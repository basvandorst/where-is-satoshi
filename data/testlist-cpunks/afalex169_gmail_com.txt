well, it
seems too good to be truth.
Recently we"ve got a lot of projects like that.
Yes, there are enthusiasts.
A real good ones.
But we should also ask ourselves,
(except what tpb-crypto mentiond), who these guys are? Could they be a
project of... the NSA itself?
I read their security section. The first thing in my mind (i am not tooooo
paranoid:)) is that it is too good. It is absolutely free WITHOUT any
mention of donations.
Not even a mention.
Who supports them? Can we trust him/it?
Are they millionaires:)?
We see not even one word about the money.
Second of all, when you read their
security section, its like a honey for bees - it invites you. Its ideal.
Too much ideal.
So yes, i rely on my feelings too, and there is something wrong with that.
These guys are from Germany:
It seems to me a better choice (except the problem of the fact that Germany
has got its nsa=bnd and that they give everything to nsa)
In the end, we need to trust someone. But we dont read their minds:). And
it could be, after all, a big fall.
We"ve got pgp. Thanks God.

References: Brad Cabana
The West's Shame
There is something so bizarre, so inhumane about Western countries
boycotting the parade for the 70th anniversary of the Soviet victory over
Germany in World War II that I just had to write on it. Recently, the prime
minister of the United Kingdom announced he will not be attending the
parade. Previous to that, countries like Germany and the United States had
announced the same. It's only a parade you say? No it's more than that.
The Soviet Union sacrificed 25 million people to defeat Nazi Germany in
World War II. A sacrifice beyond imagination, and far, far greater than all
the countries fighting Nazi Germany combined. In comparison, the Holocaust,
which is rightly remembered annually, claimed the lives of six million
people of the Jewish faith. These are really the two true tragedy's of
World War II unleashed on the world by Nazi Germany. The stories of Soviet
soldiers advancing without weapons to pickup the rifle of the next dead
soldier are well known. The bloodbath of Stalingrad, the siege of
Leningrad, the millions of Soviet soldiers killed and captured (only to
then die in POW camps) during the early days of the German invasion, and so
on, all markers of the brutality of man against his own, stand large in the
history of the world. In fact, the German invasion of the Soviet Union
stands as the largest military battle in the history of man.
Yet, western leaders have decided to not attend the parade that is meant to
honour that sacrifice. When Britain announced it would not attend, well,
that's the straw that broke the camel's back frankly. Of all the countries
in the world, Britain was saved by the massive waves of young Soviet men
and woman that bled the German army white. Hitler would have crushed
Britain in short order if he had not diverted millions of German men to the
invasion of the Soviet Union. Crucially, the diversion of aircraft,
fighters and bombers, to the Soviet front saved Britain from the entire
annihilation of a full blown, continuous air campaign, and the subsequent
naval invasion that would certainly have occurred. In reality, the western
allies left Stalin almost alone in Europe to battle the Nazi's, and take
the majority of the casualties in doing so. By the time D-Day finally
arrived, the German army and air force was only a shadow of it's former
self as it existed in 1941. As bad and hard as it was for the allies to
march east through Europe to Berlin, without the Soviet people's sacrifice,
it would have never happened.
It's a place of honour in human history. To quarrel with that is to go
beyond ignorance. To quarrel with that is the hateful and arrogant bastion
of the very seeds that caused World War II in the first place. And now, as
if history is repeating itself, Western leaders have entered that bastion
of ignorance and arrogance to punish Russia for the Ukrainian civil war. By
contrast, Russian president Putin, despite the ongoing conflict in Ukraine,
attended the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in France last year. He
was given the proverbial cold shoulder by western leaders, yet he subjected
himself to that, in honour of the sacrifice of the men of Canada, Britain
and the United States. He did not ignore the history or the price in blood
of that action. He honoured it. He put the sacrifice ahead of his political
position, and it could even be said his personal shunning. Now that the
time is here to do the same for the Soviet Union's dead, we cannot bring
ourselves to do the same.
What that says about us is really quite obvious. It means we haven't
learned the lessons of history. That our political leadership has become so
petty, so detached from historical reality, that it attempts to rewrite the
history of 25 million souls. That is the danger of all of this. Russians
don't really need the West to honour their sacrifice. They know it all too
well. It's the West that needs to honour that sacrifice so it can clearly
see the dangers of war on a scale far more destructive than anything it
experienced on the western front, or anywhere else in history. Poland
started this train rolling by refusing to invite the Russian president to
the Holocaust remembrance at Auschwitz last year. This despite the fact
that the Soviet army liberated all of Poland, and specifically Auschwitz
from German armies.
The actions of our western politicians say more about us than the Russians
could ever say themselves. They have portrayed us as people who refuse to
honour the dead, those that gave their lives in another time to defeat a
tyrant bent on world domination, and in doing so dishonour those men and
women. As the son of a young man, training in England, fighting in North
Africa, Italy, Holland, and Germany through those tumultuous years of war
and senseless slaughter, I recognize the Soviet sacrifice that probably
saved my Dad's life. How could you not? Yet, that is exactly what our
politicians are doing today. You don't have to be a lover of this country,
or that country to recognize and honour grave human injustice committed on
a massive scale. You just have to be humane, and subordinate your own bias
in the remembrance of the fallen. Is that really so hard? Isn't that what
is expected of us all? Wouldn't we expect that from our children? I've
never been so ashamed of the actions of our governments than I am now with
the boycott of that parade in Moscow.

@_subject: The USA Fake Of The Moon Landings 
Part 1:
Part 2:
*Stanley Kubrick Confesses To Faking The Moon Landings*
A stunning new video has emerged 15 years after Stanley Kubrick’s death in
which Kubrick allegedly admits that the NASA moon landings were faked.
Filmmaker T. Patrick Murray says he interviewed Kubrick three days before
his death in March 1999. He was forced to sign an 88-page NDA to keep the
contents of the interview a secret for 15 years.
Below is a transcript from the interview with Stanley Kubrick, in which the
2001 Space Odyssey Director admits on camera that, “the moon landings ALL
were faked , and that I was the person who filmed it.”
We have included a leaked rough cut of the film below the transcript as
well as two unedited raw videos of the interview with Kubrick below that:
*K: I’m so preoccupied. With my work, innovation, risk-taking, regrets…T:
Why are you giving this interview?K: Because, it started to get to me after
awhile. Well, this is difficult, because it is the first time I’ve talked
about it. (sighs)T: Sure, take all the time you need.K: I’ve always been
conflicted by it, but not consciously until years later. I was just blown
away by the chance, the opportunity, the challenge of making this, this
production, and I went into this like it was a regular film, like another
regular film of mine, not thinking too much about uh the long term effects
of what it would mean to society if it was ever discovered.T: What are you
talking about? I’m dying to know what you’re talking about.K: Well, a
confession of sorts. A movie I made, that nobody is aware of – even though
they’ve seen it.T: A movie you made, no one knows you made? Is that what
you said?K: That’s right. Is that intriguing? Do I have you intrigued?K: I
perpetrated a huge fraud on the American public, which I am now about to
detail, involving the United States government and NASA, that the moon
landings were faked, that the moon landings ALL were faked , and that I was
the person who filmed it.T: Ok. (laughs) What are you talking…You’re
serious. Ok.K: I’m serious. Dead serious.K: Yes, it was fake.T: Ok. Wait.
Wait…T: I don’t want this to be an R-rated film, but seriously, what the
blank, but seriously…T: I, I, I worked almost eight months to secure this
once in a lifetime interview that almost no else could ever get, and
instead of talking about his sixteen films that I’ve endured since I was a
child…That we didn’t land on the moon, you’re saying?K: No, we didn’t.K: It
was not real.T: The moon landings were fake?K: A, a, a.. fictional moon
landing. A fantasy. It was not real.K: Don’t you think it’s important for
people to know the truth?T: The moon landing in ’69, which was two years
before my birth…K: Is total fiction.T: Total fiction.T: Is that?…So, that’s
the 15 year thing. So that’s makes sense now. That’s why I can’t release it
for 15 years now, that makes total sense now.T: Did we…we didn’t land on
the moon you’re saying?K: No, we didn’t.T: Why are you telling me?K: A, a,
a, a massive fraud. An unparalleled fraud perpetrated against them. They
SHOULD know.K: Nixon want to uh, they were planning, yeah, he want to fake
this, this moon landing…T: Are you contending that people DON’T want to
know the truth about the world, reality, the moon landings…?K: The
government, knowing this, takes advantage of it by perpetrating fraud after
fraud after fraud.T: How did you end up giving in? Being complicit with
this fraud?K: I didn’t want to do it.T: This is NOT where I thought this
interview was going!K: With my help, with my, with my aid, and it is, it is
bothering me.T: I only have this certain amount of time with you. And I’ll
talk about whatever you want, but…T: You’re not…This isn’t some type of
joke, or…K: No. No, it’s not.T: Or a film within a film thing…K: Not
joking. NOPE.T: Okay.K: The conspiracy theorists were right, on this
occasion.T: I don’t know what to ask you first.K: I thought it was wrong, I
just…I didn’t believe in perpetrating a fraud like that.T: But you did.K:
It also undermined my artistic integrity to do that.T: Ok, but you ended up
saying yes. Why?K: Well, yes, but because basically I was bribed. To put it
bluntly, that’s what it was. It was just a plain fucking bribe.T: Why are
you telling me?K:A, a, a, massive fraud. An unparalleled fraud perpetrated
against them. They SHOULD know! Don’t you think it’s important for people
to know the truth?T: Why did they have to fake it? Why? Why would they ever
need to do something like that? Why would the government ever want or need
to do…K: It’s no secret that NASA always wanted to fulfill this Kennedy
prophecy.T: Take it from the beginning…T: I gotta be honest, this is where
he (Kubrick) got me. I mean, when I actually put myself in his position,
when I actually imagine that he was telling the truth, and that he was
presented with this opportunity and if in the one in a billion chance that
I lived his life and I was presented with the same opportunity, what would
I do?T: Yeah, he wanted his approval points up and he thought nothing could
do it better than this.T: What a conflict. I mean, gosh, I can’t imagine
being presented with that opportunity. On one hand, I’d really would want
to do it, but then I’d probably say I’m committing a crime, and lying…T: It
depends, but my guess would be…no, if you’re good, but you would do it.K:
Spielberg, (inaudible) Scorsese, even Woody Allen. There isn’t one of them
who wouldn’t do this.T: I gotta admit: I’d do it. I’d do it too.T: But they
dangled all this power and all this flattery on you, essentially?K: Yeah,
it got to me after awhile. You can listen to so much of that stuff before
you start to believe it.T: They just said you were the greatest and
stuff?K: Yeah, yeah – and I agreed with them.K: Why are you telling the
world? Why does the world need to know that the moon landings aren’t real
and you faked them?K: Which I consider to be my masterpiece.T: And you
can’t take credit, or even talk about…K: Well, I am now..T: Right, so
you’ll be dead. In ten years, or 15…K: Right, ten or 15 something like
that.T: So, you can’t talk to Roger Ebert about it. Does that frustrate
you?T: Why did they have to fake it? Why would they have to do that?K:
Because it is impossible to get there.T: Ok, back up, back up, back up….*

oh... this mainstream argument is so expected. wau.
The Wikipedia & USFake Nasa are the most reliable resources on earth,
aren't they?
*Those retro-reflectors were planted on the Moon by HUMAN BEINGS and they
couldn't be planted by a moon-walker robot (like the Russians did before
Apollo program)?...*
And in the meantime, think about the following logical question:
Why is it that today (almost 50 years AFTER the moon fairy tale), the
Americans buy Russian engines in order to deliver their rockets into cosmic
orbit? Where are the pooower engines of the "grand" Apollo program? There
are no such. *Then on which engines Americans flew to the moon 50 years
ago?* This technology was "lost" or stolen by the "bloody soviet agents"...
or maybe it has never been existed like their human landings?!
Moreover, there is very basic question like:
Where is the solid evidence that these retro-reflectors are indeed American
and not... Russian? The Russians sent to the moon several moonwalkers
"Lunokhod" who left there a similar technique before the Americans mission
began in the mid-60s.
Also, we can question the whole Apollo program and not only the human
landings - not only on which engines Americans flew to the moon, but what
happened to the "hundreds" of kg of lunar soil, allegedly brought to earth
by the the Apollo expeditions? We want them to give, let's say, 10 kg to an
INTERNATIONAL (not USfake) scientific organization with Russian and Chinese
scientists who will investigate it (oh, sorry, it's too secret and maybe
too altruistic for the "God's chosen nation" which cares about the welfare
of the whole world).
And most of all, as i already said:
*Where is the solid evidence that these retro-reflectors were delivered
personally by HUMAN astronauts to the moon, and not by moonwalker as was
done by the Russians years before the fake Apollo program?*
*Тhere are no material, univocal and NON-american evidences for already
over half a century.And the rest - is policy and propaganda. Very dirty.
Like the fake tube that Colin Powell shook** in the UN before the invasion
to Iraq.*
As my friend said "this moon folklore is too dear to their hearts", is'nt
Well, it is not "more dear" than the folklore of the communist
threat/Vietnam/Bosnia/Iraq/ 9-11/the bloody Putin. And the best of all is
the folklore that "we are the chosen (by whom?!) leaders of the earth, =>
thus only we are the good guys and everyone else, who is not our economic
slave, is BAD => and should be destroyed "for the sake of the world".
*Question everything that has ever been done by all USA officials
(especially the last 80 years). At least 90% of all their words and actions
are lies, provocations and deceitful propaganda. There has never been in
the human history such a rotten and vile government & ruling elite as it is
in the USA (as a consequence, weak and deceived nation).*
Those moon fake landings are just the edge of the iceberg.

I can't believe i read bullshit like these kind of arguments from educated
persons. Well, i will try to answer in the most political-correct manner.
It's my last comment on the Moon issue, i promise.
It is not pointless at all, buddy. Because the past SHAPES the present.
There is NO today without yesterday. And there is NO "good" today with
"rotten" yesterday (part of which is the moon flam).
We are talking here about a lie. A LIE as big as the size of the moon. *And
if a state can lie such lies, this kind of state has no right to call
itself "democratic/special/good/free/honest" state... or the leader of the
human race. Not talking about bombing other states "for the good sake of
all the others". Such State should be called with an appropriate name. And
have no rights on the world stage, not to mention a Leadership.*
It is indeed pointless to talk about the "great new world of today" which
you and many others see through pink glasses (and there is no such world
today). Because the US fabrication like the "moon" lie is shaping our
present (which you love so much), and even more -
*it is continuing to happen "HERE & NOW".*
Now, the US lie is not about the "moon" but about the bad Assad in Syria,
chemicals in Iraq, freedom to Lybian people, Russian invasion to
Ukraine...etc. It's all happening right here and right now, buddy (On
20/12/2015). *And will continue to happen until good and smart people will
believe in these lies *(this is the cause i write to this list trying to
prevent this)*. Or until there will be "sheeple" like you, who live in an
illusive "here & now" without caring about their yesterday/the truth.*

Yes it is. 90% of it is a cheap and rubbish propaganda.
And if you didn't know, in Russia itself, there are A LOT of "bought"
journalists & media channels by the west.
The Russian government supports the violent murder of the LGBT+ community.
I think one could not say/write in more stupid way something about the
Russian government. It supports "violent" murder ONLY of terrorists and
soldiers from the armies of aggressors who invade in its sovereign land
(Napoleon, Hitler etc.).
As for the objective reality
There are indeed some murder cases of LGBT people in Russia every year. But
if you didn't know, *in EVERY country* there are cases when somebody get
killed out of all kind of reasons (including homophobia) . And one CAN NOT
say it is the "government policy" because there are some freaky
pedophiles/xenophobes/homophobes... in the country. Their percentage is
insignificant and not more than in the same greaat and bOOOld democratic US.
So, cut off your bullshit and stop whining.

@_subject: A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace 
by John Perry Barlow
Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I
come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask
you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have
no sovereignty where we gather.
We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address
you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always
speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally
independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral
right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true
reason to fear.
Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You
have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not
know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your
borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public
construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows
itself through our collective actions.
You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you
create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our
ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order
than could be obtained by any of your impositions.
You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this
claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't
exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will
identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social
Contract . This governance will arise according to the conditions of our
world, not yours. Our world is different.
Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself,
arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a
world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.
We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice
accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.
We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her
beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence
or conformity.
Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and
context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no
matter here.
Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by
physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest,
and the commonweal, our governance will emerge . Our identities may be
distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our
constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope
we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we
cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.
In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications
Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams
of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These
dreams must now be born anew in us.
You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world
where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust
your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly
to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of
humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole,
the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes
from the air upon which wings beat.
In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States,
you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at
the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small
time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in
bit-bearing media.
Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate
themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own
speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be
another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world,
whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed
infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires
your factories to accomplish.
These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same
position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had
to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare
our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to
consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the
Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.
We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more
humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.

*Preamble: Our hearts go out in sorrow and grief to all those families and
friends of all the truly innocent humans who were really murdered during or
after the events in Paris by whomsoever. Their violent death certainly was
and remains a heinous and appalling crime for which the real culprits must
be brought to true justice.But, we can also not close our eyes from seeing
facts, which in these increasing numbers of "terrorist-attacks" do not fit
the "official" narrative or do not match the fake news-blasts of the
masterminded mainstream media, nor can we close our ears from the likewise
appalling war-cries on all sides of those who declare and let others fight

their own people) and first of all we will not close our ears and eyes from

*A Most Convenient MassacreWhat a difference a single massacre can make!By
Dmitry Orlov*
November 17, 2015 "Information Clearing House" -  Just a week ago the EU
couldn't possibly figure out anything to do to stop the influx of
“refugees” from all those countries the US and NATO had bombed into
oblivion. But now, because “Paris changed everything,” EU's borders are
being locked down and refugees are being turned back.
• Just a week ago it seemed that the EU was going to be swamped by
resurgent nationalism, with incumbent political parties poised to get voted
out of power. But now, thanks to the Paris massacre, they have obtained a
new lease on life, because they can now safely embrace the same policies
that a week ago they branded as “fascist.”
• Just a week ago the EU and the US couldn't possibly bring themselves
admit that they are utterly incompetent when it comes to combating their
own creation—ISIS, that is—and need Russian help. But now, at the
après-Paris G-20 summit, everybody is ready to line up and let Putin take
charge of the war against terrorism. Look—the Americans finally found those
convoys of tanker trucks stretching beyond the horizon that ISIS has been
using to smuggle out stolen Syrian crude oil—after Putin showed them the
satellite photos!
Am I being crass and insensitive? Not at all—I deplore all the deaths from
terrorist attacks in Iraq, in Syria, in Lebanon, and in all the other
countries whose populations did absolutely nothing to deserve such
treatment. I only feel half as bad about the French, who stood by quietly
as their military helped destroy Libya (which did nothing to deserve it).
*Note that after the Russian jet crashed in the Sinai there weren't all
that many Facebook avatars with the Russian flag pasted over them, and
hardly any candlelight vigils or piles of wreaths and flowers in various
Western capitals. I even detected a whiff of smug satisfaction that the
Russians got their comeuppance for stepping out of line in Syria.Why the
difference in reaction? Simple: you were told to grieve for the French, so
you did. You were not told to grieve for the Russians, and so you didn't.
Don't feel bad; you are just following orders. The reasoning behind these
orders is transparent: the French, along with the rest of the EU, are
Washington's willing puppets; therefore, they are innocent, and when they
get killed, it's a tragedy. But the Russians are not Washington's willing
puppet, and are not innocent, and so when they get killed by terrorists,
it's punishment. And when Iraqis, or Syrians, or Nigerians get killed by
terrorists, that's not a tragedy either, for a different reason: they are
too poor to matter. In order to qualify as a victim of a tragedy, you have
to be each of these three things: 1. a US-puppet, 2. rich and 3. dead.*
Also, you probably believe that the terrorist attacks in Paris were the
genuine article—nobody knew it would happen, and it couldn't have been
stopped, because these terrorists are just too clever for the ubiquitous
state surveillance to detect. Don't feel bad about that either; you are
just believing what you are told to believe. You probably also believe that
jet fuel can melt steel girders and that skyscrapers collapse into their
own footprints (whether they've been hit by airplanes or not). You can
certainly believe whatever you like, but here are a couple of
easy-to-understand tips on telling what's real from what's fake:
1. If it's fake, the perpetrators are known immediately (and sometimes
beforehand). If it's real, then the truth is uncovered as a result of a
thorough investigation. So, for instance, on 9/11 the guilty party were a
bunch of Saudis armed with box cutters (some of whom are, paradoxically,
still alive). And in Paris we knew right away that this was done by
ISIS—even before we knew who the perpetrators were. And when that Malaysian
jet got shot down over Ukraine, we knew right away that it was the
Russians' fault (never mind that on that day the Ukrainians deployed an air
defense system, and also scrambled a couple of jets armed with air-to-air
missiles— against an enemy that doesn't have an air force). Note, however,
how we still don't know what happened with the Russian jet over Sinai (the
article was written on November 17, 2015 - before the Russian investigation
revealed the ISIS bomb in the jet). That case is still under
investigation—as it should be. If it's real, officials stall for time and
urge caution while scrambling to find out what happened. When it's fake,
the officials are ready to go with the Big Lie, and then do everything they
can to make it stick, suppressing what shreds of evidence can be
independently gathered.
2. If it's fake, than you should also expect cute little touches: designer
logos for publicity campaigns ready to launch at a moment's notice, be it
“Je suis Charlie” or that cute little Eiffel Tower inscribed in a peace
symbol. There weren't any props to go with the Russian jet disaster—unless
you count that tasteful Charlie Hebdo cartoon of a jihadi rocket having
anal sex with an airliner. There might also be a few traditional titbits
designed to feed a media frenzy, such as a fake passport found lying next
to one of the perpetrators—because when terrorists go on suicide missions
they always take their fake passports with them. The people who are charged
with designing these events lack imagination and usually just go with
whatever worked before.
We should certainly expect there to be more fake massacres of this
sort—whenever the political situation becomes sufficiently fraught to call
for one—because at this point ready-to-go jihadi terrorist cells are
something of a sunk cost and can be deployed very cheaply and effectively.
Of course we should grieve for the victims, but there is something far more
important at stake than mere human lives, which are, deplorably, becoming
cheaper with each passing year. We should grieve for the truth.

** was originally by William H. Depperman ​​whd2 at columbia.edu
 to the tor list.*
Hi Mailing List People,
            I am apparently  the number one person in the United States on
the _*NSA-CIA-FBI Watch List*_. For multiple reasons! I am the Coordinator
of the United Front Against Racism and Capitalism-Imperialism who was
arrested by the so-called "Major Case Squad" in August 1986 because our
group exposed the scientific documentation on a big series of _/*huge*/_
wall posters that AIDS is Biological Warfare by the US Government Against
Blacks, Gays and those with certain blood dyscrasias. The arrest was on the
front pages of all NYC newspapers and on Channel 4 in Europe. I tried to
send this email to Anonymous and TOR does not permit attachments so just
disregard that when you see an attachment mentioned.
            Recently I was _*Extraordinarily Renditioned*_ (KIDNAPPED AND
HELD AGAINST MY WILL FOR 18 HOURS AND TORTURED after simply walking along a
road in New Jersey!) See the third attachment. The NSA has TOTAL control of
my computer and has real time keystroke by keystroke monitoring and
harassment while I am on the computer. My anti-virus and anti-Malware are
totally useless as explained by Snowden because the computer is controlled
through the _*BIOS Chip*_ as explained in the attachment on Snowden
revelations. Scroll down the document until you get to _*ANT*_ (Access
Network Technology). I would like for _*Anonymous*_ to publish on its
website for EVERYONE, not just me,  how to remove and neutralize NSA
viruses placed on the BIOS CHIP! Also please send the information in an
email to me. I am sure you could manage this. If THEY can do it and YOU are
the world's greatest hackers just like they are, then YOU can neutralize
any garbage they place on the BIOS Chip. Kaspersky by refusing to help me
in this also SUPPORTS NSA placement of virus software on the BIOS Chip
because that confirms that I am one of the capitalists' most important
enemies and therefore I am an are automatic enemy of Kaspersky. So I can go
screw! Will I receive the same response from Anonymous? It is a rule of
capitalist statecraft that a government control and operate its own
opposition by one means or another any and ALL means. Anonymous is a
supposed opposition group. So who is _/*really*/_ running anonymous and
please do not say "everyone" or "no one" because that is the same BS answer
given by the anti-Communist Anarchist group,  so-called "Occupy Wall
Street." _*I need immediate help*_. And so undoubtedly do others! I am
partially computer savvy. But I am not yet a programmer.

*FBI can demand web history, phone location data without a warrant*
The FBI can use national security letters (NSLs) to force companies to turn
over sensitive user data without a warrant, according to filings.
By Zack Whittaker for Zero Day  | November 30, 2015 --
16:35 GMT (08:35 PST) | Topic: Security
The FBI can compel companies and individuals to turn over vast sums of
personal data without a warrant, it has been revealed for the first time.
In a case that's lasted more than a decade, a court filing released Monday
 showed how the
FBI used secret interpretations to determine the scope of national security
letters (NSLs).
Nicholas Merrill, founder of internet provider Calyx Internet Access, who
brought the 11-year-old case to court after his company was served a
national security letter, won the case earlier this year.
National security letters are almost always bundled with a gag order,
preventing Merrill from speaking freely about the letter he received.
While it was known that national security letters can demand customer and
user data, it wasn't known exactly what.
In a statement on Monday, Merrill revealed the FBI has used its authority
to force companies and individuals to turn over complete web browsing
history; the IP addresses of everyone a person has corresponded with;
online purchase information, and also cell-site location information, which
he said can be used to turn a person's phone into a "location tracking
According to a release ,
the FBI can also force a company to release postal addresses, email
addresses, and "any other information which [is] considered to be an
electronic communication transactional record."
Merrill said in remarks: "The FBI has interpreted its NSL authority to
encompass the websites we read, the web searches we conduct, the people we
contact, and the places we go. This kind of data reveals the most intimate
details of our lives, including our political activities, religious
affiliations, private relationships, and even our private thoughts and
Federal district judge Victor Marrero described in his decision that the
FBI's position was "extreme and overly broad."
He also found that the FBI's overbroad gag order on Mr. Merrill "implicates
serious issues, both with respect to the First Amendment and accountability
of the government to the people."
Merrill is the first person who has succeeded in completely lifting a
national security letter gag order.
The Patriot Act expanded the reach of national security letters when it was
signed into law a month after the September 11 attacks in 2001.
More than ten thousand national security letters are issued by the FBI
every year, without a warrant or judicial oversight.
These letters have been surrounded with controversy for years, leading to
many unsuccessful attempts to litigate against them. Major companies,
including Google
have challenged national security letters, with little luck. Microsoft
recently challenged an order, which led to the FBI to withdraw the demand
In 2008, a US court found the National Security Letter statute, amended by
the Patriot Act in 2001, was unconstitutional.
In a separate case in 2013, the gag order provision was found to be in
breach of the First Amendment
The government appealed the ruling.

The Management of Dissent: How to Destroy an Activist
By Janet Phelan While the West, and the United States in particular, has repeatedly voiced
criticism over human rights abuses in other countries, the US’s own record
in terms of detaining and incarcerating dissidents is now becoming
In presenting a recent report on human rights issues, US Secretary of State
John Kerry stated: *“Here is the truth, we believe: A government that fails
to respect human rights, no matter how lofty its pretentions, has very
little to boast about, to teach, and very little indeed in the way of
reaching its full potential
.” *
This report itself is heavily weighted in terms of naming Asian and Middle
Eastern countries as human rights abusers. Kerry reports that *“In every
part of the world, we see an accelerating trend by both state and non-state
actors to close the space for civil society, to stifle media and Internet
freedom, to marginalize opposition voices, and in the most extreme cases,
to kill people or drive them from their homes
.” *
The United States is not named in the report.
However, the US is itself a major culpable actor in such abuses. Despite
its continuing and increasingly strained efforts to self-promote as a
defender of human rights, the US is now inhibiting media and internet
freedom as well as regularly imprisoning activists–often without trial.
The world is already aware of the use of the Espionage Act to imprison and
otherwise intimidate whistleblowers. The cases of Bradley Manning
, Jeffrey Sterline
,  James Hitselberger
,      John
Kiriakou ,   and
others have hit the mainstream press
What the world may not be aware of is that non-CIA connected individuals,
who are merely attempting to correct and/ or broadcast injustices, are now
facing jail time.
*You Mean I Forgot to Tell You About Your Trial?*
Tim Lahrman is a name well known to disability rights activists. A trained
paralegal, Tim has been volunteering his paralegal skills to a growing list
of people who are engaged in legal battles against guardians and lawyers.
For those unacquainted with the issues concerning adult guardianships, an
overview reveals that these guardianships constitute a legal loophole
through which an individual may be declared incompetent and then stripped
of all his assets and the lion’s share of his rights. In fact, upon the
initiation of such a guardianship, the alleged incapacitated person may not
even be allowed to hire a lawyer to defend against the guardianship. The
National Association to Stop Guardian Abuse’s website has a compelling
summary of what rights are lost when one goes under a guardianship
Robin Gibson, a Los Angeles woman, attributes Tim Lahrman’s legal expertise
to the successful resolution of an ongoing legal conflict with the guardian
for her mother.  Recently, the mother was released from a guardianship
which Gibson states was draining her mother’s estate and wherein the
guardian, Frumeh Labow
, had
virtually sequestered the older woman from contact with the outside world.
*“I owe this all to Tim,“* pronounced an exhilarated Robin Gibson in a
recent interview. *“I have finally got my mother back.“*
Gibson is only one of many who have benefited from Lahrman’s legal acumen
and skills. And she may be one of the last. For Tim Lahrman now sits in an
Indiana jail cell, held without bail on two seventeen year- old misdemeanor
Candice Schwager, an attorney from Texas, has this to say about Lahrman’s
incarceration:  *“There is an entirely different agenda behind this
seventeen year old persecution. It’s not even reasonable to think that
Goshen keeps misdemeanor cold case files and this was bad luck. This arrest
was retribution because Tim has brought up the crimes of a clouted
political figure.”*
Tim Lahrman was himself placed under a guardianship in 1987. He was at that
point in time in his twenties and an owner of a thriving automotive
business which was subsequently ravaged through the guardianship
Lahrman’s guardianship was never legally terminated. After sacking his
business, the guardian, Kenneth Scheibenberger, “just sort of wandered
off,” according to Lahrman.
This left Tim Lahrman in legal limbo. Neither his rights nor his property
were ever restored to him. He was left, in essence, as a legal zero.
As the law states, Lahrman thus could not have had the “legal capacity” to
commit the two misdemeanors with which he was charged in 1999 —driving with
a suspended license and possession of a small amount of marijuana.
Tim filed legal notice in the misdemeanor case of his stated “lack of
capacity.” The court took no notice and, after oddly failing in its legal
mandate to summon him for his trial, held the trial without him present,
found him guilty and sentenced him to two years. He was not present at the
hearing and was not subsequently apprehended.
Fast forward to 2016. Tim is not only assisting others in their
guardianship cases but has now filed a number of lawsuits in his own matter
Filed on January 20, 2015 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Indiana, South Bend Division, Tim Lahrman also sued Elkhart
County Superior Court No. 2 (Stephen R. Bowers, Judge), the Chief Judge of
the Indiana Court of Appeals, the State of Indiana, the Office of Indiana
Attorney General and the Indiana Supreme Court Division of State Court
Administration. Lahrman was picked up in March of this year on the
seventeen year- old stale and expired warrant, and is being held in Elkhart
County Jail without bail. His writ of Habeas Corpus, filed with the court
this past week, was reportedly denied by Judge Bodie Stegelmann. According
to reports, Judge Stegelmann has ordered Lahrman into a psychiatric
Attorney Schwager, who has filed notice in this case, states that Tim was
put into “the hole”—solitary confinement—this past week after asking his
public defender for her name and also requesting the court file. The
request apparently frightened her. Schwager has more
the case.
The public defender subsequently withdrew and the judge has ordered Tim to
appear pro se—without legal counsel.
*I Don’t Know You But I Am Sure You Are Incompetent*
Another disability rights activist, Cary Andrew Crittenden, is now being
held in Santa Clara County Jail, in Northern California, after being
arrested on Christmas Eve on “secret charges.”
We can only term the charges “secret” because the Santa Clara County
Prosecutor’s office has consistently refused to honor its legal
responsibility to release the records containing the factual circumstances
surrounding Crittenden’s arrest. The California Public Records Act,
clarified by the court case known as “Kusar” mandates the release of these
Crittenden, who has launched an internet campaign against corruption in
Santa Clara County was previously arrested in Santa Clara County for making
online statements about public officials which were deemed to be “
An internal affairs complaint was filed on February 11 with the
Prosecutor’s office concerning the refusal of Assistant District Attorney
David Angel to comply with the records disclosure law, which is in place in
order to guard against “secret arrests.” This IA complaint appears to have
gone the way of the public’s rights to know—into the garbage can. No action
has been taken on the complaint.
The recipient of the complaint, a Lt. Jorge Perez, who states he is an
investigator with the DA’s office, has refused to even release the name of
the individual who has been assigned to investigate the complaint
concerning ADA David Angel’s refusal to comply with the law.
Recently, there was an attempt to have Crittenden declared incompetent to
stand trial. If an individual is so deemed, he may be incarcerated
indefinitely without ever having his day in court. Sniffing this rat,
Crittenden refused to attend the psychiatric evaluation which the court had
set up for him.
In a bizarre, Kafkaesque effort, a “doctor” –who never saw or evaluated
Cary Andrew Crittenden–trotted himself into court. In a declaration that
would have made any surrealist proud, Dr. Burke, the “doc-in the pocket” of
the court, intoned that in his professional opinion, Crittenden, a man he
had never seen, was “incompetent to stand trial.”
The fact that Burke had never evaluated Crittenden did not escape the
attention of the court, however. Crittenden was ordered into another
evaluation, and the subsequent medical professional reportedly determined
that Crittenden was indeed competent.
The propensity for courts now to order activists and dissidents into
psychiatric evaluation is something that deserves special attention. A
person adjudicated incompetent by a court may, in fact, never get a trial.
He can be locked up indefinitely on minor and potentially bogus charges and
also be court- ordered to be forcibly  medicated with anti- psychotics,
which constitute a chemical strait jacket.
If you think that the cases involving Lahrman and Crittenden are the
exception, you may rest assured that, for cases involving guardianship
activists, this is standard court operating procedure. Rosanna Miller, who
was attempting to protect her father’s interests while he was under
guardianship, was arrested in 2014 for failure to pay court costs. The Ohio
Supreme Court, however, had issued a memo stating that an individual cannot
be arrested for failure to pay court costs.
Questions were raised about the possibility that the Bellafontaine judge,
Ann Beck, was involved in a number of financial improprieties. Beck then
quickly released Miller from custody. Barbara Stone, a NY attorney whose
mother, Helen, was under a questionable guardianship in Florida, was
arrested and charged with “custody interference”—which mandates a potential
sentence of five years in prison—for allegedly taking her mother to lunch.
*If I Can’t Get You, I’ll Get Your Kid*
The psychiatric incarceration of John Rohrer raises further questions about
motives to detain this young man, and detain him possibly indefinitely.
Rohrer, who apparently wandered into the wrong house while under the
influence of a hallucinogen, has now been detained over ten years, the last
six and a half years as an in-patient in a state psychiatric facility. The
case has been fraught with illegal maneuvers by the prosecutors and judge,
including denying him his right multiple times to hearings to determine
whether he meets the state’s definition of being “mentally ill.” In fact,
Rohrer has never been deemed incompetent. Rohrer is now being held at
Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare, a State psychiatric hospital, where he
was forcibly drugged for years.
It should be noted that the Ohio Supreme Court has determined that a judge
may not order forced drugging unless he makes a finding that the individual
lacks capacity to consent. The forced drugging must also be in the
patient’s “best interests” and there must not be any alternatives deemed to
be as effective as the drugging. In the Rohrer case, Judge Corzine made
none of these findings, and in fact stated on the record that Rohrer
appeared “pretty lucid today.”
Nevertheless, Corzine ordered the forced drugging of John Rohrer.
According to reports, during a brief 2007 exposure to Risperdal, Rohrer,
who was at that time 27 years old, suffered a cardiac event, but this did
not stop it from being chosen as the primary drug to forcibly inject.
Medical and legal malpractice complaints were filed November 24, 2014 in
the Ohio Court of Claims and November 28, 2014 in the Franklin County
Common Pleas Court by the attorney for John Rohrer. The complaint states
that Rohrer was forcibly injected with Risperdal for more than 3 ½ years
although the drug is known to cause irreversible brain damage. In addition,
the complaint states that Rohrer’s rights to a fair hearing have been
repeatedly violated.
The activist in the Rohrer case is actually his mother. Attorney and talk
show host Katherine Hine founded the advocacy group Stop Child Abuse Now in
Oklahoma and advised a group of foster mothers who were outraged at the
involvement of judges and lawyers in the murder of 2 year old Ryan Luke in
1995. She is the Executive Director of the Ross County Network for Children
in Ohio, an organization with a strong history of conflict with the Ross
County Prosecutors, surrounding two child murderers that the County had not
wanted prosecuted back in the 1990’s.
Hine is now with WJLA radio hosting a two weekly broadcasts—one exposing
illegalities of forced psychiatry and another exposing the consequences of
the lack of judicial accountability. She also is a contributor to The
Columbus Free Press.
The Ross County Prosecutor’s office has made it clear that they despise
her. Now, they are the ones making sure John Rohrer stays locked up.
Hine has faced three disciplinary actions.  She writes, “My first
discipline was in Oklahoma in like 1981 or 1982 when my soon to be ex
grabbed by children in violation of an Oklahoma custody order giving their
temporary custody to me.” According to Hine, “He claimed he wasn’t served.”
She reports that “I got a private reprimand – where you go into an office
and they yell at you about 15 minutes.  Told me what a disgrace to the
profession I was and how ashamed they all were of being in the bar
association with me.”
She was subsequently reprimanded by the Oklahoma Bar in 1997 for
communicating with a judge concerning a matter involving a suspected case
of child abuse, in which she did not represent a party
. In
fact, Hine had signed a letter along with seven other individuals who were
concerned that the judge had authorized supervised visitation of a child
with a sexual predator and that the supervision stipulation was being
ignored. In other words, the child was allowed to be alone with the
predator. There was another attempt at discipline when she was accused of
ghost writing for a pro se litigant, but Hine invoked confidentiality and
the complaint evaporated.
Concerning the lengthy incarceration of her son, Katherine Hine has this to
say: “These people are like the Cosa Nostra. They launch intergenerational
vendettas and will go after your family.”
According to Hine, John Rohrer is no longer allowed online. He had
previously set up websites with his music and poetry but the public
awareness of his situation had launched protests among his readers and as a
result, he is now barred by the hospital from going onto the internet.
Recent articles have discussed the increasing incidence of suspension and
disciplinary actions taken against attorneys who are attempting to protect
the rights of individuals
. If
the current trend continues, we may see anyone standing up for the rights
of another individual escorted into jail and, from there, potentially into
a rubber room.

​Sci-Hub: Russian neuroscientist running 'Pirate Bay for scientists'
 - with 48 million free academic papers -
... to remove all barriers in the way of science
By Mary-Ann Russon  - February 15, 2016
A website illegally offering academic papers for download is fighting back
against a copyright infringement lawsuit in the US and has no intention of
giving up Sci-Hub
*knowledge to all*
*We fight inequality in knowledge access across the world. The scientific
knowledge should be available for every person regardless of their income,
social status, geographical location and etc.*
*Our mission is to remove any barrier which impeding the widest possible
distribution of knowledge in human society!*
Sci-Hub, a website dubbed the "Pirate Bay for scientists" by offering
peer-reviewed academic papers to download for free, is thumbing its nose at
copyright holders following an infringement lawsuit battle in the US.
Sci-Hub  is the brainchild of Alexandra Elbakyan, a
neuroscientist from Kazakhstan who is now based in Russia. When she was
writing her thesis in 2009, Elbakyan found it difficult to access the
research she needed to complete her work, as she needed to download many
papers, and each paper retailed for up to $30 (£21) each.
To get through her thesis, Elbakyan was forced to download pirated versions
of the academic papers for free, and eventually, after being introduced to
a website that enabled researchers to share and trade the academic papers
they needed with people who had paid for them, she decided to take the idea
further and create her own website around 2011 or 2012.
Tricking journals with university proxies
Today, the Sci-Hub website boasts 48 million academic papers and has now
gone viral, because it features technology similar to anonymising proxy
websites. Rather than just enabling users to search for and extract the
papers they need, the Sci-Hub website is programmed to automatically search
for papers on important topics and work out how to download them to its
database without spending a penny.
Since various universities in the world have paid subscriber access to
different premium journal services, the website is able to automatically
trawl through different university proxies to trick the relevant journal's
website into believing that the user accessing the academic paper has the
relevant credentials similar to a paying customer.
Once the paper is unlocked, Sci-Hub then downloads the paper to its
database and even looks for other missing papers on similar topics to
download, so that all the researcher has to do is initiate a search, and
the paper will come up, ready to be downloaded for nothing.
Apart from using Sci-Hub, the only way for researchers to gain access to
research papers without paying for them is to ask people they know, or post
on Twitter using the hashtag *Sued for copyright infringement and blocked in the US*
At its peak in 2015, the website received 80,000 visitors a day, according
to Nature magazine
and had become so popular that academic publisher Elsevier
 brought a copyright lawsuit against the
website, claiming that it had lost between $75,000 - $150,000 in revenue
due to the piracy.
On 28 October 2015, a New York district court found in favour of Elsevier
and placed a temporary injunction against Sci-Hub, as well as suspending
access to the website's Sci-Hub.org domain, which has caused visitor
numbers to drop to 30,000 a day. But other than that, not much else can be
done to physically stop Elbakyan as she has no US assets to forfeit nor is
she a US citizen, so, just like Pirate Bay's multiple domain names
she quickly moved the website to Sci-Hub.io, where it continues to be
freely accessible.
"There should be no obstacles to accessing knowledge, I believe," Elbakyan
told RT .
"[According to Article 27 of the United Nations Declaration of Human
Rights], everyone has the right to freely participate in the cultural life
of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement
and its benefits."
Moving to the Dark Web
Not only that, but Elbakyan has also moved Sci-Hub's servers onto the Dark
Web – a section of the internet not discoverable by conventional means,
such as through Google or other search engines or by directly entering a
website URL. This is where cybercriminals typically list illegal goods and
services like drugs, firearms and hackers-for-hire and using the Tor
anonymity network
as a cloak to protect their real identities.
Even better, there are a huge number of scientists in the world actively
supporting Sci-Hub and even posting YouTube tutorials on how to download
papers for free from  the
piracy portal, especially since revolting against Elsevier's high prices in
2012, with even Harvard University telling its staff that it could no
longer afford the journal price hikes
in the same year.
"Even if legal access to [Sci-Hub] is blocked, the user can still get in
through the TOR network and immediately gain access to all the articles,"
said Elbakyan. "However, we intend to fight for free access to all
information. After all, using TOR still provides obstacles."

Assertions of fact which I presume are not in dispute except perhaps by
schooled (and not educated) North Americans:
- North America/ the USA, has NO righteous authority to be the
  "policeman of the world"!
- The only authority the the USA has to be "the policeman of the world"
  is the predatorial right, the predatorial authority.
- The United States of America government is ethically bankrupt.
- The government of the USA has been co-opted by the North American (and
  western world oligarch controlled) Military Industrial Complex.
- The hegemonic intention of the government of the USA and the "neo
  conservatives" or war mongers of "the West", is a predatorial
  manifestion of the desire for empire, the desire to control the world.
      The hegemonic USA must end.
That said, here is what might be termed a human perspective of what an
average Russian living in Russia or perhaps the Donbas today, might
actually be experiencing, feeling and thinking, and why (historical
memories etc) - a somewhat moving piece for those so inclined:
"Why People Never Believe That War Is Coming – Until It Is Too Late"
In Russian: In English:
A thought:
The "terrorists" in Syria, aka IS or ISIS or ISIL, go into town,
villages and cities, forcing "conversion" or death upon those families
who live there.
The so called "terrorists" of eastern Ukraine in the Donbas/
Novorossia, are families fighting for their lives against the Ukraine
state army who are coming to "subdue" them, to "encourage" them to
accept the new Ukrainian coup government with its laws saying the
Russian language is no longer official, and no longer allowed to be
taught in their local schools, and many more abominations to "European
Oh, but it's all just "Russian aggression".
FFS, wake up European nations! wake up North Americans!
Absolutely the Ukrainian army must stop shooting and bombing its own
Absolutely the eastern Ukrainian people have a right to defend
themselves against "their own" army shooting at them, their own
"president" Poroshenko "Donbas Children Will Sit in Cellars, “Ours” Will
Go to School":
Amazing Poroshenko Video: Keep Donbas Children "Holed Up" in ...
(well at least Poroshenko said it in a civilized setting - the Odessa
Opera House.)
Poroshenko: “we [in Ukraine] will have work they – [in the Donbas]
won’t. We will have pensions – they won’t. We will care for our children
and pensioners – they won’t. Our children will go to school, to
kindergartens – their children will sit in cellars. They don’t know how
to organize or do anything. This, ultimately, is how we will win this
(this article is too intense, I can't finish reading it)
A boy holds a placard reading "Save Donbas children. Please stop ATO!"
(anti-terrorists operation) in the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa on
June 1, 2014 (AFP Photo) / AFP
(This one's a bit easier to read.)
"Someone explain to me so I can understand. How is it that Russia is
somehow negligent in influencing pro-Russian separatists in east
Ukraine, when the Kiev junta’s forces are the ones shelling civilians
daily? Does Germany’s Angela Merkel see something the world cannot? God
only knows."
                     All hail Ukraine!
   Home of the direct second and third generation Nazis!
We, the collective "West" are an absolute disgrace on this planet!!!!!
So YES if I were the USA president I would do better! The only real
challenge is doing better as USA president, and stopping yourself from
being killed for cleaning up the endless shit that is North American
foreign policy!
"The West", an absolute disgrace to humanity..

For future attempts by liars:
So apparent contradictions in the lie itself... you know, Peter/mr. X... it

I'm not sure how you can say the first part above, in the face of

You quoted the relevant part, thank you. That part does not take much

"relevant operator") is nothing more than whatever the Home Secretary

You say that as though there are good points, see above.
Thanks for quoting the relevant part of the act, and letting us know
that the definitions for "relevant operator"s will be handed down extra-

*How can you, the government, speak to us like this?*
- dismantle the global monitoring infrastructure
- rapproach with Russia (the US MIC needs an enemy to maintain
- dismantle Ramstein Air Base
- respect China

Amen, brother.
I can't believe i read such a boolshit comment from a human being with mind.
Zenaan wrote ... teared his chest apart and took out his heart, put it down
in front of all of us in this comment/essay (and not only here).. and what
do we see? Such a superficial, stupid, arrogant comment.
Again. super-superficial super-boolshit that was written by a man without
mind and heart/soul.
Hope the "silent" readers are much much more "human" than this kind of
stupidity, or more precisely - absolute emptiness.
*Zen, never reply to this kind of comments. It's pure trolling and
conscious attempt to hurt you. That's it.*

Zen, you swallowed their provocations which misled all the discussion
toward "putin VS us"/ oh, you misspelled my naaaame ;( / another bullshit
-> which is NOT the issue here at all. Reread your first-core comment/essay
which began all this thread and you'll see this total misdirection they
lead you to-> which you are swallowing here instead of ignoring.
You violated the balance (you know what i'm talking about) and all this
became a squash + vast lost of energy for you.
And here i will quote Jesus Christ:
*"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls
before swine"*
I want to protect you, so i write it to you (again) - STOP this
conversation. You wrote in a perfect manner your first essay/statement. The
others - Guninski's trollings/ AND almost empty OR MISleading comments by
others ... -> thus all this thread became casting pearls before pigs (and
those who are the pigs - know whom i'm talking about. and i'm not talking
only about those who write, but who read too).
*So... STOP. Please STOP, my precious friend.*
Take a contrast shower.
Go for a walk.
Listen to good music.
Read some good poetry/something abstract.
Watch some good old movie.
Take a good sleep.
Give some rest for your body and soul.
And try to be "quite" for a few days (at least).
You don't have the "duty" to answer ANY provocation/arrow/bullshit somebody
writes (and in many cases even good point).
You have a duty TO POINT something important out. And that's what you did
by opening this thread and writing from the depth of your heart. All the
rest is stupid loss of precious energy and feeding the conscious evil or
just stupid people-pigs here. And that's not your intention if you are not
Your Brother,
Everything what's written here refers NOT ONLY to this thread alone.

Let's play this game.
They said? Ok. I'll give you/everybody and example from my personal life:
They said? Oh, the old ladies downstairs also saying ... saying... i'm a
gay (some of them claim now a pervert one, oh, you know, slander always
evolves. and in Russia gay... is worse than a leprous)
*so WHY are they saying so?!*
a. They are really bored and evil. b. They SAW SOMETHING what they
distorted. 'cause they saw me one time "hugging some guy" (it was my
brother by the way whom i brought from the airport). AND? Am i a gay?!
'cause the whole building and many relatives of those old ladies are sure
AND say i'm a pervert gay. Ok, they say. But with your fucken logic, i am.
It's not that i have something against them, but *it's A LIE*. That's the
point here. *But people like you, who are "passioned" believe this shit
"without a trial" (a check with me, at least)*
by the way, God what a howl was one time when i played and laughed with one
of their grandchildren... that's the day i first heard this slander about
Back to your statement "So you're saying you'd do business with someone
that several people said robbed them?"-
I would check it by myself and not PREjudice the person beforehand. And
yes, i would do business with someone whom "many" people dislike/judge
before he himself proves me he is a fucker (or there was a fair trial).
2. Let an accused child molester be alone with your kids because they were
Sean, he was officially accused, but not convicted or.. you are talking
again about "rumors" and "sayings". If so, i don't give a damn shit about
those sayings.I, myself, not far away from getting this accusation too. And
based on what? Some hallucinations of old grannies with rotten mind?
*I claim that ONE CANNOT JUDGE THE OTHER UNLESS HE WAS PERSONALLY ASSAULTED
BY HIM/HER OR THAT PERSON WAS OFFICIALLY ACCUSED AND CONVICTED* (so yes,
there are very contradictive cases... but at least, this person was
officially accused if not convicted and we can inspect all the documents
and we know who are his accusers. that's the bare fucken *minimum*, not
that there were not thousands of fake cases, especially with women who
revenged their "ex man")
*And Appelbaum? *
You judge him by some fucken rumors - you said that yourself. Exactly like
all the parents of this building judged me by rumors created by old bitch
and are afraid to see kids near me. Not only there was no conviction in a
trial against Appelbaum, but NO EVEN ONE OFFICIAL ACCUSATION from those
"victims" (which is no problem to do, you know, but those fuckers don't
want to do *the bare minimum*, because they are afraid that the lie will
blow up in the police station sooner or later). *So for me, they are
SLANDERS. It's a SMEAR CAMPAIGN. Jake IS innocent. That's it.*
I am saying a fair trial. And not some fucken rumors.
And you are saying "rumors" -> thus Appelbaum/me/you are fucked up.
As i said, it's a way to inquisition trials. Which are based on no true
evidences, but rumors/feelings and in which you are guilty until proven
*And this is the ultimate EVIL.*

@_subject: A Russian Warning 
*A Russian Warning
We, the undersigned, are Russians living and working in the USA. We have
been watching with increasing anxiety as the current US and NATO policies
have set us on an extremely dangerous collision course with the Russian
Federation, as well as with China. Many respected, patriotic Americans,
such as Paul Craig Roberts, Stephen Cohen, Philip Giraldi, Ray McGovern and
many others have been issuing warnings of a looming a Third World War. But
their voices have been all but lost among the din of a mass media that is
full of deceptive and inaccurate stories that characterize the Russian
economy as being in shambles and the Russian military as weakâall based on
no evidence. But weâknowing both Russian history and the current state of
Russian society and the Russian military, cannot swallow these lies. We now
feel that it is our duty, as Russians living in the US, to warn the
American people that they are being lied to, and to tell them the truth.
And the truth is simply this:
*If there is going to be a war with Russia, then the United Stateswill most
certainly be destroyed, and most of us will end up dead.*
Let us take a step back and put what is happening in a historical context.
Russia has suffered a great deal at the hands of foreign invaders, losing
22 million people in World War II. Most of the dead were civilians, because
the country was invaded, and the Russians have vowed to never let such a
disaster happen again. Each time Russia had been invaded, she emerged
victorious. In 1812 Nepoleon invaded Russia; in 1814 Russian cavalry rode
into Paris. On June 22, 1941, Hitlerâs Luftwaffe bombed Kiev; On May 8,
1945, Soviet troops rolled into Berlin.
But times have changed since then. If Hitler were to attack Russia today,
he would be dead 20 to 30 minutes later, his bunker reduced to glowing
rubble by a strike from a Kalibr supersonic cruise missile launched from a
small Russian navy ship somewhere in the Baltic Sea. The operational
abilities of the new Russian military have been most persuasively
demonstrated during the recent action against ISIS, Al Nusra and other
foreign-funded terrorist groups operating in Syria. A long time ago Russia
had to respond to provocations by fighting land battles on her own
territory, then launching a counter-invasion; but this is no longer
necessary. Russiaâs new weapons make retaliation instant, undetectable,
unstoppable and perfectly lethal.
Thus, if tomorrow a war were to break out between the US and Russia, it is
guaranteed that the US would be obliterated. At a minimum, there would no
longer be an electric grid, no internet, no oil and gas pipelines, no
interstate highway system, no air transportation or GPS-based navigation.
Financial centers would lie in ruins. Government at every level would cease
to function. US armed forces, stationed all around the globe, would no
longer be resupplied. At a maximum, the entire landmass of the US would be
covered by a layer of radioactive ash. We tell you this not to be alarmist,
but because, based on everything we know, we are ourselves alarmed. If
attacked, Russia will not back down; she will retaliate, and she will
utterly annihilate the United States.
The US leadership has done everything it could to push the situation to the
brink of disaster. First, its anti-Russian policies have convinced the
Russian leadership that making concessions or negotiating with the West is
futile. It has become apparent that the West will always support any
individual, movement or government that is anti-Russian, be it tax-cheating
Russian oligarchs, convicted Ukrainian war criminals, Saudi-supported
Wahhabi terrorists in Chechnya or cathedral-desecrating punks in Moscow.
Now that NATO, in violation of its previous promises, has expanded right up
to the Russian border, with US forces deployed in the Baltic states, within
artillery range of St. Petersburg, Russiaâs second-largest city, the
Russians have nowhere left to retreat. They will not attack; nor will they
back down or surrender. The Russian leadership enjoys over 80% of popular
support; the remaining 20% seems to feel that it is being too soft in
opposing Western encroachment. But Russia will retaliate, and a provocation
or a simple mistake could trigger a sequence of events that will end with
millions of Americans dead and the US in ruins.
Unlike many Americans, who see war as an exciting, victorious foreign
adventure, the Russians hate and fear war. But they are also ready for it,
and they have been preparing for war for several years now. Their
preparations have been most effective. Unlike the US, which squanders
untold billions on dubious overpriced arms programs such as the F-35 joint
task fighter, the Russians are extremely stingy with their defense rubles,
getting as much as 10 times the bang for the buck compared to the bloated
US defense industry. While it is true that the Russian economy has suffered
from low energy prices, it is far from being in shambles, and a return to
growth is expected as early as next year. Senator John McCain once called
Russia âA gas station masquerading as a country.â Well, he lied. Yes,
Russia is the worldâs largest oil producer and second-largest oil exporter,
but it is also worldâs largest exporter of grain and nuclear power
technology. It is as advanced and sophisticated a society as the United
States. Russiaâs armed forces, both conventional and nuclear, are now ready
to fight, and they are more than a match for the US and NATO, especially if
a war erupts anywhere near the Russian border.
But such a fight would be suicidal for all sides. We strongly believe that
a conventional war in Europe runs a strong chance of turning nuclear very
rapidly, and that any US/NATO nuclear strike on Russian forces or territory
will automatically trigger a retaliatory Russian nuclear strike on the
continental US. Contrary to irresponsible statements made by some American
propagandists, American antiballistic missile systems are incapable of
shielding the American people from a Russian nuclear strike. Russia has the
means to strike at targets in the USA with long-range nuclear as well as
conventional weapons.
The sole reason why the USA and Russia have found themselves on a collision
course, instead of defusing tensions and cooperating on a wide range of
international problems, is the stubborn refusal by the US leadership to
accept Russia as an equal partner: Washington is dead set on being the
âworld leaderâ and the âindispensable nation,â even as its influence
steadily dwindles in the wake of a string of foreign policy and military
disasters such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Yemen and the Ukraine.
Continued American global leadership is something that neither Russia, nor
China, nor most of the other countries are willing to accept. This gradual
but apparent loss of power and influence has caused the US leadership to
become hysterical; and it is but a small step from hysterical to suicidal.
Americaâs political leaders need to be placed under suicide watch.
First and foremost, we are appealing to the commanders of the US Armed
Forces to follow the example of Admiral William Fallon, who, when asked
about a war with Iran, reportedly replied ânot on my watch.â We know that
you are not suicidal, and that you do not wish to die for the sake of
out-of-touch imperial hubris. If possible, please tell your staff,
colleagues and, especially, your civilian superiors that a war with Russia
will not happen on your watch. At the very least, take that pledge
yourselves, and, should the day ever come when the suicidal order is
issued, refuse to execute it on the grounds that it is criminal. Remember
that according to the Nuremberg Tribunal âTo initiate a war of aggressionâ¦
is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime
differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the
accumulated evil of the whole.â Since Nuremberg, âI was just following
ordersâ is no longer a valid defense; please donât be war criminals.
We also appeal to the American people to take peaceful but forceful action
to oppose any politician or party that engages in irresponsible,
provocative Russia-baiting, and that condones and supports a policy of
needless confrontation with a nuclear superpower that is capable of
destroying America in about an hour. Speak up, break through the barrier of
mass media propaganda, and make your fellow Americans aware of the immense
danger of a confrontation between Russia and the US.
There is no objective reason why US and Russia should consider each other
adversaries. The current confrontation is entirely the result of the
extremist views of the neoconservative cult, whose members were allowed to
infiltrate the US Federal government under President Bill Clinton, and who
consider any country that refuses to obey their dictates as an enemy to be
crushed. Thanks to their tireless efforts, over a million innocent people
have already died in the former Yugoslavia, in Afghanistan, in Iraq, Libya,
Syria, Pakistan, the Ukraine, Yemen, Somalia and in many other
countriesâall because of their maniacal insistence that the USA must be a
world empire, not a just a regular, normal country, and that every national
leader must either bow down before them, or be overthrown. In Russia, this
irresistible force has finally encountered an immovable object. They must
be forced to back down before they destroy us all.
We are absolutely and categorically certain that Russia will never attack
the US, nor any EU member state, that Russia is not at all interested in
recreating the USSR, and that there is no âRussian threatâ or âRussian
aggression.â Much of Russiaâs recent economic success has a lot to do with
the shedding of former Soviet dependencies, allowing her to pursue a
âRussia firstâ policy. But we are just as certain that if Russia is
attacked, or even threatened with attack, she will not back down, and that
the Russian leadership will not âblink.â With great sadness and a heavy
heart they will do their sworn duty and unleash a nuclear barrage from
which the United States will never recover. Even if the entire Russian
leadership is killed in a first strike, the so-called âDead Handâ (the
âPerimetrâ system) will automatically launch enough nukes to wipe the USA
off the political map. *We feel that it is our duty to do all we can to
prevent such a catastrophe.*

speaking of in such a manner
Oh, and you are the one who has any idea, right?
You "know for sure" Appelbaum is x/y/z, right? And "you know for sure" that
it's not a smear campaign?
You and many others are just barking like dogs, that's it.
*Was there already an OFFICIAL TRIAL -> and a verdict?!*
*Where are the SOLID and INDISPUTABLE facts* and not some written/said
boolshit about Appelbaum?!
Nothing. Just a lot of mud and wails of slander.
What about the presumption of INNOCENCE, until PRO
VEN otherwise in an official trial?! (not even saying about the fact, that
we've got so many examples of convicting innocent people in a court with
false evidences)
It's the same scheme every time. And most of the people keep eating this

Unambiguous and comprehensive response from Jacob Appelbaum himself to all
this dirty slander toward him!
If this kind of response "does not enough" for you, people, - just go fuck
Jacob Appelbaum Â· 6th Jun 2016 from TwitLonger
Berlin, June 6, 2016
In the past few days, a calculated and targeted attack has been launched to
spread vicious and spurious allegations against me. Given the way these
accusations have been handled, I had little choice but to resign from my
position as an advocate at the Tor Project and devote my full attention to
completing my doctoral work on cryptography at the Technical University of
Vague rumors and smear campaigns against me are nothing new. As a longtime
public advocate for free speech and a secure internet, there have been
plenty of attempts to undermine my work over the years.
Now, however, these unsubstantiated and unfounded attacks have become so
aggressive that I feel itâs necessary to set the record straight. Not only
have I been the target of a fake website in my name that has falsely
accused me of serious crimes, but I have also received death threats
(including a Twitter handle entitled âTimeToDieJakeâ).
I think itâs extremely damaging to the community that these
character-assassination tactics are being deployed, especially given their
ugly history of being used against fellow members of the LGBT community. It
pains me to watch the community to which Iâve dedicated so much of my life
engage in such self-destructive behavior. Nonetheless, I am prepared to use
legal channels, if necessary, to defend my reputation from these libelous
I want to be clear: the accusations of criminal sexual misconduct against
me are entirely false.
Inevitably, there may have been moments in my professional or private life
when I may have inadvertently hurt or offended othersâ feelings. Whenever I
was aware of these instances, I have, and will continue to, apologize to
the friends and colleagues in question and to continually learn how to be a
better person. Though the damage to my reputation caused by these
allegations alone is impossible to undo, I nonetheless take the concerns of
the Tor community seriously. To dispel any further rumors, to the best of
my knowledge, the Tor network is not âcompromised.â
Iâve dedicated my life as a journalist, activist, and longtime member of
the Tor Project to advocating for the transparency of public processes and
to speaking out about the necessity of privacy, security, and anonymity.
These are ideals that I will continue to uphold, despite the vicious
campaign that is currently being waged against me.

yeah. and in the meantime, we will treat Appelbaum as if he IS ALREADY
convicted.... as if he IS ALREADY a serial rapist -> and throw him from his
position = reject him from our community, this way showing everybody our
"neutrality/objectivity" (not talking about showing Appelbaum himself, a
respectful member, some kind of "support", before proven otherwise!)
Yeap, lets show one more time that a man can work all his life to build his

ruin it in one week, by creating an amateur smear campaign with anonymous

really great is going on in your head-heart-soul. DON"T STOP IT! :)
2016-06-12 6:54 GMT+03:00 Kurt Buff :
That's really great, Kurt. But Zenaan is asking WHY don't we
* act*? Why do we live like SLAVES? and WHEN will we start putting great
words (like in the books you listed) *into ACTIONS*?
Knowledge is NOT ONLY about "knowing" it in brain, you know... It's about
incarnating it into actions = into ones physical life!
Even in this cypherpunk list, i believe there are 80% at least, who don't
need more "insights/education of how everything sucks and how one should
(at least try to) repair it".
as Zenaan says in his speech,- *self serving (egoismus) and self delusion*

Capitalism/Darwinism. (Russia -vs- West)
Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution is a book by Peter Kropotkin
Written partly in response to social Darwinism and in particular to Thomas
H. Huxley's Nineteenth Century essay, "The Struggle for Existence",
Kropotkin's book drew on his experiences in scientific expeditions in
Siberia to illustrate the phenomenon of cooperation. After examining the
evidence of cooperation in nonhuman animals, in pre-feudal societies and
medieval cities, and in modern times, he concluded that *cooperation and
mutual aid, and not Darwin's pitiless struggle, are the most important
factors in the evolution of species and the ability to survive.*

*This article is not some amateur propaganda. This is truth, people. I
speak in the name of the vast majority of hundreds of Russian people i
know/knew very well.*
It would never occur to any hero from a Russian epic to sacrifice his life
in exchange for riches.
He did not hesitate to reject the path by which he would âbe rich,â instead
voluntarily taking the road on which he would âbe killed.â
The Russian champion has always gone to war as a liberator, not a
conqueror! And in this we can see the difference between Russians and
Western Europeans.
Humanity in Western Europe is motivated by will and intellect. The Russian
people are above all guided by their hearts and imaginations, relegating
the mind and will to a supporting role.
The Russian people never committed the same atrocities for which the
enlightened Europeans were responsible in their own conquered lands.
Spiritual strength is the basis for Russiansâ renowned forbearance and
tolerance toward others.
Continually invaded from all sides and forced to live in an incredibly
harsh climate, the Russian people managed to colonize vast swathes of land,
but without slaughtering, enslaving, robbing, or forcibly baptizing any
Western Europeansâ policies of colonialism annihilated the aboriginal
populations on three continents and forced natives from across Africa into
slavery, while its cities grew rich on the backs of those colonies.
The Russian nation never treated their conquered subjects as the Europeans
Russia has never been a nationalist state â it has belonged to all who
inhabit her.
Precisely because they have borne so much suffering and heavy sacrifice, my
people deeply empathized with the pain and suffering of other people.
The patriotism displayed by Russian soldiers in the fields of the Great
Patriotic War met the highest ideal of patriotism â something unprecedented
in the history of any nation anywhere in the world. And I will never agree
with the mediaâs pronouncements about Russian âbarbarianismâ vs. European
I stand proud that our ancestors â our heroic ancestors â were so lovely,
steadfast, courageous, and resilient, and that we are their descendants!

You are wrong, my friend. Not religiously and not morally. Russia
human beings. Russians are really different (not "special high race", but
there is something really High and Great in this nation. In the soul of
Russian people).

miss something else... you miss the "why is Zen such a great fun of
Russia/ns/ of this "russkost" thing". it's difficult to express in words...
one should feel it...
it's the Russian real-core DIFFERENCE from other nations, especially from
the Western nations... it's Russians HEARTS. Their SPIRITS. Their high
standards of MORALITY and HEROISM. It's Russians attitude to Good and
Evil...Their humane attitude to other nations....

Also you should understand that this BAN is not a personal decision by "x",

I tried to subscribe to the Tor list (you know, this "anti-censorship"
software list :D). Got a message that i am banned. censored. Like you,
Juan, Zen and a few others. As i already said on the list a few days ago,
what do you expect from scums (calling themselves the backbone of the "tor
community"), that create slander and/or scums who believe in
it at once -> thus BETRAYING Jacob Appelbaum = BETRAYING one of their
Leaders and/or Friends?!
And this betrayal is related to the 90% of the silent cowards of the tor
community too. Those that "aboooove" the mud. Those who write nothing on

b. cowardly sheeple, that never ask nor say inconvenient questions or

lie AND truth //
black AND white //
destroyer AND savior
a few words about the smear campaign against Stalin for the last 70 years.
(information not from your TV/papers/great propaganda bibliographic book):
*Let's Be Honest - Stalin Was Less of a Criminal Than Churchill, Truman,
and LBJ*
"It's time to recover the truth about Stalin and the USSR from a cesspool
of hostile propaganda"
We have long maintained that the truth about the USSR, in general, and
particularly the Stalin period, has long been the object of the most
cynical, mean-spirited, and comprehensive propaganda effort ever seen in
the annals of history.
For reasons of sheer class interest among the plutocrats of the West, the
business elites that still rule most of the so-called âcapitalist
democracies,â the demonization of Stalin was a necessity, a campaign only
briefly interrupted by World War Two and quickly resumed literally a few
hours after its ending.
The Western elites âwith the American ruling circles in the leadâcorrectly
saw an enemy in Stalin. They could not bribe him and they could not
intimidate him. Nor could they easily topple him, as they had done (and
still do) countless times with weaker, âinconvenient leaders.â Whatâs more,
Stalin was at the helm of a powerful nation and titular leader of an
ideology directly opposed to their indispensable economic system.
Occasional diplomacy aside, they hated him. He and his nation stood in the
way of their plans for global hegemony. So the the venom had to flow and
didâabundantly. And in that sordid enterprise the capitalist elites found
countless allies, not to mention the usual battalions of ignorant, useful
As any propaganda student will attest, when vilifying a nationâs policies
and social values, itâs far easier (and effective) if the propagandist aims
the Big Lie machine at its leader. As we have seen in recent times with
Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein, Bashar al-Assad, Fidel Castro, Iran and North
Koreaâs leaders, Venezuelaâs Hugo Chavez, and finally Putinâamong many
others (the empire is never lacking in âdangerous enemiesâ)âthe character
assassination of a leader is an old tactic to prepare the perennially
benighted home population for an attack on the targeted nation.
Truth could swiftly complete the total demonization of Vladimir Putinâa
figure in good standing merely 3 years agoâand not even an avowed
socialist, one can only imagine what outrageous fabrications they could
have concocted (and did) to cordon off the image of Stalin, an outspoken
communist, over several decades. This made eminent sense to the Westâs
doctrinal gatekeepers. Given the identification of Stalinâs long rule with
the Soviet Union at its most embattled, the blackening of Stalinâs name
served an important purpose: it provided the Western propagandists an
invaluable shorthandâan âirrefutable symbolâ of communismâs putative
evilâto block the very idea of genuine socialism as an option for humanity.
The preceding is obviously not to argue that Stalin was a flawless leader,
or a saint who just happened to have a powerful army, or that he didnât
make some serious mistakes. He did. However, the most elementary fairness
demands that we ask, which world historical figure confronted with
enormously difficult choices emerges today (barring self-serving
ideological propaganda) unscathed from close and impartial examination?
Judging Stalin by the context in which he had to act, and even more
important, the purposes he served, he was arguably no worse, morally, than
most Western leaders, and by any rational measure, probably a damn sight
better.  For who are these distinguished gentlemen who have led the West
for over a century now?
Churchill, the most revered member in the club, was an unapologetic racist
and imperialist who in the 1920s endorsed the policy of RAF bombing and
gassing Iraqi villages (Mesopotamia) into submission, for for failure to
pay their assigned tribute. JFK, Lyndon Johnson, and Nixon pursued an
illegitimate, barbaric, genocidal war in Vietnam that remains one of the
horrors of modern imperialism. Truman dropped the bomb on the Japanese as a
way to keep the Soviets âin line,â making America so far the only nation to
have used nuclear weapons on a civilian population. And during the postwar,
the US tentacles, chiefly acting through the CIA and its clients, have
managed to murder and repress tens of millions of people around the
globeâin all latitudes and scores of nations, from the Philippines, to
Indonesia to Chile, to Nicaragua, to Iran, the Congo, Korea, the entire
Middle East, literally bathed in bloodâalways in pursuit of geostrategic
advantage, and the suppression of popular democracy in order to better
permit the continuation and maximization of corporate profit. So much for
the inherent perfidy of communism and angelic innocence of capitalism.
The record is by now so huge and consistent, the hypocrisy so staggering,
that we can state categorically there is not a single case in which America
has used its immense diplomatic and military power to back a genuine
democratic leader (such people are immediately branded âcommunistsâ and
dealt accordingly) or assisted people struggling for freedom from class
oppression. Itâs a vile and hypocritical record that continues to this day,
thanks to the complete brainwash to which the American population has been
subjected as a measure of pre-emptive pacification. The whole thing is
amply documented so thereâs no point in even trying to refute it.
In any case, recovering the truth about Stalin and the USSR from the
cesspool of hostile propaganda in which the enemies of socialism situated
it, assisted by the perennially misguided and often fanatical
anti-communist and especially anti-Stalinist leftists, is no task for the
Thatâs why we salute our colleagues at Russia Insider, and its editor,
Charlie Bausman, in particular, for their decision to publish Grover Furr.
Letting this scholar speak to a larger audience is a badly needed blow for
truth âespecially in the current context of reckless warmongering on
Russiaâs and Chinaâs doorstep. The Big Lie must be defeated if a lasting
peace is ever to be attained by humanity.

@_subject: IBM Quantum Computing 
Well, we have been hearing about this Quantum technology for years... It's
not mature yet, but....
potentially... when it will be mature... it will be able to break any
(oh, maybe it is already mature in the Catacombs of the NSA).
​IBM scientists have built a quantum processor that users can access
through a first-of-a-kind quantum computing platform delivered via the IBM
Cloud  onto any desktop or mobile
device. IBM believes quantum computing is the future of computing and has
the potential to solve certain problems that are impossible to solve on
today’s supercomputers.
The cloud-enabled quantum computing platform, called IBM Quantum Experience
, will allow users to run algorithms
and experiments on IBM’s quantum processor, work with the individual
quantum bits (qubits), and explore tutorials and simulations around what
might be possible with quantum computing.
The quantum processor is composed of five superconducting qubits and is
housed at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in New York. The five-qubit
processor represents the latest advancement in IBM’s quantum architecture
that can scale to larger quantum systems. It is the leading approach
towards building a universal quantum computer
A universal quantum computer can be programmed to perform any computing
task and will be exponentially faster than classical computers for a number
of important applications for science and business.
A universal quantum computer does not exist today, but IBM envisions
medium-sized quantum processors of 50-100 qubits to be possible in the next
decade. With a quantum computer built of just 50 qubits, none of today’s
TOP500 supercomputers could successfully emulate it, reflecting the
tremendous potential of this technology. The community of quantum computer
scientists and theorists is working to harness this power, and applications
in optimization and chemistry will likely be the first to demonstrate
quantum speed-up.
“Quantum computers are very different from today’s computers, not only in
what they look like and are made of, but more importantly in what they can
do. Quantum computing is becoming a reality and it will extend computation
far beyond what is imaginable with today’s computers,” said Arvind Krishna,
senior vice president and director, IBM Research. “This moment represents
the birth of quantum cloud computing. By giving hands-on access to IBM’s
experimental quantum systems, the IBM Quantum Experience will make it
easier for researchers and the scientific community to accelerate
innovations in the quantum field, and help discover new applications for
this technology.”
With Moore’s Law running out of steam, quantum computing will be among the
technologies that could usher in a new era of innovation across industries.
This leap forward in computing could lead to the discovery of new
pharmaceutical drugs and completely safeguard cloud computing systems. It
could also unlock new facets of artificial intelligence (which could lead
to future, more powerful Watson
 technologies), develop
new materials science to transform industries, and search large volumes of big
data .
*IBM Quantum Experience*
Quantum information is very fragile and needs to be protected from any
errors that can result from heat and electromagnetic radiation. Signals are
sent in and out of a cryogenic dilution refrigerator to measure operations
on the quantum processor.
The IBM team has made a number of robust engineering advances both at the
device level and in the electronic controls to give IBM Quantum Experience
users unprecedented and reliably high-quality performance in this
five-qubit processor.
Coupled with software expertise from the IBM Research ecosystem, the team
has built a dynamic user interface on the IBM Cloud
 platform that allows users to easily
connect to the quantum hardware via the cloud. The team sees the
introduction to the public of this complete quantum computing framework as
just the start of a new user community, which embraces the quantum world
and how it works.
In the future, users will have the opportunity to contribute and review
their results in the community hosted on the IBM Quantum Experience and IBM
scientists will be directly engaged to offer more research and insights on
new advances. IBM plans to add more qubits and different processor
arrangements to the IBM Quantum Experience over time, so users can expand
their experiments and help uncover new applications for the technology.
*Quantum computing – a different way of thinking*
We live in a world where classical physics defines our experiences and our
intuition, and ultimately how we process information. However, nature at
the atomic level is governed by a different set of rules known as quantum
mechanics. It is beyond the reach of classical computers to solve problems
that exist in nature in which quantum mechanics plays a role, for example,
understanding how molecules behave.
To overcome this, in 1981, Richard Feynman proposed to build computers
based on the laws of quantum mechanics. Over three decades later, IBM is
helping to make this a reality.
Quantum computing works fundamentally differently from today’s computers. A
classical computer makes use of bits to process information, where each bit
represents either a one or a zero. In contrast, a qubit can represent a
one, a zero, or both at once, which is known as superposition. This
property along with other quantum effects enable quantum computers to
perform certain calculations vastly faster than is possible with classical
Most of today’s quantum computing research in academia and industry is
focused on building a universal quantum computer. The major challenges
include creating qubits of high quality and packaging them together in a
scalable way, so they can perform complex calculations in a controllable
IBM employs superconducting qubits that are made with superconducting
metals on a silicon chip and can be designed and manufactured using
standard silicon fabrication techniques. Last year, IBM scientists
demonstrated critical breakthroughs
 to detect
quantum errors by combining superconducting qubits in latticed
arrangements, and whose quantum circuit design is the only physical
architecture that can scale to larger dimensions.
Now, IBM scientists have achieved a further advance by combining five
qubits in the lattice architecture, which demonstrates a key operation
known as a parity measurement – the basis of many quantum error correction
protocols. The road towards universal quantum computing hinges upon the
achievement of quantum error correction, and the IBM team has taken another
important step down this challenging path.
*New frontiers for quantum computing*
There has been tremendous progress and interest in the field of quantum of
computing in recent years. By giving users access to the IBM Quantum
Experience, it will help businesses and organizations begin to understand
the technology’s potential, for universities to grow their teaching
programs in quantum computing and related subjects, and for students to
become aware of promising new career paths.
“It is a beautiful challenge to pursue the path to build the first
universal quantum computer, but it requires us to change how we think about
the world. Access to early quantum computing prototypes will be key in
imagining and developing future applications,” said Dario Gil, vice
president of science and solutions, IBM Research. “If you want to
understand what a true quantum computer will do for you and how it works,
this is the place to do it. You won’t experience it anywhere else.”
IBM’s quantum computing platform is a core initiative within the newly
formed IBM Research Frontiers Institute . The
Frontiers Institute is a consortium that develops and shares
ground-breaking computing technologies to spur world-changing innovations.
Companies from diverse industries can leverage IBM’s research talent and
cutting-edge infrastructure to explore what the future of quantum computing
may mean for their organization and business. Founding members of the
Frontiers Institute include Samsung, JSR, and Honda.

@_subject: Telephone metadata can reveal surprisingly sensitive personal 
Stanford computer scientists show telephone metadata can reveal
surprisingly sensitive personal information
Stanford researchers show that telephone metadata – information about calls
and text messages, such as time and length – can alone reveal a surprising
amount of personal detail. The work could help inform future policies for
government surveillance and consumer data privacy.
Most people might not give telephone metadata – the numbers you dial, the
length of your calls – a second thought. Some government officials probably
view it as similarly trivial, which is why this information can be obtained
without a warrant.

Agency shows that warrantless surveillance can reveal a surprising amount
of personal information about individual Americans. (Image credit: Sergey

But a new analysis
by Stanford computer scientists shows that it is possible to identify a
person’s private information – such as health details – from metadata
alone. Additionally, following metadata “hops” from one person’s
communications can involve thousands of other people.
The researchers set out to fill knowledge gaps within the National Security
Agency’s current phone metadata program, which has drawn conflicting
assertions about its privacy impacts. The law currently treats call content
and metadata separately and makes it easier for government agencies to
obtain metadata, in part because it assumes that it shouldn’t be possible
to infer specific sensitive details about people based on metadata alone.
The findings, reported today in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences*, provide the first empirical data on the privacy properties of
telephone metadata. Preliminary versions of the work, previously made
available online, have already played a role in federal surveillance policy
and have been cited in litigation filings and letters to legislators in
both the United States and abroad. The final work could be used to help
make more informed policy decisions about government surveillance and
consumer data privacy.
The computer scientists built a smartphone application that retrieved the
previous call and text message metadata – the numbers, times and lengths of
communications – from more than 800 volunteers’ smartphone logs. In total,
participants provided records of more than 250,000 calls and 1.2 million
texts. The researchers then used a combination of inexpensive automated and
manual processes to illustrate both the extent of the reach – how many
people would be involved in a scan of a single person – and the level of
sensitive information that can be gleaned about each user.
infer, for instance, that a person who placed several calls to a
cardiologist, a local drugstore and a cardiac arrhythmia monitoring device
hotline likely suffers from cardiac arrhythmia. Another study participant
likely owns an AR semiautomatic rifle, based on frequent calls to a local
firearms dealer that prominently advertises AR semiautomatic rifles and to
the customer support hotline of a major firearm manufacturer that produces
these rifles.
One of the government’s justifications for allowing law enforcement and
national security agencies to access metadata without warrants is the
underlying belief that it’s not sensitive information. This work shows that
assumption is not true.
“I was somewhat surprised by how successfully we inferred sensitive details
about individuals,” said study co-author Patrick Mutchler, a graduate
student at Stanford. “It feels intuitive that the businesses you call say
something about yourself. But when you look at how effectively we were able
to identify that a person likely had a medical condition, which we consider
intensely private, that was interesting.”
They also found that a large number of people could get caught up in a
single surveillance sweep. When the National Security Agency examines
metadata associated with a suspect’s phone, it is allowed to examine a
“two-hop” net around the suspect. Suspect A calls person B is one hop;
person B calls person C is the second hop. Analysts can then comb the
metadata of anyone within two hops of the suspect.
By extrapolating participant data, the researchers estimated that the NSA’s
current authorities could allow for surveilling roughly 25,000 individuals
– and possibly more – starting from just one “seed” phone user.
Although the results are not surprising, the researchers said that the raw,
empirical data provide a better-informed starting point for future
conversations between privacy interest groups and policymakers.
For instance, the authors point to the recent shift to reduce the metadata
retrieval window from five years to 18 months. By drawing accurate
and sensitive inferences about participants from roughly six months-worth
of calls and texts, the study suggests that metadata are more revealing
than previously thought.
Similarly, the government’s two-hop call sweep was previously three hops;
that reduction was implemented to reduce the number of people caught in a
sweep. Shortening the time window could reduce that number further,
Mutchler said.
“If we’re going to pick a sweet spot as society, where we want the privacy
vs. security tradeoff to lie, it’s important to understand the implications
of the polices that we have,” Mutchler said. “In this paper, we have
empirical data, which I think will help people make informed decisions.”
The study, “Evaluating the privacy properties of telephone metadata,” was
coauthored by John C. Mitchell ,
the Mary and Gordon Crary Family Professor in the School of Engineering,
and Jonathan Mayer, a scholar in the Stanford School of Engineering and the
Stanford Law School. Mayer is currently detailed from Stanford to the
Federal Communications Commission, where he is serving as Chief
Technologist for the Enforcement Bureau. The project was supported in part
by the National Science Foundation Team for Research in Ubiquitous Secure
Technology Research Center.

@_subject: All your disk image are (forever) belong to us, says appeals court 
*All your disk image are belong to us, says appeals courtCourt says your
files are ripe for seizure—Fourth Amendment doesn't apply.*
*by David Kravets - May 31, 2016*
The government can prosecute and imprison people for crimes based on
evidence obtained from their computers—even evidence retained for years
that was outside the scope of an original probable-cause search warrant, a
US federal appeals court has said in a 100-page opinion paired with a
blistering dissent.
The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
that there was no constitutional violation because the authorities acted in
good faith when they initially obtained a search warrant, held on to the
files for years, and built a case unrelated to the original search.
The case posed a vexing question—how long may the authorities keep
somebody's computer files that were obtained during a search but were not
germane to that search? The convicted accountant said that only the
computer files pertaining to his client—who was being investigated as part
of an Army overbilling scandal—should have been retained by the government
during a 2003 search. All of his personal files, which eventually led to
his own tax-evasion conviction, should have been purged, he argued.
But the appeals court said the authorities' behavior was acceptable and
didn't reach the constitutional question of whether the Fourth Amendment
rights were breached for accountant Stavros Ganias, who was sentenced to
two years in prison. That's because three years after the original search
of the accountant's files in connection to the Army scandal, Connecticut
authorities got another search warrant for Ganias' own tax files that were
already in the government's possession, the appeals court ruled in a 12-1
decision Friday written by Judges Debra Ann Livingston and Gerard Lynch.
Ganias had subsequently deleted those files from his hard drives after the
government had imaged them, according to court records:
Defendant-Appellant Stavros Ganias appeals from a judgment of the United
*The case is clearly nuanced, but it has huge ramifications for the public
because many people keep all of their papers and effects co-mingled on
their hard drives.*
In his 40-page dissent, Judge Denny Chin blasted the majority opinion and
said the authorities wrongly seized files from Ganias that were unrelated
to the Army overbilling investigation. "The government did precisely what
the Fourth Amendment forbids: it entered Ganias' premises with a warrant to
seize certain papers and indiscriminately seized—and retained—all papers
instead," Chin wrote.
This is not the first time the appeals court entertained the case. Last
year, the court sided
(PDF) with Ganias in a 2-1 ruling. But the government asked for the full
appeals court to rehear the case en banc, and the court agreed to do so
with all 13 judges. The court's original ruling for Ganias said
investigators had a right to image Ganias' three hard drives at the center
of the Army overbilling dispute. But the majority concluded that the law
did not allow "officials executing a warrant for the seizure of particular
data on a computer to seize and indefinitely retain every file on a
computer for use in future criminal proceedings."
Ganias' lawyer, Stanley Twardy, urged the government to set aside his
client's conviction.
*"The seizure and two-and-a-half year retention of every file on Ganias'
computers violated the Fourth Amendment,"* Twardy
wrote .
(PDF) He told the New York-based appeals court that "at a minimum the
Fourth Amendment requires prompt completion of an off-site review and
return of files outside the warrant's scope."
The government countered, "Consistent with the Fourth Amendment, the
government may obtain a search warrant for nearly any person, place, or
thing if the government establishes probable cause for the search and did
not engage in an illegal seizure of the item to be searched," Assistant US
Attorney Sandra Glover wrote in the government's
