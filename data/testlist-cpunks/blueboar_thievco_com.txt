catches arrest on tape
Video on front page here:
If you're curious, like me.
Now... why would I need the police's permission to film myself being
arrested in my house?
Everyone was extraordinarily reasonable during the whole arrest, as
shown in the video.  Why should the police have a problem?
So much for private cams and police cams having equal protection.
