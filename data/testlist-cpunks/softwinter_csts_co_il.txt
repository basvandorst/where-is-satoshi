@_subject: Ann:On the fly disk encryption for Windows NT 
Shade - First software package to provide on the fly disk encryption for Windows NT
Shade allows you to create encrypted disk device inside a file.
Such a device can then be formatted using any file system
(like NTFS or FAT) and used as a regular disk. The only difference
is that Shade will encrypt the data on every write operation
and decrypt it on every read operation.
