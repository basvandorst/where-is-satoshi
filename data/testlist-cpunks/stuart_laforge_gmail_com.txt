No. You are wrong. The world has changed forever. Bitcoin was a technological djinni like the nuke. Now that it has been loosed in the world. All the kings horses and all the kings men cannot get bitcoin back into the bottle again. But you are also right: the king is forced into the game now so he is both vulnerable and dangerous.
Yeah. That Steve Jobs guy had lots of gold. Too bad he didn't make any rules against cancer with all that gold. What's with this rant anyway?   Did you lose money? Did you get robbed while slumming in the hood? I just don't understand how you could be upset that spending money made you more wealthy friends than it did poor friends. My problem is the exact opposite. I would be happy to be your poor friend if that's all you want. Or is this perhaps you declaring your side in the class war or There are *lots* of reason why people are what they are. A lot of your angst stems from thinking too *much*. About what was and what could be rather than opening yourself up to the present moment in all its glory. Lighten up. Enjoy your new found wealth.  the dying of the light. Are you giving up?
