@_subject: private vs. public tor network ... any other options ? 
We run a private Tor-based network.  Email Steve (sms or I for questions.
What we have contemplated is operating the exit nodes, and mixing into the public Tor network for either the middle or both middle and entry nodes.  You could select high bandwidth middle-nodes for this, which would give you reasonably high performance, yet you would have 1-2-or more public nodes in between the user and the exit node.  This would provide increased anonymity, while preserving performance and security of the exit nodes (protecting against mal-nodes).
The thought was also to select those middle nodes based on measured performance.
