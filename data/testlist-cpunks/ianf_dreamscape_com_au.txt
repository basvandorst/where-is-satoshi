I've heard comments about using laser scribes (ie. the types which used to be used to program fuse links on nonce-style "serial number" registers) being used to totally disconnect and/or destroy BIST circuitry from the rest of the chip in "sensitive" devices.
Of course, this wouldn't prevent a microprobing attack, but it certainly makes sure the security fuse hasn't been forgotten.
