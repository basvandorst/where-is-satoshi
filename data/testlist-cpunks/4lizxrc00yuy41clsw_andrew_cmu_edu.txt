Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 9-Jun-96 Gore's speech writers by
Timothy C. May at got.net I've been a fan of Helprin's short stories for a number of years -- he
is a beautiful writer and talented wordsmith. Helprin can make a
paragraph get up, get down, and do the fandango.
If anything is going to give Dole a competitive edge during this
campaign, it's Mark Helprin.
