@_subject: REMAIL: pseudo-account remailer @andrew gains anonymous feature 
I added an anonymous feature to my remailer.
If you have an address of the form mg5n+eaxxx at andrew.cmu.edu,
anonymous mail can be sent to that address by changing it to the format:
mg5n+anxxx at andrew.cmu.edu
An encrypted reply address is created for the sender of the anonymous message.
You can get an anonymous address by sending mail to mg5n+getid at andrew.cmu.edu
P.S. For what it's worth, the address
mg5n+anz3ajg8o1yxicqzt6v6qgpg3tkhddpqw3jl at andrew.cmu.edu
will forward anonymously to cypherpunks at toad.com.  If your mail software
supports mail aliases, a mail alias to that address might be an easy way
to post anon to the list (and get replies ;-)
As before, anyone who wants the source is welcome to it, however there
is nil documentation, and some of my recent hacks to it have increased
the code sloppiness factor by several orders of magnitude.  It does now
support 3DES encryption, much thanks to Phil Karn and Jim Gillogly's PD
