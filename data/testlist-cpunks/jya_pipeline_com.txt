Responding to msg by a.brown at nexor.co.uk (Andrew Brown) on Wed, 3 Aug  1:17 PM
Features for concealment of plain or cyphertext by CAD 1.  Plain or cyphertext can be imported by each letter, by sentence, by block of text; then manipulated by the CAD program as one or multiple concealed CAD entities.
2.  Text manipulation includes:
    Reduce to any scale.
    Place on hidden layers.
    Hide by other entities.
    Distort to a variety of shapes.
    And otherwise disfigure the text into non-recognizable 3.  In addition, there are a host of CAD-features for further, multiple, transformations of the text, including algorithmic 4.  Subsequent manipulation of the CAD document may include exporting to other proprietary and generic CAD formats.
5.  CAD document may then be transmitted plain (in the selected CAD format) or encrypted for transmission.
6.  The recipient uses a CAD program (and decryption program if needed) to restore the concealed text to its original encrypted form.  It is exported to the original encryption program for decryption. 7.  Caveat 1:  While this manipulation will be invisible or camouflaged in the CAD document the underlying code of the program will provide clues.  However, it should be possible to encrypt these clues.
8.  Caveat 2:  Sender and recipient will need to exchange protocols, by encrypted transmission probably, for restoring the concealed text.
9.  Caveat 3:  This is not elegant and requires little or no crypto competency.  But it can be easily done by a CAD operator to help conceal sophisticated crypto.

The list Cyberia posted an article yesterday on the US Postal Service's plan to use a public key system for email. If anyone wants the full posting, email me; it's about 25K.
Below are excerpts:
Quebec City, Canada, August 3, 1994--The U.S. Postal Service dramatically increased its commitment to the security of
communications on the NII, with the announcement of Postal
Electronic Commerce Services ("Postal ECS"), which will offer a
nationwide public key certification service for the of digital signatures used in paperless electronic commerce.   Richard Rothwell, Senior Director of Technology Integration for USPS, officially released the news today in Quebec City, in a delivered to an international working group of the Information
Security Committee of the American Bar Association's Section of
Science and Technology, which has been developing guidelines public key certification authorities. [Speech is all in uppercase]
* * *
AS MANY EXPERTS HAVE NOTED, INCLUDING MANY OF YOU IN THIS
ROOM, DIGITAL FILES AS A RULE ARE NEITHER AS SECURE NOR AS
ELECTRONIC COMMERCE CONVEYS.  BUT WITHOUT SOME METHOD OF A DIGITAL FILE TO ESTABLISH ITS CONTENTS, AUTHOR, AND TIME OF
TRANSMITTAL, THE BENEFITS OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE WILL BE LIMITED TO HIGHLY STRUCTURED TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN PARTIES KNOW AND TRUST ONE ANOTHER.
* * *
THE POSTAL SERVICE IS USING PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY, RELATED TECHNOLOGIES, TO DEVELOP A PUBLIC KEY CERTIFICATION
AUTHORITY AND A SET OF ASSOCIATED TRUSTED THIRD PARTY SERVICES
WHICH WE CALL POSTAL ELECTRONIC COMMERCE SERVICES (POSTAL ECS). WHEN INITIALLY DEPLOYED, POSTAL ECS WILL PROVIDE A BASIS FOR
ELECTRONIC ASSURANCES WITHIN AND AMONG GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND
BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS.  IN
PARTICULAR, THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS DEVELOPED THE ABILITY TO:
         ISSUE PUBLIC KEY CERTIFICATES AND STORE THEM IN A
          PUBLIC DIRECTORY;          PROVIDE FOR THE "SEALING" OF SELECTED DOCUMENTS OR
          OTHER ELECTRONIC OBJECTS AND ASSOCIATING THEM WITH A
          DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND A TRUSTED TIME AND DATE STAMP;
         PROVIDE SERVICES FOR PUBLIC KEY CERTIFICATE           AND REVOCATION; AND,          PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO ENCRYPT CONFIDENTIAL           MOVING BETWEEN THE USER ENVIRONMENT AND THE POSTAL           MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
         FINALLY, PROVIDE NEAR REAL-TIME ACCESS TO           AND THEIR STATUS.
THE CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY WILL ISSUE AND MANAGE X.509 PUBLIC
KEY CERTIFICATES CONTAINING A PERSON'S X.500 DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC KEY, AND OTHER IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.  USERS CAN THEN
RETRIEVE A CERTIFICATE FROM THE POSTAL SERVICE, AND USE ITS
PUBLIC KEY TO AUTHENTICATE A DIGITAL SIGNATURE GENERATED BY THE
COMPLEMENTARY PRIVATE KEY.  * * *
THESE USER AGENTS CONTAIN STANDARD PROGRAMMING INTERFACES THAT
LINK USER APPLICATIONS, CRYPTOGRAPHIC ROUTINES, AND ECS TOGETHER.  OUR INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION IS BASED ON THE DIGITAL
SIGNATURE STANDARD (DSS) ALGORITHM SET; BUT OUR PLAN IS TO
SUPPORT OTHER CRYPTOGRAPHIC OPTIONS SUCH AS RSA IN THE NEAR
FUTURE. * * *
IN KEEPING WITH THE PHILOSOPHY I HAVE ARTICULATED, LET ME SAY
THAT THE POSTAL SERVICE, IN ANY DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PRODUCTS,
INTENDS TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE CRYPTOGRAPHIC PRODUCTS IN THE PLACE.  IN ADDITION, WE WILL NOT COMPETE WITH NETWORK SERVICE
PROVIDERS, NOR WILL WE BECOME A NETWORK OR CARRIER.

Thanks for posting your thoughts on this.
A small note:  The NY Times article today said that NSA will contribute $4.2 million toward *development*, along with $400,000 in software-consulting services, while Cray will invest another $4.8 million.  Thus the overall cost, after full development, may be more than you assumed in your calculations and thus the power may be more.
But, as the story said, Cray will need more than this initial contract to survive, so the machine may never be completed.

Bill's suggestion about obscurity through strong crypto as a defense against real bullets is a provocative version of "the pen is mightier than the sword" homily.
That rephrasing of the topic seems to be a good way to mix software and hardware issues that originated the "they" topic.
Is it possible for mind stuff and its gadgets to beat the tools of physical violence?  It seems that is what this list is Jim Dixon's elegant disquisition (and that of other respondents) on the rise and fall of governments is less persuasive than his (and others') remarks, say, on the NSA spy machine where he (and they) shows nitty-gritty expertise.
I vote for the nit-grit as more pertinent to Hal's "real bullets" problem.  Sorry, but geo-political bullshit apologizes for real killers of all political bent, in power or out.
Geo-pol is overdone by talking heads who sound numbingly alike.  The distincitive sound of crypto and techno stuff is what charms here, because it's rarely heard in public venues.

2.  Who is in the offing to succeed Cray and others as NSA's grateful suppliers?
3.  Will there be more on-base hardware and software production, a "circling of the wagons" as crypto becomes more 4.  And, thus, an even sharper (and more secret and competitive) line between governmental and commercial crypto hardware and code?
5.  Who is NSA (or other TLAs) underwriting as lesser known SRCs, not-for- or for-profit?  This is an update on where the jobs are for the "finest mathematicians" other than TLAs.
6.  Is NSA (like CIA and NRO) bifurcating into an even more super-supersecret arm and another friendly, public one in response to wider use of crypto and ostensible pressure from the likes of Senators Moynihan and Kerrey?  (And the recent RSA to-dos, murder threat, PKP lawsuit, are ploys.)

Hey, that's what commercializing the national security treasure is all about.
Ignorance is essential for the market in nuclear "terrorism".  The staid NY Times headlined a summary of this topic with "Call 1-800-TERROR".  The unknown threat is the weapon.  Intelligence is the magic shield.
The National Resources Defense Council pointed out in an execellent series on nuclear weapons a few years back that it is impossible to make an accurate count of nuclear devices because every country dissembles even while leaking data to sow fear.  Even now, says NRDC, the need is for a reliable way to count so the fictitious can be separated from the real.
Lack of precision, ignorance, thank you Perry, helps market fake as well as real nuclear material, just like any other market-driven exotic product (supercomputers?).  Recent reports describe the Russian nuclear materials managers proffering their real and Potemkin cache for buy-out to the most gullible deep-pockets, governments.
And so goes pumping this lucrative market, and its concomitant market of intelligence, now commercial where once affairs of state.  More national security legislation, more powerful computers, more money for salesmen (er, agents).
Ignorance drives this market, always has; starting some forty years ago with George Kennan's lurid 'X' essay on containment.  Jim Dixon, help out with gritty facts.

Perhaps.  However, there is much detailed design and production info in the "Nuclear Weapons Databook" series:

The series provides pretty detailed textual and graphic descriptions of the entire history of design, production, testing and deployment of nuclear weapons. These are written by the folks at Natural Resources Defense Council and are available there and from Ballinger Division, Harper and Row, New York.
The beloved McGeorge Bundy is quoted on the covers:

To tie this back to crypto and technology:
Under a sub-sub-sub-contract I once worked on some phony CAD drawings for the nuclear weapons production process, plotting false info that still appears in popular books, some of which has been posted here.
The docs were then encrypted and stegonagraphied for authenticity.  We were told that they were turned loose on the market for this product in other countries.

Responding to msg by nobody at ds1.wu-wien.ac.at () on Sun, 28 Aug  2:32 AM
Out of your several thoughful comments this one strikes some Terror of nuclear weapons is universal.  Nothing about crypto anarchy is terrifying (yet).
A link between the two is not fanciful because of the challenge to those who hold secrets posed by crypto anarchy.
One singularity of the nuclear arsenal was that few people actually know its capability.  Its secrecy is a part of the threat.  The same is true of the more general national security apparatus, most of whose power derives from privileged knowledge of weapon-systems capabilities.
By extension of state power, under the rubric of national security, to other areas of government, often under the guise of intelligence and law enforcement needs, we have a society where a small number of economic, scientific, political, military and law enforcement persons hold privileged secrets and a very large citizenry who does not.  Because of suspected abuse of privilege, these keepers of secrets are no longer Electoral politics, once thought to offer means to throw the scoundrels out, now feeds this suspicion, rather than relieving it,  because little of entrenched power structures are changed by the voting process.  The public process merely cosmetizes the means for exploiting the the secret privileges of the few.
The crypto and related technological and civil issues discussed on this list might be viewed as exploring how to redirect the science and technology, heretofore used sustain a national security-driven economy, toward creating the apparatus for a more just and benefical civil society, one less fraught with military, police and economic insecurity and fear of the tools of privileged secrecy.
Mastering cryptography and devising ways to put it to remunerative use are honorable and constructive alternatives to enduring unresponsive government.  If successful they will set examples, and provide tools,  for others to diminish state However, there is still the task of proving that crypto anarchy is not itself a play for power by those who write and master its cryptographic code.  But better to test that in the public arena rather remain hidden and protected by state secrecy.
Fierce opposition should be expected, not least by demonizing crypto anarchy.  It will probably begin within the crypto anarchy enterprise under the guise of skeptical criticism and provocative baiting.
It is worth recalling that classical black anarchy, the secret, lethal version as distinguished from open black flag type, is used by despots to justify their ruthless measures.  Black anarchists, as agents of despots,  mingle with avowed flag-wavers to spy and provoke acts that lead to repressive crackdowns.  Black anarchists never announce themselves as such but may freely admit to being "anarchistic" as a wild-eyed subterfuge.  Inept provocations sometimes reveal them but the most able are never detected.

"And flirting with heresy, Mr. Spindler says he sees no need for the so-called information superhighway.  And 500 channels?  Sixty are plenty.  'This is not going to be an all-electronic world where we all sit on a couch and are force-fed a constant stream of information,' said Mr. Sindler."
"Mr. Spindler took pains to contrast himself with two of his industry's rivals -- and vaunted visionaries -- William H. Gates, chairman of Microsoft, and Andrew S. Grove, chairman of Intel.  'They believe that just because of technospeak it's going to happen, but it's not,' said Mr. Spindler."
"And yet, Mr. Spindler, even as he decries the industry's preoccupation with the so-called vision thing, acknowledges that there are still ways of improving the life of the computer user.  'We still have to switch our computers on and off,' he said.  'We go to the restroom, and when we leave it flushes automatically.' "

@_subject: NYT on Insecure Phones 
The New York Times last Thursday had two pieces on
   telephones that may be of interest.
   One deals with cellular fraud in NYC, given entirely here:
   "Cellular Fraud in New York
         Cellular telephone fraud in New York City has become    rampant that a cellular service in Washington will
   temporarily block its customers from using their wireless
   phones when they travel in New York.
         Cellular One of Washington-Baltimore, owned by SBC
   Communications Inc., has sent its customers letters
   notifying them that it would block the service beginning on
   Thursday because it had compiled a huge backlog of phone
   numbers used in New York that appeared to be fraudulent.
         Company officials said they would resume service once
   they finished investigating each case, which they said
   would take three weeks.
         Cellular telephone fraud occurs when people use false
   identification numbers on their wireless telephones and
   make calls. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry
   Association said fraud costs had soared to about $1 billion
   a year.
         Cellular thieves typically use radio scanners to    the identification numbers of legitimate cellular phones,
   which transmit the numbers each time they are used. These
   numbers are then written onto a computer chip inside an
   inactive phone, effectively 'cloning' the original."
   -------------------
   End illegitimate fraud article
   Then, probably not coincidentally in this happy
   legitimate-fraud shopping season, there was a long
   consumer-oriented article the very same day, alors, about
   new cordless phones, including this info about security
   features against illegitimate fraud:
   "A new generation of digital cordless phones using a
   powerful 900 megahertz (MHz) frequency ... blocks thieves
   who scan the airwaves listening for credit card and Social
   Security numbers people innocently give over the phone. ...
   Cellular car phones and two-way radio car service
   conversations were constant unwanted companions with the
   standard cordless phones [but] with the 900 MHz phones, the
   interference was practically non-existent. ...
   The Cincinnati Microwave Escort 9020 Digital Spread
   Spectrum Cordless Telephone is one of the first models to
   feature spread-spectrum technology -- originally developed
   for the military and now being used for consumers -- that
   digitally scrambles voice communications before
   transmitting them. ...
   ... newer standard-frequency models are offering improved
   security.  By using scrambling technology -- though not as
   sophisticated as digital spread spectrum -- they block out
   most eavesdroppers.  Panasonic calls the feature Secure
   Guard; Motorola, Secure Clear, and Toshiba, Call Protect.    It doesn't add much to the cost ($10 to $25) and is well
   worth the money, although the phone is not as secure as a
   digital one."

And, while not directly related to crypto, the magazine "The Sciences", published by the New York Academy of Sciences, has a long article, "Beyond E=mc(2)", on a controversial theory that mass is "only electric charge and energy".
The authors are:  Bernard Haisch, Alfonso Rueda and H. E. For copy send blank message with subject:  EMC2_too
Here is a brief excerpt:
   Recent work by us and others now appears to offer a
   radically different insight into the relation E=mc(2), as
   well as into the very idea of mass itself. To put it
   simply, the concept of mass may be neither fundamental nor
   necessary in physics. In the view we will present,
   Einstein's formula is even more significant than physicists
   have realized. It is actually a statement about how much
   energy is required to give the appearance of a certain
   amount of mass, rather than about the conversion of one
   fundamental thing, energy, into another fundamental thing,
   mass.
   Indeed, if that view is correct, there is no such thing as
   mass -- only electric charge and energy, which together
   create the illusion of mass. The physical universe is made
   up of massless electric charges immersed in a vast,
   energetic, all-pervasive electromagnetic field. It is the
   interaction of those charges and the electromagnetic field
   that creates the appearance of mass. In other words, the
   magazine you now hold in your hands is massless; properly
   understood, it is physically nothing more than a collection
   of electric charges embedded in a universal energetic
   electromagnetic field and acted on by the field in such a
   way as to make you think the magazine has the property of
   mass. Its apparent weight and solidity arise from the
   interactions of charges and field.
   Besides recasting the prevailing view of mass, this idea
   would address one of the most profound problems of physics,
   the riddle of how gravity can be unified with the other
   three fundamental forces of nature. The electromagnetic
   force and the weak force, which is responsible for nuclear
   decay, have been shown to be two manifestations of a single
   force, appropriately called the electroweak force. There
   are tantalizing hints that the strong force, which binds
   nuclei together, will someday be unified with the
   electroweak force. But until now gravity has resisted all
   attempts at unification. If the new view is correct,
   however, gravity would not need to be separately unified.
   Just as mass would arise from the electromagnetic force, so
   would gravity.

For email copy send blank message with subject:  585_999
Here are few excerpts:
   In recent weeks, evoking memories of Richard Nixon at the
   height of the Watergate crisis, Mr. Grove has retreated to
   his "war room" inside the company's corporate headquarters
   in Santa Clara.
   ***
   'Righteousness'
   How did a sporadic arithmetic error that was not detected
   for months, in the chip that Intel insists is its most
   heavily tested microprocessor in history, become the heart
   of such a debacle?
   The answer is rooted in Intel's distinctive corporate
   culture, and suggests that Intel went wrong in much the
   same way as other big and unresponsive companies before it.
   Intel has traditionally valued engineering over product
   marketing. Inward-looking and wary of competitors (from
   experience with the Japanese), it developed a bunker
   mentality, a go-for-the-jugular attitude and a reputation
   for arrogance.
   "There are certain elements in Intel's culture, and one is
   righteousness," said Federico Faggin, a former Intel
   engineer and co-inventor of its first microprocessor.
   "The attitude at Intel is, 'We're better than everyone else
   and what we do is right and we never make mistakes.' "
   ***
   But the technologist's mind-set did little to prepare Intel
   for the consumer marketplace. Although it spent hundreds of
   millions of dollars on its "Intel Inside" and Pentium ad
   campaigns, the consumer-oriented strategy unraveled last
   month when Mr. Grove dismissed customers' requests for
   chips to replace the Pentium.
   ***
   "What Intel clearly should have done is issued a bug report
   as soon as they found out it was a reproducible problem,"
   said Timothy May, a former Intel semiconductor engineer.
   "Instead, by keeping it mum, they backed themselves into a
   corner."
   But although he has issued a public apology for the flaw,
   Mr. Grove has been unwilling to personally come forward in
   an effort to restore customer confidence.
   "The test of a great company is in how they handle
   disasters," said James F. Moore, head of Geopartners, a
   high-tech consulting firm. "This is one where you can't
   behave like a paranoid. This is one where only the
   compassionate survive."

Some tidbits:
   New Shot at Cold Fusion
   By Pumping Sound Waves
   Into Tiny Bubbles
   [Drawing caption]
   New Fusion Recipe:  Sound Plus Bubbles
   Fusion creates great energy but requires tremendous
   temperatures. In a new approach that scientists hope might
   reach such temperatures, they are using minuscule bubbles
   as the focus for sound waves. In this figure, a tiny
   heating element boils just enough water to create a single
   micron-sized bubble. A sound field makes the bubble
   pulsate. As it expands, it absorbs sound energy. Then it
   violently collapses, launching a spherical, inward-moving
   supersonic shock wave, which produces enormous temperatures
   and a flash of light.
   By Malcolm W. Browne
   Ever since the first hydrogen bomb was detonated in 1952,
   scientists have sought to harness thermonuclear fusion as
   a peaceful power source, but that goal has proved
   tantalizingly elusive. Now, however, there seems to be an
   outside chance that a wholly new technique could achieve
   it. Bombarding microscopic bubbles with intense sound waves
   could convert the bubbles into minuscule fusion furnaces.
   Recent experiments by a half-dozen laboratories suggest
   that a mysterious phenomenon called sonoluminescence may be
   capable of raising the temperature of gas trapped in a tiny
   bubble to 1.8 million degrees Fahrenheit or more -- enough,
   in principle, to ignite fusion.
   If fusion were achieved, a microbubble could be expected to
   radiate neutrons, nuclear particles produced by
   thermonuclear reactions. So far, the laboratories
   experimenting with sonoluminescence have failed to detected
   any neutrons, but there are other signs that the project is
   far from hopeless.
   ***
   Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California, the nation's
   preeminent hydrogen bomb laboratory, has conducted some
   small experiments on "sonofusion," the name that would be
   bestowed on any fusion technique powered by sonoluminescent
   bubbles.
    As part of its nuclear weapons research programs during the
   1980's, Livermore built the Nova laser, which focuses
   multiple beams of ultrapowerful lasers from all directions
   on a small target. Among the targets Livermore has tested
   are tiny, hollow glass spheres filled with hydrogen
   isotopes. In a typical experiment, the laser beams are
   turned on, the glass instantly vaporizes and the resulting
   shock wave of glass vapor is driven inward to compress the
   hydrogen. The idea is to get the hydrogen hot enough to
   initiate fusion.
   ***
   Still, the nation's thermonuclear bomb designers eventually
   solved similar problems for full-scale hydrogen bombs, and
   Livermore's scientists believe that inertial confinement
   fusion as a means of generating comparatively cheap
   electric power will eventually prove to be practical.
   The tiny bubbles used in sonoluminescence experiments are
   similar in terms of their fusion physics to their big
   brothers, hydrogen bombs and on a smaller scale, to the
   glass spheres used in inertial confinement fusion.

Peter Lewis wrote yesterday about the LaMacchia case dismissal.  The article was reprinted verbatim today.  It too focussed on the need for legislation.  (Todd posted Reuter's version.)
Is it any wonder that lawyers are quoted when enhanced law and order are immanent?  Mike Godwin, of EFF and also a Cyberia-L subscriber, takes a dissenting view from that presented by those quoted by Lewis.  Or so I would judge from his posts on the LaMacchia case.
My one-cent's worth to the anonymity topic is that The NYT may be drum-beating for legislation to regulate anonymity -- a characteristicly paternalistic role of the self-important power-brokering running-dog mad-dog yellow-dog hyenia-slobbering anarchy-hating media.

I like your original notion of card-playing as a way to build a taste for crypto by non-cryptoids (like me).
It parallels political and economic chance and the use of crypto to hide info from foes and competitors.
Putting crypto into public play like this will help teach protection from economic security mongers and toadies.

I would say that an algorithm is also a rigidly constructed framework consisting of well-defined formula within a stabilized potential well; as such it has limited operability in situations which possess fuzzy heuristics - such situations would include ordinary-language parsing, by the way, if a theoretical full-accountability is to be given. Eliminating indeterminacy and `true randomness' is eliminating the lifeworld itself, with its fuzzy heuristics not always reducible to natural law, even of the trajectory-bundles of chaos theory. So we are thrown back to a quantum computer which is reduced in the quoted text as well to a theoretical positioning; this is suspect since such a computer also functions in the lifeworld. If the brain in Penrose's text functions as _a_ quantum com- puter, what is the source of the singularity (_a_)? It seems to me that there is, in the real, deep fuzziness all the way around.

"Profit and Ego in Data Secrecy" [headline].
By John Markoff.  Special to The New York Times.
REDWOOD CITY, Calif., June 27 --
If the web of thousands of computer networks around the world be thought of as an information superhighway, then Jim Bidzos one of its best-placed toll takers.  Mr. Bidzos expects to very rich -- unless the Government has its way.
As president of a Silicon Valley company called RSA Data Security Inc., Mr. Bidzos,
39, controls the patents for software crucial to scrambling and unscrambling computer
messages so they can be sent confidentially.
Just about anyone using a computer network -- whether for sending personal
messages, filing taxes electronically, or shopping from home with a credit card --
would want such confidentiality.
On the strength of its coding technology, RSA has sold more than four million copies
of its software, and it has won wide support from industry giants like Apple Computer,
I.B.M., Lotus Development, Microsoft, Motorola, Northern Telecom, Novell and Sun
Not Just for Spies Anymore [subhead]
Until recently cryptography, the science of sending secret messages, was a province
generally populated by the armed forces, governments and their spies.  But with the
rise of commercial computer networks, cryptography has become an essential
ingredient in information-age services.
RSA's software is based on an innovation in cryptography that permits people to
exchange private messages without actually getting together beforehand and
arranging a secret password.  In the past, cryptography required that two parties to a
communication first meet to exchange a large number that enabled them to encode
and decode messages.
RSA's system employs two keys, one for encoding a message, known as a public key,
and another for decoding it, called a private key.  People who wish to receive secret
messages can freely distribute their public key, which enables senders to encode a
message.  Only with the private key can the message be decoded.
A company selling products on-line, for instance, might make its public key widely
available, which would enable customers to send in a coded message containing their
credit card numbers that could not be intercepted and read by others.  The company
could decode those messages with its private key, which has a relationship to the public one.
The Government fears that should the RSA system become available abroad, it would
lose its ability to eavesdrop and wiretap in cases involving risks to national security.  It
would much prefer that the global standard be based on its own Clipper encryption
standard, which has a "backdooor" that law enforcement officials can peek through.
Precisely because the RSA method has no backdoor, it is the choice of industry.
But to some government officials, Mr. Bidzos is nothing short of a scheming
"The Government would like him to not exist," said Jeffrey I. Schiller, computer
manager at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has negotiated a licensing
deal with Mr. Bidzos.
And Stuart Baker, who until several weeks ago was chief counsel of the National
Security Agency, observed, "My sense is that his motivation is no more than trying to
convince people to buy his products."
Officials at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, another Federal
agency, say they want to create a standard that is not beholden to the patents of one
small company.  And the National Security Agency and the Justice Department want a
standard that will allow law enforcement agencies to eavesdrop on suspected
criminals or violators of national security.
Conventional Wisdom [subhead]
cold war mentality,
and should simply get out of the way and let RSA Data go about its business.  What
is more, he complains, any number of foreign companies are developing encryption
techniques just as hard to crack as his, so the Government's efforts to keep him from
exporting his software is useless, and perhaps Notwithstanding the official concerns, RSA has developed a loyal following among a
wide range of computer, communications and software companies.  "They have the
strongest technology and the best reputation in the cryptography business," said
William Ferguson, vice president of Semaphore, Inc., a maker of systems that licenses RSA's software.
Adding spice to this dispute is Mr. Bidzos's ability to outmaneuver the Government,
most recently by snatching a crucial patent from under the noses of officials who were
planning to use it in an official standard they are trying to Several years ago, two top computer scientists from the National Institute of Standards
and Technology traveled to Europe to meet with a German mathematician, Claus
Schnorr, who holds a key patent that the Government's coding system may violate.
When they returned to the United States, the scientists told their superiors that the
United States should license Mr. Schnorr's patent.  But Washington was slow to act.
So in March 1993, while Mr. Bidzos was on a trip to France, he met with Mr. Schnorr
for a four-hour lunch.  By the end of the meal, Mr. Bidzos had a deal to use Mr.
Schnorr's patent.
Despite Mr. Bidzos's high profile in the world of encryption, RSA's revenue is small --
somewhere between $5 million and $10 million annually.  But analysts say that the
company has the ability to grow substantially.
"They have huge opportunity in the Internet," said Lisa Thorell, a researcher at
Dataquest in San Jose, Calif., referring to the global web of computer networks that is
regarded as a working but primitive model of a global data RSA is also playing an increasing role in the $500 million business for equipment that permits safe financial trasnactions and voice and data
A Question of Patents [subhead]
The issue clouding the future of the company is how severely it will suffer from export
controls and competing standards backed by the National Security Agency.  Last
month the Government made its own competing standard for signing electronic
documents mandatory for all Federal agencies, and declared that the digital signature
standard, as it is known, did not violate RSA's technology.
Mr. Bidzos thinks that Washington is infringing his patents, and, eventually, the
strength of his patent claims will be tested in court.  Rather then (sic) sue the
Government, Mr. Bidzos is likely to start with one of the small companies, like Group
Technologies Corporation, in Tampa, that is making components under a Government
contract, industry executives say.
Mr. Bidzos, who is a Greek citizen and a permanent resident of the United States, was
working at a small international marketing firm in 1985 when he decided to move from
Florida to the Silicon Valley to help a friend save a failing "I wanted to do deals and stay in luxury hotels," he said recently at his office here.  "I
had no idea I'd be in the center of a political whirlwind."
When Mr. Bidzos joined the company in 1986, RSA was shoestring operation about to
go into bankruptcy.  With his help, RSA struck a deal with Lotus Development in 1987,
in which the software giant agreed to advance money for the right to include RSA
software in Lotus Notes, a program designed for work groups of office employees.
A year later RSA was presented with an offer to be acquired by Rupert Murdoch in a
multimillion-dollar deal.  A Murdoch subsidiary, the News Data Corporation, was developing technology for Mr. Murdoch's Sky TV.  So in 1988 Mr.
Bidzos flew twice to Britain to attempt to negotiate a deal, but the sides were far apart
on price.
He says the offers to buy RSA still roll in.  "I've received no less than five firm, written
offers in the last two years," he said.
He also says he doesn't think that the Government can regain the upper hand in the
cryptography wars.
"They've fired every weapon they have at us now, and we're stronger than ever," Mr.
Bidzos said.  "All they can do is try to get RSA legislated out of business, and that will
never happen, in my

Forwarding message by scmayo at rschp2.anu.edu.au
Organization: Australian National University
The question in the subject of this thread may seem dumb to some people  in this group, but I'm curious about how varied the motivations  of  crypto-using people are.
I got PGP running on my machine a few weeks ago because I liked the  idea of being able to communicate privately if I wanted, as I felt  that email was much more insecure than other forms of communication.  I started reading some of the crypto stuff on WWW and noticed a political trend in the motivations of many of the people who are 'big' in the crypto scene in the US. The motivation for these people's interest in  cryptography seems to stem from a strong libertarian viewpoint, which  incidentally often seems to coincide with strong views about the right to bear arms. It may seem that I am being particularly naive in being  surprised by this but I am from the UK where libertarian views of this  kind are not so widely held. I have never held a hand gun and have no desire to do so. Similarly my motivations for using cryptography come simply from a desire for privacy from Govt. and other snooping but NOT  from the 'cyber-survivalist' inclinations that seem to motivate some in  the US at least. I read some stuff on Vince Cate's WWW site by Tim May about how crypto was going to bring down governments due to (legal?) tax evasion by those who are computer literate . I have to say that I think this is highly unlikely (and to be fair, Vince's site included an article by Hal Finney agreeing with my view). I know that Tim May's views are considered to  be extreme by some, but more moderate people seem to hold the view that crypto and also cyberspace (god I hate these buzzwords) in general herald an age of 'survival of the fittest' where those clued up about computers will be able to take advantage and do better due to paying less taxes  etc.
Personally I have no desire to evade tax since I quite like being able  to drive on tarmac without holes, and having schooling and health care  provided for all with the richer folk subsidising the poorer folk. I  realise my views are anathema to the libertarian and I'm curious to know  if there are other crypto users (I would NEVER call myself a cypherpunk :-)  who's interest stems from a left-wing rather than right-wing viewpoint.  I should point out that I consider tha libertarian/crypto-anarchist views  I've outlined above to be an extreme form of the (right-wing) philosphy of individualism. I'd never come across a right-wing anarchist before reading the crypto groups - weird!

Forwarding message by gtoal at an-teallach.com
Several years ago lots of British scientists died under mysterious  circumstances.  They were generally described as 'defence scientists'  but what a significant number of them had in common was work in  the area of surveillance.  Several of them were connected to UK's  system X.  I posted a long piece at the time (now lost, sorry)  hypothesising that what was going on was internecine warfare betweem  the UK and USA governments departments responsible for fitting  surveillance assistance to their telephone exchanges for contracts  with foreign countries.  (One UK govt official was found dead in  his hotel room in an arab country while there at a trade fair in  an unofficial capacity helping to promotye system X).  At that time  the UK govt had a clear lead in selling bugged exchanges because complete surveillance capability was designed in to system X -  the USA doesn't have it everywhere yet - just in exchanges from  co-operative suppliers. (Hence the 'wiretap' FBI bill, to get  everyone else to play ball too).  The ability to remotely monitor  all the phone system of a foreign country would be *extremely*  valuable to an agency like the CIA or GCHQ.  Personally I don't  doubt it's worth killing for, in their view.
It was also my view when I suggested this hypothesis some years  ago that the phone systems were being sold to these countries by  telling the respective governments that *they* could use them for  surveillance purposes.  My suspicion was that there would be extra  code buried in the switches that the customers did not know about  which would enable remote callers to use the surveillance options  too, without the host country or telco being aware of them. This  latter capability being top secret and the risk of it being made  known by disaffected employees perhaps being the reason why some  of them were killed by our own security agencies.  Hence why the  multiple suspicious deaths were never properly investigated (or at  least the investigations made public - MI5 couldn't expose the USA  dirty tricks without exposing their own.)
This is all highly speculative and I don't stand by it, I just  offer it as a hypothesis.

After recounting concern for her son's safety during a few mildly racy incidents online, she concludes that he will learn to cope with whatever comes up.  And that after giving him "his electronic safety pointers, it's time to let him go".

overseas, since all
Although NSA will neither confirm nor deny  one of the fundamental principles of cryptography is that any encryption system which cannot be broken is also inefficient - like the one-time-pad.  NSA may be concerned with allocation of CRAY resources, but I doubt they are concerned about the viability of breaking triple-DES.
One of the most important concepts of cryptography is that false security is worse than poor security, for if you are aware of a system's vulnerability, you can guard the weak points.  NSA's point that layering encryptions not only doesn't strengthen the security, but may create patterning that is more susceptible to differential analysis than a single DES pass, is an important one.  More is frequently less in crypto.
Now, I have no more insight into NSA motivations than the next shmoe, but the objections they raise are legitimate from a security standpoint.
As for independent creation in Europe, there is a component to "real" hardware DES which is classified.

Mr. Steven Levy writes an admirable article on "E-Money" in December Wired, with emphasis on Chaum's venture, along with various opinions of e-cash systems, the role of cryptography and the salient thoughts of Mr. Eric Hughes.
Mr. Levy, I pray, will excuse my quoting two provocative excerpts to induce reading the whole piece:
"Corleta Brueck, the project manager for the IRS's Document Processing System, described some of the IRS's plans.  These include the so-called 'Golden Eagle' return, in which the government automatically gathers all relevant aspects of a person's finances, sorts them into approriate categories and then tallies the tax due.  'One stop service,' as Brueck puts it.  This information would be fed to other government agencies, as well as states and municipalities, which would draw upon it for their own purposes.  She vows 'absolutely' that this will happen, assuming that Americans will be grateful to be relieved of the burden of filing any taxes.  The government will simply take its due." . . .
"[Brueck continues] 'We know everyting about you that we need to know.  Your employer tells us everything about you that we need to know. Your activity records on your credit cards tell us everything about you that we need to know.  Through interface with Social Security, with the DMV, with your banking institutions, we really have a lot of information . . . We could literally file a return for you.  This is the future we'd like to go to.' "
* * *
"It isn't the future that David Chaum would like to go to, and in hopes of preventing that degree of openess in an individual's affairs, he continues doggedly in his crusade for privacy. . . . He thinks that if an economic system that tracks all transactions comes to cyberspace, the result would be much worse than in the physical world.  'Cyberspace doesn't have all the physical constraints,' he says.  'There are not walls . . . it's a different, scary, weird place, and with identification it's a panopticon nightmare.' "
End quotes.
And, yes, for the Chaum-uncharmed, Mr. Chaum was rude to Mr. Levy.  Whether Mr. L. is rude in kind to Mr. C. is an exercise left to the reader.

Excerpts from WSJ, September 30, 1994, p. B5
Bill Would Ensure
Law Enforcement
Is Able to Tap Wires
By Mary Lu Carnevale
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
 WASHINGTON - The House Judiciary Committee cleared
a bill that would require telephone companies to
ensure that their networks remain accessible to law
enforcement wiretaps.
 But key lawmakers agreed to changes aimed at
appeasing local phone companies. The modifications
largely spell out that phone companies won't be
forced to pay to modify their existing networks to
comply with the measure. They are expected to be
included in the bill before it goes to the House
floor, possibly as early as Tuesday.
 A similar measure sailed through the Senate
Judiciary Committee earlier this week on a 16-1
vote. Though little time remains in the current
Congress, the legislation could squeak through.
* * *
 The agreement, details of which are being ironed
out, also aims to protect individuals' privacy
rights; prevent phone companies or law-enforcement
agencies from installing or ordering unnecessary
upgrades; and ensure that the changes have the
least possible effect on phone rates and
phone-company efforts to build advanced
communications networks.
 The legislation is separate from the Clinton
administration's controversial "Clipper Chip"
proposal that would have mandated an encryption
standard for computer and communications equipment.
That failed proposal would have let law-enforcement
agencies decipher any calls or messages that had
been encoded.

Sound remarks about domestic upheavals.
Parallel to these, it should be added that internal strife has declined as US foreign interventions have increased.  From Teddy Roosevelt forward, whenever domestic strain builds, there just happens to be an urgent matter somewhere else that needs patriotic attention to our "national interests".
Soothing, addictive, social and economic bribes flow from warmaking -- industrial growth, jobs, education, research, technological advances.
A bitching citizenry is a happy citizenry where domestic Government affairs are concerned, but the most obedient people are those united against a foreign foe.  Lesson 1 of world affairs leadership.

The way that the surveillance satellite systems of the US and the USSR helped to reduce fear of military planners is instructive.  This non-lethal technology, though expensive, made, and continues to make,  accidental nuclear war less likely, and seems to me to be a great service to the world's Aggressive weapons systems may be similarly replaced by non-lethal technology as scientists and technologists are asked to device such apparatus.
Fear of economic and social deprivation might also benefit from the talents of those who once produced the tools of the Cold War and hot regional conflicts you mention.
Further, this list offers other ways to envision a society less dependent on the national security rubric of big Government, and may thereby support alternative local initiatives for economic and civil affairs.
Kudos for this non-lethal work.

Method and Madness
Nicolas Wade
Little Brother
Not so long ago, high technology was seen as the likely handmaiden of
totalitarian government, with surveillance systems and central tracking  every citizen from cradle to grave. By a strange turn events, what is now in progress is the very opposite of that So many powerful technologies are streaming into private hands Government is struggling to protect even the bare minimum of legitimate domains.
Once only governments could launch photoreconnaissance satellites; now
the C.I A. is anxiously trying to curb commercial systems that discern objects as small as a yard across, high-enough resolution to
interest generals as much as geologists. A fleet of satellites designed to give military commanders their exact anywhere in the world is now in essence available to anyone; Pentagon has let the public listen in on a degraded signal, but
commercial vendors with clever algorithms can restore it to
near-military accuracy.
The computers that tie together the Government's information have become increasingly porous. The better their security systems, the
more tempting the challenge. Earlier this year the Pentagon that a coterie of computer hackers had penetrated large parts of its
sensitive though unclassified computer network and had even control of several military computers.
Think tanks and academics have warned for years, quite erroneously, that
terrorists would avail themselves of nuclear, chemical or weapons; it hasn't happened, because none of these items are easy to use
and simpler means have always been available. But the samples of stolen
Russian uranium and plutonium that have recently been captured Germany are a clear warning that this blithe era of security may now be
The samples seem to have come from reactor fuel and laboratories, not
nuclear warheads. But that is small comfort, especially in view of new
calculations that only one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of plutonium is needed
to make a bomb, not eight kilograms as was generally assumed. And the
smugglers caught by the German police were hawking four kilograms for a
mere $250 million.
Perhaps the most surprising democratization of high technology is that of
cryptography, once an elite art of those who guarded Government's most
precious secrets. The first serious challenge to the National Agency's ability to crack almost everyone else's ciphers came from an
ingenious coding approach created in academe in the mid-1970's and known
as the public key cryptosystem. The commercial sponsor sold the to American companies but was not allowed to export it. Then in 1991, a
Colorado computer expert, Philip R. Zimmermann, produced a apparently based on this system, which he named Pretty Good Privacy. A
copy of Pretty Good Privacy found its way onto the Internet, free to
takers from all countries, and all of a sudden Government-class became available to everyone. Zimmermann's next project is to develop a
pretty secure citizen's phone that scrambles conversations.
At this point, of course, it's possible to wonder if the humiliation of
Big Brother isn't being taken beyond reasonable limits. Some monopolies are not so bad: the use of force, for one. If you believe the
F.B.I. is bugging your conversations, you'll want to see Zimmermann in
the inventors' hall of fame; if terrorism and organized crime seem the
more immediate threats, the universal right to absolute privacy less compelling.
Is it possible for the state to get too weak in relation to its adversaries? That's the last thought that occurs to Americans across a
wide spectrum of opinion, from free market economists to civil
libertarians. From a variety of motives, they persistently call governmental power to be curbed. The present headlong democratization of
high technology is the flower of a decade of economic deregulation, and
of the fading influence of military procurement as a driver of The state is so familiar a political structure that its endurance is
hard to doubt. For economists and political analysts, it is the unit of account. Yet in his recent book, "The Transformation of the noted military historian Martin van Creveld argues that since modern
states are no longer able to fight each other for fear of nuclear war,
conventional warfare, too, has become outmoded. Since the purpose of
states (at least in the view of military historians) is to fight each
other, states that cannot do so must sooner or later yield to
organizations that will, like sects, tribes and cults.
"In North America and Western Europe, future war-making entities will
probably resemble the Assassins, the group which ... terrorized medieval Middle East for two centuries," van Creveld predicts. armed forces, as has happened in Lebanon, will degenerate into forces or mere armed gangs; the day of the condottieri will Van Creveld is not the only analyst to fear for the state. From different reasoning, the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington argued
in a widely read essay in Foreign Affairs last year that world would be shaped in future by clashes between cultures and religions. As
the West loses its military and economic predominance, the
counterresponse from the rest of the world will be couched in and cultural terms: "The fault lines between civilizations will be the
battle lines of the future," he wrote.
Even without fully embracing these forecasts of the state's it's hard to ignore such recent incidents as the bombing of the Trade Center or the car bombings of Jewish organizations in Buenos Aires
and London. Terrorists with secure phones, satellite maps, positioning and a sophisticated understanding of modern systems could bring down not just a few buildings but large sections of
a modern economy.
Big Brother is dead. The only serious likelihood of his lies in reaction to the chaos and disintegration that an era of Brothers might bring.

Your answers to Hal and Tim have been enlightening.
And your attempt to move away from nominalism to improve precision of language and to ward off inadverdent undermining of fundamentals, is admirable, that is, if I understand your objections to Hal's proposals correctly.
Perhaps to avoid counter-objections that matters of definition all to often lead back into nominalistic debates, you will be able to suggest practical examples of what you mean by "dangerous", "frightful", "serious consequences", "kicking the crucial foundation out from under freedom", and the like.  Sometimes these melodramatic terms obscure rather than point toward concrete situations that will convey your intentions more effectively.
Your strong feelings on these matters are clear, but I for one do not know what you would do in place of what Hal, and others, are proposing, to build and sustain reputations in the electronic realm.  Not, to be sure, to undermine what is valid in brickspace, but how such firm foundations might be extended, even emulated occasionally, in the cyber realm.
I don't yet see these efforts as threatening as you claim.  When you get a chance, your specific examples would help.

Forwarding mail by: HRL at PSUVM.PSU.EDU (Howard Ray Lawrence 814 238 9535) on      - - The original note follows - -
Doors of Perception 2: ' Conference
4+5+6 November 1994
RAI Congress Center Amsterdam
the Netherlands
*Doors of Perception* is an important meeting point for all those  interested in the design challenge of interactivity. The first conference,  in November 1993, was attended at relatively short notice by nearly 700  people from 20 countries.
*Aim of the conference
The 1994 conference, which is organised by the Netherlands Design Institute  with Mediamatic Magazine, will further develop discussion about culture,  context and innovation. The subject's importance was well put by Terry  Winograd: 'major leaps only happen when someone has a new insight into the
larger picture, and can escape from the old context'. That is the aim of  *Doors 2*.
Speakers will focus on a particular context, 'home' - as market, as  metaphor, and as myth. Industry has great expectations for home as a site  for new products, as an outlet for entertainment and information services,  and as a place of work. But when a new technology enters a culture, the  culture changes. What does that mean for 'home'?
design,  philosophy, anthropology, and psychology, speakers will consider the  cultural impact of technology on work and play, home and school, learning  and entertainment. They will compare the qualities of telematic space and  domestic space. They will talk about real nomads and telematic nomads. They will analyse changes to our  sense of place, both public and private. They will look at the psychology  of belonging - to a family, group, or community. They will explore the  architecture of information, and the creation of shared meaning, in  virtual communities.
The point of this debate is that uncritical assumptions, and a crude use of  'real world' metaphors about the home, can actually stifle innovation. Vast  resources are being devoted to digital versions of existing human  activities - teleshopping, video-on-demand, telecommuting; but attempts to  create entirely new uses for the technologies have been unambitious, to say
the least. Doors of Perception gives equal emphasis to thinking and doing.  It is not a trade show - neither is it exclusive: chief executives and  young creatives are equally 'at home' at this unique event.

*The Speakers
*Christopher Alexander
author of 'A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction': After a  ten-year silence, Christopher Alexander and his colleagues at the Center  for Environmental Strucure published a major statement in the form of three  books which will, in their words, 'lay the basis for an entirely new  approach to architecture, building and planning, which will replace  existing ideas and practices entirely'. At the core of his books is the  idea that people should design for themselves their own houses, streets,  and com
munities. This idea may be radical (it implies a radical transformation of  the architectural profession) but it comes simply from the observation that  most of the wonderful places of the world were not made by architects but  by the people.
Also author of: 'The Timeless Way of Building': The theory of architecture  implicit in our world today, Christopher Alexander believes, is bankrupt.  More and more people are aware that something is deeply wrong. Yet the  power of present-day ideas is so great that many feel uncomfortable, even  afraid, to say openly that they dislike what is happening, because they are  afraid to seem foolish, afraid perhaps that they will be laughed at. Now,  at last, here is a coherent theory which describes in modern terms an architecture as ancient as human society itself. Christopher Alexander  presents a new theory of architecture, building, and planning which has at  its core that age-old process by which the people of a society have always  pulled the order of their world from their own being.
*John Perry Barlow
studied comparative religion, has been the lyricist for The Grateful Dead  since 1972, is an insightful writer, and co-founded, with Mitchell Kapor  and Stephen Wozniak,the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The EFF pushes  ethical and political issues of the new media onto the international agenda  - freedom of speech, privacy, intellectual property, and other social  consequences of a network culture.
*Alfred Birnbaum
who was born in China and raised in Japan, is a noted translator in  Japanese (of such authors as Murakami), an artist with the Kyoto-based  performance group 'Dumb Type', and a highly original researcher of diverse  popular phenomena in contemporary Japan, which he compares to deeply rooted  Asian cultural traditions.
*'Breaking stories, eye candy and mental muesli'  as one journalist described 'Doors 1', will again feature in this year's  conference. How is interactivity to be designed? What methodologies and  management skills are needed for what is, by definition, a  multi-diciplinary activity? A keen reader of conference blurbs will also  appreciate that this paragraph has been added at artwork stage to replace  the cv of a key speaker, whose name begins with B, who has de-confirmed.  But we'll replace him.
*Amy Bruckman
a doctoral candidate at MIT, founded MediaMOO, a text-based virtual reality  environment designed as a professional on-line community for media  researchers.For her dissertation, Bruckman is creating a MUD for children  called MOOSE Crossing, designed to be an authentic context in which kids  can learn reading, writing and programming. Bruckman will explain what MUDs  and MOOs actually are in her presentation.
*Florian Brody
who studied linguistics and computer science in Vienna, investigates the  relationship between computers, memory and identity. He worked in the  Austrian National Library on automation management, and was technical  director of the 'expanded books' project at Voyager Publishing in  California, before founding New Media Consulting. He teaches at Vienna  University, and he is president of the Austrian Society for Virtuality,  Telepresence and Cyberspace.
*David Chaum
is managing director of DigiCash, an Amsterdam-based company that is a  world pioneer in electronic cash payment systems. Dr Chaum is also chairman  of CAFE, the European Union research consortium investigating the technical  infrastructure and equipment for electronic money in Europe. He took a PhD  in computer science at Berkeley, taught at NYU Graduate School of Business,  and founded the International Association for Cryptological Research.
*Manuel De Landa
a New York-based artist, is also the author of 'War In The Age Of  Intelligent Machines'. From a vantage point at the intersection of chaos  theory and post-structuralism, De Landa described how military technology  has altered the relationship between humans, their machines, and  information. In his new book Phylum: A Thousand Years Of Non-Linear  History, De Landa considers the cottage-industrialisation of the world, and  the global spread of a 'population of firms' .
*Thomas Dolby
is a pop-star-hacker-programmer who saw in immersive virtual reality a new  medium for musical expression. He created the audio studio Headspace that  allows the user to wander round a classic string quartet as it plays.  Currently working with Joy Mountford's group at Interval Research  Corporation in California, Dolby is also developing an interactive version  of Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation which will be released on CDRom.
*Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby
a research and design partnership based in London, explore the  inter-relationships between industrial design, architecture and electronic  media. Their recent work, which has focussed on what they call the 'poetics  of telecommunications', includes the Fields & Thresholds project for the  Netherlands Design Institute, an investigation into communicative and  design implications of a 'virtual institute'.
*Lynn Hershman
is a Senior Professor at the University of California where she initiated  the IDEA laboratory devoted to electronic arts. Among her award- winning  videotapes and interactive installations are The Electronic Diary and  Virtual Love, the latter a long narrative about breaking through the screen  that separates us from our media-derived fantasies. Hershman is currently  completing a sequel, The Twisted Chord, charting the telephone from Bell  through to the Internet.
*Peter Lamborn Wilson
was described by Erik Davis in the Village Voice this year as an  'underground anarcho-Sufi scholar (whose) work explores the historical and  mystical dimensions of Sufism and Islamic heresy, as in his latest book  Sacred Drift. His surprisingly virulent concept/buzzword 'temporary  autonomous zones' spread through the computer underground to Time magazine.  His lectures argue for the ultimate unity of imagination and intellectual  investigation'.
*Patti Maes
who received her PhD in computer science at the University of Brussels,  researches artificial life and artificial intelligence, and recently  produced 'Alive', an interactive installation involving 'virtual pets',  whose future in the home she will explain to the conference.Maes has worked  at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and more recently as an  assistant professor at MediaLab, since 1990. Her research focusses on the  modelling of all kinds of artificial intelligence 'agents'.
*William Mitchell's
new book 'City of Bits': Space, Place and Infobahn, which addresses central  concerns of the Home theme,will be published in 1995. Mitchell, who is  Professor of Architecture and Media Arts and Sciences, and Dean of the  School of Architecture, at MIT, conducts research in design theory,  computer applications in architecture and urban design. His other books  include The Reconfigured Eye which deals with the social and cultural  impact of digitally altererd photographs .
*Mitch Ratcliffe
as editor-in-chief of the influential industry newsletter Digital Media, is  well-placed to distinguish between hype and reality, and to explain which  technologies will actually work, and when, on the infobahnen. He is the  co-author (with Andrew Gore) of Powerbook: The Digital Nomad's Guide and is  now completing a book on the World Wide Web which analyses the economic,  social and political implications of software agent *Jeffrey Shaw
is director of the media institute at Karlsruhe Media Centre in Germany.  Shaw studied architecture in Australia, and art in Milan and London, before  working on interactive and virtual space projects from a base in The  Netherlands, where he also taught at the Rietveld Academie. He has shown  such award-winning projects as TheLegible City, The Narrative Landscape,  and The Virtual Museum at festivals and workshops throughout Europe, the  USA and Japan.
*Marco Susani
is a teacher and researcher at Domus Academy, the research centre and  postgraduate design school in Milan. An expert on the design of services,  Susani explores the relationship between dematerialisation - for example,  of communications - and scenarios for a sustainable economy in which  radically less matter and energy are consumed. His recent work focusses on  conviviality - the behavioural threshold that offers one route for  technology to enter the home.
*Philip Tabor's
doctoral thesis at Cambridge University concerned the limits of 'automated'  architectural design. He co-founded the Centre for Land Use and Built Form  Studies (now the Martin Centre), and the computer aided design consultancy,  Applied Research of Cambridge, which is now part of McDonnell Douglas. For  ten years a partner in Edward Cullinan Architects, specialising in housing,  Philip Tabor was until recently Director of the Bartlett School of  Architecture in London.
*Shin-Ichi Takemura
teaches anthropology, international affairs and cultural design, including  ethnic arts, at Touhoku University of Art and Design. His trans-cultural  analysis of communication processes , media structures and design issues  includes a particular emphasis on an 'ecology of body and mind'. Takemura  is convenor of the Asian Cultural Design Forum and Human Ecology Round  Table. His team is also involved in planning such public facilities as the  proposed Eco-Aesthetic Museum.
*Pauline Terreehorst
in her recently completed book Het Boerderijmodel - 'The Farm Mould' -  argues that the new communication technologies may help transform the home  into a 'farm' again. Terreehorst also speculates that the re-location of  home as a focal point of the electronic superhighway will and foster  positive changes in relationships between men and women. Home played such a  positive role before industrialisation forced people to separate home from  work.

The New York Times today reports:
"Electronic purses" may mean the end of cash.  Banks, credit card companies and even some governments are racing to introduce electronic purses, wallet-size cards embedded with microchips that store sums of money for people to use instead of cash for everything from buying fast food to paying highway * * *
Long-range planners in the banking industry see the weaning of small businesses and consumers from cash as the last step to closing many expensive branches and conducting virtually all business by telephone, through cash machines and perhaps home * * *
"As more and more people do business on the Internet, we have to look for how you pay for things," said Catherine Allen, a vice president in Citibank's technology office and the head of the Smart Card Forum, an industry group.  "The smart card allows me to identify myself securely."
* * *
But Mondex [Britain's system] has still another wrinkle:  Unlike most other electronic purse systems, Mondex, like cash, is anonymous.  The banks that issue Mondex cards will not be able to keep track of who gets the payments.  Indeed, it is the only system in which two card holders can transfer money to each other.
"If you want to have a product that replaces cash, you have to do everything that cash does, only better," Mondex's senior executive, Michael Keegan said.  "You can give money to your brother who gives it to the chap that sells newspapers, who gives it to charity, who puts it in the bank, which has no idea where it's been.  That's what money is." End quotes.

Responding to msg by tcmay at netcom.com (Timothy C. May) on Wed, 7 Sep  4:14 PM
It is worth noting that private "data havens" of all sorts abound, especially for financial matters, and most are not subject to governmental regulation.
Some banks have research departments that are older and more comprehensive than credit reporting agencies.  Favored customers can use them for evaluation of private deals.  Large law firms maintain data banks that approach those of banks, and they grow with each case, through additions of private investigators paid for by successive clients.
Security professionals, like Wackenhut and Kroll, also market the fruits of substantial data collections.
To these add those of insurance, bonding, investment, financial firms and the like which help make or break business deals.
It's probable that massive government-regulated consumer data banks contain far less useful information than that of the private market where serious money is made with the best, privileged information.
Some may be porous but most are guarded better than Ft. Knox, with special protection against Uncle Sam's snoopers, indeed more secure than consumer records because more valuable.
Any c'punkers in the security side of the financial industry want to comment?  Anonymously of course.

Responding to msg by doug at OpenMind.com (Doug Cutrell) on Fri, 9 Sep 12:36 PM:
Your critique has elicited some of the best responses I've seen There is still, indeed,  the task of proving that cryptoanarchy is not itself a play for power by those who write and master its cryptographic code.  But better to test that in the public arena rather remain hidden and protected like the state secrecy of governmental cryptography.
The state will probably fiercely  oppose it, not least by stigmatizing cryptoanarchy and impugning its motives by exaggeration and distortion.
(It is worth recalling that classical black anarchy, the secret, lethal version as distinguished from open black flag type, is used by despots to justify their ruthless measures.  Black anarchists, as agents of despots,  mingle with avowed flag-wavers to spy and provoke acts that lead to repressive crackdowns.  Black anarchists never announce themselves as such but may freely admit to being "anarchistic" as a wild-eyed subterfuge.  Inept provocations sometimes reveal them but the most able are never detected.)
I may be helpful to read one writer's view of how cryptoanarchy may be lumped with and targeted like other stigmatized groups whose attributes it may claim:

DEVIATIONS AND DEVIANCE
One such deviation is important here, the kind presented by
individuals who are seen as declining voluntarily and openly to
accept the social place accorded them, and who act irregularly somewhat rebelliously in connection with our basic institutions the family, the age-grade system, the stereotyped role-division
between the sexes, legitimate full-time employment involving
maintenance of a single governmentally ratified personal and segregation by class and race. These are the Those who take this stand on their own and by themselves might called eccentrics or "characters." Those whose activity is
collective and focused within some building or place (and often
upon a special activity) may be called cultists. Those who come
together into a sub-community or milieu may be called "social
deviants", and their corporate life a deviant community. They
constitute a special type, but only one type, of deviator.
If there is to be a field of inquiry called "deviance," it is
social deviants as here defined that would presumably its core. Prostitutes, drug addicts, delinquents, criminals, musicians, bohemians, gypsies, carnival workers, hobos, winos, people, full time gamblers, beach dwellers, homosexuals, and urban unrepentant poor -- these would be included.
These are the folk who are considered to be engaged in some kind of
collective denial of the social order. They are perceived as
failing to use available opportunity for advancement in the approved runways of society; they show open disrespect for betters; they lack piety; they represent failures in the
motivational schemes of society.
Once the core of social deviancy is established, one can proceed to
peripheral instances: community-based political radicals who only vote in a divergent way but spend more time with those of
their own kind than is politically necessary; the traveling who are not geared into the executive's work week, and spend time drifting from one summering place to another; expatriates,
employed or not, who routinely wander at least a few steps from PX and the American Express; the ethnic assimilation who are reared in the two worlds of the parent society and the
society of their parents, and resolutely turn away from the
conventional routes of mobility open to them, overlaying their
public school socialization with what many normals will see as grotesque costume of religious orthodoxy; the metropolitan
unmarried and merely married who disavail themselves of an
opportunity to raise a family, and instead support a vague that is in rebellion, albeit mild and short-lived, against the
family system
In almost all of these cases, some show of disaffiliation is as is also true of eccentrics and cultists, providing in this a thin line that can be drawn between all of them and deviators the other side, namely, the quietly disaffiliated--hobbyists become so devoted to their avocation that only a husk remains civil attachments, as in the case of some ardent stamp club tennis players, and sports car buffs.
Social deviants, as defined, flaunt their refusal to accept place and are temporarily tolerated in this gestural rebellion,
providing it is restricted within the ecological boundaries of
their community. Like ethnic and racial ghettos, these constitute a haven of self-defense and a place where the deviator can openly take the line that he is at least as good anyone else. But in addition, social deviants often feel that are not merely equal to but better than normals, and that the they lead is better than that lived by the persons they would
otherwise be. Social deviants also provide models of being for
restless normals, obtaining not only sympathy but also (Cultists acquire converts too, of course, but the focus is on
programs of action not styles of life.) The wise can become

The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto
Timothy  C.  May
tcmay at netcom.com
A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy. Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-routing of packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be
of central importance, far more important in dealings than even credit ratings of today.
These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the
ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of
trust and reputation.
The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social
and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The
methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction,
authentication, and verification. The focus has until now been academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently have networks and  personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the
ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards,
satellites,  Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and
encryption chips now under development will be some of the technologies. The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by
drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make
possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. criminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But
this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.
Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of
medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.
Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!

The fractal steganography sounds promising.  Is this yours or has it been done?
The need for authentic sigs on architectural and engineering drawings is not merely aesthetic.  Right now municipal agencies will not accept digital documents because of the lack of verifiable authorship to establish responsibility, and liability, for the health and safety of the design and construction.  Hard copy with original seal is required to prevent unauthorized manipulation.
Beyond copyright protection, architectural and engineering documents are means to guide actual construction, rather than end products like paintings and drawings in the art world.
If there could be a way for buildings themselves to convey authenticity, say, that they are healthy and safe, by a kind decryption by the public that could help prevent concealment of shoddy construction.  It's not the drawings that assure safety but field verification of the end result that construction work was done right.
What a great help if a building could convey its own message of authenticity about its fitness and safety for habitation and use.  That might keep us architects more honest.
Probably a long shot that your fractal idea could be stretched this far, but it is certainly needed in the flim flam world of New York City real estate where deception about building safety and health is all too common.
Any other thoughts?

On the contrary, his optimism, it seems to me, derives from his own hard work and original thinking not from parroting any party line.
With this he is in the company of original thinkers like Karl Hess, Murrary Bookchin and others who have garnered the courage to grow beyond the simple faith of left-right comforts and Their writings have a generosity of scope and purpose that exemplify how to assess specific problems and to prescribe remedies, and thereby perhaps help us break free of the mesmerizing, melodramatic defecations of partisan politics.

RSA Data Security
Says Exposed Code
Poses No Threat
By Ralph T. King Jr.
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
The anonymous dissemination over the last several
days of a software code used to safeguard the
privacy of electronic messages in no way threatens
the security of existing computer networks,
according to the code's owner and encryption
However, the defiant act is expected to trigger a
trade-secret dispute between the culprit and RSA
Data Security Inc., the Redwood City, Calif.,
company that developed the code. The act also
raises thorny legal questions about how public
data networks, collectively known as the Internet,
may be used.
An unidentified person used the Internet to post
RSA's encryption code, called RC4, on electronic
bulletin boards. The RC4 code works something like
a padlock. But knowing how the lock works isn't
enough to open it. The system user has an
individualized combination or key that prevents
access by other parties to private computer
messages. RSA's code product is incorporated in numerous
popular software programs, including those of
Apple Computer Inc., Lotus Development Corp. and
Microsoft Corp. Some reports published over the
weekend indicated that the disclosure might
jeopardize the integrity of computer systems that
are equipped with these programs.
"This doesn't compromise systems that are in use,"
says Jim Bidzos, president of closely-held RSA.
"This is a misappropriation of our intellectual
property. It's a legal issue and it will be
pursued." Mr. Bidzos also said officials at U.S.
Customs Service and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation are investigating the matter.
One analyst noted that disclosure of the formula
may benefit RSA because some users have questioned
whether its code contains the equivalent of secret
trapdoors enabling people familiar with it to
eavesdrop on private communications at will. As a
result, some computer operators have turned to an
alternative code whose formula is publicly
available. Now it will be clear to interested parties that no
such trapdoors exist, Mr. Bidzos said. In any
case, RSA is about to release a new encryption
code for use with the latest computer-chip
architecture, he said.
One possible effect of the disclosure is to shed
light on the extent of legal liability that
applies to people who make copyrighted or
protected material freely available on the
Internet. Those who use such material under
license typically sign nondisclosure agreements.
In this case, someone apparently violated a
nondisclosure pact and in effect invalidated the
protections of RSA, the formula's owner.

of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.  "But from about 1985 onward nobody's
been able to say if they are good or bad, and from 1990 onward nobody's been able
to say exactly why we need them."

   "Your Home Computer Will Soon Be Your Banker and Broker."
      The first on-line banking transaction will be a historic
      moment not unlike the first automobile sale or the first
      commercial airline flight. It will signal a commercially
      viable use of a new technology that may ultimately
      eliminate what until now we have considered the retail
      aspects of banking, stock brokerage and more. The
      implications are profound.
      The promise is electronic access to all financial
      transactions at substantially lower cost. One's personal
      computer can, in essence, become an in-home bank branch,
      brokerage outlet and financial planner.
      For example, with Intuit's software and with its union
      with American Express, Smith Barney and 17 large banks,
      consumers will be able use one link for the first time
      to access traditional banking, credit- and charge-card
      services, brokerage services, financial planning and
      more.
      The effect on the banking and brokerage business and
      their employees is going to be profound. The retail
      sales forces of banks and brokerage houses may shrink
      substantially, as may the ranks of financial planners.
      The number of bank and brokerage buildings may also
      shrink.

      signals given off by the halo of satellites, and
      calculate what the satellites were saying about the

      not rely on the satellites to determine its location; it
      would already know that precisely.

      establish a correction factor. It would radio the
      correction factor to a different satellite, one in
      geosynchronous orbit over the United States, meaning
      that its position did not change relative to the earth's
      surface.
      The geosynchronous satellite would radio a correction

   "Spies Unlike Us: A history of French intelligence reveals
   a far more brutal approach than this country's."
      The aftermath of 1945 imposed an additional heavy burden
      on the French secret services. Political allegiances
      were exacerbated by the presence of a potential huge
      Communist fifth column in France. The rough lessons of
      the war led to a premium on "service action" operations
      of sabotage and assassination before which Britain's

      With the explosion of worldwide interest in the
      Internet, the dominance of English, stemming from the
      network's beginnings in the United States, has become a
      sensitive matter. A fear is that English, already the
      international language of business and science, is
      becoming the lingua franca of the computer world as
      well, further casting other languages in the shade. And
      some countries, already unhappy with the encroachment of
      American culture are worried that their cultures will be
      further eroded by an American dominance in cyberspace.
      A consortium of American computer companies has

      the news that the Soviet Union possessed an atom bomb.
      And the reason the Russians had achieved the bomb was
      mainly spying, Mr. Rhodes insists. So his story of the

      Ominous signs already exist, says the scholar Mark
      Slouka that virtual reality has begun to replace real
      life -- or "R.L.," as it is dismissively referred to by
      computer freaks. Even those poor benighted folks who

      watching fictionalized accounts of real-life events, or
      at ballgames, listening to radio broadcasts of the very
      game being played before their eyes. As Mr. Slouka puts
      it, more and more of us "accept the copy as the
      original," a development that is sure to accelerate in
      coming years with lasting social, cultural and political
      effects. Mr. Slouka foresees a sinister new world in
      which telecommunications replaces physial contact and
      meaningless abstractions replace a sense of community
      and place: a solipsistic world turned in on itself and
      easily subject to manipulation by politicians.

   "With Internet Cachet, Not Profit, New Stock Is Wall St.'s

      A 15-month-old company that has never made a dime of
      profit had one of the most stunning debuts in Wall
      Street history yesterday as investors rushed to pour
      their money into cyberspace. The Netscape Communications
      Corporation became the latest -- and hottest -- company
      in the Internet business to list shares on the nation's
      stock exchanges. Shares of Netscape, which had been
      priced at $28 before trading began at 11 A.M. opened far
      higher -- at $71. The shares soon surged to as high as
      $74.75. It was the best opening day for a stock in Wall
      Street history for an issue of its size. But even more
      significantly, it was a sign of how the rush to
      commercialize the global computing web known as the
      Internet has created an investor frenzy not seen in the
      technology industry since the early days of the personal
      computer more than a decade ago. "There is a mania under

      The company's co-founder and chairman, who holds 9.7

      half-billion dollars. Making his first fortune yesterday
      was Marc L. Andreessen, Netscape's 24-year-old vice

@_subject: \"S1\" encryption system 
Is it possible that there are multiple levels of encryption
   included in the "S1" algorithm?
   This question is prompted by reviewing the DoD's Multilevel
   Security (MLS) Program at:
         One of the features of this program is to design means to
   simultaneously transmit data with different levels of
   security, so that communicants send and/or read the data
   according to their levels of security clearance. This is
   amplified in Section 3 of the program description at:
         Excerpts:
      Multilevel security allows information systems to
      provide capabilities that augment its existing
      single-level data processing and data communications
      services. Data of multiple security levels are        processed and transferred by the system, which also
      separates the different security levels and controls
      access to the data. ...
      When a system operates in the multilevel mode, it allows
      data of two or more security levels to be processed
      simultaneously when not all users have the clearance,
      formal authorization, or need to know for all data
      handled by the system. The system is able to separate
      and protect the data according to these restrictions.
      To amplify the definition, an MLS system might process
      both Secret and Top Secret collateral data and have some
      users whose maximum clearance is Secret and others whose
      maximum clearance is Top Secret. Another MLS system
      might have all its users cleared at the Top Secret
      level, but have the ability to release information
      classified as Secret to a network consisting of only
      Secret users and systems. Still another system might
      process both Secret and Unclassified information and
      have some users with no clearance. In each of these
      instances, the system must implement mechanisms to
      provide assurance that the system's security policy is
      strictly enforced. In these examples, the policy        allows access to the data by only those users who are
      appropriately cleared and authorized (e.g., having
      formal access approval) and who have an official need to
      know for the data.
      A related mode of operation is the partitioned mode,
      also known as compartmented mode. Although similar
      concepts and solutions are involved for compartmented
      mode operations as are for the multilevel mode, there is
      also a key difference. In the compartmented mode, all
      users have clearances for all the data processed but may
      not have authorizations for all the data; whereas for
      multilevel mode, some users may not even be cleared for
      the highest level. Because the compartmented mode is
      often envisioned for the intelligence community, all
      such users would have Top Secret security clearances and
      often authorizations for one or more, but possibly not
      all, compartments in the system.
   End excerpts.
   There are also descriptions of the soft and hardware
   implementations of MLS.
   Would anyone care to comment on how this differentiation of
   levels of security is done, by a single encryption program
   or multiples, and if multiples, their arrangement? Is
   feature then embedded in the hardware, such as the Fortezza
   card system cited in the program?

   "Bigger Than the Family, Smaller Than the State: Are
   voluntary groups what make countries work?" [Book review]
      Mr. Fukuyama has shifted his attention from the state to
      society; the result is a fascinating and frustrating
      book, "Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of
      Prosperity." We have settled on the structure of the
      state, he writes, but "liberal political and economic
      institutions depend on a healthy and dynamic civil
      society for their vitality."
      In the world of ideas, civil society is hot. It is
      almost impossible to read an article on foreign or
      domestic politics without coming across some mention of
      the concept. And "civil society" has bipartisan appeal;
      from Hillary Rodham Clinton to Pat Buchanan, politicians
      of all stripes routinely sing its praises.
      Behind much of the new interest in civil society, on the
      part of communitarians as well as social conservatives,
      is the idea that culture and society shape the nature of
      government. But the space between the realm of
      government and that of the family can be filled with all
      kinds of associations, liberal and illiberal. Historians
      have amply laid out how the Nazi Party made its first
      inroads through infiltrating local groups. On a less
      extreme note, many of the small groups that have formed
      in America over the last two decades have been
      thoroughly illiberal in spirit: victims' groups that
      have discouraged individual responsibility, minority
      clubs that have Balkanized the campus and the workplace,
      pseudoreligious cults with violent agendas. Not all of
      civil society is civic minded.
      A report on Timothy J. McVeigh's civil life noted that
      Mr. McVeigh and Terry and James Nichols, would go
      bowling and plan their future. But perhaps we would all
      have been better off if Mr. McVeigh had gone bowling
      alone.

This seems worth posting in full:
   The New York Times, August 14, 1995, pp. D1, D8.
   Rift Emerges Over Computer Data Secrecy Issue
   By John Markoff
   Some of biggest names in the computer industry sent
   separate letters to the White House last week in
   pre-emptive moves aimed at a proposed regulation originally
   intended to insure that law-enforcement officials have
   access to encoded telephone and computer communications.
   The proposal may be released as soon as this week.
   But as the Government's task force on the encryption issue
   prepared to disclose the closely held details of the
   proposal -- the latest version of a measure revealed more
   than three years ago but subsequently reconsidered in the
   face of industry opposition -- unexpected divisions emerged
   from the last-minute, scattershot lobbying.
   The splits are developing at a crucial moment, with the
   Government's interagency task force also apparently divided
   between those favoring maximum governmental access to
   communications and those who support a loosening of export
   restrictions. Most industry executives had hoped to present
   a united front in favor of the more liberal position -- a
   goal that now appears to be in jeopardy.
   The two major groups sending letters to Vice President Al
   Gore, the Administration's point man on technology issues,
   were a group of computer hardware manufacturers and a group
   of the largest makers of software.
   In a letter sent to the Vice President last Thursday, eight
   executives, including James Treybig, chairman of Tandem
   Computers Inc.; Gil F. Amelio, chairman of the National
   Semiconductor Corporation; Edward McCracken, chairman of
   Silicon Graphics Inc.; Eugene Shanks Jr. president of the
   Bankers Trust New York Corporation, which conducts
   international electronic commerce, and Stephen T. Walker,
   chairman of Trusted Information Systems, urged that the
   Government immediately establish a new standard to control
   the export of technology that is used to encode
   communications, so that outsiders cannot tap in.
   A day later, however, a group of software publishers,
   including William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft
   Corporation; Jim P. Manzi, president of the Lotus
   Development Corporation and a senior vice president of
   I.B.M., Robert Frankenberg, chairman of Novell Inc.; Mark
   B. Hoffman, chairman of Sybase Inc., and Carol Bartz,
   chairwoman of Autodesk Inc., wrote arguing that the
   possible restrictive regulations that may soon be offered
   by the Government would fail to remove the current
   obstacles that keep American companies from competing in
   lucrative international markets.
   Many off-the-shelf programs cannot be marketed abroad
   without alteration under current regulations. For example,
   before American publishers can sell the popular Lotus Notes
   program abroad, they must replace its encoding system with
   a weakened version so that foreign communications can be
   monitored by American intelligence agencies. These
   restrictions date to the 1970's when advanced computer
   technology was treated as the equivalent of military
   technology and subject to the same strict controls.
   The software publishers have been able to sell their highly
   effective communications encoding products in this country,
   while sales abroad, they contend, have been hurt. Their
   letter also said that although the Administration agreed
   last year to work with industry toward a compromise, "there
   has been only minimal consultation with the software
   industry with respect to basic questions."
   "We're worried the Government is about to announce the son
   of Clipper," said Robert W. Holleyman 2d, president of the
   Business Software Alliance, referring to the Government's
   original proposal for changing the standard. This proposal,
   released in April 1993, would have replaced the cold
   war-era restrictions with a coding standard that allowed
   sales of strong encryption programs, but would have given
   United States law-enforcement agencies access to all
   communications through a back door with a numerical key.
   "The Administration has been trying to resolve how to keep
   U.S. companies competitive, but there remain individuals in
   the Government who want to do anything they can to slow the
   proliferation of new encryption technologies," Mr.
   Holleyman said.
   In April 1992, the Administration proposed a hardware-based
   system for protecting the privacy of telephone calls and
   computer data transmissions. The standard, known as the
   Clipper Chip, included a special "backdoor" that would
   permit law-enforcement officials to listen to conversations
   and monitor data exchanges.
   The original Clipper system called for a two-part key for
   decoding scrambled conversations. The two parts of the key
   -- actually two large numbers -- were to be held by two
   independent Government agencies. Under the plan, when a
   law-enforcement agency had a warrant to listen to a
   conversation encoded by Clipper, it would obtain the keys
   from the separate agencies. By merging the keys, it could
   obtain a key that would unlock the coded conversation.
   The Clipper proposal met with angry opposition both from
   advocates for civil liberties, who argued it would
   undermine the right to privacy, and by high-technology
   executives who said Clipper would be unacceptable for
   foreign users who would not want their conversations to be
   readable by the United States Government.
   The announcement of the new proposal may be imminent. Two
   trade associations, the Software Publishers Association and
   the American Electronic Association, are planning a
   conference on cryptography policy for Friday.
   Several people familiar with Administration policy
   discussions said the Government had until recently remained
   divided and that the director of the Federal Bureau of
   Investigation, Louis J. Freeh, has been the most vocal
   advocate of placing strict limits on any use of
   unsanctioned encryption technology.
   After the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City,
   the F.B.I., circulated a proposed antiterrorism bill on
   Capitol Hill that would have banned even the domestic use
   of coding software except for systems approved by the
   Government.

   [Review excerpts] *Network Security, Private Communication    a Public World*, review by O. Ryan Tabibian
   The book is grouped into three parts: "Cryptography,'
   "Authentication," and "Electronic Mail." There is also a
   "Leftover" section, which covers security with popular
   network operating systems such as Microsoft Windows NT and
   NetWare.
   Most books fail to cover the difficult subject of
   cryptography effectively. *Network Security*, however,
   clearly describes the different cryptography methods --
   such as secret key, hashing, and public-key cryptography --
   as well as a variety of other technologies, including
   Diffie-Hellman and RSA.
   The second section, "Authentication," deals with how a
   system or persons you are communicating with can verify
   your identity. Verification schemes range from simple
   passwords to complex digital signatures. The authors do a
   remarkable job of describing and analyzing the variety of
   authentication methods.
   Since the majority of your access to the outside world is
   through e-mail, your messages are probably most vulnerable.
   The book covers some of the popular e-mail security
   schemes, such as public key and privacyenhanced mail. A
   brief overview of X.400 is also included.
   Overall this is perhaps the most comprehensive, yet
   easiest-to-understand book covering network security
   available.

   the back of your card for an alternative language, you've
   got several square inches back there, plenty of room for
   data.
   What will we use it for? The database stuff is the easy and
   obvious part. Since the computer industry and IS
   departments are likely to be the earliest adopters, it
   would be a simple matter to standardize on a format that
   the reader spits out for easy importation into just about
   anything. If the software and I/O devices are cheap enough,
   the rest of the world will come along -- and benefit.
   Authentication is a potentially huge application. In some
   South American countries, fraudulent representation is
   common. Crooks collect business cards from legitimate
   businesspeople and then misrepresent themselves to
   perpetrate a variety of scams. As a result, businesspeople
   commonly tear a corner of their card as they hand it to
   you. You don't trust a card that wasn't torn in front of
   you.
   A more elegant solution lies in a new Kodak technology that
   can encode your likeness in as little as 500 bytes,
   readable by your PDA, notebook, or desktop machines. You
   could also include a machine-readable version of your

   French Hacker Cracks Netscape Code, Shrugging Off U.S.
   Encryption Scheme
   By Jared Sandberg
   A computer hacker in France has breached the encryption
   scheme of new Netscape software for navigating the
   Internet, the global computer network. The breach
   underscores flaws in U.S. rules restricting the export of
   more-sophisticated security measures.
   The hacker, a French student at the Ecole Polytechnique,
   cracked the weaker encryption scheme that U.S. government
   policy forces Netscape Communications Corp. to use in a
   foreign version of its Navigator software. Yesterday, he
   posted the results of his efforts on the Internet's
   Cypherpunks discussion group.
   The student took up a challenge issued on July 14 in the
   Cypherpunks group, which is frequented by cryptography
   experts and hackers and mathematicians. He used 120
   powerful computer workstations and two supercomputers to
   crack a piece of information encrypted in Netscape's
   "browser" software. The security is aimed at scrambling
   sensitive financial data to keep credit-card numbers, sales
   transactions and other material safe from breakms.
   The highly sophisticated computers took eight days to break
   the code -- far more power and time than the typical
   illegal hacker would be able to muster for criminal
   pursuits. But the chore nonetheless highlights the
   vulnerabilities that could make customers shy away from
   conducting commerce on the Internet, particularly
   international users who can't get hold of the tougher
   security measures allowed within the U.S.
   The French hacker was able to crack the so-called 40-bit
   encryption scheme in Netscape's overseas version of its
   software. In the U.S., Netscape employs a far more powerful
   design -- 128 bits, a number that refers to length of the
   encoding "key," which is used to scramble data.
   U.S. rules limit Netscape to exporting only 40-bit
   encryption overseas. Yet the 128-bit version takes
   exponentially more power to crack: Compared with violating
   the 40-bit scheme, the 128-bit key would take
   10-to-the-26th-power more time to breach, experts say.
   That's a 1 followed by 26 zeroes, a factor of time that
   makes it all but impossible for hackers to break in.
   Netscape wasn't surprised at the findings. The company said
   it has always known and stated that 40-bit security could
   be breached by "brute force," the use of massive computing
   power to descramble the information.
   "This is a good indication of why the government should
   allow us to ship more secure software," said Mike Homer,
   Netscape's vice president of marketing. "The laws are
   archaic."
   Clinton administration officials have viewed strong
   encryption as a weapon for foreign terrorists, who could
   exchange communications without fear of eavesdropping by
   law enforcement officials.
   That policy, however, has raised the hackles of industry
   executives, who say that without strong encryption abroad,
   the growth of electronic commerce could be significantly
   stunted. Last week, a group of software executives told the
   White House that restrictive export regulations might blunt
   American competitiveness in foreign markets.
   "Netscape security is fine," said Dietrich Cappe, a senior
   partner at Red Planet LLC, an Internet consulting company.
   "As long as the government's export restriction exists,
   commerce is going to be severely hampered." Netscape
   licenses the encryption algorithm from RSA Data Security
   Inc., one of the most prominent software security firms
   that licenses its software to most major software
   companies. "We've warned the government that the level of
   security they allow our customers to export is too weak,"
   said James Bidzos, president of RSA. "Maybe they'll listen
   now."
   Netscape's Mr. Homer noted, however, that the amount of
   effort and computing power, which could cost as much as
   $10,000 in addition to the cost of the machines, don't make
   even breaches of 40-bit security practical from a thief's
   perspective.
   "You'd be better off working in a shoe store, stealing
   credit card numbers for a week." Mr. Homer said.

      at best, to offer lower interest rates to consumers or,
      at worst, at least to dissipate their excess profits in

      calling their banks with specially equipped telephones.
       "We're in a state of chaos," said Stephan Seidman, the

      year ago banks said there was no good reason to issue
      smart cards. Now they are in a headlong plunge to get

   U.S. to Urge A New Policy On Software
   Affempt at Compromise On Scrambling of Data
   By John Markoff
   The Clinton Administration broke a year of silence on its
   data-scrambling policy yesterday by saying it would soon
   propose an alternative to the Government's so-called Clipper
   Chip system, which has been widely criticized by makers and
   users of computer technology.
   The Administration announcement is an attempt to reach a
   compromise with American corporations on a software coding
   system that would protect the privacy of communication over
   computer networks while still permitting court-authorized
   wiretaps and eavesdropping by law enforcement officials.
   Critics of the Clipper Chip have opposed it because the
   Government refused to allow public examination of the
   underlying technology to make sure there were no secret
   backdoors that might allow unauthorized spying.
   Privacy-rights advocates attacked the policy because it
   called for a Government agency to hold a numeric key to
   each user's code. And technology executives have opposed
   the Government's data-scrambling policy because it
   restricts export of other types of data-security systems,
   which is seen as an impediment to sales of American
   computer products overseas.
   Officials of the Commerce Department's National Institute
   of Standards and Technology, which administers the data-
   scrambling standard, said yesterday that the Government
   would convene a workshop on Sept. 6 and 7 to discuss the
   new proposal. The topics include a proposal to relax the
   export policy and discussion of an alternative to Clipper
   technology that would be more palatable to industry
   executives.
   Industry officials had written two weeks ago to Vice
   President Al Gore, calling for resumption of talks that had
   broken off last year. In the talks last year industry
   leaders had met with Government officials to seek Clipper
   Chip alternatives.
   "I think that moving ahead with industry dialogue is
   positive," Robert W. Holleyman 2d, president of the
   Business Software Alliance, said yesterday. The alliance is
   a group of the industry's largest software companies,
   including Microsoft, Lotus and Novell. "But much more needs
   to be fleshed out," Mr. Holleyman said.
   One big criticism of the Clipper policy was the proviso
   that a Government agency would hold, in escrow, a decoding
   key that law-enforcement officials could obtain after
   receiving a court's authorization. The new proposal would
   still include a provision for holding keys in escrow, but
   Government officials said they were now willing to discuss
   letting non-Government escrow agents hold the keys.
   Later in September, the Government will hold a second
   workshop to discuss Federal standards for software coding
   systems that could then be used as an alternative to
   Clipper and a related technology called Capstone. In an
   attempt to establish Clipper and Capstone as de-facto
   industry standards, the original policy mandated that
   computer and communications systems sold to the Federal
   Government must contain Clipper or Capstone hardware.
   But the new approach might allow computer and
   communications companies to sell products to the Government
   that achieved the same privacy protection through software-
   only means. That would relieve companies doing business
   with the Government of the obligation to invest in Clipper
   and Capstone technologies that might not find buyers in the
   commercial marketplace.
   Another criticism of the Government s policy has been its
   longstanding export rules, which have put strict limits on
   the export of software containing data-encoding
   capabilities. The assumption has been that the Government's
   electronic spies, the National Security Agency, would be
   able to break codes with keys of 40 bits or shorter. But
   now the Government will consider allowing export of coding
   systems with keys up to 64 bits long -- on the condition
   that decoding keys be held in escrow for access by
   authorized law-enforcement officials.
   "This is definitely a compromise," said Ray Kammer, the
   deputy director of the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology. "During the past year we've had a pretty
   spirited debate about the possibility of a 64-bit software
   key-escrow system. Law enforcement people had to get used
   to the notion it might be possible to do this."
   The vulnerability of 40-bit systems was underscored two
   days ago. A French student decoded a message that had been
   encoded using the 40-bit security feature in the European
   version of the Netscape Communications Corporation software
   for navigating the Internet's World Wide Web service.
   The student, Damien Doligez, at Ecole Polytechnique, a
   French engineering and sciences college, used 120 computers
   in a campus network to simultaneously test every key
   possible in a short period. It took him eight days, but he
   was able to decode a single encoded Netscape message. Mr.
   Doligez announced his achievement on the Internet.
   Yesterday, Netscape issued a statement saying that the
   version of its software distributed in the United States
   supports 128-bit keys, which the company said would require
   more than one trillion times the computing power the French
   student used to decode the message.
   Despite the industry's tentative willingness to accept a
   key-escrow coding plan, civil liberties organizations and
   other computer experts said that escrow techniques made
   little sense in light of the fact that private individuals
   might use any kind of coding system they wished to exchange
   information domestically. Encoding systems without escrow
   keys are also widely available overseas.
   "How does key escrow accomplish what the Government has set
   out to do?" asked David Sobel, legal counsel for the
   Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington D.C.
   public interest group. "Nonescrowed encryption is out
   there," he said. "And for the concerns law and enforcement
   and intelligence have, the problem remains and it will
   remain under this policy."

      Companies hoping to start selling stronger encryption

      For instance, one unresolved issue is how to certify

      organized-crime figures out of the business. And the
      administration's emerging policy doesn't deal with
      data-security hardware -- products that wire the
      encryption schemes right into chips or other devices.
      Even with the export restrictions, U.S. officials
      haven't been able to stop widespread international
      distribution of an encryption program, called Pretty
      Good Privacy, that is nearly impossible to crack.

   Whitfield Diffie OpEd: "Washington's Computer Insecurity."
      The Federal Government has refused to allow companies to
      export strong encryption systems, insisting that
      cryptography is a military weapon. If the Administration
      does not fundamentally alter its position, it is likely
      that our high-tech industries, which sell more than half
      their products outside the country, will continue to be
      forced to sell programs with weak security systems. This
      will pave the way for foreign companies to grab what is
      expected to become a huge market for properly
      safeguarded computer communications.
   "Citibank Fraud Case Raises Computer Security Questions."
      A $10 million computer fraud against Citibank appeared
      to be the first successful penetration by a hacker into
      the systems that transfer trillions of dollars a day
      around the world's banks. New details of the case were
      disclosed as a Federal complaint was unsealed in
      Manhattan. The hackers were accused of breaking into
      Citibank's cash management system, a network that allows
      its corporate customers to transfer money to any bank
      account in the world. Banking experts said similar
      breakins were bound to occur at a time when more
      powerful personal computers are available. Since the
      break-in, Citibank has required customers to use an
      electronic device, that creates a new password for every
      transfer.

Information Week of August 28 has a cover story on

   public-key encryption algorithms and anonymous remailer
   programs." BlackNet is red-flagged. Laggard law is cited.
   "This is where all the crime will be in the 21st century,"
   says Joseph Seanor, a federal government intelligence
   veteran. "Law enforcement officials are trying to get a
   handle on it, but they really can't stop it." Seanor adds,
   "When it comes to technology, criminals always seem to be

Eye-catching quote in the Info Week story on Internet theft:
   Another threat is the growing number of information brokers
   who use online communications to match buyers and sellers.
   An increasing number of these brokers -- many of whom are
   former government intelligence employees in the United
   States and Eastern Europe -- work closely with hackers
   dealing in illicit data.
   "The biggest security problem organizations face today is
   information brokers," says Dan White, national director of
   information security at Ernst & Young in Chicago. "Since
   the end of the Cold War there have been a lot of people
   trained in espionage who don't have a lot to do."

This is a variation on Brad's forward of the MSN security
   hole:
   Information Week, August 28, 1995, p. 24.
   Risk Looms On Microsoft Network. E-mail icons can hide
   viruses.
   A feature designed to make electronic mail easy to use on
   the Microsoft Network online service may also make it
   easier for hackers to trick users into running destructive
   software programs on their PCs.
   When a Microsoft Network user sends a binary file embedded
   in an E-mail message, the file appears as an icon on the
   recipient's screen. The recipient can double-click on the
   icon to automatically download the embedded file and
   execute it. To download the file without executing it, the
   recipient must use the mouse's right button, which has been
   rarely needed until now.
   Though other online services offer automatic downloading of
   files, Microsoft's goes one step further in allowing the
   file's automatic execution. That file could be a virus or
   other malicious program that could erase files or reformat
   a hard disk, according to Mike Wyman, VP and chief
   technical offficer of Interactive Data Corp., an investment
   information firm in Lexington, Mass., and a Microsoft
   Network beta user. "On the Microsoft Network, I can
   disguise an icon so that it looks innocuous," says Wyman.
   "The analogy I like to use is the Unabomber. If you get a
   package in the mail that's wrapped in duct tape and brown
   paper, you'd regard it as suspicious. But if it's a plain
   white envelope with Ed McMahon's picture on it, you
   wouldn't think twice about opening it."
   Microsoft says the feature is a convenience, not a security
   hole. "There are risks of getting [data] off the network in
   any form," says George Meng, group product manager for the
   Microsoft Network in Redmond, Wash. "People have to be
   aware of what the source of information is."
   Winn Schwartau, president of Interpact Inc., a computer
   security consulting firm in Seminole, Fla., disagrees. "If
   the ability to execute programs bypasses conventional
   filtering and virus controls, then you certainly have a
   security hole," he says "Potential 'Trojan horse' programs
   could be sent by anyone."

      with its desire to keep its own hands clean, though it
      frames the issue in terms of national security, not

   In the wake of reports that the Clinton Administration is
   considering another Clipper-like scheme to ensure
   government access to encrypted conversations and e-mail,
   Phil Zimmermann is striking again. The 41-year-old author
   of the notorious PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software program

   release a sequel: PGPfone, which allows people to use their
   computers as secure telephones. If you have a recent
   Macintosh (a Windows verson comes next month) and a fast
   modem, you and a friend can speak in total privacy. As with
   its predecessor, Zimmermann is giving the software away,
   via MIT's Internet sites. Meanwhile, he's still waiting to
   hear whether the Feds will indict him for export violations
   in the distribution of PGP. Does Zimmermann worry that
   releasing PGPfone -- which can theoretically frustrate law-

   "C.I.A. Still in Dark on Spy's Damage."
      Eighteen months after the arrest of Aldrich H. Ames,
      Moscow's mole inside the Central Intelligence Agency,
      the agency has still not sounded the depths of the
      damage he did. The process of looking backward to
      reconstruct the past and understand the present -- the
      business of "walking back the cat," in espionage argot
      -- has proved immensely frustrating. Often he did not
      know the true names or roles of the people he betrayed.
      The Soviet (and later the Russian) intelligence services
      forced some of the men Mr. Ames betrayed to become pawns
      in a game of deception, using them to feed false
      information on some of those operations to the C.I.A. in
      an effort to mislead and mystify the agency. The C.I.A.
      became a laughing stock for the way in which it

      That new Russian subs are so quiet is attributable in

      part to help from two convicted American spies, John

The WSJ and Financial Times report today on The New
   Transatlantic Agenda, the trade and security pact signed by
   the US and Europe yesterday to "boost cooperation."
      [WSJ] The accord's center piece commits the parties to
      working together on 150 specific policy areas, including
      cutting trade barriers, strengthening cooperation in
      nuclear nonprofliferation and fighting international
      crime.
      "There are mixed urges in Europe right now," says Kirsty
      Hughes, head of the European program at the Royal
      Institute for International Affairs in London. "On one
      hand, the nations of Europe want to keep the U.S.
      involved in European affairs, and on the other, they
      want to develop their own economic, political and
      security arrangements."
   Then, the Fin Times piece, headlined "Clinton and EU
   leaders agree on crime," reports on a variety of issues but
   mentions only in passing the phrase "crime, drugs and
   terrorism."
   This treatment suggests that there is more boosting of
   security and crime-fighting cooperation than the press is
   reporting -- or privy to.
   Recall recent reports on:
      A World Trade Organization cyberspace czar to bring law
      and order to the unruly Net.

   Cooperation on trade and "crime, drugs and terrorism" might
   then be a euphemism for economic aggression -- US-EU
   international affairs arranged to maximize benefits for
   transatlantic self-interests.
   If so, then cryptography is truly a highly valuable

   Quantum Computers, Factoring, and Decoherence
   I. L. Chuang, R. Laflamme, P. W. Shor, W. H. Zurek
   [First paragraph] The uniqueness of the prime
   factorization of a positive integer is the Fundamental
   Theorem of Arithmetic. In practice, the determination of
   the prime factors of a given number can be an exceedingly
   difficult problem, even though verification is trivial.
   This asymmetry is the basis for modern cryptography and
   provides secret codes used not only on your own bank card
   but also to transfer diplomatic messages between embassies.
   [Precis] It is known that quantum computers can
   dramatically speed up the task of finding factors of large
   numbers, a problem of practical significance for
   cryptographic applications. Factors of an L-digit number
   can be found in ~L^2 time [compared to ~exp(L^1/3) time] by
   a quantum computer, which simultaneously follows all paths
   corresponding to distinct classical inputs, obtaining the
   solution from the coherent quantum interference of the
   alternatives. Here it is shown how the decoherence process
   degrades the interference pattern that emerges from the
   quantum factoring algorithm. For a quantum computer
   performing logical operations, an exponential decay of
   quantum coherence is inevitable. However, even in the
   presence of exponential decoherence, quantum computation
   can be useful as long as a sufficiently low decoherence
   rate can be achieved to allow meaningful results to be
   extracted from the calculation.

Financial Times, December 21, 1995, p. 4.
   Encryption rules to be prepared
   By Andrew Jack in Paris
   Representatives of international business and government
   yesterday agreed to draw up guidelines on encryption, a
   system which allows computer users to transmit information
   electronically with little risk that it can be intercepted
   and understood by unauthorised "hackers".
   The meeting, which was held at the International Chamber of
   Commerce in Paris, could lead to formal propositions
   prepared jointly by business and government organisations
   that could be ready by as soon as next summer.
   Yesterday's meeting did not have any formal legal
   authority, but was highly significant as the first forum
   where so many representatives of governments businesses and
   computer experts met to discuss developments in encryption.
   Highly sophisticated encryption technology already exists
   in a number of countries including the US and Sweden. In
   the US, companies already have access to these programs. A
   growing number of businesses -- led by the banking sector
   -- are demanding access to these programs.
   However, many governments, including that of the US, have
   resisted permitting the technology to be exported because
   they fear it will fall into the hands of organised crime
   and terrorist organisations.
   They have demanded that they should be able to "hack" into
   computer transmissions for counter-intelligence and
   criminal investigation work, in the same way that they can
   conduct telephone-tapping exercises.
   An important conclusion of yesterday's Paris meeting was
   that business agreed in principle to allow such hacking to
   take place as long as sufficient safeguards were in place
   and "electronic search warrants" had been issued with
   proper judicial approval.
   A number of governments appear willing to permit relaxation
   of export controls on sophisticated encryption devices as
   long as these safeguards are in place.
   Among the issues that experts on both sides need to resolve
   are the ways in which "keys" allowing computer
   transmissions to be decoded would be handled.
   A number of business organisations have discussed the use
   of third-party organisations, which would be independent of
   government, would have the keys and would hand them over to
   government investigators when demands were justified.
   However, the organisations still have to resolve a number
   of issues, including how these custodians could be made
   legally liable for any unauthorised access to this
   information and for the costs of its misuse.
   [End]
   Does anyone have press reports or more information on this    meeting? Any connection to the recently signed Transatlantic
   Agenda?

Rasping rawbutts for National Whiners Day here's a duo    of pinhole puckers about the shut-your-filthy-hole bill:
   The Wash Post, Dec 25, 1995:
   Internet Football
   The Internet provisions are still in flux along with the
   rest of the host telecommunications bill, in which this
   newspaper and its parent company have an interest. If these
   provisions go through in anything like their present form,
   then their vulnerability to challenge on First Amendment
   grounds seems clear. It makes sense for a court to sort out
   the constitutional from the technical aspects of this new
   form of "speech," and the sooner the better.
   It won't be easy. The main legal questions about the
   proposed Internet indecency regulations as they now stand
   are inextricably wound up with technical issues. Can the
   "transmitters" of material that is deemed "indecent" ensure
   to a reasonable degree of certainty that underage computer
   users cannot get to it? If they fail, how can they show
   they tried? Several ideas here are flags for trouble.
   No legally solid test exists for the "indecency" standard
   now in the regulations -- patterned on those used for
   earlier dial-a-porn legislation but addressing totally
   different technologies. The coalition of moderate conferees
   had tried to replace the term with the more explicit
   "harmful to minors" but failed by a single vote. The
   Justice Department said in a letter last week that a
   "harmful to minors" standard was more likely than
   "indecency" to pass scrutiny but that "an overly broad
   restriction would likely not withstand constitutional
   scrutiny regardless of the standard chosen."
   That brings up the meaning of "transmit." Who is
   responsible for "transmitting" a smutty text that, say, a
   high school student locates by using an ordinary commercial
   account to (1) find, download and install free software
   that searches the Web, (2) use that tool to find a
   pornographic bulletin board overseas, and (3) make a copy
   to store in his own computer?
   The regulations now would punish anyone who "uses any
   interactive computer service to display [indecent material]
   in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age."
   But the bulletin board overseas isn't subject to U.S. Iaw.
   Most likely it will be up to the commercial providers to
   demand ID for certain types of accounts -- or up to
   account-buying parents to limit the scope of their kids'
   accounts. Whether providers can actually wall off sectors
   of the electronic world without cooperation from the adults
   paying the bills has more to do with the available
   electronic gizmos than with the laws governing the world to
   which they give access.
   There is much complicated back-and-forth about whether
   providers such as America Online and Prodigy will be held
   responsible for the effectiveness of the measures they
   take. But only the courts can decide what truly works. A
   court muddled its way through the Prodigy case on this
   topic in New York State recently. It declined to modify its
   own judgment that the provider was more liable because it
   had tried to create a "PG bulletin board" than if it had
   not. Whether or not this stands, it's a measure of the
   disconnect that persists as this legislation stumbles
   toward final enaction.
   The NY Times, Dec 26, 1995:
   Mr. Hollings Saves the Phone Bill
   House and Senate conferees seemed ready to negotiate a
   damaging telecommunications compromise until Senator Ernest
   Hollings of South Carolina, the chief Senate negotiator,
   altered that destiny last week. Wielding the threat of a
   filibuster and a deft legislative hand, he rescued the best
   parts of flawed House and Senate bills passed earlier,
   added some good new ideas and threw out most of the rot.
   His draft bill could spark innovation and set off
   consumer-friendly competition among television, cable and
   telephone companies. Its biggest flaw is a heavy-handed and
   probably unconstitutional effort to ban "indecent material"
   from the Internet.
   The original bills sought to break down barriers that keep
   media companies from entering each other's markets. But
   three mistakes were made. The bills would have deregulated
   cable rates before competition by other video companies
   could protect customers from price-gouging cable operators.
   Local phone companies would have been allowed to enter the
   long-distance market before they faced competition from
   cable or other companies. Worse still, the bills would have
   allowed broadcasters, cable operators, telephone companies
   and newspapers to merge too easily. That could expose
   consumers to a frightening concentration of information
   sources.
   Mr. Hollings, with the help of key Republicans like Senator
   Larry Pressler, fixed most of these flaws. His draft bill
   would hold up entry of local phone companies into
   long-distance service until the Federal Communications
   Commission says O.K. after giving weight to an antitrust
   review by the Justice Department. The bill leaves it up to
   the F.C.C. to set reasonable guidelines for mergers. It
   would put off deregulation of most cable rates for three
   years -- enough time for phone and satellite services to
   take on cable operators.
   The one serious error is a prohibition against transmission
   of allegedly indecent materials over the Internet -- the
   network of millions of on-line computer subscribers around
   the world. The indecency standard is probably
   unconstitutionally vague and restrictive. The standard is
   also unnecessary. The law already forbids sending obscene
   materials by computer. To protect children, parents can buy
   easy-to-use programs that block indecent materials from any
   source. The draft bill threatens to trigger further
   Government control of electronic communication -- which has
   blossomed so far precisely because Government has stayed on
   the sidelines. Fortunately, Republican leaders like Speaker
   Newt Gingrich are troubled by the indecency standard. There
   is a good opportunity to knock the provision out before
   Congress takes a vote.
   Some Republicans, miffed when Vice President Al Gore
   declared the draft an Administration victory, threatened to
   withhold support. But telecommunications, the heart of a
   high-tech economy, is too important for small-minded
   sparring. Congress should take up the draft bill, remove
   the indecency provision and put Mr. Holling's good deed
   into law.
   [The coccyx of a 12-26-95 WSJ eunucher]:
   First Amendment advocates, who have criticized the bill
   because it cracks down on Internet indecency and sets up a
   rating system and show-blocking circuitry against TV
   violence, got one small gift: The bill contains a provision
   for an expedited legal review of the constitutionality of
   those provisions. On the other hand, it also sets up a new
   law allowing 10-year prison terms for anyone who, using
   interstate phone calls, mail or other means, "persuades,
   induces, entices, or coerces" a minor to engage in any
   illegal sexual act.

The New York Times
   February 3, 1995, p. A19
   [Column] On My Mind
   A. M. Rosenthal
   Jihad in America
   The Clinton Administration has come to two major
   conclusions about terrorism in America, and from America.
   The first is that the United States is becoming a
   national safe haven for terrorists from the Middle East:
   a combination bank, fund-raiser, militarist training
   ground, recruitment center, political academy and
   embarkation dock.
   Second conclusion: Do something. So one recent night,
   instructions from Washington went out to banks nationwide
   to freeze the funds of the various Hamas Hezbollah and
   Islamic Jihad units, and their clones, operating from the
   East Coast to Texas and California. Mr. Clinton did that
   by Presidential order.
   Now the Administration is asking Congress to pass new
   anti-terrorist legislation. It would enable the
   Government to trace funds to and from the
   terrorist-supporting groups, tighten the definition of
   terrorism, enlarge the powers of Federal attorneys to
   deal with it and make it illegal to plan or train for
   terrorism abroad as well as in the U.S.
   The draft legislation is called the Omnibus
   Counterterrorism Act of 1995. It was drawn up by the
   Department of Justice on Presidential order and will be
   introduced in Congress in a matter of days.
   For Americans who have been warning about terrorism
   operating in and out of America, the time to relax has
   hardly arrived. We will see how effective it is in ending
   the contribution to terrorism of American laws and
   American inattention.
   But the fact is that the Clinton Administration has begun
   to pay more attention to the growth of terrorist
   organizations here than its predecessors have. And in
   parts of the government intelligence machinery, the
   assessment of the danger of terrorism originating in
   America is strong enough to surprise even anti-terrorism
   alarm ringers like myself.
   In large part, the awakening can be credited to the
   terrorists themselves. Even for America, blowing up the
   World Trade Center was a little thick.
   But the next time you get all worked up about the
   dastardly press, do remember that in the matter of
   terrorism, as so many others, it was an American
   journalist whose skill, determination and risk-taking
   (physical and professional) helped shake government
   awake.
   On Nov. 21, 1994, PBS presented "Jihad in America." The
   documentary laid it all out on film -- the meetings in
   American cities where the cry of holy war went up against
   America, Christians, Jews and Muslims who would not
   surrender to fundamentalism; the training; the visits to
   American units by Middle Eastern leaders of Hamas and
   Islamic Jihad, and the fund-raising structure that
   supported terrorism.
   The executive producer was Steven Emerson, an
   investigator of terrorism who has turned out a strong
   body of work in film, books and print journalism. Among
   government officials I talked to, credit for Mr. Emerson
   was not only acknowledged but volunteered.
   Democracy often has a tough time defending itself because
   it has to operate step by step, inch by inch, under the
   law. Yes, of course, that is democracy's blessing and
   strength.
   But nothing says a democracy has to watch the bombers
   come racing in their trucks and pretend they are
   bicyclists out for a ride in the park. Laurie Mylroie,
   the U.S. expert on Iraq who wrote a fine best seller on
   Saddam Hussein with Judith Miller, has written another
   book, focusing on the question of an Iraqi role in the
   bombing. It deserves to be published wide and soon.
   The Emerson documentary brought protests from American
   Muslim groups. So will the new legislation. Immediately,
   non-Muslims nod sypathetically and think, well, it's
   understandable Muslims will be upset. I almost did
   myself. But why? Christians are not expected to complain
   about denunciation of Christian Fascists. Jews around the
   world led the protests of the massacre at the mosque in
   Hebron and Jews generally did not protest the President's
   freezing of funds of two extremist Jewish groups.
   The assumption that all Muslims must be angry at action
   against Muslim terrorists strengthens the killers. It
   demeans the intelligence of all Muslims. And, as for the
   hundreds of thousands of Muslim victims who died under
   Muslim state tyranny or Muslim state-supported terrorism,
   it spits on their graves.

Forwarding mail by: gleick at pipeline.com (James Gleick) on Fri, 10 Feb  0:12 AM
Dear Pipeliners,
I'm pleased to be able to tell you that the Pipeline has become part of  a larger enterprise: Performance Systems International (PSINet), the  nation's leading Internet access provider.
That means two things immediately. First, PSINet has a state-of-the-art dialup network in many cities  across the nation, and these will shortly be available to our users at  a cost much less than our current out-of-town SprintNet surcharges.
Second, PSINet plans to use our Internaut software as the basis for a  national service--not to replace the New York-based Pipeline but to  provide an alternative for out-of-towners who don't especially care  about New York information and services.
PSINet is a company a lot like ours--small (though not so small  anymore), enthusiastic, fast-moving, and steeped in Internet history.  The people there care about the Internet as an environment worth  preserving even as it grows so explosively.  And they admire what we've  accomplished here at the Pipeline in forming a model online service.
That's enough for now--there will be more information following along  behind, but I wanted you to hear it here first.  As for me--this isn't  goodbye, exactly, but I have gotten a little behind on a book I was  supposed to be writing . . .
I am deeply grateful to all of you--staff and customers--for making  the Pipeline what it is and for letting me get to know you a little bit.

Responding to msg by rishab at dxm.ernet.in () on Mon, 13 Feb  1:26 AM
The NY Times report today on the near miss of "terrorist mastermind" Yousef in Manila after a kitchen blaze of cooking-up explosives, says that he was seen walking rapidly away talking on a cellular phone.
Allegedly left behind on a laptop was a disk "filled with details of his plots to kill Pope John Paul II, and to blow up American jets flying in the Far East."
Twenty (20) FBI agents were sent to pick him up in Islamabad, Pakistan for safe home in the New York.
A concerned citizen may ask:
What was picked up from the phone, or will be affidavited to have been picked up.
What was on the disk, or will be solemnly sworn to have been found on the disk.
And, finally, what armament and intergalatic technology accompanied the SWAT team -- over and back, to provide full cloak and security on land, sea and air?  And, with that show as spoof, how was he really imported?  How many other fake transports were set in motion?
When will we learn more of the lurid Clancy-juicy details of this black-op budget-busting crowd-pleaser?
Is this a laptop dog and pony?  No offense to Fifi and Holy Bull and Apple.

It is one thing to claim First Amendment protection to shield  political speech, IMHO it is another to shield fraud and criminal  behavior.
Besides the First Amendment runs against the government, not in  favor of individuals in actions brought by private parties.  In  the sexism thread, would anyone claim that an individual has the  right to harass or stalk a person under the guise of the First  Amendment?  Would the First Amendment be a defense in a defamation  suit?  Of course not (Times v. Sullivan aside).  Doesn't an  individual have the right to know the identity of someone who is  trying to communicate with him/her on a private basis?  To a  certain extent, the question was crystallized in the caller ID  debate -- Who has the superior right, the calling party to anonymity or the called party to knowing who is calling?
One of the areas of my professional concern is the use of  cyberspace for securities fraud and manipulation.  Cyberspace is  an ideal medium for these activities because of the availability  of anonymity and pseudonymity.  Even on commercial BBSs, where  "member lists" are available, posting to these lists is voluntary  and those who draw my attention are rarely on these lists.  Does  all of cyberspace become off limits to conventional private rights  and law enforcement under the rubric of "freedom of speech and  assembly?"

The New York Times    January 10, 1995, D2.    Mastercard to Develop On-Line Standard    By Saul Hansell    Joining a stampede of companies that hope to profit from    shopping on computer networks, Mastercard International    said yesterday that it would develop standards for its    cards to be used on the Internet.    Mastercard, an association of banks that is based in New    York, said it would use the technology developed by the    Netscape Communications Corporation of Mountain View,    Calif., a specialist in software for the Internet, the    global web of computer networks.    The Internet allows a company to make information on its    products available to millions of computer users around the    world. Increasingly, companies would like to consummate    sales using the Internet as well, but the open nature of    the network may allow credit card numbers to be stolen.    "The problem with the Internet is there is no privacy and    no security," said Edward J. Hogan, a senior vice president    of Mastercard.    The Mastercard plan is one of several attempts to translate    credit card numbers into a code before they are sent to    merchants selling goods over the network and then on to the    credit card companies.    Visa International has said it will develop its own    encryption system with the Microsoft Corporation. Microsoft    has hinted that it may charge a fee for every transaction    using its system, though the details have not been    announced. Netscape and Mastercard say their transaction    standards will be openly published and free for other    companies to use.    Netscape's main business is selling software that allows    companies to publish information on the Internet. To expand    the market, it gives away or sells for a very small fee    software that allows people to view nformation on the    Internet.    The company has already included a component to encrypt    credit card numbers with its current version. The first    merchants to allow purchases using that feature will be    part of an electronic shopping service to be introduced by    the MCI Communications Corporation later this month.    The initial Netscape credit card system allows customers to    use any brand of card. It did not involve the cooperation    of credit card companies, but rather used existing rules    that related to mail and telephone card orders.    The agreement with Mastercard will for the first time allow    purchases on the Internet with automatic teller machine or    debit cards, which withdraw money from checking accounts.    Mastercard will likely agree to absorb the losses from    fraud on the system. Under the existing Netscape system,    merchants selling goods are liable if fraudulent card    numbers are used, as are companies that sell goods by mail    or telephone.    The debit card access and the fraud guarantee are expected    to be available by the fall.    End

New York Post, January 9, 1995    Front Page, pp. 8, 9. Four articles.    A Post Investigation    Computer Sickos Target Your Kids    Child-porn perverts roam info-highway    Furor Over Cybersmut    Molesters With a Modem    Kiddie-sex perverts using computers to lure victims    By Lou Lumenick and Kieran Crowley    City cops are about to start patrolling the information    superhighway to hunt down child pornographers and    pedophiles who are luring kids through high-tech computer    bulletin boards, The Post has learned.    "The bulletin boards are a total haven for pedophiles,"    said Sgt. Richard Perrine, who's forming a new computer    investigation unit.    There are no names and faces, and a 33-year-old man can    pass himself off as a 10-year-old kid." Perrine said the    new unit, in the NYPD's Organized Crime Control Bureau,    plans to include computer child-pornographers and    pedophiles among its targets.    "We haven't really solidified our strategy yet," he told    The Post.    "This is something that's so new, law enforcement is not    quite ready for it."    Law-enforcement officials say pedophiles are lurking on the    nation's three major on-line services, America Online    Prodigy and Compuserve where kiddie-sex perverts are using computers    to lure victims -- as well as on the worldwide Internet,    smaller online services, and locally-operated computer    bulletin boards.    On-line services are an easy way for pedophiles to meet    children anonymously, noted Dyanne Greer, a senior lawyer    with the National Center for the Prosecution of Child    Abuse.    "Many cases are not reported, so I'm not sure anybody is    really aware how much this is going on," she said.    A Post probe uncovered these on-line horror stories:       Westchester computer expert George Telesha pretended to be       a 14-year-old girl on America Online and was quickly       besieged by perverts sending dirty pictures.       A Manhattan computer expert allegedly got a 13-year-old New       Jersey boy he met on-line to go skating with him.       Cops said the man lured the youth into the woods near the       boy's home and sexually abused him six times between last       July and September.       An unemployed Brooklyn computer programmer tried to       sodomize a Nevada teen-ager he met on a computer bulletin       board.       A 27-year-old computer engineer in Cupertino, Calif.,       allegedly met a 14-year-old boy through America Online.       He is charged with handcuffing, shackling and blindfolding       the boy and then taking him to his apartment, where he       whipped him with a belt, shaved his pubic hair and had sex       with him.       California man sent pornographic photos via computer to a       teen-ager, then sought to have the teen killed to silence       him.    Such crimes are not easy to investigate or prosecute,    officials note.    "It's a bigger problem than most people realize," said Mike    Brick, director of the Orlando bureau of the Florida State    Office of Law Enforcement.    "There's a lot of people out there who want to have sex    with children. If they hang out at a real playground, a    teacher or someone might see them. In the computer    playground they can more or less hide in the bushes."    A handful of agencies have staffers pose as youngsters to    solicit dirty pictures and come-ons, but many don't have    the manpower, equipment or inclination to do so on a    regular basis.    And even if they did, experts say there's probably no way    to completely stop on-line perverts -- who constitute a    tiny fraction of overall on-line communicators -- short of    shutting down the services.    And that is not only unlikely, but would rob children and    others of a valuable educational resource.    The services say they're concerned -- but in no position to    play the role of police.    AOL spokeswoman Pam McGraw said computer-privacy laws keep    her company's hands tied when it comes to the    person-to-person type of communication in which porn can be    exchanged in electronic "private chat rooms."    "Federal law prevents us from monitoring E-mail," McGraw    said. "We do our best to prevent misuse of our service."    She urged AOL customers to report offensive communications    -- which are prohibited under company rules -- so the    company can warn offenders or eject them from the system.    Law-enforcement officials say on-line companies are quick    to cut off perverts and help track down and prosecute    pedophiles and pornographers.    But the crimes still flourish because computers make life    simpler for the perverts.    Pedophiles can easily pretend to be a child online, or even    someone of the opposite sex, to help draw a child into a    trap. And they can elude detection by using false names and    post office boxes.    "Offenders can say they're other kids, then arrange for    face-to-face meetings," Greer said. "It's pretty scary when    you find out you're dealing with a 47-year-old man instead    of the 14-year-old you expected."    Greer said some pedophiles have convinced children to pose    for pornographic pictures. The pedophiles then trade the    pictures with other perverts, or use the pictures to draw    in other kids "and break down their inhibitions," she said.    End Article 1    Article 2    Photo:    CREEP CATCHERS: Special agent Mike Brick (white shirt) of    the Florida state police and another agent track a    pedophile on the computer.    How to protect your children    Steps parents can take to stop on-line pedophiles    By Lou Lumenick    Parents must take the offensive to protect their children    from on-line perverts, experts say.    "You wouldn't let a young child hang out in a playground or    mall alone, so don't let them hang out in the computer    playground by themselves," said Mike Brick of the Florida    Department of Law Enforcement. "You need to exercise the    same caution."    So what can a parent do? First of all, experts say talk    with someone at your on-line system -- whether it's America    Online, Prodigy, Compuserve, Genie Delphi or one of the    others.    All of them allow users to limit access by children.    Subscribers to America Online, for instance, can bar their    children from the private "chat rooms," where the more    sexually explicit conversations take place.    Most services will also allow you to disable one-on-one    conversations when your child logs on.    Then talk with your children.    Rule No. 1 is that they must never ever give their real    name, address or telephone number to anyone on-line.    Rule No. 2 is that they must never ever agree to meet with    anyone they encounter on-line -- even if he says he's a kid    the same age who lives across the street. He could very    well be an adult willing to travel hundreds of miles for a    sexual encounter.    Beyond that, it's a matter of parental vigilance.    "Make the kids teach you how to use the computer," said    Dyanne Greer, a senior lawyer with the National Center for    the Prosecution of Child Abuse.    "Many parents take the attitude, 'Gee, my kids are learning    a skill.' That's very true, but you can't be left behind or    you won't know what's going on.    Many experts recommend moving the computer out of the kids'    bedroom into a more central place -- like the living room    -- so parents can keep a closer eye on things.    "If your kid wants to put the computer in his bedroom    closet, I would be very nervous," Brick said.    "If you find your children spending a lot of time on the    service, you need to pay attention. "If every time you walk    into the room, the screen goes dark, check it out. It could    be the modern equivalent of kids under the cover with a    flashlight reading Uncle Harry's Playboy magazine. Or    worse."    Brick said telltale signs of porn being downloaded include:    "If you have a 100-megabyte drive and it's always full and    the kids are demanding more memory. Photos can take a lot    of memory. "    "If you find floppy disks hidden around the house."    "If you need help playing them or figuring out whether    there's a problem, go to your local police department. Most    will be happy to help."    End Article 2    Article 3    Chilling messages made dad take action    By Kieran Crowley    George Telesha couldn't believe his ears. Or his modem.    Telesha, 46, a bank computer specialist and president of    the Westchester chapter of the Fathers Rights Association,    heard from several dads that their kids were accessing porn    on their home computers.    So he decided to take a walk on the wild side -- on the    information superhighway.    Telesha, the father of two, pretended to be a 14-year-old    girl named "Suzy" on an America Online computer bulletin    board.    He said he was besieged with perverts who sent dirty    pictures.    Telesha said several men sent "Suzy" porno pictures, tried    to get her address and phone number -- and tried to lure    her out of her home.    "Can I come up to New York?" one out-of-state man said.    "Can I meet you? You don't have to tell your parents."    When "Suzy" mentioned her parents were not home, another    man became very insistent, Telesha said.    "I live in New York. Can I come over? I'll take you    shopping," the man messaged "Suzy" in trying to set up a    date at a local mall.    One man said he lived in New Jersey and invited "Suzy" over    for a photo session.    Telesha said his most disturbing exchange was with a man    who sent child sex pictures.    "Do you have any more of these?" Telesha asked.    "Usually, it's just one session," the man typed back.    "That sent chills through me," said Telesha, fearing the    photographed children may have been harmed.    "It's mind-boggling. I haven't slept in a week. What    happened to the children in these pictures? What is going    to happen to them?"    One AOL subscriber even offered hints on how to pick up    young girls and take pornographic pictures of them Telesha    said.    "I think people ought to know what's going on. I just want    to see it stopped," he said.    End Article 3    [Article 4 reports on exchanges between Telesha    masquerading as three different girls and AOL subscribers.     Too disgusting to post.  Censorship imposed for lurking    kiddies.]

@_subject: WSJ on CIA Dump 
The Wall Street Journal    January 18, 1995, p. A14.    Get Smart -- Eliminate the CIA    By Angelo Codevilla    Over the past several years, U.S. intelligence agencies in    general and the CIA in particular have proved themselves    incompetent in peacetime and of little use in conflict.    Stripped of their mystique and lacking the capacity to    reform themselves, these organizations are virtually in    receivership.    The maladies ailing the intelligence community are    numerous. Independent quality control was never more than    a pretense, and competition among intelligence agencies was    nonexistent. Producers of intelligence -- rather than the    soldiers and diplomats who have to use it -- have also    become its judges. All this has spawned a complex of    habits, procedures, mentalities and people too entrenched    to be repaired and too noxious for any part to form the    nucleus of a new, healthy system. Hence, we should take    Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's advice, and rethink our    intelligence from the ground up.    A good place to start is with the fact that about half of    the $28 billion U.S. intelligence budget pays for units    directly controlled by military commanders, which routinely    provide precise information for the armed forces'    operations close to the front lines. The Treasury and State    Departments also have their own intelligence units, which    fit their needs quite well. So why do we need a national    system headed by the CIA?    The original justification for the creation of the CIA in    1947 was that intelligence would be best if its gathering    and evaluation were divorced as much as possible from the    operating departments of government -- State, Defense, etc.    -- and placed under the president. This judgment has turned    out to be wrong. Because presidents have relied on the CIA    to run the system, the result has been a system dominated    by the priorities of the producers -- not the users -- of    intelligence.    A basic failing is that the CIA has primary responsibility    for intelligence and none at all for real world events. The    CIA prefers to place its career employees in U.S.    embassies, where they pretend to be employees of other    parts of the government. Such "case officers" must    acknowledge that they are gathering information for the    U.S. Another disadvantage is that they don't speak foreign    languages well.    And unlike successful reporters, they virtually never know    the substantive fields about which they are seeking    information. Thus it is unsurprising that they are usually    outdone in economic reporting by economic reporters, in    military reporting by military reporters, and so forth.    The Aldrich Ames case shows how much more highly the CIA    values the smooth functioning of its system than what the    system produces. Mr. Ames handed the KGB the capacity to    shape the intelligence flowing to top U.S. officials during    the endgame of the Cold War. Thus disinformation made    presidents and secretaries of state more vulnerable to    Gorbomania than the average citizen informed by newspaper    accounts.    How could the CIA fail to notice the fishiness of reports    generated by a network controlled by the other side? The    same way that, in the 1970s and 1980s, the agency had    failed to notice that it was passing along reports from a    network of agents in Cuba totally controlled by Castro's    DGI, and from a network in East Germany all but a few of    whose agents were working for the Stasi. In other words,    while the Ames case was unusually destructive, it was a    typical example of bureaucratic sclerosis.    In the Gulf War, intelligence worsened the farther one got    away from the front lines. The national system headed by    the CIA misperceived the nature of Saddam Hussein's regime,    failed to grasp the obvious signs of attack, and has yet to    learn Saddam's military and political reasoning. Our    imaging satellites failed to find mobile Scud launchers,    and our communications intelligence antennas failed to shed    light on the diplomatic intercourse between Saddam and the    Soviets. National analysts misjudged Iraq's nuclear    program, and were fooled by elementary camouflage. Gen. H.    Norman Schwarzkopf's public belittling of CIA-run    intelligence was matched by unprintable epithets from field    commanders.    What happened in the Gulf would have happened in any    conflict because the intelligence community's cameras and    antennas were conceived, and its people trained, on the    CIA's assumption that cooperative competition with the    Soviet Union would last forever and that the basic designs    of weapons would not change. Thus cameras, for example,    were optimized to take pictures of fixed installations    rather than to keep track of attacking military forces or    mobile missile launchers.    Long before the Soviet collapse, however, it had become    clear that the CIA made bad bets. The age of mobile    missiles arrived long ago, and modern weapons are  defined    by the software they contain rather than by observable    features. So what's the point of, for example, analyzing a    radar signal that a computer can change in an instant?    Divorce from operational responsibility also tends to make    the reports that flow to top officials less valuable than    the information used to compile them. (In any given    subject, the CIA delivers a consensus of the system's    several agencies. It takes far more time for a paper to go    through the interagency process than for someone to write    the paper. Considering the elementary errors and ignorance    that often come out, it is clear that the conferees do not    spend much time fact-checking. Intelligence analysts become    spin doctors, concerned not with facts but with pushing    policy makers in the direction of their parent agencies'    prejudices. Hence the ultimate irony: A system whose    ostensible reason for being was to eliminate from    intelligence the parochial interests of tank drivers,    diplomats, bomber pilots, etc. ended up aggregating the    prejudices of the analysts -- prejudices unrelieved by the    sobering prospect of having to carry out the policies they    are pushing for.    The CIA has maintained a monopoly on judging the quality of    the system's operations and products. It does not heed    presidents, much less their appointees. A decade ago, the    agency ignored President Reagan's executive order to    reorganize counterintelligence. Two decades ago, President    Ford, shocked by how far intelligence estimates were    diverging from reality, asked a group of distinguished    outsiders (the B team) to see whether the intelligence    community's data on Soviet nuclear forces could support    conclusions different from those of the insider analysts.    The B Team, despite resistance from the agency, came up    with results far superior to the insider A Team's.    A better intelligence system should be built on a model    radically different from the 1947 original. Each of the    major departments of the U.S. government (State, Defense,    etc.) should be responsible for gathering and evaluating    the information it needs to operate in the new world    disorder. Intelligence, in short, should be franchised out    to its consumers. There is reason to believe that the    departments would do better without the ClA's tutelage than    with it. In the past, the armed forces have asked to deploy    officers who speak foreign languages, who could blend in    with the local population, and who would be experts in the    military fields on which they were reporting. U.S. military    leaders have also clamored for satellites whose products    they could use. Each time, the CIA made sure such requests    were denied. If those requests had been granted, the    country would be better informed.    In all this there is a need for some central coordination.    The several agencies have to mesh their quest for agents    abroad, lest they stumble over each other. The information    that any part of the government collects must be available    to properly cleared people in all other parts, so that any    and all analysis can be based on all the facts.    Fortunately, maintaining a central registry nowadays    requires computers, rather than the bureaucratic monster    that arose a half century ago.    Finally the president of the United States' own    intelligence needs should be provided by his own staff.    Among its duties should be to make sure that all the    agencies get each others' estimates. The availability to    the president and other top decision makers of contrasting    estimates from through out the government would stimulate    better performance all around. So, while there is a role    for a central intelligence agency in a system based on    consumer sovereignty, there is none for the CIA.

Commenting on Tim's comment about the decline of the guilds of "licensed
professionals" (I'm a licensed architect long-time arguing against the
breed's conceits and camouflages and irresponsibilities): Here in NYC there is a new trial policy to allow architects and engineers
to "self-certify" their construction documents as in compliance with the
building code rather than being approved by a municipal examiner. Over decades a sub-species has grown called "code consultants" or
"expediters", which advises and processes documents for A-E's who have
become ignorant of the arcana of the building code.  This group of several
hundred, has pretty muchly dominated, by default or by design, the
non-governmental side of construction through their specialized knowledge
of the code, procedures, interpretations, regulations and who to see for
favorable treatment in the Building Department. A-E's used these folks with happiness, usually, for it relieved the
self-certified high-minded animals to concentrate on the important stuff of
design and schmoozing and puffing feathers. On the municipal side, agency employees found that it was easier to deal
with these consultants than contrary professionals.  And, the culture
welcomed ex-public officials into their well-paid ranks to lubricate the
wheels. An odd result so far is that while owners and professionals like the idea
of speeding up the process they are reluctant to take on the concomitant
responsibility for deficiencies in meeting code standards in final
construction.  The city will inspect 20% to keep tabs. Both fear that they do not know the code well enough to take the risk of
being found at fault by random municipal inspections of construction. A-E's dread the liability and blame by owners for well-known construction
corner-cutting, and owners suspect their professionals competency and
ethics -- afraid that the pros will certify in ignorance or cupidity and
that the owners will face costly corrections without having the traditional
scapegoat of over-weening government to justify cheating in the field. The code consultants I've talked to say they wait for the animals
frightened of their own shadows to return to the safe stables.  Perhaps "code consultants" precurse the trajectory of cryptographers?

The New York Times    January 25, 1995, p. A9.    [Excerpts]    Clinton Orders Assets of Suspected Terrorist Groups Frozen    By Douglas Jehl    Washington, Jan. 24 -- Seeking to underscore an American    commitment to the fight against terrorism, President    Clinton today issued an executive order intended to cut off    the flow of funds from United States citizens to    organizations suspected of terrorist activities in Israel    and other countries.    Mr. Clinton's directive orders American financial    institutions to search for and immediately freeze any    accounts held in the names of Hamas, Islamic Holy War and    10 other organizations, and 18 of their top leaders.    It also forbids financial transfers from the United States    to those groups and individuals and will seek to prevent    them from gaining access to donations made to charitable    causes in the Middle East.    Administration officials said it was too soon to know    whether any assets would be uncovered.    While today's announcement at the White House emerged from    an Administration review concluding that the United States    could do more to limit terrorists' access to money, aides    to Mr. Clinton acknowledged that the timing had been    largely dictated by the quest for a tough-worded    centerpiece to the State of the Union address.    The aides said Mr. Clinton intended to use the speech in    part to demonstrate his commitment to preserving foreign    policy gains in the Middle East against those who would    scuttle peace efforts.    Even if the groups identified today do not hold accounts in    their names, the officials said the directive could give    the Government more power to block and deter transfers to    them -- even when those are disguised as contributions to    charity.    "It is not foolprooof," a senior Administration official    said at a White House briefing this afternoon. "It is    capable of being circumvented through a variety of    strategems." But another official said the measures could    "essentially sever the lifeline that keeps these    organizations going."    ***    A statement issued by three major American Islamic    organizations warned that the initiative could "have a    negative impact on legitimate political expression by    American Muslims and others."    But advocates of the plan said it represented no more than    a first step, even though Administration officials said    they would need to see further evidence that charitable    contributions were being used to support terrorist    operations before the Government would seek to block    operations by Muslim and Islamic groups active in raising    money in the United States.    Administration officials say that much of that money is    used for legitimate purposes in building mosques, providing    food and milk and otherwise helping Palestinian communities    like the ones in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.    But State Department officials have said that millions of    dollars a year from the United States ends up in the hands    of militants in the Hamas organizatlon, whose total    spending is estlmated by Israeli officlals at $30 million    a year and they said a test of the initiative would be    whether it could cut back that flow.    For now, the names of groups and individuals whose assets    are to be frozen or blocked unaer Mr. Clinton's order reads    like a who's who list of organzations and people identified    as terrorists.    In addition to Hamas and Islamic Holy War, they include the    Palestine Liberation Front and its leader, Mohammed Abul    Abbas -- also known as Abu Abbas --  as well as the two    rival factions of the Popular Front for the Liberation of    Palestine.    The list also includes two militant Jewish organizations,    Kach and Kahane Chai, which were spawned by Rabbi Meir    Kahane and were outlawed by Israel early last year.    The authority that Mr. Clinton invoked today in blocking    the assets is provided to the President under the    International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which was used    by President Carter to freeze Iranian assets when Americans    were being held hostage in Teheran.    But the White House made clear that Mr. Clinton intended to    ask Congress soon for even more sweeping authority to curb    terrorism, including wider powers to use wiretapping and    swift deportation procedures against suspects.    ----------    End    The New York Times    January 25, 1995, p. B6.    Head of the F.B.I.In New York Resigns    After a year as the head of the Federal Bureau of    Investigation's New York office, William A. Gavin said    yesterday that he was leaving for an executive post with a    medical-care company.    Mr. Gavin, 53, said he would retire in March as a deputy    assistant F.B.I. director to join U.S. Healthcare, in Blue    Bell, Pa, one of the country's largest health maintenance    organizations. The F.B.I. has a mandatory retirement age of    57.    Last January, Louis J. Freeh, the F.B.I. director, named    Mr. Gavin to run the office at an annual salary of    $130,000. But he was not promoted to the title of assistant    director, the rank normally given to the agency's top    manager in New York, one of the agency's most prestigious    assignments.    An agent and supervisor for 27 years, Mr. Gavin was in    charge of the investigations that led to the convictions of    four men for the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and    the indictments of 12 other men accused of plotting to blow    up the trade center and other New York Iandmarks. The 12    defendants are currently on trial in Federal District Court    in Manhattan.    Law-enforcement officials said yesterday that James    Kallstrom, a supervisory agent in New York, was considered    the most likely candidate to be chosen by Mr. Freeh to take    over the office. Mr. Kallstrom is now in charge of special    operations, the unit responsible for the surveillance and    the electronic monitoring of criminal suspects.    ----------    End

The New York Times    January 26, 1995, p. C17    Books of the Times    Kids or Conspirators: How Hackers Got Caught    MASTERS OF DECEPTION     The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace    By Michelle Slatalla and Joshua Quittner     225 pages. HarperCollins Publishers. $23.    By Chirstopher Lehmann-Haupt    It's difficult to feel much besides amused admiration for    the computer hackers spotlighted in "Masters of Deception:    The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace," by Michelle Slatalla and    Joshua Quittner, a married couple who are reporters for    Newsday. After all, what mainly characterizes the gang of    adolescents they write about is high intelligence, infinite    resourcefulness and boundless curiosity.    Among the Masters of Deception, as the gang is called,    there is Paul Stira, nicknamed Scorpion, who as a child    learned to program a computer even before he had his hands    on one and went on to master the art of cracking    computer-game copy-protection codes. Mark Abene, a k a    Phiber Optik, was so driven to understand how machines work    that he explored and mastered the most sophisticated of the    telephone company's computers.    Eli Landopoulos, or Acid Phreak, after helping lure Phiber    Optik away from a rival cyberspace gang, Legion of Doom,    was moved to write "The History of MOD" for other hackers    to envy. And John Lee, or Corrupt, found computer hacking    a better way to survive than running with a street gang.    It is difficult for the reader of this book to look upon    these and other members of the gang as criminals. Yet they    were eventually charged by a New York grand jury with    conspiring to "gain access to and control of computer    systems in order to enhance their image and prestige among    computer hackers," among other counts. And they ended up    pleading guilty and serving jail terms, which they have    completed.    In telling their stories, Ms. Slatalla and Mr. Quittner    have almost as hard a time finding a continuous thread as    the Government did building a coherent case against the    hackers. The authors begin by describing a crash of the    AT&T long-distance system that occurred on Jan. 15 1990.    The authors write of the gang's reaction to this crisis:    "No self-re-specting computer hacker would ever destroy    anything. No hacker would ever purposely hurt the phone    system. Paul just wanted to look around. He just wanted to    learn more. He'd know it if he'd done something bad.    Wouldn't he?"    The lively narrative then backtracks to tell how the    hackers formed their gang the previous year. This sequence    creates the impression that the gang will turn out to have    caused the crash, an expectation that is buttressed by    other evidence that Ms. Slatalla and Mr. Quittner describe.    The boys crashed smaller systems they invaded, like the    Learning Link, a collection of electronic bulletin boards    for educators and librarians that is owned by Channel    13/WNET, New York City's public broadcasting television    station.    The gang left the message "Happy Thanksgiving you turkeys,    from all of us at MOD," which prevented access to the    bulletin board's files. As the authors write, "the Learning    Link crash would become the pivotal event in the case that    the Federal Government was slowly building against the boys    in MOD." The process was slow because the investigators had    to weigh the need for evidence against the risk of damage.    As the authors write: "It was kind of like having a    tarantula crawl up your leg. If you shook it off too fast,    it would escape into the wall. But if you waited too long,    you got bitten."    But when, about half way through the book, the narrative    arrives back at the AT&T crash of 1990, we learn that the    failure was traced not to anything the hackers did but to    what the author's describe as "a routine update of the AT&T    software." True the gang did much that was wrong like    creating and using unbillable telephone accounts,    trespassing in cyberspace to make long-distance calls,    looking up private information and using it to harass other    hackers and stealing and selling other people's credit card    numbers.    In short, certain members crossed the line between hacking    and cracking and thereby violated the hacker ethic, which    holds, in the authors' words: "Thou shalt not destroy. It's    O.K. to look around, but don't hurt anything. It's good    enough just to be here."    Yet the fact remains that the gang did not cause the AT&T    crash. And the worst that was done appears to have happened    at a remove from what Mr. Abene was responsible for and    after Mr. Stira had more or less withdrawn from hacking.    Yet these two received the stiffest sentences. Mr. Abene,    the last to complete his sentence, was released in the fall    of last year. So one has the impression that what mattered    to the Government was less the mischief done than the    potential for mischief.    What the slightly jumbled narrative does capture    effectively is the contrast between the manic glee of the    hackers at the prospect of a vast new unexplored world to    conquer, and the Government's nervous disapproval and    understandable need to set limits on a mysterious new    frontier. The authors try to present both points of view.    They don't reveal where their sympathies lie until the last    line of their book. Here, after describing the meeting of    a hackers' club as "the milling clumps of boys" who "are    the picture of entropy, of disorganization, of isolated    growing pains and undeveloped social skill," they write    with tongue in cheek as their concluding paragraph:    "This is the conspiracy."

On this I was of course totally wrong:
Unix has symbolic debugging equal to DOS/Windows.
I was under the false impression that it only had
C code interpretation.
This is an error -- what I said was true for C++, but then in Windows we too are forced to primarily use
interpretation to debug C++.   C++ symbolic debuggers
are not up to acceptable capabilities in either system.
But my statement concerning internationalization and
resource files was correct.
Unix has no equivalent of App Studio, etc.  I have made
a little tour of people in my company who work on both
unix and Windows.  I (fortunately) work primarily on
Windows, as you may have guessed.
The company I presently work for is making a tool they
call Window Painter.  This is in some respects similar
to App Studio.  It works with their unix database But it is no App Studio, as the unix folk who are
working on it freely admit, those few of them that
have used App Studio.
Most of my correspondents had replies along the lines
of "Huh -- internationalization -- what source code
tools could possibly help you with internationalization."
Others listed irregular bands of random unix tools which
are essentially irrelevant to the problem of Most international unix programs have string files
that the compiled program refers to a string by a number, and
a font size by a number, and the position of the button
on screen by a number -- site customizable information,
Xdefaults, *.cfg
This is functionally equivalent to the Windows Resource
file, in that in principle one can keep translatable elements
separate from source code.  But is certainly not equivalent in ease of use.  One can do the job, but in essense one
does it by hand.
Resource files, and dialog box editing tools such as App Studio,
provide a clean separation between visual user interface
elements that typically require translation, and functiona
code that does not.

John Markoff writes today on security expert Tsutomu Shimomura, the target
of the break-in Markoff wrote about on Monday. For email copy send blank message with subject:  TSU_shi Here's an excerpt:    Mr. Shimomura, one of the country's most skilled computer    security experts, is the person who prompted a Government    computer agency to issue a chilling warning on Monday.    Unknown intruders, the agency warned, had used a    sophisticated break-in technique to steal files from Mr.    Shimomura's own well-guarded computer in his home near San    Diego. And the stealth and style of the attack indicated    that many of the millions of computers connected to the    global Internet network could be at risk. There have been    at least four other known victims so far, including    computers at Loyola University of Chicago, the University    of Rochester and Drexel University in Philadelphia.    Since Monday, as the F.B.I. has continued to investigate    the crime and look for evidence of break-ins elsewhere, Mr.    Shimomura has been answering telephone calls and E-mail    from government, corporate and university computer    administrators seeking advice on how to arm themselves.    Between replies, he has been working feverishly to perfect    a new type of protective software that would thwart the    burglars. Once it is finished, he intends to distribute the    software free over the Internet.    But more than anything else, Mr. Shimomura, who is 30,    wants to help the Government catch the crooks. And while he    acknowledges that the thieves were clever, Mr. Shimomura    has also uncovered signs of ineptitude that he says will be    the intruders' eventual undoing.    "Looks like the ankle-biters have learned to read technical    manuals," Mr. Shimomura said derisively. "Somebody should    teach them some manners. "

@_subject: NYT on Fermat Proof 
A long article (16k) today on Dr. Andrew Wiles's dramatic, successful
struggle to close the gap in his proof of Fermat's last theorem. For email copy send blank message to  with subject: FERM_hak Here are excerpts:    Fermat's last theorem which has tantalized mathematicians    for more than 350 years, has at last been solved, say those    who have read the revised but not yet published proof. But    the endgame of this furious chase has proved as full of    last-minute surprises as a murder mytery.    For Dr. Andrew Wiles of Princeton University, the chief    author of the proof, triumph had to be snatched from the    jaws of disaster. His first proof, which aroused world-wide    attention when announced two years ago, turned out to    contain a gap, which Dr. Wiles found he was unable to cross    alone.    ***    But he went back to the Flach method for one last time.    "There was one variant in the original argument that I'd    convinced myself wouldn't work but I hadn't convinced him,"    Dr. Wiles said. "I was sitting at my desk one morning    really trying to pin down why the Flach method wasn't    working when, in a flash, I saw that what was making it not    work was exactly what would make a method I'd tried three    years before work. It was totally unexpected. I didn't    quite believe it." He dashed down from the attic to tell    his wife. Although his enthusiasm was infectious, Dr. Wiles    said, " I actually think she didn't believe me."    ***    Dr. Wiles said that the breakthrough came in figuring out    how to glue together an infinite collection of mathematical    objects called Hecke rings. He had initially been creating    what was "a very natural relationship between these objects    -- natural in the sense that you can give a clear    definition of the maps between them." It was an inductive    argument. The idea was to take one element of a set and use    that to find the next element, then to use the second to    construct a third, and so on.    The new idea, Dr. Wiles said, "was to simply construct    artificial maps between these objects."    "You wouldn't show a relationship explicitly," he said, but    would use a counting argument to prove that a relationship    had to exist. The basic idea is to use the pigeonhole    principle: if you have more objects than pigeonholes to put    them in, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more    than one object.    The complete argument involves creating an infinite    sequence of sets of pigeonholes and then showing that there    must be objects that show up in every set of pigeonholes.    This allowed.Dr. Wiles and Dr. Taylor to prove that there    must be an infinite set of Hecke rings that share a    relationship, although they never have to specify exactly    what that relationship is.

   "U.S. Tells How It Found Soviets Sought A-Bomb: Discloses
   Clues That Led to Code-Breaking."
      The American intelligence establishment today unveiled
      one of its oldest secrets: how a small team of
      codebreakers found the first clues that the Soviet Union
      sought to steal the blueprints for the atomic bomb in
      World War II.  Using just brain power -- no computers,
      no stolen skeleton keys -- the cryptographers slowly
      cracked what was thought to be an unbreakable code.       Their work and the fact that they had broken the
      Soviets' seemingly impenetrable cipher, was until today
      one of the most tightly held secrets of the National
      Security Agency, the nation's electronic eavesdropping
      service.  The messages were like a jigsaw puzzle with a
      billion pieces -- all black. They had been double-coded

                Administration, Congress Introduce
                  New Computer Crime Legislation
   Washington, D.C. -- Attorney General Janet Reno today
   announced that the Clinton Administration, along with
   Senators John Kyl, Patrick Leahy, and Charles Grassley has
   introduced legislation dramatically increasing federal
   protections of data confidentiality.  Current law protects
   the confidentiality of financial information.  Today's
   legislation would protect all government data against
   access without permission, as well as criminalizing access
   by government employees who exceed their authority to gain
   access to government data.
   "As technology advances, computer crime has grown," said
   Reno. "We have to ensure that the law keeps up with
   changing times."
   With the phenomenal growth of legitimate computer use has
   come a similar growth in computer crime and the problem of
   "hackers" who break into computer networks without
   authority to steal information or damage computer systems.    In addition to penetrating telephone networks to disrupt
   phone service and wiretap calls, many hackers attack
   government and private computers to steal valuable
   information.
   According to the Computer Emergency Response Team at
   Carnegie Mellon University, during the past four years, the
   number of reported intrusions on the Internet has increased
   498 percent, and the number of computer sites affected has
   increased 702 percent.
   "Computer crime is fast becoming everyone's problem," said
   Reno. "I'm encouraged that this bill is off to a bipartisan
   start, and I hope Congress will move quickly to enact it."
   The new Act provides three new tools to address this
   problem:
   +  More computers would be protected by federal law.  Under
      the new law, a "protected computer" would be defined as
      any government computer, financial institution computer,
      or any other computer used in interstate or foreign
      commerce or communications.  Under current law,
      computers are not adequately protected from foreign
      hackers, and no federal jurisdiction can be obtained
      when the hacker's and the victim's computers are located
      in the same state.
   +  Under the new law, all government data would be
      protected, and the federal government could prosecute
      individuals who access government data for their own
      use.  Additionally, private data would be protected when
      hackers steal information from computers located across
      state or national borders. Currently, only financial
      data and classified information are strictly protected
      from improper access.
   +  The integrity and availability of data would be better
      protected under the new law because it ensures that all
      hackers are punished adequately.  Current law provides
      penalties for intentional damage, but hackers who
      recklessly or accidently damage information or systems
      face little or no penalties.

Garry Wills, the historian, writes a thought-provoking essay    The New York Review of Books, August 10, 1995, on "The New
   Revolutionaries," about the militants and the political and
   social grievances that undergird their movement -- many of
   which are shared, Will states, by a wide spectrum of the
   populace discontented with the government:
      The suspicion that government has become the enemy of
      freedom, not its protector, crosses ideological lines.
      Liberals point to FBI plots against American citizens
      like Dr. King, to CIA experiments with LSD on American
      citizens, to the Defense Department's use of Americans
      as guinea pigs in nuclear testing. The right sees
      assaults on liberty from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
      and Firearms, the Department of the Interior, the
      Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Many
      people resent the fact that government has become a
      dictator of the terms of societal conduct -- in welfare
      programs, in affirmative action and other preferential
      attitudes toward citizens' rights, in schools that seem
      to have a "multicultural" or antireligious agenda, in
      confiscatory taxation, in the keeping of elaborate files
      on citizens' activities, in various agencies'
      surveillance techniques and bribing of informers.
   Wills goes on to review these grievances:
      Taxation.
      The jury system.
      Regulations.
      Police power.
      Schools.
      Family.
      Religion.
      Citizen militias.
      Constitutionalism.
      Corruption.
      Guns -- discussed at length.
   And, he summarizes in closing:
      With the end of the cold war, the justification for
      government activism has been taken away. If the
      government is only good for fighting Communists, and it
      no longer fights Communists, then what good is it? No
      convincing answer comes from above -- which lends the
      answer from the depths its new plausibility: It is good
      for nothing, and citizens must take their own lives in
      hand again, vindicating their own liberties. Right or
      wrong, the armed patriots at least have arguments they
      can believe in wholeheartedly. They take the mood of
      post-cold war drift, of Perotista resentment, of
      disillusionment and economic shakiness, of fin de siecle
      fear, and change it into a plan for doing something
      about one's gripes.
      The militias and their supporters are
      not the most central social symptom of our time, but
      they are among the more dramatic symptoms of a general
      crisis of legitimacy. The authority of government can no
      longer be assumed. It has to be justified from the
      ground up.
      Many people who are not militants or conspiratorialists
      can agree with parts of this analysis. Libertarians
      wonder why people who keep to themselves should be
      bothered.
      It is no longer so "extreme" to believe that our
      government is the greatest enemy to freedom. We see this
      in a new hatred of government agents (who fear for their
      lives in western states). Or in the unprecedented
      vilification of the head of our government. The fierce
      contempt for Hillary Rodham Clinton, for the Attorney
      General (called "Butch" Reno on bumper stickers), for
      "Condom Queen" Joycelyn Elders, reflects misogyny
      rebelling against feminism's gains; but it is also a
      sign that the office of the presidency itself may now
      incur a contempt as routine as the respect it once
      commanded. The heaping of filth on the personnel and
      symbols of government has a delegitimating effect in
      itself; and the assault is joined to the disillusion,
      anger, and disorientation that have marked recent
      electoral behavior. Where the heated deny legitimacy and
      the cool are doubtful of it, a crisis is in the making.

The New York Times, July 28, 1995, p. A26.
   [Editorial] Senator Grassley's Surf Police
   An academic study suggesting that the Internet is awash in
   bestiality, pedophilia and other kinky sex turns out to
   have been seriously flawed. Politicians like Senator
   Charles Grassley who waved the study around as an argument
   for intrusive regulation have stopped doing so. But Mr.
   Grassley and his allies have not backed off from their
   drive to draft unnecessary legislative restrictions on
   computer communications. Earlier this summer, Senator James
   Exon attached an amendment to the Senate version of a
   telecommunications bill that would impose Federal penalties
   on those who made available material deemed unsuitable for
   children.
   The unreliable study that did much to spur this bad
   legislating was conducted by Marty Rimm, then an
   undergraduate at Carnegie-Mellon University. It was
   reprinted in the Georgetown Law Journal and served as the
   basis for a credulous Time magazine article early this
   month. Mr. Rimm's academic supervisors have since made
   clear that the study had serious defects. The likelihood
   that children will be accidentally deluged with sexually
   charged computer graphics is much smaller than Mr. Rimm and
   his promoters suggested.
   Furthermore, to the extent that any problem exists, the
   best response is not through heavyhanded, constitutionally
   dubious legislation but parental education and
   discretionary user controls.
   Mr. Rimm's study looked at the computer habits of adults.
   He focused not on generally accessible areas of the
   Internet but on separate, commercial adult bulletin board
   services that require special procedures to find and use.
   This, critics note, is like visiting an adult bookstore and
   using the percentage of gamey titles to generalize about
   the contents of all bookstores. He also looked, less
   carefully, at specialized areas of the Internet that would
   be hard to stumble upon by accident.
   By Mr. Rimm's own calculations, less than 1 percent of all
   material on the Internet itself is raunchy, although this
   tiny percentage is unusually popular among the adults he
   surveyed. Another Carnegie-Mellon study, focusing on
   families with high school children, suggests that sexually
   explicit material is much less popular among these users.
   To be sure, sexually explicit material that would be
   offensive to some users can be found on the Internet. It is
   within the reach of computer-literate children using the
   networks without parental supervision.
   But the problem is being exaggerated to create a pretext
   for restricting the material available to adult users of
   computers. Some members of Congress, out of political greed
   or ignorance, want to censor what can be put on the Net and
   prosecute those who post legal but raunchy material. The
   approaches being advocated by Mr. Exon and Mr. Grassley are
   unwarranted and unconstitutional.
   They are also impractical. Material posted to the Internet
   in foreign countries, beyond the reach of American law, is
   as available to users as domestically posted material.
   Items can also be posted through anonymous mailers that
   make it impossible to identify the original source.
   Censorship would also have the unwelcome effect of
   restricting adults to reading and viewing material deemed
   suitable for children, and would stunt the future of the
   networks as a medium for artistic expression.
   Parents who want to restrict what their children are able
   to call up on their computers can avail themselves of
   software now available on the market that can block out
   unwanted material. Filtering out such material at the user
   end is a more practical, and far less objectionable,
   approach than limiting a nation of computer users to baby
   talk.
   Such devices are not foolproof, of course. The surest
   defense is for parents to try to teach their children the
   kind of healthy values that would make them uninterested
   in, or immune to, sexually exploitative material.

Responding to msg by jlasser at rwd.goucher.edu (Jon Lasser) on Mon, 31 Jul 12:43 PM
In addition to Doctorow's OpEd piece, there have been three recent NYPaper articles on the case and a half-page ad.
Here's a judicious benchwarmer from the July 30 article:
   Judge Albert F. Sabo of Common Pleas Court, who conducted
   Mr. Abu-Jamal's first contentious trial, is presiding over
   his hearing for a new trial, and defense lawyers contend
   that not much has changed.
   Judge Sabo, a retired member of the Fraternal Order of
   Police, has sent more people to death row than any judge in
   the state. In the current hearing he has been openly
   contemptuous of the defense.
   "Objection is over-ruled, whatever it was," the judge told
   Mr. Abu-Jamal's lead lawyer, Leonard I. Weinglass, a
   veteran of some of the most politically charged trials of
   recent decades, including that of the Chicago Eight after
   the 1968 Democratic Convention.
   Judge Sabo has sustained virtually every prosecution
   objection while shooting down almost every defense
   objection. At one point, when Mr. Weinglass asked for a
   four-minute recess to locate a crucial witness, Judge Sabo,
   looking at his watch, said, "It's ten-twenty-eight-and-a-
   half. You have until 10:30."
   On Wednesday, the first day of the hearing, Judge Sabo
   turned his back and walked out of the courtroom as another
   defense lawyer, Rachel H. Wolkenstein, was addressing him
   about a legal issue. He came back a few minutes later,
   saying that he could not hear because of the noise coming
   from the street, where a large group of Mr. Abu-Jamal's
   supporters were chanting, "Free Mumia now."
   Richard B. Costello, the president of the Philadelphia
   Fraternal Order of Police, said he did not understand why
   Mr. Abu-Jamal's plight had drawn so much attention and big-
   league legal help.
   "He has more lawyers than Snow White had dwarfs," Mr.
   Costello said. "There's nothing special about this guy.
   He's a cop killer. We've had cop killers before, and,
   unfortunately, we'll have them again."
   Although Judge Sabo has frequently urged the defense to
   hurry, he interrupted the proceedings for several minutes
   to argue and reminisce with a baffled witness about the
   location of a swimming pool in his old neighborhood
   sometime around "1926 or '28."
   As he talked about the pool, a woman in the audience jumped
   to her feet and shouted, "Aren't we here to talk about a
   man's life?" She was escorted from the courtroom. Minutes
   later, the judge asked another question about the pool.
   Several of Mr. Abu-Jamal's supporters were removed for
   refusing to stand when Judge Sabo entered and another was
   taken outside for giving the judge a Nazi-style salute.

   "Electronic money in a race with Emu."
      Economic and monetary union or electronic money? Recent
      suggestions that the start of Emu might be delayed
      beyond 1999 raise the intriguing possibility that a
      viable international electronic money will be available
      before the European single currency. Depending on your
      perspective, this would be either disaster or nirvana.
      Disaster, because governments and central banks in
      countries with weak currencies would lose the seignorage
      that currency issue brings, and the sovereignty it is
      supposed to provide (but may not). Disaster, because it
      would destroy two central aims of Emu: the sharing of
      power between monetary authorities, and the attempted
      imposition of currency soundness by institutional fiat.
      Nirvana, because it would provide people with a powerful
      protection against the random and hidden taxation
      imposed on them when governments inflate, and because it
      would create monetary soundness via market forces.

   "Privacy Groups Assail FBI's Wiretapping Plan" [Excerpt]
   James Kallstrom, assistant FBI director in charge of the
   New York field division, argues that the proposal would in
   fact reduce the FBI's surveillance authority. "Today ... we
   could tap all the phones in the United States," he said,
   referring to older, pre-digital technology. Under the plan,
   the FBI's surveillance ability would shrink to a maximum of
   1 percent of simultaneous telephone calls from any one
   telephone switch, he said.
   Kallstrom said a typical central switching office in New
   York that serves 50,000 telephone lines has a capacity to
   carry only 5,000 calls simultaneously. It is the latter
   number, not the former, he said, on which the FBI bases its
   calculations. So the highest level of simultaneous
   surveillance in that area, he said, would be 50 lines.
   "We've never done that many" taps at one time, he said. But
   in a "worst-case scenario," such as a major act of
   terrorism, the agency might need such ability, he said. "I
   think it's a reasonable, minimal, conservative number."

The Washington Post, November 8, 1995.
   Return of the Cyber-Censors [Editorial]
   When the Senate passed its ill-advised "Exon amendment" to
   the telecommunications bill last spring, which would
   criminalize the transmission of obscene, pornographic or
   "indecent" material on the Internet, the measure got an
   overwhelming 84 votes, many of them from senators who
   didn't understand the implications of the move. Only a few
   weeks later, the House went even more overwhelmingly the
   other way, voting 420 to 4 for an amendment (co-sponsored
   by Reps. Ron Wyden and Christopher Cox) that would bar the
   Federal Communications Commission from regulating
   cyberspace and would instead make it legally easier for
   commercial Internet providers to use their own technical
   tools to regulate questionable material.
   The contrast was the result of a burst of public discussion
   in which more technologically astute members, including
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, caught on to the disturbing
   fact that the kinds of far-reaching liability imposed by
   Sen. James Exon's formulation -- hastily adapted from an
   existing measure on telephone transmission -- would cripple
   practically any commercial Internet provider and
   effectively lame the new medium as a venue for moneymaking
   activity.
   Now these vastly different measures are in conference
   committee along with the rest of the telecommunications
   bill (in other areas of which, we remind readers once
   again, The Washington Post Co. has some interests). But the
   seeming clarity afforded by the House response to the Exon
   amendment and by Mr. Gingrich's appreciation of the need
   for untrammeled development of the new medium is nowhere to
   be seen. A letter from Christian Coalition head Ralph Reed,
   Phyllis Schlafly and other prominent spokesmen for the
   religious right is urging the conferees toward an
   Exon-style approach that's as destructive now as it ever
   was. The House bill also could end up including an
   amendment sponsored by Rep. Henry Hyde that adds some
   criminal liability to the transmission of obscene (but not
   "indecent") images via the new technologies.
   The argument against "criminalizing" the transmission of
   "indecent" images via the Internet remains stark and
   simple, and it goes not to the awfulness of child
   pornography or even to the ability of parents to control
   what their children do on the computer (a wide variety of
   off-the-shelf technological filters now exist that let
   parents do this themselves) but to the impossibility of
   regulation by the electronic middleman industries that are
   developing.
   Commercial providers such as America Online continue to
   pass along millions of messages a day, the interactive
   "newsgroups" unfold quickly and internationally, and the
   kind of central filtering envisioned by would-be regulators
   erases the very quality that makes the Internet a live and
   promising medium -- its inexpensive accessibility. If the
   Internet were like a telephone system, there would at least
   be the possibility of identifying a specific "sender" and
   "recipient." On the Internet it's "receivers" who do the
   selecting of what to look at and where. Giving those
   recipients the tools they need remains the way to go. The
   conferees should resist the urge to censor cyberspace.

The New York Times, November 8, 1995.    Industry Group Rebuffs U.S. On Encryption
   By John Markoff
   The campaign by the Clinton Administration to create a
   standard for data encryption acceptable to industry, civil
   liberties and law enforcement groups broke down yesterday
   when a group including some of the nation's most powerful
   technology companies rejected a compromise proposal.
   The aim is to set a policy that meets the needs of
   electronic commerce as well as the concerns of the National
   Security Agency and other Federal offices that are opposed
   to the proliferation of data-coding software, feeling it
   will make it impossible for them to gather intelligence
   overseas.
   The Administration offered a compromise plan and had been
   seeking comment from the public. But the industry coalition
   said yesterday that it found the Government unwilling to
   compromise. Thus, the group of 37 companies said, it would
   formulate its own policy proposal to present to the White
   House and to Congress in the next six months.
   High-technology industries want a data-coding standard
   secure enough that both businesses and overseas customers
   could use it for sensitive financial and business
   correspondence. They seek a longer and more powerful
   encryption key than the Government is willing to grant, and
   object to Government demands that law enforcement agencies
   have "back-door" access to such transmissions that would
   allow them to intercept coded messages.
   The letter is signed by several of the country's leading
   computer, software and on-line companies, among them
   America Online, Apple Computer, AT&T, Eastman Kodak
   I.B.M.'s Lotus Development division, MCI Communications,
   Microsoft, Novell, Oracle Sybase and Tandem Computers.
   On Aug. 17, the Administration proposed a liberalization of
   export-control procedures for "key escrow" software
   products, or those providing law-enforcement access.
   "The current policy directive also does not address the
   need for immediate liberalization of current export
   restrictions," the letter said "Such liberalization is
   vital to enable U.S. companies to export state-of-the-art
   software products during the potentially lengthy process of
   developing and adopting a comprehensive national
   cryptography policy."

   Encryption Control Plan Sparks Industry Protest
      High-Tech Groups Say Proposals Unworkable
   By Elizabeth Corcoran
   High-technology companies and advocacy groups are writing
   to Vice President Gore and House Speaker Newt Gingrich to
   protest what they contend are unworkable federal proposals
   for controllng the export of data scrambling technology.
   The letters deepen an industry-government rift that began
   only days after federal officials unveiled an outline of
   what they hoped would be a palatable plan at an industry
   meeting in August.
   Two separate coalitions are criticizing the
   administration's draft proposal, which the government
   circulated on the Internet on Monday.
   Current export regulations prohibit companies froan sending
   overseas any encryption, or data-scrambling technology,
   that exceeds a certain degree of sophistication. The
   government argues that it needs to be able to peek at
   messages and files with proper court authorization -- to do
   its job of protecting U.S. citizens from terrorist groups
   and other malevolent organizations.
   In July, some French students demonstrated they could
   readily break the type of encryption technology that the
   U.S. government lets companies export. In August, the
   administration said it would let companies include more
   complex types of encryption, provided they pledged to
   entrust to an authorized agent a "spare key," or the means
   for unscrambling the information.
   Unlike early proposals in which the government said it
   would hold such keys, the administration is suggesting that
   companies and individuals would be able to select private
   keyholders, much the way people pick their banks.
   But after a brief honeymoon, industry and civil liberties
   groups began to find flaws with the details in the new
   proposals. This week's letters indicate that whatever
   fragile compromise the government had hoped it had found
   has grown even weaker.
   One coalition, pulled together by the Washington advocacy
   group Center for Democracy and Technology, includes about
   three dozen high-tech companies and associations. The group
   has promised to draft an alternative plan within six
   months.
   "There is a very serious message here: that national
   security can't be controlling the Internet," said Jerry
   Berman, executive director of the center. "There are other
   issues, global competitiveness and privacy, that need to be
   placed in the balance -- and the administration's policy
   doesn't do that."
   A second coalition of about 10 free-market and libertarian
   groups, led by another policy group, Americans for Tax
   Reform, plans to send their letter to Gingrich in the next
   day or two. The group contends the administration's
   encryption proposals are an encroachment on citizens' civil
   rights.
   The administration's proposals would not restrict tbe
   encryption technologies that people use within U.S.
   boundaries. But it would require that if they
   electronically send an encrypted message to parties outside
   the United States, a spare key must be stored with an
   authorized agency.
   "Even though we recognize [the administration] has worked
   hard on its proposals, it's not the right direction," said
   Rebecca Gould, director of policy at the Business Software
   Alliance, a trade association of software firms.
   "We've been in this [debate] since July 1994," she added,
   a long time for companies that churn out a new version of
   most products every 18 months. "That means lost sales for
   us and a loss of U.S. industry sales abroad."

   The political right has joined the opposition to the
   Clinton Administration's proposed restriction on the export
   of data-coding systems.
   A group of 12 conservative organizations -- including the
   National Rifle Association, Americans for Tax Reform and
   the Competitive Enterprise Institute -- sent a letter
   yesterday to House Speaker Newt Gingrich protesting
   Administration efforts to limit the export of cryptographic
   software and hardware.
   Calling the proposal anti-consumer, anti-business and
   anti-progress, the groups urged Mr. Gingrich to support the
   relaxation of export controls. "The Administration's
   approach is the wrong policy for today's marketplace," the
   letter stated.
   The letter to Mr. Gingrich followed one sent on Tuesday to
   Vice President Al Gore from 37 corporate and publicpolicy
   groups, including the Microsoft Corporation and America
   Online Inc. The letter to Mr. Gore opposed Administration
   efforts to strike a compromise that would limit the
   strength of encryption software exports and require an
   escrowed code-key system, which would contain trapdoor
   access for American law enforcement agencies.

   Neural nets aren't terribly useful for cryptanalysis,
   primarily because of the shape of the solution space.
   Neural nets work best with problems that have a continuity
   of solutions, some better than others. This allows a neural
   net to learn, proposing better and better solutions as it
   does. Breaking an algorithm provides for very little in the
   way of learning opportunities: You either recover the key
   or you don't. (At least this is true if the algorithm is
   any good.) Neural nets work well in structured environments
   where there is something to learn, but not in the
   high-entropy, seemingly random world of cryptography.

   This Is the CEO -- Get Me the CIA [Op-Ed, excerpts]
   By Ernest Brod. (Mr. Brod is executive managing director of
   Kroll Associates, an international investigation, business
   intelligence and security frim based in New York.)
   While government policy makers ponder and debate [economic
   espionage] issues, U.S. companies are fighting the global
   competitiveness battle. In the past year U.S. companies
   have rushed to level the playing field with foreign
   competitors who have long exploited the advantage of
   competitor intelligence. For years, foreign-based
   multinationals have had teams of people devoted to learning
   as much as they could about their U.S. competitors. The
   methods ranged from in-depth research and analysis of
   publicly available information to covert and sometimes
   clumsy attempts at industrial espionage, in some cases with
   the active support of their government's intelligence
   agencies.
   Today, having had their consciousness raised by the global
   business realities of the '90s, U.S. companies in all
   industries are scrambling to set up units devoted to
   gathering strategic information about the competition.
   Teams can be found at both corporate and division levels;
   they may be multi-department or reside within planning,
   development, marketing, finance or international units.
   They may have euphemistic labels and they increasingly draw
   upon burgeoning numbers of outside private resources.
   In recent months, for example, my firm was asked to help
   determine:
   + Whether an Asian competitor will take advantage of the
   North American Free Trade Agreement to establish facilities
   in Mexico in order to supply the U.S. market.
   + How an overseas competitor with an apparently comparable
   cost base can consistently produce lower bids.
   + Who controls an overseas private company and how deep are
   their pockets.
   While the controversy continues over whether U.S. companies
   should be favored with government-sponsored industrial
   intelligence, managers are already employing legal and
   ethical research and investigative techniques to learn more
   about the methods, resources and plans of their marketplace
   adversaries.
   These forays may not be exciting, risky or glamorous enough
   for our battle-hardened spy masters, but they help American
   strategists win hard-fought ground from their adversaries.

   "When Patients' Records Are Commodities for Sale."
      Individual medical records, carrying more sensitive
      personal information than ever before, are increasingly
      being gathered and stored by the tens of thousands in
      commercial databanks maintained by institutions like
      hospital networks, health maintenance organizations and
      drug companies. And although there is a Federal law that
      protects the privacy of video rental lists, private
      medical information is being bought and sold freely.
      The issue of medical privacy touches virtually everyone.
      "It is true to say that if you know a person's history
      of health problems, then you know more about that person
      than you would with any other data," said Lawrence O.
      Gostin, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
      And as medical records start including new genetic
      information that can predict diseases likely to show up
      in years to come, they will be able to reveal "not just
      health histories, but health futures," Mr. Gostin said.
      Yesterday hearings were held on a bill called the
      Medical Records Confidentiality Act, intended to

   Another realm of explosive population increase is in
   cyberspace, a phenomenon taken up in this issue with Sherry
   Turkle's "Ghosts in the Machine." Here the growth comes
   about not only in the traditional way but also in wildly
   non-traditional ways. People multiply themselves on the
   Internet, grafting various aspects of their personalities
   onto distinct characters. Even more unsettling, as Turkle
   wittily documents the matter, is that the Net is populated
   with "bots": robot sentence-parsing engines that can do
   fair impersonations of real people, often well enough to
   (provisionally) pass Alan M. Turing's test for machine
   consciousness. Do you really know who -- or what -- you're
   talking to?
   The future of all this is murky and mind-boggling:
   Information-seeking bots even now can tie up sites on the
   World-Wide Web. Bots impersonating people share chat groups
   with other bots, much the way telephone answering machines
   now "talk" to each other. Internet chatter gets so dense
   that bandwidth and other Net resources become strained: the
   site at the Los Alamos National Laboratory now
   (automatically) warns robots away with a chilling threat to
   "initiate automated 'seek and destroy' " action against the
   machine from which the robot seems to be launched. A
   conservative reaction may already be setting in, determined
   to have users identify, encrypt and authenticate every
   packet of information they send across the Net.
   Net fatigue becomes a recognized medical syndrome; Net
   detox centers spring up; Net warfare breaks out; Net
   starvation becomes a recognized social problem; Net
   demagogues undermine local democracies....

   Cornell University has reached agreement with four students
   on punishment for a widely distributed E-mail message they
   wrote listing "75 reasons why women should not have freedom
   of speech." The university rejected harsh penalties like
   suspension because the students did not engage in sexual

   The university had investigated complaints of sexual
   harassment and misuse of computer resources after the
   message made its way on the Internet last month, angering
   thousands of computer users who sent angry responses to the
   four students. The message included the lines, "If she
   can't speak, she can't cry rape" and, "Of course, if she
   can't speak, she can't say no."
   The university said the students had agreed to attend a

      Debate on high-tech fighting culminates in the question
      of whether information technologies -- a computer virus,
      for one -- could make conventional military hardware
      obsolete and whether they would make possible a virtual

      What Comes Next:
      The End of Big Government And the New Paradigm Ahead
      By James P. Pinkerton
      Hyperion. 404 pp. $24.95
      In Pinkerton's account, bureaucracy survives today only
      because no one has yet developed a coherent replacement
      model." Instead we have deluded ourselves into thinking
      that periodic upgrading of what Pinkerton calls the
      "Bureaucratic Operating System" (BOS) -- in the same way
      that computer software is upgraded -- will enable us to
      avoid the gloomy prospect of life in the "Cyber Future,"
      his term for the horrific predicament of extreme
      inequality and hypercrime to which we are headed.
      At one point Pinkerton suggests that a parallel for Bill
      Clinton may be found in Mikhail Gorbachev. Both leaders
      "shrank from genuine perestroika" after their peoples
      had come to the realization that the system itself was
      the problem.
      Displaying a sure grasp of popular culture, technology
      and political history, Pinkerton writes engagingly and
      insightfully about the defects and malfunctionings of
      the American bureaucratic state. His refreshing analyses
      of the flaws in bureaucratic thinking are among the best
      that we have on the subject and, surely, the wittiest.

Picking up on Tim's and Atilla's comments on Netscape, GAK,
   a WTO czar and government regulation of security on the
   Net:
   Jim Clark's speech was probably a trial balloon, to see
   what the reaction would be. Remember that the NIST
   conference on KE is December 5.
   It would make sense for the corporations to welcome
   application of police power to handle threats to public
   order, in cyberworld like the other. That way they reduce
   culpability for failures of their private security systems,
   as they do on private real estate property.
   Key escrow requires someplace for the buck to stop beyond
   several private pitstops, and that is usually Uncle Sugar
   when no other party has the resources to withstand
   sustained, substantial, culture-wide risk -- as, say, in
   the financial realm. Internationally, the same need exists.
   Probably the corporations  would like to work in concert
   with governments on this, so no single firm, or nation,
   gets stigmatized, or wounded and prey to vultures -- as
   Netscape was with the brute hack, and as Microsoft and
   others have been with other attacks on their lightly
   guarded property, or as the US might be if it does not work
   out international agreements.
   Moreover, it has been noted here that government contracts
   are crucial for a new company -- for testing, for
   credibility, for prestige. All the major players already
   have such vital contracts -- indeed most would not have
   thrived without them -- so why would Netscape, and its    investors, not want them too?
   It's possible that Netscape was selected to sound off on KE
   to see if it could play with the Big Boys -- take the heat,
   pass initiation, qualify for the Bohemian Grove bear hugs
   of assured stability, growth and profits.
   Could be, though, that after getting stable R/E for his    backers, Jim will be confident enough to join Pixar in that    rhumba risk of mercurial, evanescent mass-marketers.
   That's not to be believed now at 7,000 times earnings.

   U.S. Export Rules to Ease On Some Supercomputers
   Washington -- President Clinton is expected to announce
   today that he is easing export restrictions on certain U.S.
   supercomputers, a move sought by the computer industry.
   Administration officials say that given continuing
   technological advances and world-wide availability of many
   high-speed computers, the current restrictions are
   unrealistic and damaging to American companies. Critics
   contend, however, that easing the restrictions will
   exacerbate weapons proliferation.
   Mr. Clinton approved raising the speed of computers that
   may be exported to most countries to 2,000 million
   theoretical operations a second, or MTOPS, from 1,500
   MTOPS, according to officials. For certain nations,
   including China, Egypt, Israel, India, Pakistan, Syria and
   Russia, civilian customers would be able to buy computers
   with speeds up to 7,000 MTOPS without prior government
   approval. Military customers in those countries could
   purchase computers with speeds of 2,000 to 7,000 MTOPS but
   only with an individual export license.
   Certain nations, such as Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Libya,
   would still be banned from buying high-speed computers.

   Financial Times, September 27, 1995
   When it's all in the mind
   At the department of medical informatics at Graz
   University of Technology in Austria, Gert Pfurtscheller is
   working on a project that could result in
   thought-controlled devices.
   Stephen Roberts, a researcher at the electrical and
   electronics engineering department at Imperial College
   London, has worked with Pfurtscheller's team. He hopes to
   improve the signal classification accuracy by using
   artificial neural networks, computer-based systems designed
   to mimic the way the human brain works.
   Roberts's work is part of an EU research programme called
   Anndee (Artificial Neural Networks for Diagnosis and
   Enhancement of EEG) which involves around 30 researchers in
   a dozen European universities.
   The Consciousness Research laboratory at the University of
   Nevada is pursing a more controversial line of research
   into psychic phenomena or, as its director, Dean Radin,
   prefers to call it, Direct Man/Machine Interaction (DMMI).
   A number of Japanese companies including NEC and
   Matsushita, have also conducted research into DMMI. Radin
   believes that in 20 to 50 years' time, it will be possible
   to use DMMI to operate devices.
   The technology company The Other 90 Per Cent, based in
   Sausalito, California, has developed MindDrive, a computer
   games system whose programs are controlled by thought.
   MindDrive is designed to work with most IBM-compatible
   personal computers. A console, which analyses the user's
   brain waves, plugs into the back of the computer. Users
   wear a sensor sleeve over their index finger. At present,
   the system can only be used to move a cursor up and down.
   MindDrive will be on sale in the US early next year. The
   console will cost between $100 (65 pounds) to $200, and
   MindDrive games some of which will enable users to create
   music or draw on a computer screen by thought, will cost
   around $30 to $40 each.

      Does Microsoft have a foreign policy? Mr. Ballmer says
      Microsoft doesn't have a foreign policy per se. But it
      does have a global business agenda. Since Microsoft
      today has twice the market value of General Motors, it's
      worth looking at that agenda because it is bound to
      influence U.S. foreign policy. Microsoft doesn't need
      Washington to open doors for it because foreign
      governments are begging Microsoft to come in and
      translate Windows 95 into their languages, so they can
      get on the information highway. Describing his contacts
      with foreign leaders, Mr. Ballmer put it this way:
      "People say, 'You have this technology. We hear it's
      changing the world. Tell us how it can help us.' "

      however, one aspect of this change is especially
      important: its effect on "economic sovereignty". They
      claim that global integration is emasculating the modern
      state. If the number of believers is any guide, these
      views are appealing. Yet the new orthodoxy is wrong. The
      world has changed, the global economy has indeed
      arrived: nonetheless, the emasculated state is a myth.

      A new concern over the long-term causes of wars and

      urgent today by American foreign policy makers in much
      the same manner as military threats like new
      surface-to-air missile sites alarmed policy makers
      several decades ago. So in addition to their traditional
      intelligence gathering -- arms, nuclear weapons
      programs, expansion of foreign armies -- American policy
      makers are looking more than ever before at natural
      phenomena in their search for the deeper roots of war
      and threats to global security.
      "During the cold war, most security threats stemmed from
      state-to-state aggression, so most of the analysis was
      of factors that could produce state-to-state
      aggression," said James Steinberg, the State
      Department's director of policy planning. "Now we're
      focusing more on internal factors that can destabilize
      governments and lead to civil wars and ethnic strife.
      Now we're paying much more attention to early warning
      factors, like famine and the environment."
      Angelo Codevilla, an intelligence expert who teaches at

   Discovery of lnternet Flaws Is Setback for On-Line Trade
   By John Markoff
   San Francisco, Oct. 10 -- Newly publicized weaknesses in
   the basic structure of the Internet indicate that the
   worldwide computer network may need a time-consuming
   redesign before it can be safely used as a commercial
   medium.
   The flaws could allow an eavesdropper or criminal to divert
   many types of documents or software programs traveling over
   the Internet, examine or copy or alter them, and then pass
   them on to the intended recipient -- who would have no easy
   way of knowing that the files had been waylaid. Not only
   could electronic mail be read in transit or credit card
   numbers be copied en route, but special security techniques
   meant to protect such transactions could be dismantled
   without the user's knowledge.
   That such security flaws exist is not surprising in a
   system designed originally as a scientific experiment. But
   the recent rush to the Internet by companies seeking to
   exploit its commercial possibilities has obscured the fact
   that giving the system a new purpose has unearthed
   fundamental problems that could well put off true
   commercial viability for years.
   "Companies would have you believe this is a trivial
   problem," said Eric Brewer, a professor of computer science
   at the University of California at Berkeley. "But now there
   is a financiat incentive to exploit these flaws and to do
   it secretly."
   The problems were described in a posting that researchers
   at the university made on Monday to several on-line
   discussion groups. While the discussion groups are intended
   for computer security experts, they are potentially
   accessible to millions of Internet users -- including
   break-in artists, who are known to monitor such discussion
   groups for tips on new ways to crack computer systems.
   The researchers who described the Internet weaknesses
   include two Berkeley computer science graduate students who
   noted a security weakness in a popular Netscape
   Communications Corporation software program last month.
   Then as now, the students' stated motivation in publicizing
   the problems was to underscore vulnerabilities facing all
   companies and customers wishing to use the Internet for
   commerce.
   When the Netscape problems were disclosed last month, the
   company said the security flaws would be corrected in the
   next version of its software, which users would be able to
   download at no charge from Netscape's Internet site. But
   the newly publicized flaws in the Internet itself indicate
   that even if a user downloaded a copy of the new, improved
   Netscape program, a criminal could tamper with the copy
   along the way and make it unsafe for use in credit card
   transactions.
   The problem is not Netscape's alone; it potentially affects
   any organization that operates a computer from which files
   or software could be downloaded over the Internet. The
   weakness can be traced to the technical underpinnings of
   the network, which was set up more than a quarter-century
   ago not as a medium for conducting business but as a way
   for academic and scientific researchers to exchange
   information.
   The disclosure of the flaws casts doubt on the aspirations
   of companies like Netscape, which last summer had one of
   the most successful stock offerings in Wall Street history
   based on the promise of the impending arrival of a
   full-fledged on-line marketplace.
   "Companies should take a step back and think about this a
   little more," said Ian Goldberg, one of the Berkeley
   students. "If it takes a bit longer but comes out more
   secure, we will all be better off in the long run."
   The way many Internet systems are set up -- especially the
   Internet's increasingly popular World Wide Web service in
   which software images and even video and audio clips can be
   easily downloaded -- information is stored on a computer
   called a file server and then transferred to a user's
   computer when it is needed.
   The newly publicized weakness occurs in a widely used
   Internet protocol -- or technical standard -- known as the
   Network File System, or NFS. Because NFS does not have any
   means for allowing the recipient of a program or document
   to verify that it has not been altered during transmission
   from the file server to the user, any interception or
   tampering would go undetected.
   "The Internet protocols have been insecure since day one,"
   said Jeffrey I. Schiller, the manager of computer networks
   at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director
   of an industry task force that is trying to design a new
   secure version of the Internet.
   But the group's timetable is uncertain, and even when it
   does have recommendations ready, Mr. Schiller is not
   optimistic that the industry will be willing to devote the
   time and money to put them into effect.
   He said that many technologies already exist for improving
   commercial security on the Internet, but many of them
   require too much technical sophistication on the part of
   computer users. He criticized makers of hardware and
   software for not moving more quickly to make easy-to-use
   security features a built-in part of the technology used on
   the Internet.
   "The people who should be the leaders in offering security
   have been too busy counting their money to build these
   features in to their products," Mr. Schiller said.
   Some commercial Internet merchants have tended to play down
   the potential for harm from an illegal interception of
   credit card information over the Internet. They point out
   that consumers routinely make their credit card numbers
   available in transactions done by mail or telephone and
   that the law puts limits on a consumer's liability in cases
   of credit card fraud.
   But Mr. Brewer, the Berkeley professor, said that the
   crucial difference in the proposed Internet commerce
   systems was that for the first time it would be relatively
   simple for a criminal to collect hundreds or thousands of
   credit card numbers. Then a thief could use each credit
   card only one time, making detection much more difficult.
   Sensitive to heightened concerns about security, Wells
   Fargo, the large California bank, which earlier this year
   began permitting customers with personal computers to view
   their account information with the Netscape software,
   suspended the service in September after the Berkeley
   students reported the flaw in Netscape.
   After Netscape followed with an improved version of its
   software, Wells Fargo officials found it secure enough that
   they planned to resume the service later this week. The
   bank will, however, require customers to use the corrected
   version of the Netscape program.
   Even then. Wells Fargo customers will be able only to view
   account balances and other information, but not transfer
   money or conduct other transactions of the type that might
   leave them vulnerable to the Internet NFS weakness.
   "We still hope to be able to offer transactional
   capabilities next year, but this has slowed us down a
   little bit," said Lorna Doubet, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman.
   "Many of our customers feel that security is absolutely
   essential and we have to be cautious in this regard."
   Executives at Netscape said yesterday that they were aware
   of the security issues surrounding NFS and would make
   changes in the next release of their software expected
   before the end of the year to permit a recipient of a
   downloaded program to check it for signs of tampering.
   And hoping to take advantage of the fault-finding talents
   of the Berkeley researchers and other like-minded software
   experts, the company announced a contest today called
   Netscape Bugs Bounty, in which Netscape will award prizes
   to users who find bugs or security loopholes in its
   software.
   Some Internet experts said they expected that many security
   weaknesses like the one the Berkeley group had demonstrated
   would be found, because the Internet was simply not
   designed to insure secure commerce.
   "Imagine a walled town or a house," said Noel Chiappa, a
   member of the Internet Engineering Task Force, a
   standards-setting group. "It doesn't matter if 99 windows
   are tight as can be -- if the 100th is wide open, the bad
   guys will bypass your security. "

@_subject: Enigma 
The NYT reports today on a British best-selling novel about
   breaking the Enigma codes, published this month in the US:
      Enigma, by Robert Harris, Random House.
      Harris interviewed many of the people who worked at
      Bletchley Park, and, most challenging, had to wrestle
      with complex mathematics to explain how the codes were
      broken ... by an elite comprised of an eccentric band of
      British and refugee intellectuals, aided by young women
      carefully picked from upper-class British families.
      So, Mr. Harris was asked, is the book a celebration of
      British amateurism? "There's a bit of that," he
      conceded. "Just as the British benefited from that
      tradition, the Germans were undone by the ruthless
      military efficiency, which made it easier to read their
      messages. The idea of brains taking on brute strength
      does have a certain romantic appeal."
      More than one reviewer said Harris was a thriller writer
      in the British tradition of Eric Ambler, Len Deighton,
      John Le Carre and John Buchan. "Harris has fashioned a
      story that is as humane, intelligent and gripping as
      documentary fiction can get, the critic Anthony Quinn
      wrote in The Financial Times. This is a story of
      intelligence, romance, twisted logic and necessary
      compromise," Peter Millar wrote in The Times of London,
      adding that it was "altogether top-class stuff."

@_subject: FT on IT Standards 
The Financial times today has four-page insert on the
   complexity and difficulty of developing international
   standards for all types of products. There is a passing
   mention of the Internet security issue. An article on
   standards for IT confirms Perry's oft-made points about the
   slow pace, protracted angling for market share, and the by-
   pass of standards by market go-getters who foster messes.
   Here are quotes on the last point:
      Paul Callahan of Forrester Research: "When a company
      owns a market they can determine the pace -- a company
      in its early stages of domination can move the ball
      forward swiftly -- such as the Internet Web software
      provider Netscape. Netscape didn't spend a lot of time
      with standards bodies -- it simply joined forces with
      MasterCard to co-develop Secure Courier, much as
      Microsoft enrolled Visa to develop its STT, Secure
      Transaction Technology. Only afterwards are the
      overtures made to standards bodies. That's commerce, and
      it's the way things are in the real world."
      Henry Ryan, convenor of the Iso-IEC JTC1 ad hoc working
      group on GII: "People ask, 'Can you afford to wait for
      standards?' I'd turn it round. If you don't, you suffer
      in the long term and end up with an unholy mess. If
      people do their own thing then the benefits -- and the
      problems -- may not be concentrated in one sector of the
      industry. We're finding that with the convergence of
      technologies, such as the superhighway, it isn't enough
      to develop standards for the IT sector,       or consumer electronics individually."

The Econom of Oct 14 ogles the catfight between Wintel
   and JavaNet to outclaw whineflesh.
   "Will your next computer be a tin can and a wire?"
      This week's fall in technology stocks was bad enough.
      But what if the Internet destroyed the personal-computer
      industry ...?
      Sun, Oracle and Netscape are spending tens of millions
      of dollars on a bet that the Internet can do a lot more
      than pass around e-mail and transmit data. They think it
      can also do much of the work of today's computers,
      holding not just information but software, from word
      processors and spreadsheets to games and entertainment
      programs. Most radically, they go on to argue that this
      could end the reign of the personal computer. Forget
      Windows 95; some people are starting to wonder if they
      need Microsoft at all.
      But those who predict that such machines will kill the
      PC are ignoring computing history, and glitch-prone real
      life. The PC beat the mainframe because users wanted the
      whole computer on their desktop, not in the basement.
      That makes Java terminals look like a step backwards: by
      putting program storage far away down a shared network,
      it makes it vulnerable to delays, congestion, and all
      the unpredictability of anything out of a user's
      control.

   "Emerging Role For the C.I.A.: Economic Spy."
      During the Clinton Administration's tense negotiations
      with Japan last spring Mickey Kantor received inside
      information gathered by the C.I.A.'s Tokyo station and
      the electronic eavesdropping equipment of the N.S.A.
      "But in the end, did it help much? Beyond some valuable
      detail we could not have gotten elsewhere, did it tell
      us much about which way Hashimoto would go? It would be
      hard to make that case."
      Many Administration officials suggest that the agency
      simply does not have the talent for such analysis. "The
      best graduate students don't go there and who can blame
      them?" said one of the Administration's top economic
      officials. "And yet, when you sit in a meeting, the
      views of the C.I.A. are often given more weight than the
      Council of Economic Advisors. Go figure."
      Allan E. Goodman, a former C.I.A. official and academic
      dean of Georgetown University's School of Foreign
      Service, said "We don't have the sources, we don't have
      the expertise. To develop an understanding of the people
      who trade currencies, their motivations, their
      lifestyles, you'd have to send your people to Harvard,
      Stanford and Wharton for years. Currency traders keep
      secrets very, very well, and to penetrate that would be
      the equivalent of cracking all the Japanese codes in
      World War II."

   at all to Netscape's front office guys bullshitting the
   stock holders and speculators. Check the press releases and
   the speeches to customers and investors.
   Scott McNealy shocked an audience into silence at a recent
   plush meeting of high-tech reps with investors by asking,
   "Anybody telling the truth here?" Then applause broke out    his shrewd beat-em-to-the-punch candor to offset the
   pervasive cynicism of oft-burned high-tech investors.
   Big bucks are not made by hard-working programmers but by
   the marketeers of NASDAQ and NYSE smoke and mirrors used to
   lure multitudes of unsavvy investors and Internet
   merchandisers.
   Netscape's leaders are protecting its major stockholding
   coldhearts, just like Microsoft, Intel, Motorola, AT&T,
   and the rest do, or they die in the financial fuck-the-
   public sharkpool. They couldn't care less about the bottom-
   of-the-ladder techies who do the grunge work, take the
   blame for programming mistakes produced under
   horrendous marketing deadlines, and then are left to

      Think of them as a truth squad of cyberspace, these

      have a more humanized system of commerce."

      Some investors believe Netscape could become "the next

      All these new features of Navigator 2.0 send a clear
      notice to the industry that Netscape has no interest in
      bowing to the traditional Internet procedures for
      setting software standards by academic and scientific
      committee. The Internet has become primarily a
      commercial medium, where standards are set by whoever
      has the highest market share. It is a concept Microsoft
      knows well, and one that Netscape has grasped.

The New Yorker of October 23 reports on the "Supernote,"
   a perfect counterfeit $100-bill allegedly being used for
   economic terrorism.
      The Supernote had surfaced around 1990 and originated in
      the Middle East. It was no ordinary counterfeit. The
      workmanship was extraordinary. When a sample first
      arrived at the Secret Service's laboratory, a top
      technical analyst "examined it the way he has every
      other counterfeit note in the world, and called it
      genuine." Most alarming of all, the Supernote was so
      well engineered that it could fool currency scanners at
      the nation's twelve Federal Reserve banks.
      Today, the Supernote remains one of the longest unsolved
      counterfeiting cases in the modern history of the Secret
      Service, and it has begun to undermine international
      confidence in United States currency.
      The Treasury, taking its cue from the Federal Reserve,
      has a difficult time regarding counterfeiting, even on
      a very large scale, as a macroeconomic problem, because
      cash is a relatively small percentage of the total money
      supply. Wire transfers, checks, and credit-card
      transactions, after all, run into the trillions.
      Counterfeiting becomes significant to the Fed only if it
      undermines confidence in the dollar.
      Dozens of interviews with high-level insiders left the
      impression that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury
      don't fear the Supernote itself as much as they fear a
      confidence problem that might result if they publicly
      acknowledge it and countenance a large-scale
      investigation. (As one expert on international terrorism
      who has looked into the Supernote puts it, "If the note
      is that nearly perfect, it doesn't exist.")

   "Pentagon Plans More Espionage. Business Fronts Abroad
   Would Expand Efforts Of a Unified Service."
      The Defense Department has merged its separate covert
      intelligence operations and plans to expand its
      espionage abroad, starting with establishment of phony
      businesses overseas as cover, and has formed the Defense
      HUMINT (Human Intelligence) Service, or DHS. Under the
      fiscal 1996 intelligence authorization bill, the DHS has
      been given a trial period of three years to carry on
      commercial activities "to provide cover security to
      intelligence collection activities undertaken abroad."
      The authority "to provide bona fide commercial cover,"
      was so that DHS's covert operatives could "withstand
      detailed investigation by hostile foreign intelligence
      services as well as domestic scrutiny."
      ... scandal of the Army's Yellow Fruit op ...
      CIA case officers are working with DHS on the cover
      companies abroad; cooperation is needed because in
      recent years military spies overseas inadvertently had
      set up relations with foreigners known to be double
      agents.
      Sen. Bob Kerrey called on CIA Director John M. Deutch to
      "develop his human collectors, planning 10 or more years
      in advance for their peak usefulness," a reference to
      placing them abroad under deep cover for use in future
      crises.

      barrages against ammunition dumps, command posts and
      artillery. It could prove particularly valuable in the
      early stages of a crisis, before ground troops were in
      place. It would travel with other ships and submarines
      for protection, and target information would be provided
      by other vessels, reconnaissance aircraft, pilotless

   8. TECSEC's "The Merger of Technology and Cryptographic Key
      Management" (6 pp.).
   Note 1: It was Michael Nelson of the White House who said
   that the reason to maintain the 64-bit limit for export was
   because the key escrow methodology had not yet been proven
   reliable and that the security agencies insisted on the
   relatively weak system in case key escrow failed.
   Note 2: At the B-2 breakout session there was strong debate
   on a proposal for a "Criteria Zero":
      Before addressing any of the details of Criteria 3, 4
      and 9 as presented to us, Group B-2 registers its view
      that export under general license of strong encryption
      should not require key escrow.
   A vote on the proposal was 7 yes, 7 no and 13 absentions.
   It was not reported to the plenary session.

     URL: Here's a sample:
Intel Scalable Systems Division
   Fortunately, advances in computer hardware and software    are making computer-based virtual weapons testing and prototyping a
   viable and affordable alternative to the traditional nuclear    non-nuclear testing of stockpile stewardship. The Intel    computer announced today is a key milestone in the shift from nuclear
   testing to computer-simulated testing.
  The ASCI Program
   Located within the DOE's Defense Programs (DP) laboratories, the U.S.
   Department of Energy's Accelerated Strategic Computing    (ASCI) is a multi-year program to extend DOE's computational    to support virtual testing and prototyping capabilities for    weapons. ...
   ASCI has four objectives, each of which requires    capabilities that are beyond the capabilities of existing      * Performance -- Create credible virtual tests to analyze        performance and predict the behavior of nuclear weapons.
     * Safety -- Predict the behavior of full weapons systems in complex
       accident scenarios.
     * Reliability -- Develop the ability to make predictions that will
       extend the lifetime of current weapons, predict failure        and reduce routine maintenance requirements.
     * Renewal -- Use virtual prototyping to reduce production        testing facilities for stockpile requalification and        work. ...
   Beyond its weapons safety impact, the teraflop computer will have a
   wide range of other applications -- from developing safer,    efficient cars to simulating natural disasters in real-time to finding
   new drugs to fight disease. The machine will be one of the    foremost scientific research tools and will act as a magnet    advanced research projects.
   In 1963, John Kennedy referred to a test ban treaty as a shaft of
   light cut into the darkness of the Cold War -- a chance to step back
   from the shadows of war. Today, by making it possible to ensure the
   safety, reliability, and performance of the weapons stockpile while
   foregoing nuclear testing, the Intel/Sandia teraflop computer can help
   the world take a further step back from the shadows of war into the
   light of peace.

Responding to msg by anonymous-remailer at shell.portal.com () on Sun, 10 Sep  2:8  AM
   Picking up the possible mandated use of key escrow in the
   UK:
   There was chat at the NIST key escrow meeting that low-bit
   key escrow may be the global policy in the works among
   governments. With a blanket outlawing of all non-escrowed
   systems. And, that US key escrow and 64-bit export policy
   is a harbinger of domestic regulation.
   A fed at the B-2 breakout session imperiously barked the
   mantra chanted by several feds at the general meeting, "64-
   bit encryption is what industry asked for, why are you now
   complaining."
   To the counter-question, "what industry are you referring
   to?" the answer was always just "industry."
   The USG's latest key escrow policy, the NIST meetings and
   the Intellectual Cryptography Insitute's conference "Global
   Challenges" posted here may be the surfacing of a well-
   orchestrated government and "industry" collusion on this
   issue. Note the common ever-present attendees of both NIST
   and the ICI meetings.
   Certainly, some "industry" spokespersons like "Daughter of
   Clipper" Denning presume by their tone of writing that key
   escrow is on its way to supremacy, with only quibbling left
   on the criteria for acceptably "competitive" variations.
   The NIST handouts of industry players seem to bear this out
   as well, even as some join the public kibitzing. Perhaps
   their raz, and that of BSA, is just a diverting smokescreen
   to induce complacency -- or squeaking wheels to get USG
   attention for sweetheart contracts.
   Maybe they've already met privately with USG reps to get
   rewarded with a piece of the PGP/non-escrow clamp-down biz
   -- more venerable suckling of national security kabooty as
   advised by smart-varmints like ex-NSA Mr. Stewart
   Abercrombie Baker, Every-meet-attending-Esq.
   I wonder if Mrs. Denning and Mr. Baker are advising their
   sweating crypto clients, "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em,
   the international escrow train is leaving the station,
   better get on before it's too late."
   While fretting of derailment by hackers, or worse, by
   international security agencies paranoid of gov-biz
   complicity to take over the "if you knew what I knew"
   crypto-protected cornucopia.
   Wonder who's really engineering this GAK Limited runaway?
   Does anybody know David Kahn well enough to ask what he's
   finding as NSA Visiting Historian -- in the archives and in
   the job-insecure-spook resumes heat-seeking crypto fires?

The New York Times, September 11, 1995, p. D7.
   Technology / Peter H. Lewis
   On The Net. Privacy for computers? Clinton sets the stage
   for a debate on data encryption.
   In terms of its ability to raise the nation's blood
   pressure, the debate over data encryption has not yet
   reached the same levels as gun control.
   But last week the Clinton Administration appeared to set
   the stage for an equally divisive debate over the degree to
   which businesses and individuals have the right to keep
   secrets when using telephones, computers and other forms of
   electronic communications.
   In two days of public hearings last week in Gaithersburg,
   Md., home of the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology, the Administration introduced its long-awaited
   proposals to relax restrictions on the export of
   cryptographic software.
   The Administration drew a line in the virtual sands of
   cyberspace, signaling that it is willing to permit
   Americans to put stronger cryptographic locks on their
   electronic data only if a spare key to those locks is made
   available on demand to law-enforcement agencies.
   There looms the conflict. Although the debate is about
   export controls the "export" issue is irrelevant in today's
   era of global electronic networks. Placing a common privacy
   program on an Internet computer in Austin, Tex., is
   effectively no different from sending a shrink-wrapped copy
   of the program to Moscow.
   The real issue is how much privacy the Government is
   willing to allow its own citizens, and the latest word from
   the Clinton Administration is that the right to electronic
   privacy, like the right to bear arms, is not absolute.
   Cryptography is the science of secret writing. In this
   digital era, it applies not just to notes, but also to
   telephone calls, money transfers, bank and credit card
   records, electronic mail, faxes and other computer files.
   The Clinton Administration's goal is to allow Americans to
   use the strongest possible cryptographic technology, while
   at the same time preserving the ability of law-enforcement
   agencies to perform court-authorized wiretaps as part of
   the effort to catch drug dealers, terrorists, child
   pornographers and other miscreants.
   In other words, it favors strong cryptography, but not too
   strong.
   The strength of cryptographic software is measured by the
   length of the software key necessary to encode and decode
   a message. The longer the key, the harder it is for an
   unauthorized user to decipher the message.
   In recent years, the Government has generally permitted
   Americans to export cryptographic software with key lengths
   up to 40 bits. Experts say that 40-bit keys are secure from
   casual snooping, but will fall quickly to a determined
   codebreaker.
   Last week, after more than a year of intense analysis, the
   Government introduced what it said was the best possible
   compromise.
   Under the new policy, companies can export encryption
   algorithms using 64-bit keys, which are much more secure,
   but only if spare keys are given to "escrow agents" who
   would make them available to lawenforcement agents under
   standard legal procedures, similar to legal wiretaps
   authorized by a judge. Otherwise, the 40-bit limit
   continues to apply.
   Such a "key escrow" scheme is anathema to many privacy
   advocates who fear Government abuses. The Government first
   proposed a key escrow system with its so-called Clipper
   Chip, a technology that failed to win acceptance even as a
   voluntary standard.
   The new scheme is somewhat more palatable than Clipper. Key
   escrow is still unpopular with American computer and
   software companies, which say it prevents them from
   competing against foreign companies that have no similar
   constraints, and with many multinational corporations,
   which say it prevents them from working with foreign
   companies that do not especially care for the idea of Uncle
   Sam holding the keys to their data banks.
   "If this was intended to be any sort of compromise, I don't
   think it achieved its end," said Whitfield Diffie, a Sun
   Microsystems enginePs who attended the meetings. "I didn't
   see anybody who was enthusiastic."
   Raymond G. Kammer, deputy director of N.l.S.T., suggested
   that the hearings last week were intended to elicit public
   comment, and that the Administration's final position on
   cryptographic policy were still under analysis.
   But the emergence of key escrow issues at the N.l.S.T.
   proceedings suggests that key escrow is emerging as a
   nonnegotiable demand by some factions of the Clinton
   Administration, especially the Justice Department and the
   Federal Bureau of Investigation, led by Louis Freeh.
   "If this fails," said a figure familiar with the
   Administration's thinking on the proposed change in
   cryptographic policy, "it's going to lead to a very
   divisive debate. And the irony, for libertarians who oppose
   key escrow, is that if it fails, I am convinced that Louis
   Freeh cannot be true to his job without proposing domestic
   controls on data encryption."
   "He's not going to give up without a fight, and neither is
   the Justice Department," said the figure, who spoke on the
   condition he not be identified.
   Others say they do not think the Clinton Administration has
   yet arrived at a concrete position, even after more than a
   year of study and debate. "I don't think it's a final
   offer," said John Gilmore, an engineer at Cygnus Support,
   a computer company in Mountain View, Calif. "It looks to me
   like a weak strawman, a first offer, a proposal to dance."
   The question is whether American citizens and businesses
   have the patience to wait for the music to start. And the
   issue may be moot, anyway because the Internet is no more
   controlled by the United States than is the United Nations.
   "The Internet Architecture Board has specifically decided
   to ignore export controls in designing the security
   infrastructure for the next generation of Internet
   protocols," Mr. Gilmore said. "The Internet of 1998 will
   provide automatic, secure, and fully private communication,
   without key escrow, internationally."
   In other words, the Internet community is already planning
   to jump over the new line in the sand drawn last week by
   the Administration. Cryptogrophy that is stronger than the
   Government's proposed system will be built into the
   Internet by a dozen countries, and American companies and
   individuals would be foolish not to use it.
   At that point, millions of Americans will come into direct
   conflict with Government policy, and the popular
   gun-control bumper sticker may be replaced by one that says
   "If cryptography is outlawed, only outlaws will have
   cryptography."

A response to the quote below from your NIST Key Escrow web I got the full Discussion Paper  with all ten criteria from the main desk, along with others that seemed to be appearing as the day passed. (I'll fax a copies of any of the handouts to anyone wanting hardcopy. We scanned all handouts.)
In breakout session B-2, we were also given only that part of Paper  that dealt with our session's criteria 3, 4 and 9. It was passed out at the end of the meeting after discussion had ceased. We did not get a chance to discuss the "example potential solutions."
Strange procedure: it seemed as if NIST was sleight-of-handing prepared backup papers as if they anticipated resistance. Maybe there would have been more concessions or more rabbits pulled from the KE hat if there had been even louder "brrrrat-GAK."
Never too late to ask for those other trapped bunnies.

      Corona. Everything about it was beyond top secret -- its
      name and history, builders and operators, cameras and
      orbits, photographs and interpreters and, most important
      of all, what it snooped on from space. It was officially
      and assiduously treated for decades as if it did not
      exist. The 95 Corona satellites that successfully
      conducted espionage from 1960 to 1972 turn out to have
      been remarkably advanced tools whose development, far
      from the work of an inner circle, drew on the nation's
      top scientific and industrial talent. More important,
      the new disclosures show just how greatly the craft
      revolutionized Washington's ability to understand its
      cold war friends and enemies.

      Khrushchev, told the Itek conference that one Corona
      film pod dropped into a Russian forest, where
      ax-wielding woodsmen chopped it up. Another spy
      satellite misdirected its film pod into a field in
      central Asia, where peasants wrapped the precious Kodak
      film around poles to provide solitude for a privy.

   In response to an audience question about wiretaps and
   crypto, Mr. Michael Nelson of the White House said at the
   NIST GAK meeting (paraphrased):
      We are not concerned with bad people using crypto among
      themselves, we can handle that. We are more concerned
      with their using crypto to communicate with regular
      folks, to make legitimate arrangements -- finance,
      supplies, travel, and so on -- for their nefarious
      deeds. It's the intermix of the bad with the good that's
      the problem.
   Maybe someone else at the meeting heard this differently
   and will comment, but this seems to mean that the Feds can
   track, and maybe crack, the crypto-intercomm of "bad
   people" so long as it is not buried in a torrent of public
   crypto use. And not commingled with lawful, ECPA-
   protected(?), communication.

   some version will appear in the Federal Register for public

   Security Flaw Is Discovered In Software Used in Shopping
   By John Markoff
   San Francisco, Sept. 18 -- A serious security flaw has been
   discovered in Netscape, the most popular software used for
   computer transactions over the Internet's World Wide Web,
   threatening to cast a chill over the emerging market for
   electronic commerce.
   The flaw, which could enable a knowledgeable criminal to
   use a computer to break Netscape's security coding system
   in less than a minute, means that no one using the software
   can be certain of protecting credit card information, bank
   account numbers or other types of information that Netscape
   is supposed to keep private during on-line transactions.
   The weakness was identified by two first-year graduate
   students in computer science at the University of
   California at Berkeley, who published their findings on an
   Internet mailing list Sunday evening.
   Although the Netscape Communications Corporation, which
   produces the software, said today that the flaw could be
   fixed and that new copies of the software would be
   distributed as early as next week, Internet experts said
   the discovery underscored the danger of assuming that any
   computer security system was safe.
   "There needs to be much more public auditability in the way
   these financial security systems are designed and
   implemented," said Eric Hughes, president of Open Financial
   Networks, a company in Berkeley that is developing Internet
   commerce systems.
   The Netscape software is already used by an estimated eight
   million people for navigating the World Wide Web portion of
   the Internet. On the Web, thousands of companies offer
   text, images, video and audio information, much of it as a
   way of advertising or directly selling goods and services.
   Because the Netscape software is not only easy to use but
   has also been promoted as a secure way of dealing with
   personal and financial information, it has been seen as the
   emerging de facto standard for on-line commerce.
   Already, a diverse group of companies -- including Wells
   Fargo Bank, MCI Communications, Internet Shopping Network
   and Virtual Vineyards -- have adopted Netscape as the
   vehicle for checking bank balances, catalogue shopping or
   buying wine on line.
   Although Internet experts agreed with the company's
   assessment that the flaw could be fixed and that it posed
   no risk to people who use the World Wide Web only to
   retrieve nonsensitive data, the security problem's
   disclosure may represent a public relations setback for
   Netscape Communications and an inconvenience to millions of
   people who may feel a need to replace the version of
   Netscape installed on their computers. Last month the
   company's shares began public trading and had one of the
   most successful first days in Wall Street's history,
   largely on the resounding popularity of the Netscape
   software.
   Today, as word of the security flaw circulated only within
   fairly small circles of Internet users, Netscape's stock
   closed with a slight loss, down 75 cents, to $52.50, in low
   Nasdaq trading volume.
   The company said it would release a repaired version of the
   software within a week. Users will be able to download it
   free over the Internet, through the Netscape site on the
   World Wide Web (
   The company had previously announced a next-generation
   version of Netscape that it said would be more secure than
   the original, and it said today that it would release this
   updated version within the next few weeks. But first it
   will remove the newly disclosed flaw, which is currently in
   the new version.
   "The good news and the bad news of the Internet is that
   when you put something up there, many more people can test
   it," said Mike Homer, the vice president of marketing at
   Netscape. "You also give yourself the opportunity of having
   people point things out which you can fix quickly."
   The company so far has distributed most copies of its
   program free over the Internet, under a strategy of making
   its money from commercial customers who use Netscape to
   provide services or for other business applications over
   the World Wide Web. So replacing the copies will not be an
   expensive undertaking.
   Instead, for Netscape Communications and for other
   companies betting their futures on the Internet, the real
   cost of this disclosure may be in the public's shaken
   confidence in the ability of computer companies to insure
   privacy and security for on-line commerce.
   The weakness in Netscape's security was discovered by Ian
   Goldberg, 22, and David Wagner, 21, two computer science
   students who share an office at the university and who also
   share an interest in the arcane science of cryptography,
   which is becoming increasingly important for business as
   companies begin to explore electronic commerce.
   The two students said they had decided to put the software
   to a test in an effort to raise public concern about
   placing too much trust in unproved electronic security
   systems.
   Netscape's security is based on a type of coding technology
   known generically as public key cryptography in which users
   exchange mathematically generated numbers -- or keys -- to
   encode or decode information. In such systems, a new key is
   created for each information exchange, based on a
   mathematical formula that is combined with numbers
   supposedly known only to the sender or recipient.
   The students found that by determining how Netscape's
   formula generated the number used as a starting point for
   creating a key, they were able to greatly reduce the
   potential combinations that would unlock the code. The
   starting-point number turned out to be based on the time
   and date of the transaction, combined with several other
   unique bits of information taken from a user's computer
   system -- bits of information that an electronic intruder
   could determine, if he were intent on intercepting a
   Netscape user's transactions.
   Knowing how the starting-point number was created greatly
   reduced the other possible components of the formula -- and
   the students found they were able to break the code in a
   matter of seconds using a standard computer work station.
   Netscape officials said today that they would strengthen
   the system, by making it significantly harder to determine
   the random number at the heart of their coding system. They
   said they would no longer disclose what data would be used
   to generate the random numbers.
   The announcement of the flaw was posted Sunday night on a
   computer network mailing list maintained by an informal
   group known as Cypherpunks. The group, which is made up of
   mathematicians, computer experts and privacy advocates, has
   been campaigning for more effective electronic security
   systems.
   The discovery is the second reported security weakness in
   the Netscape program to be posted on the Cypherpunks list
   in the last month. In August, Damien Doligez, a student at
   the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, used a network of 120
   computers, running for eight days, to generate a Netscape
   secret key. But his was a "brute force" attack, requiring
   the computers to sample a vast range of numbers before
   coming up with a key that would break the code.
   The Berkeley students, in contrast, by identifying a basic
   flaw in the way Netscape set up its security system, were
   able to narrowly focus their attack to quickly break the
   code, with far less computer power.

   Netscape Software for Cruising Internet Is Found to Have
   Another Security Flaw
   By Jared Sandberg
   Another security flaw that has long plagued the Internet
   has been found in software by Netscape Communications Corp.
   and others, raising concerns for the privacy and safety of
   information on the global computer network.
   The flaw in Netscape's popular Navigator software, which
   helps users cruise the multimedia portion of the Internet
   known as the World Wide Web, is the third defect in the
   software discovered by the "Cypherpunks" discussion group
   in little over a month. Members of the Cypherpunk group,
   which includes mathematicians and hackers who discuss the
   security method of cryptography, last month broke
   Netscape's "key" that protects sensitive data by "brute
   force" -- the use of massive computing power. Last week,
   other members found a flaw that could let hackers
   essentially pick the lock in Netscape's software.
   Unlike the prior glitches, however, the latest flaw doesn't
   lend itself to the theft of multiple credit-card numbers.
   Instead, it could allow a savvy hacker to damage an
   Internet user's computer, such as crashing the computer or
   deleting files.
   "This is just another indication that Netscape isn't being
   careful," said William Cheswick, a security researcher at
   AT&T Corp.'s Bell Laboratories.
   Still, he said, the flaw goes well beyond Netscape. It
   first reared its head seven years ago when Cornell graduate
   student Robert Morris used it to create a "worm" that
   crippled thousands of computers on the Internet. Last
   February, the same kind of flaw was found in the popular
   Mosaic program created by the University of Illinois. But
   that strain of the flaw was more serious than its latest
   appearance because it affected the computers that store
   many users' credit-card numbers. Now experts are
   discovering that the flaw shows up in other so-called Web
   browsers such as Links and Arena.
   "We're so glad that the network dog dances, we don't
   realize that it's rabid," Mr. Cheswick said of the
   programming quality of many software packages.
   Marc Andreessen, vice president of technology at Netscape,
   said the company will issue fixes for the recent glitches
   later this week. He added that it's unclear whether
   anything other than temporarily crashing a user's computer
   could result trom the recent flaw. But, he said, once users
   adopt the modified software, "this won't be around long
   enough to cause a problem."
   Some, however, worry that another variation of the flaw
   will prove more difficult to cope with in the coming
   months. Bruce Fancher, president of Phantom Access
   Technologies Inc., operator of the Mindvox Internet access
   service, said a variation of the security hole has been
   found in several Unix software packages, which run on
   thousands of Internet computers that contain user's
   credit-card numbers and other personal information. It
   could cause far more damage than the Netscape flaw, he
   said. "This is going to be a big problem," warned Mr.
   Fancher, adding that he's been told that hackers are
   already devising software toolkits to exploit the hole.
   "This flaw is an easy mistake to make, but it's also easy
   to fix," he said.
   The latest flaw came to light early Friday morning when a
   reader of the Cypherpunk mailing list discovered the glitch
   and posted a message to the Internet. Basically, the
   software on an end-user's machine allows for commands that
   are too long, letting an intruder tack on an extra line of
   damaging code that could crash the computer. Instead, the
   software should verify the length of the commands that
   computers accept.
   Security buffs concede that the recent round of security
   glitches found in several pieces of software, including a
   virus found in Microsoft Corp.'s Word program and security
   problems at Amefica Online Inc., has shaken confidence in
   electronic commerce. But they say the publicity brings to
   light problems that will ultimately make software more
   secure. Richard Lethin, a graduate student at
   Massachusettes Institute of Technology who participates in
   the Cypherpunk discussion, said: "This technology for
   electronic commerce is ultimately going to be real
   important, but there might be some hiccups at the start."

      next big thing in computing. Just as popular World Wide
      Web "browser" software like Netscape has transformed the
      Web from a scientist's research tool into a consumer
      medium over the last two years, many computer industry
      researchers and executives predict that the Java
      programming language will transport the Web to the next
      level.

   The F.B.I. Sting Operation on Child Pornography Raises
   Questions About Cryptography
   By Peter H. Lewis
   Federal agents swooped down on more than 125 homes and
   offices across the United States on Sept. 13, seizing
   computers and diskettes from people suspected of
   trafficking in child pornography over the America Online
   network. But to date, the number of arrests in the sting
   operation remains at 15.
   More arrests are expected, but why haven't more occurred?
   Last week, Louis J. Freeh, the director of the F.B.I.,
   offered an oblique explanation for the seemingly low
   initial success rate.
   At least some of the suspected child pornographers had used
   data encryption software, Mr. Freeh said Thursday in
   remarks at an International Cryptography Institute
   conference in Washington. In other words, they had
   scrambled their computer files so that only someone with
   the password -- or with proper code-breaking skills --
   could view the contents.
   Mr. Freeh wisely did not say whether the F.B.I. agents were
   able to decipher the encrypted files seized in the
   investigation. It would be foolhardy, from a
   law-enforcement perspective, to tip one's hand.
   If the head of the F.B.I. acknowledged that his agency was
   powerless to crack a cryptography program like Pretty Good
   Privacy, the stampede for that software on the Internet
   would make the run on Windows 95 look puny.
   From a political perspective, Mr. Freeh's coyness is shrewd
   as well. By making even a subtle suggestion that some child
   pornographers may walk free because of unbreakable
   cryptography, he gains more leverage in seeking
   Government-mandated controls over the use of encryption
   technology.
   Mr. Freeh said that encryption was a "public safety" issue,
   and he said law-enforcement agencies around the world "will
   not tolerate" the use of private data encryption to impede
   investigations. He said encryption had also been
   encountered in the Philippines in a plot to blow up an
   American jet and to assassinate Pope John Paul lI (in that
   case, at least, one can presume the code was cracked.)
   It seems worthwhile to point out that even if the suspects
   in the child pornography sting, called Operation Innocent
   Images, used cryptography, that did not provide evidence
   that they were doing something illegal. Our legal system is
   predicated on the belief that one is innocent unless proved
   guilty, and there is no exception clause for technology.
   "Fortunately we are not yet at the point where the mere use
   of encryption overcomes the presumption of innocence," said
   David Sobel, staff counsel for the Electronic Privacy
   Information Center in Washington.
   Another point to remember is that the F.B.I. identified
   more than 100 suspects, and gathered sufficient information
   to warrant raids, using existing laws and enforcement
   techniques. On the other hand, there is no denying that
   child pornographers use data encryption to keep co-workers,
   family members and police from discovering their secrets.
   "We are involved in a couple of jobs every week resolving
   some kind of a child pornography investigation," said Eric
   K. Thompson, president of Access Data Inc. of Orem, Utah,
   a private company that specializes in cracking encrypted
   files for corporations and Government agencies.
   The Government's elite codebreakers at the National
   Security Administration are prohibited by law from using
   their talents against American citizens. The F.B.I. has its
   own code-breaking experts, but it routinely calls on
   independent experts like Access Data to help on some cases.
   After eight years of breaking into encrypted files, ranging
   from situations involving secretaries who simply forgot
   their passwords for important memos to cases involving
   corporate computer systems that were encrypted by
   disgruntled employees, Mr. Thompson has concluded:
   "Basically, the criminal element is becoming more computer
   literate, and they are discovering encryption. Files are
   becoming more difficult to break."
   Dorothy Denning, an expert in cryptography and a professor
   of computer science at Georgetown University in Washington,
   said she recognized the importance of encryption for
   businesses seeking to protect information. At the same
   time, she said, she also recognized the problems that
   law-enforcement agencies face because of cryptography.
   "So many people had been saying people in law enforcement
   weren't having this problem, and I didn't believe that,"
   Dr. Denning said. So in May, she said, she spent two days
   calling sources at law-enforcement organizations. "I came
   up with over 20 cases -- child pornography, terrorism,
   murder, embezzlement fraud, tax protesters, export
   violations -- and, in some cases, they were able to crack
   it, and others they couldn't," she said.
   What can be done? The Administration's plan is to seek
   voluntary compliance with a "key escrow" plan, which would
   enable citizens to use strong, private cryptography as long
   as a copy of the software "key" were made available to law
   enforcement officials.
   Last week, Mr. Freeh stressed that he preferred a voluntary
   approach. But "if consensus is impossible" on the
   encryption issue, he said, the F.B.I. might consider other
   approaches.
   The debate is certain to heat up as more information about
   Operation Innocent Images becomes known. There are no
   comforting answers, only an echo of advice from a time
   predating the Internet: There is no solution. Seek it
   wisely.

   Hackers Alert Netscape to Another Flaw
   By Bloomberg Business News
   Mountain View, Calif., Sept. 25 -- The Netscape
   Communications Corporation said today that a third flaw had
   been discovered in its Internet access software by a group
   of computer hackers who call themselves the Cypherpunks.
   The hackers -- computer users and mathematicians who try to
   discover weaknesses in computer software and networks --
   found a design flaw that can shut down Netscape's Navigator
   browser software, which helps people travel on the
   Internet.
   Two American college students last week broke Netscape's
   software security code, a design flaw that could jeopardize
   financial transactions done using Navigator. A month
   earlier, a French hacker broke a different Netscape
   security code.
   "We are learning a lot from these problems," said Michael
   J. Homer, vice president of marketing at Netscape. Shares
   of the company, which sold its first stock to the public
   last month, rose $4.25 today to close at $67 in Nasdaq
   trading.
   The latest flaw found by the hacker group is a programming
   error in Netscape software used to navigate the World Wide
   Web, a part of the Internet made up of photos, sounds and
   drawings.

Worth Magazine, October, 1995, has a longish, easy-reading,
   supportive article on David Chaum and digital cash.
      Virtually alone among E-money thinkers, Chaum insists on
      creating anonymity for all transactions -- building a
      tamper-proof system that works just as "real" cash
      always has, from cowne shells to $100 bills. The key, he
      says, is this: Without the spender's say-so, no one
      should be able to trace who paid whom for what, whether
      a transaction takes place online or in a swipe of a card
      at a coffee shop. It's a libertarian approach in tune
      with Chaum's roots in freewheeling communities such as
      Berkeley and Amsterdam -- but it is anathema to control
      freaks like the FBI, the IRS, and corporate information
      marketers.
      Chaum says every digital-cash system but his has the
      potential to be abused or compromised -- and the math
      seems to bear him out. His competitors, however, insist
      their plans will prove plenty secure in practice. They
      dismiss Chaum as an incorrigible purist, a brilliant
      mathematician and innovator whose political views are
      hindering his chances of success.
      Like many in the digital elite, Chaum, an unabashed

      electronic money is just the first consumer use of an
      arcane field he hopes will transform society:
      cryptology, the science of secret codes. In cyberspace,
      these codes can prove a powerful way of shielding a
      person's identity -- or of verifying an identity without
      giving away extra information. Armed with personal
      computers and good software, says Chaum, ordinary people
      will finally have the power to do and say things without
      being tracked by Big Brother.

   Hewlett Lobbies for Its Encryption Plan That Would
   Satisfy Tough Export Rules
   By Don Clark
   Hewlett-Packard Co. is pushing an unusual plan to
   protect electronic transactions around the world
   without running afoul of U.S. export laws.
   The Palo Alto, Calif., computer maker said it has been
   lobbying government agencies for more than a year to
   gain support for its proposal, which uses a
   data-scrambling technology to protect transactions
   from tampering or theft of data. Strong encryption
   technologies ordinarily fall under tough export rules
   that limit technologies which could impede U.S.
   wire-tapping capabilities, a source of continuing
   friction between the government and high-technology
   companies.
   H-P, in a plan developed with the French company
   Gemplus SCA, wants to split the code-making
   technologies into two pieces that would be approved
   under different government standards. One device,
   which could fit in a standard computer, would contain
   a basic encryption capability that is designed to be
   broadly exported without the need to seek a separate
   export license for each foreign user.
   Would Help Industry
   That device, dubbed an encryption engine, would be
   useless without the addition of another tiny piece of
   hardware that contains a code-making formula set at a
   specific strength. The second device, called a policy
   card, would be separately reviewed by the U.S. State
   Department for each customer.
   Government agencies, including codebreakers at the
   National Security Agency, would still have a say over
   the strength of encryption exports. But customers
   could build commercial applications around the
   proposed encryption engine, knowing that it will work
   with any code-making formula that governments might
   adopt in the future. Now they run the risk that their
   work will become obsolete amid policy changes in
   Washington, D.C., and other countries.
   State Department officials weren't immediately
   available for comment. Stewart Baker, a former NSA
   general counsel who now practices law in Washington,
   D.C., termed the H-P plan a clever answer to the
   problem of shifting government policy.
   "There was a lot of skepticism when H-P first proposed
   it," said Lynn McNulty, a former encryption specialist
   at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
   "But it looks to me that they are well on the way to
   the next step."
   H-P Confident of Approval
   Doug McGowan, an H-P manager involved with the
   project, said he expects to receive U.S. approval by
   next year to begin shipping the encryption engine
   freely to Western Europe and Canada. "We believe we
   will receive relaxed export controls," he said.
   H-P's plan fits some of the NSA's objectives. For one
   thing, its technology embeds encryption technology in
   microchips that can't easily be modified by computer
   hackers or terrorists. H-P's policy cards also could
   be adapted for a controversial Clinton administration
   proposal called key escrow, in which mathematical keys
   to break codes could be stored for later use by law
   enforcement or intelligence agencies, Mr. McGowan
   said.
   The plan complements a parallel H-P effort to develop
   a new generation of "smart" data cards to let
   consumers buy goods and services around the world
   electronically. Gemplus, a huge supplier of credit and
   debit cards in Europe, is supplying technology to that
   effort along with Informix Corp., a database software
   maker in Menlo Park, Calif.
   Jeff Hudson, an Informix vice president, said the
   partners' proposed cards could store money and a
   database worth of personal information, such as
   medical records. That approach could eliminate the
   need to connect to multiple companies or agencies to
   manage such information, since it would be stored on
   each card, the companies said.

   Microsoft and Visa Expected to Unveil Internet Technology
   By a WSJ Staff Reporter
   New York -- Microsoft Corp. and Visa International are
   expected to disclose details today of their technology for
   protecting commerce on the lnternet.
   The software company and bank clearinghouse have been
   working since last November on a plan for protecting
   creditcard numbers and other financial data from crooks, a

   Other key players in the Internet-security race include
   MasterCard International Inc., the other name in bank
   cards, and Netscape Communications Corp., a leader in
   Internet software that has suffered some highly publicized
   security lapses lately. MasterCard announced plans to

   Cracks in the code
   Peter Martin calls for an easing of US restrictions on
   the export of encryption technology
   Encryption used to be a subject of interest only to spies
   and mathematicians. But the central role that the
   electronic transmission of information is playing in
   commerce and society make it now a technology of enormous
   practical relevance. Two recent stories out of many
   exemplify this trend.
   Citibank lost $400,000, it is alleged, to a Russian hacker
   who managed to crack its clients' passwords. The solution
   to this security problem: a new generation of encrypted
   passwords that are much harder to crack.
   And Netscape Navigator, the leading "browser" program for
   the Internet's fast-growing World Wide Web, has been shown
   to have flaws in its encryption routine. In theory at
   least, these make it possible for outsiders to read
   encrypted data sent over the net -- such as credit card
   numbers. Netscape acknowledges the problems and says it
   will have fixes available by today.
   Is this crucial technology vulnerable to determined attack
   by hackers and fraudsters?
   Before considering the question, remember that the
   introduction of any new technology highlights risks
   uncomplainingly borne for years. The safety precautions
   demanded of the Channel tunnel are one example, as compared
   with those required of traditional trains or ferries.
   Similarly, it is argued, people have been unhesitatingly
   using analogue mobile phones, reading credit card details
   over the telephone, and sending off faxes into the ether
   without any of the panic that now surrounds the issue of
   Internet security.
   The comparison is an instructive one, but not entirely
   fair. What worries Internet users is not so much that a
   determined enemy might target them for eavesdropping, or
   even that chance might put their credit card details in the
   hands of a dishonest person.
   Instead, they worry about the Internet's unstructured
   nature under which messages are passed from computer to
   computer across the world until they reach their final
   destination.
   In principle, this would allow a criminal to leave a
   "sniffer" program lurking, electronically, at one of the
   nodes, recognising credit card numbers as they passed by,
   and scooping them up for subsequent exploitation. People
   also fear an attack on the computers of merchants selling
   goods over the Internet -- each containing thousands of
   credit card numbers. The fear is thus not one of random
   theft but of systematic brigandage.
   Encryption is all that stops such fears paralysing
   electronic commerce before it has properly begun. It is
   therefore in the general public interest that effective
   encryption be widely available.
   The Netscape problem illustrates how easy it is for the
   inherent mathematical strengths of a modern encryption
   scheme to be overcome by an oversight in its supporting
   plumbing. One of the faults in Netscape's encryption, for
   example, stems from too predictable a method of generating
   the random numbers needed to make the scheme work.
   It also illustrates how, once a code-breaker's task is
   simplified by such a weakness, today's powerful networks of
   cheap computers make it quick to crack even the most
   sophisticated encryption schemes. The narrower the range of
   numbers through which the cracker's computers must sift in
   order to find a meaningful answer, the greater the
   probability of breaking the code within a useful amount of
   time.
   All the more reason, then, for non-Americans to view with
   dismay a US policy which restricts the international
   distribution of the most powerful forms of encryption. For
   national security reasons, the US insists that the version
   of Netscape sold outside North America must contain a
   weaker form of encryption than that available to Americans
   and Canadians.
   The international version is restricted to a 40-digit
   "key", while the North American version uses 128 digits.
   The longer the key, the greater the time and computing
   power required for the code to be cracked. In principle,
   given enough computing power, even a message encoded by a
   very long key could be cracked in time. In practice,
   however, the task of cracking many millions of messages to
   find one that is of interest makes messages secure as long
   as the key has enough digits.
   Amateur code-crackers claim to have broken the 40-digit
   version of the Netscape encryption scheme. Their claim is
   hard to verify. But there is no doubt of the weakness in
   the random-number generation procedure; Netscape has
   verified it.
   This fault is common to both North American and export
   versions of the program, so it does not result from the US
   government restrictions on key length. The occasion reminds
   us, however, that effective encryption is essential to the
   growth of electronic commerce. And it teaches us that
   simplifying the code-breaker's task -- by error in
   Netscape's case, by deliberate diktat in the case of the
   government restriction is an easy way to make transmissions
   vulnerable.
   There was never much justification for the US determination
   to weaken exported encryption products. There is less now.

   Rivalry for Internet Security Grows
   By Louise Kehoe in San Francisco
   The Internet rivalry between Microsoft, the world's largest
   software company, and Netscape Communications increased
   yesterday when they announced competing encryption
   technology intended to ensure the security of financial
   transactions over the global computer network.
   Mr James Clark chairman of Netscape, the leading supplier
   of browser software that enables personal computer users to
   "surf" the Internet, also revealed the company had turned
   down a move by Microsoft to take a minority stake in
   Netscape earlier this year, before Netscape's public
   offering.
   Microsoft's encryption technology, developed with Visa
   International the credit card processing organisation, is
   intended to solve Internet security problems which have
   become a serious barrier to electronic commerce.
   Recent incidents, including the hacking of supposedly
   secure Internet software developed by Netscape, have
   heightened concerns about sending sensitive data such as
   credit card numbers over the Internet.
   Microsoft said its Secure Transaction Technology (STT), was
   designed to provide a much higher level of security for
   credit card transactions on the Internet. Netscape's
   general purpose encryption system uses a 40 or 128-bit
   electronic "key", while STT will use 2,000-bit keys.
   "By Christmas of 1996 you will be able to shop on the
   Internet to your heart's content, without even thinking
   about security," said Mr Warren Dent, Microsoft director of
   business development for consumer systems.
   Although no encryption system was totally secure, Mr Dent
   estimated it would take "25 Cray supercomputers a year" to
   break the STT codes.
   Netscape, however, said a new version of its Navigator
   software, which will become available next week will
   provide the same level of security. Netscape's "Secure
   Courier" technology has been developed in conjunction with
   MasterCard, Visa's credit card rival.
   To encourage widespread adoption of STT, Microsoft and Visa
   are making its technical specifications available at no
   charge to third parties to allow them to develop software.
   Netscape said Microsoft is expecting to charge transaction
   fees each time the STT technology is used.
   Commercial software products incorporating STT are expected
   to be available by April, Microsoft said. Netscape says
   Secure Courier will be available sooner.

   Pioneers of Cyberspace Move Into Wider Arena
   By Peter H. Lewis
   Cambridge, Mass., March 30 -- Cyberspace is dead, many of
   its electronic pioneers said at a conference here this
   week.
   As the Internet population has grown into the millions,
   what was once a small, self-regulating society of academics
   and computer wizards has been engulfed by mainstream
   culture. But in their efforts to preserve the libertarian
   spirit of the electronic frontier, the original members of
   the cyberspace community have emerged as a political and
   social force.
   "Last year, it was still possible for people to say
   cyberspace is a different place, subject to different laws
   and different rules and that there is a Net culture," said
   Hal Abelson, a professor of computer science and
   engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
   here. "Now you have such a large percentage of the
   population on the Net, it just is not sensible to talk
   about this as some other place anymore. What you are really
   talking about now is the communications fabric of the
   country."
   In what was seen as a clear sign of Internet users new
   power, several members of Congress announced, by telephone
   and through the Internet, new legislation and initiatives
   at the gathering here, the annual Computers, Freedom and
   Privacy Conference. The proposals include the formation of
   an Internet Caucus in Congress and a Senate blll to relax
   the Government's laws restricting the transmission of
   secrets over the global information network.
   "Washington is coming to thls conference in droves," said
   Daniel J. Weltzner, deputy dlrector of the Center for
   Democracy and Technology, one of several public-interest
   groups that seek to influence Government policy related to
   cyberspace, "and I think it's very exciting and promising.
   It's the coming of age of this community."
   The members of Congress were wooing more than 500 of the
   Internet's most prominent champions, who had gathered to
   discuss issues that were once esoteric but are now
   affecting millions of people worldwide: questions of
   privacy, electronic copyrights, computer crime, the nature
   of free speech, digital pornography, electronic cash and
   grassroots electronic democracy.
   The Computers, Freedom and Privacy crowd included its usual
   assortment of computer hackers, academics and self-
   described crypto-anarchists, and even one man wearing video
   goggles with an antenna apparently sprouting from his head.
   But it also included others who wanted to assess the fusion
   of cyberspace and real space: Federal judges, lawmakers,
   White House policy experts, corporate executives and
   law-enforcement agents.
   Senator Conrad Burns, a Republican from the real frontier
   state of Montana, chose the conference to announce, by
   telephone, new legislation that would remove nearly all
   current Government restrictions on the export of
   mass-market encryption software, which is used to send
   secret messages over computer and telephone networks.
   Senator Burns's legislation would also block the
   Administration from imposing as a Government standard any
   form of data encryption that would give law-enforcement
   agencies the ability to decode messages.
   The Senator's bill places him squarely at odds with the
   Clinton Administration and the Justice Department. But Mr.
   Burns said the use of robust data encryption would foster
   the rise of electronic commerce, distance education and
   digital communicatlons, which his large, rural state
   desperately needs in the 21st century. While the bill might
   have little chance of passage this year, conference
   participants were heartened by what appears to be growing
   support in Congress for a relaxation of the Government's
   cryptography policy.
   The proposal drew some opposition. "I think we'll regret it
   down the road," said Dorothy E. Denning, a professor of
   computer sciences at Georgetown University and a computer
   security consultant to the military. Dr. Denning and others
   have argued that the use of unrestricted encryption would
   thwart the ability of law-enforcement and intelligence
   agencies to conduct wiretaps on messages sent by foreign
   spies, terrorists, child pornographers and other criminals.
   On Friday, a bipartisan group of wired lawmakers addressed
   the conference by telephone and Internet to announce the
   formation of a Congressional Internet Caucus. Fewer than
   half of all members of Congress are now on line.
   Representative Rick White, Republican of Washington, said,
   "The idea behind the Internet Caucus is to do two things:
   increase members understanding of the Internet and get more
   members on-line so that people can contact their elected
   representatives on the Internet."

   "At the Justice Dept., Big Government Keeps Getting Bigger"
      In the tug-of-war over downsizing the government,
      Republicans and Democrats still willingly take out the
      checkbook when crime is the issue. Over the past 16
      years, a time in which both parties have controlled
      Congress, Justice's budget has grown by nearly 600
      percent and its work force has expanded from about
      55,000 employees to 94,000.
      Justice is only one part of this phenomenal crime-
      fighting growth. Where the federal government once
      relied mostly on the FBI, the federal buildup is
      creating several large police agencies. More than 41,000
      criminal investigators now work for 32 federal agencies.
      "It has grown like Topsy," says former AG Griffin B.
      Bell. "What I worry about is that people with a badge
      many times can't manage power."
      Senior members of Congress with oversight responsibility
      for DoJ say they are considering ways to consolidate
      the government's law enforcement agencies under a more
      centralized command. Among the models under review are
      the JCS, which aerosols DoD hogstench, and the DCI, who

   Peeking at Your P.C. [Op-Ed]
   By Simson L. Garfinkel
   Cambridge, Mass.
   As more Americans use electronic mail, buy products over
   the Internet and keep their most personal records on
   desktop computers, there is increasing demand for
   cryptography software that can insure the privacy of
   personal electronic communication.
   This technology already exists, but the Government, through
   export-control regulations, effectively bars citizens from
   using it.
   The Government classifies encryption software as munitions,
   because foreign countries can use such programs to hide
   their communications during times of war. To prevent this,
   American companies are largely prohibited from selling to
   foreign customers any programs that include strong coding
   features.
   Unfortunately, that has stifled the domestic market.
   Encryption-software developers find it too expensive to
   create two versions of their programs -- one with strong
   cryptography for domestic use and one with cryptography
   that is weak enough for export. So in the United States,
   developers sell only the weaker cryptography software.
   Last month, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced "The
   Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996" to combat
   this problem. But while this measure would increase the
   availability of good cryptography at home, it would limit
   our freedoms in other ways.
   The act would legalize the export of any mass-market
   software if similar technology is already available
   overseas. This would put an end to the futility of
   forbidding such exports at a time when cryptography
   technology is increasingly available around the globe -- in
   libraries and on the Internet. Indeed, the Software
   Publishers Association says that the main result of the
   export regulations simply has been to shift the overseas
   marketing of military-grade cryp tography to foreign
   companies.
   So although the new bill would still prohibit American
   companies from exporting innovative programs, it would at
   least allow them to compete with foreign companies on an
   equal footing.
   However, the Clinton Administration and others oppose this
   minor change, because they are worried that criminals and
   terrorists could use the export liberalization to their own
   advantage.
   Because of this opposition, the bill throws a bone to the
   antiprivacy forces.
   While lifting export controls, it criminalizes some uses of
   cryptography for the first time in our nation's history. It
   would be illegal, for instance, to use encryption that
   interferes with a felony investigation. But the language of
   the bill is so broad that these restrictions could apply to
   a reporter's encrypted computer files.
   The bill also creates legal rules for "key holders" --
   organizations that would be given copies of an individual's
   decryption key, or codebreaker. This means that an
   individual's encoded messages or documents could be
   decoded, under a court order, without his or her knowledge.
   Although the use of key holders would be voluntary under
   the bill, that could easily change and the system could
   become mandatory.
   There is some hope for avoiding all this. Senator Conrad
   Burns, Republican of Montana, plans to introduce a narrower
   bill that focuses simply on liberalizing exports of
   encryption technology.
   The software industry and civil libertarians are already
   supporting this approach -- one that is good not just for
   American business but also for our right to privacy.

Probably the CIA officers are linguists or analysts, maybe even cryptographers, who will be doing that they do at Langley and other US stations: processing foreign (non-US-citizen) intelligence coming into the country from a variety of sources.
These roles would fit this paragraph of the article:

   CIA officers will be stationed alongside officers from the

   Software-Scrambling Proponents Pushing To Ease Export Curbs
   New York -- Champions of encryption software -- computer
   programs that scramble data to thwart eavesdroppers -- this
   week will step up efforts to loosen export restrictions on
   the technology.
   Sen. Conrad Burns (R., Mont.) is expected to introduce
   tomorrow a bill that would ease the federal government's
   export rules. At the same time, industry-trade groups and
   privacy advocates will seek grass-roots support via the
   Internet.
   Current regulations limit the export of encryption software
   to weak systems that are presumed easy for intelligence and
   law-enforcement organizations to crack. The Clinton
   administration has opposed the sale of stronger systems,
   saying terrorists or other foes could use them to conduct
   operations without being monitored.
   But technology executives contend these regulations hamper
   their ability to compete overseas. And because the
   regulations govern any software that incorporates the
   technology to keep data secure, they can impede exports of
   electronic-mail systems, World Wide Web software and other
   Internet-related packages.
   "Right now, the industry is just wondering whether the
   administration will deal with this before we start losing
   market share," said D. James Bidzos, chief executive
   officer of RSA Data Security Inc., a Redwood City, Calif.,
   concern that supplies encryption software.
   The new bill would give software makers free rein to sell
   scrambling systems overseas as long as the same systems are
   widely available in the U.S. Other encryption technologies
   could be exported as well if similar products are already
   generally available outside the U.S.

8-2-96. WaJo:    "More Bombs Are Exploding Across the U.S."       What also worries law-enforcement officials are the       comparatively unspectacular bombs exploding at a rising       rate in neighborhoods across the country. Indeed, with       homicides declining, bombings may have become the       fastest-growing category of violent crime. "In the old       days, kids would break windows," says John O'Brien, an       agent in Washington with the federal Bureau of Alcohol,       Tobacco and Firearms. "Now, they're making pipe bombs."       Police say one of the most popular bombs among       youths -- one combining acid and other ingredients in a       bottle -- is called the "McGyver" because many learned       about it from the television show. David Estenson, head       of a bomb-crisis management firm and former head of the       Minneapolis police bomb squad, observes that many of the       pipe bombs in Israel contain only match heads.    "U.S. Studies Use of Chemical Tracers To Track Explosives    in Terrorist Blasts."       The Treasury Department is studying a family of trace       chemicals -- first developed by U.S. weapons scientists       to track the fallout of nuclear weapons -- as a way to       give terrorist explosives an identifiable trail. The       trace chemicals are newer and much smaller than plastic       "taggants," which have provoked resistance from the       explosives industry and gun lobbies. Desmonde Cowdery,       vice president of Isotag L.L.C., a small Houston company       that has obtained commercial rights to the process,       claims the chemical tracers are so small they can be       blended with all types of explosives, including       fertilizers and gunpowders, without interfering with       chemical reactions.    "Can America Stomach a War on Terror?"       The lessons from the world's battlefields of terror are       sobering. Not only have few countries been able to make       much of a dent in a determined terrorist campaign, but       their efforts also often incur a heavy price.       Due-process rights have been suspended, freedoms of       speech curtailed, police powers beefed up.       Tommy Sands, a Belfast folk singer, praises America's       caution. He says that in Northern Ireland and other hot       spots, authorities have often overreacted to the initial       threat. "It's like driving a car and seeing a red light       come on that means you're short on oil. If you take a       hammer to it, the red light will go out, but you're       still short on oil," Mr. Sands says. "Sometimes there       are answers other than the big hammer."    -----      (19 kb for 3)    Lynx:     BOO_mer

Computer Reseller News, 8-05-96, p. 51    Channel feels pinch of export limitations -- VARs Hit    Encryption Roadblock    By Charlotte Dunlap & Deborah Gage    Could 40 bits of code cost you that multimillion-dollar    bid?    Andrew Sheppard, president of Branford, Conn.-based Espion    Inc., just returned from a frustrating business trip to    Europe, where he said he lost a number of accounts with    financial institutions because he could not deliver    software with more than 40 bits of encryption key length.    Sheppard, who recently tried to sell his encryption wares    to clients in Europe, said he lost business to competitors    offering stronger encryption.    "There is a real demand for this type of product, and yet    I find myself thwarted at every single opportunity by this    stupid law, which everyone realizes is unnecessary,"    Sheppard said.    Sheppard said potential clients that turned him down during    his recent trip included Banco Santander, a Madrid-based    bank; the London office of Credit Suisse; Logica Systems of    London; and the financial reporting arm of Reuters' news    service in London.    As the trend toward networking-sensitive information grows,    woes tied to encryption export limitations are spreading to    the VAR community. The dilemma of shipping overseas    anything other than light versions of security software is    starting to sabotage the efforts of Internet resellers.    Because 40 bits of code is considered to be breakable by an    elementary hacker, major corporations with data to protect    are reluctant to trust U.S. technology. So, U.S. resellers    are being turned away while multinational corporations turn    to foreign technologies.    The debate between business and the U.S. government about    export limitations is getting increasingly heated with the    growth of the Internet. The Pro-Code Bill, which aims to    relax export restrictions, has just been introduced, and    prominent Silicon Valley executives are trekking to    Washington regularly to argue the case. Jim Bidzos,    president and chief executive of encryption market leader    RSA Data Security Inc., Redwood City, Calif., has spent a    lot of time in Washington.    "The big picture in terms of what's happening is all of our    communications and document storage is moving from paper    and filing cabinets to the Internet and disk drives. We    need crypto technology in order to protect this," he said.    But resellers are getting discouraged and do not see a    quick resolution with law makers. Meanwhile, they are    losing business at a staggering rate.    Norm Yamaguchi, director of sales for RSA master reseller    Secure Distribution Inc., said he could have tripled the    size of his million-dollar company this year if it were not    for U.S. export laws dictating a maximum 40-bit key    encryption length to his clients' international offices.    "To say this law is causing me problems is a massive    understatement," Yamaguchi said. The reseller currently is    in talks with Price Waterhouse to get them to standardize    on Oakland, Calif.-based Secure Distribution's security    products, but will likely lose the contract because of the    40-bit key length limitation.    Resellers' fear of losing business to foreign players is    not paranoia, either. The Business Software Alliance has    identified 500 encryption products that can be purchased in    foreign countries. Information about the stronger foreign    technology can be obtained easily through the Internet.    "The laws are punishing U.S. companies, and we're losing    business to foreign countries because they can offer the    same thing. The law is not holding back the flow of    encryption, it is just holding back U.S. companies from    making money," he added, calling it a "lose-lose    situation."    Reseller Al Hill, vice president of engineering for    Successful Systems Solutions, Rancho Cordova, Calif., has    to surrender part of his solutions services in order to    keep his foreign clients.    "We ship units to England, Hong Kong and Singapore, and we    have to downgrade the software [to 40 bits] on all of them.    They were rather upset but smart enough to realize they    could upgrade the security themselves," he said, adding    that he has lost business because he could not complete    projects himself.    "We have to make sure the APIs in the software are    available so people overseas can tie them into their    [security] applications," he said. Similarly, Dave Johnson,    senior account manager of Precision Computers Inc.,    Portland, Ore., said he lost an account with a    multinational company with offices in France because "it    became too troublesome for them to implement U.S. products    because of the legal problems."    Uncle Sam's View    U.S. companies and civil libertarians have been battling    the government since 1991, when the proposal of the Clipper    Chip first surfaced. At that time, the government proposed    splitting the encryption keys and holding a portion of them    in escrow, giving law enforcement officials with court    orders a back door through which to conduct electronic    surveillance. To date, the U.S. government has budged    little from its original idea.    The Clipper Chip idea was squelched, but the government    refuses to concede that strong encryption is not a munition    because it believes national security is at stake. In    recent weeks, Vice President Al Gore proposed a compromise:    The government would extend the types of software that    could be exported, perhaps to include healthcare or    insurance instead of just finance, and allow long keys if    countries where the United States has government-to-    government agreements could hold keys in escrow. A    24-member technical advisory committee is expected to    produce a blueprint for establishing the Federal Key    Management Infrastructure in September.    The Vendor's View    Software executives remain disgruntled with the    government's progress. "Do we really want government-    to-government agreements?" asked Eric Schmidt, Sun    Microsystems Inc.'s Chief Technology Officer. "The U.S. has    protections that other countries don't. France, for    example, is noted for industrial espionage."    Microsoft Corp. Senior Vice President Craig Mundie said an    escrow system would create an expensive bureaucracy,    adding: "This should really be described as a key-leasing    system. This will create a huge new business in extracting    keys from the public. If you want to make sure that your    key is not compromised by law enforcement officials, you're    going to need insurance. There will be a whole service    industry around keys."    Vendors also argue that the government's reasoning is not    legitimate. "The current controls do not keep encryption    out of the hands of the criminals. They keep it out of the    hands of individuals and corporations," said Sybase Inc.    Director of Data and Communications Security Development    Thomas Parenty.    Sun, Microsoft and other companies would like complete    deregulation of encryption. Three bills that would lift    government restrictions and prohibit mandatory key escrow    are working their way through Congress, although none are    likely to pass this year.

The Washington Post, August 7, 1996, p. A6.    CIA Probed in Alleged Arms Shipments       Reports Claim Agents Involved in Arkansas-Nicaragua Drug       Swaps    By Susan Schmidt    The CIA's inspector general is investigating claims that    U.S. intelligence agencies were involved in illegal arms    shipments and drug smuggling at an isolated airstrip in    Mena, Ark., during the years Bill Clinton was governor.    A spokesman for the CIA said Inspector General Frederick P.    Hitz is preparing a report on allegations that the CIA was    involved in arms shipments from Mena to the Nicaraguan    rebels during the 1980s, and that pilots hired by the    agency brought back large shipments of cocaine.    CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said the inspector general    will report on possible contacts between the agency and    Arkansas state officials during the 1980s. His report also    will deal with allegations that the CIA attempted to    influence or curtail law enforcement investigations of    Mena.    Hitz was asked to investigate the Mena airport by CIA    Director John M. Deutch, who was acting on a request from    House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach (R-Iowa).    Leach's panel is looking into the possible laundering of    drug money generated at Mena.    Leach's Banking Committee staff has been looking a variety    of claims about Mena emanating from a collection of    Arkansas law enforcement officials and various figures    operating in the shadowy netherworld on contract with    intelligence agencies.    One congressional investigator likened sorting through the    allegations to being trapped in "a hall of mirrors."    Congressional sources said Leach made the request to the    CIA about six months ago and expects a report from Hitz in    late summer or early fall.    The latest Mena claims are contained in "Boy Clinton," a    book by American Spectator Editor R. Emmett Tyrrell    published this week. In it, Tyrrell asserts that Clinton    knew about CIA operations and cocaine smuggling at Mena.    He cites as sources Arkansas state troopers, including one    on the governor's security detail who says he was also a    contract employee for the CIA during the mid-1980s and    informed Clinton of what was going on at Mena.    Clinton has said he had nothing to do with any activities    at Mena. "Mena is the darkest backwater of the right wing    conspiracy industry," said White House spokesman Mark    Fabiani. "The allegations are as bizarre as they are    false."    [End]

about the covert features of those world-pervasive chips inside? Would Tim tell, could Tim disclose intel, what the world doesn't know about
Intel, about what Intel's hard-headed Moore, the immigrant physicist,
whispers in utmost secrecy to Microsoft's soft-headed Gates, the
American-way coder? Is soft-hearted OS code the front for cold-hearted

do Apple insiders know that the world needs to know about the deals of

Labs of Advanced Technology has developed a way for       people to make long-distance calls over the Internet       using only their telephones, at about half the price of       ordinary toll calls. Customers would merely call a       central number, then dial their long-distance numbers.       The call is carried on the Internet, then put back onto       the local phone system at its destination. The company       plans to charge 5 to 8 cents per minute for all domestic       U.S. calls, which represents a 50 to 75 percent discount       off most domestic long-distance rates. International       rates would depend on arrangements made with foreign       phone companies.

 ---------    Dear Mr. Collin,    Thank you for writing. And for the cyber-terrorism hoot,    which helps purge ignorant fears with insightful    laughter.    The best way I know for citizens to ease their induced-    panic of terrorism in all forms -- gov, com, edu, org --    is to become more informed. And to be wary of "terrorist    threats" in all their burgeoning guises -- "national    security" being one of the most deceitful.    To counter Nat Sec snake oil in the rising commerce in    "cyber-terrorism" (a residue of the natsec oil tank)    citizens should participate in the wit and wisdom of    wide-open Internet mail-lists dealing with computer    privacy and security.    The best of these is the list Cypherpunks. (E-mail "info"    to majordomo at toad.com.)    Cypherpunks, far more tolerant and less treacherously    commercially self-serving than all others, explores an    amazing range of CompSec issues, technologies, policies,    strategies and fantasies. Its archive of several years    offers a historical treasure on the transformation of    state control of comp tech to its service of the    citizenry.    This is exemplified by Cypherpunks primary focus,    cryptography, and the diverse ways it has moved from    narrow use to conceal privileged power to widespread    application to protect individual privacy (especially    those dissenting to heirarchical authority -- gov, com,    edu, org).    Your agent provocateurist comedy on cyber-terrorist    inebriation could be enriched by hanging on Cypherpunks,    say, your buffoonery for secret briefing. "If you knew    what I knew" is a natsec-butt joke there, as it is    becoming globally to liberated citizen-units bellowing    "FA."    Congrats on exposing TLA-dementia of cyber-terrorism and    defanging its counter-agents by encouraging belly-    laughing at the all-too-blatant hype-artistry.

Over the years, terrorists have demonstrated frightening       expertise in making bombs and concealing them. "The fact       of the matter is that we found out terrorists could       create bombs that were very, very difficult to detect,"       says the FBI.       "A fairly small amount, well placed, can do the job,"       said Dr. Jimmie Oxley, of the NRC's airline security       committee. "A colleague once said he could do it with a       gram, in the right place."       Bomb-making technology continually advances, as Israeli       authorities discovered in 1986 when they intercepted a       suitcase being smuggled in from the Gaza Strip. The       terrorists appeared to have spun the suitcase on a       centrifuge that allowed the plastic explosive to flow       into its corners and virtually disappear.       Ariel Merari, who has studied hundreds of terrorist       incidents, says bombers are limited only by their own       imaginations when it comes to building bombs and finding       ways to get them aboard airliners. "However," he said,       "the use of sophisticated bombs are more likely to be       the work of state-sponsored terrorism than anything       else."    -----      (11 kb) Via:     HYS_ter

Network World, August 26, 1996, Page 1    Key-escrow firewall ready to leave the country    by Ellen Messner, Washington D.C.    After months of talk about exporting encryption software,    there will finally be action.    Fulfilling the Clinton Administration's vow to end export    restrictions on strong encryption products if they use    key-escrow features, the U.S. government this week is    expected to permit Trusted Information Systems, Inc.    (TIS) to sell its Data Encryption Standard (DES)-equipped    Gauntlet firewall overseas.    Such exports will allow U.S.-based companies to    standardize on an encrypting firewall for all global    operations.    The Department of Commerce is granting mass-market export    status to a specific version of the Gauntlet firewall    based on a key-escrow scheme that gives U.S. law    enforcement access to a master key for decrypting IP    datastreams.    The master key for each firewall will reside at Oakland,    Calif.-based Source Files, Inc., the third-party private    key holder chosen under the government's groundbreaking    plan.    Vice President Al Gore has supported the Defense    Department's view that unbreakable encryption should be    controlled because it is a powerful weapon and subject to    misuse by criminals and terrorists. However, Gore    recently said the government will allow mass export of    64-bit encryption products if they use key escrow. The    agreement with TIS is the first evidence that the policy    is being put into practice.    Until now, few companies other than banks could get the    State Department and National Security Agency (NSA) to    let them export 56-bit and higher Data Encryption    Standard (DES) products. Only 40-bit products, easily    broken with available computer resources, were allowed    for mass-market export.    "We're on the verge of a major shift," said TIS president    Steve Walker last week. TIS expects to unveil a raft of    other vendors in the network industry that will license    the TIS data recovery method for accessing data encrypted    with a session key.    The government is also considering approving other third-    party keyholders in addition to Source File, which has    traditionally held source code in escrow on behalf of    companies worried about the long-term viability of their    suppliers.    Just say no    Not all are key-escrow converts, however. In fact, it is    painfully clear that corporations will continue to balk    at the prospect of their encryption keys being held by a    third party or the government.    Netherlands-based Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., with    hundreds of subsidiaries and offices all over the world,    is looking to ditch dedicated private lines and send    encrypted IP traffic over the Internet instead.    The State Department's mass-market license for the    Gauntlet means TIS can compete to provide Royal Dutch    Petroleum with its encrypting firewall. But Homayoon    Tajalli, TIS vice president, acknowledged that the Dutch    oil conglomerate is unwilling to hand its encryption keys    over to Source File.    Hence, as part of negotiations with the U.S. and Dutch    governments, Royal Dutch Petroleum agreed to operate its    own data recovery center for the Gauntlet master keys.    Royal Dutch Petroleum would hand over the master    encryption keys to to Dutch law enforcement, which in    turn would give the keys to U.S. authorities "if the    government shows up with a valid warrant," Tajalli said.    TIS went to great lengths to broker the international    arrangement, and hopes that not every firewall export    will entail such laborious negotiations.    Some firewall users are extremely ambiguous about the    government's key-escrow plan.    "I'm not sure I want the government to have that    ability," said Doug Miller, information systems manager    at Bluestone Corp. "At all cost, we've got to keep the    government out of business operations."    [End]    Thanks to BC.

Dear Mr. Young:
I am writing to you as general counsel of Telecommunications
Industry Association ("TIA") which, as you may know, is
engaged in the formulation and publication of standards in
the communications field. At the request of our client, on
November 26, 1996, I accessed your WEB site and both viewed
and printed out a list of links to documents dealing with
encryption. Among them were documents described as a CAVE
Report, CAVE Table and a CAVE Algorithm dated November 20
and November 21, 1996.
In this fashion I was also able to view and print out the
algorithm document of TIA's Committee TR45.3, with a clear
statement that the information in the document may be
subject to the export juristiction of the U. S. Department
of State under the applicable regulations.
The posting on the WEB site of these documents is, in our
opinion, a violation of the copyright of TIA and unlawful.
Furthermore, the posting of the algorithm may constitute a
violation of applicable export regulations. It seems in any
event that it will be a violation under regulations to be
drafted pursuant to the President's Executive Order of
November 15, 1996 which was also accessed by me on your WEB
I returned to the site last Friday and yesterday, December 2
and noticed that these documents are no longer there. I
commend you removing them, but ask for your assurances that
they will not be posted again. In addition, it is important
that we know how you received this documentation which is
strictly restricted in its circulation.
I would appreciate hearing from you at your very earliest

Mr. Vishny and I spoke about his fax. I said that the CAVE-
related documents would not be reposted on my Web site, and
that TR45.3 had come by anonymous mail, as have others we've
published. Mr. Vishny said TIA intended to take no action on
this matter but its members must abide NDA.
Don't know what the Feds will do with Susan Hoyler's

Compromise on Encryption Exports Seems to Unravel
"We really feel that there has been a bait and switch situation and I'm not going to be silent about it," said Roel Pieper, chief executive and vice chairman of Tandem Computers. A Nov. 15 executive order that transferred export oversight to Commerce contained several new wrinkles that even previous industry supporters consider potential deal breakers. For one thing, the Justice Department would play a consulting role to the Commerce Department, which industry executives see as giving law-enforcement officials too big a role in the export process. And they contend that the order prescribes a system that might enable law-enforcement officials to unscramble messages while they are being transmitted, rather than after the fact, as the IBM compromise had seemed to specify.

   Communications, Military -- Technological aspects;    Electronic countermeasures Abstract: The information revolution is leading to the rise of network forms of organization, with unusual implications for how societies are organized and conflicts are conducted. "Netwar" is an emerging consequence. The term refers to societal conflict and crime, short of war, in which the protagonists are organized more as sprawling "leaderless" networks than as tight-knit hierarchies. Many terrorists, criminals, fundamentalists, and ethno-nationalists are developing netwar capabilities. A new generation of revolutionaries and militant radicals is also emerging, with new doctrines, strategies, and technologies that support their reliance on network forms of organization. Netwar may be the dominant mode of societal conflict in the 21st century. These conclusions are implied by the evolution of societies, according to a framework presented in this RAND study. The emergence of netwar raises the need to rethink strategy and doctrine to conduct counternetwar. Traditional notions of war and low-intensity conflict as a sequential process based on massing, maneuvering, and fighting will likely prove inadequate to cope with nonlinear, swarm-like, information-age conflicts in which societal and military elements are closely intermingled.

@_subject: FIPS key recovery meeting (long) 
Forward from: cyberia-l at LISTSERV.AOL.COM
        John Taber and I attended the first meeting of the technical
advisory committee to develop a Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIP) for the federal "key management infrastructure."  The meeting was
held December 5 and 6, 1996 near the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.  Although
the official documents referred only to "key recovery" instead of "key
escrow", representatives used both terms interchangeably.
        The committee is an advisory body to the Dept. of Commerce. Its
recommendations pass through the National Institute of Technical Standards
(NIST).  The charter states membership will be no more than 24, so the ten
"federal liaisons" present are apparently not considered members of the
committee.  The chairman is Stephen Kent, chief scientist for information
security at BBN Systems.
        The other members of the committee were employees of various
computer and computer-security firms, including Sun Microsystems,
Microsoft, Intel, Lucent Technologies, Cisco Systems, Digital Equipment,
IBM and Motorola.  Some security related firms were Trusted Systems,
GlobalKey, and CygnaCom.  Officials from Chase Manhattan Bank and Visa
were also present.  The only academic member was Dorothy Denning of
Georgetown University.
        The government liaisons included Michael Gilmore of the FBI, Jan
Manning of NSA, and representatives of NIST, the Federal Reserve Bank, and
the Defense Information Systems Agency.  Some representatives were from
agencies having no apparent need for cryptography, and therefore key
recovery, such as the Small Business Administration and the Social
Security Administration.  Kent later questioned why the SBA would need key
recovery when it had no need to store encrypted data.  SSA needs
encryption only when it receives confidential information over insecure
        Mary Good of the Commerce Department opened the meeting with a
speech charging the committee to develop a federal key-recovery standard
that can be extended to "public policy".  Good urged the committee to
confine itself to technical issues only, and arrive at a standard that
could be implemented and would not be merely theoretical.  Good also asked
for "transparency" in key recovery, and a couple of the government
liaisons mentioned this as well.  Kent's opening remarks included the
comment that the FIPS would only deal with crypto key recovery, not
recovery of digital signatures, or with public key certification.
        Most of the rest of the first day was taken up with introductions
and comments by the members and liaisons.  The general tenor of comments
from corporate representatives was that key recovery had not been
important to their customers, and while they did not oppose a key recovery
standard for the government, they did oppose any effort to make it
mandatory or make it a requirement for export.  Some differed on whether
an export requirement would be a problem.
        Some typical comments follow.  GlobalKey (which runs a private
encrypted mail system) said using key escrow would be against is policy,
and its customers would not accept it.  Oracle stated it had had no
requirement for key escrow from customers and saw no need for key escrow
from its customers.  It supported software-only solutions, and emphasized
they must have no classified content.  Motorola stated it was important
not to impact the performance of wireless systems.  Motorola advocated an
open system supporting multiple algorithms and opposed the trusted
third-party concept.  Microsoft said it was pragmatic, willing to provide
key recovery if customers want it, but it definitely does not want it
mandated, nor tied in with export licensing.  The Digicom member assumed
the committee was not concerned with individual privacy rights vis-a-vis
the corporate employer's power to recover an employee's encrypted message.
        Jan Manning of NSA and Patricia Edfors of Treasury said the
government had a corporate interest in key recovery like any other
business, as well as for national security or law enforcement purposes.
Manning agreed there was no place in the FIPS for concern over individual
privacy rights and urged the committee to avoid privacy issues.
        Kent said another issue the committee would face was the
timeliness of any response required to a key-recovery request.  Gilmore of
FBI says the FBI's need for timeliness would vary, depending on the
investigation.  Denning said that data other than law-enforcement related
messages could need timely recovery, citing encrypted medical data, or
encrypted data from some kind of sensor.  Another parameter for timeliness
would be the number of requests made in a given time.
        Although the issue was not explicitly debated, the commercial
members seemed to feel that key recovery should be directed to stored
data, while the government representatives were clearly using the term to
cover both stored data and communications.  Someone asked how session keys
in a communication system were archived, and Denning remarked she didn't
know of any system which archived session keys.  The following morning,
Kent said the issues included key recovery for storage, key recovery for
communications, and key recovery for staged delivery (email).  This seemed
to remove the doubts some members had about the scope of the proposal.  We
were left wondering how key archiving could possibly work in
communications networks.  Consider a system where encrypted packets arrive
in any order, with different keys and different key expirations.
        After a commenter asked for clarification of who the users of the
new standard were assumed to be, Kent stated:  "The government wants the
FIPS so that industry will produce products that government can use, and
others will use as well."  When another commenter pointed out that a user
could defeat a key-recovery system with superencryption or other means,
Kent said "...we have to be willing to let [that case] slip through the
        Some participants attempted to distinguish between key backup and
key recovery, the latter being the case where the parties to the
communication are themselves unwilling to give up keys.  Denning responded
that "key recovery _is_ backup."  The distinction seems to be about who is
a party to the communication--the corporation whose employee has lost his
keys, or the employee himself.  Confusion on this point may exist because
the members didn't distinguish the case where an entity using key recovery
doesn't care about it in particular cases, but another entity, government,
very well might.
        Kent asked if the new standard should require a data recovery
field in encrypted messages or files, and if so, should there be check for
integrity of this field.  Requiring a recipient to check this would
encourage senders to use the standard.  Someone asked how a recipient
could check if a sender were, in fact, escrowing data, even if the field
were present.  Others said requiring a data-recovery field would make
compatibility difficult for older systems, or "...those choosing not to
use key recovery."  Some expressed concern for the impact on system
performance of sending extra bits.  Miles Smid of NIST once referred to
the data-recovery field as a "LEAF," invoking some laughter from those
recalling Clipper's "law-enforcement access field."
        Following a question on interoperability with systems not using
the standard, Manning of NSA said the new export law required products to
interoperate only with products using key recovery.  This brought some
irritated responses from the commercial members.   One asked if the
government had some bottom line the committee would have to accept if
there were to be a FIPS.  Manning said NSA had some requirements, and he
assumed the FBI did as will.  Kent suggested the government side put
together a position paper.  A member then asked who the customers of FIPS
were supposed to be; given the government's special requirements, why was
industry input even needed?  Smid of NIST said industry input was needed,
or no one would build systems for the government to use; also, the
government may be involved in key recovery in commercial systems where
"...public safety is involved."  (It seemed plain that "public safety" in
this committee is a code word for "law enforcement").
        Kent suggested that if private parties want to operate
key-recovery services (apparently meaning escrow services), they would
have some negligence defense if they used a federal standard.
        On the following day, December 6, Dorothy Denning presented a
high-level schematic of key recovery associated with key fields and
encrypted data.  The schematic was thrown together the night before.  She
promised to make it available on her web page
        Patricia Edfors of Treasury spoke about federal public key
infrastructure pilot projects.  She also described an "Emergency Access
Demonstration Project," which was to "demonstrate the viability of key
recovery, as a security service, for federal business applications."  The
project is to last 9-15 months, beginning August 1996.  There will
apparently be participation between certain government agencies and some
private firm.  Edfors said no attempt would be made to recover digital
signature keys, create a key management infrastructure, or mandate which
cryptography is used.  However, "export requirements" will apply to all
        Kent wondered why the government would need key recovery for
itself. He seemed to feel that key recovery for an individual's worksation
is a data protection issue (backups) rather than true key recovery.
Members mentioned a few cases where an employee was unable to decrypt his
files, but no one knew of a case where an organization was unable to
obtain shared data (e.g., a database), because it was encrypted.  Other
members seemed reluctant to accept his distinction.  They seem to view key
recovery as a way to audit proper use of organization assets by employees,
or to protect the organization from malicious acts of employees, or to
recover data if a custodian is run over by a bus.
        Discussions continued to frame the issues for the project and
assign functional tasks for sub-committees.  Gilmore of the FBI said most
key-recover issues would arise (for law enforcement) in the context of
search warrants, not wiretaps, although the latter could be very
important.  In a question as to how long escrowed or archived keys should
be kept, Gilmore said as long as the data existed, which might be
indefinitely.  When pressed, Gilmore said this was because some crimes
have no statute of limitation.  We thought some members might be mentally
calculating storage requirements for session keys in a large
communications system, if key storage and indexing was to be indefinite.
        Manning of NSA said the National Archives, for example, would have
to have access to recovery keys forever.  No one asked why the National
Archives might be archiving encrypted data.
        Boland of GlobalKey also asked about keys to encrypted voice or video.
No one seemed to have thought of this before.
        Kent wrapped things up with a list of issues for discussion at
the next meeting.  These included:
        --the threat model
        --interoperability
        --key recovery agents
        --performance issues, computation and bandwidth
        --algorithm independence
        --enforcement measures
        The next meeting will be held in the San Francisco area on
February 19 and 20, 1996.  Before then the members will confer by email
and attempt to set up working groups to present papers on particular
        The meeting ended with an opportunity for public comment.  None
was offered.
        Our opinion was that the only reason for the existence of this
project was the insistence of the government, primarily the law
enforcement and state security agencies.  Private industry seems to feel
there is little demand for a key-recovery standard, since those needing it
can implement it themselves.  Industry representatives were obviously
worried about export restrictions requiring key escrow, and possible
attempts to make it mandatory in some way.  As corporations use encryption
more and more, there will obviously be a need to develop key recovery
systems inside the firm.  The justification for a federal standard,
however, seems weak.
        We felt that this project would probably end in failure, through
inability of the industry and government parties to compromise, or if a
standard did issue, few private firms would use it.  It's even doubtful
a standard could be completed and adopted before private systems are
firmly in place.  Is the whole thing just more of the government's
increasingly delusional effort to control private cryptography, or does
someone besides the security agencies really want a standard?

  "Internet Markets: Emerging Business Models"
  By Dan Yurman
  December 11, 1996
  Abstract
  What are business models for profiting on the net?
  Perhaps the best metaphor to describe Internet business   is that it is like the California gold rush of 1849. A   wave of entrepreneurial start-ups have entered the field,   but all are struggling to find the gold. The miners are   going broke while the saloon and general store owners,   and the brothels, are prospering. Anyone who wants to   make real money in mass markets is going to have to   break the mold of "business as usual" and offer real   value which is not available offline. Meanwhile,   business-to-business commerce is growing using the   time-based value of data exchange as a pricing mechanism.
  This brief paper considers the business models and   related success factors which favor profitability for   doing business on the Internet. It addresses four areas:
  + Mass Markets
  + Business-to-Business Markets
  + Online Banking
  + Advertising

The  microprocessor can be programmed to monitor all traffic being  routed to the PC's hard disc drive.

What was never certain in Phil's case, I believe, is how the
code got out of the US. Whether it was deliberately sent outside the
US by someone, or just made available on a US site which was accessible from outside the US.
The TIA lawyer who wrote me about TR453 indicated that there has
been legal dispute about whether mere placement of ITAR-regulated code on a US site, accessible from outside the US, means that
the code has been exported by the person placing it there (as I did
with the CAVE code on an AOL server in Virginia), or whether the
export is done by an accessor who is usually not be subject to US law.
The new regs intend to close that loophole, as Peter Junger states, and
as the TIA lawyer also indicated, that is, to codify the illegality of putting such code on a site accessible from "outside" the US, or by a "non-US person" inside the US. Heretofore, regulation has been by jaw-boning (as the TIA lawyer jaw-boned me about copyright villation of the uncopyrighted TR453).
This is the point about two definitions of geography in conflict -- physical
and electronic -- and how state-oriented law is attempting to assert control of the cyber-dissolving national borders. Similar to the struggle over electronic dissolution of intellectual property.
As a speaker noted in a recent Congressional crypto hearing: government-
aggressive law of cyberspace aims to define a nation's borders well beyond physical territory. As similarly argued against allowing "non-US persons" to
study regulated crypto in Professor Junger's class.
As others have noted here, other loopholes of by electronic reality are being closed by the new regs, even if First Amendment transgression But I'm not sure that the lawyers are not condemned to trail the leading edge of technology, as ever -- in crypto-munitions as in First Amendment and intellectual property betrayals, misrepresentations and rear guard actions.
Reading the new crypto export regs and comparing them to earlier incarnations is instructive. Observe those insertions of bits and bytes of contortinate intellectual labor -- never quite able to get the legilation to fit all the
looming permutations of technology -- unable, that is, to stitch the wounds of the stumbling, flailing superpower, unsure where the foe is located who is mortally undermining faith in the physical prowess of the keepers of the privileges.
Those vaunted inside secrets of nuclear-munitioned cops don't sell so well these days when the donut-dippers cannot be sure how to distinguish insiders from outsiders, and whose really in control of the armaments keys of keys.
Whole lot of shifting of alliances going on, from State to Commerce, or so I read in the quagmire regs.

@_subject: NYT: Faulty Crypto Policy 
The New York Times, December 16, 1996, p. A14.
   Another Faulty Encryption Policy [Editorial]
   The Clinton Administration has issued its third plan in as
   many years to keep powerful encryption programs for
   telephone and computer messages out of the hands of
   international terrorists and criminals. But this latest
   plan to control the export of encryption software, like the
   two before it, is unworkable and risks trampling on privacy
   rights and harming American software firms.
   Encryption in the hands of criminals unquestionably makes
   law enforcement hard. But the greatest use of encryption is
   by banks and other legal businesses that need to transmit
   confidential data without fear of interception. In
   legitimate hands, encryption helps to prevent crime.
   The Administration first sought to steer all Americans
   toward an encryption standard that Washington would design,
   thus preserving the Government's ability to tap phone
   calls. But after sharp criticism of Government snooping,
   the Administration retreated to a policy, still rejected by
   most privacy advocates and software firms, aimed at exports
   of encryption programs. The newly released regulations,
   which were supposed to implement the October policy, in
   fact make a flawed policy even worse.
   The one consistent thread through the Administration's
   plans is commitment to an encryption standard that uses
   mathematical "passwords" to scramble messages. The
   Government would then have the technical capacity to
   recover passwords, upon court order, and unscramble the
   phone or computer message.
   But the new policy will not succeed abroad. The
   Administration insists it needs not only to unscramble
   stored computer files but also to tap phone and computer
   messages, without the caller's knowledge, as they are
   transmitted. That would in effect require the foreign
   purchaser of American software to deposit its passwords
   with a reputable outside party -- a government agency, a
   bank or the computer firm from which it bought the software
   -- which would relinquish them upon court order and without
   notifying the user. What foreign company or individual will
   purchase software that is prey to undisclosed Government
   snooping when they can, buy equally powerful encryption
   from foreign firms that offer no such path for
   eavesdropping?
   The plan runs into other insolvable problems. It does not
   propose prohibiting powerful encryption software for
   domestic purchase, where such programs are constitutionally
   protected and already in wide use. Thus anyone could, with
   a few key strokes, send the domestically available programs
   over the Internet to Europe and beyond.
   The Administration also fears that software firms will
   write their programs so that the powerful domestic versions
   communicate readily with the easier-to-tap export products.
   If so, the technical result would be that criminals here
   and abroad could communicate out of reach of Government
   wiretaps. The Administration proposes to solve that problem
   by prohibiting software firms from providing easy
   communication between their domestic and export products.
   But that would make American export encryption programs
   unsellable abroad.
   A panel of the National Research Council recommended that
   Washington drop export restrictions on encryption software
   already available abroad, beef up the F.B.I.'s ability to
   crack private encryption codes and support private efforts
   to develop high quality encryption to stop illegal
   eavesdropping. Those steps will improve communications
   security and will not put Government law officers in
   corporate boardrooms, open E-mail to instant wiretaps or
   send foreign customers toward European and Asian software
   firms.

Well done, Lucky.
This is what's needed to kick off a lot of commentary during the next
45-days. Backed by research, to be sure. The outpouring of such
commentary on the full EAR from May 1995 to March 1996 shaped the
final document, and that process is an excellent case study for how
to affect the final form of the latest crypto regs.
It's worth perusing the full EAR in the Federal Register: March 25, 1996 (Volume 61, Number 58), Pages 12713 et seq. for 325 pages (well over a 2.5MB -- it's also on our site, see URL below).
Here's the portion of the EAR that Lucky and Kutz discussed:
[Page 12805]
Sec. 744.6  Restrictions on certain activities of U.S. persons.
    (a) General prohibitions--(1) Activities related to exports. (i) No U.S. person as defined in paragraph (c) of this section may, without a license from BXA, export, reexport, or transfer to or in any country other country, any item where that person knows that such item:
    (A) Will be used in the design, development, production, or use of nuclear explosive devices in or by a country listed in Country Group D:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (B) Will be used in the design, development, production, or use of missiles in or by a country listed in Country Group D:4 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR); or
    (C) Will be used in the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons in or by a country listed in Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (ii) No U.S. person shall, without a license from BXA, knowingly support an export, reexport, or transfer that does not have a license as required by this section. Support means any action, including financing, transportation, and freight forwarding, by which a person facilitates an export, reexport, or transfer without being the actual exporter or reexporter.
    (2) Other activities unrelated to exports. No U.S. person shall, without a license from BXA:
    (i) Perform any contract, service, or employment that the U.S. person knows will directly assist in the design, development, production, or use of missiles in or by a country listed in Country Group D:4 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR); or
    (ii) Perform any contract, service, or employment that the U.S. person knows directly will directly assist in the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons in or by a country listed in Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (3) Whole plant requirement. No U.S. person shall, without a license from BXA, participate in the design, construction, export, or reexport of a whole plant to make chemical weapons precursors identified in ECCN 1C350, in countries other than those listed in Country Group A:3 (Australia Group) (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (b) Additional prohibitions on U.S. persons informed by BXA. BXA may inform U.S. persons, either individually or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required because an activity could involve the types of participation and support described in paragraph (a) of this section anywhere in the world.
    Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. However, the absence of any such notification does not excuse the exporter from compliance with the license requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Definition of U.S. person. For purposes of this section, the term U.S. person includes:
    (1) Any individual who is a citizen of the United States, a permanent resident alien of the United States, or a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3);
    (2) Any juridical person organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States, including foreign branches; and
    (3) Any person in the United States.
    (d) Exceptions. No License Exceptions apply to the prohibitions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (e) License review standards. Applications to engage in activities otherwise prohibited by this section will be denied if the activities would make a material contribution to the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons, or of missiles.

@_subject: TWP on Indecency Protest 
The Washington Post, February 5, 1996, p. A8.
   Language on 'Indecency' Sparks Telecommunications Bill
   Protest
   By John Schwartz
   Provisions in the overhaul of the nation's
   telecommunications laws that call for regulating adult
   materials on the Internet have sparked a storm of anger and
   protest on that medium.
   "This is the kind of legislation you'd see from a lot of
   senators and congressmen who have never logged on," said
   Michael Godwin, staff counsel for the Electronic Frontier
   Foundation, a civil liberties group. "The Christian Right
   thinks they've hit a home run here, but the inning isn't
   over."
   The provisions, proposed by Sen. J. James Exon (D-Neb.),
   have gained momentum with support from religious
   conservative organizations. The legislation would make it
   illegal to make "indecent" material available to minors via
   computer, with penalties of two years in prison and up to
   $250,000 in fines. Exon called passage last week "a victory
   for children and families," adding, "We've come to a
   successful closing of the 'peep show' doors to our youth."
   President Clinton has said he will sign the bill.
   Those opposed to the regulations, however, said the
   "indecency" standard, which has been used in broadcast
   regulation cases, is too vague and would seriously restrict
   the potential of the emerging on-line medium.
   "I am concerned this legislation places restrictions on the
   Internet that will come back to haunt us," said Sen.
   Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.). He warned that quoting from such
   works as "Catcher in the Rye" and "Ulysses" in on-line
   discussions could court prosecution and said that making it
   illegal to "make available" indecent language would outlaw
   posting of messages or images that a child might see.
   "Imagine if the Whitney Museum ... were dragged into court
   for permitting representations of Michelangelo's David to
   be looked at by kids."
   But John McMickle, an aide to Sen. Charles E. Grassley
   (R-Iowa), said drafters rejected the idea that Userious
   works of redeeming value" would fall within the law, which
   he said would apply only to "patently offensive" material.
   McMickle said the bill "is not a Comstock-type effort to
   wipe out literature or political speech."
   The American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier
   Foundation and other organizations are preparing a lawsuit
   challenging the indecency provisions on constitutional
   grounds. Other legal actions are in the works. An on-line
   publication, American Reporter, has announced it will soon
   publish a column by a Texas judge denouncing the
   legislation intentionally salted with "indecent" language;
   Randall Boe, a Washington attorney for the American
   Reporter, said he would immediately sue after publication.
   "We want to move promptly to have this statute set aside as
   unconstitutional," Boe said. "The longer it's in place, the
   greater the harm done to the Internet and to the First
   Amendment." Boe's firm, Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin &
   Kahn, was defense council in the landmark "seven dirty
   words" case, which set the legal standard for indecent
   language in broadcasting based on a monologue by comedian
   George Carlin.
   Cathleen Cleaver, director of legal studies for the Family
   Research Council, said yesterday she expected such suits
   and that her conservative organization, which has pushed
   for on-line regulation, would fight to uphold it.
   The Justice Department has stated that the legislation
   would be vulnerable to attack on constitutional grounds.
   But in response to a letter from Grassley, Assistant
   Attorney General Andrew Fois noted last week that the

   China, U.S. Firm Challenge U.S. On Encryption-Software
   Exports
   By Don Clark
   RSA Data Security Inc., the dominant supplier of
   data-privacy software, announced an unusual partnership
   with the Chinese government that exploits loopholes in U.S.
   export restrictions on codemaking technology.
   As part of the deal, RSA, which is based in Redwood City,
   Calif., plans to fund an effort by Chinese government
   scientists to develop new encryption software. The
   Chinese-developed software, based on RSA's general
   mathematical formula, may be more powerful than versions
   now permitted for export under U.S. Iaws, said James
   Bidzos, RSA's president.
   Two Chinese agencies also will use and distribute RSA data
   encryption products that may be legally exported from the
   U.S. The Chinese encryption-development arrangement, which
   isn't based on those products, appears to be legal as long
   as RSA doesn't supply the scientists with any other
   controlled technology, lawyers familiar with export laws
   said.
   RSA's move comes at a sensitive time in U.S.-China
   relations, and opens a new front in the company's
   long-running campaign against encryption export
   regulations. The closely held company, and other U.S.
   software concerns, have attacked the Clinton administration
   and the National Security Agency for trying to limit the
   strength of exported U.S. technology, while stronger
   products increasingly can be purchased from competing
   foreign companies.
   "The government has opened export doors a crack, and we
   sort of drove a Mack truck through them," Mr. Bidzos said
   of the Chinese deal. "The genie is truly out of the
   bottle."
   Stewart Baker, a Washington lawyer and former general
   counsel of the NSA, said the government "obviously would
   not be thrilled" by RSA's China venture. China hasn't in
   the past been party to international agreements governing
   encryption exports, he noted, and RSA's move could force
   other countries to consider China as an important player.
   "It's going to create an interesting strain in the
   international discussion," he said.
   Japan, an even more potent force in technology, appears to
   be leaning toward loosening export controls on encryption,
   Mr. Baker and other industry executives say. RSA plans to
   announce the formation of a new company in Japan today, but
   the venture will be subject to U.S. export controls, Mr.
   Bidzos said.
   Encryption uses special mathematical formulas, called
   algorithms, to scramble voice conversations or data to make
   them unintelligible to eavesdroppers. RSA's founders
   developed a popular variant of the technology that helps
   determine the authenticity of senders and recipients of
   messages. Both privacy and authentication are widely
   regarded as crucial to advances in electronic commerce.
   RSA struck its deal with departments of China's Ministry of
   Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, and the Academy of
   Sciences. They will use two RSA software products -- one
   for authentication and one for protecting the contents of
   PC hard drives -- internally and help distribute them. The
   Academy scientists who will develop new encryption software
   also will be paid to try to break RSA's products to test
   their strength, Mr. Bidzos said.
   A spokesman at the Commerce Department's bureau of export
   administration said he was unaware of RSA's China venture,
   but said the agency would be monitoring developments.
   Mr. Baker, the former NSA attorney, questioned whether
   customers in other countries would warm to the idea of
   Chinese-developed encryption software. Products approved by
   the U.S. government for export have the stigma that NSA can
   decode, and Chinese products might be subject to even more
   suspicion, Mr. Baker said.
   Still, the RSA deal is likely to be seen as further
   evidence of slipping U.S. control over encryption. "It is
   another example of what happens when you try to impose
   unilateral controls on what is in reality uncontrollable
   technology," said Bruce Heiman, an outside attorney for the
   Business Software Alliance.

The New York Times, February 10, 1996
   The Idiot Chip
   By Frank Rich [Columnist]
   In the annals of dumb solutions to serious problems,
   history will have a ball with the V-chip, the antidote to
   trash TV that became the law of the land on Thursday when
   Bill Clinton signed the telecommunications bill. Far from
   making television safer for children, the V-chip will
   merely postpone and confuse the issue until well into the
   next century -- even as it provides politicians with
   convenient cover.
   By embracing the V-chip, Democrats and Republicans alike
   can posture as if they care about children without actually
   having to do anything to improve their cultural lot.
   Let Mr. V-chip do the job instead!
   The V-chip is a gimmick that has as much to do with
   ameliorating TV for kids as the Forbes flat tax has to do
   with serious tax reform.
   To see why, it's essential to realize that a cultural
   revolution took place in America this week.
   Contrary to the headlines and sound bites, the new
   telecommunications law is not just about cable rates and
   phone service, the explosion of new technologies and the
   unconstitutional effort to stamp out "indecency" and
   abortion information on the Internet.
   If you look at the bigger picture, this law is also about
   a mammoth expansion of mass culture -- more media, more
   outlets -- and a rapid expansion of power for the handful
   of mega-corporations that control it all, from TV, movies,
   music and publishing to both print and electronic news. It
   was perfectly symbolic that on the day Mr. Clinton signed
   the bill, Disney got its official Federal approval to
   swallow up ABC.
   Into this vast new universe of omnipotent media goliaths
   comes the tiny V-chip, designed to help parents block the
   coarse outpourings of an exploding digital universe.
   Common sense alone dooms this gizmo to failure.
   Who can rate some 600,000 hours of programming broadcast
   per year by even our current 70-channel cable systems?
   (Hollywood only has to rate roughly 550 movies -- 1,000
   hours -- per year.) Should crime-sated local news be
   blocked? "MASH" reruns? Reports from a future gulf war?
   "E.R."? Pro football? "Schindler's List"? (If so, a network
   may be tempted to duck a V-chip block -- which would lower
   ratings and revenue -- by sanitizing the Holocaust.)
   Even if all the practical, political and legal questions
   raised by the V-chip could be miraculously resolved
   overnight, it is still pie-in-the-sky. The chips are only
   required on new TV sets, so it will be years before most
   households, especially multi-set households, will be in the
   V-chip's harness.
   Even then, parents with kids in different age groups will
   have to choose between their younger and older children as
   they decide whether to flick the switch each night. Weaker
   parents will take the same path of least resistance they do
   now.
   As the founder of Action for Children's Television, Peggy
   Charren has been fighting for kids decades longer than most
   politicians.
   She is not only skeptical that the V-chip will transform
   lax parents into concerned ones, but points out that the
   chip doesn't even address the Saturday morning blight of
   brainwashing commercials ("worse than the programming") for
   violent toys and junk food.
   Nor, Ms. Charren adds, is there any language in the
   telecommunications law to require networks to increase the
   quantity and quality of good children's TV that might offer
   an after-school alternative to "Jenny Jones."
   Mr. Clinton will press for better programming when he meets
   with Hollywood potentates -- some of whom are his campaign
   contributors -- at the White House on Feb. 29. A far
   tougher idea -- one adopted by the British Government last
   month -- is being promoted by the Media Access Project, a
   public-interest organization.
   It argues that the one gift the networks still want from
   Congress and didn't get in the telecommunications law --
   more space on the public airwaves (so-called "spectrum")
   for additional channels -- be given only if they agree to
   cede some of it to public-service broadcasting, including
   top-notch children's TV.
   But the greedy media goliaths will fight any such proposal
   as vehemently as they oppose the V-chip.
   The politicians, hiding behind the V-chip, will let them
   get away with it.
   Delinquent parents, told that their children will soon be
   in the hands of an electronic nanny, will have a new excuse
   for doing nothing.
   And like each TV generation before it, today's children
   will grow up to fight this battle for their children on yet
   another day.

   Internet Users Say They'd Rather Not Share Their 'Cookies'
   By Joan E. Rigdon
   Netscape Communications Corp., responding to complaints
   from consumers, said it will change its Internet browser
   software so customers can prevent on-line merchants from
   tracking their footsteps in cyberspace.
   The ruckus began Monday, when the Financial Times reported
   on a little-known feature in Netscape software called
   Cookies. Cookies helps merchants on the Internet's
   multimedia World Wide Web track what customers do in their
   stores, and how long they spend doing it.
   Cookies stores this data on the customer's own hard drive,
   (in a text file called "Cookies.txt" in the Netscape
   directory) . The next time the customer visits the
   merchant's store, the merchant can read about the
   customer's last visit, and serve up a version of the store
   that's tailored for the customer.
   Cookies won't show merchants what other stores the customer
   has visited.
   Net surfers have complained on-line about the feature,
   saying it's an invasion of privacy and that it ties up the
   resources of their own computers.
   Netscape, the Mountain View, Calif., maker of the No. 1
   Internet browsing software, says it didn't think people
   might object to Cookies, since merchants can track a
   customer's footsteps even without Cookies, and few have
   complained about that. Product manager Jeff Treuhaft
   contends Cookies actually helps customers, because among
   other things, it allows customers to buy several things
   from different parts, or "pages," of an Internet store, and
   only pay once, instead of once at every page.
   Also, the Internet's standards board, called the Internet
   Engineering Task Force, has asked Netscape to propose
   Cookies as a standard for the Internet, Netscape said.
   Still, Netscape agreed to change the software. In future
   versions of Netscape, customers will have the choice of
   refusing to let a merchant lay down "a persistent Cookie,"
   Mr. Treuhaft says, referring to Cookies that track customer
   movements for days, weeks or months, instead of just a
   single Internet session, as most do. "We want to give the
   user as much control as possible," Mr. Treuhaft says.

   China Tells Internet Users To Register With Police
   Beijing (AP) - China ordered all users of the Internet and

   police, as part of an effort to tighten control over
   information.
   The order came in a circular issued by the Ministry of
   Public Security, according to the state-run Xinhua News

   Xinhua didn't give a date by which current users must
   register but said new users and those switching or
   terminating services must inform police within 30 days. It
   was unclear how foreigners would be affected.
   The rules haven't been published in detail, but previous
   Xinhua reports warned network users not to harm national
   security, reveal state secrets or disseminate pornography.
   China embarked on a broad crackdown on Internet users and
   other sources of information potentially harmful to
   government interests in December.
   The Ministry of Post Telecommunications was made the sole
   provider of channels connecting Chinese computer users with

   Financial Times, 15 February, 1996
   Cyberlaws [Editorial]
   Communication *sans frontieres*. To the Internet's fans
   that is the essence of its appeal. But to anyone putting
   information on the Internet's World Wide Web, its global
   nature is the cause of a growing headache: how to uphold
   intellectual property rights to the rivers of information
   pouring over its wires.
   Online computer systems such as the Net are among the
   fastest growing ways to distribute information -- music and
   pictures as well as words and numbers. But existing
   copyright laws deal inadequately with digital transmission.
   Regulation is complicated by the way that information
   downloaded in one country can have originated almost
   anywhere in the world. The $35bn-a-year music industry now
   believes that digital copyright abuse is a big future
   threat to its revenues.
   The century-old Berne convention on copyright and the
   General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade represent a degree
   of international agreement on the treatment of such issues.
   However, many countries are not signatories, while
   standards of intellectual property protection vary widely
   among those which have signed.
   Moreover, there are technological problems in enforcing
   agreements even where they exist. At present, it is often
   difficult to identify both those who have accessed
   information, and those who have entered it on the Net.
   Given that problem, some groups want companies providing
   Internet access to be responsible for upholding rules,
   rather than users or publishers. But this is highly
   unattractive: service providers will be unaware of much on
   the Net.
   The currently imperfect state of protection is one reason
   why much cyberinformation is junk, of value to almost
   nobody, deposited partly to stir up interest in paidfor
   services beyond the Net. However, new ways to restrict
   access to parts of the Net, and to charge for subscriptions
   to that information, may address that shortcoming.
   Companies are also working on "electronic tags" which will
   show whether information is passed to unauthorised users.
   If such technological developments bear fruit, the whole
   game may change. The mainstay of the Internet may no longer
   be information already published in another medium.
   Instead, publishers could put material of real value on the
   Net, knowing they would be paid. Other media may be
   squeezed as the Internet assumes some of their role.
   In this respect, copyright problems are a symptom of the
   Internet's immaturity, rather than a sign that electronic
   sophistication has made regulation impossible. The Net
   itself is a creation of technology, not policy, and the
   solutions to this problem are more likely to be
   technological than legal. But solutions must be found if
   the Net is to realise its enormous commercial potential.

The 2-15-96 NYT reports on the design and manufacture of
   the new high-tech Swiss bank note:
      The 50-franc bill is the world's first digital bank note
      -- designed on a computer that resolves its design into
      2.5 billion points, each of them individually accessible
      electronically. There are more than 20 security
      features, though the precise number is a secret. Its
      design is vertical rather than horizontal. Ten printing
      processes are involved, including silk screening for the
      chameleon numbers and hot stamping for the silvery
      elements.
      The Swiss say American bills are "a little outdated,
      even the new ones, as far as the state of the art goes."

Computerworld, February 12, 1996, Front page:
   Stealth E-mail poses corporate security risk
   By Gary H. Anthes
   Anonymous remailers on the Internet are emerging as a
   threat to national and corporate security, some experts
   warn.
   These remailers are Internet sites that strip the names and
   addresses from electronic-mail messages before passing them
   along anonymously to prople or newsgroups.
   For corporate information systems managers, stealth E-mail
   is especially troubling because it allows hackers to attack
   systems, steal trade secrets and broadcast them worldwide
   without leaving an audit trail for authorities to follow.
   "Anonymous remailers have a lot of nasty potential," said
   Stephen T. Kent, chief scientist for security technology at
   BBN Corp. in Cambridge, Mass. "They have the broadcast
   potential of the news media but without the possibility of
   recourse if something is unsubstantiated or defaming is
   published."
   Critics are calling for strict limits or an outright ban on
   remailer sites, but others insist they are a safeguard
   against electronic snooping by abusive governments and
   should be considered a political freedom.
   Anonymous remailers have been used in a variety of criminal
   acts, including distributing pornography and computer
   viruses, violating copyright laws and harassing people with
   nasty messages.
   One snowy day last month, for example, about 25% of the
   workforce at a defense contractor in Rockville, Md., went
   home after they received a bogus E-mail message dismissing
   them for the day. The message originated from an anonymous
   remailer that allowed the user to impersonate a senior
   company official.
   But there are more scary, less publicized uses of
   remailers, said Paul Strassmann, former director of defense
   information at the Pentagon. Stealth E-mail also is used
   extensively by Russian criminals, often former KGB agents.
   "This method of communication is a favorite for engaging
   the services of cyber-criminals and for authorizing payment
   for their acts through a third party." Strassmann said.
   Its Reputation Precedes It
   Perhaps the best-known remailer site is in Finland at
   anon.penet.fi.
   The Finnish server was used last year to publish
   confidential and copyrighted scriptures from the Church of
   Scientology. It also was used to reveal the secret source
   code used by RSA Data Security, Inc. in some of its
   encryption products.
   Last year, police raided the Finnish site and seized
   records and computer gear as part of an investigation of
   alleged copyright infringement.
   The administrator of anon.penet.fi offers this warning to
   new users: "I believe very firmly that it's not for me to
   dictate how other people ought to behave. But remember,
   anonymous postings are a privilege, and use them
   accordingly. Remember, this is a service that some people    who use newsgroups such as alt.sexual.abuse.recovery need.
   Please don't do anything stupid that would force me to
   close down the service."
   One remailer advertises itself as a way to thwart attempts
   by intelligence agencies to trace illegal traffic,
   Strassmann said. It holds all incoming messages until five
   minutes after the hour, then remails them in random order.
   The messages are sent through five to 20 other remailers,
   with a stop in at least one of the several countries noted
   for lax law enforcement, he said.
   Yet other experts say the threat from remailers is greatly
   exaggerated. "We've had remailers around for a while, and
   society hasn't fallen," said Mike Godwin, staff counsel at
   the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco. "We've
   had anonymous communication in the U.S. for years, you can
   use a public telephone, send a letter without a return
   address or engage in a cash transaction."
   Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down an Ohio law
   that required the authors of political posters and
   pamphlets to identify themselves. "In the case of political
   speach, you can't make people tell you who they are," said
   Patrick Sullivan, executive director of the Computer Ethics
   Institute in Washington.
   But Sullivan said the police raid on the Finnish remailer
   was prompted by the Church of Scientology's legitimate
   complaint about violations of copyright law.
   "I haven't heard many uses of remailers that haven't
   involved, at the very least, being disrespective and, at
   the most, trying to cause harm of some sort." he said.
   _________________________________________________________
   Battle against remailers an unfair fight
   Think of anonymous remailers as enemies you can't fight
   face to face, says Paul Strassmann, former director of
   defense information at the Pentagon and now a lecturer at
   the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.
   "Anonymous remailers are here to stay," he said. "That
   means the old military paradigm of retaliation falls apart.
   The whole theory of warfare has been if someone attacks
   you, you can attack them. But when you are anonymous, there
   is no one to shoot at."
   Strassmann said society myst look for defenses in the
   health sciences, not among electronic technologies.
   "The history of public health teaches us that suppression
   of any disease must be preceded by a thorough understanding
   of its behavior, its method of transmission and how it
   creates its own ecology," he said.
   "As in the case of smallpox, yellow fever, flu epidemics,
   AIDS or malaria, it will take disasters before the public
   may accept that some forms of restrictions on the
   electronic freedom of speech and  that  privacy may be
   worthwhile."

You shoot electro-ammunition straight, so your credibility is solid. HQ should take target practice from you. Although explanations on this list may not be comprehensible to the public, or to NSCP's PR Dept.
What are the chances that NSCP might add a feature that would allow customers to say yes or no at login to tracking their movements at any site visited, with a friendly notice that tracking analysis was being done?
That might redeem the exchange value of cookies, and perhaps come closer to gving customers equality with the merchants, and merchants credibility with customers. As you are giving Netscape here, despite Wall Street's treachery.

   The teleportation site hiply introduces the topic with    its science fiction ancestry.  The site even has a link to

To supplement TIS's Web site information on CKE, here's a
   mailing from Steve Walker earlier this month:
   TRUSTED INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INC.
   February 2, 1996
   There has been amazing progress on TIS's Commercial Key
   Escrow (CKE) initiative since my last status report.
   In November, we submitted a Commodity Jurisdiction (CJ)
   request to the U.S. Department of State for our Gauntlet
   Internet Firewall Product with CKE-based IP Encryption,
   which constitutes our Global Virtual Private Network (GVPN)
   system (see figure 1). Our Gauntlet system has had a
   Virtual Private Network (VPN) capability using the Data
   Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm to encrypt
   firewall-to-firewall communications for the past year. But
   because of U.S. export controls, we have not been able to
   sell this option outside of the U.S. and Canada. By adding
   CKE technology to our firewalls, the Gauntlet system with
   DES and CKE now meets the U.S. government requirements for
   export to most parts of the world.
   In the course of several meetings with U.S. government
   representatives. we were told that it will take a while
   longer for all the details of the CJ process to be worked
   out, but that the U.S. government was willing to consider
   a temporary (up to 4-year) export license until the CJ
   process is in place. In early December, we submitted such
   a request and on January 19, 1996, it was approved (see
   figure 2).
   While this temporary export license has limitations (there
   must be a Data Recovey Center in the U.S. as well as in the
   foreign country because reciprocal agreements do not yet
   exist between the U.S. and foreign governments), it
   represents the first export approval of a DES-based key
   escrow encryption system, a small step but a giant leap
   toward full exportability of good cryptography when
   equipped with user-controlled key recovery. We are now
   discussing Global Virtual Private Networks, based on our
   Gauntlet-CKE system, with several multinational companies.
   In December, I attended a special meeting of the
   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
   (OECD) in Paris to discuss the international ramifications
   of the U.S. key escrow initiative. The consensus of the
   meeting was that user-controlled key escrow provides the
   only workable solution to the long-standing dilemma between
   the private sector's need for encryption protection and
   governments' needs to be able to decrypt the communications
   of criminals, terrorists, and other adversaries. Other
   meetings will follow, but it appears that most major
   governments endorse the U.S. government's user-controlled
   key escrow initiative as the only practical way through the
   cryptography maze.
   In mid-January, Microsoft announced its long-awaited
   Cryptographic Application Programming Interface (CAPI).
   This development promises to finally provide a well-defined
   separation between applications calling on cryptography and
   the actual performance of the cryptography. Now users will
   be able to request cryptographic functions in hundreds of
   applications and select precisely which cryptography to use
   at the time of program execution rather than program
   purchase. Cryptographic Service Providers (CSPs) can now
   evolve independent of applications, and users can choose
   whatever cryptography is available wherever they are in the
   world. TIS is working closely with CSP vendors to ensure
   that CSPs with good cryptography are available in domestic
   and exportable versions as soon as possible based on the
   U.S. government's key escrow initiative.
   In a presentation at the recent RSA Conference, I tried to
   put all this in perspective by conducting a "thought
   experiment" (see attachment 3).
   +  Suppose the U.S. government had never thought of placing
      export controls on cryptography...
      We would now have widespread use of encryption, both
      domestically and worldwide; we would be in a state of
      "Utopia," with widespread availability of cryptography
      with unlimited key lengths. But, once in this state, we
      will face situations where we need a file that had been
      encrypted by an associate who is unavailable (illness,
      traffic jam, or change of jobs). We will then realize
      that we must have some systematic way to recover our
      encrypted information when the keys are unavailable.
      When we add a user-controlled key recovery capability to
      our Utopia, we find ourselves in an "Ultimate Utopia,"
      with unlimited key length cryptography, widely available
      through mass market applications, and user-controlled
      key recovery.
   +  But, unfortunately, the U.S. government *did* think of
      cryptographic export controls. And over the past several
      years, we have been frustrated by repeated unsuccessful
      attempts to resolve this dilemma...
      In 1992, the U.S. government allowed the export of
      40-bit keys, a solution so weak no one wanted it.
      In 1993, the U.S. government announced Clipper, an
      attempt to give users good cryptography while preserving
      the U.S. government's prerogatives. But almost everyone
      hated U.S. Government-controlled key escrow, including
      most foreign governments.
      In 1994, industry rebelled with the proposed Cantwell
      legislative initiative to remove cryptography from U.S.
      State Department control. And, behind the scenes, the
      U.S. government orchestrated a massive counterattack.
      The result: a study that acknowledged the widespread
      availability of foreign cryptography yet proposed no
      change in U.S. government policies on cryptographic
      exports.
   +  Then in 1995, the U.S. government announced its key
      escrow initiative: allow the export of up to 64-bit
      cryptography (a remarkable concession) when accompanied
      by an acceptable form of user-controlled key escrow
      (critical component to this policy being that "an
      acceptable escrow system" must have sufficient integrity
      to give the government confidence that, with a warrant,
      the keys will be available.)...
      Some in the computer industry labeled this just another
      form of Clipper and vowed to continue the fight against
      U.S. government regulation of encryption in any form --       presumably forever. On the other hand, once the new
      escrowed encryption policy was announced, U.S.
      government agencies -- the FBI, NSA, White House, DoD,
      DoJ, NIST, and NSC -- closed ranks behind it and have
      shown little interest in discussing any other
      approaches. In addition, neither political party has
      shown any interest in taking up the argument in the
      Congress, probably because it is a complex issue and
      there is no obvious "winning" position. But, depending
      upon how the definition of user-controlled key escrow is
      resolved, the new escrow policy could just be the
      long-sought compromise between government and industry
      that gets us through this morass.
   +  If we can ensure that organizations can control the
      security of backup access to their encrypted information
      through well-designed commercial key recovery systems --
      yet also ensure that governments have access when
      justified via normal legal procedures -- we may have
      truly found the "Ultimate Utopia" solution to a dilemma
      that has existed all of our professional lives and
      threatens to continue through the next generation...
   Thus, in my thought experiment I have come to the
   conclusion that we (industry and government) are all
   heading towards the same objective, but on a different path
   from what some of us originally wanted. Yet, to my way of
   thinking, that path has to accomodate us all if we are ever
   to arrive at any mutually agreeable destination. When one
   group of participants raises insurmountable barriers for
   another group, it simply blocks everyone from progressing
   down any path, and the net result is that U.S. industry is
   not able to export any good crypto-based security.
   We at TIS are dedicated to finding a solution acceptable to
   all sides. We ask your help in this struggle. If you want
   exportable cryptography routinely available in your
   lifetime and believe that user-controlled key recovery is
   an important, if not vital, capability, please contact us
   at . If you want to integrate exportable CKE
   into your product line, we are ready to help. If you want
   to buy internationally deployable good cryptography with
   your favorite applications, tell your application vendor
   you want escrow-enabled applications.
   We all have an opportunity to make a major difference here.
   The opportunity is ours to take or forgo. Help us make this
   happen. Visit our www site, at  and

   Netscape Will Issue Fix for Flaw Found In Browser System
   Mountain View, Calif. - Netscape Communications Corp.
   confirmed that Princeton University researchers found a
   potential security flaw in Netscape's popular Internet
   browser technology, but said the flaw was minor and that
   the company will issue a software fix for it next week.
   Edward Felten, an assistant professor of computer science
   at Princeton, posted a report on the Internet earlier this
   week describing the flaw in Netscape's Navigator 2.0, a
   product that enables the use of programs created with Java,
   Sun Microsystems Inc.'s hot programming language for the
   Internet. Java can be used to create "applets," small
   applications such as spreadsheets, that can be downloaded
   from the Internet's World Wide Web.
   Both Netscape's Navigator and Sun's Java have defenses
   designed to prevent Java applets from connecting with any
   computers except the ones they are summoned to by users and
   the ones they came from. But the Princeton team found a way
   to defeat those defenses, meaning that applets could
   theoretically be manuevered into other computers on a
   network. Applets aren't viruses, but in theory, they could
   be used to peruse confidential documents or other
   information.
   In trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Netscape fell $1.875
   to $62, while Sun Microsystems jumped 7.8% to $51.875, up
   $3.75.
   Netscape product manager Jeff Treuhaft said exploiting the
   flaw would require extremely skilled hacking and many other
   unlikely advantages, such as intimate familiarity with the
   network being hacked.
   Marianne Mueller, a top Java security engineer, also said
   the chances of such hacking occurring are "remote," but
   said Sun also soon will issue a software fix that will plug
   the possible security leak.

   never-give-up, FBI tracking and NSA cracking.

   Scrambling for a Policy on Encryption Exports
   [Long snip]
   Industry also is fanning Congress's interest in taking a
   bigger role in the encryption debate. "Without
   congressional interest, the administration has no reason to
   liberalize exports at all," said Becca Gould, director of
   policy at the Business Software Alliance. "This issue is in
   Congress's front yard because it affects the economy" as
   well as U.S. citizens' privacy rights.
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. Robert W. Goodlatte
   (R-Va.) agree. They plan to introduce bills in the Senate
   and House aimed at loosening the restrictions on
   encryption. "The federal government is taking an attitude
   that's based more in the 1970s than in present time," said
   Leahy in a telephone interview.
   "This is a matter that should be decided by legislation,"
   he added. "We're talking about billions of dollars in
   revenues and thousands of jobs if we're handicapped in our
   global market, especiaUy if what we're told to do is to
   build an export encryption program that is so outdated that
   our 12-year-old computer experts wouJd laugh at it."
   The bills would do away with export licenses for any
   encryption technology considered to be "generally
   available," or "in the public domain." Leahy said that
   although he, too, worries about national security and
   terrorism, trying to bottle up technology won't solve the
   problem.
   Law enforcement has "got to figure out how to keep ahead
   ... and surprise, surprise, there will be some times when
   we won't be able to eavesdrop," Leahy said. Even now,
   criminals can make calls at pay telephones or avoid
   detection in other ways. The government shouldn't cripple
   the computer industry every time a new technology springs
   up that challenges law enforcement, he said.
   "What I'm suggesting is that if [the administration] works
   with the Congress, we'll find a solution," Leahy said.

   Scrambling for a Policy on Encryption Exports
      As Technology Advances, U.S. and Industry Seek
      Compromise That Balances Public, Private Fears
   By Elizabeth Corcoran
   Keeping information about technology out of other people's
   hands gets tougher all the time. And in the realm of the
   Internet, where information ignores boundaries and some
   cybersurfers flaunt rules, it may become impossible.
   A big test of that statement is emerging in cryptography,
   the business of scrambling information so that it looks
   like gibberish to anyone lacking the keys for unlocking the
   code.
   Once considered an arcane subspecialty of mathematicians
   and espionage, cryptography is rapidly becoming big
   business as more and more of the world's information is
   exchanged on electronic networks and as more and more
   people want to protect their data from prying eyes.
   But in these times of international terrorism, drug
   trafficking and sometimes peculiar financial transactions,
   law enforcement agencies want to be able to legally
   eavesdrop. As technology has grown dramatically more
   powerful, the ability to peek at encrypted information is
   slipping from the hands of government.
   That balance -- how much access can government demand vs.
   how much privacy others want -- has long been a theological
   debate between civil liberties advocates and worried law
   enforcement officials.
   Now, giddy with the growth of the Internet, technology
   companies have joined the debate. Both the software
   industry and civil liberties advocates believe powerful
   encryption will spur the growth of electronic
   communications and the Internet. And they don't want
   encryption restrictions to curb that growth.
   There are no limits on what kinds of encryption people can
   use within the United States. But the government has used
   export restrictions to try to shape what encryption
   technology is used internationally, and by extension, what
   is available in the United States. Those export laws
   prohibit U.S. companies from selling their best technology
   overseas.
   The restrictions, companies contend slow the development of
   the Internet and harm a potentially lucrative market for
   U.S. manufacturing. Making two flavors of an encryption
   product, U.S. companies contend, is expensive. Yet even
   more worrisome is that foreign competitors are likely to
   move in and offer better technology. That could spell the
   loss not just of sales of encryption technology, but of
   many other products that rely on strong digital protection
   as well.
   So companies are looking hard for ways to wriggle around
   the rules -- and beginning to find them.
   "Trying to suppress this technobgy is like Prohibition,"
   said Whitfield Diffie, a cryptographer at Sun Microsystems
   Inc. and an outspoken advocate of widespread use of
   encryption technology. Companies will use anything at hand
   -- technology, business strategies and even the promise of
   congressional action -- to begin to get their home-brews
   out.
   Building and breaking encryption is hard. All information
   stored in computers -- whether pictures or sounds or
   documents -- is represented by ones or zeros or bits, the
   genetic code of the digital world. Encryption techniques
   amount to applying clever mathematical formulas to a
   collection of bits to make it look like gibberish to the
   uninitiated.
   Unlocking encrypted data requires a "key," a mathematical
   formula that can make sense of the tricks used to scramble
   the data. One common way to measure the sophisticaticn of
   an encryption scheme is by the number of bits in the key.
   The more bits, the harder it is to decode the information.
   A 30-bit key, for instance, could take as many as a billion
   random calculations to crack the code. A 60-bit key could
   take a billion-times-a-billion calculations.
   In past decades, governments were largely the only
   organizations with the money and need to tackle such
   expensive problems. But as the power of computers has
   soared -- and the cost of running millions of calculations
   has fallen -- companies and individuals have begun to
   clamor for sophisticated encryption.
   "We believe that encryption is a critical technology" to
   support many areas of electronic commerce, said Craig
   Mundie, a senior vice president at Microsoft Corp.
   Under current rules, U.S. companies can export encryption
   technologies that use up to 40-bit keys. A few years ago,
   such a lock might have stopped all but the most determined
   digital interlopers.
   No more. Within the past year graduate students at the
   Ecole Polytechnique in Paris and others at the
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology have shown they can
   break the 40-bit encryption used by Netscape Communications
   Corp. A few weeks ago, Diffie and six other well-know
   cryptographers began circulating a report in which they
   argue that to "adequately" protect information for the next
   20 years, keys should be as long as 90 bits.
   Even encryption wizards at the National Security Agency
   would have trouble unlocking 90-bit encrypted information,
   experts say.
   So the government has tried to craft a compromise. Last
   summer, the government suggested that it would likely let
   companies use up to 64-bit encryption -- provided they set
   up a way for law enforcement agents, with a court order, to
   unlock encrypted information.
   Under this proposal, a "trusted third party," such as a
   bank or an encryption company that typically handles
   sensitive information, would safeguard the key. The plan
   has since bogged down over such details as precisely who
   might qualify as a trusted third party.
   Last fall, Trusted Information Systems (TIS) in Glenwood,
   Md., in what it calls a test case, applied for a license to
   export a sophisticated (and still unexportable) 56-bit
   encryption system called DES. Steve Walker, who heads TIS,
   has invested months in outlining the sort of spare-key
   program that he believes both the government and his
   customers can stomach. In late January, he got approval to
   ship his product to Britain.
   "It's not perfect; it's not where we want to be," Walker
   insisted. He purposely submitted a case, he said, that was
   virtually certain to meet the government's still evolving
   criteria. "But it's a first, giant baby step," he said.
   Trusting a Third Party?
   Others are uneasy with putting the means to unlock files in
   the hands of a "trusted third party."
   "Ask anyone who owns a business: Are they willing to give
   copies of a spare key that leads to everything sensitive in
   their company to a third party," said Jim Bidzos, chief
   executive of RSA Data Security Inc., a leading encryption
   firm.
   But government officials get nervous if the only keys to
   the scrambled material are held by its owners. Ed Roback,
   an encryption policy specialist at the National Institute
   of Standards and Technology, puts it this way: "I know of
   few front doors that can't be broken down. It's a little
   different with encryption," when it literally might take
   10,000 years to break the code without the key.
   Roback and law enforcement officials say they'd be
   delighted to see Americans make more use of encryption,
   particularly if spare keys were held by a third party.
   "This nation, more than any other, relies on computers ...
   [so] there's a lot of vulnerability and encryption can help
   that," Roback said. "So it's a good thing -- but it can
   present a problem for national law enforcement."
   But momentum in the United States could swing toward
   widespread use of sophisticated encryption -- without spare
   keys -- if such technology was widely available. That's
   just what a recent announcement from Microsoft could help
   spur.
   In January, Microsoft told developers it had created a
   module in its operating system software that will let
   applications such as word processing programs or
   spreadsheets "plug in" to encryption technology.
   An application developer who built a software program for
   filing expense accounts would not have to add encryption to
   his product. Instead, the developer would need only to
   write a small program that taps the encryption technology
   available through the operating system.
   The strength of the encryption program could vary.
   Microsoft plans to include a 40-bit code with the version
   of Windows used principaUy by companies (called Windows
   NT). That encryption technology would be easy to export.
   But Microsoft also is encouraging other encryption firms,
   including RSA and TSI, to build more sophisticated
   encryption modules that could be used in the United States.
   Commercial products that take advantage of the new function
   are not likely to appear until the end of the year. But
   Microsoft is hoping it will spur more widespread use of
   encryption. "The single most pressing problem for
   electronic commerce is to create a secure payment
   structure," Mundie said -- and Microsoft is hoping to
   accelerate that work.
   RSA's Bidzos is among those in industry who would love to
   see the government give up on trying to control encryption
   technology. He worries that other countries are gearing up
   to snatch a big role in selling encryption while his
   company and other U.S. businesses remain entangled in U.S.
   policies.
   So he's testing the rules. Early this month, RSA announced
   that it had created subsidiaries in the People's Republic
   of China and in Japan. In China, RSA partners include the
   Chinese government. Bidzos plans to do joint research on
   encryption software with scientists there.
   Although Bidzos says he is planning to export only the
   approved, 40-bit encryption technology to his Chinese
   colleagues, "one genuine concern is that they might try to
   strengthen it themselves," he said. "It would be hard to do
   -- but not impossible. I've never had a conversation with
   [the Chinese] about it," Bidzos added.
   In addition, the Chinese have some interesting ideas of
   their own about new areas of cryptography, Bidzos said.
   "They're pretty advanced." And if the group developed more
   powerful techniques than even RSA has in the United States?
   Bidzos shrugged. RSA would likely take any promising ideas
   and develop them into products in the United States. As for
   Chinese export restrictions, "I haven't thought about it,"
   he said.
   Going Up to the Hill
   Industry also is fanning Congress's interest in taking a
   bigger role in the encryption debate. "Without
   congressional interest, the administration has no reason to
   liberalize exports at all," said Becca Gould, director of
   policy at the Business Software Alliance. "This issue is in
   Congress's front yard because it affects the economy" as
   well as U.S. citizens' privacy rights.
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. Robert W. Goodlatte
   (R-Va.) agree. They plan to introduce bills in the Senate
   and House aimed at loosening the restrictions on
   encryption. "The federal government is taking an attitude
   that's based more in the 1970s than in present time," said
   Leahy in a telephone interview.
   "This is a matter that should be decided by legislation,"
   he added. "We're talking about billions of dollars in
   revenues and thousands of jobs if we're handicapped in our
   global market, especially if what we're told to do is to
   build an export encryption program that is so outdated that
   our 12-year-old computer experts would laugh at it."
   The bills would do away with export licenses for any
   encryption technology considered to be "generally
   available," or "in the public domain." Leahy said that
   although he, too, worries about national security and
   terrorism, trying to bottle up technology won't solve the
   problem.
   Law enforcement has "got to figure out how to keep ahead
   ... and surprise, surprise, there will be some times when
   we won't be able to eavesdrop," Leahy said. Even now,
   criminals can make calls at pay telephones or avoid
   detection in other ways. The government shouldn't cripple
   the computer industry every time a new technology springs
   up that challenges law enforcement, he said.
   "What I'm suggesting is that if [the administration] works
   with the Congress, we'll find a solution," Leahy said.
   "We say over and over that we recognize that this is a very
   difficult issue," Roback said. But, he added, "the
   government has thought about [encryption policies] for a
   long time as well as industry," he said. To reach some
   resolution, he added, "compromise is going to be necessary
   on all fronts."

Wall Street Journal, February 26, 1996, p. B4.
   New Proposals On Encryption Get Tepid Response
   By Jared Sandberg
   Two bills are expected to be introduced in Congress that
   try to resolve the deadlock between the administration and
   the Internet industry on software encryption, but industry
   executives are lukewarm to the new proposals.
   The two proposals, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Patrick J.
   Leahy of Vermont and GOP Rep. Robert W. Goodlatte of
   Virginia, seek to loosen government restrictions on
   encryption -- mathematical formulas that are used to
   scramble data beyond recognition of eavesdroppers. The
   government prevents the export of strong encryption because
   it hampers its efforts to monitor the actions of terrorists
   and foreign governments. The Clinton administration wants
   to set up government-approved repositories that keep copies
   of mathematical keys for decoding encrypted information, so
   law enforcement officials can decode private communications
   if granted a court order.
   Those policies have met with uniform distaste on the part
   of the industry executives, who say that widespread use of
   strong encryption is essential to the success of electronic
   commerce over the Internet. They argue that the
   administration's export restrictions on strong
   cryptography, determined by the length of the key needed to
   unlock the code, are hurting business abroad where
   competitors can freely offer stronger encryption software.
   Producing a separate weaker version of encryption software
   for foreign markets not only raises costs but is becoming
   pointless because hackers can now access computers powerful
   enough to break the weaker code.
   "The federal government's ideas on encryption are based on
   a situation which may have existed 10 or 20 years ago with
   very little realization of the realities of today," said
   Sen. Leahy. "We're not going to sell our computer programs
   if we have outdated computer technology, especialiy if
   people can buy it in Europe or Asia."
   The two new bills would allow for the export of much
   stronger encryption provided that level of security was
   "generally available." Sen. Leahy's proposal states that
   the key-escrow scheme will be voluntary, and establishes
   rules by which companies rather than government agencies
   would hold the keys for decoding data. These companies
   would be liable for abuse of keys and subject to strict
   procedures for releasing the keys to law enforcement.       Though industry executives welcome the bills, they say the
   measures don't go far enough to unshackle high-tech
   companies. Thomas Parenty, product manager at the database
   firm Sybase Inc., said that both bills represent "a good
   start." But by allowing U.S. companies to export encryption
   only as strong as that which is available overseas, Mr.
   Parenty said, the bills won't allow them to innovate and
   produce superior products.
   And putting keys in the hands of third-party companies,
   they say, is still likely to meet industry opposition.
   People familiar with the bills said one motivation is to
   build support for a private version of the key-escrow
   concept, which could be an opportunity for several
   companies who are selling products based on the idea. "It
   would establish the legal framework for their
   implementation to go forward," said James Bidzos, chief
   executive officer of RSA Data Security Inc., an
   encryption-software company in Redwood City, Calif.

The New York Times, January 2, 1996, p. A15.
   Unmuzzling the Internet [OpEd]
      How to evade the censors and make a statement, too.
   By Jaron Lanier (Visiting scholar at the Columbia
   University department of computer science.)
   If President Clinton signs the telecommunications bill
   drastically restricting private as well as public speech on
   the Internet, he can expect a rollicking cat-and-mouse
   game.
   It can be comical when politicians try to control something
   they do not understand. Such is the case with the bill's
   censorship provision, which not only outlaws the
   transmission of material over the Internet that would be
   allowed in most newspapers, but also makes owners of
   computers on a network liable for the speech of others. (As
   Compuserve demonstrated last week when, to satisfy a German
   court, it blocked American subscribers' access to sexually
   explicit material, regulation of the Internet can threaten
   both commercial and constitutional freedoms.)
   The other day, I came up with a way to easily evade the
   proposed American restrictions. My simple idea would be to
   create a computer program, dubbed "Unmuzzle," which would
   deposit incomprehensible fragments of any forbidden
   material in different foreign computers (though maybe not
   Germany's). The contraband communication would only be
   reassembled into a coherent whole when downloaded in the
   home of the user back in the United States, where it would
   become protected speech, as in any other medium.
   I had no intention of actually building "Unmuzzle," but I
   mentioned the notion in E-mail to a friend, and within days
   I was hearing from people I didn't know who were busy
   creating the program with the idea of distributing it
   freely. Fine with me. Such a program would make an mportant
   statement.
   Speaking as someone who has been involved with computers
   for most of my life (I coined the phrase "virtual reality"
   in the early 1980's and created much of the technology for
   it), I find that many Internet users have been reacting to
   attacks on freedom in cyberspace by slumping into a
   separatist, angry mood. They feel that they are being
   denied the rights that others enjoy.
   On the Internet, separatism is expressed by encryption: an
   encrypted message can be read only by the party it is
   intended for. Therefore, in the spirit of the First
   Amendment, I suggest Unmuzzle as an alternative method: it
   may break up images or text into a hundred pieces, but they
   are still accessible to the public.
   The idea of censoring the Internet should be unthinkable,
   especially in the United States. Aside from the question of
   free speech, there's the economic imperative as well. The
   Internet is not a plaything: it is the infrastructure of
   our information technology industry.
   The young have the most to lose from the new restrictions,
   in spite of the fact that such limits are purportedly meant
   to protect them. Schools and libraries will find it
   extremely difficult to offer vital Internet services in the
   face of a mine field of criminal liabilities.
   It is members of Congress and the President who need to
   show some maturity, by rejecting free-speech restrictions
   in the telecommunications bill.

   Special section "Business World Outlook '96."
   In Search Of Computer Security
   By John Markoff
   Computer security is making a transition from the
   university and the research laboratory to the real world.
   So far it is proving to be a rocky evolution.
   Last year, a series of embarrassing gaffes and shortcomings
   undermined the faith of potential computer users in the
   certainty that their data are secure. The flaws have led to
   a growing realization that computer security systems are
   largely untested and that in complex environments like the
   Internet, they do not always respond the way their creators
   had intended.
   Paul C. Kocher, a computer security expert who discovered
   one potential flaw, said, "Many of the security systems
   that I am examining are good enough to keep out casual
   snoopers, but they're failing catastrophically when it
   comes to protecting data against determined attacks."
   The problems are emerging as the computer industry
   increasingly relies upon an arcane mathematical discipline
   that is intended to hide the secrets embedded in digital
   information behind a veil of imposing math problems.
   Cryptography, the science of writing secrets, was for
   centuries largely the province of kings, soldiers and
   spies. But that has changed in the 1990's as the world has
   rushed to use personal computers and computer networks as
   the basis for electronic commerce, communication and
   entertainment.
   Data scrambling has become the key to a vision that it will
   be possible to have private electronic conversations and
   secure financial transactions.
   In principle, data coding protects information by
   scrambling it to keep it out of the reach of everybody but
   those with a supercomputer and tens or even hundreds of
   years to crunch the data.
   But computer researchers have begun discovering flaws,
   sometimes subtle and sometimes glaring, that can help
   criminals take devious shortcuts to obtain the mathematical
   keys used to scramble the data.
   In August, a French computer hacker proved that it was
   possible to use a network of work stations to guickly find
   the secret key created by a coding system developed by the
   Netscape Communications Corporation, the leading developer
   of World Wide Web software.
   The feat cast doubts on the security of a system whose
   security had been scaled back to meet stringent United
   States Government export controls.
   The following month, two computer science graduate students
   at the University of California at Berkeley reported a flaw
   in the Netscape that would permit a technically skilled
   attacker to steal data by circumventing the complex
   calculations needed to break the code.
   In October, a team of Berkeley researchers, including the
   two computer science students, detailed security weaknesses
   in the fundamental software of the Internet that make it
   difficult to protect data that is sent between computers.
   And last month, Mr. Kocher explained a potential flaw in a
   widely used data coding approach known as public-key
   cryptography.
   The flaw could allow eavesdroppers to infer a secret key
   used to protect data in Internet security software,
   electronic payment smart cards and related systems by
   carefully timing how long it takes to compute the secret
   key.
   Mr. Kocher said that while he believed that trusted
   electronic security systems would ultimately emerge, there
   should be no urgency to rush their deployment.
   Banks have spent several hundred years perfecting systems
   for protecting money, he noted, but they have far less
   experience with the new computerized systems designed to
   protect information that represents money.
   One of the pioneers in the mathematics underlying most
   public key systems agrees that prudence is required in
   developing digital commerce.
   "Paul's discovery is one more piece of evidence that
   designing security mechanisms is tricky," said Whitfield
   Diffie, a Sun Microsystems researcher who was one of the
   co-inventors of the original public key technology.
   "Given the trust that we will be placing in systems for
   electronic commerce," he continued, "we should be putting
   all the effort we can into getting them right."

   October 8, 1995
   Jonathan Littman
   38 Miller Avenue Suite 122
   Mill Valley, California 94941
   Dear Jonathan,
   This is in response to your separate letters to us. We
   apologize for not being more prompt, Tsutomu was travelling
   on business and did not receive your September 5 letter
   until recently. As you know we have a contract with
   Hyperion for Tsutomu's account of his participation in the
   arrest of Kevin Mitnick, and at the request of our
   publisher we have decided not to participate in other books
   on the same subject.
   First, in response to your September 7 request to John
   Markoff, for permission to reprint his March 14 Well
   posting, he is not willing to give permission.
   However, we do think it is appropriate to respond to
   several points where you have received inaccurate
   information.
   Our responses are not intended to be a comprehensive answer
   to your list of questions, but only to protect you from
   including libelous material in your book.
   Tsutomu was not asked by any governmental, military or
   intelligence representative to assist in the capture of Mr.
   Mitnick. All of his actions were taken in response to
   requests for assistance from both The Well and Netcom to
   deal with extensive and persistent break-ins.
   Tsutomu's decision to tell John Markoff that he was
   travelling to Raleigh on Sunday morning was done without
   contact with any law enforcement agency. Markoff flew to
   Raleigh independently six hours later after discussing the
   possibility of a story with his editors at the New York
   Times. Markoff did not at any time assist or participate in
   any aspect of the investigation into Kevin Mitnick's
   activities; Markoff was there only as an observer in his
   role as a newspaper reporter.
   Moreover, in Raleigh on Sunday evening the Cellscope
   equipment was never placed in Markoff's car, and there was
   never any discussion about taking it out of the Cellular
   One engineer's van or about placing it in Markoff's car.
   Markoff parked his car near the cell site that night and
   then later drove back to his hotel.
   Tsutomu never told anyone from law enforcement that anyone
   had authorized or cleared Markoff's presence in Raleigh.
   Tsutomu was informed by the Justice Department that his
   actions on behalf of the Internet providers and the
   cellular telephone company during the course of the
   investigation were covered under their fraud detection and
   prevention exception granted to these organizations under
   the ECPA.
   Tsutomu did have discussions with the National Security
   Agency about funding computer security research, the
   results of which were to be placed in the public domain,
   however no research grant was ever made. Tsutomu was not
   aware of any statements made in the search warrant until
   many days after the arrest.
   Tsutomu did not lure Mitnick or anyone else into
   breaking-in to his computers. The attack was entirely
   unprovoked.
   No copies of any files allegedly stolen by Mitnick were
   provided by Tsutomu to anyone other than the legitimate
   owners.
   The first discussion of the possibility of a book on the
   subject of Kevin Mitnick's arrest took place on Thursday
   February 16, when John Markoff received a telephone call
   from John Brockman, a New York City literary agent,
   proposing a collaboration between Markoff and Shimomura.
   You will remember, we hope, that after his July 4, 1994
   article about the hunt for Mitnick, Markoff did not wish to
   pursue the subject of Mitnick's life as a fugitive and
   referred a free-lance article on the subject proposed by
   Playboy to you.
   Also please note that you are inaccurate in stating that
   Tsutomu requested immunity before testifying before
   Congress on April 1993.
   We realize this is a delicate issue for you because of your
   involvement and communication with Kevin Mitnick during the
   period he was a fugitive. However, since your questions
   suggest you believe there may have been something
   inappropriate in Tsutomu's cellular telephone software
   development work, if you do include material in your book
   along this line, journalistic ethics require you to include
   the following: Tsutomu, unlike Mitnick, in all of his
   computer security research over a fifteen year period, has
   always, whenever he has found a vulnerability, made it
   known to the appropriate people, whether CERT, or a private

   Here's Littman on immunity for Shimomura (describing telco
   tracking Mitnick):
   Shimomura's brought along his own hacker's scanning rig.
   It's pretty basic, just an Oki 900 cellular phone and a
   hardware interface to his tiny HP Palmtop. One of
   Shimomura's friends -- who happens to be under federal
   indictment for illegal hacking -- cooked up the interface
   and helped write the software.
   Shimomura likes his computer-controlled cellular phone, but
   its use for tracking is limited. Its main purpose is to
   lock on a call and eavesdrop. It is illegal to use it to
   eavesdrop on calls. That's why Shimomura needed immunity
   from prosecution when he demonstrated his Oki scanner
   before Congress a couple of years ago. (p. 6)

   "High Tech Zaps German Privacy Laws. CompuServe Case Shows
   Difficulty of Enforcement."
      The growing popularity of the Internet and other
      multimedia services poses a major challenge to Germany's
      tough data-protection legislation. The personal       information that is freely given and used for
      marketing purposes in the U.S. is off limits in Germany.
      The CompuServe case demonstrates just how difficult it
      is becoming for national regulators to control the flow
      of information. This is particularly true in Germany,
      where a raft of legislation is in force designed to
      avoid-any repeat of the Nazi-era abuse of data, as well
      as the dissemination of pornography and extremist
      propaganda. The nation's internal security services are
      already struggling to combat the sophisticated use of
      computers by neo-Nazi groups. Following a recent ban on
      several such organizations, right-wing extremists have
      been sending coded messages of racial hatred to one
      another through a system of computer mailboxes known as
      the Thule network.
   "CompuServe Seeks a High-Tech Answer To Fracas Over Bar on
   Adult Material."
      Industry executives said the move sets a bad precedent
      that could invite still more countries to demand their
      own diverging standards of what is acceptable. Critics
      further maintained that the approach simply won't work.
      In addition, critics voiced concern that CompuServe's
      efforts will lead to on-line services being forced to
      take responsibility for information they didn't create.

   "Worldwide Net, Worldwide Trouble" [Editorial]
      The borderless quality of the Internet, one of its great
      strengths, can now be seen also as a source of
      unprecedented and unnerving international liability.
      Just as "community standards" were used in Tennessee to
      prosecute two California-based bulletin board operators
      on obscenity charges a few years back, big commercial
      providers like CompuServe or America Online could find
      themselves facing charges based on the very different
      legal systems of a Germany or France or, for that

   Here's Littman on what the Feds knew about Markoff at
   Raleigh (Orsak and Murphy are with Sprint Cellular; Kent
   Walker was US Attorney in San Francisco):
   Monday afternoon, Special Agent LeVord Burns sits by the
   coffee pot and vending machine at the Sprint switch and
   debates the legal issues with Shimomura. "Tsutomu wanted us
   to kick his door down," recalls Orsak, who along with
   Murphy, listened in. "Burns was talking about what warrants
   had been issued, what the FBI was going to do."
   Burns impresses Orsak. A well-built, bespectacled black man
   in a suit and tie, Burns looks like the kind of FBI agent
   that doesn't miss details. As Burns recounts Mitnick's
   background, Orsak is surprised by what the agent says about
   Mitnick. "Burns said there were a lot of guys that as far
   as national security went were a lot more dangerous than
   Mitnick -- that a lot of professional hackers are a lot
   more dangerous." To Orsak, cyberspace's Most Wanted Hacker
   doesn't sound all that threatening. "One of the more
   interesting things, I thought, was the FBI goes, 'As far as
   hackers go,' Mitnick was 'benign.' They didn't have
   evidence he was in it for the money."
   A little later, John Markoff and Shimomura's girlfriend,
   Julia Menapace, who just flew in, arrive at the switch.
   Orsak and Murphy invite Shimomura's team, Burns, and two
   other FBI agents from Quantico, Virginia, out to Ragazzi's,
   a casual Italian restaurant nearby. Orsak spreads out a
   Raleigh street plan on the checkered tablecloth and
   pinpoints Mitnick's location.
   "LeVord was telling us what his involvement was for the
   FBI," recalls Murphy. "It was light banter. LeVord assumed
   like we all did, that Markoff was just another guy out of
   California. Just another egghead. One of Tsutomu's."
   Markoff gets everyone's ear when he mentions Mitnick
   inspired the hit movie WarGames. "Markoff was filling us in
   on Mitnick's typical behavior, the different people Mitnick
   had run-ins with," recalls Murphy. "A guy in England, a guy
   in Princeton, one at Digital." Then, Markoff runs through
   some of Mitnick's aliases. One of the phony names rings a
   bell with Murphy. After dinner, the whole crew heads back
   to the switch, and just as Murphy suspected, he finds a
   memo describing a recent attempt by someone using the alias
   to social engineer a new bunch of MINs.
   Meanwhile, the FBI is bumping up against a technical
   problem. The agents had planned to install the FBI's own
   bulky scanning equipment in a rental van, but they can't
   find one. Murphy suggests using his co-worker Fred's
   minivan. Burns gives the idea the green light, and Orsak
   helps the agents set up and calibrate their equipment in
   Fred's van.
   Around midnight, Fred chauffeurs the two agents to circle
   the cell site to calibrate their scanning equipment. Fred
   and the FBI agents get to talking.
   "He [Fred] let the cat out of the bag," confides Murphy.
   "We didn't tell him not to say anything. We weren't trying
   to hide it, but we were also not trying to convey it. He
   told them Markoff wrote a book on this guy."
   The boys from Quantico aren't happy.
   "They freaked," recalls Murphy. "They thought Markoff would
   tip the guy [Mitnick] so he could write another book."
   One of the Quantico agents phones the Sprint switch to
   confirm Markoff's identity. "Me, Markoff, Tsutomu, and
   Julia were at the switch," remembers Murphy. "One of the
   Quantico guys was on the phone. He wanted to talk to
   Tsutomu."
   Murphy passes the phone to Shimomura.
   "He [Shimomura] wasn't about to lie," says Murphy of the
   tense moment. "He [Shimomura] was trying to evade a little
   bit. He said that Kent Walker knew about Markoff being
   there, which of course Walker did."
   Murphy, Markoff, and Menapace listen to Shimomura.
   "Kent knows about it," insists Shimomura to the agent from
   Quantico. "He's cleared through Kent."
   But Kent Walker later denied ever giving Shimomura such
   approval or knowing John Markoff was in Raleigh. Shimomura
   later disputed Murphy's account and said he "never told
   anyone from law enforcement that anyone had authorized
   Markoff's presence in Raleigh."

@_subject: Mitnik: latest? -- Long, watch it 
Perhaps Brian Davis will comment with the latest but here's
   Littman on Mitnick (and scans of Shimomura/Media/Feds)
   through October, 1995:
   As Tsutomu Shimomura launched his new careers as pitchman,
   author, movie subject, and video game designer, Kevin
   Mitnick sat in a Southern county jail. Mitnick wrote to me
   nearly every week on yellow legal paper in longhand,
   bemoaning the lack of a word processor as he recounted the
   hardships of jail. He told me he had been attacked and
   robbed by two inmates and barely avoided fights with
   several others. When he complained that the vegetarian diet
   he requested was limited to peanut butter sandwiches, and
   that his stress and stomach medication prescriptions
   weren't filled, he was moved to a tougher county jail.
   His grammar wasn't perfect, but his writing was
   surprisingly frank and descriptive. Mitnick punctuated his
   letters with Internet shorthand, noting the precise minute
   he began each letter, as if he were still online. He was
   bitter, but he hadn't lost his sense of humor. When his
   jailers admitted they'd read the letter Mike Wallace wrote
   him, inviting him to appear on 60 Minutes, Mitnick admitted
   the irony of him, of all people, complaining about other
   people reading his mail. "Poetic justice, eh? ..."
   Once in a while he'd slip in a tantalizing comment about
   his case. One week he'd appear to trust me, the next he'd
   wonder whether I would betray him. It was strange
   corresponding with the man the media and our government had
   cast as a twenty-first-century Frankenstein. Mitnick
   himself didn't seem sure of who or what he was. He asked
   whether I felt he should be given a long prison sentence.
   Did I think he was evil? Dangerous?
   When he was sent to his second jail, as a matter of policy
   the U.S. Marshals confiscated his books, his underwear, his
   toiletries. Mitnick was doing the worst prison "time"
   possible, because the Eastern District of North Carolina
   had no federal detention center. That meant he would have
   to defend himself without access to a law library, required
   by law in federal institutions. The nurse in Mitnick's
   second county jail cut his medication again, and on June
   18, his attorney filed a motion in federal court stating
   that Mitnick "was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with
   esophageal spasms." The attorney argued that the
   "deliberate indifference" to Mitnick's "serious medical
   needs" violated constitutional standards.
   Before a federal judge could order a hearing on the medical
   issues, Mitnick was transferred to his third North Carolina
   jail in as many months. "He [Mitnick] overextended his
   welcome," explained a deputy U.S. Marshal in Raleigh who
   preferred to remain anonymous. "It was time for a change of
   scenery. This happens with a lot of them. They get where
   they think they're running the place."
   Mitnick's third county jail was his worst yet. He shared a
   cell with seven other men. There was no law library, radio
   or television, and each inmate was allowed only two books
   at a time. Mitnick's were the Federal Criminal Code and the
   Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The eight men in Mitnick's
   cell were forced to share a single pencil stub that was
   taken away in the afternoon. Mitnick was allotted one sheet
   of paper a day.
   On April 10, 1995, John Dusenberry, Mitnick's public
   defender, filed a motion to suppress evidence and dismiss
   the indictment. He argued that the blank search warrants
   and the warrantless search of Mitnick's apartment violated
   the Fourth Amendment, which specifically prohibits
   unreasonable search and seizure.
   In the government's response, John Bowler, the Assistant
   U.S. Attorney in Raleigh, defended the blank search
   warrants, not an easy proposition in a free country. Bowler
   prefaced his argument by claiming, despite evidence to the
   contrary, that Shimomura tracked Mitnick on his own until
   February I4, just hours before his capture. The
   government's response to the issue of the blank search
   warrants was to blame Magistrate Wallace Dixon. Bowler
   asserted that the FBI had wanted to execute the search
   properly, but the magistrate had "upon his own initiative"
   insisted on signing the blank search warrants.
   But a judge never ruled on these arguments. The
   twenty-three-count indictment the Associated Press had
   hypothesized could land Mitnick 460 years in jail fell
   apart. The government abandoned its case in Raleigh,
   dismissing all but one of the counts in accepting a plea
   bargain from Mitnick that would likely get him time served,
   or at most eight months. The tiny story was buried in the
   back pages of the New York Times.
   "Kevin is going to come and face the music in L.A., where,
   of course, the significant case has always been," David
   Schindler, the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, told the L.A.
   Times. The newspaper said the prosecutor believed Mitnick
   would receive stiffer punishment "than any hacker has yet
   received," a sentence greater than Poulsen's four years and
   three months.
   Mitnick's letters revealed how Schindler planned to win the
   record prison term. Schindler was claiming losses in excess
   of $80 million, the amount that would garner the longest
   possible sentence for a fraud case according to the Federal
   Sentencing Guidelines. Nor would Schindler have to
   substantiate his claim. The government only had to
   "estimate" the loss. Mitnick's attorneys said the figure
   was grossly exaggerated, and added that the case rested on
   source code allegedly copied from cellular companies. There
   was no proof that Mitnick had tried to sell the code, and
   there was no evidence it could be sold for an amount
   approaching $80 million. But under the guidelines the
   absence of a profit motive was no obstacle to a long jail
   term. David Schindler was seeking an eight-to-ten-year
   sentence for Kevin Mitnick, about the same prison time
   doled out for manslaughter.
   The jailed hacker wasn't the only one whose feats were
   being hyped. By August of 1995, the advertisement in
   Publishers Weekly for Shimomura's upcoming book featured
   Mitnick's New York Times photo stamped with the caption HE
   COULD HAVE CRIPPLED THE WORLD. Declared the ad, "Only One
   Man Could Stop Him: SHIMOMURA."
   The hyperbole made me flash on what Todd Young had done in
   Seattle. The bounty hunter had tracked Kevin Mitnick down
   in a few hours with his Cellscope. Unauthorized to arrest
   him, he'd kept Mitnick under surveillance for over two
   weeks as he sought assistance. But the Secret Service
   didn't think the crimes were significant. The U.S.
   Attorney's Office wouldn't prosecute the case. Even the
   local cops didn't really care.
   When I met Young in San Francisco a couple of weeks after
   Mitnick's arrest, he was puzzled by the aura surrounding
   Shimomura and his "brilliant" capture of Kevin Mitnick. We
   both knew from independent sources that Shimomura had never
   before used a Cellscope. Young asked why the FBI would
   bring an amateur with no cellular tracking skills to
   Raleigh for the bust. If Shimomura's skill was measured by
   his ability to catch the hacker, then he was on a par with
   Todd Young, a thousand-dollar-a-day bounty hunter who never
   had the help of the FBI. The simple, unglamorous truth was
   that Kevin Mitnick, whatever his threat to cyberspace and
   society, was not that hard to find.
   I tried to get the government to answer Young's question
   about Shimomura's presence. I asked the San Francisco U.S.
   Attorney's Office and they suggested I ask the FBI. But the
   FBI had no comment. I asked Schindler, the Assistant U.S.
   Attorney in L.A., and he didn't have an answer. I asked
   Scott Charney, the head of the Justice Department's
   Computer Crime group, and he said he couldn't comment. I
   asked the Assistant U.S. Attorney who would logically had
   to have approved sending Shimomura three thousand miles to
   Raleigh, North Carolina. But Kent Walker oddly suggested I
   ask Shimomura for the answer.
   The response reminded me of what John Bowler, the Raleigh
   prosecutor, had said when I asked him how John Markoff came
   to be in Raleigh. He, too, had suggested I ask Shimomura.
   Shimomura seemed to be operating independently. outside of
   the Justice Department's control. Or was he running their
   show?
   The media appeared captivated by Shimomura's spell. Except
   for the Washington Post and The Nation, most major
   publications and the television networks accepted John
   Markoff's and Tsutomu Shimomura's story at face value.
   Kevin Mitnick's capture made for great entertainment.
   Not one reporter exposed the extraordinary relationship
   between Shimomura and the FBI. Most seemed to ignore the
   conflict of interest raised by the financial rewards
   Shimomura and Markoff received by cooperating with the FBI.
   A Rolling Stone magazine story condoned Markoff's actions,
   saying he had merely done what any journalist would do when
   presented with the possibility of a big scoop. The media
   critic for Wired suggested only that Markoff should have
   advised New York Times readers earlier of his personal
   involvement in capturing Mitnick.
   The media functioned as a publicity machine for Shimomura
   and the federal government, quickly churning out a round of
   articles arguing for tougher laws and greater security on
   the Internet. But the fury over what Assistant U.S.
   Attorney Kent Walker described as Mitnick's "billion
   dollar" crimes simply distracted the public from the real
   issues. Privacy intrusions and crime in cyberspace were old
   news, and a series of Internet break-ins after Mitnick's
   arrest proved the capture of cyberspace's most wanted
   criminal had changed little.
   The real story was that Internet providers, the new
   equivalent of phone companies on the information
   superhighway, appeared naive about how to investigate
   break-ins while protecting the privacy of their
   subscribers. After an FBI computer child-pornography
   investigation was made public in September of 1995, the
   Bureau revealed that it had read thousands of e-mail
   correspondences, and invaded the privacy of potentially
   dozens of citizens in the course of its investigation.
   Privacy activists complained that constitutional rights
   were being bulldozed, but the FBI announced the public
   should expect more of the same. "From our standpoint, this
   investigation embodies a vision of the type of
   investigatory activity we may be drawn to in the future,"
   said Timothy McNally, the special agent in charge.
   The government seemed to be promoting a hacker dragnet to
   make sure the Internet was crime free for the millions of
   dollars of commerce on its way. Kent Walker, the Assistant
   U.S. Attorney who left the Justice Department within weeks
   of Mitnick's arrest for a job with a Pacific Telesis spin-
   off, was one of the many government officials who claimed
   the FBI couldn't crack high-tech cases without people like
   Shimomura.
   Perhaps prosecutions would increase if the FBI bolstered
   its force with nonprofessionals. But where would that leave
   the law and the Constitution?

Perry's askance leads me to propose stealing Littman's
   book. It's as techno-thrilling as cypherpunks in describing
   the melodrama of unexpected human/technology malfunctions.
   True, only a bit of bare crypto in it, with Kevin advising
   Littman to use PGP so his Well mail could not be read -- as
   Kevin's e-mail to Littman was by Shimomura and Markoff.
   Littman says that was how Markoff learned of Kevin's and
   Littman's exchanges and why Markoff started hustling
   Littman for leads on Kevin to feed the trackers.
   Also, crypto-related: The fact that Shimomura's supposedly
   secret files were not protected by encryption or other
   security is what causes Littman and others to think there
   was a sting (perhaps with TLA help) rather than foolish
   vanity of the security wizard.
   Best, the book provides Clancy-like fun in deciphering the    question of why humans abuse technology to mask their    own frailty.

Littman mentions toad.com twice -- that site, a character says, suspiciously, "run by one of the founders of Sun." Used, allegedly by the perp, to get into the drawers of, Well, you BTW, Littman says, and that Markoff agrees, that it was not Mitnick who got into Shimomura's underware, but, more than likely, the "Israeli." Apparently, an incident occurred after Kevin's bust.
Agree with Tim that the Markoff/Shimomura book is needed to see both sides.
For now, Mitnick seems to be a hapless pawn. Me too, about stuff I only read about.

[Before it is publicized, KM describes for Littman the
   Christmas 1994 attack on Shimomura's systems as a "TCP/IP
   prediction packet attack." (. . .) below are by Littman.]
   Three days later, on January 23, Shimomura will describe
   the attack in a widely distributed public Internet post. IP
   source address spoofing and TCP/IP sequence number
   prediction are the technical terms Shimomura uses to
   describe it, much like Mitnick's description. But his
   analysis is extremely technical, and even some UNIX
   security experts find it tough going.
   That same day, about 2 P.M., CERT will blast out an
   advisory to its international mailing list of 12,000
   Internet sites in the United States, Germany, Australia,
   the United Kingdom, Japan, and other countries. The vaguely
   worded report is much less specific than Mitnick's
   one-minute explanation on the telephone. Most likely, CERT
   is trying to provide enough detail so Internet sites can
   protect themselves against future attacks without providing
   so much detail that it could encourage copycat attacks.
   On one level, the hack is simple, a clever strike at a
   basic weakness of the Internet. Computers on the Internet
   are often programmed to trust other computers. The Internet
   was created to share information, and the attack on
   Shimomura, just like the Robert Morris Internet Worm attack
   seven years before, exploits that trust.
   The Internet has its own way of sending e-mail or files.
   Messages or files are split into smaller digital chunks or
   packets, each with its own envelope and address. When each
   message is sent, it's like a flock of birds that migrates
   to a planned location and reunites as a flock at the
   destination. Computers on the Internet often act like great
   flocks of birds that trust one another too. And all it
   takes is one enemy bird to infiltrate the flock.
                               . . .
   On Christmas Day 1994 the attack begins.
   First, the intruder breaks into a California Internet site
   that bears the cryptic name toad.com. Working from this
   machine, the intruder issues seven commands to see who's
   logged on to Shimomura's workstation, and if he's sharing
   files with other machines. Finger is one of the common UNIX
   commands the intruder uses to probe Shimomura's machine. As
   a security professional Shimomura should have disabled the
   feature. Finger is so commonly used by hackers to begin
   attacks that 75 percent of Internet sites, or about 15
   million of the more than 20 million Internet users, block
   its function to increase security.
   The intruder's making judgment calls on the fly about which
   commands will help him uncover which machines Shimomura's
   workstation might trust. He works fast. In six minutes he
   deduces the pattern of trust between Shimomura's UNIX
   workstation and an unknown Internet server.
   Then the automatic spoofing attack begins. It will all be
   over in sixteen seconds. The prediction packet attack
   program fires off a flurry of packets to busy out the
   trusted Internet server so it can't respond. Next, the
   program sends twenty more packets to Shimomura's UNIX
   workstation.
   The program is looking for a pattern in the initial
   sequence numbers -- the numbers used to acknowledge receipt
   of data during communications. The program deciphers the
   returned packets by subtracting each sequence number from
   the previous one. It notes that each new initial sequence
   number has grown by exactly 128,000. The program has
   unlocked the sequence number key.
   Shimomura's machine has to be idle for the attack to
   succeed. New Internet connections would change the initial
   sequence number and make it more difficult to predict the
   key. That's why the hacker attacks on Christmas Day.
   The attack program sends packets that appear to be coming
   from the trusted machine. The packet's return or source
   address is the trusted machine's Internet address.
   Shimomura's workstation sends a packet back to the trusted
   machine with its initial sequence number. But flooded by
   the earlier flurry of packets, the trusted server is still
   trying to handle the earlier traffic. It's tangled up.
   Taking advantage of the gagged server, the attacking
   program sends a fake acknowledgment. It looks real because
   it's got the source address of the trusted server, and the
   correct initial sequence number. Shimomura's workstation is
   duped. It believes it's communicating with a trusted
   server.
   Now the attacking program tells Shimomura's obedient
   workstation to trust everyone. It issues the simple UNIX
   "Echo" command to instruct Shimomura's workstation to trust
   the entire Internet. At that point, Shimomura's personal
   and government files are open game to the world. It's more
   than a humiliating blow to the security expert. By making
   Shimomura's machine accessible from any Internet site, the
   intruder has masked his own location. He can return from
   anywhere.
   The hacker can't believe his good luck. The attack is only
   successful because Shimomura has not disabled the "R"
   commands, three basic commands that allow users to remotely
   log-in or execute programs without a password. Tens of
   thousands of security-conscious Internet sites,
   representing well over a million users, routinely block
   access to the R commands to avoid its well publicized abuse
   by hackers.
   It takes a few keystrokes and about thirty seconds to shut
   off the R commands on an Internet server. You don't even
   have to turn off the machine.
   Why didn't Shimomura do it?
                               . . .
   Mitnick laughs. "He's [Shimomura's] not happy. I have
   nothing to do with it. I'm just telling you what I hear
   through the grapevine."
   [Littman] "Who do you think might have done it?" I ask    the likely suspect. "How did he figure it out himself?"
   "He [Shimomura] realized that somebody had edited his
   wrapper log, which shows incoming connections. Somebody
   actually modified those logs, and then he was able to
   reconstruct what happened through these logs that were
   mailed to another site unbeknownst to the intruder."
   Mitnick's actually telling me the evidence Shimomura
   collected to figure out the attack. The wrapper is supposed
   to control connections to Shimomura's server and log all
   connection attempts. It failed to protect Shimomura but
   still it logged the hacker's spoofed connection, and a copy
   of the log was e-mailed off-site.
   "So you were asking me if there's a secure e-mail site?"
   Mitnick continues, his voice suddenly hard. "My answer is
   no. This guy in my estimation is the brightest in security
   on the whole Internet. He blows people like Neil Clift
   away. I have a lot of respect for this guy. 'Cuz I know a
   lot about him. He doesn't know anything about me,
   hopefully, but he's good.
   "On the Internet, he's one of the best in the world."
   [pp. 222-25]
   -----
   [KM] "I don't know what his motive is. I don't know
   the man at all. Alls I know is he's very technical and he's
   very good at what he does. He's in the top five."
   [JL] "What makes Shimomura so good?"
   [M] "When someone penetrates his system he knows what to
   look for. When you compile a program, it uses external
   files and libraries. This is the type of guy that would
   look at the access times of the files to try to figure out
   what type of program somebody was compiling. The guy's
   sharp."
   On UNIX systems it's possible to tell the last time a file
   was read. Mitnick's guessing that Shimomura could determine
   the type of application that was compiled (converted into
   the computer's most basic machine language) by examining
   the date stamps in certain system directories. He's also
   acknowledging he knows that the intruder compiled a program
   while he was on Shimomura's machine.
   Once again, Kevin Mitnick seems to have an amazing amount
   of detail on how Shimomura analyzes an attack.
   [M] "He's just very good at -- well, he's a spook. What do
   you expect? This is only what I hear in the grapevine." ...
   [L] "But does the grapevine say he's primarily a spook?"
   [M] "Unknown. He's good in security and he consults with
   companies like Trusted Information Systems, the people that
   develop Internet fire walls, and a lot of people in D.C.
   and the Virginia area."
   Trusted Information -- the name strikes a bell. Markoff
   quoted someone from Trusted Information in his front-page
   "Data Threat" article.
   [L] "Where is Trusted Information?"
   [M] "Oh, in Maryland, 301 area code. Baltimore, I believe."
   [L] "What are some of the Virginia companies Shimomura
   works with?"
   [M] "I just have the phone numbers," Mitnick reveals
   casually. "I haven't called them yet to see."
   [pp. 252-53]
   -----
   Why not ask John Markoff about the real reason he called me
   twice this morning?
   So I ask him about the Shimomura Newsweek story, and the
   odd reference to cellular phones. He comes back with a
   stunning revelation.
   "Somebody hit a different Tsutomu machine last summer and
   the NSA was pissed," Markoff tells me. "They freaked out.
   There's no question about it."
   Why didn't he mention this in his New York Times stories?
   Why create the false appearance Shimomura was first hacked
   Christmas Day?
   "But it was a different machine?" I ask.
   "Am I being interviewed here?"
   It strikes me as an odd question. Markoff was the one who
   called me twice in the space of an hour. Who's interviewing
   whom?
   "Let's get on the same wavelength," Markoff suggests. "I'm
   glad to share this stuff with you, but I want to know where
   it's going to show up. 'Cuz I'm pretty close to Shimo and
   it's an issue for me."
   Before I can respond, he starts talking about Shimomura
   again.
   "I wrote that profile of Tsutomu because after I mentioned
   him in the bottom of my story ["Data Threat"] I basically
   outed him and a million reporters were all over him."
   "He wasn't happy about that?"
   "No, Tsutomu loves it," Markoff says. "He's playing his own
   games.
   "I'II tell you it's unclear what was taken [referring to
   the Christmas hack], and point two, I can send you a public
   posting by an Air Force information warfare guy who
   described what was taken and their assessment of the
   damage.
   "And there are lots of little snips of code that a
   brilliant hacker could probably use. But Tsutomu's mind
   works in very cryptic ways. It's not clear that without
   Tsutomu you're going to be able to do anything with it.
   "Now in this break-in I don't actually think a lot of stuff
   was taken."
   This break-in? Just how many times was Shimomura hacked
   before Christmas?
   But I ask a different question. "Why would an Air Force guy
   post something?"
   "Oh, Tsutomu," Markoff casually replies. "He produced a lot
   of software for the Air Force."
   "Where would he post this?"
   "Oh, to a mailing list. A lot of people were concerned
   about what was taken from his [Shimomura's] machine. What
   they [the hacker] got was a lot of his electronic mail.
   Some of it's kind of embarrassing. [But] I don't think
   people are going to find new ways to attack the network
   based on this particular attack.
   "There is another issue," Markoff cautions in a serious
   tone.
   "Tsutomu is a very sharp guy, and it is not impossible that
   that was a bait machine, which is why I stayed away from
   the issue."
   Is Markoff implying Shimomura, a rumored NSA spy, laid a
   trap? And what about Markoff's New York Times articles?
   Were they part of the trap, too?
   "Think about it for a second," Markoff pauses dramatically.
   "And you get into this wilderness-of-mirrors kind of world.
   And a lot of people that are writing don't know everything,
   and I don't know everything.
   "I've been protecting him [Shimomura] for five years. I get
   the profile and the [Wall Street] Journal is on him. They
   don't know how close he is to the military. It would make
   perfect sense. Who knows what's on the code? The guy is in
   the counterintelligence business."

These fine-minders, supported by the burgeoning private investigative and security fields, will surely mine electronic archives as thoroughly as they research paper -- and thanks to wondrous Altavistas maybe more thoroughly.
And backed by these highly skilled lobbyists, laws will change to make remunerative rain of -- and by -- archiving and search technology as they have to capitalize on the technology of doing the same in the worlds of printing, telegraph, telephone and television.
Promotion of these privacy-invasive services on the Net parallels the defensive measures explored on cypherpunks.

For the curious, Fresh Kills is NYC's main waste archive, the largest built structure in the US (a favorite of Japanese techno-tourists exceeding 256 Great Pyramids of Egypt) and still heaping.
Archeologists are indeed excavating selected spots, under grants made after probes revealed that decomposition was not occurring as expected. Newspapers and such were perfectly preserved after years of burial. Due to sophisticated engineering of the mountain to prevent dispersal, air and moisture could not enter to lubricate return to mother earth.
However, very profitable methane gas retrieval has been taking place for many years -- which may be a suitable metaphor for mining electronic archives.

@_subject: Toad Hall 
Chapter 2 TOAD HALL    In keeping with Internet nomenclature, Toad Hall acquired
   the Internet domain name toad.com, whose gateway to the
   rest of the world was a Sun SPARCstation computer in the
   building's basement. This digital domain was run by John
   and an eclectic band of programmers and hardware gurus, who
   together had a diverse political outlook, and while privacy
   was a priority, computer security at Toad was often pretty
   loose. ...
   For the past five years, Toad Hall had been Julia
   [Menapace]'s home -- for John Gilmore was the "other man,"
   with whom her relationship had been souring even before she
   and I had met. During the Christmas holidays John was away
   visiting his relatives in Florida, and so Julia and I had
   Toad Hall to ourselves when we arrived around 4 P.M. on the
   afternoon of her flight from Nepal.
   John, now forty, was someone I'd known from hacker circles,
   and even as a friend, for a number of years. ... Initially
   he hadn't minded that Julia and I spent time backpacking
   together while he worked long hours on his new start-up,
   because hiking didn't interest him. But once Julia and I
   had become more intimately involved, things grew chilly
   between him and me.
   Julia and I sent out for dinner from an Italian place
   called Bambino's. When it came, we undressed and sank into
   the indoor hot tub, eating while we soaked.
   The upstairs bathroom in Toad Hall is an unusual room. It
   is faced with a white and pink marble floor and wainscoting
   surrounding a dark green jacuzzi tub and other fixtures. A
   large asparagus fern sits on the window ledge, centered
   above the cascading waterfall of the tub's larger faucet.
   The fronds of the fern tumble down toward the water. Julia
   had, put on a cassette tape of Karma Moffet playing
   Himalayan intruments, and then lit candles; the only other
   light came from four overhead spotlights that dimly
   illuminated each corner of the tub.
   "This is just amazing," Julia murmured through the steamy
   air. She said she had fantasized continually about a long
   soak in hot water while trekking in the frigid Himalayas,
   where water is carried by hand from its source and becomes
   hot only when heated over flames, and where there is never
   enough to sit in. And at high altitude in the Solu Khumbu
   region of Nepal, the only heat had come from the sun, the
   small cooking fire, and the occasional woodstove fueled by
   wood scraps or dung.
   While we ate Julia told me stories of her adventures. In
   the kitchen of a lodge where she stayed she met and
   befriended a Sherpa guide named Tshering and a mountain
   guide from Seattle named Rachel DeSilva, who had led a
   group of 12 women to climb a 6,000-meter trekking peak in
   the region named Mara. Afterward they had invited her to
   climb another mountain named Lobuche, which lay to the
   north toward Everest. She had made it to just below the
   summit.
   I sat entranced. "I wish I had been there too," was all I
   could find to say.
   Julia had spent her birthday at the Tengboche monastery to
   celebrate the Mani Rimdu festival. She showed me a red
   string necklace that she had received when a Tibetan Lama
   had blessed her on her thirty-fifth birthday.
   "Near noon that same day, I heard the sound of long horns,
   cymbals, and drums," she recalled. "Then an avalanche
   poured in slow motion down the south face of Ama Dablam."
   Later in the trip she had stopped at one point to watch a
   sunset over Everest through the gathering mist, and she
   said it was so stark and beautiful that she cried. "I
   thought of you," she told me, "and wished you were there to
   share it with me."
   As we soaked, I told her about what had happened to me
   while she was gone. When Julia left I had been waiting for
   a $500,000 per year research grant from the National
   Security Agency, the nation's electronic intelligence-
   gathering organization. The NSA has two missions: one, its
   foreign spying mission and the other its responsibility for
   the security of all the governments computers and
   communications. In the fall an information security
   division in the agency had told me they would fund a
   project permitting me to assemble a team of experts to do
   research in new areas of computer security. I was ready to
   go and I had commitments from people to start work, but the
   agency had dragged its feet for months. Finally I had
   gotten tired of being jerked around, and two of my
   researchers had been forced to take other jobs.
   "I thought everything would be ironed out and I'd come back
   to find you happily at work with your team," she said.
   "No it wasn't," I answered. "They're amazingly inept, just
   like any government bureaucracy."
   We talked for a while about the NSA and how so many people
   in the civil liberties community fear them as Big Brother
   as well as anyone associated with them, arguing that they
   become corrupted by association. But that had never seemed
   accurate to me. Everything I'd seen indicated they were a
   largely incompetent organization tied up in endless
   regulations that could do little good or evil. And people
   are quite capable of making up their own minds.
   "I don't want to deal with them," I said.
   "I'm sorry it didn't work out, Tsutomu," she said quietly.
   We soaked for a while, both of us lost in thought. Finally
   I changed the subject.
   "I want to tell you something I've been thinking about," I
   said. "I've thought about a lot of things while you were
   away. I'd really like to try having a committed
   relationship with you, if you're willing to."
   Julia smiled. She didn't say anything, but she reached over
   and held me closely.
   It seemed like we would now be able to share a lot of time
   together. I told her I'd taken a leave of absence from the
   universlty and now I was looking forward to skiing and
   getting away. I was finally pursuing my long-held plan to
   spend a winter in the mountains, spending the mornings and
   late afternoons skiing and the mid-days and evenings
   thinking and working on my research projects.
   "Why don't you come with me and live in the mountains?" I
   suggested. "You can come ski and it will be good to be
   outside."
   We woke at about 1 P.M. the next day and Julia -- who grew
   up on the East Coast and is still learning to deal with
   mild California winters -- told me that she had seen the
   first morning light before she fell asleep and thought to
   herself, *It's Christmas and there is no sign of it here.*
   She was still jet-lagged and also feeling what she feared
   was flu coming on. We decided to spend the day inside,
   catching up on talk and sleep. It was chilly out, so Julia
   turned up Toad Hall's central heat, still eager to soak up
   the warmth of civilization after two months in the
   Himalaya.
   A bit later, while she rested, I was walking around the
   house, and several times went past the Sun SPARCstation in
   the hallway. It was a reminder that I probably had new
   electronic mail, but I didn't feel like checking it.
   At just about that moment, however, ominous bits of data
   were flowing through the Ethernet cable that wound through
   Toad's rooms and hallways. From somewhere, perhaps
   thousands of kilometers away, an electronic intruder had
   taken control of toad.com by remotely commandeering the
   SPARCstation in the basement. And while the two of us spent
   the day together two floors above, the electronic hijacker
   was using toad.com as a staging base to launch an attack on
   the computers in my own beach house some 800 kilometers
   south.

Shimomura on BPF, NSA and Crypto:
   One of the tools I modified for my work was a sophisticated
   piece of software called the Berkeley Packet Filter. ...
   Unlike the original BPF, my version was designed to bury
   itself inside the operating system of a computer and watch
   for certain information as it flowed through the computer
   from the Internet. When a packet from a certain address, or
   for that matter any other desired piece of information
   designated by the user flashed by, BPF would grab it and
   place it in a file where it could be kept for later
   viewing.
   I had developed my initial version of the faster BPF in the
   expectation that I would receive additional research
   funding for the work from the National Security Agency. The
   Agency had begun supporting my work under a Los Alamos
   National Labs research grant in 1991, and had promised to
   extend their support for my work, but the funding was never
   forthcoming. I developed the tool, but after I completed
   the work, in early 1994, the bureaucrats in the agency
   reneged on funding.
   The idea of working with the NSA is controversial in the
   community of security professionals and civil libertarians,
   many of whom regard the NSA as a high-tech castle of
   darkness.
   Libertarian by inclination or by the influence of their
   colleagues, the nation's best computer hackers tend to
   possess a remarkable sensitivity to even the slightest hint
   of a civil liberties violation. They view with deep
   distrust the work of the National Security Agency, which
   has the twin missions of electronic spying around the globe
   and protecting the government's computer data. This
   distrust extends to anyone who works with the agency. Am I
   contaminated because I accepted research funding from the
   NSA? The situation reminds me of the scene in the movie Dr.
   Strangelove where General Jack D. Ripper is obsessed by the
   idea of his bodily fluids being contaminated. I think the
   idea of guilt by association is absurd.
   My view is very different. First of all, I don't believe in
   classified research and so I don't do it. The work I was
   undertaking on packet-filtering tools was supposed to be
   funded by the agency for public release. The tools were to
   be made widely available to everyone, to use against the
   bad guys who were already using similar tools to invade
   people's privacy and compromise the security of machines on
   the Internet.
   But even more to the point, I believe that the agency,
   rather than inherently evil, is essentially inept. Many
   people are frightened of the NSA, not realizing that it is
   like any other bureaucracy, with all of a bureaucracy's
   attendant failings. Because the NSA staff lives in a
   classified world, the government's normal system of checks
   and balances doesn't apply. But that doesn't mean that
   their technology outpaces the open computer world; it just
   means they're out of touch and ponderous.
   In any case, I feel strongly that tools like BPF are
   absolutely essential if the Internet is to have real
   security, and if we are to have the ability to trace
   vandals through the Net. If people are concerned that
   individual privacy is at stake, they should probably worry
   less about who should have the right to monitor the
   networks, and instead focus their efforts on making
   cryptographic software widely available. If information is
   encrypted it doesn't matter who sees it if they can't read
   the code. Cryptography is another example of my point that
   a tool is just a tool. It was, after all, used primarily by
   kings, generals, and spies until only two decades ago. Then
   work done by scientists at Stanford, MIT, and UCLA, coupled
   with the advent of the inexpensive personal computer, made
   encryption software available to anyone. As a result, the
   balance of power is dramatically shifting away from the NSA
   back toward the individual, and toward protecting our civil
   liberties.

Yes, indeed. James Bamford in "The Puzzle Palace" details the long-term TLA-access to international cable traffic -- via Operation Shamrock -- beginning in 1945 and ostensibly ending in 1975. See Chapter 6, "Targets."
Aside, in this chapter Bamford writes that Louis Tordella, who died earlier this week, "The Agency's chief keeper of the secrets," was central to targeting of thousands of Americans. Bamford says of Tordella, "If NSA was the darkest part of the government, Tordella was the darkest part of the NSA." Tordella allegedly shielded various NSA heads by not telling them what was going on -- to their great relief.
David Kahn in "The Codebreakers" more extensively examines the history of spying on citizens in the national interest. It will be interesting to read what he is currently researching at the more PR-oriented NSA -- and perhaps provide pointers to deep-blacker orgs that have supplanted it through non-FOIA arrangements like those of Shamrock.

   In a related matter, on Friday C-SPAN 2 aired several hours

   Commission on Intelligence Reform. Mephistophelean former
   NSA head Admiral Bobby Ray Inman proposed among other
   brain-wavers to reorganize the thirteen or so bloated,
   bumbling, cat-fighting intelligence agencies:
   1. Establish a new International Operations Agency to
      combine all operations units -- civilian and military --
      into one, separate from the CIA -- which he thinks has
      irretrievably lost operations credibility.
   2. CIA to do all intelligence analysis, but no collecting,
      to avoid contamination caused by "ownership of the
      data." The military to do intelligence collection and
      analysis only needed for immediate operations.
   3. FBI to do all counter-intelligence, domestic and
      international, with agents stationed overseas.
   4. Defense to do all imagery.
   5. NSA/NRO/???, though not named in open session,
      presumably would continue ELINT and SIGINT.
   6. All this will be very expensive, he roostered,
      intelligence on the cheap is worthless.
   7. The total intelligence budget to be made public but no
      further breakdown of how the the pot of gold is
      distributed to supplicants is to be confessed.
   Former Ambassador to China Tilley, a 25-year veteran of CIA
   operations, emphasized the importance of continuing Non
   Official Cover operations, which, he said, are invaluable
   very-long term penetrations. He cited those he set up in
   China as COS and then revisited fifteen years later as
   ambassador -- still ferreting deepest of demon red-commie
   secrets, he black-comicly glowered to the glazed-eyes. NOC,
   while very expensive, is crucial, he, too, parroted.
   For the full eye-opening pack of lies to replenish the pot    gold, Tilley co-conspired that a closed session was needed.
   But all the intel gold-digging experts testified to that,
   grinning malevolently, thus continuing the grand tradition
   of looting national treasuries top-secret cloaked by
   national interest.
   So, where are all those not-yet-reported CIA Non Official
   Cover stashes of gold bullion (or $100 bills) to pay the

   More generally, Wright compares the two books, muses on

   outlines what might be done about Internet insecurity:
   1. Police -- by legislation for officials to monitor

   2. Privatize -- by IPs policing their own turf.
   3. Encrypt -- like cypherpunks.
   He comments on PRZ's case, notes possible infowar-type
   threats and closes:
      Given that federal officials who would constrain
      encryption seem to be swimming against the nearly
      inexorable tide of technological history, these are the
      [cyber-terrorism] kinds of scenarios they have to
      conjure up to justify their efforts. And these scenarios

   "Standoff in Cyberspace Gulch," by a Yankelovich author of
   the recent Cybercitizen Survey, reports on the showdown
   shaping up as the law moves into cyberspace, highlighting
   the clash between citizen fears about security and the
   desire for privacy, with stats from Yankelovich polls.
      The quandary here -- that regulations are both thought
      to be needed, yet anticipated to fail -- is the biggest
      issue, and one that puts additional pressure on the
      limits of cyberspace privacy. This crisis of confidence,
      as much as lawlessness itself, could easily choke the
      growth of cyberspace.

@_subject: The Politics of Mistrust 
The Washington Post initiates today a 6-part series on the
   loss of trust in all American institutions, "The Politics
   of Mistrust," based on a recent poll sponsored by the    Post, Harvard and the Kaiser Family Foundation.
   While not directly related to technical crypto, a number    of findings parallel discussions here about the diminution
   of personal and economic security. Samples:
      America is becoming a nation of suspicious strangers,
      and this mistrust of each other is a major reason
      Americans have lost confidence in the federal government
      and virtually every other major national institution.
      Every generation that has come of age since the 1950s
      has been more mistrusting of human nature, a
      transformation in the national outlook that has deeply
      corroded the nation's social and political life.
      Mistrustful Americans repeatedly expressed far less
      confidence in the federal government, the military, the
      Supreme Court, Congress and the Clinton administration
      than the dwindling numbers of Americans who were more
      upbeat about human nature.
      Fear of crime, economic insecurity and pessimism about
      the lives of future generations all have separately
      added to the belief that government is either making
      things worse or is incapable of making them better.
      Today, a clear majority of respondents in their early
      20s said they do not trust their fellow Americans, a view
      they share with one in four Americans over the age of
      60. "It's like living in the cave man age," said a 29-
      year-old. "Nobody cares anymore. Nobody cares. They will
      no sooner run you down and run away than to spit in your
      face."
      An environment in which a majority of Americans believe
      that most people can't be trusted breeds attitudes that
      hold all politicians as corrupt, venal and self-serving,
      and government action is doomed to failure.
      Wages have stagnated, workers change jobs frequently and
      downsizing corporations offer little protection even to
      the most loyal of employees.
      Americans who feel most pessimistic about the economy
      also are more likely to see the government as a threat.
   Harvard and Kaiser are to separately publish their own
   analysis of the poll.
   The first article offers much more detail and is quite
   long, about a page and a half. Perhaps someone might offer
   a site where this and others in the series could be made
   available as they appear. If so, send me a note.

Spy Agency Said to Have Spare Billions
     The National Reconnaissance Office, the secret agency
     that builds spy satellites, lost track of more than $2 billion in
     classified money last year, largely because of its own      secrecy, intelligence officials say.
     In the past, congressional oversight of the reconnaissance      has been sketchy, because few members of Congress
     understood the highly technical language of spy satellites and some
     did not know what they were approving when they authorized      of dollars a year in secret spending.

   Try for Al Bayse, formerly assistant director of the FBI's
   Technical Services Division and its long-time senior
   techonology expert. Here's a quote from David Burnham's new
   book, "Above the Law:"
      Al Bayse, whom FBI documents suggest has been involved
      in the Clipper since its inception, was ecstatic about
      its inception. Shortly before the White House announced
      the project to reporters, he telephoned the three
      leading security experts in the academic world --
      Dorothy Denning of Georgetown University, Lance Hoffman
      of George Washington University and Peter Neumann of SRI
      International -- and informed them that the FBI's
      problem had been solved. (p. 150)
   Burnham claims that because Bayse shaped and directed the
   FBI's investigative technologies from the late 1970s to the
   mid-1990s he "may well be the nation's single most
   influential law enforcement official since J. Edgar
   Hoover." (p. 136)

@_subject: Technology and Privacy 
The Washington Post, July 1, 1996, p. A16.    Technology and Privacy [Letter]    In reference to the May 31 editorial "Plant Lights and    Privacy" commenting on an 11th Circuit Court of Appeals    decision to uphold the use of thermal imaging in cases    involving indoor marijuana growing operations: The U.S.    Supreme Court had just declined to review that 11th Circuit    decision.    On June 11, The Post published a letter from Jack King    ["When Government Can Look Through Walls"] warning us that    thermal imaging, as developed by the military and as used    by civilian law enforcement agencies with the cooperation    of the military, posed an Orwellian threat to citizens    because the government could use the technology to tell if    two people were making love in the privacy of their    bedroom.    To set the record straight, military thermal imaging is    used to support civilian law enforcement only after other    probable cause for a search warrant, such as power bills,    observation of boarded-up windows, vents on the roof to    draw away heat and buys by confidential informants, are    documented. The military is then called in, using thermal    imagers, to determine if there is an unusual heat source in    the house as detected by heat escaping from the house. In    dozens of cases where thermal imaging was used, I have not    observed one case where it could detect the activity of    people in a house, let alone a bedroom. I also have not    observed the technology to have the ability to detect what    people are doing in any room behind closed doors, covered    windows and walls other than to detect blurs or shadows    moving around behind light curtains.    The United States v. Cusumano language quoted by Mr. King    was reversed last month by the court because the original    three judges decided it was an issue that didn't need    deciding, i.e. the constitutionality of thermal imaging    absent a search warrant, and did not exercise "judicial    restraint."    The trend to Mr. King's "militarization" of the war on    drugs, based on a decision by then-secretary of defense    Richard Cheney that drug use represented a threat to our    national security, is being carried out with restraint,    respect for the law and an appropriate appreciation for the    privacy of our citizens.

To complement Tim May's essay on the Net and Terrorism:    The Washington Post, July 1, 1996, Business, p. 22.    Keeping the Military in High Tech [Excerpts]    At Camber Corporation in Springfield, Va., posters, comic    strips and colorful Silicon Graphics Inc. computers dot the    office landscape. Employees banter as they work.    Technical director Bryan Ware, 26, serves as the bridge     between the college-age computer programmers and the     military commanders who authorize the projects. "A lot of     military people don't know or trust technology," he said.     "A lot of computer nerds don't know or trust the military.    I know and like both."    The Army had a congressional mandate to prepare for    terrorists using chemical, biological or even nuclear    weapons and for civilian doctors having to figure out how    to treat the victims. To that end, the Army contracted    Camber to create the Nuclear Biological Chemical Medical    Defense Information Server which has many more bells and    whistles than the average Web site.    On the opening page, "danger" signs line the background.    Articles on the latest terrorist catastrophes appear in the    center of the screen. Black illuminated links to the site's    library, to news and to other information fill the    left-hand side.    Click on the library link, and medical manuals on nuclear,    biological and chemical warfare treatments appear. To the    left, a video section link becomes visible. Click on it,    and an interactive session begins between the user and an    actor playing the role of nuclear, chemical or biological    warfare victim. If the user administers the proper    treatment (it's good to read the library manuals before    going to the video), the victim will survive. If the user    fails to administer the correct procedures, the victim will    die.    "We try to have fun," said Alex Neifert, 21, who's working    on the Army Web site project for the summer before heading    back to the University of Michigan's Graduate School of    Information in the fall.    "We're hoping to improve the preparedness of the military    and civilian communities to deal with these types of    problems. This site will give doctors access to important    information that could save lives in the event of a    terrorist action," said the Army officer in charge of the    project.    Camber and the military hope that 1,000 visitors will view    the Web site daily when it officially opens July 3. To    access the site, point your browser to:     -----

7-2-96 UST, page one:    "Companies fear losing privacy, customers' trust."       In a show of self-reliance reminiscent of the old West,       companies are taking matters into their own hands,       hiring security firms to protect their computer systems       and ignoring the convention that law enforcement is the       best defense. It's a stance that has implications for       law enforcement and commerce, raises broad questions of       privacy and control, and pits the philosophy of the       Clinton administration directly against that of many       Fortune 500 companies. "An organization has very little       to gain" by reporting, says Lloyd Hession, of IBM's       Business Recovery Services.       There seems to be universal agreement that the strongest       means for securing computer data against theft lies in       cryptography, but the Clinton administration, citing       fears that criminals would use cryptography to cloak       their activities, is setting regulations slowing       development of cryptography software.

Would anyone know more about the DEA "process the intercepts by computer"
in the excerpt below from today's Wash Post? Any connection to Peter
Neuman's remarks at the CRISIS press conference about LEA training and
technology as alternatives to breaking strong crypto?    This new funding has been a factor in making possible    increased use of electronic surveillance. Federal wiretaps    cost more than $70,000 a month to operate and generate    hundreds of hours of labor for monitors, transcribers,    surveillance teams and investigators. Larger budgets mean    cost is less of an obstacle.    Building for the future, the DEA is carrying out a $33    million program to replace single-line wiretapping gear    with new equipment that can monitor 40 lines simultaneously    and process the intercepts by computer. The FBI is plowing    millions into developing new intercept techniques for    digital lines and expanding its cadre of agents who use the    bureau's high tech surveillance gear.    "I don't think J. Edgar Hoover would contemplate what we    can do today in terms of technology," Reno testified during    a Senate hearing in May.    The total number of federal wiretaps is just one measure of    the rise in federal surveillance. The build-up also is    evident in the increased use of electronic devices that    record the numbers dialed by a target telephone, and the    origin of calls to it.    These devices allow agents to identify a person's    associates. Beginning in 1993, Justice agencies began using    the court-authorized monitors more often and leaving them    installed for longer periods of time, according to a    Justice Department report.

@_subject: NIST on PKI 
Business Wire, 9 July 1996:    Note To Editors: For more information on the NIST    initiative, please refer to the NIST press release: "NIST,    Industry Partners to Develop Specifications for Public Key    Infrastructure," July 9, 1996.    ----------     Certicom to Partner with NIST to Develop Specifications for    a Public Key Infrastructure; Certicom signs agreement with    NIST to contribute cryptographic expertise    Toronto -- Certicom Corp. a leading information security    company, today announced that it will participate in an    initiative by the U.S. Commerce Department's National    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) which will    lead to the development of the elements of a public key    infrastructure (PKI).     A PKI will enable individuals and organizations who have    never met to electronically send and receive documents    which have been digitally signed.    NIST announced today that it is partnering with several    companies who bring specialized experience in providing    products or services related to PKI components.    "Certicom is excited about the establishment of this PKI    project. It represents a proactive initiative by the    Commerce Department to develop standards based on existing    technology and commercial and government requirements by    soliciting the active participation of key industry    players," said Skip Hirsh, Director of U.S. Government    Marketing for Certicom.    "The strong leadership position taken by NIST will    accelerate the deployment of practical public key    infrastructures essential for the secure exchange of    electronic data."    "Certicom will contribute significant cryptographic    experience to the partnership, particularly with the    Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC) which is the most    efficient public key technology available," commented Gary    Hughes, president and CEO of Certicom. "ECC is a critical,    enabling technology for this NIST project because of its    efficiency in the high volume applications that are common     in PKIs." ...    Other partners that NIST has signed cooperative research    and development agreements (CRADAs) with include: AT&T    Government Markets, BBN Corp., Cylink Corp., DynCorp    Information & Technology Inc., Information Resource    Engineering Inc., Motorola, Northern Telecom Ltd. (Nortel),    SPYRUS, Inc. and VeriSign, Inc.    The goal of the partnership is to develop a minimum    interoperability specification for the technical components    of a PKI. The results will be shared with participating    companies, the appropriate standards-making bodies, federal    government agencies and industry organizations that are    working on aspects of PKI development.    A public key infrastructure relies on public key    cryptography in which each user has a key pair consisting    of a public and private key. The public key must be    digitally signed by a central authority to ensure its    authenticity. Digital signatures are cryptographic    techniques which are used for data integrity,    authentication and nonrepudiation.    The process of digitally signing public keys is known as    certification and is the main purpose of a public key    infrastructure.    Certicom expects to demonstrate the benefits ECC provides    to large-scale PKIs in which numerous users are signing and    verifying documents.    Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems have the highest strength per    bit of any known public key system, minimizing the    requirement for large key sizes. Cryptographic processes    based on ECC provide efficient computation techniques which    reduce communications and computation time, thereby    substantially reducing costs.    Certicom is a developer of information security products    and technologies and is the leader in Elliptic Curve    Cryptosystems, the world's most efficient public key    technology. The company specializes in applications where    the combination of cryptographic strength and high    efficiency are critical. Certicom's primary markets are in    wireless, smart cards, banking and electronic commerce over    the Internet.    Visit Certicom's home page at      -----

ISBN 0-465-00781-3    Mr. Bailey, a former senior manager at the Thinking    Machines Corporation, foresees an "electronic computing    revolution" whose "intellectual impact will be greater than    anything since the Renaissance, possibly greater than    anything since the invention of language." In his view, the    greatest challenge posed by the computer revolution will be    for humans to trust processes of thinking they won't    necessarily understand, such as neural networks spotting    patterns without supplying proof "in any human-absorbable    form."    His main point is that we must become aware of the outmoded    abstractions on which our sequential thinking is based and    to jettison them in favor of parallel processes. He cites    Alfred North Whitehead: "A civilization which cannot burst    through its current abstractions is doomed to sterility    after a very limited burst of progress." The wonder of Mr.    Bailey's book is that he makes us aware of things abstract    that all our lives we have been trained to think of as    concrete.    -----      (7 kb)    WON_der

At least 11 New York City police officers have been       accused of failing to pay any Federal taxes for several       years by declaring they each had 98 dependents and by       insisting that the Government had no right to tax them.

Wall Street Journal, July 17, 1996    Panel to Oversee Protecting Systems From Hackers    Washington -- President Clinton ordered the creation of a    commission to recommend laws and regulations to protect    vital government and private systems against attacks by    terrorists or computer hackers.    Jamie Gorelick, deputy U.S. attorney general, described the    effort as having the "same level of urgency" as the    Manhattan Project, the crash World War II effort to develop    the atomic bomb. She said the commission, which will be    headed by an appointee from the private sector, will have    a large representation from corporations, because they    control the nation's telecommunications system,    electrical-power grid, banking, transportation and    fuel-supply systems.    "We are looking for a structure that cuts across the    government and private sector," Ms. Gorelick told the    Senate's Permanent Investigations Subcommittee. While some    22 federal agencies have some involvement with such    problems, she said there is no central mechanism.    While the new Commission on Critical Infrastructure    Protection deliberates, President Clinton ordered the    Federal Bureau of Investigation to head an interim task    force.    [End]

Because of these concerns, Mondex has been modified in       the United States so that banks will be able to track       card use. That will allow them to audit for fraud, if       not recreate every transaction. Data from Mondex cards       will be used for various product marketing.

@_subject: Devil's Bargain 
The New York Times, July 21, 1996, WIR, p. 5.    The Devil's Bargain of a Better World    By Tim Weiner    Washington. The arc of the burning plane falling into the    ocean, the fire glowing on the dark waters, shed light on    how vulnerable we are. When a jumbo jet falls from the sky,    technology has failed or terrorism has succeeded.    In the hours after Flight 800 went down off Fire Island,    everyone in officialdom said there was no reason to believe    it was a terrorist attack. Nearly everyone else    instinctively believed it was.    However the facts turn out, it is revealing that Americans    thought first of a bomb borne by angry men on a mission    from God. There was no more evidence to blame it on it was    close enough to truth, given the absence of facts,    Americans' shared fear of terror and their faith in    technology.    In any event, if the crash turns out to have been an    accident -- horrible but still an act of God -- the relief    may be fleeting.    "It doesn't matter whether it was a bomb or not, in the way    we think of it -- it's what we expect," said Ronald Steel,    professor of International relations at the University of    Southern California and author of "Temptations of a    Superpower" (Harvard, 1995). "We know it's going to happen    somewhere --if not this airplane, then the World Trade    Center, Lockerbie, the bombs in Saudi Arabia and Paris and    London. This is a part of our life. If for some reason this    wasn't a bomb, we better get ready for one tomorrow." [See    Steel's NYT Op-Ed today:     High-Tech Freedom    With the doubled-edge sword of technology, Americans have    carved a world of gleaming aircraft and guided missiles.    The airplanes that transport them, the cell phones and    television cables and computers that link them, define how    they live, how they work, how they take their pleasure.    They are right up there with freedom of speech and    religion, freedom from want and fear. They make America    rich, powerful, and free.    But Americans cannot control technology; increasingly, it    controls them. And when the people Americans fear get their    hands on it, the fear is accelerated and amplified by 500    channels of interwoven media hype.    The airlines and telephones and E-mail that connect    Americans connect those other people too: a computer disk    is the crucial piece of evidence in the current trial of    Ramzi Ahmed Yusef, accused of planning to blow a fleet of    commercial planes from the sky (and in a pending case, of    leading the World Trade Center bombing).    The subway rider poisoned in Tokyo and the American soldier    blown out of bed in Dhahran share a common knowledge: High    technology may make a fine sword, but it is a flawed    shield. It cannot stop every nut with a grudge.    Americans are slowly getting used to the idea that one can    no longer go through the world without passing through    security. They are learning to live with terror and the    technology of counter-terrorism, as people have for years    in Tel Aviv and Cairo, Belfast and Berlin, Karachi and    Algiers. They all visit those cities now; they enter them    every time they walk through a metal detector.    So life feels more and more like an international airport:    identity checkpoints and security zones in concrete and    glass buildings, pretty flowers planted in concrete    barricades outside, robot voices delivering warnings.    The fear means they arrive early to spend more down time    waiting in line to pass through security. So they adapt,    thinking: That's not a barricade, it's a flowerpot. They    give up a little freedom in exchange for feeling safe, "all    watched over," as the late poet Richard Brautigan wrote,    "by machines of loving grace."    Visitors    The people who hate, love, envy and fear America's    prosperity and power, also pass through that international    airport. The United States needs their oil for fuel; it    needs their sweat for work Americans don't do any more.    They are woven into America, traveling through open lines    of trade and telecommunications and technology.    So everybody learns to live with the fear of the bomb in    the cargo bay: you have to catch that plane if you have    business abroad. If the United States were determined to    buy machines that could sniff out the Semtex in the    boombox, it could have done it -- the cost is perhaps $2    billion, or slightly less than one Stealth nuclear bomber.    But that is not the war Washington prepared to fight after    Vietnam. Generals today want wars they are sure to win.    We -- the United States -- have the smart bombs, built with    the billions that bankrupted Moscow and made America Number    One. They -- the furious and the powerless -- have the dumb    bombs, made from fertilizer and fuel oil, ignited by rage    and religion. But the United States can't stop them all,    not with its ever-tightening laws, not with its trillion-    dollar military, not with its weapons and warheads. So the    thinking goes.    On the simplest level, terrorism works: it terrifies. It    can increase the technology of control and erode the edges    of the Constitution. That can fuel the fear of Big Brother,    make people paranoid -- and in turn promote the homegrown    madness that exploded last year in Oklahoma City. Terrorism    cannot destroy the United States, but it has the power to    wound, outrage, sadden and change it.    When Iranians took Americans hostage and controlled the    nation's politics from half a world away, when a suicide    bomber blew up 241 American soldiers in Beirut and drove    the Marines from Lebanon, when the World Trade Center    shook, when the Dhahran barracks went up in smoke, it    expressed a burning anger in the world, the anger of the    poor and the powerless and the God-mad and the stateless.    The Method    Through repetition, Americans are slowly coming to    recognize the method in this madness: These attacks are    meant as blows against the global dominance of American    culture, money, power and technology.    Mr. Steel says the United States' stature as the one    surviving superpower and the architect of the new world    order is the very thing that makes it a target.    "Terror," he says, "is the weapon that the powerless use    against the powerful. We don't have any conception of what    an ideologically threatening power we are to people who    have different beliefs. Globalization and modernization are    truly threatening to people. They're even threatening to    the working class in this country because they drive down    wages. The very faith in technology that we spread is    something that runs head-on into another faith based on    tradition, asceticism and authority. We're the alien    ideology now."    [End] ----------    The New York Times, July 21, 1996, p. 25.    Top F.B.I. Investigator Is Known for Bluntness    James K. Kallstrom the head of the Federal Bureau of    Investigation s New York City office, is a technical wizard    who has bugged, wiretapped and generally bedeviled    mobsters, terrorists and other criminals for more than two    decades.    The crash investigation is the first major, high-profile    investigation of Mr. Kallstrom's tenure of a year and a    half. Since Wednesday night, Mr. Kallstrom has spent most    of his time shuttling, in a Blackhawk military helicopter,    between the F.B.I. command center, at 26 Federal Plaza in    Lower Manhattan, and the crash site, where he has held two    press conferences a day with a top official of the National    Transportation Safety Board.    Mr. Kallstrom is known for a no-nonsense, blunt approach    with his colleagues. He also never passes up a chance to    express some strongly felt opinions, they say. Often, Mr.    Kallstrom has offered his long-held view that Congress is    not doing enough to help Federal law enforcement in its    fight against criminals who use new technologies, such as    the Internet.    Since the crash Wednesday night, Mr. Kallstrom has had a    strong suspicion that it was tied to a bomb or missile.    "You have a lot of things that look like terrorism," Mr.    Kallstrom said at a press conference Friday afternoon. "At    some point in time, we're going to reach critical mass and    then we're going to be prepared to say exactly what we    think it is." As late as last night, he said he had not    seen anything to make him change that opinion. But    publicly, at least, Mr. Kallstrom has been reluctant to    declare that the crash was caused by a bomb or missile    until physical evidence, enough to reach a "beyond a    reasonable doubt" threshold, is found.    By selecting Mr. Kallstrom as assistant director in charge    of the New York Office in February 1995, the F.B.I.    Director, Louis J. Freeh, chose one of the bureau's most    respected surveillance experts, a man whose techniques    played a critical role in the arrests of every major    organized crime leader and terrorist in New York in the    last 20 years, including those involved with the World    Trade Center bombing in 1993.

PCs would treat each parcel       of material as a document with all the stand-alone       capabilities of a Web page. Each of these documents       would have hyperlinks so that the creator of a document       could make it available for reading, listening or       viewing anywhere on the Web.       "This is going to make enormous changes possible," said       Jesse Berst, editor of Windows Watcher. "It's analogous       to the advent of the automobile." "We're moving into a       new world; we now have a new metaphor," said John Seely       Brown, director of the Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto       Research Center.       A potentially troublesome aspect to Microsoft's new       thrust is the extent to which it will further blur the       distinctions between data that sit safely on a person's       own computer and data flowing around the Internet. While       certain measures of privacy and security control are       built into Microsoft's current and planned software, it       is still working to develop better security for Internet       software.    -----        SHI_fty

7-23-96, WaPo:    "The Cryptography Wars." Op-Ed By Kenneth W. Dam and    Herbert S. Lin       In a June 10 editorial The Post disagreed with the NRC       report, suggesting that law enforcement and national       security interests require that current restrictions on       cryptography be maintained. The Post asserted that it is       "too soon" to accept that encryption can help law       enforcement and national security.       But arguing that it is premature to believe some uses of       encryption do benefit law enforcement and national       security simply denies reality. We emphatically reject       The Post's implication that we "sacrificed" law       enforcement and national security considerations in       favor of economic interests. Indeed, only a fully open       and inclusive public discussion can lead to the national       consensus upon which any successful cryptography policy       will depend.    -----      (6 kb)    DAM_lin

Sunday WaPo:    "Liquid Explosives, Miniature Timers May Foil Airline    Security Measures."       1994 spelled the beginning of what some experts fear       might be a resurgence of hi-tech terrorism, this time       involving persons with more advanced bomb-making skills       who know how to defeat even the best airport security       devices. The new terrorists favor smaller and much less       detectable plastic or liquid explosives detonated by       miniaturized and benign looking timers.        At the heart of such devices is a timer built by       rewiring a commonly available Casio digital watch, which       is connected to a stabilized form of liquid       nitroglycerin stored in a bottle ostensibly filled with       contact lens solution.

IP-layer security encompasses two functional areas:    authentication and privacy. The authentication mechanism    assures that a received packet was, in fact, transmitted by    the party identified as the source in the packet header and    that the packet was not altered in transit. The privacy    facility enables communicating nodes to encrypt messages to    prevent eavesdropping by third parties.    -----        IET_fws

7-25-96. The Associated Press:    Computer Codes May Aid Crime      Washington -- FBI Director Louis Freeh warned Congress on    Thursday that allowing uncontrolled export of U.S. computer    security codes may help international criminals and    terrorists hide their activities from law enforcement.    "Encryption products used unchecked by criminals and    terrorists for their illegal activities pose an extremely    serious and, I believe, unacceptable threat," Freeh told    the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.    Legislation pending in the Senate would permit U.S.    companies to export high-tech encryption devices that    ensure greater privacy for computer files, electronic mail    messages and systems such as stock exchange transactions.    Sponsors said the bill would "help America maintain our    superiority in software development" and guard against    unwarranted government intrusion.    "It is irrelevant that we can make a better product if we    cannot sell it," said Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., one of the    sponsors.    The Clinton administration has proposed that encryption    exports be allowed only if a decoding "key" for the devices    is left with a third party -- such as a bank or insurance    company -- so that law enforcement personnel with a court    order could break the code, if necessary.    Freeh said such an arrangement would safely open profitable    foreign markets for U.S. software companies. The Internet,    he said, "was never intended as a place without police    officers. We need cops there, as we do elsewhere, to    protect people, to guard their rights."    The encryption codes available today are so powerful, Freeh    said, that it would take the FBI more than a year to decode    a single message in some cases. Ramzi Yousef, on trial in    New York on charges of plotting to bomb a dozen U.S.    airliners, used a laptop computer containing files the FBI    still hasn't been able to decode, he added.    Sponsors and industry officials noted, however, that many    of these devices are already available abroad, and anyone    can download them free from the Internet. They can also be    sold within the United States at local computer stores.    "The criminal element the administration is trying to    prevent from obtaining this technology already has it,"    said Roel Pieper, president of Tandem Computers Inc. "The    only ones who suffer as a result of this policy is the U.S.    industry."    Netscape Communications Corp. President Jim Barksdale    estimated his company will lose $40 million this year in    potential export sales for encryption products.    But a top official at the National Security Agency -- whose    job is to break secret codes -- said the encryption "genie    is not out of the bottle." NSA Deputy Director William    Crowell said encryption won't be widely used until it is    marketed and sold, with support to help people use it.    "The administration's proposal is not designed to keep the    plug in the bottle, but to help provide a full range of    trusted security services," Crowell said.    Industry executives also said use of the decoding keys    would be costly and raises questions about government    access to private business and personal information, such    as bank and medical records.    "Keys can be compromised in many ways. They can be stolen,    revealed by disgruntled employees or obtained through    bribery, Pieper said.    -----

7-27-96. FiTi:    "Colossus faces rebirth into a world of dispute."       The man behind the resurrection of Colossus is Tony       Sale, a computer expert and former MI5 operative who       once worked for Peter Wright of "Spycatcher" fame. Its       reconstruction, now in its final weeks, is not merely an       act of homage to the mathematical supermen of Bletchley       who hastened the Allied victory over the Nazis. Neither       is it just a triumph over the official secrecy in which       the machine was cloaked until a few years ago. It is a       working demonstration of Sale's contention that Colossus       was the world's first computer.       So sophisticated was the machine intelligence at       Bletchley Park that the very existence of Colossus was       not revealed until 1970, according to Tony Sale. After       the war the government ordered 10 Colossi to be broken       up -- some say as part of an intelligence deal with the       Americans.       Gripped by a desire to assert the claims of Colossus,       the former MI5 man asked GCHQ to reinstate his security       clearance so he could work on the project. The parts       could be found in any British telephone exchange up to       the 1970s. Yet it took until 1992 to get all the       electronics declassified. Only last November was Sale       allowed to demonstrate the machine's ability to break       the Lorenz wheel settings. Even today members of the       public are forbidden to operate Colossus: some of its       codebreaking algorithms are still, it seems, a secret.    -----      (15 kb)    COL_oss

@_subject: WaPo on Crypto-Genie Terrorism 
The Washington Post, July 27, 1996, p. A22.    Speaking in Code on the Internet ... [Editorial]    The decibel level has been rising in the argument over how    much control the federal government should have over the    export of encryption technology. The Senate Commerce    Committee held hearings Thursday on a proposal dubbed    Pro-CODE (Promotion of Commerce On-line in the Digital Era)    that would lift current restrictions on exporting    encryption software above a certain level of complexity.    The move is opposed strongly by law enforcement and    national security authorities, who fear the consequences to    their tracking of terrorism or crime if uncrackable    cryptography becomes the global standard.    But encryption software -- which scrambles a person's    computer messages so no one can read them without a key --    also is thought by many in the computer industry to be the    missing piece that's preventing customers from a full-scale    move to the Internet for banking and other confidential    transactions, rather than, as now, worrying about the    security of their data. They also see it as a market in    which the United States maintains a comfortable lead, one    that is threatened if domestic encryption makers can't sell    their products elsewhere. The makers argue that foreign    encryption software will rush in to fill the gap, doing    nothing about the uncrackability problem -- indeed, making    it worse. The administration in turn is pursuing a wider    international agreement to maintain controls on cryptology    export by all the industrialized nations and has been    putting pressure on its colleagues in the Organization for    Economic Cooperation and Development, which will rule on    the matter in a Paris meeting in September.    Administration officials, including FBI chief Louis Freeh,    have been pushing for an alternative policy of "voluntary    key escrow" -- encryption makers would deposit a key to the    code with a neutral third body before exporting the    products and could then have access to the codes only by    court order, as happens now with wiretapping. Mr. Freeh,    testifying at Thursday's hearing in favor of an optional    key escrow plan, noted that the point is not to prevent all    copies of uncrackable code from going abroad --  that's    clearly impossible -- but to prevent such high-level code    from becoming the international standard, with architecture    and transmission channels all unreadable to world    authorities. To software companies and Internet users who    have been clamoring for the right to encrypt as securely as    possible, Mr. Freeh and others argue, "the genie is not yet    out of the bottle" on "robust," meaning uncrackable,    encryption.    It's far from obvious to anyone that an optional escrow    plan really can prevent the growth of inaccessible    transmissions by international terrorists or criminals.    Encryption, if widely used, could conceivably ease some    privacy problems concerning who gets to see personal and    financial data on individuals -- though such data usually    are vulnerable to being dug out of storage rather than    intercepted in transmission. But neither is it clear that    the encryption enthusiasts' desire for free development    should take precedence over the tracking of terrorism. At    the very least, Congress should be exceedingly cautious    about getting out ahead of administration concerns on    controls that, once lifted, are hardly reversible.    -----

@_subject: War of Words 
Financial Times, July 27/28, 1996, p. XVIII.    War of words over the facts    By Peter Aspden     It must be tough to return from a spell of duty as a war    correspondent to a gentle, civilised, country such as    Britain. One minute you are witnessing the most unspeakable    atrocities committed in the name of politics, religion or    just for the hell of it; the next, you are listening to    heated debate over the future of the rugby Five Nations    Championship. It does nothing for your sense of    perspective.    Martin Bell, who covered the Bosnian war with such    distinction for the BBC, left the stench of the Srebrenica    mass executions to breathe the irrelevant odours of    Euro-scepticism and National Lottery-mania over the media    airwaves. It shocked him to the core, as he revealed in a    recent speech: "I ask myself: is this my country? Is it    even my planet?"    Bell's exasperation has led him to question the model of    balanced, dispassionate, objective journalism which has    been the bedrock of BBC -- and indeed most serious    newspaper and broadcasting -- journalism. He now calls it    "bystander journalism". "What I believe in now is what I    prefer to call the journalism of attachment, a journalism    that cares as well as knows."    Predictably, this has set alarm bells ringing.    Traditionalists fussed over their hallowed dictum -- facts    are sacred, comment is free -- with scarcely a pause for    reflection. It is precisely when issues take on a tragic,    awful dimension, they argued, that one needs to stick to    the facts of the matter. There is no room for sentiment on    the front lines.    But Bell's point is well made. The trouble with facts, or    at least those which are given privilege by traditional    journalism, is that they are hard, cold, numbing. If, while    reporting on Srebrenica, one talks about diplomatic    initiatives, talks about talks, United Nations troop    movements, one soon loses one's audience.    It is a lesson which even academics, those ultimate    upholders of cool objectivity, have come to appreciate. I    remember the American philosopher Richard Rorty beginning    a lecture on human rights to Oxford University students    with a harrowing account of a Bosnian Moslem having his    penis bitten off. The atmosphere became electric, no mean    feat for the Sheldonian Theatre.    We probably would not hear of such incidents in a normal    news account from Bosnia; we certainly would not see    anything related to it, on grounds of poor taste. But the    sexual sadism which is a component of virtually every    ethnic cleansing campaign there has ever been is a fact,    too. Not a cold, hard fact, but one which has the power to    move people. Therein lies its strength.    It is not as if the media show any consistency here. On    certain occasions, they are only too willing to allow news    reports to emote. When we see an interview with a    distressed relative whose family has been wiped out or gone    missing, we are meant to feel for them. And the police    exploit that feeling: they hope that public compassion will    turn to solid leads. The facts here are heart-wrenching.    But, more importantly, they are facts with which we can    identify. It requires little imagination to see ourselves    in the wretched situation we watch on the small screen. We    know what it is like to lose a loved one, or we feel we    know. What we find difficult is to move from micro to    macro.    What happened at Srebrenica, like what happened at    Auschwitz and Belsen, is almost unimaginable. And faced    with the unimaginable, we go cold. This applies to news    reports as well as the self-defence mechanisms of our    fragile emotions. One cannot countenance sitting down after    dinner in front of the television to hear of such    brutalities, let alone see them.    But that is no excuse. The trouble with cold facts is that    they harden, while all the time we should be being    tenderised. And then we fall to that terrible disease of    fattened western sensibilities, "compassion fatigue".    We should listen to Martin Bell. He knows a thing or two    about human behaviour which most of us choose to exclude    from our worldview. We should have heard more from him on    the horrors of Bosnia, and less on the grotesquely    inadequate responses of our gentle, civilised countries as    they sought to respond to the unthinkable.

AmBank, July 29, 1996:       Technologists at banks with large overseas operations       have drawn encouragement from a National Research       Council report suggesting that businesses be allowed       stronger forms of data encryption. Although financial       transactions are generally exempt from encryption       restrictions, bankers advocate more freedom in the       market. They complain that government officials often       refuse their requests for international use of       applications with strong cryptography -- and give no       reasons for their decisions.    NiSaShi, July 23, 1996:       Japan ID Tech, an Osaka-based information technology       startup, has developed a system for encoding text as       graphical images that can be sent via fax over normal       communications transmission lines. The system consists       of software that converts text to a two-dimensional bar       code called a CP code, which is gaining popularity as a       next-generation coding system. The company's encoding       program also incorporates DES.

@_subject: Reuter on P8 Anti-Terrorism 
G7, Russia adopt anti-terror pact, avoid sanctions    Date: Tue, 30 Jul 1996 10:00:07 PDT    PARIS (Reuter) - The world's major powers closed ranks to     combat terrorism Tuesday, urging other nations to join    forces with them but sidestepping a dispute over U.S.    demands for sanctions against what Washington calls    "terrorist states."    Foreign and security ministers from the Group of Seven    industrial nations and Russia approved a list of 25    measures to defeat terrorists around the globe.    "We will not stop in this united effort until those    responsible are brought to justice," U.S. Attorney General    Janet Reno told a news conference after the five-hour    meeting of the so-called P8 nations -- P being for    political.    The package included pledges to reinforce police    cooperation and training, share intelligence, ease    extradition and legal assistance, dry up sources of funding    and weapons and strengthen national anti-terrorism    legislation.    The ministers also vowed to prevent extremists from using     the Internet computer network to plan attacks and spread     bomb-making instructions.    Participants heard Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy     recount how his 11-year-old son had shown him where to find    such content on the Internet.    French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said the meeting    had achieved its two objectives, "to adopt concrete    measures and to send a very clear signal to the    international community and to public opinion that the    leaders of the P8 are strongly determined to act    shoulder-to-shoulder, hand-in-hand."    Under-Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff said the U.S.    delegation had not raised President Clinton's contentious    call for "strong sanctions" against four states he says    support terrorism -- Iran, Iraq, Libya and Sudan.    France, Japan, Britain and Germany all made clear they    would not accept U.S. legislation to punish foreign firms    that dealt with such countries.    "We did not discuss country-specific cases ... We recognize     the fact that some of legislation passed in the United    States recently has encountered opposition among our    trading partners," Tarnoff said.    French Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre, who co-chaired     the meeting, said before it began: "The American analysis    is a bit simplistic and a bit outdated. If we look at the    phenomenon of terrorism today, we can see that it's more    complex."    He cited the bomb attack that killed two people and wounded     110 at the Atlanta Olympic Games last Saturday as evidence    of what he called "home-grown terrorism" without outside    help.    State-sponsored and extreme-left terrorism were largely a     thing of the past, and the international community now    faced two virulent new forms -- regionalist extremism and    religious militancy -- which did not have state support,    Debre said.    The United States offered extra proposals to tighten    airport security and mark explosives chemically so bombers    can be more easily traced, which the other countries    accepted.    Axworthy voiced widely shared alarm at the use of poison    gas in recent attacks in Japan, including on the Tokyo    subway.    "We are beginning to see terrifying signs of what the    future could hold if we don't take strong action.    Terrorists are now getting access to weapons of mass    destruction, chemical weapons, biological weapons, even    nuclear weapons," he said.    "It's (a threat) that really has a doomsday quality unless     we act now," he said.     The United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan    and Russia agreed that solving regional conflicts and    stabilizing crisis areas was the best way to tackle the    roots of terrorism.    "There must be no safe havens," German Foreign Minister    Klaus Kinkel said.    The ministers agreed their experts would hold follow-up    meetings to draft a new international convention to prevent    the abuse of political asylum to plan, fund or commit    terrorist acts and to coordinate security in public    transport.    Japan said it would hold an Asia-Pacific counter-terrorism     seminar by next June including Asian and Latin American    experts.    [End]

Excerpts of four reports on the G7+1 antiterrorism meet in    Paris:    WSJ:       + Mass Transport: The International Civil Aviation       Organization will implement new standards for bomb       detection at domestic and international airports. The       eight nations will jointly develop standards for more       detailed and accurate passenger and cargo lists, as well       as new vehicle-identification tagging methods to make       car-bombing investigations easier, U.S. officials said.       + Information Sharing: The U.S Federal Bureau of       Investigation will lead an effort to develop an       international forensic database. The FBI offered to       share certain computer records with the other seven       countries.       + Wiretapping and Internet: The eight countries said       they would develop new lawful means to intercept       communications among terrorists. They agreed to study       how to prevent the Internet from becoming a tool for       planning and executing terrorist events.       + Explosives Tracing: The U.S. will share its research       on new technologies to trace the origin of explosive       devices U.S. officials said, and will push for       international use of such technologies if they are found       to be workable.       + Other Measures: Controlling trade in certain weapons       and chemicals financing of terrorist organizations and       forgery of travel documents also will be studied.    WaPo:       The 25-point plan calls for close cooperation in       formulating a range of security measures, including       tightened controls on firearms and explosives;       prevention of terrorist communications on the Internet;       improved bomb detection methods at airports; and       interdiction of terrorist groups' financial resources.       They also called for the expediting of extradition       procedures and faster exchanges of information on       terrorist activities, including any use of chemical,       biological or nuclear materials. Details on all 25       points were left for law enforcement and forensic       experts to work out, with deadlines for finalization of       specific measures set for 90 days to six months.    FiTi:       Among the measures agreed in Paris were an accelerated       programme of research designed to find ways to mark       explosives so their origin could be identified after a       blast; the development of ways to prevent terrorists       using electronic or wire communication systems,       including the Internet and tougher sentences. The       ministers also called for investigations into       organisations with social, charitable and cultural goals       which were abused by terrorists; restrictions on asylum-       seeking by those who had committed attacks or were       suspected of planning or funding them; and more       effective border controls and extradition procedures.    NYP:       The details were not all made public today, but the       measures the officials agreed to draft included devising       methods to monitor terrorist attempts to communicate       over the Internet; developing standards to make it       easier to trace the origin of explosives used in       terrorist bombs and cracking down domestically on the       manufacture, sale, transport and export of explosives       and firearms. ----------    For extensive background, links to related sites and latest    information on the G7 series of meetings see:        ----------    For today's four full reports:       (20 kb for 4)    G7T_err

Two articles today in WSJ and FiTi show an unpected link between
geo-technology and geo-politics: One reviews the explosives sniffing technology invented by geologist
Anthony Barringer for global mineral exploration -- like copper, luxury
metals and oil -- but which came to have more practical utility in the
antiterrorist market (the company's stock is rocketing). Even so, its best
use may prove to be in discovering petroleum and other wealth of the earth.
As this tech becomes more widespread, Shell has good reason to encrypt its
geological logs and steganographize its governmental bribes. And, a column reviews the tie between nationalist conflicts (markets for
cheap explosives) and the invention of modern states (markets for expensive
munitions). How the citizenry of modern nations are united by "the need for
context-free communication" that was once limited to the members of the
"high culture" of pre-modern communities. And how the nationalist citizenry
are adopting the cheap versions of expensive munitions of the states' high
culture to get their overdue share of the earth's pie. It explores the

@_subject: NYT on NRC Report 
The New York Times, May 31, 1996, p. D2.    White House Challenged on Data Security    By John Markoff    The United States Government should immediately relax    export controls on electronic data coding products and    allow the computer, software and telecommunications    industries to set data security standards, a new report    urged yesterday.    The report, commissioned by Congress and prepared for the    National Research Council of the National Academy of    Sciences, stands in direct opposition to existing Clinton    Administration proposals for data security standards and    for linking the relaxation of export controls to the    adoption of such standards. The report calls for the    widespread commercial adoption of technologies used to    prevent illegal wiretapping of computer data, telephone,    cellular and other wireless communications. The National    Research Council provides science and technology advice    under a Congressional charter.    The report also states that despite creating potential    problems for law enforcement agencies by making it easier    for criminals to shield their communications from    Government wiretappers, cryptography would also help    prevent crime by sheltering communications and electronic    transactions from the prying eyes of electronic    interlopers.    "Without information security, computer crime in this    country will rise very rapidly," said Kenneth W. Dam, the    chairman of the panel that prepared the report. Mr. Dam,    Deputy Secretary of State during the Reagan Administration,    is also professor of American and foreign law at the    University of Chicago.    The report, industry executives said, is likely to become    a key weapon in the battle between the Federal Government    and industry and civil liberties groups.    "It echoes things we have been saying for some time," said    Jim Bidzos, chief executive of RSA Data Security Inc., a    developer of computer security software. "The next    battleground is going to be Capitol Hill because the    Administration isn't going to give up easily."    In particular, the report takes issue with Administration    efforts to force the use of data-scrambling systems using    "escrowed" keys that would let law enforcement and    intelligence agencies use built-in backdoors to read coded    information.    Cryptography, once used only by spies and the military, has    become an increasingly vital technology for insuring    security in electronic commerce and personal privacy. It    relies on the use of mathematical formulas to scramble    electronic information so that it cannot be read without    the proper digital "key."    Key escrow systems like those proposed by the    Administration in its Clipper chip program would split the    key and have trusted third parties like the Treasury    Department hold parts of it, making it possible for law    enforcement agencies to generate keys without consulting    the sources of the data.    As recently as two weeks ago, the Administration was    pushing for key escrow coding approaches to data    scrambling. A draft White.House policy paper has proposed    linking relaxation of export controls to systems that    included key escrowing. The recent paper also indicated    that the Government was willing to accept "self-escrow"    systems for some large corporations that would allow them    to to hold all parts of the keys.    Critics of key escrow management technology note that it    can be abused by agencies that wish to exceed their    surveillance authority and that the technology is    vulnerable to a single point of failure. If a so-called    master key is stolen, they say, the entire coding system    can be compromised.    Because strong cryptography would complicate the mission of    United States intelligence agencies, the Federal Government    currently places tight controls on the export of software    and hardware that offer stronger cryptographic protection    than 40-bit keys. Such keys are made up of a binary number    that is 40 digits long. Computer experts have shown that    40-bit keys are vulnerable to attacks.    The report released yesterday, "Cryptography's Role in    Securing the Information Society," calls for dropping stiff    export controls on products that use the Data Encryption    Standard, which relies on a 56-bit key and offers stronger    protection against computerized attacks than a 40-bit key.

Netscape (WSJ) and PRZ (Globe) say the NRC crypto    export recommendations don't go far enough.    ----------    Wall Street Journal, May 31, 1996, p. B5.    U.S. Strategy Should Promote Computer Codes       Panel Says a Free Market Is Best Policy, Urges Easing of       Export Curbs    By John J. Fialka    Washington -- The federal government should promote rather    than discourage widespread commercial use of powerful codes    that can protect electronic communications, a panel    sponsored by the National Research Council recommended.    The government also should relax its export controls on    such codes, according to the 16-member panel, which    included a mix of business, academic and government    experts. The NRC is an affiliate of the National Academy of    Sciences, a private, nonprofit organization that advises    the government on scientific matters.    Encryption coding software scrambles computer data by using    mathematical formulas that can't be read if intercepted.    Only personnel with the correct "keys" can access the data.    More Study Needed    The NRC study, which took 18 months to complete, calls for    greater trust in freemarket demands for protection and less    reliance on the U.S. National Security Agency and the    Federal Bureau of Investigation to set the nation's code    policy. It said the two agencies' recent promotion of    "escrowed encryption," in which the government would hold    a mathematical key to unlock codes, requires further study    because it poses liability risks and introduces weakness    into information protection systems.    Kenneth W. Dam, a University of Chicago law professor who    headed the panel, said changes are needed to counter "an    explosion of computer-based crime" and other forms of    espionage that threaten U.S. companies' ability to protect    proprietary information, especially overseas.    By promoting the use of more-elaborate codes, U.S.    law-enforcement agencies would be better prepared to ward    off hacker or terrorist attacks on the nation's electric    power grid, banking and telecommunications systems and its    air-traffic control networks, he added.    Potential Problems    Mr Dam said the widespread use of encryption by private    business is "inevitable" and the government must "recognize    this changing reality."    The report noted that the FBI has argued for years that its    law-enforcement efforts would be hampered if drug cartels    and other organized criminals began using codes that    couldn't be deciphered. Courtordered wiretaps, a major tool    used to break organized-crime cases, could become useless,    the FBI has contended.    Edward Schmults, general counsel for GTE Corp. and a former    deputy attorney general during the Reagan administration,    said he and other panel members believe the FBI and other    law-enforcement agencies would be helped more than hurt if    legitimate businesses were better protected. "It's a    balancing issue," he said.    Spokesmen for the FBI and NSA referred questions to the    White House, where an official said the Clinton    administration disagrees with the panel's recommendation to    relax export controls and wants to continue to explore the    use of escrows by private industry to keep the keys to    powerful codes. "We have equities to protect that the    people who wrote the NRC report do not," he said.    The administration, he said, still wants to review the    export of more powerful codes on a case-by-case basis. The    use of private, third-party escrows, he said, might be one    way to protect the secrecy of companies while allowing    federal agents with court orders access to code keys.    New Markets Would Open    The panel called for the U.S. to permit the export of codes    containing a "56-bit" Data Encryption Standard algorithm.    The algorithm, or formula, was developed by the National    Bureau of Standards in 1975 and is 65,000 times tougher to    break than current "40-bit" codes that are permitted for    unlicensed exports.    The panel estimated its recommendations would open up new    markets for information security products, possibly    increasing software-industry revenue "many tens of billions    of dollars." Until now, export controls tended to set    industry standards for a level of protection because    companies were reluctant to use different systems for    domestic and international applications.    Jeffrey Treuhaft, director of security at Internet software    giant Netscape Communications Corp., welcomed the report,    but said exports shouldn't be limited to 56-bit keys. That    would still blunt the competitive edge of U.S. software    vendors, given that code-cracking computer power is    multiplying, he said.    "The U.S. has a lead right now and these arcane policies    from the Cold War are giving U.S. industry cement shoes to    compete with foreign competitors," Mr. Treuhaft said. "We    can't run as fast as they ean."    - Jared Sandberg in New York contributed to this article.    [End] ----------    The Boston Globe, May 31, 1996, p. 36    Panel criticizes US government's encryption stand       'Net, cell phone security at stake, National Research       Center says    By Hiawatha Bray    The Clinton administration's efforts to limit the sale of    software that generates coded messages, already unfire from    Congress and civil libertarians, is now facing criticism    from a committee of the National Academy Sciences.    The National Research Center, which gives science and    technology advice under a congressional charter, yesterday    said the government should promote the commercial use of    encryption software to help cut down on the theft of    computer data and other electronic communications.    Law enforcement officials and intelligence agencies are    worried about the development of cheap encryption grams,    for fear it could become impossible to intercept a    mobster's telephone call or read an enemy spy's electronic    mail messages.    But the center's report says that encryption software is    essential for businesses and individuals who need to    transmit confidential data using the Internet or cellular    telephones.    "On balance, the advantages of more widespread use of    cryptography outweigh the disadvantages," the report says.    Encrypted messages can easily be read by someone with the    correct code "key." Without this key, it can take centuries    of computer analysis to decode a message. The longer the    key, the tougher it is to break the code.    Under current federal law, US companies cannot export    encryption programs that use keys longer than 40 bits.    Computer experts say that 40-bit encryption systems are    easy to break, and provide little security.    As a result, many software companies that sell their    products worldwide do not build in sophisticated encryption    features. Industry experts say that this costs them    millions of dollars in sales, as customers in foreign    countries buy encryption software made outside the United    States.    The report urges a change in the federal law, to allow sale    of an encryption system called DES that uses 56-bit keys.    "Except in some very specialized situations, it gives    adequate security," said council chairman Kenneth Dam, a    law professor at the University of Chicago.    The report also urges the administration to abandon efforts    to force businesses and individuals to use "key escrowed"    encryption software. Under this plan, companies could use    encryption, keys of any length, but only if the keys were    held in escrow, and could be made available to the    government.    The council urges the federal government to adopt key    escrow to prove that the system is trustworthy. The report    argues that many businesses will voluntarily adopt such a    plan to guard against the loss of its encryption keys.    A prominent critic of encryption policy was less than    thrilled by-the council report. "It doesn't go far enough,"    said Philip Zimmermann, inventor of the Pretty Good Privacy    encryption program.    Zimmermann scoffed at the idea that DES encryption is    secure enough for use by businesses. "It can be broken in    seconds by the NSA [National Security Agency]," Zimmermann    said. "All major governments can break DES. In fact, any    Fortune 500 company can afford a machine that can break    DES."    But even if DES were secure enough, Zimmermann said he    opposes any restrictions on the export of encryption    software.    [End]

This is the article Winn Schwartau cited to last night: ----------    The Sunday Times (London), June 2, 1996, pp. 1, 24.    City surrenders to L400m gangs [Insight column]    City of London financial institutions have paid huge sums    to international gangs of sophisticated "cyber terrorists"    who have amassed up to L400m worldwide by threatening to    wipe out computer systems.    Banks, broking firms and investment houses in America have    also secretly paid ransom to prevent costly computer    meltdown and a collapse in confidence among their    customers, according to sources in Whitehall and    Washington.    An Insight investigation has established that British and    American agencies are examining more than 40 "attacks" on    financial institutions in London and New York since 1993.    Victims have paid up to L13m a time after the blackmailers    demonstrated their ability to bnng trading to a halt using    advanced "information warfare" techniques learnt from the    military.    According to the American National Security Agency (NSA),    they have penetrated computer systems using "logic bombs"    (coded devices that can be remotely detonated),    electromagnetic pulses and "high emission radio frequency    guns", which blow a devastating electronic "wind" through    a computer system.    They have also left encrypted threats at the highest    security levels, reading: "Now do you believe we can    destroy your computers?"    The authorities have been unable to stem the attacks, which    are thought to onginate from the United States. In most    cases, victim banks have failed to notify the police. "They    have given in to blackmail rather than risk a collapse in    confidence in their security systems," said a security    director at one blue-chip merchant bank in the City.    A senior detective in the City of London police said: "We    are aware of the extortion methods, but the banking    community has ways of dealing with it and rarely reports to    the police."    European and American police forces have set up special    units to tackle the cyber criminals, who, Ministry of    Defence sources believe, have netted between L200m and    L400m globally over the past three years. But law    enforcement agencies complain that senior financiers have    closed ranks and are hindering inquiries.    Experts in the field of information warfare met in Brussels    last month to discuss defensive measures. Representatives    included Captain Patrick Tyrrell, assistant director of    computer information strategy at the Ministry of Defence;    General James McCarthy, professor of national security at    the US Air Force Academy; General Jean Pichot-Duclos,    director of the economic intelligence department of the    French Defence Council, and senior figures from the    civilian computer industries.    A separate closed meeting involving representatives from    Whitehall and the intelligence community was held to    analyse the 40 attacks on British and American financial    centres since 1993. A further secret seminar took place in    Washington this weekend.    Kroll Associates, the international investigating firm,    confirmed last week that it had acted for financial    institutions that have been blackmailed. "One of the    problems we face is that the potential embarrassment from    loss of face is very senous," said a spokesman in New York.    Kroll had evidence that firms in London and New York had    been targeted. "The problem for law enforcement is that the    crime is carried out globally, but law enforcement stops at    the frontier," he said.    Yesterday a Bank of England spokesman acknowleged the    threat from the extortionists: "We are aware of this. It    does exist. It is extortion and fraud." But the spokesman    also insisted: "It is not the biggest issue in the banking    market."    Scotland Yard is now taking part in a Europe-wide    initiative to catch the cyber criminals and has appointed    a senior detective from its computer crime unit to take    part in an operation codenamed Lathe Gambit. Such is the    secrecy that few details about the inquiry have emerged.    In America, the FBI has set up three separate units to    investigate computer extortion.    The NSA believes there are four cyber gangs and has    evidence that at least one is based in Russia. The agency    is now examining four examples of blackmail said to have    occurred in London:    + January 6, 1993: Trading halted at a broking house after    blackmail threat and computer crash. Ransom of L10m paid to    account in Zurich.    + January 14, 1993: a blue-chip bank paid L12.5m after    blackmail threats.    + January 29, 1993: a broking house paid L10m in ransom    after similar threats.    + March 17, 1995: a defence firm paid L10m in ransom.    In all four incidents, the gangs made threats to senior    directors and demonstrated that they had the capacity to    crash a computer system. Each victim conceded to the    blackmailers' demands within hours and tranferred the money    to offshore bank accounts, from which it was removed by the    gangs within minutes.    The techniques have varied. In London, criminals posing as    marketing firms have gained detailed knowledge of a    target's system by interviewing the heads of information    technology departments. In some cases, they have even    issued questionnaires to unsuspecting officials. Armed with    this information, they have been able to breach security    and leave encrypted messages warning of their capability.    The gangs are believed to have gained expertise in    information warfare techniques from the American military,    which is developing "weapons" that can disable or destroy    computer hardware. Some are also known to have infiltrated    banks simply by placing saboteurs on their payroll as    temporary staff.    Little is yet known about the identities of the gangs but,    according to the NSA, America is the main source of the    attacks. It believes that at least one other group    originates from Russia and has followed the movement of    money to the former Soviet states.    A spokesman for the Metropoiitan poiice said: "There is    potential for extortion from those purporting to know how    to damage computer systems.    "The computer crime unit liaises where necessary with its    Euro counterparts to discuss cross-frontier crimes."    One merchant bank director said yesterday: "You will never    get a financial institution to admit it has an extortion    policy, let alone that it has paid money to blackmailers."    -----    Additional reporting: Peter Warren    [End]

@_subject: NRC Session Hiss 
During the Q&A of the NRC public session, it was asked why    56-bit DES was selected as the standard of export over    other widely distributed programs such as PGP.    The panelists seemed to me uneasy in answering this.    Primarily their view was that DES was "ubquitious," well-    known and tested by use.    However, when pressed by later questioners on this topic,    they expanded their view: that if another, stronger,    program became "ubiquitous" -- in wide use -- they would    support it as the standard of export. When it was pointed    out that PGP now fit this definition, the panel merely    repeated the statement about ubiquity without specifically    affirming or denying the PGP claim. Their poker faces    seemed uniformly in place to dampen a potential    inflammatory topic.    Perhaps other attendees will amplify this odd demeanor, but    it seems to me that the panel was attempting to avoid    commenting one way or the other on PGP's worldwide ubiquity    for unstated reasons.    I wonder if this was a nudge to the audience that the    informal spread of unapproved encryption is the best way to    establish its ubiquity and thereby to set a new standard    for export, sort of under the noses of the authorities --    as if PGP was exemplary.    Recall that this fits the Clinton administration's way of    getting around the Croatian arms embargo -- the "no    position" position of sidestepping legality.    Also, I wonder if the panel wants avoid an open conflict    with the administration, the LEAs and the security agencies    about PGP. (Or do they know something about PGP that we    don't know, or have been led to think they do?)    Peter Neumann had pointed out earlier that crypto was going    to be ubiquitous, and fairly soon, no matter what. He noted    that it is the NRC's recommendation that LEAs take the    "long-term, pro-active" view about this and get on with    developing other technologies, and training personnel in    them, to fight computer crime -- like traffic analysis,    packet trace, etc. -- and to accept that prohibiting and    cracking crypto is not effective. (This may have been    diversionary, but he seemed sincere.)    Perhaps the panel is agreeing the crypto genie is out of    the bottle, and are advising the authorities to recognize    that stronger and stronger crypto is going to become    ubiquitous, and it's time to move on to other, presumably    less ubiquitious, cyber-crime fighting technolgies.    Perhaps the committee was briefed on these technolgies, or    maybe some members are even developing them -- Mr. Neumann,    for example, in conjunction with Ms. Denning, et al.    Those who plan to attend the June 6 session might want to    pursue the "no position" position about PGP's ubiquity, and    why. Diversionary sop, say, to cover the promotion of non-    crypto invasion of privacy.    Further, it would be helpful to learn more about what the    the committee members were told about "long-term" cyber-    surveillance technologies in the pipeline.    What bothered me more than anything else about the session    was that individual privacy got such short shrift by    panelists and by the audience.  While there was a bit of    discussion on personal privacy protection, government and    business, and their mutual back-scratching, seemed to the    the primary focus.    Pretty Lousy Privacy appears to be in the works, judging    from what was not disclosed in the session (and in the    report) about two 800-pounders working in concert at    citizen data gathering, mining, selling, controlling,    dominating -- at the expense of individual privacy, and,    shout it, liberty.    Peter Neumann got to me when he described the "downside" of    anonymity, encryption and security: how can we know who are    the criminals if we don't for sure who is who and know for    sure who is doing what? Not a single panelist disagreed    with his statement about this, but then I heard only a few    snorts from the criminal-fraught-fed audience.    I kept mum. Jesus, who knows who was recording every    titter and hiss -- besides anonymous beside me and me.

Tomorrow, the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of       Consumer Protection is sponsoring a public workshop in       Washington called "Consumer Privacy on the Global       Information Infrastructure." The F.T.C.'s intention is       to find out how much consumers and the industry really       know about critical privacy issues created by what it       calls "the emerging on-line marketplace," and to look at       various ways to protect personal data.       Privacy on data networks is a complex issue.

Newsweek, June 10, 1996, pp. 49-55.    Scared Bitless       The arcane world of cryptography used to be the       exclusive realm of spies. Now it's everybody's business       -- to the chagrin of the government.    By Steven Levy       [Photo] Loosen up: Sen. Conrad Burns says the United       States should ease the export rules on crypto software    On the face of it, the issue of cryptography -- the    technology that employs secret codes to protect information    -- seems more suited to math class than "The McLaughlin    Group." Yet this once esoteric subject has wound up in the    center of a Beltway controversy, complete with    congressional infighting, lobbyists, entrenched government    agencies, blue-ribbon reports and even a bit of    presidential politics. This sudden spotlight on what was    previously the domain of deep-black spy stuff turns out to    be a good thing, because in the Information Age crypto    policy is more than an abstraction: it could provide the    difference between security and vulnerability, or even    between life and death. Unfortunately, choosing the right    policy is not a given, and there the controversy lies.    Here's the problem: we're increasingly entrusting    information to computers -- everything from confidential    medical records to business plans to money itself. But how    can we provide security so that these data will be    protected from eavesdroppers, thieves and saboteurs? The    answer hinges on cryptography. By scrambling the    information into digital codes, it allows only those    entrusted with the keys to decipher those files to see    them. Some hot-shot cryptographers have developed systems    that can provide all of us with unprecedented security,    automatically coding and decoding in such a way that we    won't have to know it's there. (We can even have our phone    calls encoded something Prince Charles might have    appreciated.) Silicon Valley would love to set such a    system in motion. It not only would generate revenues, but    would also address the main problem that's keeping the    Internet from fulfilling its potential as a center of    commerce: security.    Problem solved? Not quite. Law-enforcement and    national-security agencies view this prospect with dread.    Legal eavesdroppers, like FBI wiretappers and National    Security Agency snoopers, couldn't make sense of    intercepted transmissions. They warn that we could miss    indications of a terrorist act, like a nuke smuggled into    Manhattan. In addition, drug dealers, child pornographers    and garden-variety thugs could mask their activities with    a mere mouse click.    Even before the Clinton administration took office, the NSA    and FBI presented those nightmare scenarios to the    transition team. The Clintonites were scared bitless. They    vowed to make sure that the worst didn't happen. They    understood that cryptography should be put to general use    -- but only if it were altered in such a way that the    government could, if necessary, get access to secret    messages, using a new technology known as "key escrow." The    best-known of those schemes was the ill-fated Clipper Chip,    and subsequent systems haven't caught on. (Yet another was    presented two weeks ago.) Until then they would maintain    the strict export controls that treat crypto software as    powerful munitions. That's right -- Uncle Sam regards that    copy of Netscape you downloaded as sort of a Stinger    missile.    But now the government position of slowing down the flow of    crypto is under increasing attack. Software companies    complain that regulations cost them money and hold down    innovation. Privacy groups complain that the controls reek    of Orwell's "1984." Congress is demanding changes. Bob Dole    wants to make it an issue. And on Thursday came what Sen.    Conrad Burns, a Montana Republican, called "the nail in the    coffin" of the Clinton crypto policy: a report by the    National Research Council that clearly rebukes the    administration's position. Despite the Clinton-Gore attempt    to protect us against the abuse of cryptography, says the    Congress-commissioned report, our safety is at risk --    because the lack of cryptography has weakened our security.    Under particular attack are the regulations that limit the    strength of exported software like IBM's Lotus Notes,    mostly by mandating that the keys that encode and decipher    the information not exceed 40 bits (the longer the key, the    stronger the protection). Often, domestic users have to    settle for this crippled crypto: since software companies    are loath to release two versions of their products, they    simply choose to offer the weaker, approved-for-export    version.    Meanwhile, foreign companies have no such restrictions, and    U.S. companies maintain they are losing sales. Congress has    taken up their case; bills introduced by Sen. Patrick    Leahy, Rep. Bob Goodlatte and Burns all would relax the    export rules. "These bills are pro-privacy, pro-jobs and    pro-business," says Leahy. While prospects for passage are    slim, the fact that a sizable number of legislators are    defying intelligence and law-enforcement agencies is itself    significant.    Crypto policy is even finding its way into the presidential    campaign. On a visit to Silicon Valley, Bob Dole was    alerted to the problem by Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale. He    also saw a chance to chip away at Clinton's support in the    high-tech world. Dole not only cosponsored the Senate bills    but issued a neo-cypherpunk statement charging that "the    administration's big brother proposal will literally    destroy America's computer industry."    The NRC report, entitled "Cryptography's Role in Securing    the Information Society," stands as the most serious    challenge to current policy. It is drenched in credibility:    its 16 authors include former attorney general Benjamin    Civiletti, onetime NSA deputy director Ann Caracristi,    privacy expert Willis Ware and cryptographer Martin    Hellman. The panel was briefed by all sides of the issue,    including some classified sessions with government    officials. Despite the group's diversity, it reached    consensus: "Widespread commercial and private use of    cryptography is inevitable in the long run and ... its    advantages, on balance, outweigh its disadvantages."    The NRC made some specific recommendations. The government    should stop building a system around the umproven    Clipper-style technology. The export regulations should be    relaxed, specifically permitting free export of the    well-tested Data Encryption Standard, which uses a 56-bit    key. (While some argue for even bigger keys, this is a    significant jump. The increase in key size alone means that    theoretically it will be more than 65,000 times harder to    crack a code.) Perhaps the strongest rebuke came with the    rejection of the "if you only knew" defense. The committee    concluded that informed decisions on crypto could be made    without access to classified material.    If the NRC advice was followed, would criminals hide    nefarious activities behind a digital wall of gibberish?    Quite possibly, admits the committee -- but without action    to promote crypto, we are increasingly dependent on a    computer-controlled world with insufficient protection.    "We're encouraging a world that supports greater    confidentiality -- but we think it's worth the risk," says    panelist Ray Ozzie, creator of IBM's Lotus Notes. The    committee cited security breaches like the recent raid on    Citicorp by Russian hackers, and warned that without    crypto, we are more vulnerable to "information warfare"    threats -- endangering operations like the    air-traffic-control system.    The government's response? "We do care about the security    of information, but we need to do it in a way that does not    diminish law enforcement," says an administration official.    "People writing academic reports can take chances. But when    you are the policeman, you have to err on the side of    protecting people."    The question is, which approach provides the most    protection? The NRC report undercuts the government's    position at a time when many were already beginning to    question it. On May 21, 11 senators sat down in a bugproof    room for a classified briefing, presumably designed to make    them rethink their proposals. But, said Leahy, "no one    seemed to change their mind." Looks like they've cracked    the code.    [Two photos] 'Pro-privacy, pro-jobs, pro-business': Sen.

Connecting Declan's three dots [...]:    The New York Times, June 4, 1996, pp. D1, D4.    Japanese Chips May Scramble U.S. Export Ban    By John Markoff    Washington, June 3 -- The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone    Corporation has quietly begun selling a powerful data-    scrambling chip set that is likely to undermine the Clinton    Administration's efforts to restrict the export of the    fundamental technology for protecting secrets and commerce    in the information age.    The existence of the two-chip set, which will have broad    potential application for local computer networks, the    Internet and telephone switching networks, was disclosed    here in a speech today at a public policy workshop by the    chief executive of RSA Data Security, a Silicon    Valley-based company that has frequently dueled with the    Administration over its export-control policies.    The executive, Jim Bidzos, said that his company was    negotiating with N.T.T., the giant telecommunications    concern, to resell the chips in the United States. Mr.    Bidzos also said that N.T.T. had already made sales in 15    countries, including in the United States to I.B.M.    "N.T.T. has done a lot of research and development work on    this product" he said. "There is clearly going to be a lot    of demand for their chips."    An executive at NTT America said that although there were    no restrictions on the export of cryptographic hardware or    software from Japan, his company was still anxious to    obtain software from RSA Data to use in its chips. That    software is still controlled by United States export law,    he said.    "We'd like to use this technology," said Junichi Kishigami,    director of NTT America, which is based in Mountain View,    Calif. "It is important to employ good international    standards."    Mr. Bidzos has been a vocal and longtime opponent of United    States export laws that prohibit the sale, without a    special license, of products that have powerful    data-scrambling capabilities. The Government's policy is    directed at limiting the spread of systems that could make    it more difficult for American intelligence and    law-enforcement agencies to conduct electronic    surveillance.    Such restrictions have been bitterly opposed in recent    years by American computer and telecommunications    companies; they have argued that the technology is already    widely available internationally and that manufacturers and    software developers in the United States are in danger of    losing markets to foreign competitors. The N.T.T.    technology would seem to support those contentions.    "The United States export controls are at risk from    Japanese competition," said Stewart Baker, a Washington    lawyer who is the former general counsel for the National    Security Agency.    The N.T.T. device also underscores fundamental differences    that exist between Japan and the United States on the issue    of privacy in the information age.    While United States officials have struggled to maintain    their ability to conduct electronic surveillance, Article    21 of Japan's Constitution specifically forbids    wiretapping.    "It's very interesting that the Japanese regard for privacy    in their Constitution translates into better cryptographic    technology," said Marc Rotenberg, director of the    Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington public    policy group and an organizer of today's workshop on data    scrambling.    Mr. Bidzos said that N.T.T.'s chips, which have been    developed and manufactured by a subsidiary, N.T.T.    Electronic Labs, were far more powerful than the so-called    Clipper chip, a data-scrambling system that the Clinton    Administration proposed for the nation's telephone system.    While the Clipper system has a built-in "back door"    intended to permit the F.B.I. to gain wiretap information,    the N.T.T. system has no such surveillance feature, It also    uses much stronger data-encryption algorithms than United    States export laws permit.    Those laws restrict the export of encryption systems which    employ digital "keys" of more than 40 bits in length. The    new N.T.T chips, however, are based on the United States    data encryption standard, which has a 56-bit key, and    actually triples the strength of that standard. Such a    scrambling system is believed to be beyond the capability    of the most powerful code-breaking system.    In addition to the "private" key system for scrambling    data, N.T.T. uses RSA Data's "public" key method to permit    computer users who have not previously exchanged    information to swap-private key information safely. The    N.T.T. system uses the RSA Data key, which is 1,024 bits in    length, also far stronger than the United States export    regulations permit.    "If there is anyone in the Government who hasn't already    seen the writing on the wall, here it is," Mr. Bidzos said.    He said that RSA Data had set up a small subsidiary in    Japan last year and that he was now negotiating with N.T.T.    to make a minority investment in that subsidiary in    exchange for N.T.T.'s gaining access to the RSA Data public    key technology.    The N.T.T. technology is at least partly the result of an    initiative by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and    Industry, which 18 months ago made a $120 million national    commitment to develop products to facilitate electronic    commerce.    "This is a major business opportunity that the Japanese see    clearly," said Deborah Hurley, an official at the    Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the    Paris-based international group.    RSA Data was acquired in April by Security Dynamics    Technologies Inc., a computer security company based in    Cambridge, Mass., in a stock deal valued at $250 million.    Mr. Bidzos said that the two companies had continued to    operate relatively independently.    [End]

@_subject: (Fwd) Crypto conference 
I was at EPIC's annual crypto conference yesterday, and just thought I'd pass along my impressions. It was, as always, extremely interesting; EPIC does a terrific job at these things of getting a very diverse and
thoughtful collection of people with interests in crypto policy into the room
together, everyone from Whit Diffie and Phil Zimmermann and Eric Hughes to Scott Charney of DOJ and Bruce McConnell of the White House, people from the OECD
and the hardware/software community, etc. There were panels on key escrow, digital cash, international developments, and the Karn/Bernstein cases and other domestic policy developments.  To
me, the most striking feature of the event was what I felt was a new bite to
the complaints about export controls.  People have been complaining, needless
to say, about these for a while -- but the *economic* case for lifting
controls is now in the forefront of the discussion in a way that was not the case before, imho.  Indeed, there wasn't an enormous amount of talk about the *privacy* implications of encryption this time at all.  Jim Bidzos of RSA gave a very powerful talk at lunch, at which he unveiled two chips that are
now being mass produced by Nippon Telephone, one incorporating the Triple-DES algorithm, and one with the RSA public key algorithm.  Someone else pointed to a recent story in the Economist, which listed the leading encryption software/services companies worldwide, each of which is Israeli.
Bidzos made the claim, and many others echoed, that the export controls are
in the process of doing nothing more than ceding a potentially lucrative market to others, a market in which the US might otherwise be expected to
be the dominant player.  It may even, in the eyes of some, be too late to undo
this damage. Now, some of this may be exaggerated, special interest whining.  But there's an interesting hook here.  Many have talked about the importance of
control over "standards " in network industries, the importance of
obtaining an early dominant position in the market that can appropriate all of the network externalities waiting to be plucked out there.  [Mark Lemley has an
interesting discussion of this in a piece on antitrust on the Net -- Mark, is that out anywhere yet?]  Acting quickly to penetrate the market becomes critical, not just because markets change on "Internet Time," but also because the early entrants have a chance of establishing themselves as de facto standards and thereby extending their dominance over time.  This, one
can plausibly argue, is what is happening -- has happened? -- in this market.  It is more credible in these kinds of markets to argue, as Bidzos was arguing, that if government policymakers wait until there's actual evidence of damage, of "lost market share," to US companies, that it will
at that point already be too late to do anything about the damage. ---------- [Second Cyberia-L message by David Post] One other interesting issue generated heated discussion -- as in yelling
and screaming between audience and panel -- at the EPIC conference.  Scott Charney of DOJ, who heads the US delegation to the OECD crypto guidelines conference, was subjected to pretty heated questioning about the
possibility that the US is trying to use the international forum as a way to move a particular policy agenda that is *not* being successfully peddled at home, and then to use the international support as a means of moving the domestic
policy debate in that direction.  Jamie Boyle of AU was particularly eloquent about this concern (I raised it too, less eloquently) -- I think
it fair to say that both of us had the copyright experience in the back of our
minds, where, many of us believe, the US has been pushing the "Lehman agenda" in international discussions as a way of presenting Congress with a
kind of fait accompli.  Charney vigorously denied that this was going on --
he strongly argued that since the OECD guidelines are non-binding (unlike, say, the treaty obligations being discussed in the copyright context), there's simply nothing wrong with discussing these clearly global issues with our international partners. It was, as they say in the press, a spirited exchange. David ********************************* David G.

The administration is expected to announce later this month    formation of:    + An emergency response task force, directed by the FBI and    based in the Justice Department, to manage any terrorist    incident involving an attack in cyberspace.    The Cyber Security Assurance Group would funcaon as both an    emergency response team and investigative body. It will    respond to any collapse of the National Information    Infrastructure -- the nation's vital computer systems such    as banking, transportation and telecommunications.    "The threat is there, it's very real," says CIA General    Counsel Jeffrey Smith.

The commission faces difficulty in balancing government    inter-agency turf battles as well as dealing with industry    and the private sector, which oppose Internet regulation.    "This is one of the toughest issues government faces    today," says Smith.    The initiatives have emerged from an unprecedented, closely    guarded series of meeangs held in recent months between    leading administration officials from law enforcement,    national security and defense.    Attorney General Janet Reno, acting under a classified    presidential directive issued late last year in response to    the Oklahoma City bombing, chairs the panel.    It includes the directors of the CIA and FBI along with    Cabinet secretaries from Treasury, Commerce, Transportation    and Energy.    Today, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations    holds the second in a series of hearings examining    cyberspace security and threats to information systems.    The panel's minority staff is expected to endorse    administration proposals to clearly draw national policy on    information security but calls for a more ambitious    emergency response effort by government.

The Economist, June 8, 1996, p. 65.    Encryption    Silence of the bugs    Spare a thought for America's professional snoops. For    decades the FBI and others have counted the telephone    wiretap among their favourite weapons against crime, as    countless mafiosi can (and did) testify. Now, software in    a computer or digital telephone can scramble a message so    effectively that no law-enforcement agency can read it. For    years, the government has fought back by restricting the    use of encryption, to the fury of privacy advocates on the    Internet, where rampant eavesdropping makes encryption    essential. Now a bit of silicon and a stack of paper have    apparently ended the battle: the cops lost.    The bit of silicon is actually two chips that can encrypt    data transmissions so that they are in effect uncrackable.    Had the chips been developed in the United States, the    government would have classified them as "munitions" and    banned their export. But they were developed in Japan, by    NTT, the telephone giant, and the Japanese subsidiary of    RSA, an American encryption company, which revealed their    existence early this week. They can therefore be used    around the world, and even imported into the United States.    There seems nothing the American government can do about    it.    As if that were not bad enough, America's restrictive    encryption policy took another hit last week when a report,    commissioned by Congress and compiled by the prestigious    National Research Council (NRC), concluded that the policy    had hurt Americans far more than it had helped them. For    the past few years, the White House has been offering a    purported compromise: give the government (or a mutually    trusted third party) a key to read your encrypted e-mail,    and you can scramble it all you like. The problem with this    so-called "key escrow" proposal was that it smacked to many    of Big Brotherism. The computer industry rejected it out of    hand, and fell back instead on weaker encryption that was    not regulated, even though this can be cracked over a    weekend with a home PC.    Up to now, the government's response to cries for better    encryption for all has been to fall back on its    responsibility to protect the citizenry. The NRC panel    rejected this, together with the "if only you knew what we    know" argument the government has usually trotted out.    Composed of former security officials and encryption    experts, this panel did know what the government knows, and    was still not convinced.    Now the NTT chips seem to sweep away the whole debate. NTT    has already sold the chips in 15 countries, and they should    soon be incorporated in products. Stewart Baker, the former    general counsel of America's National Security Agency,    concedes that the chips have probably killed encryption    controls in America, but argues that the battle will    continue to run in Europe, where countries such as France    limit their use. For the rest of the world, these bits of    silicon may indeed make it harder for police to protect    citizens. But they will also make it easier for citizens to    protect themselves.    --

The article Winn Schwartau cited today and a related column: ----------    The Sunday Times (London), June 9, 1996, p. 1/8    Secret DTI inquiry into cyber terror [Insight Column]    The government has been holding a secret investigation into    attacks by "cyber terrorists" on the City of London for    more than two years. The Department of Trade and Industry    (DTI), Bank of England, GCHQ, the secret listening station,    and the Defence Research Agency (DRA) are involved in the    inquiry.    The existence of the investigation, which began in April    1994, emerged after The Sunday Times revealed last week    that banks, broking firms and investment houses had paid    millions of pounds to gangs that threaten to wipe out    computer systems.    Correspondence from the investigating authorities, seen by    Insight, include letters from civil servants saying they    are "extremely concerned" at the evidence of extortion    demands.    Yesterday the DTI issued a statement confirming the inquiry    and suggesting its work had been hampered by the lack of    co-operation from City institutions.    "We are very interested in the allegations of extortion    directed at City of London institutions which were brought    to our attention in 1994. We responded then by involving    many government organisations, including the DTI, the    police, the Bank of England and other agencies. So far, we    have not been presented with any hard evidence from    victims. We would urge those threatened to come forward,"    a spokesman said.    In one letter, dated May 1995, David Hendon, director of    DTI technical affairs, wrote to a company specialising in    computer security work stating that he was taking the City    extortion issue "extremely seriously". Insight has since    seen the evidence passed to the DTI and GCHQ which sparked    the investigation. In 1994, a consultant working for a    company which undertakes computer risk assessments for City    institutions compiled a table of 46 attacks on banks and    finance houses in New York, London and other centres,    starting in January 1993.    The list included details of raids on three British banks    and one American investment house. The documents suggested    that operations in the futures markets had been a focus for    some of the attacks.    Documents sent by the DRA, from the office of Professor    David Parks, a senior director, indicate that the agency is    especially interested in the "weaponry" deployed by the    cyber terrorists.    The agency believes high-intensity radio frequency (HIRF)    guns may have been used to black out trading positions in    City finance houses. The weapon disables a computer by    firing electromagnetic radiation at it and is a "black    programme" at the defence ministry, one of the highest    security classification levels.    Last December, Parks approached a company which specialises    in defensive measures against information warfare and    carries out work for GCHQ. For a L30,000 fee it was asked    to arrange a demonstration of a portable HIRF weapon in    Germany.    Details of the HIRF weaponry and its use in the City have    also been compiled by Computing magazine, which intends to    pass them to the DTI and other authorities.

Before you start thinking it sounds like science fiction,    consider this: the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)    this weekend confirmed there is an official investigation    into "raids" by gangs of computer experts who threaten to    wipe out electronic information and trading systems, unless    they are paid off.    The DTI spoke out after last weekend's scoop by the Sunday    Times' Insight team revealing that some of London's best-    known institutions have paid huge ransoms to "electronic    highwaymen" to prevent the meltdown of computer networks.    These revelations have sent a shiver up the spines of the    City's top banks. Financiers are terrified the emergence of    a gaping hole in their systems will cause a loss of    investor and customer confidence -- and rightly so.    Can you imagine calling your stockbroker to buy a few    thousand ICI shares, only to be told its entire information    bank had been blown away by a Dick Turpin with a PhD in    electronic engineering?    If, like me, you know nothing about computer technology,    and care even less, the temptation is to dismiss the    problem as the creation of Arthur C Clarke. But the DTI has    acknowledged for the first time that an investigation into    these "attacks" has been under way for two years. The Bank    of England and GCHQ, the government's secret listening    station, are working alongside the DTI in the inquiry.    Agencies in Britain and America believe there have been    more than 40 raids on investment firms in New York, London    and other European financial centres since 1993. Victims    are understood to have paid up to L13m a time after    blackmailers showed their ability to bring electronic    trading in shares, bonds and commodities to a halt.    Futures-market systems have been a favoured target of the    space-age bandits. In some cases, the blackmailers have    used technology developed by military scientists.    But here is the paradox: the DTI has been hampered by the    reluctance of City firms involved to co-operate.    Extortionists have so frightened the investment houses,    they fear reprisals if they are discovered helping official    agencies track down the gangs. There is also concern that    an admission of the threats would diminish confidence in    the banking system and create a loss of face for the    victims. A banker told Insight: "You will never get a    financial institution to admit it has an extortion policy,    let alone that it has paid money."    That begs the question: who in London has paid up? Insight    has been told of at least four blue-chip firms caving in to    extortionists. For the time being, we have agreed to keep    certain information confidential to preserve the integrity    of the institutions while the agencies investigate. But the    names will eventually surface, and then there will be some    serious explaining to do.    [End]

The New York Times, June 10, 1996, p. A10.    The New Encryption Universe [Editorial]    The development of inexpensive computer programs and    hardware that scramble telephone calls and computer    messages to prevent eavesdropping is rapidly transforming    the world of cryptography. Once largely the domain of    governments and their intelligence services, encryption    technology is now commonly used by corporations, banks,    securities firms and individual computer operators. It is    time to revise Government encryption policy to fit this new    universe.    A panel of the National Research Council makes a convincing    case for doing just that after a careful review of    encryption issues. The panel calls on the Government to    abandon its effort to limit the development and    availability of advanced encryption technology. The Clinton    Administration has fought to preserve the Government's    ability to access commercial and individual communications    for law enforcement purposes by encouraging adoption of a    single encryption standard that Government agencies could    track and decipher if needed.    The Research Council panel leans the other way, urging the    commercial development of powerful encryption software even    though it would make wiretapping more difficult. It also    recommends that Washington ease restrictions on exports of    encryption technology.    The Government has long framed the debate over commercial    encryption around its need to fight crime through    wiretapping. The panel recognizes the usefulness of    court-authorized wiretaps. But the panel suggests that a    more important issue is the ability of the private sector    to transfer confidential financial and other data over    telecommunications pathways without interception.    The Clinton Administration wants the private sector to    adopt a type of encryption technology, known as key escrow,    that would give the Government the ability to unscramble    private phone or computer messages with court authorization    and thereby preserve its wiretap capability. But the policy    has so far failed several practical tests. The private    sector has not voluntarily adopted a Government-controlled    technology. In addition, encryption programs are already    available that allow almost anyone with a computer and    modem to work around Government-controlled technology. One    sophisticated system would allow two strangers -- people    who had swapped no private passwords -- to read each    other's encoded messages.    It seems likely that the Administration approach will not    succeed. If so, the danger is that Washington might move to    outlaw encryption technology it has not approved, a step    that would grossly violate American civil liberties. The    best way for the Government to protect its ability to    eavesdrop on domestic and foreign criminals is to stay    technically ahead of them. The panel recommends vigorous    Government research programs to that end.    The Research Council group would permit American computer    companies to export more powerful encryption software than    currently permitted. Foreigners already have access to    encryption systems that are more powerful than those    American companies are allowed to sell. The export    restrictions do nothing to keep encryption software out of    the hands of criminals and hostile governments, but    needlessly drive American exports out of foreign markets.    The panel's conclusions are especially credible because its    membership was not tilted against the Government. The    16-member panel was led by Kenneth Dam, a former Deputy    Secretary of State, and included Benjamin Civiletti, a    former Attorney General, and Ann Caracristi, a former    deputy director of the National Security Agency. The    Clinton Administration should take notice. It needs a new    encryption policy.    --

The Washington Post, June 10, 1996, p. A18.    Global Village Cops?    What will be the long-term effect of Internet technologies    on global law enforcement? The amazing story of Bill and    Anna Young, a k a Leslie Rogge and Judy Kay Wilson, offers    one possible scenario. The pseudonymous Youngs, residents    of Guatemala who the FBI says have been on a decade-long    run from U.S. justice since Mr. Rogge was convicted of a    string of bank robberies and other offenses, turned    themselves in to authorities after a neighbor recognized    Mr. Rogge's face on the FBI home page's Most Wanted list.    According to a story first told in the Guatemala Weekly,    the person who recognized him was a newly Internet-wired    14-year-old.    The vision of the future evoked by this story, of a world    in which the familiar "global village" becomes a place not    just of instant communication but of neighborly nosiness    and where no one can just melt into the crowd, is    reassuring and unnerving in about equal proportions. (What    if it were a network of hit men or an authoritarian    government seeking a dissident, rather than the FBI, making    use of this powerful technology?) But it's also worth    keeping in mind that, other than the romance of the    technology, it doesn't represent that great an advance on    current global media that have made celebrities or    fugitives' faces familiar to a vast public -- just ask    Salman Rushdie. The Rogge nabbing is the first that the FBI    credits to its home page specifically, but TV's "America's    Most Wanted" has scored similar coups.    The impossibility of predicting the exact shape of these    extensions of policing is relevant as well to a report that    the National Research Council recently issued on another    computer technology issue -- the vexed matter of whether to    ease export controls on encryption software, which encodes    information sent electronically so that only a user with a    key can decipher it.    The government until now has resisted lifting controls on    "uncrackable" encryption software --  that is, codes that    are too complex to be broken by brute force -- unless the    industry agrees to deposit keys in an escrow arrangement    with a third party so the government can seek and obtain a    warrant to read encoded communications if necessary.    Software makers, meanwhile, are pushing hard to have these    restrictions eased. The research council, an arm of the    generally neutral National Academy of Sciences, sought to    bridge the gap between industry interests and such    government agencies as the FBI and national security    agencies, whose case, they say, is based largely on    classified matter that can't be publicly discussed.    Part of the report's conclusion, which favors the easing    though not the abolition of current restrictions, is that    wider use of encryption technology will actually *help*    national security and law enforcement because more data,    economic and otherwise, will be secure to begin with. But    if the news of the changing terrain tells anything, it is    that it is far too soon to base arguments on such a    premise. Our own sense on encryption is that the national    security and law enforcement questions remain too important    to be sacrificed lightly, despite the considerable economic    interests of the parties on the other side. But the world    of Internet law enforcement is still taking shape. Whatever    the public conclusion on encryption, the debate should not    rest on any assumptions about what that shape will be.    --

6-11-96. FiTi:    "US squares up to cyberterrorists."       Until recently, the concept of "information warfare" has       been widely dismissed as alarmist rhetoric and viewed as       "post Cold War hysteria" generated by those with an       interest in maintaining the vast US intelligence       apparatus. But the potential use of computer networks to       undermine public confidence, disrupt essential services,       play havoc with the economy or damage military       capabilities is now being taken seriously in Washington.       Encryption may be just one of many battlegrounds --       others include: proposals for mandatory reporting of       corporate computer intrusions and for exceptions to US       laws that prohibit intelligence agencies from snooping       on domestic communications; the forthcoming ruling by US       courts on free speech on the Internet, in response to       laws aimed at stopping distribution of pornographic       material; and possible limits on information that       marketers may gather and use about children who surf the       Internet.

Foreign Policy, Summer 1996:    "Information Age Intelligence." by Bruce D. Berkowitz,    a former CIA analyst and staff member for the Senate    Intelllgence Committee. Excerpts of 14-page essay:       During most of this century, the intelligence       community led the world in developing information       technology. Intelligence organizations were deeply       involved in the development of telegraph and       telephone networks, modern computers, and       space-based communications and surveillance       systems. The intelligence community also       established new forms of analysis and areas of       expertise.       Yet several signs suggest that the intelligence       community is no longer the leader in the       information world, and it may have fallen behind       significantly in some respects. The underlying       problem is that the intelligence community has       failed to keep up with changes in how modern       society uses information and how information       technology develops in modern society. As a       result, our model for intelligence is out-of-date.       This reality is what current efforts at       intelligence reform are failing to recognize.       The intelligence community needs to move as fast       as information businesses do to capture markets,       but the traditional organization is not up to the       task. Today's model for intelligence -- how it is       organized and how it operates -- is an artifact       from an earlier age. Even the name "Central       Intelligence Agency" is reminiscent of the New       Deal era, when large, powerful, national       bureaucracies were the accepted way of getting       things done efficiently. It makes less sense in a       world moving toward fluid, distributed, networked       information organizations.       As the capabilities of the private sector improve,       the intelligence community will need to move on to       the next frontier of technology or expertise that       the private sector has yet to fill. While one       challenge for intelligence reform is to keep up       with these changes, fundamentally the greater       challenge will be to establish an organization       that can adapt with the times.       One reason why the intelligence community cannot       deal effectively with the Information Revolution       is that intelligence requirements and the       intelligence community's comparative advantage are       both fluid, but the traditional intelligence       bureaucracy remains static. In addition,       organizations responsible for developing and       applying technology, such as the National       Reconnaissance Office (NRC)) and the National       Security Agency (NSA), have created organizational       dogma, and dogma always resist change. Once such       organizations carve out a place for themselves       (and their technologies) in the budget, they can       be difficult to dislodge. The fact that these       organizations often operate at a classified level       further insulates them. As a result, the       intelligence community often locks into specific       technologies, even when new and possibly better       ideas have come along.     ----- Our Web site was hosed clean today, so this article may not survive.

Summary    The Government recognises the importance of the development    of the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) with respect    to the continuing competitiveness of UK companies. Its aim    is to facilitate the development of electronic commerce by    the introduction of measures which recognise the growing    demand for encryption services to safeguard the integrity    and confidentiality of electronic information transmitted    on public telecommunications networks.    2.  The policy, which has been decided upon after detailed    discussion between Government Departments, involves the    licensing and regulation of Trusted Third Parties    (hereafter called TTPs) which will provide a range of    information security services to their clients, whether    they are corporate users or individual citizens. The    provision of such information security services will be    welcomed by IT users, and will considerably facilitate the    establishment of, and industry's participation in, the GII,     where trust in the security of communication has been    acknowledged to be of paramount importance. The licensing    policy will aim to preserve the ability of the intelligence    and law enforcement agencies to fight serious crime and    terrorism by establishing procedures for disclosure to them    of encryption keys, under safeguards similar to those which    already exist for warranted interception under the    Interception of Communications Act.      3.  The Government intends to bring forward proposals for    legislation following consultation by the Department of    Trade and Industry on detailed policy proposals.

6-15-96. NYP Mag:    "Dead as a Dollar."       For everyone who uses cash, everyone who stores it and       everyone who regulates it, a challenge is nearing. The       challenge will be to make choices. Some kinds of       electronic currency will protect privacy, and some will       violate privacy. Some will make crime easier, and some       will make it extraordinarily difficult. Some will tax       commerce parasitically, and some will catalyze it. The       new minters of money will have enormous power to choose       -- unless consumers, on the one hand, and Government       officials, on the other, decide to make their own       choices.       In the "current climate," as those in Washington tend to       say, anything that smacks of an expanded role for the       Government is anathema. Policy makers at the Treasury       are reluctant even to talk about electronic money on the       record. "It's easy to go in and say, 'Oh, we're going to       regulate everything,' without knowing what everything       is," says a senior Treasury official. "We want to know       what everything is." He adds: "There are very serious       policy issues -- seigniorage, money laundering,       financial- stability issues, consumer issues that are       genuinely important that we must address and look hard       at. It may be sensible for the Government to issue a       card -- that's conceivable -- but what if you issue it       and nobody uses it?"       As money enters a new age, so does counterfeiting. The       ultimate threat is the perfect copy -- the virtual coin       that proves mathematically identical to the real thing.       If money is a string of bits, then someone, some where,       can make a perfect copy, and another and another. An       arms race is already raging between those working to       armor-plate digital cash with doubly and triply secure       cryptography and those working to pierce the armor.       Security experts assume that nefarious characters, in       search of an unending stream of money, are already       investing millions in the next stages of research and       development.       For every new idea in tamper resistance, there is a new       idea in tampering.... "At least you can cause people to       have to spend a lot of money," says Eric Hughes, a       cryptography expert. "But doing the second chip is far,       far less money than the first. And if you could make a       master chip that spoke the right protocol, you could       make a little money mint for yourself."       "Information warfare is going to make people very       worried downstream," says Crook at Citicorp. "We have an       immense paranoia about how dangerous it's going to be.       I think that the security requirements in our industry       are going to be more severe than at the Department of       Defense."       Cryptography is as close as modern mathematics comes to       magic.       It's simply a design choice. Smart cards, or their       on-line equivalents, could function as blindly as raw       cash. They could be even less traceable than in Chaum's       system. That is a frightening prospect to law-       enforcement authorities. Having finally made life       difficult for drug smugglers with heavy cash suitcases,       they will not casually allow the manufacture of half-       ounce chips that could make possible blind transfers of       hundreds of millions of dollars, a money launderer's       dream. Even if the Government takes no other action in       the electronic-money arena, it will surely move to       extend its restrictions on cash to cover digital       equivalents. And so far, the large institutions entering       the electronic-money arena are leaning toward       less-anonymous, less-private approaches than Chaum's,       betting that most of us will be willing to sacrifice       more pieces of privacy for, say, convenience. Chaum       could prove right, but only if the marketplace is       willing to cast its votes for privacy.

As a complement to Jim Choate's forward on the "trits"    communication research, we suggest perusing an interview of    the philosopher Paul Virilio. Here're are excerpts from the    interview available at:           PAUL VIRILIO: I have to take a detour through physics here,    and this is one of the differences between and Baudrillard    and myself. Unlike him, I have a formal scientific    education (that's why physics and military sciences kept me    busy for a very long time). In the past, reality was a    matter of mass; then it became mass + force. Today, reality    is the outcome of: mass + force + information. Matter has    now become truly three-dimensional. This is a clear break.    What we have witnessed in Italy, with Berlusconi seizing    power, is the first successful media-coup in history. Italy    is again Europe's avant-garde, and is showing us where the    new political alternative resides - in a realm where "left"    or "right" are no longer relevant. The new political    alternative is between the old political class on one side,    and the new media-class on the other. With Italy, the    media-class has now seized power in Europe. It will also    happen in the United States, in France, in Spain, and    elsewhere.    CARLOS OLIVEIRA: Do you see some kind of media-fascism    looming on the horizon?    PAUL VIRILIO: No, because what I see is far worse! Due to    its overwhelming power, the totalitarianism of the    information-medium is going to be even more powerful than    the traditional political totalitarianism of the old    national-socialist or communist hues. The dangers are    looming larger. I repeat: only if one is guarded against    its dangers will it be possible to enjoy the positive    aspects of the developments in the realm of new    technologies.    CARLOS OLIVEIRA: In your eyes, is there any way out of this    rather bleak situation?    PAUL VIRILIO: An accompanying evil here is the end of    writing, as it unfolds through image technology,    cinema/film, and television-screen. These new developments    threaten the ability to conjure up mental images with    oblivion. The typical modern human is characterized by a    life under the dictatorship of the screen, to which the    written word falls victim. We don't read any more, we    hardly write each other - since we can call each other on    the phone. Next, we will no longer speak! I'd really like    to say: this will indeed be the silence of the lambs!

For background on the recent cyber-terrorists reports from    London, we offer the Council on Foreign Relations' 1995    report:                       NON-LETHAL TECHNOLOGIES                  Military Options and Implications                 Report of an Independent Task Force    The long history of military operations has been marked by    steady increases in the lethality of weapons. U.S.    commanders and policymakers face excruciating dilemmas in    decisions to use lethal force. They strive to maximize    protection of their own troops and to minimize collateral    casualties among noncombatants. Authoritarian regimes -- as    in Iraq -- and factions in civil wars -- as in Bosnia --    may see fear of American casualties as one factor in    deterring intervention against them. Terrorists, guerillas,    and other irregular forces often exploit noncombatant    populations by mounting attacks from their midst.    Can technology, ease these dilemmas by providing    acceptable, effective non-lethal capabilities to supplement    conventional weapons across a broad spectrum of conflict?    In major wars or similiar cases of high-level violence, can    such capabilities reduce the risk to U.S. forces by, in    effect, substituting technology for manpower in performing    certain missions, for example, by shutting off power    transmission and communications of adversaries? In    situations short of traditional warfare -- for example, the    humanitarian intervention in Somalia -- can non-lethal    systems help provide calibrated coercion proportional to    the objectives? How do they relate to the lethal systems on    which U.S. forces depend? What policy issues do such    technologies pose? In this report a bipartisan task force,    including former Air Force and Army chiefs of staff,    leading scientists, and other experts, examines these    questions. The task force concludes that a number of    non-lethal technologies deserve serious consideration in    U.S. planning and development for future military    contingencies.

Three feathers for spying technology:    TST: "MI6 stole secrets from French navy."       Top secret technology for tracking nuclear submarines       has been stolen from a French naval base by MI6,       Britain's foreign intelligence service, after a French       civilian engineer was paid thousands of pounds to betray       one of his country's most closely guarded secrets to an       MI6 front company which posed as a technical defence       consultancy and publishing house.

However,       officials of the affected U.S. companies charge it       amounts to unfair competition because an Israeli company       is about to enter the space surveillance business and it       wouldn't face similar restrictions.

@_subject: The Rise of the Virtual State 
Foreign Affairs, July/August, 1996.    "The Rise of the Virtual State" [Excerpts]       Richard Rosecrance, UCLA Professor of Political Science    Amid the supposed clamor of contending cultures and    civilizations, a new reality is emerging. The nation-state    is becoming a tighter, more vigorous unit capable of    sustaining the pressures of worldwide competition.    Developed states are putting aside military, political, and    territorial ambitions as they struggle not for cultural    dominance but for a greater share of world output.    Countries are not uniting as civilizations and girding for    conflict with one another. Instead, they are downsizing --    in function if not in geographic form. Today and for the    foreseeable future, the only international civilization    worthy of the name is the governing economic culture of the    world market.    Timeworn methods of augmenting national power and wealth    are no longer effective. Like the headquarters of a virtual    corporation, the virtual state determines overall strategy    and invests in its people rather than amassing expensive    production capacity. It contracts out other functions to    states that specialize in or need them. Imperial Great     Britain may have been the model for the nineteenth century,    but Hong Kong will be the model for the 21st.    As a result of these trends, the world may increasingly    become divided into "head" and "body" nations, or nations    representing some combination of those two functions.    The world is embarked on a progressive emancipation from    land as a determinant of production and power.    Diminishing their command of real estate and productive    assets, nations are downsizing, in functional if not in    geographic terms. Small nations have attained peak    efficiency and competitiveness, and even large nations have    begun to think small. If durable access to assets elsewhere    can be assured, the need to physically possess them    diminishes.    The virtual state is an agile entity operating in twin    jurisdictions: abroad and at home. It is as prepared to    mine gains overseas as in the domestic economy. But in    large countries, internationalization operates    differentially. Political and economic decision-makers have    begun to recast their horizons, but middle managers and    workers lag behind. They expect too much and give and learn    too little. That is why the dawn of the virtual state must    also be the sunrise of international education and    training. The virtual state cannot satisfy all its    citizens. The possibility of commanding economic power in    the sense of effective state control has greatly declined.    Displaced workers and businesspeople must be willing to    look abroad for opportunities. In the United States, they    can do this only if American education prepares the way.    ----------       (39 kb)    VST_ate

@_subject: NS on TTPs 
New Scientist, 22 July 1996, p. 10.    Crackdown on Net Crooks 'a charter for state snoopers'    Britain and France have become the first European nations    to take concerted action against swindlers and other    criminals operating on the Internet. The governments of    both countries last week announced plans to license Trusted    Third Parties (TTPs) to act as "honest brokers" for online    business transactions. But civil liberties campaigners fear    that the schemes may be snoopers' charters, giving police    forces and security agencies unprecedented opportunities to    spy on the world of business.    The idea is for TTPs to act as "introduction agencies" that    will reassure each party to a deal that the other has been    vetted and is reputable. TTPs will also hand out encryption    software that business partners will use to exchange    information in confidence. But in both countries, TTPs will    be required to release the keys to this encryption to the    police or the security services, on production of an    appropriate warrant.    Currently there are few safeguards to protect those    contemplating buying goods or services over the Internet    from fraudsters. "Cyberspace has become the new frontier    for scam artists," concluded a report released by the US    Federal Trade Commission last month. "The scams are not new    but the medium is."    John Moroney, a senior consultant at the computer    consultancy Ovum, believes TTPs are the best way to drive    forward the growth of business over the Internet. As online    transactions become commonplace, he argues, banks may be    especially keen to volunteer as TTPs, to protect their    dominance in the financial services market. "If home    shopping takes off they could be left exposed," says    Moroney.    But Simon Davies, director of the London-based civil    liberties watchdog, Privacy International calls the plan    "naive". He argues that businesses are perfectly capable of    setting up secure systems for electronic trade without    government involvement: "What is the government doing in    this field in the first place?" The British and French    proposals, Davies says, bear a strong resemblance to the    failed "Clipper chip" plan in the US.    The Clipper scheme involved building a scrambling chip into    all new telephones and computers. The keys to the scrambler    would have been in the hands of government-appointed    agencies. "With Clipper it quickly became clear the agenda    was broader than initially stated," says Davies, "and that    is exactly what will happen in Europe." He fears that if    the scheme takes off, companies not using TTP-approved    encryption software will instantly come under surveillance    by the police or security services.    The Department of Trade and Industry in Britain rejects    this claim. "The government licensing of TTPs is just a way    of enhancing consumer confidence," says a spokesman, who    adds that there are no plans to ban non-TTP software.    Banks, trade associations and telecommunications firms are    the most likely candidates for becoming TTPs, the DTI says.    -- Mark Ward    [End]

The Washington Post, June 25, 1996.    Domain Delinquents Get Day's Reprieve       Firm Delays Suspension of Internet Service to Process       Flood of Fees    By David S. Hilzenrath    The Herndon company that assigns the basic addresses on the    Internet said yesterday it would delay until this evening    a plan to cut off the service of address holders who    haven't paid the required fees.    Network Solutions Inc., which registers addresses under an    arrangement with the federal government, had planned to cut    off the delinquents yesterday, but postponed the action as    it processed a flood of last-minute payments.    The cutoffs involve about 10,000 of 400,000 "domain" names    -- the portion of the Internet address that follows the "    symbol -- whose holders have not paid Network Solutions a    $100 registration fee.    Network Solutions spokesman David Gravff said the company    would suspend service for those domain holders that had not    paid by 5 p.m. on Sunday. The service of those who pay    between that time and tonight will be suspended, but the    company will soon reinstate it. The cutoff involves domain    holders that registered their addresses between Sept. 14,    when Network Solutions began charging new users, and Feb.    28.    Domain names may be held by companies, universities,    individuals, government agencies or other organizations,    and a single domain name might be used by many people.    People using domain names that are suspended would not be    able to receive electronic mail. Similarly, people would    not be able to connect to World Wide Web sites using    suspended domains.    The company two weeks ago estimated that 25,000 domain    names would be suspended, but it reduced the total as    last-minute payments arrived.    The company will wait 60 days before reissuing the    suspended domain names to new users, giving delinquent    users another chance to pay and reclaim them, Graves said.    -----    For More Information: Is your domain name available?

The New York Times, June 26, 1996, p. B7.    Head of C.I.A. Plans Center To Protect Federal Computers    By Tim Weiner    Washington, June 25 -- Alarmed at the growing threat that    computer hackers pose to national security, the Director of    Central Intelligence today announced plans to create a    "cyberwar" center to protect the bits and bytes that weave    the nation together.    The United States cannot be brought to its knees by a    madman with a modem. But the Director, John M. Deutch, said    the nation's intelligence agencies were alert to the threat    of "very, very large" attacks on the computers that run    Defense Department war rooms, power plants, telephone    systems, air traffic control centers and international    financial transfers.    "The electron," Mr. Deutch warned, "is the ultimate    precision-guided weapon."    Mr. Deutch said he was seeking to create a cyberwar center    at the National Security Agency, the giant electronic    eavesdropping branch of American intelligence. He said the    center could focus the Government's previously scattershot    efforts to understand and combat the threats posed by    governments, terrorist groups and mischievous teen-agers.    Mr. Deutch's first public statement about information    warfare came in testimony before Senator Sam Nunn, the    Georgia Democrat who called a hearing of a Senate    Governmental Affairs subcommittee to discuss the    little-understood, highly classified problem.    "There are some who believe we are going to have to have an    electronic Pearl Harbor, so to speak, before we really make    this the kind of priority that many of us believe it    deserves to be made," Mr. Nunn said. "Do you think we're    going to need that kind of real awakening, or are we fully    alerted to this danger now?"    Mr. Deutch replied: "I think that we are fully alerted to    it now. I don't know whether we will face an electronic    Pearl Harbor, but we will have, I'm sure, some very    unpleasant circumstances."    He added, "I'm certainly prepared to predict some very,    very large and uncomfortable incidents."    Mr. Deutch said cyberwar could become a 21st-century    national security threat second only to nuclear, biological    and chemical weapons.    Potential attackers may already possess the sophisticated    techniques they would need to bring off a cataclysmic    crash, many experts believe, but they still lack the deep    knowledge of their targets and direct access to the    computer systems they would seek to disable.    Military and civilian organizations are increasingly    dependent on evermore complicated and interlinked systems.    They run the risk of understanding the threat less and less    as it becomes more and more complex Mr. Nunn and Mr. Deutch    suggested.    Senator Nunn also said intelligence agencies have    communications problems with banks, telecommunications    companies and other business ventures vulnerable to cyber    attacks.    "There's a great reluctance by the private sector to    discuss the threat that they've faced or even the attacks    that have already occurred," he said, "because they fear    that the word would go out they're vulnerable, and    therefore could destroy or damage consumer confidence and    thereby cost them business."    "At some point," the Senator added, "there's got to be    communication here."    [End]

The latter part of this article elaborates the NYT report    today.    The Washington Post, June 26, 1996, p. A19.    CIA Gears Up to Thwart 'Information Attacks'       Deutch Lists Computer Break-Ins, Terrorism as       High-Priority Potential Threats to National Security    By R. Jeffrey Smith    CIA director John M. Deutch warned yesterday that the    country is likely to experience some a very large and    uncomfortable" disruptions of vital computer systems at the    hands of foreign terrorists or hostile nations in coming    years, but pledged a major new U.S. effort to detect and    combat the threat of computer break-ins.    "We have evidence that a number of countries around the    world are developing the doctrine, strategies, and tools to    conduct information attacks" on military-related computers,    Deutch told a hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee    on Investigations, while declining to name these nations.    Deutch added that he is convinced that foreigners are    becoming increasingly aware "that advanced societies,    especially the United States, are increasingly dependent on    open and potentially vulnerable" computers to control    electric power, airplane traffic, telecommunications and    financial operations -- posing an attractive target for    virtually "any nation or foreign terrorist organization."    Emphasizing that the Clinton administration has just begun    to grasp the dangers involved and begin working on the    problem, Deutch said "we are not well-organized as a    government to address these issues" and cautioned that    making vital computers much less vulnerable to attack may    take decades.    "The electron is the ultimate precision-guided weapon,"    Deutch said, but "it is not [a problem about] which it's    absolutely apparent ... the best way to proceed."    Deutch said he nonetheless had already drawn up plans to    create an office at the National Security Agency to be    called the Information Warfare Technology Center, which    will focus on analyzing the risks that foreign hackers pose    to U.S. computers and help create new methods of    investigating and defending the U.S. against electronic    break-ins.    Deutch also said that he supports creating a "real-time    response center" for any major domestic or foreign attacks    against civilian computers under the supervision of the    Justice Department, as well as a separate, Defense    Department center for responding to attacks on    military-related computers.    Deutch disclosed that the intelligence community conducted    an extensive survey last year of the risks of an attack on    computers controlling U.S. telephones, the electric power    grid, oil refineries and other utilities. He said the    results are classified, but added that a new, broader    estimate of the threat is to be completed by December.    He also said the intelligence community has begun to hunt    more diligently for evidence of any foreign intent to    attack U.S. computers, any sign of foreign sponsorship for    U.S.-based computer hacking activities, and for any    indication that foreign organized crime figures are    becoming involved in attacks on computers at U.S. financial    institutions.    The Defense Intelligence Agency, moreover, is trying to    develop a way to predict a major "information warfare    attack" against the United States, Deutch said.    One obstacle is that banks and other private institutions    have been reluctant to divulge any evidence of computer    intrusions for fear that it will leak and erode the    confidence of their customers. Deutch said "the situation    is improving" but that more cooperation was needed from    major corporations, and said the CIA remains willing to    share information with such firms about the risks they    might face.    Although he declined to cite any specific examples of    computer warfare, Deutch said he would list it as the    second most worrisome threat to U.S. national security --    just below the threat posed by foreign chemical, nuclear,    and biological arms.    In answer to a question from Senator Sam Nunn (D Ga.) about    whether the government was aware of the danger, Deutch    said, "I don't know whether we will face an electronic    Pearl Harbor, but we will have, I'm sure, some very    unpleasant circumstances in this area or our allies    will.... I'm certainly prepared to predict some very, very    large and uncomfortable incidents in this area."    [End]     Final notice:  Wash Post on the Web at:

CIA Director Deutch's comments in the Defense Daily article below about hacker surveillance and the national security threat of anonymity:    "Tools are readily available on the Internet, and    hackers [computer experts] are a source for any    foreign nation or terrorist organization," he said.    The personal anonymity provided by cyberspace also    aids foreign agents, Deutch said, adding that    "hackers, with or without their full knowledge, may be    supplying advice and expertise to rogue states such as    Iran and Libya."    The CIA and other agencies are working to collect    information about hackers and their activities from    both informants and from other advanced means,    including signals intelligence, Deutch said. The CIA    is working closely with the Federal Bureau of    Investigations (FBI) and the Department of Justice to    collect and analyze information about hackers and    their relationships with organized crime and foreign    agents, he said. ------ Defense Daily, 26 June 1996 Deutch Orders Information Warfare Estimate The nation's top intelligence official said Tuesday that he has ordered a major review of foreign threats to the U.S. information, banking, and telecommunications networks.  "The treat of information warfare and the damage it could cause to the U.S. is so significant that it warrants an National Intelligence Estimate (NIE)," John Deutch, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), told the Senate Government Affairs committee yesterday. He added that disruption of the information infrastructure could give terrorists or foreign governments the ability to weaken U.S. national security. "Information attacks could not only disrupt our daily lives, but also seriously jeopardize our national or economic security," he added. Deutch said he ordered the NIE to focus attention on how vulnerable the nation's computer-based telecommunications and information networks are to foreign governments and terrorist groups, which are both, despite their relative differences in personnel and funding, potential threats to U.S. information networks. Information warfare is neither manpower intensive nor an expensive form of terrorism, Deutch said, adding that even the smallest radical group can exploit the unregulated and undefended expanse of cyberspace. For example, the Islamic militant group Hezboullah has been using the Internet and other modern means of communications for their daily operations, Deutch said. Such technology could also be used to launch a terrorist act on the U.S., he added. This NIE will determine the damage terrorists or foreign governments could inflict were they to combine information warfare techniques with conventional military tactics to attack the U.S. An NIE, which details potential security threats to the U.S., is usually crafted by the National Intelligence Council (NIC), a senior panel of career intelligence officers and academics. This NIE, however, will also include comments from the U.S. law enforcement community, the Defense Information Security Agency, the armed services, and representatives from the major telecommunications providers, Deutch said. The threat estimate is expected to be complete by December 1, 1996, he added. Preliminary evaluations conducted by the U.S. intelligence community suggest that such a coordinated information attack could seriously disrupt electric power grids, air traffic control centers, banks and the stock market, or even the operational effectiveness of deployed U.S. military forces. Deutch is concerned about the ease with which enemy agents can obtain the hardware and software required to attack the information infrastructure. "Tools are readily available on the Internet, and hackers [computer experts] are a source for any foreign nation or terrorist organization," he said. The personal anonymity provided by cyberspace also aids foreign agents, Deutch said, adding that "hackers, with or without their full knowledge, may be supplying advice and expertise to rogue states such as Iran and Libya." In addition to the high technology, computer-based threat to the U.S. information infrastructure, foreign agents could use conventional explosives to destroy key information facilities and data processing centers. Previous studies conducted by the U.S. intelligence community suggests that numerous foreign nations are creating "cyber-warfare" techniques for application on the modern battlefield, Deutch said. Those programs are geared towards crippling an enemy's command and control centers or disabling air defense networks, he added. Based upon the progress made by these military programs, disrupting U.S. civilian and commercial information networks would be easy, Deutch said. The U.S. intelligence community has begun several activities in response to the emerging cyber-threat, he said. The CIA and other agencies are working to collect information about hackers and their activities from both informants and from other advanced means, including signals intelligence, Deutch said. The CIA is working closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Department of Justice to collect and analyze information about hackers and their relationships with organized crime and foreign agents, he said. Both the intelligence and law enforcement communities are trying to work with private industry and academia in this cyber-warfare campaign, he said. The Pentagon and the CIA may reorganize existing personnel and efforts to create a new information warfare center at the National Security Agency, he added. -----

@_subject: The End of Science 
Natalie Angier, the sharp-witted science reporter for The    New York Times, reviews "The End of Science," by John    Horgan, a senior writer at Scientific American, in the June        In this intellectually bracing, sweepingly reported,       often brilliant and sometimes bullying book, John Horgan       makes the powerful case that the best and most exciting       scientific discoveries are behind us. He argues that       many scientists today, particularly those he interviewed       for this book, are "gripped by a profound unease." Part       of that malaise results from all the sociopolitical       irritants we've heard about: the dwindling financial       resources, the vicious competition, the strident       antipathy of animal rights activists, religious       fundamentalists, technophobes and the like.       But a far more important source of despair, Mr. Horgan       insists, is that scientists are beginning to sense that       "the great era of scientific discovery is over." The big       truths, the primordial truths, the pure truths about       "the universe and our place in it" have already been       mapped out. Science has been so spectacularly successful       at describing the principal features of the universe, on       a scale from quarks to the superstructure of galaxies,       that the entire enterprise may well end up the       paradoxical victim of its own prosperity. "Further       research may yield no more great revelations or       revolutions," he writes, "but only incremental,       diminishing returns."    While Angier does not agree with his thesis that the major    problems of science have been solved, she commends his    incisive critique of scientists who cannot give up the    dream of omniscience, many of whom he has interviewed for    the book -- Stephen Jay Gould, Roger Penrose, Steven    Weinberg, Daniel Dennett, Stuart Kauffman, Marvin Minsky,    John Wheeler, Frank Tipler and others.    She summarizes Horgan's view of detumescent science:       Where does that leave contemporary scientists? They can       either pursue small, manageable and vaguely boring       science (sequencing the complete complement of human DNA       may fall into this category), or they can turn to what       Mr. Horgan calls "ironic science." Such science is       "speculative, postempirical," resembling literary       criticism "in that it offers points of view, opinions,       which are, at best, interesting." Ironic science is       provocative, he says, but it fails to converge on the       truth. " It cannot achieve empirically verifiable       surprises that force scientists to make substantial       revisions in their basic description of reality," he       writes.    ----------    For those without access to NYT, the full review is    available at:          (11 kb)    Or, we will E-mail a copy.

June 28 the NYT and Wash Post reported on a new report on    intelligence:       In From the Cold: The Report of the Twentieth Century       Fund Task Force on the Future of U.S. Intelligence.    This report supplements and differs somewhat from the three    released earlier this year by the Brown Commission,    Representative Combest's Committee and the Council on    Foreign Relations. It recommends greater emphasis on    economic intelligence and less on military support as well    as reduction of covert operations. Here's an excerpt from    the Foreword:       The Task Force discerned basic problems that merit far       greater attention. Foremost among them is the       intelligence community's increasing preoccupation with       military priorities since the Soviet Union's collapse,       which has coincided with a decline in the usefulness of       intelligence to civilian policymakers. To help strike a       more equitable balance between the military and civilian       needs of the government, the Task Force proposes       specific recommendations for strengthening what it       perceives to be four pervasive shortcomings: 1) the       atrophying analytic capabilities of the intelligence       community and U.S. foreign policy agencies; 2) the lack       of productive and effective interactions between the       intelligence community and civilian officials who make       foreign policy decisions; 3) a clandestine service whose       costs have too often exceeded its benefits; and 4)       poorly organized, unfocused, and often mediocre economic       intelligence efforts.    The full volume is 275 pages, composed of introductions,     the main 21-page report and three extensive and detailed    background papers of 248 pages.

EcoMist, March 2, 1996:    "Many people believe that the Internet will make middlemen    extinct. It is more likely to help them thrive."       The Net's fans argue that it allows consumers to bypass       intermediaries while increasing their choices and       finding better bargains. One influential proponent of       this idea is Bill Gates. Compelling as they seem,       however, these arguments do not prove their case.       Hal Varian, an economist at the UC Berkeley, claims       there will be greater competition among intermediaries,       and maybe many more of them. Instead of competing on the       basis of inside information, those agents will compete       by adding value in other ways.       The Internet will put some intermediaries out of       business, but it will create more work for others. And       among these will be not only  suppliers of familiar       services, but also a new breed monitoring Internet       sites, collecting news and information, and repackaging       it -- folk, in other words, like Mr Gates.

The New York Times, March 4, 1996, p. D4.    Compromise Bills Due on Data Encryption       Industry Opponents and Civil Libertarians Are Lukewarm,       at Best    By John Markoff    Legislation will be introduced in the House and the Senate    tomorrow in an effort to break the deadlock between the    computer industry and the Clinton Administration over the    control and export of software and hardware used to    scramble electronic data.    So far, though, the proposed measures have received only    cautious endorsement from industry executives, while    civil-liberties and privacy groups say they are worried    that the bills would enable the Government to decode    scrambled transmissions.    Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and    Representative Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, plan    to introduce similar bills that affirm the right of    Americans to use any type of data-coding equipment without    restriction and prohibit the mandatory use of special keys    that would allow law-enforcement agencies to read scrambled    data. Their bills would also make it a crime to use    encryption technology in committing a crime and would    permit the export of data-coding software and hardware if    similar technology was available from a foreign supplier.    Data-coding, or encryption, technology is based on    mathematical formulas that rely on the immense computing    challenge inherent in factoring large numbers. Until    recently, such technology was largely used by military and    intelligence organizations and by some corporations like    banks. As electronic mail and commerce have become    increasingly accessible, however, the technology has become    more controversial.    In April 1993, the Clinton Administration proposed a    national data-encryption standard known as Clipper, based    on a system that would have made it possible for    law-enforcement agencies, if authorized by a court, to    decode private voice and data communications.    The Clipper initiative has been strongly opposed by    industry executives and privacy advocates. They argue that    reliable coding technology is essential for commerce and    privacy protection on the Internet. They also say that    strict export rules are increasingly hindering the ability    of United States corporations to compete with foreign    suppliers.    The proposed legislation would ease some current    restrictions on the exporting of data-coding systems, but    civil libertarians still see areas of concern.    "The bills relax export controls, which is clearly a step    in the right direction," conceded Marc Rotenberg, director    of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington    research and policy organization. But the negatives, he    said, were that the bills opened the door to Government    access to private transactions "and criminalize the use of    cryptography when it is used to perpetrate a crime."    Industry officials said they expected the legislation to    stir little enthusiasm from corporate users. "Corporate    America is absolutely unwilling to give a third party    control of their data," said Jim Bidzos, chief executive of    RSA Data Security, a maker of encryption software based in    Redwood City, Calif.

Does anyone how to get a copy of the report on "privacy    enhancing technologies - the path to anonymity" cited in    this paper from the Canberra/OECD conference on Feb 7-8:           Issues Facing Government : Meeting Public Concerns    Kevin O'Connor    Privacy Commissioner, Australia    [Giant snip]       In my own sphere of activity, there is some discussion       taking place over the potential of new technologies and       applications to assist with privacy protection.  A       recent report from the Dutch and Ontario Privacy       Commissioners entitled Privacy enhancing technologies -       the path to anonymity, offers some intriguing       suggestions about the potential of public key       cryptography for use in digital signatures to act as       'identity protectors' - allowing transactions to be       completed and accounted for without the true identity of       the participants needing to be known.       While there are some obvious concerns about such       technologies from a law enforcement perspective, which       we have already heard about from the previous speaker,       these should not be insuperable obstacles.  On the other       hand, the registration of digital signatures and public       keys, with sufficient integrity to gain commercial and       governmental confidence, itself raises additional       privacy concerns.  The complex issues involved are only       just starting to be addressed. ...    -----    Encouragingly, another paper by Matthew Bowcock           states:    [Big snip]       Controls on Encryption Technology       There has been much heated debate worldwide about       restrictions on the use of encryption technology, so       that law enforcement and national security agencies can       continue to intercept communications. Two questions are       worth asking in this debate.       Firstly, is interception of private communications a       governmental right, which must therefore be protected in       the face of technological change, or is it an accidental       consequence of the weaknesses of the communication       techniques that we have been using? I would argue that       it is the latter and that there is no community       obligation to protect it.       Secondly, is a country better served by a vibrant,       efficient, electronic economy, using trusted secure       communication techniques for its day to day business, or       by attempting to reduce organised crime by restricting       use of technology? So far, much of the opposition to       restrictions on the use of encryption technology has       centred around a right to privacy and civil libertarian       issues. Perhaps, instead, we need to quantify the       opportunity cost, in economic terms, of delayed and       lower levels of adoption of electronic commerce by the       business community because the security mechanisms are       not sufficiently trustworthy. It may be that the cost to       the economy of restricting the use of encryption       technology outweighs the benefits to the community. ...

Financial Times, March 6, 1996, IT Section, p. V.    Network Security: Operating under a cloud of uncertainty       Companies face a complex web of technical, legal and       moral questions    The IT security threat has long been depicted in terms of    wild-eyed hackers hunched over terminals late into the    night. But while there is real cause for concern about    criminal activity over computer networks, large    corporations are very worried about another threat to their    use of electronic communications.    Meanwhile, government restrictions on the use of data    encryption codes in various countries are limiting the    ability of commercial organisations to protect themselves.    Cryptography is at the heart of this dilemma. Governments    all over the world rely on specialist intelligence units to    break down data transmissions from other nations and    individuals while encrypting their own messages.    The US National Security Agency and the UK's Government    Communications HQ are the best-known of these agencies.    The NSA is notorious for obsessive secrecy. Meanwhile, in    the UK, the GCHQ has lifted its traditional reticence in    recent years to offer advice to British companies concerned    with data security.    Mr Roger James, chairman of Cheshire-based communications    software specialist Boldon James, has worked with GCHQ to    define data standards for UK government departments. Mr    James plays down the cloak-and-dagger imagine of GCHQ, but    instead he describes his contact with its staff as    "horribly technical". He also portrays the Cheltenham    code-breakers as "very down-to-earth people".    There are two ways of looking at security, he says "one is    the practical approach, which means accepting that perfect    security is impossible to obtain. The other is the Ivory    Tower approach, which involves dreaming of a world in which    security is absolute. There are a lot of 'practicalists' in    GCHQ".    Mr James, whose clients include the Britannia Building    Society and the German Navy, is active in the European    Electronic Messaging Association. He is concerned at the    lack of a co-ordinated European policy on encryption. And    he fears that effective security measures could become    illegal with the advent of future legislation curbing the    availability of encryption software.    It is illegal at the moment to use strong cryptography    techniques in France without first depositing the key to    unlocking your codes with the French government. UK    companies developing sophisticated security programs find    their software classified as munitions and subject to tight    export restrictions, even within the EC.    In the US, the author of strong encryption program, called    'Pretty Good Privacy', found himself facing a Grand Jury    and possible charges of exporting prohibited technology.    The NSA has proposed that all personal computers made in    the US contain the Clipper Chip. This security feature    would give easy access to any data communications, however    the user chose to encode it. The proposal is currently    stalled, having met with ferocious opposition.    Both suppliers of information technology and industry at    large need to clear a path through this international maze.    The legal structure surrounding the use of encryption    technology is of particular concern to anyone working in    electronic commerce.    "The Clipper Chip debate raised a fundamental moral issue,"    says Mr James. "Software technology means that strong    encryption, previously available only to the military, can    now be obtained by the public. If governments then find    messages hard to break, it leads immediately to a conflict    of interest."    One company that has confronted this apparent conflict of    interest between state and commerce, with its attendant    uncertainty, is the Anglo-Dutch oil giant, Shell. Mr Nick    Mansfield, a Shell technical consultant specialising in    information security, says the company is enthusiastic    about the potential for eliminating paperwork across its    sprawling global operations -- "we are committed to    electronic trading," he says. "We have a vast    electronic-mail network. But there is still a section of    our business where we have to use paper".    Contract agreements are at issue here. Until security can    be absolutely guaranteed, bilateral agreements must be seen    to be tamper-proofed. Shell is about to deploy technology    to secure personal computers and PC servers across the    world. This e-mail security system will cost around L1m in    software purchasing plus L100,000 a year to run. It will    have 4,000 users.    Far from escalating costs, Mr Mansfield explains that    expenses are falling as security improves. Shell used to    run a secure telex network that cost L4m in technology and    required L200,000 a year to support 120 sites. This was    superseded by a secure fax network costing L1m in systems,    plus L100,000 in annual maintenance for 200 sites. The    latest system will expand secure messaging beyond the fax    network's remit.    But setting up this security system involved Shell in a    long and involved process. Its chosen security software is    subject to close scrutiny by the UK authorities, who worked    with Shell to customise the program before it could be    released for use overseas.    While Mr Mansfield is pleased that Shell's security system    is so strong, it required an export licence and he echoes    the concerns of EEMA's Mr James -- "it's a cart and horse    situation. Until governments agree on policy and relax some    restrictions, industry won't be encouraged to development    extreme standards of encryption".    There needs to be a broad European debate on this issue.    Until this complex web of technical, legal and moral    questions are resolved, secure commercial data networks    will be operating under a cloud of uncertainty.    Michael Dempsey    [End]    Note: Shell's Nick Mansfield was a speaker at the OECD    cryptography conference in Paris in December.

Chairman Combest of the House intelligence committee       yesterday proposed making the CIA's DO into a separate       service and splitting the NRO into two giant technical       agencies to handle satellites. The CIA would control       most long-range intelligence work, some of which is now       handled by the CIO and some by the NSA. The biggest       change in terms of size would put the NSA, which has       more than 25,000 analysts, in a new Technical Collection       Agency that would also take in the managerial functions       of NRO and parts of imagery analysis from CIO.    3-5-96.

Rep. Goss,       a former member of the CIA's DO, said the proposal aimed       to rebuild the credibility of the agency's spies: "The       whole exercise we're going through is meant to restore       that."

The Economist, March 2, 1996, pp. 23-25.    What is terrorism?       The use of terror is more widespread and effective than       is generally recognised    June 1914: a young man in Sarajevo steps up to a carriage    and fires his pistol. The Archduke Eerdinand dies. Within    weeks, the first world war has begun. The 1940s: the French    resistance kill occupying troops when and how they can.    June 1944: at Oradour-sur-Glane, in central France, German    SS troops take revenge, massacring 642 villagers. August    1945: the United States Air Eorce drops the world's first    nuclear weapons. Some 190,000 Japanese die, nearly all of    them civilians. Within days the second world war has ended.    Which of these four events was an act of terrorism? Which    achieved anything? Which, if any, will history judge as    justified? And whose history? Terrorism is not the simple,    sharp-edged, bad-guy phenomenon we all love to condemn. No    clear line marks off politics from the threat of force,    threat from use, use from covert or open war. Who is or is    not a terrorist? The suicide bomber, the rebel guerrilla,    the liberation front, the armed forces of the state?    In practice, what act or person earns the label depends on    who wants to apply it. To Ulster loyalists all IRA violence    is terrorism; to Sinn Fein it is part of a legitimate    war.To many Israelis, everyone from the suicidebombers in    Jerusalem or Ashkelon to the Hizbollah grenade-thrower in    South Lebanon is a terrorist; to many Arabs during the 1982    Lebanon war, the worst terrorists in the Middle East were    the -- entirely legitimate, uniformed -- Israel Defence    Force.    If the concept is not to vanish into all-embracing fudge,    two distinctions can be drawn, though habitually they are    not. Terrorism is indeed about terror; not just violence,    but its use to spread terror. And the violence is aimed    specifically at civilians.    Classical terrorism, ideological rather than territorial,    reveals the niceties. Recent decades saw West Germany's    Baader-Meinhof gang and Red Army Faction murder prominent    businessmen such as Alfred Herrhausen and Jurgen Ponto    (bosses of Germany's two largest banks, Deutsche and    Dresdner respectively. Italy's Red Brigades murdered Aldo    Moro, a former prime minister. Its far right in 1980 blew    up a train in Bologna station, killing 84 people. Which of    these was truly terrorism? Arguably, only the last. It was    an act of indiscriminate violence to terrorise citizens at    large; the others were discriminate assassinations to win    publicity and display power.    Likewise, lobbing mortar-bombs into a British army base in    South Armagh may have deadly results, but it is guerrilla    warfare. Planting a bomb that kills a dozen diners in a    restaurant is terrorism. The suicide bomber in Jerusalem    was a terrorist; the Hizbollah fighter in South Lebanon    attacking Israeli army patrols is not.    Even in the distinction between guerrilla warfare and    terrorism, there are grey areas. The soldier in a tank is    a military target. What about one in a jeep escorting    civilian vehicles? Or returning on a bus from leave? A bus    that may -- and was, when a suicide bomber attacked it in    Gaza last April -- be carrying civilians too?    There are, in contrast, distinctions often made that ought    not to be. What is or is not "terrorism" does not depend on    the badness or goodness of the cause, nor on whether those    espousing it have the chance to express their demands    democratically. When President James Garfield was    assassinated in America in the same year, 1881, that a    Russian terrorist group blew up Tsar Alexander II, the    Russians wrote an open letter condemning Garfield's killers    and arguing that:       In a land where the citizens are free to express their       ideas, and where the will of the people does not merely       make the law but appoints the person who is to carry the       law into effect, political assassination is the       manifestation of despotism ... Despotism is always       blameworthy and force can only be justified when       employed to resist force.    Yet despotism does not justify throwing bombs into crowds    (as the group sometimes did).    The fact is that a good cause may use terrorism just as a    bad one may. South Africa has provided a clear example. The    ending of white dominance was a plainly good cause. For the    most part, the African National Congress used mass    demonstrations and industrial sabotage to advance its    cause. But the men who shot up a white church congregation    or planted a bomb outside a cinema were terrorists in the    purest sense of the word.    Nor does the terrorists' ultimate success or failure alter    the truth. Menachem Begin got to lead a country; Yasser    Arafat may do; Velupillai Prabhakaran, who leads the Tamil    Tigers, probably will not. None of that changes the fact    that Deir Yassin (a massacre of Palestinian villagers by    Israelis fighting to establish their state), the killing of    11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972 and this    year's Tamil Tiger bomb in Colombo were all acts of terror.    The terror of the state    So much for the underdogs. Can there be terrorist    governments too? The Americans certainly think so when they    accuse Libya or Iran of supporting international terrorism.    In the cold war, international terrorists were used to wage    war by proxy: the East German regime provided safe houses    for Baaders and Meinhofs; the modern era's most notorious    terrorist, the gun-for-hire Carlos the Jackal, made his    career in this world of state-sponsored terrorism.    All that was diplomacy by terror. Can a recognised    government also be guilty of terrorism against its own    people?    Yes. Stalin used terror systematically to consolidate his    power -- random murders of Communist-Party members and army    officers in the 1930s, massacres and exiles of smaller    ethnic groups throughout his rule. Much of Latin America    practised state terrorism in recent decades. The brasshat    regimes of the day faced left-wing, sometimes terrorist    movements. Many fought back with terror. And not just    through paramilitaries or unacknowledged death squads. The    infamous massacre at El Mozote in El Salvador in 1981 was    the work of that country's regular army. The unit that did    it had a cheerful song of its own,       "Somos Guerreros":       We are warriors,       Warriors all!       We are setting out to kill       A mountain of terrorists.    What in fact they killed was over 500 peasants; probably    the worst "official" massacre in Latin America's recent    history.    Can regular armies, in regular war, be guilty of terrorism?    The answer, surely, is yes. Look at the Japanese rape of    Nanking in 1937, when not hundreds or thousands but ten of    thousands of civilians were murdered, to terrorise the rest    of China. Then go a step further. Can the armies of proud    democracies be guilty too? A century ago, the rich world,    with the rules of war that it claimed to use, would have    called attacking civilians impermissable. The modern world    has other ideas. The Allied bombing of Germany was aimed at    civilians in the hope of shattering morale: in short,    terror. The fire bombing of Tokyo and the atomic weapons    that vaporised Hiroshima and Nagasaki were arguably aimed    at government morale, not that of Japan's population. Their    victims did not notice the difference.    Who kills and how?    What use, one can ask, is a definition so wide that it can    go from Stalin to the American air force? There are two    answers.    First, it is a reminder that terrorism, historically, has    been the tool of the strong, not the weak. Medieval armies,    having taken a besieged town, would slaughter some or all    of the citizens to encourage other towns to surrender    faster. During India's struggle for independence, by far    the worst terror was the Amritsar massacre in 1919, when    British-officered troops shot up a political gathering, and    carried on shooting until the bullets ran out; 379    civilians died (and it worked: the rebellious province of    Punjab returned to order). In contrast, discriminate    assassination was the typical weapon of the 19th-century    anarchist and nihilist.    By and large, true random terrorism has come in the past 30    years, as in the Bologna train bomb, the recent nerve-    gassing of the Tokyo metro by a religious cult, or the    Oklahoma City bomb; all three crimes were aimed at no    matter whom for a purpose so vague or Utopian as to seem    irrelevant, except to the deranged. Even in this period    most -- not all -- IRA killing was aimed at defined    targets: soldiers, policemen, individual Protestant farmers    in border areas. The Basque violence of ETA has often    followed this pattern. Peru's Shining Path guerrillas are    truer terrorists, but even they (mostly) prefer the    tactics, honed by the Vietcong, of killing officials, not    just (as in some infamous massacres) everyone in sight.    Algeria's and Sri Lanka's terrorists today probably have    the strongest claim to be called spreaders of true random    terror.    The second thing one can learn from the wide definition of    terrorism is that the phenomenon is neither uniquely    wicked, nor -- still less -- uniquely deadly. People fight    with the weapons they have: knives, Semtex, rifles,    fighter-bombers. All their users are alike convinced of    their own righteousness, all kill and all their victims are    equally dead. What they are not is equal in number. The    Munich terrorists killed 11 Israelis; Israel's retaliation    against the Lebanese town of Nabatiyeh, however justified,    killed about 100 Arabs. The State Department has totted up    the deaths due to international terrorism from 1968 through    1995. Its total, and it defines terrorism broadly, is    8,700. Twenty-four hours of air raids killed six times as    many civilians at Dresden in 1945. One is a crime, says    international law, the other a legitimate act of war.    The response    Is all this mere word-play? It is not. It crucially affects    responses to terrorism.    One true difference between a terrorist group and a    government is that the group is almost impossible to smash.    You can destroy or seize a government's ability to make    conventional war; you will never get every terrorist's last    stick of dynamite or timing mechanism, and it requires    wonderfully few terrorists to keep a civilised society on    edge.    But many other imagined differences are less great than    they might appear. It is a common error to suppose that    because terrorism is not war, and because its weapons are    not the full panoply of war, then the psychology of    terrorists must be different too. Of course, there are    plenty of curious specimens among terrorism's ranks: Carlos    the Jackal, now in French hands, was not just any old    gunman; or consider Abimael Guzman, an academic who until    his capture in 1992 led Peru's Shining Path movement. Every    terrorist must have personal devotion to the cause -- he    is, after all, risking his liberty, and often his life; not    many reluctant army conscripts, drafted by a legitimate    government, are likely feel the same way. And plainly, say    those who know them, the IRA and other groups include    people who enjoy violence for its own sake.    But so do most armies. And most governments, once at war,    can produce remarkable devotion to the national cause. In    its own terms, a warring terrorist group, like a warring    government, is "pursuing diplomacy by other means", even if    its means of war are different. It too is subject to highs    and lows, to war fatigue and collapses of morale, to    premature celebration of a battle won as if it had been the    war. It too can be threatened with a heavy hand; some of    its members may be wooed with a lighter one.    Terrorists, like governments, may be rational: they are    pursuing a policy they hope will succeed. And the more it    works, the more vigorously they will pursue it.    It is always hard, when terrorism is just one element in a    complex pattern of events, to identify its impact. But the    world is manifestly a different place because of acts of    terror. In 1948, the Israelis blew up the King David hotel,    the administrative centre of the British rulers of    Palestine. The atrocity helped persuade the British to    leave.    Often, terrorists help advance a general cause, but not    their own particular aims. That may be the case with the    IRA. Irish Republican terrorism helped dramatise the    nationalist cause throughout periods of discriminatory    Protestant rule. And Britain has made concessions to the    nationalists. In the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985, the    British accepted the right of the Irish Republic to a say    in a province of the United Kingdom; in the two    governments' Downing Street declaration of 1993 Britain    said it had "no selfish strategic or economic interest in    Northern Ireland". It is hard to imagine any other    government saying such things of its own accord. Yet    whether it was the IRA that brought this about, or    persistent pressure from the Irish government and peaceful    nationalists in the north, is debatable. The leader of the    biggest nationalist party in Northern Ireland, John Hume,    argues that IRA terrorism has been the main obstacle to a    peaceful settlement in Ulster. If so, the IRA may also have    harmed the nationalist cause.    And sometimes, terrorists can advance both a general cause    and themselves. The PLO'S campaigns in the 1970s made the    organisation the dominant representative of the    Palestinians. They also helped solidify the Palestinians'    own sense of their distinct identity, which until then had    been relatively weak.    Just as terrorists make a difference to the world, so    changes in the world make a difference to terrorists. It    was not just their own weakness that led the British to    quit India, or later Cyprus (whose EOKA gunmen, though    damned as terrorists, were more like guerrilla fighters),    or later still Kenya (where they faced a genuinely    terrorist liberation movement). Weakness played its part,    but so did a world view that said colonial empires had had    their day. Much the same was true in South Africa. F.W. de    Klerk, probably the last white president there, may not    have been a more virtuous man than the architects of    apartheid who preceded him. But he was and is a realist,    who lived in different days and under different pressures.    In that case, a just cause plainly helped the terrorists.    For Muslim countries the Palestinian cause was no less    just. Western countries, guiltily aware of the horrors of    Jewish history, disagreed, and it took 20 years of Israeli    occupation and the intifada, the Palestinian uprising of    1987-90, to persuade them that the PLO too had a case. It    is still not one that much impresses Americans; and though    other westerners may have sympathy with Palestinian dreams    of statehood, any movement that still seeks a quite    different thing, the destruction of Israel, on top will --    very rightly -- find that its bombers face a western world    united behind the Jewish state.    Like the rest of us -- mostly    In all this, what is different about dealing with    terrorism? The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is not very    much.    Any government has its own interests, its own pressures,    its concessions it can make and those it cannot. It fights    its conventional wars with tanks and aircraft, its    small-scale wars -- partly terrorist, mostly not -- with    intelligence men and small arms. It cannot, usually, zap    the terrorists' territory as it could that of a hostile    state. But its psychology will be much the same in the two    cases -- and so will that of its enemies. The terrorist or    suicide bomber or gunman or fighter or liberation hero is    not different from other men (men, sic; rarely have women    played any notable part, any more than they have in    old-fashioned war).    With one notable exception: the nutters, whether with a    cause or no evident cause at all. The American way-out    redneck who thinks he has to plant a bomb, when he could    vote for Pat Buchanan, is beyond any but a psychiatrist's    reach. So too elitist solipsists like the Baader-Meinhof    mob, convinced that murder was justified because they knew    all the answers and it was society that was out of step.    Among the almost causeless, Italy's far right may have    sought instability, but for what? That was never clear. And    no known concession could have led Japan's Aum Shinrikyo    cult to put aside its chemistry set.    Is it coincidence that three of these four groups seem to    specialise in the true terrorism, the random murder of    civilians for terror's sake? Perhaps it is not.

      itself conducted the Oklahoma City bombing to create an
      excuse for further depriving citizens of their
      constitutional rights. A continuing flow of information

The Washington Post, March 11, 1996, p. A18.
   Security and Software [Editorial]
   The number of computer users continues to grow, but use of
   the Internet for business and financial transactions isn't
   keeping pace. At least, that's the complaint of many who
   expected a flood of Americans to go on-line for banking,
   publishing and mail-ordering -- with tremendous profits to
   the on-line industries that handle these services. One big
   reason for the lag is customer concern about the safety of
   information, from credit-card numbers to bank balances and
   business secrets, in the hacker-rich environment of the
   Internet -- an eminently reasonable concern that many in
   the industry believe can be addressed only by the wider use
   and availability of sophisticated "encryption software,"
   which scrambles information en route, making it
   indecipherable to anyone who doesn't hold the key to the
   code.
   The sense that encryption technology holds the key to
   future economic growth on the Internet is pushing an arcane
   but intense argument between the Clinton administration and
   the computer industry over whether to lift existing
   restrictions on the export of the most powerful encryption
   software. The administration, especially its law
   enforcement agencies, bars on national security grounds the
   export of encryption software above a certain difficulty
   level, saying that it needs to be able, if neqessary, to
   seek and obtain the equivalent of a permit to wiretap. The
   makers of the software argue that these restrictions are
   ruinous for U.S. competitiveness in the international
   market because foreign customers want the most secure
   encryption available. Some civil liberties organizations
   argue that the restrictions are an invasion of customers'
   privacy rights.
   Legislation introduced this month in both the House and the
   Senate would ease the export restrictions while attempting
   to meet some of the government's security concerns. Code
   makers would deposit a "spare key" to any exported
   encryption software with a trusted third-party agency -- a
   compromise the Justice Department and national security
   agencies also have been pursuing in talks with the
   industry, but at which the industry hesitates because it
   fears that the existence of "spare keys lying around" would
   cause potential customers to balk. (The Justice Department
   also would like a spare-key agreement for encryption
   software sold domestically, but has less leverage because
   such sales require no license.)
   The legislation would heavily penalize any "key holder"
   agency that provides an unauthorized copy to anyone besides
   the government. But it also would make it legal to export
   any encryption technology that is already "generally
   available" -- for instance, in stores or on domestic
   computer bulletin boards.
   Such a sweeping change, law enforcement authorities fear,
   could render the other barriers and safeguards in the bill
   close to academic in the borderless, lightning-quick world
   of Internet transmission. Once it's widely available
   overseas, "uncrackable" software or hardware can't be
   recalled. The U.S. intelligence agencies with their
   superior computing power can still crack most coded
   software, if not immediately, then much faster than 99.9
   percent of ordinary commercial hackers. But that doesn't
   mean their concerns should be shrugged off. Like arms
   sales, encryption technology sales have implications for
   traditional national security interests as well as the
   economic kind. The urgent interest both sides share is to
   get this resolved soon.

         _________________________________________________________
   Introduction [Excerpts]
   The Dutch Data Protection Authority (the Registratiekamer)
   and the Information and Privacy Commissioner for the
   Province of Ontario, Canada (IPC) are both privacy
   protection agencies that oversee compliance with their
   respective juridiction's privacy laws. The Registratiekamer
   and IPC decided to pool their resources and collaborate in
   the production of a report exploring privacy technologies
   that permit transactions to be conducted anonymously. The
   first international paper of this type includes a survey of
   companies that might be expected to offer such
   technologies, and organizations that might use them.
   In addition to anonymous transactions, the range of
   security features commercially available for use and the
   types of services actually being used by various
   organizations were also examined (see 2.1 Survey
   methodology). The Registratiekamer and IPC felt that a
   joint report outlining the practices followed in their
   respective jurisdictions would shed some light on this
   little-studied but extremely important area where the
   future of privacy-protection in an electronic world may
   lie.
   Consumer polls have repeatedly shown that individuals value
   their privacy and are concerned with its potential loss
   when so much of their personal information is routinely
   stored in computer databases, over which they have no
   control. Protecting one's identity goes hand in hand with
   preserving one's ability to remain *anonymous* -- a key
   component of privacy. While advances in information and
   communications technology have fuelled the ability of
   organizations to keep massive amounts of personal data,
   this has increasingly jeopardized the privacy of those
   whose information is being collected. Minimizing
   identifying data would restore privacy considerably, but
   would still permit the collection of needed information.
   When assessing the need for identifiable data during the
   course of a transaction, the key question one must start
   with is: how much personal information/data is truly
   required for the proper functioning of the information
   system involving this transaction? This question must also
   be asked at the outset -- prior to the design and
   development of any new system. But this is not the case
   today.
   This question is rarely asked at all since there is such a
   clear preference in favour of collection identifiable data,
   'the more the better'. However, with the growth of
   networked communications and the ability to link a wide
   number of diverse databases electronically, people will
   become more and more reluctant to leave behind a trail of
   identifiable data. What is needed is a paradigm shift away
   from a 'more is better' mindset to a minimalist one. Is it
   possible to minimize the amount of identifiable data
   presently collected and stored in information systems, but
   still meet the needs of those collecting the information?
   We believe that it is.
   The technology needed to achieve this goal exists today. We
   will describe some of the privacy technologies that permit
   one to engage in transactions without revealing one's
   identity by introducing the concept of an *identity
   protector*. The notion of *pseudonymity* will also be
   introduced as an integral part of protecting one's
   identity. These technologies are available now and within
   our reach; what is needed is the will to implement privacy
   technologies over the tracking technologies that are in use
   today.
   When organizations are asked what measures they have in
   place to protect privacy, they usually point to their
   efforts at keeping information secure. While the use of
   security measures to prevent unauthorized access to
   personal data is a very important component of privacy, it
   does not equal privacy protection. The latter is a much
   broader concept which starts with the questioning of the
   initial collection of the information to ensure there is a
   good reason for doing so and that its uses will be
   restricted to legitimate ones that the data subject has
   been advised of. Once the data has been collected, security
   and confidentiality become paramount. Effective security
   and confidentiality will depend on the implementation of
   measures to create a secure environment.
   Alternatively, instead of restricting the focus to security
   alone, a more comprehensive approach would be to seek out
   ways in which technology may be used to enhance the
   protection of informational privacy or data protection. We
   use the term *privacy technologies* to refer to a variety
   of technologies that safeguard personal privacy by
   minimizing or eliminating the collection of identifiable
   data.
   Not only are measures that safeguard privacy becoming an
   important mark of quality, but increasingly, consumers are
   demanding that organizations pay attention to their privacy
   concerns. Social acceptance of demands for one's personal
   information, without adequate assurances of protection,
   appears to be on the decline. Not only do consumers wish to
   maintain control over their personal data and be informed
   of its uses, but insufficient protection will be reason
   enough for consumers to take their business elsewhere -- to
   companies that follow privacy-protective practices.

   "Beyond the Last Theorem."
   On Diophantine equations, by mathematician Dorian Goldfeld.
      To mathematicians, the statement and proof of the STW
      conjecture were as revolutionary as the first mingling
      of waters in the Panama Canal. Until that point, the
      mathematics of elliptic functions and the mathematics of
      rigid motions had developed in isolation from each other
      and in strikingly different ways. The study of elliptic
      curves was a branch of number theory, small, specialized
      and provincial -- not unlike the study of Diophantine
      equations. In contrast, the study of rigid motions was
      a bustling, sophisticated suburb of topology, geometry
      and analysis, with many applications to engineering and
      physics. Mathematicians had been working on rigid
      motions intensely for a hundred years and had
      accumulated a vast armamentarium of powerful
      mathematical machinery. By suggesting that the two
      fields could be linked, Shimura, Taniyama and Weil
      delivered that heavy machinery to the construction site
      of elliptic curves; by proving that the link held, Wiles
      and Taylor started the engines. The result has been a
      frenzy of productive mathematical work that has
      benefited each field and is likely to lead to solutions
      of outstanding problems in other fields as well. ...
      If the ABC conjecture yields, mathematicians will find
      themselves staring into a cornucopia of solutions to
      long-standing problems. Some of those problems are of
      more than theoretical interest. Nowadays many methods of
      ensuring the security of electronic mail and other
      computerized transactions depend heavily on number
      theory, as programmers develop ciphers based on
      time-consuming problems in arithmetic. For example, a
      highly popular technique depends on the difficulty of
      determining all the large prime factors of a very large
      number.
      In principle, it should also be straightforward to
      create a cipher based on the difficulty of solving
      problems in Diophantine analysis. The major hurdle is
      the solvability barrier: the number of variables above
      which a Diophantine equation becomes impervious to
      attack. Any cipher based on an equation with that many
      variables should be absolutely secure. But where is the
      threshold? All anyone knows is that it probably lies
      between three and nine variables. At current or
      foreseeable processing speeds, a nine-variable cipher is
      impracticably slow, even for the fastest computers. A
      four-variable Diophantine cipher, however, would be both
      practical and extremely useful.

   In "America's Information Edge," Joseph S. Nye, Jr.  former
   Chairman of the National Intelligence Council and Assistant
   Secretary of Defense, and Admiral William A. Owen, former
   Vice Chairman of the JCS, argue that information technology
   is transforming knowledge, and thereby power. They write of
   a "system of systems, an integration of ISR, C4I and
   precision force, which represents a qualitative change in
   U.S. military capabilities." They envision informational
   "soft power" -- the ability to achieve outcomes in
   international affairs through attraction rather than
   coercion -- as reinforcing the "information umbrella"
   shielding allies in lieu of the nuclear option.
   In "A Revolution in Warfare," Eliot A. Cohen, Professor of
   Strategic Studies at Johns Hopkins, takes issue with Nye
   and Owen on the radical impact of information technology,
   and argues that its revolutionary dazzle may distort
   historical understanding of the more general political and
   economic forces that are reshaping international and
   military affairs. He observes that misunderstanding of
   revolutionary technology all too often has had unexpected,
   disastrous, consequences: "A revolution in military affairs
   is under way. It will require changes of a magnitude that
   military people still do not completely grasp and political
   leaders do not fully imagine."

   The key issue for the Net is not smut, it is the use of
   encryption
      Growing fears that Big Brother might decide to read your
      E-mail.
   By Denise Caruso
   The current uproar over the Internet is about smut and what
   can be made public on the global computer network. But the
   next public-policy tangle will be about what we're allowed
   to keep secret.
   Earlier this month, a bipartisan group from both houses of
   Congress introduced versions of legislation called the
   Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996. This bill,
   which outlines the proper use of encryption technologies
   for privacy and security, is by far the most critical piece
   of Internet legislation yet introduced.
   Encryption uses a mathematical key to scramble and
   unscramble digital messages so they can be read only by
   their intended recipients and not by human or electronic
   snoopers. Legislation about this powerful technology is
   especially important when viewed in light of two laws
   already on the books.
   One of these, the Digital Telephony Act, signed into law in
   1994, allows Federal law-enforcement agencies to update the
   telephone network with the most pervasive surveillance
   equipment in history.
   The other, the freshly signed Communications Decency Act,
   bans "indecent" material from the Internet. It is a law
   that many legislators seemed to feel was on shaky ground
   even as Congress was passing it. A constitutional challenge
   to the law is currently being heard in Federal District
   Court in Philadelphia.
   Though the encryption bill as written is receiving
   qualified support from industry and civil libertarians,
   some worry that changes made in committee could make the
   bill too restrictive, completing a triumvirate of Big
   Brother legislation that would give law enforcement the
   ability and rationale to monitor all the electronic
   messages of citizens, leaving little or no recourse for
   private or secure communication.
   Such restrictions threaten to suffocate the Internet. As
   new users and businesses flock daily to the Internet, their
   need to protect confidential business data and messages
   becomes a key issue in making the Net safe enough to be
   useful. Computer security experts say that many of today's
   problems on the Net -- minors getting access to
   pornography, security breaches of corporate data, the need
   to prove one's identity -- could be solved by using
   encryption.
   Today, using encryption of any kind is still perfectly
   legal inside the United States. Historically, it was mostly
   used to protect secret military communications, so the
   technology is still classified as munitions -- the same
   threat to national security as a boatload of artillery
   shells. Thus any products containing encryption are subject
   to strict export controls.
   Law-enforcement and national security officials say that
   widespread use of strong encryption would enable terrorists
   and organized-crime syndicates to communicate with
   impunity. They say export control is the only way to keep
   this genie in its bottle, at least when it comes to
   foreign, not domestic crime.
   In addition, security experts have persuaded the Clinton
   Administration to propose an encryption method called "key
   escrow" that would give the Government access to
   information even after it had been encrypted. Key-escrow
   systems generate a decrypting key that is held by a trusted
   third party. When law-enforcement agents show up with a
   court warrant, the trustee hands over the key to unlock the
   message.
   So far, the Clinton Administration's proposals, which
   include a key-escrow system called Clipper have been
   universally reviled by both civil libertarians and the
   computer industry, which claims it stands to be deprived of
   up to $60 billion annually by the year 2000 because of
   export controls. They argue that any country today can make
   and sell encryption products stronger than what can be
   legally exported from the United States and that people
   won't use a system like key escrow because it has a
   built-in security compromise.
   One defender of key-escrow policy is Dorothy Denning, a
   professor of computer science at Georgetown University and
   a consultant to the military industry. She argued in a
   letter to Senator Patrick J. Leahy Democrat of Vermont --
   one of the sponsors of the new legislation -- that such a
   system was vital to public safety and security.
   James Barksdale, president of the Netscape Communications
   Corporation, whose popular Web-browser software has
   built-in encryption capabilities, called Ms. Denning's
   solution a "stopgap measure."
   "Key escrow is an unworkable idea, and we do not support
   it," Mr. Barksdale said. "Key escrow will be defeated just
   like Prohibition was defeated by bathtub gin -- all it took
   was a big bag of sugar and a long weekend."
   Policy watchdogs like the Center for Democracy and
   Technology and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, both
   outspoken advocates for privacy rights and due process,
   agree that the bill is headed in the right direction. It
   does not dictate the use of a key escrow system, eases
   export controls for "mass market" products (like
   Netscape's), prohibits any restriction on the domestic use
   or sale of encryption, and provides a "personal use" policy
   for American travelers who use encryption while outside the
   country.
   But the bill is sure to face a fight as it moves through
   the House and the Senate, and the key-escrow and
   export-control proponents marshal their experts.
   David Farber, a professor of computer science at the
   University of Pennsylvania and a board member of the
   Electronic Frontier Foundation, says encryption policy
   always turns into "a religious discussion" between those
   who fear terrorism and those who want to live without fear
   of constant surveillance.
   But, he adds, if you take privacy discussions to the
   people, their attitudes are pretty clear. " If you ask the
   American public what they think of national I.D. cards, for
   example, a huge percentage are opposed to them," he said.
   "Why? They're not hiding anything. They just don't want the
   Government to have that type of power."

Wall Street Journal, March 26, 1996, p. B4.
   Researchers Find Big Security Flaw In Java Language
   By Don Clark
   A team of Princeton University researchers said they
   discovered the most serious security flaw yet in the widely
   used Java programming language from Sun Microsystems Inc.
   The flaw could make it possible for unscrupulous hackers to
   destroy files or cause other types of damage on any
   personal computer that uses Netscape Communications Corp.'s
   Navigator program, said Edward Felten, a Princeton
   assistant professor of computer science who helped discover
   the flaw.
   Netscape Navigator, which uses Java, is the most popular
   software for browsing the Internet's World Wide Web. Java
   enables the creation of tiny programs, called applets, that
   are transferred from a Web site on the Internet to a PC
   running Netscape Navigator.
   Mr. Felten said that unscrupulous people who discovered the
   flaw could boobytrap a Web page on the Internet,
   essentially seizing control of the browser software of any
   PC that tapped into that page. At that point, the hackers
   could read or delete an entire hard disk of data files.
   "The consequences of this flaw are as bad as they can be,"
   he said.
   Sun, a computer maker based in Mountain View, Calif.,
   acknowledged the problem. "This one is a serious bug," said
   Marianne Mueller, a senior Sun engineer specializing in
   security issues.
   The company, alerted by Princeton on Friday, is already
   testing a software fix it has developed for the program and
   hopes to distribute it to Netscape and other users in about
   two days. Those companies are then expected to distribute
   updated versions of their Web browsers or other products to
   users.
   "We plan to fix it and get it out to our customers as fast
   as we can," said Jeff Treuhaft, a Netscape product manager.
   Java was originally touted by Sun as a secure language. But
   at least two other flaws have already been discovered in
   the technology, including a less-serious problem uncovered
   by the Princeton team last month. Sun's Ms. Mueller said
   the problems have been correctable details in the way the
   Java code is written, not problems with its basic design.

   "Sold Out." By James Boyle, American University law
   professor
      We are in the middle of an information land grab and no
      one seems to have noticed. Congress is now considering
      the Administration's proposal for intellectual property
      on the Internet, aimed at "saving" this thriving medium.
      Using a far-fetched theory of what constitutes
      "copying," the proposal would turn browsing an Internet
      document into a copyright violation. It would
      effectively privatize much of the public domain by
      transforming the current law of fair use. It would make
      on-line service providers strictly liable for their
      customers' copyright violations, thus giving providers
      an incentive to monitor what you do in cyberspace.
      "Poetry can only be made out of other poems, novels out
      of other novels," as the critic Northrop Frye famously
      put it. The same goes for computer programs, which build
      on the contributions of earlier hackers. Every
      intellectual property claim is a chunk taken out of the
      public domain. If we give someone a software patent over
      basic functions, at some point the public domain will be
      so diminished that future creators will be prevented
      from creating because they won't be able to afford the
      raw materials they need. An intellectual property system
      has to insure that the fertile public domain is not
      converted into a fallow landscape of walled private
      plots.

DoJ is probably cutting spying-sensitive Harvard some slack, or slyly crowing about setting up the Crimson butts with a promise for deniability. Is it possible that the CFP chit-chat revved that Janus-spin, practicing for more pervasive cyber-sleuth slathering of wannabe L&O insiders?

   First Internet Wiretap Leads to a Suspect
   [Excerpts of story not in the TWP]
   Stephen P. Heymann, a Federal prosecutor in Boston, said
   investigators had worked with Harvard to determine a method
   of tracking the suspect that would protect the privacy of
   legitimate users.
   He said that the Harvard system had 16,500 accounts and
   13,000 users and that about 60,000 E-mail messages each day
   moved in and out of the area where investigators were
   looking for the intruder.
   Mr. Heymann said investigators had used a high-speed
   computer to check for 10 to 15 key words that matched the
   intruder's profile. If they were not sure if an electronic
   communication containing a key word was Mr. Ardita's, the
   investigators looked at 80 characters on either side of the
   key word to make that determination. Mr. Heymann said
   investigators believed that only twice had they read a
   complete message that was not Mr. Ardita's.

   "Businesses fail to halt 'Ram raiders.'
      A sprialling crime wave is causing growing concern among
      law enforcement authorities, insurers and the business
      community. Computer theft is the fastest-growing crime
      in the UK. To combat physical computer crime, a wide
      variety of protection measures have been developed:
      physical restraints, motion detectors, electronic
      tagging, dye sprays, invisible identity tags, microdots,
      smoke bombs, chemical "fingerprints," and software
      monitors. Beyond the threats of hacking and virus
      attacks, as much as 2bn pounds a year is lost by
      computer misuse and "time-wasting surfing the Internet".
      Some of the new-anti-theft products are on display at
      Infosec 96, the UK's first big IT security exhibition,
      at London Olympia this week. The organisers have
      prepared seven fact sheets dealing with security "hot

@_subject: EET on PGP API Quash 
[Thanks to BC]
   Electronic Engineering Times, April 29, 1996, page 4
   State Dept. Tries To Quash API's for PGP cryptography
   By Loring Wirbel
   Washington -- The Justice Department may have halted
   attempts to bring criminal charges against Phil Zimmermann,
   author of the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) public-key
   cryptography algorithms, but the State Department is taking
   an increasingly hard line on PGP. Where once the State had
   restricted itself to warning developers against exporting
   source code with PGP file-encryption routines, it is now
   arguing that application programming interfaces (API)
   allowing PGP program insertion should be subject to control
   under arms-trading statutes.
   Warning letters sent out in the last few weeks reflect the
   bizarre status of cryptography algorithms in the
   government's Export Control Act. Under the International
   Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) promulgated under the
   act, the government can restrict any encryption programs
   the National Security Agency (NSA) is uncomfortable with.
   The new moves represent the first time State has tried to
   extend ITAR to software that only provides hooks for
   encryption packages, however.
   "There is some room to maneuver and make strong arguments
   that the rules on crypto APIs have some serious
   ambiquities," said Kenneth Bass, an attorney specializing
   in export control with the Washington law firm of Venable
   Attorneys at Law. Bass said several companies have received
   warning letters from State, but most do not want to do
   battle with the Federal government.
   Meanwhile, wildly differing rulings in the U.S. District
   Courts on the West and East coasts send mixed messages
   about software embedding crypto algorithms. In refusing to
   dismiss developer Daniel Bernstein's suit against the State
   Department, Judge Marilyn Hall Patel of San Francisco ruled
   in early April that source code can be protected free
   speech.
   "The particular language one chooses  does not  change the
   nature of the language for First Amendment purposes," Patel
   said. "This court can find no meaningful difference between
   computer languages ... and German or French; ... whether
   source code or object code is also functional is
   immaterial." Bernstein seeks to establish that his
   zero-delay private-key program, Snuffle, is not subject to
   ITAR.
   Opposite Rationale
   But on March 22, Judge Charles Richey of Washington
   dismissed Philip Karn's suit against State using almost
   exactly the opposite rationale. Karn, an employee of
   Qualcomm Inc. (San Diego), challenged a ruling that the
   floppy disks accompanying some editions of Bruce Schneier's
   book, *Applied Cryptography*, could be barred from export.
   Judge Richey said the government was free to view
   implemented source code as a munition that could be banned,
   and said Defense Department decisions regarding materials
   covered under export control were precluded from judicial
   review. Karn appealed to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
   on April 19. "The stage is being set for some very basic
   issues on souce code and free speech to be decided," said
   attorney Bass.
   So far the API issue has not spurred any suits. Network
   Telesystems Inc. (Santa Clara, Calif.) a TCP/IP stack
   specialist and the one company that has admitted receiving
   a warning from State, said that a PGP API is not central
   enough to its business to warrant making its preservation
   a federal case.
   Company president John Davidson said Network Telesystems
   elected to make its new e-mail package, Confidante, "PGP
   ready" by including a PGP API instead of licensing the
   code. Davidson said the warning must have been the result
   of government officials seeing the press release on the
   package, which has not yet shipped, or a short article in
   a national magazine.
   "We thought it was a misunderstanding at first, since we
   had no resident PGP code," Davidson said. "It didn't seem
   possible that the government could really be talking about
   an interface."
   One computer-security expert said off the record that "NSA
   has told State to watch out for any APIs outside NSA's own
   effort to define a crypto API." NSA is embracing the API
   work of companies like RSA Data Security Inc., the source
   said, "but Zimmermann's PGP work has always been a
   freelance effort, so a compromise is not seen as
   necessary."

@_subject: Dole Backs Crypto Export 
Financial Times, May 3, 1996, p. 7.
   Dole backs removal of software export ban
   By Louise Kehoe in San Francisco
   Senator Bob Dole, the presumptive Republican presidential
   candidate, yesterday threw his support behind proposed
   legislation to remove US export restrictions on computer
   software used to encode Internet messages.
   The new Security and Freedom through Encryption bill
   introduced yesterday by several Republican senators and
   congressmen, also rejects a controversial Clinton
   administration proposal to enable law enforcement agencies
   to unlock encoded electronic messages.
   For Senator Dole, the encryption bill provides an
   opportunity to seek support from Silicon Valley high-tech
   leaders many of whom backed Mr Bill Clinton in 1992, and to
   boost his election campaign efforts in California.
   "The administration's misguided proposal on encryption
   amounts to a pair of cement shoes for Silicon Valley," said
   Senator Dole. "It seems to me that a new pair of track
   shoes might be a better answer. The administration's big
   brother proposal will literally destroy America's computer
   industry," he said.
   Encryption software is currently classified as "munitions"
   and exports are strictly limited by the US state
   department. US and other western intelligence and law
   enforcement agencies are opposed to the commercial use of
   the most powerful encryption methods which they argue could
   be used to mask criminal or terrorist activities by
   effectively preventing wire-taps.
   However, US software companies maintain that the current
   export restrictions threaten US pre-eminence in the world
   software market.
   A study by the Computer Systems Policy Project, a computer
   industry group, estimated that within four years the US
   economy would lose $60bn in revenues and roughly 216,000
   jobs as a result of encryption export controls.
   Moreover, current regulations, which allow export only of
   "weak" encryption, are unacceptable because such encoding
   has been demonstrated to be ineffective.
   Last year, for example students in France were able to
   break encryption which is used in the export version of
   Netscape Communication's popular Internet browser software.
   The limited availability of strong encryption software is
   also blocking the progress of electronic commerce on the
   Internet, US computer experts argue, because companies and
   individuals are reluctant to make electronic payments over
   the Internet without assurance of security.

May-June, 1996, Harvard Business Review. Two related    articles which examine c'punks interests -- proposed    business regulation of the Net; on-line security;    copyright; encryption; authentication; E-cash; electronic    commerce; protected communities to escape "frontier    anarchy."    Executive summaries by HBR:    "Ruling the Net." Debora Spar and Jeffrey J. Bussgang    The Internet promises a radical new world of business. But    for many companies, it has yet to deliver. Although doing    business in cyberspace may be novel and exhilarating, it    can also be frustrating, confusing, and even unprofitable.    Debora Spar and Jeffrey Bussgang argue that the problems    companies face have little to do with a lack of technology    or imagination. Their problems stem instead from a lack of    rules. Without the order that rules create, business cannot    be conducted.    The authors explain why the informal rules that have    developed on the Internet since the 1960s are no longer    sufficient. Businesses thinking of allowing millions of    dollars of transactions to occur on the wide-open Net need    specific assurances. They require clear definitions of    property rights, a safe and useful means of exchange, and    a way to locate and punish violators of on-line rules.    The authors believe that the key to commerce on the    Internet lies in the creation of managed on-line    communities. Such communities can be formed by service    providers -- entities that will restrict on-line options,    fine-tune offerings to match a select group of users, and    provide some means of recourse in cases of fraud or abuse.    Under those conditions, they will draw new companies    on-line and increase the productivity of those already    there. And, say the authors, the rewards for service    providers will be substantial: Companies that make the    rules on the Internet's emerging frontier have the    opportunity to reap the greatest profits. [40 kb]    "The Real Value of On-Line Communities." Arthur Armstrong    and John Hagel III    The notion of community has been at the heart of the    Internet since its early days, when scientists used it to    share data, collaborate on research, and exchange messages.    But how can businesses best use its community-building    capabilities? Not merely by putting their products or    services on-line, the authors contend. Real value will come    from providing people with the ability to interact with one    another -- from satisfying their multiple social needs as    well as their commercial needs. Companies that create    strong on-line communities will command customer loyalty to    a degree hitherto undreamed of and, consequently, will    generate strong economic returns.    The authors present four different types of community:    communities of transaction, interest, fantasy, and    relationship. Examples of each type already can be found on    the Internet or through on-line services, but the    successful community of the future will incorporate all    four -- or as many as possible. As for economic value, the    authors see four ways for a company to generate returns:    through usage fees, content fees, transactions and    advertising, and synergies with other parts of its    business.    In the near future, new business definitions may emerge    around the notion of owning a specific customer segment    across the full range of its interests and needs; owning    specific products and services may no longer be so    important. The authors urge businesses marketing to    consumers to make the small investment required to "buy an    option" on electronic communities in order to understand    both their potential value and the radical changes they may    cause.

@_subject: NYT on Netscape Flaw 
The New York Times, May 18, 1996, pp. 31, 43.    New Netscape Software Flaw Is Discovered    By John Markoff    Computer science researchers at Princeton University said    yesterday that they had discovered a new and potentially    serious flaw in the Netscape Communicatlons Corporation's    Navigator software, the leading program used to browse the    World Wide Web of the Internet.    The flaw, which was found in recent versions of the    Netscape software that support Sun Microsystems' Java    programming language, could allow people to write    destructive or malicious programs and potentially destroy    or steal data or otherwise tamper with a computer that was    connected to the Internet and used the Navigator program.    Netscape executives said that the researchers had been in    touch with them about the problem on Thursday and that the    software company was in the process of producing a new    version of the Navigator program that would protect against    potential attacks.    This is the third flaw in the Navigator program discovered    in recent months by the Princeton group. Netscape has been    under tremendous scrutiny over the security of its popular    software since the fall, when a group of researchers at the    University of California at Berkeley discovered a flaw in    the Netscape security system.    In the most recent case, Thomas Cargill, an independent    software consultant working with the Princeton group,    discovered a problem in the way Netscape has used the Java    language in its Navigator program. The group disclosed a    similar flaw in March in the Netscape Navigator that would    permit a Java program to run illicitly on a computer that    was running the Netscape program and perform damaging    operations.    "Netscape has fixed a series of problems, and the overall    security of their system has improved, but there is still    some reason for concern," said Prof. Edward Felton, the    leader of the Princeton group, which includes two graduate    students, Drew Dean and Dean Wallach.    Programs that are known as viruses and worms are a serious    threat to computer networks because they can move from    machine to machine quickly, carrying out destructive    applications. Sun Microsystems' Java language has been    designed to limit what a virus can do once it is    transferred across the Internet. But the security    mechanisms only work if the virus's code can be restricted    in a safety "box" constructed out of software.    Netscape's executives acknowledged yesterday that the    Princeton University team had on both occasions been able    to find doors that let program code out of the safety box.    "We're trying to create a sandbox which has rooms where    only certain things happen," said Jeff Trehaft, Netscape's    director of security. "What happened is that the Princeton    team found a door and it turned out that there weren't    adequate protections surrounding the door."    The company said it was in the process of posting on the    Internet a new version of the most recent test version of    its next-generation Internet program, version 3.0 beta. The    program contains a special fix to prevent the new attack.    He said Netscape had not yet posted a fix for the most    recent commercial release of its software, version 2.02,    but was instead encouraging customers to use the 3.0 beta    software.    Since the Berkeley researchers discovered the first    security flaw the company has offered a $1,000 "bugs    bounty" to programmers who are able to locate security    flaws.    [End]

Companies that create    strong on-line communities will command customer loyalty to    a degree hitherto undreamed of and, consequently, will    generate strong economic returns.    The authors present four different types of community:    communities of transaction, interest, fantasy, and    relationship. Examples of each type already can be found on    the Internet or through on-line services, but the    successful community of the future will incorporate all    four -- or as many as possible. As for economic value, the    authors see four ways for a company to generate returns:    through usage fees, content fees, transactions and    advertising, and synergies with other parts of its    business.    In the near future, new business definitions may emerge    around the notion of owning a specific customer segment    across the full range of its interests and needs; owning    specific products and services may no longer be so    important. The authors urge businesses marketing to    consumers to make the small investment required to "buy an    option" on electronic communities in order to understand    both their potential value and the radical changes they may    cause.

5-19-96. WaPo:    "From Out Of the Shadows." Book review.    Spies Without Cloaks: The KGB's Successors    By Amy Knight    Princeton University Press. 318 pp. $24.95       Knight suggests that Russia's new security forces are       not only continuing the same kinds of skulduggery as       they undertook in the past but are now also expertly       manipulating public opinion in Russia and the rest of       the world to obscure and disguise what they do.       What Knight suggests is that the old client-master       relationship between Russia's elite and the KGB has not       only been reversed but may even have vanished, because       these "children of the KGB" have subsumed large chunks       of Russia's economy and government.       If *Spies Without Cloaks* is correct, much of Russia       today is little more than a mutant KGB, the communist       ideology it once served now replaced by ruthless       devotion to great-power politics and bottom-line       capitalism.    The book is worth reading for its applicability to the    transformation of the US and international intelligence    "communities" into free-market racketeering of espionage    technologies and expertise and insider secrets -- as WaPo    reported May 2 on high-tech intel patrons Perry and Deutch.

McConnell [Initials]           Edward J. Appel [Initials]           Co-Chairs, Interagency Working Group on           Cryptography Policy      Attached for your review and comment is a draft paper entitled "Enabling Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public Safety in the Global Information Infrastructure." It presents a vision and course of action for developing a cryptographic infrastructure that will protect valuable information on national and international networks.      The draft paper is the result of the many discussions we have had with interested parties concerning the use of encryption. While those discussions have explored the use of both key recoverable encryption and non-recoverable encryption, the draft paper addresses an infrastructure which uses key recoverable encryption. We believe such a key management infrastructure, voluntary and supported by *private sector* key management organizations, is the prospect of the near future. It would permit users and manufacturers free choice of encryption algorithm, facilitate international interoperability, preserve law enforcement access, and, most importantly, provide strong system security and integrity.      Recognizing that a robust infrastructure is not yet a reality, we are also considering measures to liberalize export policy for some non-escrowed products. Appendix II of the draft paper begins to summarize current policy, and we intend to expand and improve that section.      We believe that clearly articulating such a vision will accelerate the ability of the United States to realize the full advantages of the global network for commerce, security and public safety. However, such a vision cannot become a reality unless it is widely shared. Therefore, rather than being a finished product, the attached paper is a draft which we ask you to help us improve. We hope it will contribute to constructive discussion and promote a clearer understanding of each others' needs and concerns regarding the use of encryption.      We welcome your comments and look forward to further discussion. Written comments may be sent to our attention, Room 10236, NEOB, Washington, D.C. 20503. ____________________________________________________________

5-23-96. WaJo:    "Chasing Criminals at Cyberspeed."       Three recent developments in the money laundering trade       have governments especially worried: the proliferation       of offshore financial centers, the collapse of the       Soviet Union and the adaptation of emerging technologies       to criminal ends. Officials think newly developed "smart       cards" will be particularly appealing to criminals.       Smart cards could be used to download cash from bank       accounts, then used to make payments or deposits       anywhere in the world. All without anyone knowing who       holds the smart card, because encryption guarantees       anonymity.       Says Stanley Morris, director of FinCEN, "The only way       we can adequately assist our federal law enforcement       counterparts in following the trail of the multinational       money launderer is through our linkages with       multilateral arrangements such as ...

Peter Cassidy, an esteemed subscriber here, is the Wired author Tim notes,
who reports on the Bernstein case in the June issue. A well-written piece
with several thought-provokings in addition to those cited by Tim. Peter writes of Judge Marilyn Hall Patel on the Bernstein case: "Before the case is resolved, Patel's skepticism of the state's perogatives
will be tested to the limit when the government is called upon to defend
its policy. Patel is then likely to be given the *in camera* presentation
of The Deepest Darkest Secrets of Cryptography -- probably a modified
version of the classifed briefing the NSA has used with great success to
influence members of Congress. Legend has it that no one who ever got 'the

subject    Several news reports in the last few days seem to be aiming    at raising the alarm about crypto, perhaps in response to    the various crypto bills, administration reformulations,    and studies such as that headed by Herb Lin.    The recycling of the news of DoD break-ins supposedly due    to heavy military reliance on the Internet; the drumbeat of    conferences, press releases and planted stories on    international money laundering, the hazards of E-money to    the stability of the banking system, spreading "Russian"    criminality, and the role of high-technology in each; global    Chinese arms dealers and copyright pirates; thousands of    Japanese spies needed to combat "Asian" threats.    These scares might well be orchestrated in support of    Clipper 3 -- to the mutual benefit of international     governments and commerce as stated by the IWGCP report.    The Clipper 3 report, as John Gilmore and others have    noted, aims at an international clampdown on non-GAKed    crypto. For this to work, all the major crypto players must    agree to act at the same time so that no one gets an    advantage by offering non-GAKed products.    But is it not probable that there will be a holdout    nation(s), like the Swiss in war and bank secrecy, to offer    crypto that is non-GAKed? Or will a holdout be starved?    Or is it more likely that the genuine alternative to    multilateral governmental regulation is going to be small-    scale, non-corporate, private parties, insusceptible to    large-sacle governmental-market coercion, willing to offer    risky, covert services, perhaps as lucrative as prohibited    armaments?    In such a case, for example, would not a highly skilled    cryptographer, let us call her Mathilda Blaze, be able to    sell covert crypto (on the side, encrypted transactions,    anonymity assured) for far greater reward than a not-very-    secure pittance and pension at a downsizing ATT, or NSA, or    Russia, China, Israel, France, UK, NL, JP ... ?    To be sure, if we knew what they knew, we would understand    why the House has just increased the intelligence budget to    $30bn, $2bn more than 1996 (WaPo 5-23-96).    Maybe all the major crypto nations (gov-and-com), are    minting E-money to pay their best techies to protect their    secrets. If so, may the best algorithmist take 'em all to    the cleaners -- just remember to share with the hackers    spooking the spooks-and-crooks of gov-com intel-insec,    and causing "Yo, man's" of recognition and admiration of     those peering for pennies at ELINT and NetSec screens.

Follow-up to Peter Wayner's post yesterday:    The New York Times, May 24, 1996, p. D8.    American Banknote Gets Into Pachinko    The American Banknote Corporation said yesterday that it    was developing optical-reading technology for a group of    Japanese companies to help prevent counterfeit prepaid    cards in the pachinko business.    Pachinko, which is similar to pinball, is played in some    18,000 parlors in Japan and has grown in popularity in the    last few years.    Morris Weissman, American Banknote's chairman, said    American Banknote's holographics unit was making cash-value    cards and machines to read them. The cards and machines    will be tested in Japan in July, and "if certain criteria    are met," more will be installed in August, he said.    He said cards would authorize a person to play a game of    pachinko and win money. The cards, he said had "specific    algorithms and codes we believe are almost impossible to    duplicate."    -----

Yet the DERA forensic laboratory that carries       out tests in many high-profile terrorist cases       frequently finds more than this on its floor.

New Sci 25 May 1996:    "Panning for data gold."       Nowadays nearly every organization from supermarkets to       the police can boast a vast mine of electronic data.       Separating the gold from the dross is the real       challenge. A growing band of computer scientists say       they can dig out nuggets of 24-carat knowledge from huge       mountains of database dross. They call themselves "data       miners", and they are wielding some pretty impressive       tools -- information theory, laws of probability,        neural networks, tree induction, genetic algoritms,        disjunctive normal form logic.       But the impact of their efforts is anything but esoteric.       By identifying potential new customers -- or ways of       hanging on to existing ones -- this information is worth       millions in extra revenue. And this is just the start,       according to Usama Fayyad of Microsoft Research and       co-editor of a new book on data mining.    MIN_ers

21+C, Scanning the Future (UK), February, 1996:    "Dataveillance."    A global trend is emerging toward citizen surveillance.    While authorities speak of the need for data regulation and    people become digital shadows, watchdogs are doing some    monitoring of their won. With interviews of Phil Agre,    Roger Clarke and Simon Davies on invasive and privacy    technology.       These technologies face an uphill public relations       battle. Digital cash has already been widely accused of       providing money launderers, drug barons and other       criminals with the perfect means of continuing their       activities. It's the same argument that was used in the       Clipper Chip debate, in which the US government proposed       a central encryption software, and it will no doubt be       directed towards pseudonymous techniques as they emerge.       Simon Davies is familiar with this type of argument. He       says there has been a change of political winds in       recent years. Where once privacy was used to protect       individual freedoms it is now officially deemed by       governments and corporations to be an aid to criminals       and a barrier to administrative efficiency. "In a       generation, we now have privacy as almost like an       ancient forgotten wisdom," he says. Then he adds: "The       point that needs to be made very clear is that       technology has been misused. It always did have the       capacity, the capability to be a friend to people.       Instead, it has become a potential tool of enslavement.       And it has rendered society vulnerable on a scale that       has never been seen before. It is technologists and       politicians and financiers who have misused the       technology and should be brought to account for it."    UNV_eil

October 29, 1996
A Primer On The Proposed WIPO Treaty On Database Extraction Rights That Will Be Considered In December 1996*
James Love, Consumer Project on Technology
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) will
consider in December 1996 a new treaty that would require most
countries (including the United States) to severely curtail the
public's rights to use pubic domain materials stored in "databases."
Some experts say it is the "least balanced and most potentially anti-
competitive intellectual property rights ever created."  The U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is accepting public comments on
this treaty, and a digital copyright treaty that is also troubling.
Comments are due by November 22, 1996, and can be submitted by
electronic mail to: diploconf at uspto.gov.  Copies of the treaty,
commentary, and the PTO federal register notice is available from
  This memorandum provides background
information on the treaty and the problems it presents.

October 25 Science reports on the latest teleportation research
in "To Send Data, Physicists Resort to Quantum Voodoo."
It describes a laser-driven apparatus for transmitting highly
secure encoded (but not encrypted) messages via entangled
photon states.
IBM's Charles Bennett says, "as other researchers work to
harness quantum mechanics for computation and
cryptography, teleportation could become the equivalent
of a quantum mail service."

 "Transaction Records Urged for Smart Cards"
    Electronic money systems must generate transaction records     to help law enforcement agencies track money launderers, a     senior Justice Department official said last week. "In a     paper environment ... we can get bank records, we can get
    credit card records. Our goal is only to preserve this ability."
 "Internet insecurity "
    Jeff Schiller: The Web has a lot of potential vulnerabilities.
    There's plenty I know about that I don't want to talk about.     People who know about the vulnerabilities are reluctant to talk     about them because if we disclose what we know to the public,     the bad guys will take advantage. And if we address them with     the vendor community, they don't do anything about them.     There's a lot of hooey out there. Never trust the advice of     someone selling you a product, especially if the sales pitch     is, "My product makes your problem go away."
 "RSA offers kit for secure credit-card transactions"
    RSA Data Security, Inc. will announce today a tool kit for     developing secure applications that support credit-card     transactions on the Internet called S/Pay in support of
    SET.
 "Medcom introduces a "Super Cafe" data encryption product"
    Medcom's latest data encryption product, the Secure Socket     Relay (SSR), features strong encryption with full key length     (56-bits DES). A demo version can be downloaded at
     "On Technology's Security White Paper"     "Taking The Threat Out Of Network Security," will stimulate     the industry into discussing some of the issues of security     that face the Internet industry and its users.

In another story on gov-spooked insecurity:
 NEC announced that it successfully demonstrated country-to-
 country virtual private networking (VPN). During the tests,  privacy and security was maintained between the two sites by  deploying DES and triple-DES encryption. Since DES  encryption technology cannot be exported from the United  States, a Japanese version of DES, developed outside the  U.S., was used.

Return-Path: lzkoch at mcs.net

John Young:
This is an identical letter to a limited number of contributors to
Cypherpunks regarding an article I will be writing for Upside Magazine about
the Cypherpunks List -- its history and the current controversies it now
seems to be facing.
(I'm the person who uncovered the Gorelick/"Manhattan project" story. A more
recent "Cybersense" column dealt with Chicago Police Superintendent Matt
Rodriguez wanting to escape from a 1974 Federal Court injunction against
police department spying on "radicals" so that he could now join in on
investigating Cyberterrorists. See  )  I will  be
writing a number of articles for the magazine itself.  I have been "lurking"
on Cypherpunks for about nine months with only one communications to the
list regarding a request for leads on "Snake Oil" stories.)
I would like to better understand and be able to explain to Upside readers
why several members have chose to "leave" the List.
Perry Metzger and others have argued that flaming and extraneous personal
attacks have negatively impacted serious discussions of encryption, hacking
and public policy and thus they have chosen to end their relationship and
their writings on Cypherpunks, with Metzger forming his own, moderated list.
Others contributors to Cypherpunks have argued that there have been
"distractions" rants about religion, assassination politics, and language
which are inappropriate for the List membership.
Late last week John Gilmore wrote and said he had taken steps to remove Dr.
Vulis from the list which has prompted differing responses.  Some have
responded positively to Gilmore's actions while others have said that it was
an affront to freedom of speech and individual decision-making.
(I have very deliberately chosen _not_ to make this an open letter to the
list, nor will I engage in any open List-dialogue about the people I am
interviewing or what I expect to write.  Naturally I will respond to
individuals once the article is published.)  I do not expect to be able to publish your responses in their entirety.
They will be edited with honesty and clarity.   I have no agenda here.
I will consider all your written and/or phone communications to be "on the
record" unless you specifically wish prior selected and/or identified parts
of your communications to be "off the record" or "for background purposes
only."  I will _not_ publicly announce a full list of those I have
contacted.  While you are of course free to share this letter with others, I
have already made fairly firm decisions as to who I will contact.  I would
ask that your circulation be highly limited, if circulate you must.  On the
other hand, I will seriously consider suggestions you might offer me
regarding other people who you believe I should contacted regarding this
article. The article will be lengthy but I do not entertain the idea -- at
this point -- about expanding the article into a book length manuscript.
That doesn't mean that if thousands upon thousands gather outside by home
demanding more information, that sometime in the future...
I would prefer to communicate in the open, mainly because I am just now
somewhat tenuously managing PGP through Private Idaho. Those of you who
insist your communications be encrypted, well, it's probably good for my
soul that I honor your request.
Here are the questions I would like you to consider.  Please do not consider
them "definitive" or limiting.  If you believe I have missed out on pursing
certain avenues of thought and argument, please do not hesitate to point
them out to me.  I will note that I will be looking at the history of the
list and I have noted the letter from Hal Finney regarding
I do not expect to write a general follow-up question to this entire list
but I may wish to seek further clarification from individuals from their
answers to this letter.
Thank you, in advance, for what I know will be thoughtful and considered
1.  What was the original purpose of the Cypherpunks list and has it
changed?  For the better?  Worse?
2.  Does the apparent breakup reveal anything in general about unregulated,
unmoderated lists?  Can one make a link to the breakup to an inherent
failure in the concept of anarchism? Can one make a link from this breakup
to any insight in the nature of the Net itself -- both now and in the
future.     3.  What do you think led to the  growing number of highly personal, highly
inflammatory attacks made on various contributors to the list -- Tim May
most especially. 4.  Do you consider discussions about religion, assassination politics, and
other non- cryptographic/encryption subjects to be "distractions" or
substantive additions to intellectual inquiry?  Are some threads more
valuable than others?
5.  Has the list imploded or veered off in a new, positive direction?  I would ask that you use the header "Cypherstory" in your response and
Cypherstory 1, 2 etc. for further communications, additions, changes.
Thank you

 "Web security threat grows"
 With a variety of new technologies like stronger encryption,
 smart cards and digital signatures and envelopes emerging to
 tighten Web security, experts working on various aspects of the
 problem agree the goal of end-to-end security on the Web will
 remain elusive as long as insecure operating systems dominate
 the commercial market. "You can't build security on top of
 insecurity," said Netscape's Jim Roskind, who spent much of a
 session on Webware fending off criticism of Java security flaws.
 "We have to assume that the [security] problems will be  pervasive forever," warned Peter Neumann. "This is a holistic  problem, and we have to deal with it in a global way."
 "Protection sought for U.S. systems"
 The initiative will be led by the Pentagon's Computer Emergency
 Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University and the Energy
 Department's Computer Incident Advisory Capability.
 "Motorola unveils chip for contactless smart card"
 One chip designing a contactless card that meets all
 frequencies of a proposed standard while the other adds
 cryptography to a single-chip solution.
 The other card incorporates a 1,024-bit modular encryption
 processor that is reportedly one of the fastest in the industry.
 "U.S.Joint Venture to Market Acoustic Smart Card Technology"
 NeTegrity also announced it has invested $1 million in Encotone,
 Ltd., for a 10% equity interest in the Israeli company. Other
 Encotone, Ltd. investors include ECI Telecom, a $500 million
 Israeli telecommunications firm, and Professor Michal Ben Or,
 Head of the Department of Computer Science at Hebrew
 University of Jerusalem and a worldwide authority on cryptology.
 "Microchip Technology launches highly secure smart card family  with KEELOQ code hopping technology"
 The SCS152 provides a programmable 64-bit cryptographic key
 used to create a digital signature unique to each card, which
 reduces the possibility of unwanted access to card information
 and the "cloning" of these cards for unauthorized payments.
 Other features include programmable user memory and
 "anti-tearing," which prevents the information in the card from
 being corrupted if the supply voltage is interrupted.
 "EEMA Lobbies Over Limiting US Encryption Controls"
 EEMA recognizes that the principal reasons for this is the
 disparate European legislation that surrounds the use of
 encryption, and the fact that inter-working with dominant
 US-based computer software -- operating system and application
 software -- is subject to US legislation and restrictions.
 "Putting EDI to the test"
 Security continues to be the main sticking point for using the Net
 as a vehicle for EDI. Vendors that will demonstrate secure  E-mail messages transporting EDI documents over the Web.
 The technology used is S/MIME, an encrypted version of the
 popular MIME protocol.
 "V-One Secures New Clients"
 NSA runs the nation's code-breaking operations, and DISA is
 supposed to keep the nation's networks secure, so there is not
 much chance of finding out what they do with the software they
 have bought from V-One.

Vigorous Cypherpunk debate on its purpose and future may be
   a harbinger of global conflict. A book review today on
   global conflict and six related essays in November
   Foreign Affairs may provide illumination -- both for
   Cypherpunk's crypto-mission and for its intramural clashes.

   "A Scholar's Prophecy: Global Cultural Conflict." Book
   review.
      With the end of the cold war, the division of the world
      into ideological camps and political networks has
      yielded to the basic human propensity to find meaning
      and identity in cultural commonality -- in blood,
      religion, heritage and birthright. After four centuries
      of Western domination, global politics will now become
      a complicated and deadly earnest contest among the
      world's major civilizations, mainly the Western one, the
      Islamic one, and the Sinic one deriving from China.
      Unless the West recognizes the power of cultural
      conflict, it could perish from ignorance, overconfidence
      and complacency.

      belief is arrogant, false, and dangerous. The spread of
      Western consumer goods is not the spread of Western
      culture. Drinking CocaCola makes a Russian no more
      Western than eating sushi makes an American Japanese.
      The essence of the West is the Magna Carta, not the
      Magna Mac. As countries modernize, they may westernize
      in superficial ways, but not in the most important
      measures of culture language, religion, values. In fact,
      as countries modernize they seek refuge from the modern
      world in their traditional, parochial cultures and
      religions. Around the globe, education and democracy are
      leading to "indigenization." And as the power of the
      West ebbs, "the rest" will become more and more
      assertive. For the West to survive as a vibrant and
      powerful civilization, it must abandon the pretense of
      universality and close ranks. Its future depends on its
      unity. The peoples of the West must hang together, or
      they will hang separately.
   Democracy and the National Interest, Strobe Talbott
      Democracy makes good neighbors, and in an increasingly
      interconnected world the United States has both the
      means and the motive to promote the democratic process
      abroad. On the home front, Americans crave a foreign
      policy grounded, like their nation, in idealpolitik as
      well as realpolitik. The administration has made support
      of nascent democracies a priority of its diplomacy from
      Latin America to East Asia, and the returns from South
      Africa, Haiti, Russia, even Bosnia seem positive. But
      democratization is a long, hard journey in which
      elections are only the first step. The United States
      should encourage new democratic governments through
      their most fragile phase.
   Defense in an Age of Hope, William J. Perry
      Twice before, America had the opportunity to make the
      prevention of conflict its first line of defense. It
      must not lose this moment after the Cold War to foment
      a revolution in security strategy. Preventing
      proliferation is key, and U.S. programs help turn Soviet
      missile sites into sunflower fields. The American armed
      services the world's most emulated, show other
      militaries how to function in a civil society and
      conduct exchanges that head off misunderstandings. In
      Europe, George Marshall's fondest hopes are being
      realized through the Partnership for Peace which
      reverberates well beyond the security realm. Meanwhile,
      the United States leverages forces for maximum
      deterrence and invests in smart technology. But its best
      investment is in openness and trust, the essential tools
      of the art of peace.
   Germany's New Right, Jacob Heilbrunn
      Not skinheads in jackboots but journalists, novelists,
      professors, and young businessmen constitute the German
      new right. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, they have
      sought the "normalization" of German history, a revival
      of nationalism, and recognition that Germany is the most
      powerful country in Europe. When confronted with the
      Nazi past, they talk about Stalin's crimes and complain
      of an oppressive "political correctness." Violence
      against immigrants is answered with complaints of
      attacks against Germans. Though not a political
      movement, the new right is extending the boundaries of
      the politically acceptable.
   Banning Ballistic Missiles, Alton Frye
      Heady years for arms control make a superpower
      complacent. The structure of restraint accepted by
      Washington and Moscow could crack; meanwhile,
      proliferation continues apace and nuclear materials
      trickle onto the world market. The Clinton team has
      followed through on the work of past negotiators, but it
      is high time for a third START. The United States should
      propose the dramatic steps of placing nuclear warheads
      in "strategic escrow" and banning ballistic missiles.
      Advanced monitoring and inspection technologies make the
      plan practicable, and there will be security payoffs for
      all.
   Is the World Ready for Free Trade?, Charles R. Carlisle
      Though a leap to global free trade is a nice idea, the
      political support is just not there. Nor is any such
      earthshaking step necessary. The World Trade
      Organization has an extensive built-in agenda that
      should not be derailed. Fears of regionalism are greatly
      exaggerated, since regional trade has not increased much
      since the early 1970S and current plans for free trade
      in the Americas and the Pacific are unlikely to succeed.
      Few countries share the free-trade faith of the United
      States and Great Britain, and even in those places,
      economic anxiety threatens to push trade in the other
      direction.

Breaking Into Electronic Commerce [Excerpts]
By Larry Lange
Internet commerce is a riddle wrapped in an enigma. At once the
biggest opportunity the computer and communications industries face in
the latter half of the 1990s, it also represents their biggest risk. ...
The L0pht is about what you'd expect in the way of headquarters for a
motley group of twentysomething computer hackers with Internet
names like Deth Vegtable, Brian Oblivion and Mudge. ...
Mudge and his ilk of brilliant break-in artists believe they play an important role as the underground angels of Internet commerce, minding the gates to the new digital marketplace. ...
Eric Hughes agrees. As a co-founder of Cypherpunks, Hughes is part of a virtual band of code crackers spun out of the Advanced Computer Lab at the University of California at Berkeley, connected by a regular listserv-group e-mail that reports as many as 60 security breeches daily. The group's raison d'etre, says Hughes, is "evaluating security in the interest of the user.'' His frank appraisal of the state of the art in electronic-commerce products is a tonic for the hyperbole of the public-relations machine.
"I disagree with the characterization that electronic-security tools are in a high state of excellence,'' Hughes says. "In fact, I consider the state-of-shelf quite poor and not economical to deploy. Until platform security is drastically improved, these kinds of problems correctly lead to some queasiness over the widespread use of PCs to keep secrets.'' Like it or not, the Web denizens like Hughes and Mudge hold the key to the future of electronic commerce on the Internet, and everyone in the industry knows it. ...
Not all Internet companies are courting the cyber Robin Hoods, however. "We're trying to prove that cryptography is powerful and can make viable, attractive and commercial propositions, while at the same time protecting people's privacy,'' says David Chaum,
"The Cypherpunk approach is the opposite. It's 'We're gonna make and break systems and we're gonna debunk things by finding weakness in systems.''' [Snip balance of longish feature article]

And recaps the ancient struggle between "public-governmental" in the "public interest" and "private-anti-governmental" in the "private interest."
Those who argue that the public needs protection from internal and

has a long heritage as a big-time, self-interested business, or racketeer

Cypherpunks does not seem to me to be anything like the well-
regulated lists you ascribe to Prof Volokh.
Could you, with Professor Volokh, expand on the application of "editorial control" on "unmoderated" lists? (See Netly below)
As well as amplify "the power to kick folks off a list ... if conversation veers too far from the list's charter." (See your quote below) Isn't this power the black heart of free speech racketeering? And what makes the glands of secret authoritarians thrill with benevolent suppression of assent on behalf of the disorderly, fuzzy-minded citizenry?
Media moguls and list runners share commonalities, to be sure,
but I wonder if it's not cruel to compare John Gilmore to Professsor
Volokh, and both to, say, Rupert Murdoch.

Eugene Volokh, a law professor at UCLA, runs a number of mailing
lists and has kicked people off to maintain better editorial control.
Volokh says that the most valuable publications are those that
exercise the highest degree of editorial control.
[Your post of 11-13]
In my experience, and I've talked about this at some length with Prof. Volokh who runs a number of lists himself, the best and most valuable
discussion lists are those that are unmoderated but have a list owner who
has the power to kick folks off a list and can try to steer the direction
of a conversation if it veers too far from the list's charter.

Not to diminish the validity of Tim's alarm, is there not reason to
anticipate that
these tokens will be crackable. And thus continue the race between crypto enforcers and crackers?
In addition to the recent successes against smart cards, there seems to be trouble with the government's program for widespread use of Fortezza cards, according to complaints of various military and civilian sites. The Fortezza
site at ljl.com seems to have been set up so that open, easily accessible
information could be gotten by the harried military users (see, for example,
the list of Fortezza complaints at  ).
Moreover, there is surely to be continued competition among the players
who are trying to increase their market share -- both government and
commercial, both domestic and international. Will they not continue to attack each other's crypto products? And will not each nation's government
continue to subsidize their favored producers in international economic and
military contentions?
The point is made on cypherpunks that the odds are increasingly on the crackers even if there are periodic gains by behind-the-scenes plots among
the enforcers and there temporary allies (as Tim notes, these are often short-
term romances). And that hardware systems are the most vulnerable due to their illusory physical security -- the fatal conceit that brawn can beat brains in crypto, as it claims it used to do in iron- and fire-power (that was
before iron became subservient to code).

October 1996
Since the end of 1995 the central banks of the Group of Ten (G-10) countries have been studying the development of electronic money and the various policy issues which it raises. Much of this work has been carried out by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) or by monetary policy experts from G-10 central banks. Electronic money was discussed by BIS member central banks at meetings in Basle in July and September 1996. In August, the BIS published a report on the Security of Electronic Money prepared by the CPSS and the Group of Computer Experts.
This report provides a definition of electronic money and a description of its key features. It discusses the factors influencing the development of e-money products. Finally, it reviews the policy issues raised by e-money developments, as seen from a central bank perspective, and discusses the possible policy responses.

The New York Times, October 1, 1996, pp. D1, D2.    Accord Near On Computer Security Codes       'Key' System Required For Law Enforcement    By David E. Sanger    Washington, Sept. 30 -- After several years of debate    between the computer industry and American intelligence    agencies, President Clinton has decided to permit American    computer companies to export more powerful data-scrambling    software but only if they establish a system that will    enable keys to the code to be obtained by law enforcement    officials with a court warrant.    Administration officials, speaking on the condition of    anonymity, said Mr. Clinton reached his decision late last    week and that Vice President Al Gore would announce it on    Wednesday or Thursday.    Several big computer companies, led by the I.B.M., have    agreed to the new system, but many others, which have    opposed past proposals by the Administration for data-    scrambling policies, are likely to object.    Many American computer and software executives have long    argued that United States export controls on the most    sophisticated data-privacy technology put American industry    at a disadvantage versus products sold by their foreign    competitors.    But the Clinton White House, like previous Administrations,    citing national security issues and fears of foreign    terrorists or criminals, is loath to permit the export of    some of the most powerful data-scrambling software. The    reason has chiefly been that intelligence agencies feared    such equipment would be used by foreign terrorists, drug    cartels and other criminals to hide transactions and    communications.    Now, in a compromise, according to two senior officials in    the Administration who have been deeply involved in the new    policy, American companies will be permitted on Jan. 1 to    export software that encrypts, or scrambles, data using    "keys" -- lengthy numeric codes -- that are up to 56 bits    long. Until now, companies have been prohibited from    selling products abroad that have keys longer than 40 bits.    Mr. Clinton has also decided to move the authority for    exporting the encryption software from the State    Department, which has had export-licensing authority    because the technology has been classified as munitions, to    the Commerce Department, which controls the export of    products that have both commercial and military use.    Industry officials have long urged that change, betting the    Commerce Department would be more inclined to give a higher    priority to American competitive interests.    But starting in two years, American companies choosing to    export the more sophisticated software would have to set up    what the industry is calling a "key recovery" system. That    system would enable intelligence officials and law    enforcement agents, armed with court warrants, to go    through a lengthy multi-step process that would give them    the mathematical key to decoding scrambled communications.    The approach replaces the Administration's earlier proposed    "key escrow" system in which the Government would have been    the repository of the numeric keys -- leading to fears of    potential Government abuse, or a reluctance by legitimate    foreign users to buy the software.    Under the new plan, the keys may be held by third-party    companies. And large institutions, like banks may be    allowed to hold their keys in escrow -- assuming they pass    some kind of Government certification.    Still, the success of the system will depend on large part    on the Administration's efforts to persuade other countries    to adopt the same "key recovery" system, allowing their    intelligence agencies and justice systems to cooperate in    trailing criminals across national borders. But Mr.    Clinton's aides acknowledged today that this process has    just begun, and so far only England and France have    expressed much enthusiasm.    "It is going to take a while to persuade people that their    data is safe under this system, that it protects privacy,    and yet that we can use the system to trace terrorists or    drug dealers," one senior Administration official said.    Officials at I.B.M., which is expected to announce on    Wednesday the creation of an industry consortium to aid in    establishing the "key recovery" system, said today that no    single entity would hold the entire key.    Instead, it will be divided up across several companies    that would handle any given message, much the way the    launching officials in nuclear missile silos each had only    part of the key instructions needed to begin a nuclear    attack.    If the C.I.A., for example, obtained a court order to    decode a message, it would have to go to several groups    with its warrant to piece together the key.    "We believe that this solves the, biggest weak point in the    previous plans, where one entity held the key," said an    I.B.M. official familiar with the company's announcement.    But these steps are not likely to silence all the critics.    "There is still a perception that the U.S. is trying to    extend its intelligence capability by setting standards    around the world," said Marc Rotenberg, director of the    Electronic Privacy Information Center.    There are other potential holes in the system. Customers in    the United States will be free to buy encryption software    of any complexity -- as they can today -- with keys that    are much longer than 56 bits and are nearly impossible to    break. That means terrorist groups or drug dealers could    still buy such software and sneak it out of the country, or    even transmit it over computer networks.    "There is nothing we can do about bright students or Joe    Terrorist who use sophisticated encryption systems to    communicate with each other," one senior administration    official said. "But when they brush up against legitimate    groups, especially banks," the official said, "then they    are more likely to be dealing with a system" where law    enforcement could use the key recovery system to decode the    communications.    On Capitol Hill, several bills had been pending that would    lift all export controls on encryption software, but the    legislation did not move as the current session of Congress    wound down. In Congressional testimony last week, Jamie S.    Gorelick, Deputy Attorney General, said lifting all export    controls would "undermine our leadership role in fighting    international crime and damage our own national security    interests."

The New York Times, October 2, 1996, pp. D1, D8.    Compromise Is Offered on Computer Security Codes    By John Markoff    The Clinton Administration offered a compromise to the    computer industry yesterday by holding out the possibility    of removing all export restrictions on data-scrambling    technology for companies that accept a new approach to    allow law enforcement officials to unscramble coded    messages. The new system is being recommended by an    alliance led by I.B.M..    The approach is to be announced today and has passed muster    with the Central Intelligence Agency. It would enable law    enforcement officials to unscramble computer communications    -- provided they have a warrant -- without having to obtain    a mathematical key to the code.    Instead, the agents could use the warrant to obtain the    cooperation of outside parties to help unscramble portions    of code accompanying a message. This information would then    allow law enforcement officials to draw mathematical    inferences enabling them to decipher the scrambled    messages.    By making it at least a two-step process to decipher a    scrambled, or encrypted, message, and by requiring the    cooperation of at least two outside parties designated by    the code users themselves, the approach is supposed to    address the main criticisms against data-scrambling systems    previously endorsed by the Government.    But some industry executives and privacy-rights advocates    said yesterday that the new approach would not satisfy    their objections to a Government-backed eavesdropping    system. Critics contend that any such system could    compromise the privacy of United States citizens and hinder    the ability of American high-technology companies to sell    their most sophisticated data-security products overseas.    Executives of the International Business Machines    Corporation said late yesterday that they were still lining    up the final list of companies in the alliance. Those    involved will include Digital Equipment and smaller    data-security companies including RSA Data Security, Cylink    and Trusted Information Systems.    The computer industry and the Clinton Administration, as    well as factions within the Administration, have been at an    impasse for years over export policy for data-scrambling    technology. Intelligence and law enforcement agencies,    fearing that such technology can be used by terrorists and    criminals to conspire with impunity, have insisted on a    system for cracking the coded messages under certain    circumstances.    Seeking to end the deadlock, I.B.M. set in motion the new    compromise earlier this year when it demonstrated its    experimental approach to the C.I.A. Director, John Deutsch.    Mr. Deutsch then took an active role in the internal    Administration debate, in which Justice Department and    F.B.I. officials had previously taken a hard line against    loosening export controls, according to several people    familiar with the talks.    In a public statement issued yesterday Vice President Al    Gore said that if the I.B.M. data-deciphering technology    proved workable, there would no longer be export    restrictions on the strength of the data-scrambling    technology or on the type of software algorithms -- or    mathematical formulas -- employed.    The Administration is calling the I.B.M. approach a "key    recovery" system. The designation is meant to distinguish    it from previously proposed "key escrow" systems, like one    called Clipper that the Government put forth a few years    ago.    In an escrow system, one or more Government or    private-industry escrow agents would hold keys for    unlocking coded messages, which could be used by    law-enforcement agents with a warrant. The drawbacks,    according to I.B.M., are that the storage of the keys can    become a record-keeping nightmare and can also make the    system vulnerable to unauthorized use of the keys.    The I.B.M. approach is intended to eliminate this    vulnerability by giving no third party an actual key to the    code. Instead, at least two "trusted agents" would be    required to help unscramble encrypted information in the    header of each message. Only after this portion of the    message is deciphered, I.B.M. said, would law-enforcement    agents be able to unscramble the contents of the message    itself by recreating the original key to the code.    "Our theory is this should work the same way as your filing    cabinet," said Kathy Kincaid, an I.B.M. computer security    executive. "You wouldn't give law enforcement the keys to    your filing cabinet unless they had a search warrant."    And yet, even one of the companies that I.B.M. is counting    on as an alliance member said yesterday that new approach    did not go far enough beyond the old Clipper plan, in terms    of privacy protection.    "The Government announcement is disastrous," said Jim    Bidzos, chief executive of RSA Data Security, one of the    country's leading developers of data-scrambling software.    "We warned I.B.M. that the National Security Agency would    try to twist their technology."    The Clinton Administration also angered executives at the    software company Netscape Communications, who warned that    even the new Government plan would continue to hinder the    American industry's ability to compete internationally.    Peter Harter, Netscape's public-policy lawyer, contended    that the Administration was playing favorites among    computer companies, rewarding those willing to go along    with its approach by removing export restrictions that    might be retained for companies not willing to incorporate    the "key recovery" system in their products.    "This is tantamount to making public policy by extorting    high-tech companies," Mr. Harter said.    But some computer hardware makers were more conciliatory.    "From my perspective the process has been much better this    time," said Eric Schmitt, Sun Microsystem's chief    technology officer. "The question is still, 'How will    industry implement key recovery?' It's still too early to    say."    [End]

C|NET, October 2, 1996, 1:45 p.m. PT    Computer alliance supports encryption policy     By Alex Lash    An alliance of 11 software and hardware companies has    just announced its formation to develop key-recovery    solutions for electronic encryption, a crucial component    of the Clinton administration's latest plan to loosen the    export of encryption technology.    Announced yesterday, the administration's plan gives    exporters of encryption or encrypted software a two-year    window starting January 1, 1997, to build what the    administration calls "key recovery" into their products.    IBM, Apple Computer, Atalla, Digital Equipment, Groupe    Bull, Hewlett-Packard, NCR, RSA Data Security, Sun    Microsystems, Trusted Information Systems, and United    Parcel Service have banded together to develop systems    that will give the government what it wants, which is    access to suspicious encrypted messages, so that    compliant software companies will be able to get export    licenses for hard-to-crack encryption codes.     "Export controls are a fact of life," RSA President Jim    Bidzos said today. "In an imperfect world this technique    will at least allow you to take advantage of what    governments around the world will allow."     RSA's presence in the alliance is not only a coup for the    government but a big surprise, as Bidzos has been one of    the most vocal opponents of the Clinton administration's    key escrow efforts. He has even accused the government of    offering software companies special "sweetheart" deals to    gain support for its encryption regulation plans.    A key-recovery plan not only satisfies the government's    desire for court-ordered access to encrypted messages,    but also sets off alarm bells for privacy advocates and    civil libertarians. Some within the U.S. software    industry also claim they won't be able to sell encrypted    products overseas if customers know the U.S. government    has access to a skeleton key.     "While some companies might choose to cast their lot with    the government's key-escrow policy, the marketplace is    likely to reject the approved products," said David    Sobel, legal counsel for the Electronic Privacy    Information Center. "Users want strong security, not    guaranteed government access to their communications."    However, the concept of key recovery is not anathema to    companies that acknowledge that firms and folks using    encryption to secure electronic transactions and    communications will need backup copies of their keys,    just as homeowners keep an extra house key under a flower    pot.    Under the new government plan, a company that promises to    participate in key recovery will receive a six-month    license to export up to 56-bit DES encryption. When the    promise is fulfilled and the government can get access to    the decryption keys, the 56-bit limit is lifted. If by    the end of the two-year grace period the company has not    fulfilled its promise to implement a key-recovery scheme,    the 56-bit limit is dropped back down to the current    40-bit limit.    "The fact that 56-bit DES [a type of encryption] will be    available from significant sources is going to jump-start    electronic commerce," said Ken Kay, executive director of    the Computer Systems Policy Project, a public policy    group comprised of 12 computer industry CEOs.     Now that the details are out and endorsements are coming    in, executive action is expected in the next two to three    weeks, according to one senior administration official.    President Clinton will soon sign an executive order that    transfers jurisdiction over encryption export licenses    from the State Department to the Commerce Department, a    move that the computer industry has asked for in the past    because they see Commerce as a more sympathetic agency.    At the same time, Commerce will announce a new set of    streamlined rules to grant companies a "fast track" to an    export license if they comply with key recovery, the    official said.    Commerce plans to begin licensing on January 1.    But the new plan will also give the Justice Department a    voice in the licensing process, a detail that angers    privacy advocates and software companies alike.     "The transfer from State to Commerce has been called for    for a long time, but a small tweak is that the FBI now    has veto power," said Peter Harter, legal counsel to    Netscape Communications. "Domestic law enforcement    shouldn't have a seat at the table."     Harter acknowledged that Netscape has not ruled out key    recovery but said that the market must show demand for    it. The administration has said it hopes to introduce a    bill next spring that would encourage the build-up of key    recovery by establishing laws on the conduct of    third-party key holders. But it will not try to mandate    key recovery through legislation.     "I think we have a critical mass of companies willing to    work with us," said Heidi Kukis, spokesperson for the    Vice President's office. "That would make legislation to    mandate key recovery very unlikely."     Another fear is that the administration is using export    limits to control domestic use of encryption. While Gore    directly stated yesterday that domestic use of encryption    will remain unregulated, the double standard for domestic    and international products might discourage U.S.    companies from developing two different versions, leaving    U.S. and Canadian customers with the same products that    the federal government has deemed safe to ship overseas.     "We obtained and intend to hold the administration to its    assurances that export controls would not be used to    control domestic use," said Kay of the CSPP. "The CEOs    have told the administration that if they want to do    domestic controls, they should do it frontally through    the democratic process and introduce legislation."     [End]

The New York Times, October 4, 1996, p. A32.    A Flawed Encryption Policy [Editorial]    The new White House proposal to keep high-powered    encryption software out of the hands of foreign terrorists    and criminals is needlessly restrictive and probably    unworkable. Though the new plan is better than previous    Administration proposals, it risks doing more harm than    good.    The Administration is rightly worried that foreign    terrorists or criminals will get hold of encryption    software that will make it impossible for the Government to    eavesdrop on their telephone and computer messages. The    technology is legal in this country, but the Administration    wants to keep the powerful new software out of foreign    hands.    However, the Administration downplays the fact that    encryption is also a good way for honest citizens to    prevent crime. At a time when banks and other private    companies send vast amounts of confidential information    over the electronic highway, it would seem sensible to make    high-quality encryption widely available so that the    private sector can protect itself from criminal or    malicious eavesdropping. For that reason, the Government    ought to promote wide-scale dissemination of encryption,    both here and abroad.    Trying to block dissemination is probably useless and    almost certainly harmful to American exports. Powerful    encryption systems made by foreign companies are already    available in Europe and Asia, and American exporters will    need to sell state-of-the-art software to keep competitive.    The Clinton Administration previously proposed that the    computer industry adopt a single type of encryption, known    as key-escrow, which would scramble messages with    mathematical passwords. Under the plan, private companies    and individuals would turn over these passwords to the    Government, which, with court authorization, could use them    to unscramble the phone and computer traffic. The purpose    of key-escrow, then, would be to preserve the Government's    existing ability to tap phone calls.    But that Clinton plan was firmly rejected by industry and    privacy-rights advocates who feared that a government that    held passwords would abuse First Amendment prohibitions    against listening in on private communications. The latest    White House plan addresses many of these concerns. It would    impose restrictions only on the software that exporters    sell abroad. Privacy advocates have less to fear from the    latest plan because it would allow individuals to deposit    their passwords with private organizations, rather than the    Government.    Yet the Administration has not explained why foreigners    would buy American software that would allow the F.B.I. to    eavesdrop when they could buy equally powerful software    from non-American manufacturers that omits any such trap    door. Critics assume that foreign governments -- few of    which pay attention to American constitutional protections    against invasion of privacy -- would demand access to    passwords, making such software unattractive for anyone to    use.    There is room to improve the plan. A panel of the National    Research Council recently concluded that there is no good    reason to restrict exports of currently available    encryption because foreigners already have access to    equally powerful software. There is time to work out    restrictions, in cooperation with the industry and privacy    advocates, for the next generation of encryption software.    In the meantime the Administration might push forward on    the panel's other sensible recommendations -- such as    developing better encryption expertise within the F.B.I.    and helping the private sector develop the encryption    software it needs to stop illegal eavesdropping.

The Washington Post, October 4, 1996, p. A22.    Crypto Politics [Editorial]    The Clinton administration once had a coherent, if    unpopular, position on encryption software, the stuff that    allows you to encode your email messages or other data so    that no one can read it en route without a key. Now, in the    wake of word that the president will sign an executive    order, the position is no longer coherent, nor discernibly    more popular with the high-tech audience it attempts to    mollify.    People and companies doing international financial business    are highly interested in this kind of software, the more    powerfully "uncrackable" the better. The U.S. software    industry thinks there's a lot of money in it, especially if    encryption becomes routine.    The administration position till recently was that, much as    U.S. software companies might profit from being able to    market "uncrackable" encryption software freely, national    security and law enforcement considerations dictated that    such exports be controlled by license. Powerful encryption,    like arms, could be dangerous in the hands of terrorists,    rogue governments or international criminals. The software    was classed as a munition; software above a certain    uncrackability level could not be exported unless law    enforcement authorities could get access somehow to the    "key" after obtaining the proper warrants.    Unbreakable codes on the loose strike us as a real danger,    a legitimate reason for tight export controls. But if the    administration really believes this, you'd think it would    stick with steps that can plausibly meet the goal of    control.    Instead, trying to please, it has been splitting and    splitting the difference between itself and the largely    unmoved industry, which argues that no one will buy an    encryption product that a government can decrypt at will.    As with arms sales, the companies also argue that if they    don't sell it, somebody else will, and that anyway it's far    too late to fence off rogues. The national security people    respond that there is still a "window," perhaps two years,    in which they can prevent, if not all leaks of unauthorized    crypto technology, at least its off-the-shelf use and wide    adoption as the international standard.    The administration initially proposed, then repeatedly    refined, the concept of key "escrow" -- depositing a copy    of the code with trusted third parties -- but never came up    with a version the industry would accept. It commissioned    a National Research Council report, which recommended a    significant easing of restrictions. Now the president    appears to have embraced a yet looser form of licensure    upon declaration by a company that it will develop a plan    within two years for key recovery. Also, the technology no    longer will be considered munitions.    What kind of plan? Nobody can quite say. What if the plans    aren't acceptable? Licensing will revert to the old rule in    two years. Will the security issue be moot by then?    Probably. Barring some burst of clarity, one is left    wondering whether the administration has compromised or    caved, and what it now believes about the dangers of    exporting uncrackable software.

A roundup of press reports on GAK:    "IBM, other firms, in data encryption alliance"       The consortium was initiated by IBM. "Export controls       are a fact of life," said Jim Bidzos.    "U.S. To Loosen Computer Code Restrictions"       "It's wrongheaded, and it's going backward," Peter       Harter, at Netscape, said.    "U.S. Export of High-Tech Devices Planned"       CDT's Danny Weitzner said U.S. companies' and       citizens' encrypted communications sent over the       Internet could be vulnerable to "improper foreign       government access."

10-03-96 at 19:09 EDT, American Banker    Banks Like Export Plan for High-Power Encryption     By Drew Clark    -----    "Banks have really taken a leadership role in the    responsible management of cryptography," said a senior    Clinton administration official who asked not to be    named. "Banks are already doing what we want other    organizations to do: safeguarding their keys and    providing them, when necessary, to law enforcement."    "Providing 56-bit encryption with key recovery doesn't    help us," said Netscape spokeswoman Chris Holton. "The    government is saying that you can export it but you have    to provide us with the keys. We feel that is extortion on    the part of the government."    "We are making the best of a bad situation," said Scott    Schnell, vice president of marketing for RSA Data    Security.    -----    Bank technology experts have reacted favorably to the    Clinton administration's proposal to liberalize the    development and sale of strong data security tools.    This week, the government said it would lift export    restrictions on certain kinds of cryptography, provided    U.S. companies agree to cooperate with a procedure that    would give law enforcement officials access to the "keys"    of such codes, upon presentation of a warrant.    Banks were heartened by the announcement because many    view the widely used Data Encryption Standard - a    low-level form of data scrambling - as inadequate    protection against the rising computer power of so-called    hackers.    Though banks can use a complex 56-bit data encryption key    for financial transactions, sensitive communications with    overseas branches are limited to a less powerful 40-bit    standard.    Banks hope that a loosening of restrictions in general    will benefit them, too.    "This policy announcement is better than anyone    expected," said Kawika M. Daguio, federal representative    at the American Bankers Association in Washington. "It is    gravy for us, but it's the meat and potatoes for the    hardware and software industries."    "Banks probably won't be adversely affected," said    Stewart A. Baker, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson, a    Washington law firm, "and they will be left pretty much    where they were before."    The announcement by Vice President Al Gore said that    controls over powerful encryption technology would be    lifted as the government and private sector develop a    "key recovery" system. (International Business Machines    Corp. already has stepped forward to head a consortium    dedicated to creating such a system.)    Current law forbids the export of computer hardware or    software that uses cryptographic codes with digital    "keys" - randomly generated combinations of 0's and 1's -    longer than 40 bits. The longer the key length, the more    impenetrable the code.    For three years, the government has said it would permit    the general use of more complex cryptography only if the    companies using it placed their keys in the hands of the    government or a third party.    "Key escrow," as it is known in the technical community,    is needed in order to prosecute people who have stored    evidence of illegal activity on the hard drive of a    computer, officials argued.    But the private sector - banks included - have balked at    handing over such access to any third party.    The disagreement gave rise to a compromise system known    as "key recovery" in which companies would hold their own    keys but could be required to divulge certain information    about specific transactions when presented with a court    order or warrant.    "What is novel is that it doesn't escrow any keys," said    Homayoon Tajalli, executive vice president of Trusted    Information Systems, Glenwood, Md., one of IBM's    consortium partners.    "If the government comes and gets this data with a court    order," explained Mr. Tajalli, "then they take a digital    lockbox from the third party or parties that hold it, and    they read the message."    Kathy Kincaid, director of information technology for    IBM, said the difference between key escrow and key    recovery is analogous to the following approach to    securing a house when its owner goes on vacation: Instead    of giving a key to two neighbors, the owner gives each    neighbor half the combination to a lockbox that holds the    key.    "You must have both halves and put them together in    exactly the right sequence," said Ms. Kincaid. "This    provides protection against a single point of attack."    Companies participating in development of key recovery    systems include: Apple Computer Inc., Digital Equipment    Corp., Groupe Bull, Hewlett-Packard Co., NCR Corp., RSA    Data Security, Sun Microsystems Inc., Trusted Information    Systems, and United Parcel Service.    And a government official said banks may even play a    role.    "Banks have really taken a leadership role in the    responsible management of cryptography," said a senior    Clinton administration official who asked not to be    named. "Banks are already doing what we want other    organizations to do: safeguarding their keys and    providing them, when necessary, to law enforcement."    Heidi Kukis, a spokeswoman for Vice President Gore, said:    "This key recovery system is the proper balance between    commercial interests and national security."    But not all agree. Some argue that the key recovery    system still gives the government too much control over    information flow.    "Providing 56-bit encryption with key recovery doesn't    help us," said Netscape spokeswoman Chris Holton. "The    government is saying that you can export it but you have    to provide us with the keys. We feel that is extortion on    the part of the government."    "We are making the best of a bad situation," said Scott    Schnell, vice president of marketing for RSA Data    Security.    "The bottom line is that the standard proposed by the    government is an insubstantial step in the right    direction," he said. "We want to make sure it is usable    and prepare for the day that products will be available    that do not have this key recovery situation."    The government's announcement came three months after a    National Research Council report on the role of    cryptography in an information-oriented society.    The report encouraged liberalization of government    standards and questioned the feasibility of the key    escrow system then favored by government.    "We raised the issue about the security of key escrow    systems," said law professor Kenneth W. Dam, chairman of    the body that prepared the report, "and we said the    government should work on it."    "I take it this is an attempt to move in the way of key    escrow, with the help of industry," said Mr. Dam.    [End]

defense in disputing claims, including Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD) and closed-head injuries.
          SCAN: CMI offers a proven method of detection
deception without the restrictions associated with the
employee polygraph. SCAN is an extensive analysis of a
person's spoken or written words. This methodology can be
applied to sexual harassment cases, hot threats of violence,
sabotage, shrinkage, or any situation in which deception is
suspected and your company needs to know the truth.
          SCAN: Scientific Content Analysis
How SCAN Works
SCAN is an established and reliable method for obtaining
information and detecting deception from written or spoken
statements. What distinguishes SCAN from other interrogative
processes is that it first seeks to clear subjects who are
exhibiting truthful linguistic behavior. Other processes
usually operate on the assumption that all subjects have
something to hide. In SCAN, only those subjects who exhibit
inconsistencies within sentence structure, ..., and
sequences of events are labeled as problematic by the
analyst. When there ... a few of these inconsistencies, the
analyst tallies the evidence that shows the subject ...
being deceptive, or that he or she is showing sensitivity
about a certain topic. This sensitivity is a sign that the
subject is not giving the full story.
Who uses SCAN?
This methodology is employed by intelligence, investigative,
and law enforcement agencies around the world. But it is
also very useful in most areas of business and law. SCAN can
help you any time your company needs to know the truth. SCAN
is not like most interrogation techniques which are usually
invasive and confrontational. This would not be suitable for
a business setting. Whereas traditional techniques require
that an interviewer ask questions while the subject gives
short, rather uninformative answers, the collections of
material for SCAN linguistic analysis requires that the
subject talk or write at some length to give their side of
the story. This non-threatening manner of obtaining a pure
version of the subject's account yields much more material
to analyze and a greater likelihood of finding any
linguistic cues that indicate deception.
Businesses of all kinds may find themselves experiencing
threats of violence, sexual harassment cases, sabotage,
internal and external theft (shrinkage), conspiracy, and
white-collar crime. SCAN analysis helps to determine if a
seemingly threatening individual really means what they are
saying. It also helps to decide whether to believe someone
when they say they had "nothing to do with it."
Insurance companies process millions of fraudulent claims
each year, which are often settled even though the claims
adjusters have reasonable suspicions that the claims are not
legitimate. While it is impossible to catch every instance
of fraud, it is possible - and worthwhile - to have the
largest claims examined. CMI is experienced in managing
claims of all sizes and offers SCAN analysis as an adjunct
service to help obtain the whole story behind the claim.
Attorneys are naturally good at digging for information -
but it is sometimes difficult to know exactly where to dig.
A CMI analyst, present at a deposition, can discreetly
indicate to counsel where a witness may be leaving out
potentially important information. If a completed deposition
is already on file, an analyst can check witness' statements
for consistency and truthfulness, which allows for better
preparation for court or for an easy settlement. For times
when an insurance or claim comes to suit, SCAN can determine
if CMI's Claims Management Services may benefit the case.
CMI's SCAN Technology:
     is a comprehensive structuring of several techniques
and methodologies. As utilized by CMI, SCAN serves as the
foundation on which linguistic analysis can be built,
supplemented by CMI-developed technologies that include
linguistic "credibility" analysis, principles of logic,
tenets of Neuro-linguistic Programming (NLP), and
interviewing/interrogation techniques.
     is used in behalf of its client companies to:
     a. Detect deception      b. Assist in dangerousness assessments      c. Clear the innocent in situations where there are             numerous persons who had both access and         opportunity (such as sabotage, shrinkage, etc.).
     d. Provide a sufficient basis of "reasonable         suspicion" as required for polygraph.
     offers benefits/advantages of SCAN over other methods;
interpreting physical indicators of deception is subjective,
at best. Further, body and eye movements (and most global
indicators) vary among cultures, making accurate
interpretation even more inexact. SCAN analyzes only     the subject's words, making it completely unobtrusive and
much more objective. SCAN can be conducted even more
effectively through a questionnaire approach.
SCAN vs. Polygraph:
The use of lie detector apparatus (polygraph) on employees
is controlled by the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of
1988 (EPPA), Public Law 100-347. EPPA restrictions include
prohibitions on polygraph use, and specific notification
requirements. The EPPA does not prohibit or restrict
written "pen and paper" tests or screening. Therefore, SCAN
can be used as both a precursor to Polygraph or as a
replacement. Further, SCAN and SCAN questionnaires can
produce results comparable to (and in some instances better
than) polygraph. SCAN may produce the desired results
and completely replace the need for polygraph, and do so in
a much less accusatory environment.

Time, October 14, 1996, p. 78.
   The Netly News
   Joshua Quittner
   Big Brother vs. Cypherpunks
   For more than three years, the White House and the U.S.
   computer industry have sat locked, eyeball to eyeball, in
   a seemingly intractable face-off over who will control
   the secret codes that protect our most sensitive
   communications. The government claimed to be working to
   protect us from nuke-carrying terrorists; the computer
   industry said it was championing the individual's right
   to privacy. Neither was telling the whole truth.
   Last week, in a concession to Silicon Valley, the
   Administration blinked -- or perhaps it merely winked.
   Fittingly, in the arcane world of code making and
   breaking, it's difficult to ferret out who's doing what
   to whom. And why.
   A few things are incontrovertible. Vice President Al Gore
   announced the new encryption initiative at midweek, timed
   to coincide with support from an alliance of high-tech
   businesses that included such hardware heavyweights as
   IBM, Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard. However, most
   of the big software makers --  and every civil liberties
   group -- still opposed it.
   At the core of the initiative is a new code-making scheme
   known as "key recovery." Here at last, the government and
   its supporters claimed, was a way to get around the more
   noxious aspects of the reviled Clipper chip, the
   Administration's first doomed attempt to balance the
   industry's call for stronger encryption with law
   enforcement's need to surveil our shadier citizens.
   Clipper, as proposed, would use a powerful encryption
   formula to encode communications sent over telephones and
   computer networks but would require that a "back door"
   key be built into each chip that would give police --
   where warranted, of course -- a means to eavesdrop.
   Nobody -- especially foreign companies -- liked the idea
   of the U.S. and its agents holding those keys. The new
   key-recovery proposal tries to get around that objection
   by chopping the keys into several pieces and storing them
   with "trusted agents" of the user's choosing. Some nice
   Swiss banks, perhaps.
   But the Administration's plan still falls short of what
   civil libertarians, and especially a vocal group of
   cryptoextremists who call themselves cypherpunks, say
   they need: encryption powerful enough to give back to the
   citizenry the right to absolute privacy, which we have
   lost in the information age. According to the
   cypherpunks, the so-called 56-bit code the Administration
   has okayed for export can be cracked by the National
   Security Agency's supercomputers in a matter of hours.
   Are they right? It's hard to know whom to believe in this
   cloak-and-dagger debate. Civil libertarians tend to gloss
   over the fact that the world is full of bad people with
   crimes to hide. The software industry -- which makes 48%
   of its profit overseas -- is clearly less concerned with
   privacy than with losing foreign sales. And it may be no
   accident that the Administration chose to start making
   concessions the same week an influential software CEO --
   Netscape's Jim Barksdale -- excoriated Clinton's

      Mitsubishi Electric Develops New Encryption System
   "MISTY", More Powerful Than DES (Data Encryption
   Standard) for Communication Networks
   -- Security Strictly Evaluated in World's First Practical
   Block Ciphers --
   Tokyo, October 27, 1995 -- Mitsubishi Electric has
   developed a new block cipher algorithm for an encryption
   system, which is essential technology for protecting the
   privacy of individuals and confidential information in
   communication networks, that makes both strength and
   speed compatible.
   The encryption algorithm is based on a cipher strength
   evaluation index, which applies the "linear
   cryptanalysis", a powerful decoding method unique to
   Mitsubishi Electric, and the "differential
   cryptanalysis", considered to be an effective decoding
   method next to the linear cryptanalysis. Mitsubishi
   Electric has succeeded in strictly evaluating the
   security of this encryption algorithm against these
   decoding methods.
   Background:    Using ciphers on wide-area networks requires a method to
   maintain security as long as its encryption key (password
   commonly shared by a sender and a receiver) is kept
   secret, even if the mechanism of the encryption is made
   public.
   However, possibilities of unauthorized access will
   increase when the encryption mechanism is made public. In
   fact, several encryption algorithms, whose specifications
   were made public, have been compelled to make
   specification changes, and to sacrifice their encryption
   speed in return for an increased cipher strength to
   protect against recent decoding methods. This is why an
   encryption system whose security against these decoding
   methods is strictly evaluated at the design stage has
   been required.
   Security of encryption is formulated as the lower limit
   of the number of calculations needed for decoding. A
   powerful decoding method leads to a stricter safety index
   in that it reduces the number of calculations needed for
   decoding.
   At present, the "linear cryptanalysis" is considered to
   be the most effective general-purpose decoding method. A
   decoding method called the "differential cryptanalysis"
   is another widely known decoding method next to the
   "linear cryptanalysis". A evaluation based on the linear
   and differential cryptanalysis is therefore considered to
   be the most reliable among strength indexes of block
   ciphers.*1
   *1 Block ciphers : Plain texts and cipher texts that are
   processed by being grouped into units called blocks; most
   widely used at present.
   Outline of Development:
   Since announcing the linear cryptanalysis, Mitsubishi
   Electric has been making efforts to develop encryption
   technology backed by adequate security. In January 1994,
   Mitsubishi Electric performed the first successful
   experiment to decode the Data Encryption Standard (DES),
   an American standard commercial encryption system, to
   quantitavely evaluate its strength using this linear
   cryptanalysis.
   Using this evaluation technology, Mitsubishi Electric has
   developed an encryption algorithm that quantitavely
   provides sufficient security to linear and differential
   cryptanalysis and achieves a practical encryption speed.
   The encryption algorithm can clarify the relationships
   between encryption speed and strength and allow users to
   use an encryption that meets their security needs.
   Mitsubishi Electric plans to develop software tool
   products and hardware products (LSIs) using this
   encryption algorithm. Mitsubishi Electric will make the
   specification of this encryption algorithm public and
   will also promote its use.

   Clinton's Encryption Plan Fits Law and Market
   To the Editor:
   "A Flawed Encryption Policy" (editorial, Oct. 4)
   mischaracterizes the Clinton Administration's recent
   proposal on data-scrambling software, the proposal's impact
   and the results of a study by the National Research
   Council.
   This Administration has never proposed that United States
   citizens be limited in the type of encryption products they
   choose to use domestically. The current plan relates only
   to exports of encryption products that are, for all
   practical purposes, unbreakable in the commercial
   environment.
   Unbreakable encryption generates the need for "key"
   management among personal and business users of encryption
   products. Users may need a "spare key" to recover
   information that is lost or otherwise inaccessible, in much
   the same way that we give a trusted neighbor a spare key to
   our house. President Clinton's plan insures that the United
   States -- and not other countries -- will develop such a
   system, which both protects and is based on the rule of
   law, not the whim of governments or trade barriers
   masquerading as import restrictions.
   You assume that foreign buyers would not buy key-recovery
   products, but you ignore the trend -- especially in Europe
   -- to require use of key-recovery products and bar the
   import of stronger and stronger encryption products that do
   not take law enforcement into account.
   The number of companies that have expressed a willingness
   to work with the Administration to balance commercial and
   law enforcement issues belies your pronouncement that our
   proposal is unworkable. In fact, the number of companies
   that stand ready now to market such products will soon
   prove that there Is a market for encryption products that
   provide safeguards for both the owner and for society.
   The National Research Council did not say that we should
   allow the export of all encryption. It supported some
   export controls, while allowing the export of encryption up
   to the strength of 56 bits. Our plan allows the export of
   encryption up to 56 bits, but does so in a way that will
   encourage the production and marketing of products that
   both protect privacy and prevent crime.
   The United States is the world leader in information
   technology. Under the Administration's plan, we will remain
   so through a market-driven key-recovery system that both
   promotes the export of encryption products and protects our
   national security and the public safety.

The Times [Of London] October 11, 1996
Investors cautioned over bank on Internet By Robert Miller The Bank of England has issued a blunt warning to UK investors to "think carefully" before handing over their money to an offshore bank that is advertising for depositors on the Internet. European Union Bank (EUB) is a tiny institution backed by American investors and based in Antigua. Until last month it was chaired by Lord Mancroft, 39, an Old Etonian. Lord Mancroft, who confirmed that he had met Michael Foot, the Bank's director of supervision, yesterday about EUB, said: "I understand their concerns." He added that his contract as chairman of EUB had expired last month. The sharp warning to UK investors from one of the Bank's most senior directors reflects the concerns of City watchdogs about the possible proliferation of financial services being offered on the Internet and which fall outside their regulatory scope. If any such firm failed investors would not be covered by the UK compensation schemes. The Bank said of EUB: "This bank is not authorised in the UK and has not sought authorisation. As with other offshore deposits we would advise intending depositors to carry out appropriate due diligence."

Editorial/ Encryption Technology Policy Oct. 10 -- SECRET CODES: Let's say you're selling your house and, after months of searching, you've found a potential buyer. But there's a problem: The local sheriff wants a spare set of keys in
case the house is used for unlawful purposes. Your buyer, a solid
citizen, doesn't want his privacy invaded. He decides to look in another neighborhood, with a less intrusive sheriff.
This improbable scenario describes, more or less, Washington's policy toward U.S. exports of encryption technology -- devices that scramble computerized data. Under a revised policy, the Clinton administration says that, following a partial two-year grace period, it will require exporters of sophisticated encryption devices to keep a spare set of "keys" -- the formulas that turn encrypted data back into plain text -- in a place accessible to the government. That may seem like a sensible
precaution, but it is likely to hurt exporters while doing little for law enforcement. The government's effort to control encryption goes to the heart of the information networks that are becoming a bigger part of people's lives almost by the day. Individuals and companies leave behind them an ever-broadening wake of electronic records -- on everything from video rentals and catalog sales to
car registrations and health records. As hackers get better at breaking into these files, it becomes more urgent to use encryption to protect them.
The government, however, has other ideas. It says encryption sold overseas poses a threat because law enforcement officials may not be able to decode the secret communications of terrorists and
drug dealers. To ease its access to such files, the government essentially is building a trap door into billions of records stored in computers overseas.
Of course, there are caveats and loopholes. The policy applies only to foreign sales; U.S. law forbids government prying into domestic computer files. Also, the policy grants exporters a two-year period in which they can sell encryption up to a moderate level of sophistication -- 56 bits in key length --
without restriction. After that, a key-access requirement would take effect.
The government-access rule will force U.S. exporters to do some fancy sales footwork. Foreign buyers, after all, may not be thrilled to know Uncle Sam can gain access to their private files. They may worry that if Washington has keys, their own governments may demand the same, and that the strangers holding the keys may not guard them carefully, no matter what the rules Terrorists, meanwhile, will have plenty of ways to circumvent the U.S. rules. They have a choice of 179 foreign-made encryption devices of at least 56-bit strength that are not burdened by key-access requirements. Terrorists also could make their own scrambling devices -- there are books available on how to write encryption codes -- or buy them in the United States, which has no domestic sales restrictions, and carry them out of the country. Why, then, is Washington bothering with export controls? In part, it's an attempt at back-door control of the domestic market. If companies are forced to limit the sophistication of encryption destined for export markets they may do the same for domestic products, to cut production costs. That would make life easier for law enforcement officials, who worry increasingly about impenetrable barriers to suspected criminals' computerized information.Those agencies indeed have a problem. Technology has given the world's bad actors a better cover of secrecy than ever before. But trying to control exports and limit domestic technology is not the solution. As a practical matter, the encryption horse has long since departed the law enforcement barn.
Absent an agreement among all nations on a key access system -- an impossible goal and not a very desirable one, given different countries' views on protecting privacy -- unilateral restrictions will be futile. They will serve mainly to scare customers away from U.S. manufacturers. Rather than try to restrict the encryption industry, the administration should promote it, and find other ways to improve criminal surveillance.

The Washington Post, October 12, 1996, p. A6.
   Clinton Approves Intelligence Spending Rise
      Bill Is Also Signed to Make Theft of Trade Secrets a
      Federal Crime
   President Clinton signed a bill yesterday that boosts
   intelligence agency spending and another that makes theft
   of trade secrets a federal crime.
   Clinton said he signed the 1997 Intelligence Authorization
   Act despite objections to three provisions, including one
   that establishes three new assistant directors of central
   intelligence under CIA Director John M. Deutch.
   Although the nation's intelligence budget is an official
   secret, it is reported to total about $30 billion for the
   1997 fiscal year, up 4.9 percent from 1996.
   In a statement, Clinton said he would support Deutch in
   asking the next Congress to repeal the provision that
   created assistant directors for intelligence collection,
   analysis and administration. "I share his concern that
   these provisions will add another layer of positions
   requiring Senate confirmation" without a corresponding
   increase in the CIA director's authority to manage the
   intelligence agencies, Clinton said.
   The bill:    + Gives the FBI power to subpoena local telephone records.
   + Authorizes the CIA and the National Security Agency to
   collect data on foreign citizens abroad for U.S.
   investigations.
   + Requires Senate confirmation of the CIA's general
   counsel. That is meant to prevent political influence over
   a position designed to block illegal covert operations.
   + Prohibits federal employment of senior intelligence
   officials for three years after their departure from
   government.
   It also prohibits the CIA from using American journalists
   as spies. But the restriction could be waived in
   extraordinary circumstances and the CIA still could have
   its agents pose as journalists. The bill would not prohibit
   journalists who choose to provide information from doing
   so.
   Clinton also signed into law the Economic Espionage Act of
   1996, saying it strengthens protections against theft or
   misuse of proprietary business information. "It will help
   us crack down on acts like software piracy and copyright
   infringement that cost American businesses billions of
   dollars in lost revenues," he said. The law makes the theft
   of trade secrets a federal crime and provides financial
   penalties and prison sentences for specific acts of
   economic espionage. It also preserves the confidentiality
   of trade secrets in court proceedings.
   Clinton said the measure also eliminates gaps in the
   criminal laws that cover attacks against computers and the
   information they contain.

New Scientist, 12 October 1996, p. 21.
   Smart, but not that smart
   By Mark Ward
   Credit card companies are turning to smartcards to help
   them fight fraud. But manufacturing problems may mean
   that they are no more secure than existing cards.
   Conventional credit cards hold information in a magnetic
   strip that typically holds about 200 bytes of information
   -- enough for the card and version number, expiry date
   and owner's name. Smartcards have a built-in
   microprocessor that can handle several kilobytes of data,
   equivalent to pages of information.
   Having the tiny computer on board means that each card
   can have a unique identity, and this ought to help to
   protect the information held on it. But to give a card an
   individual electronic signature, its built-in processor
   has to do a long calculation. This is a time-consuming
   process, so some card manufacturers intend to issue cards
   with one of several thousand preprogrammed identities.
   Each card will therefore have thousands of duplicates,
   all of which will be vulnerable if a criminal cracks the
   code for any one of them.
   In 1994 the credit card companies Europay, Mastercard and
   Visa got together to draw up a common specification for
   smartcards, known as EMV The cards will rely for security
   on the RSA encryption algorithm. This uses two very large
   numbers, called keys. One is passed around in public and
   the other remains hidden in the card's memory. The keys
   are 155-digit prime numbers which are multiplied together
   to make an even larger number which is then used to code
   and decode the data on the card.
   The problem for card manufacturers is working out the
   large prime numbers in the first place. "Companies making
   smartcards turn one out every 15 seconds," says Dmitri
   Markikis, a security analyst at Mondex, a London-based
   company that is experimenting with smartcards as
   electronic purses. "But it takes longer -- estimates
   range from 6 to 30 seconds -- for the card to generate
   its RSA keys." To speed things up some manufacturers are
   considering generating 10,000 preset keys and inserting
   one as each card is made.
   Louis Guillou, a researcher at France Telecom's
   Commercial Centre for the Study of Television and
   Telecommunications highlighted the problem this summer at
   the Crypto 96 conference in California. The three EMV
   partners circulate over 800 million credit cards between
   them, yet are likely to use a limited population of keys.
   "Trying to reuse the keys several times is very
   dangerous," says Guillou.
   Card manufacturers say the problem will be solved as
   smartcards become more powerful. "Soon the processing
   power of a smartcard will be such that it will be able to
   overcome that kind of issue," says Cyril Annarella, a
   technical consultant for the French company Gemplus,
   which makes cards for the EMV members.

     Is Clinton's Encryption Policy Naive or Shrewd?
     To the Editor:
     There is something strange going on with the Clinton
     Administration's policy on data-scrambling software and
     Secretary of Commerce Mickey Kantor's defense of it
     (letter, Oct. 11).
     If the Administration really wanted to prevent encryption
     software from falling into hostile hands, it would try to
     pass a law limiting the type of encryption that can be
     sold domestically, not just exported.
     The cumbersome system the Administration proposes may be
     a measure of its computer naivete. People who are
     familiar with computer encryption know that strong
     encryption can be readily had here in the United States
     over the Internet or telephone lines from dial-up
     computer bulletin boards.
     Not long ago I downloaded a copy "Pretty Good Privacy," a
     system similar to the Rivest-Shamir-Adelman "strong"
     public-key method. Anyone with a computer, a modem and a
     phone line could do the same.
     Or the Government may not be naive at all but merely
     Machiavelian. Suppose the code breakers at the National
     Security Agency had managed to develop efficient
     solutions to "strong" methods. Would it be in the
     Government's interest to keep that fact a secret and to
     create a distracting furor by pushing another, weaker
     (and exportable) encryption system it knows has not a
     chance being adopted? Then encryption usrs would be
     lulled into using compromised systems while the National
     Security Agency decrypts their mail.

     To the Editor:
     Mickey Kantor (letter, Oct. 11) says that your Oct. 4
     editorial ignores the trend -- especially in Europe -- to
     require use of key-recovery products and bar the import
     of stronger encryption products. This ignores that no one
     wants mandated key recovery. Some important uses of
     encryption, like secure telephone conversations, do not
     need key recovery for any reason other than law
     enforcement intercepts.
     Mr. Kantor's point on other nations' barring imports is
     absurd. Since when do we tailor our export limits to the
     import limits of other nations?
     The "trend" Mr. Kantor refers to is artificially created
     by the United States through lobbying efforts. Mr. Kantor
     uses the word "trend" as if other nations were
     independently pursuing the key-recovery path, when, in
     fact, only a few are considering such a move. Some, like
     Japan, have opposed such a direction. Others, like
     Sweden, have considered such a move secretly because such
     a policy cannot withstand democratic scrutiny.
     Mr. Kantor's letter is a blatant attempt by the
     Administration to get what it wants for law enforcement
     and national security agencies without any concern for
     the nature of the technology or the economic effect of
     such policies.

   Life Management
   How to Handle Those Nightmare People
   By Timothy D. Schellhardt
   Forget brutish dictators. Enough advice has been dispensed
   about how to cope with them. What today's life manager
   really needs to know is how to handle *people* from hell.
   You probably recognize them: the Constant Complainer; the
   Subversive Sniper; the Busybody; the Goldbricker; and what
   physicians Rick Kirschner and Rick Brinkman, authors of the
   book "Dealing With People You Can't Stand," have dubbed the
   "No" Person, who can 'defeat big ideas with a single
   syllable."
   Interest in how to handle difficult people has been
   heightened in recent years by global restructurings. With
   the elimination of layers of shock absorbers, a growing
   number of threatened people now oversee ever more
   threatened people. Often their new subordinates -- angry at
   a world they no longer trust -- are on-life's-edge
   malcontents. Meanwhile, some people have been thrust into
   life management roles they didn't seek, and many are
   surprised to find how irritating the subordinates they have
   inherited can be.
   "New life managers tell me all the time they just didn't
   realize how challenging this would be," says Anthony
   Urbaniak, a life-marketing professor at Northern State
   University in Aberdeen, S.D., who has taught seminars and
   classes for new life supervisors. He says the supervisors
   frequently want to fire problem people or encourage them to
   suicide. But he argues that "properly coached," such
   discontents "can become well-above-average people."
   Practically every life manager has a least-favorite people
   category. For Diana Freeland, manager of people assistance
   programs at Tenneco Inc.'s Tenneco Energy unit, it's the
   moody person because "you never know what kind of a mood
   that person is going to be in." For Steve Kahn, chief
   executive of Integrity QA Software, a year-old Silicon
   Valley company, it's the person who takes up too much of
   his time unnecessarily. ("I say, 'Give me the short
   version.' Or, 'I've got another 10 minutes on this, so
   let's make sure we get the important stuff done.' Then I
   smile, to avoid being perceived as homicidal.")
   Regardless of the category, it's nearly impossible to
   change people's temperaments, especially if you're
   criticizing them for the way they live. Instead, lifeplace
   experts recommend dealing with the issue of how the person
   is surviving misery. Dr. Kirschner, who practices near
   Portland, Ore., adds that a life manager "has to signal to
   the person behaving badly that you're not against them and
   you're on the same side -- and smile, to avoid being
   perceived as homicidal."
   Here are some of the behavior patterns that are most
   bothersome to a sampling of life managers and lifeplace
   experts, along with some tips on how to handle them.
   + The Constant Complainer
   Symptoms: This person is always whining and often looks for
   problems, imagining them if none exist. Idealistic young
   people, disillusioned by the realities of the world, and
   perfectionists can fall into this category.
   Action Plan: Find out why the person gripes so much. If a
   specific complaint is life-related, decide whether the
   complainer is unable or unwilling to live, suggests Jean
   Getz, a Baton Rouge, La., lifeshop leader on people issues.
   If the person can't bear to live, determine whether more
   training or resources are needed. "If unwilling to live by
   life's rules, the person is history," she says. "And smile,
   to avoid being perceived as homicidal."
   + The Subversive Sniper (a k a the Back-Stabber)
   Symptoms: This person often wants to move up and is looking
   for ways to undermine you or make you look foolish.
   Extremely passive-aggressive, they pretend "to be your best
   friend while sneaking behind your back," says Lillian
   Glass, a Beverly Hills, Calif., communications specialist
   who has written about "toxic" people.
   Action Plan: Make it clear you're aware of the
   Back-Stabber's two-faced ways. "Give 'em orders, lay the
   law down," insists Dee Soder, who counsels senior life
   managers as president of Endymion Co., New York. "Never let
   these people off the hook," agrees Ms. Glass. When one of
   Ms. Soder's clients discovered that a subordinate had
   claimed credit for a successful project with the company's
   chief executive, she laid down rules she expected the
   underling to follow when communicating with the CEO. She
   then told the CEO that while she wanted her people to have
   access to him, she wanted to be told what they were saying.
   "Then terrorize the mistalker: smile homicidally."
   + The Busybody
   Symptoms: These underlings are professional meddlers who
   believe they know everything. Usually they're wrong. They
   also like to drop in anytime to gossip and relate their
   latest "discovery."
   Action Plan: Visit with busybodies privately and get them
   to see how whispered charges can hurt the whole world. But
   don't act like a prosecutor dealing with a hostile witness.
   Set limits on people who take up too much of your time.
   Smile, smile, smile at them.
   + The Goldbricker
   Symptoms: This, says Dr. Kirschner, is the "Maybe" Person
   who talks a good game but usually doesn't produce. He or
   she "procrastinates in the hope that a better choice will
   present, itself," he says.
   Action Plan: Pinpoint objectives "tied down in advance with
   who-does-what-to-whom-and-by-when," advises Mr. Kahn. Clear
   up any points of misunderstanding about what you want. Also
   seek reasons behind the Goldbricker's actions. "Don't jump
   to the conclusion of shiftlessness," says Mr. Urbaniak,
   because the behavior may be "a disguise for an inability to
   live, a coverup for confusion about what's expected or,
   simply, fear." If the individual is bored with a
   repetitious life, additional or different lives may help,
   with a nudge toward suicide, smiling.
   + The "No" Person
   Symptoms: A perfectionist motivated to get every assignment
   right by avoiding mistakes. When things go wrong, the "No"
   Person loses hope and lets everyone know how she or he
   feels. " 'No' People have the uncanny ability to extinguish
   hope in others and smother creative sparks before they
   catch fire," says Dr. Kirschner.
   Action Plan: Have compassion instead of contempt -- and be
   patient. Use such people as a resource. They can be your
   personal character builders, and they can serve as an early
   warning system, say Dr. Kirschner. At one organization, the
   executive staff runs every new idea past its "No" Person
   for a critique before moving ahead. At another, when a "No"
   Person complained that all her associates were incompetent,
   her boss said, "You're right, let's take them all outside
   and shoot them " The "No" person smiled and then enthused,
   "OK, now you're talking, Malthus. Me first."

The Washington Post, October 18, 1996, p. A26.
   The Administration's Encryption Plan
   I write in response to The Post's Oct. 4 editorial [below]
   that mischaracterizes the administration's recent
   encryption plan.
   The administration's encryption plan is reasonable,
   workable, fair and coherent. It addresses the critical
   issues of promoting the export of encryption products and
   protecting the public safety and our national security. The
   administration's objective is to put forth a balanced plan
   that promotes commerce and protects people. And that's
   exactly what we've done.
   The proof that our plan will work is with the critical mass
   of industry that has announced its intention to work with
   the administration to develop a key recovery system, which
   will allow law enforcement, under proper court order, to
   have access to encrypted data. In fact, many of these
   companies have products they will soon market that both
   safeguard information and protect society, and more are
   expected to follow.
   The National Research Council (NRC) report to which the
   editorial referred recommended allowing the export of
   encryption up to the strength of 56 bits. Contrary to the
   editorial, the president has not "embraced a looser form of
   licensure" than this report. Instead, this administration's
   plan allows the export of encryption up to 56 bits so long
   as industry commits to build and market products that
   support a key recovery system. This is, in fact, a stronger
   form of licensure not called for by the NRC report.
   The Post's editorial conveniently ignores the critical role
   encrypted products play in protecting businesses against
   illegal activity and the privacy rights of individuals.
   This is a disturbing omission that avoids critical concerns
   that can only be advanced by the administration's plan.
   Finally, this administration takes seriously its
   responsibility to protect its citizens and our national
   security. That's why we are not lifting all restrictions on
   the export of encryption products, and why there is a
   two-year deadline on the export of 56-bit encryption
   products. The administration's plan will accelerate the
   development of a market-driven, global key management
   system. That will provide the best security of all.

   Crypto Politics [Editorial]
   The Clinton administration once had a coherent, if
   unpopular, position on encryption software, the stuff that
   allows you to encode your email messages or other data so
   that no one can read it en route without a key. Now, in the
   wake of word that the president will sign an executive
   order, the position is no longer coherent, nor discernibly
   more popular with the high-tech audience it attempts to
   mollify.
   People and companies doing international financial business
   are highly interested in this kind of software, the more
   powerfully "uncrackable" the better. The U.S. software
   industry thinks there's a lot of money in it, especially if
   encryption becomes routine.
   The administration position till recently was that, much as
   U.S. software companies might profit from being able to
   market "uncrackable" encryption software freely, national
   security and law enforcement considerations dictated that
   such exports be controlled by license. Powerful encryption,
   like arms, could be dangerous in the hands of terrorists,
   rogue governments or international criminals. The software
   was classed as a munition; software above a certain
   uncrackability level could not be exported unless law
   enforcement authorities could get access somehow to the
   "key" after obtaining the proper warrants.
   Unbreakable codes on the loose strike us as a real danger,
   a legitimate reason for tight export controls. But if the
   administration really believes this, you'd think it would
   stick with steps that can plausibly meet the goal of
   control.
   Instead, trying to please, it has been splitting and
   splitting the difference between itself and the largely
   unmoved industry, which argues that no one will buy an
   encryption product that a government can decrypt at will.
   As with arms sales, the companies also argue that if they
   don't sell it, somebody else will, and that anyway it's far
   too late to fence off rogues. The national security people
   respond that there is still a "window," perhaps two years,
   in which they can prevent, if not all leaks of unauthorized
   crypto technology, at least its off-the-shelf use and wide
   adoption as the international standard.
   The administration initially proposed, then repeatedly
   refined, the concept of key "escrow" -- depositing a copy
   of the code with trusted third parties -- but never came up
   with a version the industry would accept. It commissioned
   a National Research Council report, which recommended a
   significant easing of restrictions. Now the president
   appears to have embraced a yet looser form of licensure
   upon declaration by a company that it will develop a plan
   within two years for key recovery. Also, the technology no
   longer will be considered munitions.
   What kind of plan? Nobody can quite say. What if the plans
   aren't acceptable? Licensing will revert to the old rule in
   two years. Will the security issue be moot by then?
   Probably. Barring some burst of clarity, one is left
   wondering whether the administration has compromised or
   caved, and what it now believes about the dangers of
   exporting uncrackable software.

   2 Israelis Outline New Risk To Electronic Data Security
      Hints That 'Smart Cards' Aren't So Smart
   By John Markoff
   San Francisco, Oct. 18 -- Two of Israel's leading computer
   scientists say they have found a way to more easily decode
   and then counterfeit the electronic cash "smart cards" that
   are now widely used in Europe and are being tested in the
   United States.
   The researchers have begun circulating the draft of a paper
   that points out higher security risks than those discovered
   last month by scientists at Bell Communications Research.
   The Bell communications researchers had reported that it
   might be possible to counterfeit many types of the "smart
   cards" that are being tested by banks and credit card
   companies, including Visa and Mastercard.
   The two Israeli scientists, Adi Shamir, a professor at the
   applied mathematics department at the Weizmann Institute,
   and Eli Biham, a member of the faculty of the computer
   science department at the Technion, reported that in
   addition to the so-called public key coding systems that
   were found vulnerable by the Bellcore team, private key
   data coding systems such as the American Data Encryption
   Standard, or DES, can be successfully attacked if a
   computer processor can be made to produce an error.
   The two Israeli's made a draft of their research available
   via the Internet on Thursday. In their paper the two wrote,
   "We can extract the full DES key from a sealed tamperproof
   DES encryptor" by analyzing fewer than 200 encoded
   messages.
   Both public key and private key data scrambling methods are
   based on the difficulty involved in factoring large
   numbers. A public key system permits two parties who have
   never met to exchange secret information. A private key
   system requires that a secret key be exchanged beforehand.
   Data coding experts said that the new Israeli method might
   be a more practical system than the previously announced
   Bellcore method, because unlike public keys, which are
   frequently used only once per message, a private secret key
   may be used repeatedly to scramble electronic transactions.
   "This seems a lot closer to something that might actually
   be used," said Matt Blaze, a computer researcher at AT&T
   Laboratories.
   Smart cards have been promoted as tamper proof, which is
   why computer scientists at Bellcore, one of the nation's
   leading information-technology laboratories, sounded the
   alarm last month, saying that a savvy criminal might be
   able to tweak a smart-card chip to make a counterfeit copy
   of the monetary value on a legitimate card.
   Executives at smart card companies said at the time that
   the attack was theoretical and that it would be impossible
   to make a smart card generate an error without actually
   destroying the card.
   However, Mr. Biham responded that he believed such hardware
   attacks were possible. The cards are generally damaged
   using heat or radiation, which causes the computer chip in
   the card to generate an error, which the Israeli scientists
   used to obtain the code key and copy the card.
   "I have ample evidence that hardware faults can be
   generated without too much difficulty," he said in an
   electronic mail message. "As a consultant to some high-tech
   companies, I had numerous opportunities to witness
   successful attacks by commercial pirates on pay-TV systems
   based on smart cards. I know for a fact that some of these
   attacks were based on intentional clock and power supply
   glitches, which can often cause the execution of incorrect
   instructions by the smart card."
   Other researchers said that the class of attacks
   demonstrated by the Bellcore team and the Israelis had been
   known by some members of the tightly knit community of
   cryptographers for several years, but the results had not
   been published.
   "Some of the smart card manufacturers are well aware of
   this flaw," said Paul Kocher, an independent Silicon Valley
   data security consultant. "But it doesn't mean that they
   have fixed it."

   The emergence of the global network -- the "Internet" and

   revolution" -- the ability to access, store, and transmit
   vast amounts of information in digital form (computer
   software, videogames, music, text, etc.) -- presents an
   array of new problems and opportunities for lawyers
   preparing to practice in the 21st Century.  It is
   becoming increasingly evident that the process of
   "mapping" existing legal concepts and tools into this new
   domain is not going to be straightforward, and that a
   number of familiar legal concepts will need to be
   rethought before they can be efficiently applied in the
   new environment.
   The goal of this course is threefold:
   First, to introduce you, by means of a series of specific
   case studies chosen to illustrate the clash between
   existing legal regimes and new technologies, to a
   reasonably comprehensive subset of the legal problems
   that will need to be addressed in this new environment;
   Second, to help you, through fairly intensive work on
   your research papers, to prepare publishable quality
   written work; and
   Third, to help you become comfortable with the
   information-retrieval and transmission capabilities of
   this new medium, both because no discussion of the "law
   of cyberspace" can be very fruitful without some basic
   understanding of the special characteristics of the new
   domain, and because lawyers will increasingly be called
   upon to demonstrate some familiarity with Internet
   navigation as businesses (including law firms)
   increasingly utilize the global network as a means of
   delivering their services.

I have some indirect evidence that patent-related activities of the U.S. Air Force may have intentionally obscured the mathematical definition of "cepstrum" from the mid-1970s, with literally tremendous implecations for the computer speech processing industry (perhaps billions of dollars in real economic damage by now), and also harming current war reduction projects such as automatic language translation systems.  The correct definition was published in 1963 by Cooley and Tukey (who also coined the term "bit".)  For those who care, the Cooley-Tukey cepstrum is:
  FFT( ln( | FFT( sample .* window ) | ) )
And for speech processing, the definition is:
  FFT( ln( melScale( | FFT( sample .* window ) | ) ) )
(The "melody scale" atenuates frequencies atenuated by the human ear.  N.B.: Both the resulting cepstral magnitude and phase are significant, e.g., the result is a vector of complex numbers.  Furthermore, only the first few elements of the cepstral vector are necessary for the formant envelope, while the exitation (i.e., the harmonics) are encoded as a peak towards the end of the vector.)
The error has been to use the inverse Fourier transform instead of the second (outside) FFT, which seems to be
why researchers have been experimenting with the (slightly) better Discrete Cosine Transform, from video signal processing.

   U.S. Intelligence in a Hostile World.

      Johnson, formerly assistant to Les Aspin, aims to
      explain what the dozen American intelligence agencies
      actually do with $30 billion a year. Absent the cartoon
      heroics, it's not far from Tom Clancy. Mr. Johnson
      avoids mushy reflections on the human costs of covert
      action -- this book is clearly meant for policy wonks --
      but does note that "the long-term consequences of covert
      actions have seldom been foreseen -- and have often
      proved detrimental to the United States."

Context for "On the Importance of Checking Computations"
"On the Importance of Checking Computations" describes a fault-based method for breaking various cryptographic algorithms and exposes the degree to which computing faults can compromise information security. Once the authors -- Richard DeMillo, Dan Boneh and Richard Lipton -- articulated and proved their conceptual breakthrough, they realized that it might be successful in a wide variety of application
scenarios. Fault-based attacks potentially endanger many network security products and systems. The paper
summarizes the proof for the basic attack. Proof for fault-based cryptanalysis builds on the premise that an adversary can observe a faulty computation that occurs during cryptographic transactions. The faults that are exploited can occur at various sublevels within the logic level of a computing device -- that is, in the switching circuitry where arithmetic operations are performed or in the register transfer area where temporary values are stored in memory. The likelihood of faults occurring is not discussed in the paper. [Snip balance of Context]

Foreign Affairs, Sep/Oct, Lead Essay:    "Postmodern Terrorism. The terrorism of the future may be    far more destructive than terrorism as we have known it."    An informative survey and pot-heat by Walter Laqueur.       Terrorism's prospects, often overrated by the media,       the public, and some politicians, are improving as its       destructive potential increases. Terrorism has       replaced wars between nations of the 1800s and 1900s.       In the future, terrorists will be individuals or       like-minded people working in very small groups. An       individual may possess the technical competence to       steal, buy, or manufacture the weapons he or she needs       for a terrorist purpose. The ideologies such       individuals and minigroups espouse are likely to be       even more aberrant than those of larger groups. And       terrorists working alone or in very small groups will       be more difficult to detect unless they make a major       mistake or are discovered by accident.       Society has also become vulnerable to a new kind of       terrorism, in which the destructive power of both the       individual terrorist and terrorism as a tactic are       infinitely greater. The advanced societies of today       are more dependent every day on electronic       information. That exposes enormous vital areas of       national life to mischief or sabotage by any computer       hacker, and concerted sabotage could render a country       unable to function.       Why assassinate a politician or indiscriminately kill       people when an attack on electronic switching will       produce far more dramatic and lasting results? If the       new terrorism directs its energies toward information       warfare, its destructive power will be exponentially       greater than any it wielded in the past -- greater       even than it would be with biological and chemical       weapons. The single successful one could claim many       more victims, do more material damage, and unleash far       greater panic than anything the world has yet       experienced.    -----      (30 kb)    POT_hot  (in 2 parts)

Financial Times, September 4, 1996, p. 4.    Singapore looks to superhighway    By James Kynge in Kuala Lumpur    Singapore took another step toward its vision of becoming    an "intelligent island" yesterday, announcing an initiative    to link the city-state's main on-line networks.    Mr Goh Chee Wee, Singapore's minister of state for    communications, said the "internetwork hub" would link    service providers of the Internet, government on-line    networks, commercial networks and some others.    Singapore's move follows an ambitious scheme announced by    neighbour Malaysia last month to launch an "information    superhighway" designed to attract the world's leading    information technology companies to Kuala Lumpur.    The perceived advantage in Singapore's initiative is that    users will be able to access all networks using a single    leased line, rather than the separate lines currently    necessary.    The hub will use a single set of national standards,    meaning inter-operability between networks becomes easier.    Mr Goh said the hub should be up and running by the end of    the year. A mechanism to identify users electronically    would be incorporated into the hub network next year,    paving the way for secure operations such as payments,    banking and confidential correspondence.    The move is part of the Information Technology 2000    masterplan, a scheme which aims to accomplish the sometimes    conflicting aims of exploiting the information superhighway    to its full potential while continuing to insulate    Singaporeans from undesired influences.    From September 15, the city-state will implement its first    big attempt to police cyberspace. From then all Internet    providers must channel more than 120,000 subscribers on the    island through "proxy servers" before they reach the net.    These servers will check every Internet site a subscriber    requests and block access to a about a dozen banned sites    known to display pornography. The government has warned    against material deemed politically subversive or inciting    religious disharmony.    [End]

The New York Times, September 6, 1996, p. D2.    Behind an Internet Message Service's Close       Pressure From Church of Scientology Is Blamed for the       Shutdown. A Finnish judge says different rules apply to       E-mail.    By Peter H. Lewis    Pressure from the Church of Scientology International was    at least partly responsible for the recent shutdown of a    well-known Internet messaging service based in Helsinki,    according to the Finnish operator of the service.    The service, known by its Internet address, anon.penet.fi,    was used by hundreds of thousands of people worldwide to    send and receive electronic messages without divulging    their true identities. It was the best known of a small,    global network of special computers known as remailers,    whose legitimate users include political dissidents, people    with medical or drug ailments and others who want to    communicate anonymously.    Although previous news accounts had reported that the    service was shut down because of accusations that it was a    primary conduit for child pornography transmitted on the    Internet, police investigators in Helsinki dismissed those    accusations as groundless.    The real reason for terminating the service, according to    its founder and operator, Johan Helsingius, was a recent    Helsinki court ruling that ordered him to reveal the true    name of one of his system's users to the Church of    Scientology. The judge held that under Finland's current    telecommunications laws, Internet electronic mail does not    carry the same privacy protections enjoyed by postal mail    or telephone calls.    The church, which in recent years has been trying to    protect its copyrighted scriptures by trying to block their    dissemination over computer networks, said an unknown    person or persons had used the anon.penet.fi computer to    illegally publish copyrighted church documents on Usenet,    the global electronic bulletin board.    Mr. Helsingius, a 35-year-old computer networking expert,    has not yet revealed the name sought by the Scientologists,    and said he planned to appeal the court ruling. But he said    the court ruling opened the door for future subpoenas    seeking the real names of anon.penet.fi users, and that he    would rather close the system than spend all his time in    court.    Mr. Helsingius has operated anon.penet.fi for more than 3    years, handling over 7,000 messages a day.    "In a sense I've done my pioneer work and it is now up to    others to carry on," Mr. Helsingius said.    Helena Kobrin, a Church of Scientology official, said the    complaint against anon.penet.fi was just one of several    actions the church had taken against the operators of    remailer computers in Europe and the United States. She    said the church has five lawsuits pending in the United    States against remailer operators and users of remailers.    "We have actively been in communication with various    remailers about postings that have gone through their    systems," said Ms. Kobrin, general counsel for the    Religious Technology Center in Los Angeles, which is    responsible for protecting the copyrights and trade secrets    of unpublished Scientology scriptures.    Earlier this year, another remailer, known as hacktic.nl,    in the Netherlands, was shut down under pressure from the    Scientologists.    Unlike many other churches, the Church of Scientology,    founded nearly 40 years ago by the science fiction author    L. Ron Hubbard, regards its gospel as copyrighted material    and a trade secret. Several courts have upheld the validity    of the copyrights.    Foes and critics of the church have used the Internet to    publish the church documents, as well as other documents    the church contends were stolen from its computers.    The Religious Technology Center has also unsuccessfully    attempted to put a stop to the forum on Usenet,     alt.religion.scientology, where many of the copyrighted    documents are published.    A series of recent news articles in The Observer of London    among others had linked the anon.penet.fi computer to    accusations it was a conduit for child pornography.    Mr. Helsingius, who has denied that his system is a conduit    for child pornography, declined to speculate on the motives    of the accusers. The accusations of child pornography first    appeared several days after Mr. Helsingius declined to turn    over to the court the name sought by the Scientologists.    The Observer quoted Toby Tyler, identified as an adviser to    the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as saying    anon.penet.fi was the source for up to 90 percent of the    child pornography on the Internet.    But Richard P. (Toby) Tyler, a sergeant in the San    Bernardino, Calif., County Sheriff's Department who said    his involvement with the F.B.I. was minimal, said he was    misquoted by the newspaper. Mr. Tyler, who has investigated    pornography trafficking in cyberspace, said that most child    pornography on the Internet did not pass through remailers.    He did say, however, that of the small portion that does,    70 percent to 90 percent passes through anon.penet.fi.    "I think that's a shame," Sergeant Tyler said upon learning    that anon.penet.fi was closed. "I personally view its    closing as a loss of freedom. I did not like the abuse of    the remailer for child pornography, but I felt it served a    necessary political purpose in this world."    Ms. Kobrin of the Religious Technology Center said that    despite its legal actions, the Church of Scientology does    not oppose the operation of remailers, which are also known    as anonymous servers.    "We were not opposing the existence of his server," Ms.    Kobrin said. "We have no opposition to there being    anonymity for private, consensual communications. What we    oppose is using anonymous servers for the purpose of    permitting criminal or other unlawful acts. There has to be    responsibility and accountability."    [End]

The Economist, September 7, 1996, p. 79.    Cryptography: Puzzling secrets    The truly paranoid have but one friend: mathematics.    Nothing (and nobody) else can be as trusted to keep a    secret. To transmit your credit card number, for example,    through an Internet full of thieves, the best way is to    hide it in a mathematical problem so excruciatingly    difficult that no thief could ever crack it, even by    hijacking all the world's computers for the effort.    Devising such problems is the business of cryptographers.    To be useful, the problems must be easy to create as well    as impossible to unravel. Multiplying numbers is very    easy. Taking the result and working out what numbers were    multiplied together to produce it (known as    factorisation) is a lot more difficult. It is not obvious    that 4,294,967,297 is the product of 641 and 6,700,417.    The two smaller numbers in this calculation are prime:    that is, neither can be factorised into two further    smaller numbers. The coding systems generally used by    governments, businesses and software companies such as    Netscape (known as RSA encoding schemes, after Ronald    Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who invented the    idea in 1977), mix a number even huger than 4,294,967,297    into a message, and then churn it in such a way that only    the number's prime factors can undo the mess. The big    number is used to make a "public key" (each user has his    own, but it is available to those who might wish to    communicate with him). The two prime factors compose a    private key, guarded carefully by their owner.    The trouble is that nobody is absolutely sure how safe    this scheme is. At present a public key that was 400    digits long would take existing computers longer than the    age of the universe to crack. But it remains to be proved    in a rigorous mathematical way that no systematic    short-cut exists. Indeed, some types of numbers are easy    to factorise, and RSA schemes must avoid these known    softies. It may yet turn out that, even if factorising is    hard in general (as mathematicians suspect, after    centuries of trying), there is a sneaky way, in the case    of some other types of numbers, to do it quickly.    This would be bad luck if you chose such a number.    Private users may not care much: it is unlikely that    someone who discovered such a loophole would use it for    anything so modest as unscrambling credit card numbers.    But governments, whose secrets are worth a lot more, are    always on the lookout for better cloaks to go with their    daggers. The ultimate cryptographic feat would therefore    be a mathematical proof that all choices of a particular    problem useful in code-making are forever intractable.    Nobody is that clever yet. But Miklos Ajtai, a    mathematician at the IBM Almaden Research Centre in San    Jose, California, has made progress with puzzles called    "lattice reductions". If you pick any such problem using    his guidelines, it is -- unlike a factorisation problem    -- guaranteed to be just as thorny as the most difficult    one imaginable. Since many mathematicians also suspect    that the toughest lattice-reduction problem is almost    impossible to crack, Dr Ajtai's proof, completed in May,    increases the confidence that they would all make good    wrappings for secret messages.    For mathematical aesthetes, lattice problems have more    panache than the dull numerals of factorisation. Instead    of factorising, say, a 200-digit number, a lattice    reduction invites the would-be codebreaker to deduce the    most basic way a pattern repeats itself in a piece of    200-dimensional decorative wallpaper. This is every bit    as hard as it sounds.    To describe a repeating pattern of rows and columns of    flowers on an ordinary piece of wallpaper, two "arrows"    suffice. Each points from one flower to a nearby one. If    you start with a wall which is blank, except for one    flower, you can reconstruct the entire design with the    arrows: lay the ends of the arrows on the flower and draw    new flowers (with new arrows) at each arrowtip. Repeat    the process with the new flowers and the wall will    eventually be full.    Although the obvious pair of arrows to choose in this    case would be at right angles to each other (eg, pointing    north and east) other pairs would also work: for example    north-east and east. But in this case the "north-east"    arrow would have to be longer to reach the centre of the    next flower than the "east" one. The puzzle is to find    the shortest set of arrows that can be used to replicate    the pattern -- easy in two or three dimensions, but    achingly complex in the higher-dimensional spaces that    the imaginations of mathematicians inhabit. By the time    the pattern has 200 dimensions, today's fastest computers    would be unable to find the 200 smallest arrows    describing an arbitrary pattern before the sun ran out of    fuel. Yet, as with two prime numbers, it is easy to begin    with those arrows and produce the design.    But how do you hide a secret message, accessible only    with a private key, in a publicly available lattice?    Shafi Goldwasser, Oded Goldreich and Shai Halevi, of the    Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Weizmann    Institute, in Israel, have just proposed a way. In order    to encode a line of digits, they first interpret them as    coordinates for a point in the lattice. Then they mix up    the numbers by nudging that point a tiny random amount    into the empty space between lattice points. To retrieve    the original number, an eavesdropper would need to find    the way back to the nearest lattice point, which is    almost -- but not quite equivalent to knowing its    shortest arrows.    The trouble with it being not quite equivalent is that    the encoding scheme changes the problem slightly --    enough for it to fall just outside the range of Dr    Ajtai's proof that any instance of his lattice scheme is    as hard to solve as the most difficult one.    There is hope that the proof can be extended to include    the encryption scheme, or that the scheme can be modified    to fit the proof. But a proof that nobody could ever    invent a quick method to solve the toughest lattice    reduction would be nicer still -- except that its    inventor would put fellow code-breakers out of work. A    cryptographer who invented such a system might well be    tempted to keep it secret.    [Graphic of wallpaper omitted]    [End]

The Washington Post, September 9, 1996, p. A2.    Computers: Number Crunchers' 1 and Only    It's big. It's beautiful. And it's prime. Computer    scientists at Cray Research have discovered the largest    known prime number. A prime number, for those of us who    have forgotten grade school mathematics, can only be    divided by itself and by 1. Smaller primes include 2, 3, 5,    7 and 11. The new one, 2^1257787-1, is a bit bigger.    Printed out, the 378,632 digit number would take up 12    newspaper pages. "We're pretty confident that this is the    largest known prime number," said researcher Paul Gage.    There are an infinite number of primes but they are    extremely difficult to find. The newly discovered prime    number is of a type known a "Mersenne" prime, named for a    17th century French monk and mathematician. It is easier to    prove the prime-ness of Mersenne numbers than other primes,    thanks to complex mathematical software.    Cray runs the prime-testing program to search for bugs in    its new supercomputers. Gage said the discovery of the    prime was a happy byproduct of the process. The new number    was discovered during a six-hour run testing a new Cray T94    system.    Prime numbers are useful in the field of cryptography,    where they are used to help construct virtually unbreakable    codes. The new prime is far larger than those commonly    used. Said Gage, "A cryptographer interested in numbers    this big wouldn't be talking about it."    -- John Schwartz    [End]

FiTi, 10 September 1996.    Call to abolish banking secrecy    By William Lewis in Cambridge    The UK government should take a lead and abolish banking    secrecy in its dependent territory offshore centres, a    former legal adviser to MI5 and MI6, the British    intelligence agencies, said yesterday.    Mr David Bickford, the first British intelligence lawyer    to speak publicly in the UK, said at a conference in    Cambridge, 50 miles north-east of London, that there    "appears to be no justification at all for offshore bank    secrecy other than to protect the criminal".    He said "offshore bank secrecy can and must be abolished"    and "the UK should be the first to abolish this secrecy    given their control of their dependent territory offshore    centres".    Mr Bickford, who now runs an international legal    consultancy, said "endemic corruption" is caused by    offshore secrecy, and it is "difficult to see why it is    tolerated by any other than those with an unlawful    disposition".    He said allowing countries to maintain offshore banking    secrecy is "a classic example of the corruptive influence    of organised crime".    Mr Bickford added that the "justification is put forward    at all is an example of the overwhelming subversive    corruptive influence of organised crime which has managed    to magic a seemingly acceptable position out of the sheer    weight of its financial proceeds from narcotics, fraud,    extortion and other criminal enterprise".

Because the chip performs the same as DES, Mitsubishi    will promote it as a domestic product for encryption    needs in Japan, with an eye on the growing market for    corporate intranets and high-speed data communications.    It said it will prepare for volume production during this    year.    The company fabricated the chip as a gate array using a    0.5 micron CMOS process and its own proprietary    encryption algorithm MISTY. Operating at a maximum    input/output speed of 40 megahertz, the chip can handle    32 bits per clock cycle.    [End]

Adding to the CWD wiretap alarm by Brock and Declan:    The Washington Post, September 26, 1996, p. A30.    Wiretaps and Money Bills [Editorial]    Legislators who have pet projects but not enough support to    get them passed have a way of turning desperate during the    closing days of the congressional session. Their thoughts    turn ineluctably to unrelated appropriations bills. Only    last week, Rep. Frank Wolf used the transportation funding    bill as a vehicle for usurping the courts' role in a    specific domestic relations dispute. Now senators working    on the Commerce, State and Justice appropriations bill have    slipped in provisions relating to wiretaps that have been    before the Congress for 18 months but have not been    adopted. The law should not be changed by means of these    stealthy riders.    One of the substantive changes in the criminal laws ordered    by the money committee, for example, would make it easier    to obtain court orders authorizing "roving" wiretaps. This    would permit putting taps on any phone a suspect might use    -- including unspecified public phones -- without    requiring, as the law now does, that the government show    that the suspect is attempting to thwart a home or office    tap by repeatedly changing phones. This may or may not be    reasonable, but Congress considered and rejected it earlier    this year. It shouldn't be shoved through on an    appropriations bill.    The committee bill also increased the number of crimes for    which a wiretap can be issued, adding a list of new,    relatively imprecise offenses related to terrorism such as    "providing material support to terrorists" and "terrorist    acts transcending national borders." Taps already are    allowed for just about every major crime in which a    terrorist might engage, including bombing, arson, murder,    kidnapping, extortion, espionage, sabotage, treason,    hostage-taking and the destruction of trains ships,    aircraft and aircraft facilities. What, then, is the reason    for adding these new elastic terms, which could include far    less serious offenses that someone thinks might be linked    to terrorism? The committees that dealt with the subject in    April did not see fit to do so. Why now has the    Appropriations Committee intervened?    The competing values of security and privacy rights require    a much better sorting out. It's best done by people who    have had the benefit of relevant testimony and experience.    The appropriations committees are the wrong setting to deal    with such questions, which should not be presented in a    take-it-or-leave-it package with the government's continued    operation at stake.

The police said Mr. O'Neill       made a threatening gesture at them, but he was later       found to have been unarmed. An intelligence officer       said, "The sleeper is totally committed, aware of all       the surveillance techniques and our ability to penetrate       the organization. He knows when to keep his mouth shut.       He stays as anonymous as possible."    "South African Links Top Spy To the Slaying Of Olof Palme"       The commander of a police hit squad testified today that       the assassination, by a lone gunman who shot Mr. Palme       in the back of the head, had been the work of Operation       Long Reach, a secret apartheid-era program intended to       harass, silence and gather information about opponents       of South Africa's white-led Government abroad. "It was       one of Craig Williamson's Operation Long Reach       projects," he said.       Officially, Mr. Williamson left the police department in       1985, ostensibly to go into business with an Italian       millionaire operating from the Seychelles. In reality,       he then started Long Reach, a company that did some       legitimate international security work, but which was       largely created to give him the cover to do whatever he       pleased around the world.    -----        HBO_ped

He has not been arrested but his equipment has been

other machinery.
He says he's surprised that it has taken so long for Sam

On Phil Hallam-Baker's rejoinder to Paul Bradley' defense of AP:
Virtually all of Phil's charges against AP apply equally well to
state-sponsored killing in the natonal interest, including that
arranged by highly educated, cultured, philosophical, nuclear physicists and electrical engineers.
That's the issue. Who gets to decide who lives and who dies, and
how close the killer is to the slaughter, unprotected by law, by
public consensus, by popular will, by apologetics for the security
of national interest.
Jim Bell is hardly the first to articulate this challenge to the grand
tradition of the majestic state and its precursors -- the king, the bandit, the tribal bully, the strong -- all sanctioned beasts taking what their trainers want by force, while being excused and celebrated by fey intellectuals and balladeers of all craven submissive dress.

He seems bemused that his script was followed so dutifully for Act 1. And awaits the next acts, instigated not only by his taunts but by

@_subject: Prior Restraint 
As noted here on April 2, we've put on our Web site several of
the docs of the Peter Junger suit against the Secretary of State:
   One gives parts of Peter's article "Computers and the Law" which includes machine-readable code, code which is prohibited by the EAR from being placed on the Internet without a license (it is this "prior restraint" that Peter is challenging):
   When Peter saw that I had put the article and code on my site,
he telephoned immediately to say that the article should not have been sent to me along with the other material. He asked that it be removed because electronic publication could harm his case and
put me at risk of prosecution.
After discussion I declined to remove it, and thanked him for his Yesterday, Richard Vasvari, one of Peter's three attorneys, called
to politely ask that I remove the doc. And further explained how its electronic publication could harm the case and put me at risk. He said that he had notified Anthony Coppolino, DoJ, that the document was on the Web, as he was obliged to do by procedural rules. That they had discussed the ramifications. He did not say what DoJ intended
to do.
And, that he was obliged as an attorney to advise me to retain an attorney
for my defense against prosecution for placing the doc on the Web.
During this discussion with Mr. Vasvari I checked the access log for the prohibited doc and saw that DoJ had accessed it as well as several other files on me and my org.
I told Mr. Vasvari this and he again advised me to remove the doc. Again,
I declined.
After chewing on this restraint of my publication by the attorneys, I decided to delete only the machine-readable code from Peter's article, leaving the  text which explains why the electronic publication of the code is the crux of Peter's First Amendment case. On the assumption that his prior restraint claim is more important than mine.
Take at look and let me know what you think. Should I have deleted the
code or left it in the public domain where it belongs? Am I right to comply
with the attorneys' first claim on prior restraint?
Meanwhile, anyone worldwide who want the article with the code intact, send me an email for instructions on how to get it.

@_subject: Surveillance 
Chief Judge Royce Lamberth of the US Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court spoke yesterday at the ABA's National
Security Law gathering. (On C-SPAN).
Points of interest:
Why the court is not involved in domestic surveillance with
the rise of terrorism and militancy in the US: It was considered during the implementation of the recent Anti-Terrorism Act but a decision was made to leave that task to District Courts.
Why the court has denied only a dozen out of 8,000 requests
for surveillance: All are excellently prepared and the judges advise on the few applications that are not to make them He went on to say that numbers do not tell the real story, that
there are a variety of ways orders are issued and continued to
keep an investigation viable and as it evolves. He cited the differences in renewals between orders covering individuals and those covering organizations: the first must be renewed every 90 days, the latter every year.
Moreover, there may be changes during an investigation, say,
by targeting an individual within an org, with difference regs, or
combining individuals into a group, with also different regs. So
the numbers of orders do not actually reflect how things work.
However, the Court makes and annual report to Congress.
Judge Lamberth joked that he hoped the Court's decisions
were "constitutional," and after the laughter, apologized and
said he should not have said that.
He said that positions on the court are avidly sought, that the
work was the most "fun" he had ever had, that it was very
exciting to be part of the select group that deals with the highest
secrets of the land.
He commented on how "Article 3" provisions to protect national
security and related secrets conflict with the FOIA, by saying
first things first.
A related note on Greg's fruitless FOIA requests to various agencies about cpunks: active investigations are protected from FOIA requests, indeed, it is not uncommon to keep an investigation "active" to keep the secrets, to redefine the targets, to redefine as
the Courts helpfully advise.
Be sure to laugh at the constitutional joke, it's fun to be an insider playing with vital national life and death decisions and amusing the audience on TV.

openness to all interested participants. Guy Copeland, a representative from the Task Force, briefly discussed the ISSB model and the purposes of the meeting. Will Ozier, Chairman of the GSSP Committee, next discussed the efforts of the Generally Accepted System Security Principles (GSSP) project. Several representatives from the Administration expressed support for the concept of the ISSB. These representatives also indicated that the Administration would like private industry to take the lead in this area and is more than willing to take "a back seat" to such an effort.

Excerpts of remarks by NSA head William Crowell to
NISSC96, October, 1996:
Key recovery may prove essential in making encryption scalable on an international basis. We are not the only country wrestling with the public safety implications of unbreakable cryptography. France, Israel and Russia recently imposed import and domestic use restrictions. Several Asian, South American and African countries have had similar restrictions in place for years. Others
may impose them as strong cryptography proliferates.
For many overseas, as well as here, the logic of the need to balance business imperatives with public safety concerns argues for key recovery. The European Union and other confederations are considering key recovery-based KMIs. The world's major standards bodies are designing future standards so that key recovery can be accommodated.
International standards and protocols for key recovery may prove essential to hand off national restrictions on strong encryption, to promote a broad export market for cryptography and to establish a key management infrastructure acceptable for general international use. This would accelerate the realization of the promise of information technology, and that would be in everyone's best interest.
Working in partnership, government and industry together need to lay the foundation necessary to sustain and strengthen information security for America. I wish to emphasize that the infrastructure for key management will be built by industry as a commercial venture. This task is huge. Collaboration among many partners will be essential if we are to establish a KMI that promotes the use of encryption worldwide.

@_subject: Competitive Betrayal 
Weekend FiTi reports on "the enemy within" corporations
and the growth of "competitive intelligence" as cold war spy tactics are adapted to big business. Excerpts:
Nobody in the surveillance business really knows how much commercial spying goes on. A lot of the eavesdropping is done, perfectly legally, by managers listening in to their own staff.
It is, of course, in the interest of equipment suppliers and
corporate consultants to maximise the dangers that companies
face. "All companies are paranoid about their own security,"
said the spokesman of one well-known British multinational.
"They don't seem to mind paying consultants to tell them
things they know already."
Yet all agree that the field of "competitive intelligence",
as it is politely termed, is an expanding one. The
privatisation of whole economies, the deregulation of
monopoly markets, the globalisation of business, the spread
of foreign investment and contested takeovers, the
proliferation of technology and the sheer volume of
information - all have made companies more aggressive, and
more vulnerable.
A consultant called in to investigate a theft may find
himself pitted against another. In order to sanitise the
business, a professional association called the Society of
Competitive Intelligence Professionals has been set up.
Its 5,000 members are meant to follow a code which vaguely
urges them to obey the law, identify themselves when asking
questions, and avoid "unethical practices".
SCIP is influenced by the Association of Former Intelligence
Officers, a group described as "very powerful" by Andre
Pienaar, a young manager at the corporate investigators
Kroll Associates who has written a doctoral thesis on
business and intelligence.
"Company information has become very valuable," he said,
"more valuable than physical assets."
Protecting that information is becoming ever more difficult.
It is not just the tappers, buggers and hackers who are the
problem, however. The problem is the loyalty - or lack of it
- of employees in a world of short contracts, rapid turnover
and big inducements.
Tony McStravick, former acting head of the Metropolitan
police Fraud Squad in London, has worked for Kroll and is
now at Control Risks Group. "It all comes down to management
in the end," he said. "Companies have lost the hearts and
minds of their employees because of performance pay,
delayering, downsizing."
"You have to have a culture of honesty, from the top down.
You must find the balance between maximising profits and
being fair and honest. A lot of the time, companies forget
they are dealing with human beings."

January, 1997
Appendix D
Special Procedures for Use in Systematic and Mandatory
Review of Cryptologic Information
1. General guideline: Cryptologic information uncovered in
systematic or mandatory review for declassification of 25-
year old government records is not to be declassified by
other than the National Security Agency. The information may
concern or reveal the processes, techniques, operations, and
scope of signals intelligence (SIGINT), which consists of
communications intelligence (COMINT), electronic
intelligence (ELINT), and foreign instrumentation signals
intelligence (FISINT), or it may concern the components of
Information Security (INFOSEC) which consists of
communications security (COMSEC) and computer security
(COMPUSEC), including the communications portion of cover
and deception plans. Much cryptologic information is also
considered "Foreign Government Information" as defined in
Para. 1.1(d) of the Executive Order 12958.
2. Recognition of cryptologic information may not always be
an easy task. There are several broad classes of cryptologic
information, as follows:
  a. Those that relate to INFOSEC: In documentary form,
they provide   COMSEC/COMPUSEC guidance or information. Many
COMSEC/COMPUSEC documents and materials are accountable
under the Communications Security Material Control System.
Examples are items bearing telecommunications security
(TSEC) nomenclature and crypto keying material for use in
enciphering communications and other COMSEC/COMPUSEC
documentation such as the National Telecommunications and
Information Systems Security Committee or is predecessor
organization, COMSEC/COMPUSEC Resources Program documents,
COMSEC Equipment Engineering Bulletins, COMSEC Equipment
System Descriptions, and COMSEC Technical Bulletins.
  b. Those that relate to SIGINT: These appear as
reports in various formats that bear security
classifications, frequently followed by five-letter
codewords, for example, World War II's ULTRA, and often
carry warning caveats such as "This document contains
codeword material" and "Utmost secrecy is necessary..." or
"Handle Via COMINT Channels Only" or "HVCCO" or "CCO."
Formats may appear as messages having addresses, "from" and
"to" sections, and as summaries with SIGINT content with or
without other kinds of intelligence and comment.
  c. Research, development, test, life cycle support,
planning, and evaluation reports and information that
relates to either COMSEC, COMPUSEC, or SIGINT.
3. Some commonly used words that help to identify
cryptologic documents and materials are "cipher," "code,"
"codeword," communications intelligence," or "COMINT,"
"special intelligence," "communications security," or
"COMSEC," "computer security or COMPUSEC," cryptanalysis,"
"crypto," cryptography," "cryptosystem," "cipher,"
"decipher," "decode," "decrypt," "direction finding,"
"electronic intelligence" or "ELINT," "electronic security,"
"encipher," "encode," "encrypt," "foreign instrumentation
signals intelligence" or "FISINT" pr "FIS"," "telemetry,"
"information systems security" or "INFOSEC," "intercept,"
"key book," "one-time-pad," "bookbreaking," "signals
intelligence" or "SIGINT," "signals security," "TEMPEST,"
and "traffic analysis" or "TA."
4. Special procedures apply to the review and
declassification of classified cryptologic information. The
following shall be observed in the review of such
  a. INFOSEC (COMSEC and COMPUSEC) Documents and
  (1) If records or materials in this category are
found in agency or department component files that are not
under INFOSEC control, refer them to the senior
COMSEC/COMPUSEC authority of the agency or department
concerned or return them, by appropriate channels, to the
address in item 4.c, below.
  (2) If the COMSEC/COMPUSEC information has been
incorporated into other documents by the receiving agency,
that information must be referred to the National Security
Agency/Chief Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) for review
before declassification occurs.
  b. SIGINT (COMINT, ELINT, and FISINT) Information.
  (1) If the SIGINT information is contained in a
document or record originated by a U.S. Government
cryptologic organization and is in the files of a non-
cryptologic agency or department, such material will not be
declassified. The material may be destroyed unless the
holding agency's approved records disposition schedule
requires its retention. If the material must be retained, it
must be referred to the NSA/CSS for systematic review for
declassification when it becomes 25-years old or older.
  (2) If the SIGINT information has been
incorporated by the receiving agency into documents it
produces, referral of the SIGINT information to the NSA/CSS
for review is necessary prior to any declassification
  c. COMSEC/COMPUSEC or SIGINT information which
requires declassification by the NSA/CSS should be sent to:
  Director, National Security Agency/
  Chief, Central Security Service
  ATTN: Information Policy Staff (N5P6)
  Fort George G. Meade, MD 20755-6000

international fora, the Internet and intelligence. As a
result, the US technology leadership in communications and
computer systems has declined in recent years relative to

21 April 1997:
     US Govt Licenses First European Encryption Firm
     London: The US Department of Commerce has awarded the
     euro-encryption rights to Internet Smartware, a UK company.
     According to Internet Smartware, the agreement overcomes
     two major stumbling blocks which have prevented businesses
     from using the Internet for commercial use:      Firstly, European companies can now implement US
     developed 56-bit DES (data encryption standard) encryption
     technology, which the company claims is the accepted
     minimum requirement for Internet commerce, and beyond.      Secondly, companies will no longer have to give authorities
     such as the US government free access to their encrypted
     data.      Internet Smartware claims that the agreement also provides
     UK companies with an effective alternative to the recent,
     unpopular DTI (Department of Trade and Industry)
     encryption proposals, which recommend that companies
     must give "trusted third parties" access to encrypted data.      "Smart" Cash Cards Pose Law Enforcement Challenges      Washington: "Smart cards" that store electronic currency      have the potential to revolutionize commerce, but the emerging      technology poses challenges for the law enforcement community,      government officials said Friday.      "The same electronic commerce technology that will save
     time and money is also capable of being abused," said Peter
     Toren, senior attorney in the U.S. Justice Department's
     computer fraud division. Toren, speaking at a conference at      American University's law school here, warned that the cards      offer the "threat of the perfect counterfeit" because any criminal      that can copy them "can create an unending stream of money."      IISP Panel Addresses Cyberspace Payments
     New York -- Developing secure, cost effective and efficient      electronic payment systems is critical to creating a truly      global commercial marketplace, and efforts are already underway      to address the technology, business, regulatory and legal      aspects of cyberspace payments, according to speakers at a      March 25-26 panel sponsored by ANSI's Information      Infrastructure Standards Panel (IISP).      "Micro-payments, anonymous cash, `Smart Cards,' digital
     cash, electronic purses, and `e-cash' all describe different
     approaches to achieving a secure payments solution," said
     ANSI board Member Oliver Smoot. "As these new payments      evolve, standards to facilitate interconnection and interoperability      are critical."      Thomas J. Firnhaber, Policy Adviser at FinCEN, focused on      the potential impact of cyberpayments on regulatory and law      enforcement and provided an overview of the U.S. Department      of Treasury's Cyberpayments efforts to date. "The anonymity,      rapidity, volume and audit difficulty of cyberpayments has      challenged traditional investigative techniques," he said.
     Smart Cards The Next Wave - Report      London: Frost & Sullivan (F&S) has announced the      publication of a smart card report that predicts the arrival      of multi-function smart cards is almost upon us.      "Electronic Access Control" predicts that it will soon be possible      for a smart card to carry out credit and debit card transactions, as      well as holding details of your medical records, your frequent flyer
     mileage, your social security number, your address.      According to F&S, a threat to this technological advance may
     be the consumer concern for the loss of privacy and a
     potential Big Brother scenario. Who, the company asks, gets
     to access the information is an issue on the minds of the
     consumer?

22 April 1997:
     Space/intelligence technology's embattled frontier      European citizens and governments alike have expressed
     concern over the recent expansion of U.S. intelligence bases
     in Europe. The National Security Agency (NSA) and National
     Reconnaissance Office (NRO) are combining efforts at large
     sites known as regional SIGINT (signals intelligence)
     operation centers, or RSOCs.      At a recent Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
     NRO director Keith Hall said that the merging of the NSA and
     NRO bases is the first step in creating "collaborative systems
     of systems in signals intelligence." In the future, Hall said,
     those joint efforts could also include the U.S. Space
     Command, the service intelligence agencies and even
     commercial resources "borrowed" by the intelligence
     community.      U.S. military officials have been surprisingly candid about
     their intent to take maximum strategic advantage of their
     information trump cards. Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall      said, "Our allies must understand that we bring tremendous      capabilities to the table, and it would be to their advantage to      find ways we both can use [them]."      In a more blatant revelation of U.S. sentiment, Gen. Howell
     Estes, commander of the U.S. Space Command, said the
     United States "is the only nation intellectually prepared for and
     morally capable" of controlling space-based intelligence.      President, Senators Set to clash on Encryption
     Bent on retaining access to any and all data exported from the

     position on Internet security issues and have a bill sponsored
     in the Senate.      Meanwhile, microprocessing giant Intel Corp. of Santa Clara,
     Calif., which has been developing hardware-based encryption
     tools based on Cupertino, Calif.-based Hewlett-Packard's
     International Cryptography Framework, is sitting tight,
     waiting to see how things play out on Capitol Hill.      Intel already has submitted the framework for government
     review, but is closely guarding specifics about its encryption
     key lengths.      SET 2.0 on the way - Encryption spec speeds e-commerce      "SET 2.0 will be security-algorithm-independent," said Steve
     Mott, senior vice president for electronic commerce at
     MasterCard International. "The issue is not the underlying
     cryptography, and the problem is not with RSA's
     mathematics; it's how efficient [RSA's cryptography] is."      Vendors such as Certicom, Apple Computer, and RPK are all
     positioning themselves as alternatives to market-leader RSA
     for providing encryption technologies.      "We have SET 1.0 pilots going with elliptic curve
     cryptography," Mott said.      Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC) is a technology that is
     being pushed by both Certicom and Apple.
     RPK, meanwhile, offers another alternative to encryption: Its
     Mixture Generator encryption engine performs both bulk and
     key encryption.
     A Smart Partnership      Pretty Good Privacy Inc. and Schlumberger Electronic      Transactions are teaming up to integrate their encryption      and smart-card technologies. The two companies will interweave      PGP's encryption software with Schlumberger's Cryptoflex smart
     card, which supports functions such as key and digital
     certificate storage and signatures.
     U.S. Seeks Laissez Faire on Internet      The Clinton administration plans to tell the Internal Revenue
     Service and bank regulators to forget about new rules for
     Internet commerce in a policy paper that is scheduled to be
     released later this spring, Ira Magaziner said last week.      It is unclear how far this laissez faire approach will go.
     Speaking at the same session, a top official in the Office of
     the U.S. Trade Representative warned about the obstacles he
     sees in trying to get other governments to go along.      He warned. "What do governments want to do? They want to
     regulate," he added. "It's ingrained to the system. It's almost a
     social-democratic ideal they want to fulfill."      MITI to develop int'l electronic commerce technology      The ministry will formulate a standard for authentication
     centers that use different data-verification methods. The new
     protocol would facilitate the exchange of encryption data
     among authentication centers around the world, thus allowing
     a business to verify the identity of a client in another country.
     MITI, which has earmarked over 10 billion yen (about 79.82
     million dollars) for electronic commerce tests, is hoping to
     nurture Japan's own electronic commerce services and to
     narrow the technological gap with the U.S.

Prof. Dorothy E. Denning
This course will study the nature of information warfare, including computer crime and information terrorism, in the global information infrastructure as it relates to national security, defense policy, economic security, organizational security, and personal security. Students will gain an understanding of the threats and vulnerabilities, including military and economic espionage, denial of service, destruction and modification of data, distortion and fabrication of information, forgery, control and disruption of information flow, electronic bombs, and psyops and perception management. They will learn about attacks and countermeasures, including authentication, encryption, auditing, monitoring, and firewalls, and the limitations of those countermeasures. They will learn about cyberspace law enforcement and investigations, information warfare and the military, and intelligence in the information age. Information technology policy and ethics will be examined.

   EU fraudsters 'revel in fiscal paradise'
      Report urges Brussels authorities to crack down on $77bn
      cross-border corruption
   By John Mason in Brussels
   International fraud in the European Union could be costing
   governments, companies and individuals up to $77bn a year,
   a report commissioned by the European Commission has
   concluded.
   Crimes such as Internet abuse, counterfeiting, banking and
   investment frauds and smuggling pose an increasing threat
   which can only be countered by further international
   action, said Deloitte & Touche, the accountancy firm.
   Harmonisation of laws and regulations, improved
   co-operation between states and a greater stress on fraud
   prevention are needed if EU economies are not to be
   undermined by international criminals, the report said.
   Mr Will Inglis, the Deliotte & Touche partner responsible
   for the report, said: "There is clear evidence that
   determined fraudsters deliberately and cynical]y manipulate
   and take advantage of the different regulatory and
   monitoring regimes across the EU to perpetrate their
   frauds. In particular, we see the fraudsters taking
   advantage of havens of secrecy and fiscal paradises.
   Fraudulent activity in the Union has the potential to
   seriously distort competition and harm the citizens of the
   EU who end up paying the cost."
   The report identified 10 areas of concern: computer abuse,
   banking frauds, counterfeiting, investment fraud,
   confidence tricks, public sector fraud, fraudulent
   bankruptcy, insurance fraud, smuggling and money
   laundering.
   The type of crime varies considerably between countries. In
   the UK, financial services fraud is a problem because of
   the size of the industry, France suffers particularly from
   counterfeiting of luxury goods, while in Greece the
   smuggling of antiquities is second only to the drugs trade
   in terms of crime.
   However, across the EU, the removal of restrictions
   following the creation of the single market and
   technological advances have opened up opportunities for
   fraudsters, the report said.
   Perhaps the largest single threat comes from fraud through
   the Internet, Mr Inglis said. The potential for abuse of
   computer systems is huge, particularly since encryption
   technology is vulnerable to sophisticated computer abusers.
   The Internet is now also being used to manipulate financial
   markets.
   In other areas, fraudsters are becoming more sophisticated.
   Insider dealers are making more use of offshore havens to
   avoid detection while criminal syndicates with knowledge of
   banking practice have cheated banks.
   Not that frauds all need to be sophisticated. Italian
   investigators discovered that Libyan dinars were being
   taken to Naples to be literally "laundered" with a solvent
   and re-printed as D-Marks.
   The incidence of cross-border frauds is increasing faster
   than those which take place only within one country, with
   organised crime playing a substantial role, the report
   said. Other perpetrators of fraud, although on a lesser
   scale, include senior company managers.
   The report points to lack of legal harmonisation: In some
   EU states it is not even an offence to bribe somebody in a
   different country.
   Action against fraud can also damage a member state's
   economy. The use of "offshore" havens, some inside the EU,
   remains a common feature of fraud. But with some EU
   economies closely linked to the offshore world, the
   incentive to push for reform in this area is limited.
   Fraud, especially crossborder fraud, tends also to be given
   low priority compared to other crimes. There is also less
   political will to tackle money laundering when this
   involves fraud rather than drugs.
   The report concludes there are four priority areas -    increased legal harmonisation, improved co-operation
   between member states, a greater concentration on
   confiscating fraudsters' assets and developing awareness of
   fraud prevention.

@_subject: New USG Privacy Initiative 
The Administration has issued today for public comment a major new paper on privacy:
"Options for Promoting Privacy on the National Information Opening paragraphs:
This Options Paper explores the growing public concern about personal information privacy. The paper describes the status of electronic data protection and fair information practices in the United States today, beginning with a discussion of the Principles for providing and using personal information issued by the Information Infrastructure Task Force in 1995. It then provides an overview of new information technologies, which shows that personal information is currently collected, shared, aggregated, and disseminated at a rate and to a degree unthinkable just a few years ago. Government is no longer the sole possessor of extensive amounts of personal information about U.S. citizens; in recent years the acquisition of personal information by the private sector has increased dramatically.
We next consider in more detail the laws and policies affecting information privacy in four specific areas: government records, communications, medical records, and the consumer market. This examination reveals that information privacy policy in the United States consists of various laws, regulations and practices, woven together to produce privacy protection that varies from sector to sector. Sometimes the results make sense, and sometimes they do not. The degree of protection accorded to personal information may depend on the data delivery mechanism rather than on the type of information at issue. Moreover, information privacy protection efforts in the United States are generally reactive rather than proactive: both the public and the private sector adopt policies in response to celebrated incidents of nonconsensual disclosure involving readily discernable harm. Sometimes this approach leaves holes in the fabric of privacy protection.  We then turn to the core question: in the context of the GII, what is the best mechanism to implement fair information practices that balance the needs of government, commerce, and individuals, keeping in mind both our interest in the free flow of information and in the protection of information privacy? At one end of the spectrum there is support for an entirely market-based response. At the other end of the spectrum, we are encouraged to regulate fair information practices across all sectors of the economy. In between these poles lie a myriad of options. In response to public concern, both government and private industry seem to be taking a harder look at privacy issues. As government and consumers become more aware of the GII's data collection, analysis and distribution capabilities, demand could foster a robust, competitive market for privacy protection. This raises the intriguing possibility that privacy could emerge as a market commodity in the Information Age. We recognize ongoing efforts to enhance industry self regulation to carry out the IITF Privacy Principles. We also discuss ways this self regulation might be enforced, and discuss a number of ways that government could facilitate development of a privacy market. We then consider a number of options that involve creation of a federal privacy entity. We discuss some of the many forms that such an entity could take and consider the advantages and disadvantages of the various choices. We also consider the functions that such an entity might perform, as well as various options for locating a privacy entity within the federal government.  This paper presents a host of options for government and private sector action. Our ultimate goal is to identify the means to maintain an optimal balance between personal privacy and freedom of information in the digital environment. The next step is to receive and respond to public comment on the report in order to develop consensus regarding the appropriate allocation of public and private sector responsibility for implementation of fair information practices.

While it might be too touchy for Netscaper cryptographers to address
openly, I wonder if there is not a scheme afoot to go along with the current restrictions in order to be better positioned to compete with others intending to launch robust encryption as soon as the leak in the dam globally breaks.
There may be more to this story than appears in the PR of
industry and government. The crypto fight may be a diversion.
Suppose the governments intend to relax crypto restrictions once other technologies to monitor electronic transactions are
in place and and enforcers have been trained to snare illegal transactors based on physical evidence of crime beyond the
digital. Recall that that's what Peter Neumann and others on the NRC crypto panel suggested as an agenda for the FBI to forego undue
crypto emphasis.
Is it not possible that the US and other nations will allow strong
encryption so long as other means are at hand to control any
action merely cloaked in encrypted language, as has been done
forever with stylistic literature and speech?
To, as with its predecessors, tolerate the artist of cryptoanarchy but guillotine the actor.

     Report/ Encryption policy hurts trade      U.S. controls on the export of encryption technology and
     telecommunications equipment represent significant barriers
     to international trade, the European Commission said in a
     report last week.      The development of digital communications has prompted the
     need for improved protection against the unauthorized use of
     personal data, trade secrets, banking information and
     databases. Without that protection, it is unlikely that
     electronic commerce will take off, said one European
     Commission official.      The commission's 13th annual ``Report on United States
     Barriers to Trade and Investment'' said the U.S. is the
     dominant supplier of key computing components, and the
     country's limitations on the export of strong encryption

  Using something called "Shor's algorithm," a quantum

  *explain how Shor's algorithms works.*"

L0pht summarized their current campaign to test

that corporations refuse to publicize or correct
holes L0pht reported in confidence.
L0pht cited, among others, the Mac security features and products coming to market, which they think have been too hastily readied for grafting onto other programs and and are vulnerable due to inadequate design, integration and testing. Like too many MS flood-the-market programs.
Bruce outlined the principal elements of the security
challenge and the role of cryptography among those
of people, hardware, facilities, law and policy. He
warned of the weakness of relying on crypto in the overall security matrix and cautioned that crypto is not the main answer to the security problem, which is primarily one of human frailty and criminal behavior, and that it will take a combination of solutions involving:   Strong and efficient encryption -- key length is   not critical
  Tamper resistant hardware -- software can be protected   by math
  Trust management -- reliable authentication and   certification; GAK is too complicated to ever work
  Jurisdiction -- criminals must not be able to operate   from the most obliging state
  Law -- punishment for criminal acts
He emphasized that mathematics and software are not the problem of insecure systems, it is humans and the impossibility
of predictable interface with machines. Every system is vulnerable
to attack, not at its strongest but at its weakest. Brute force
is not an attack worth worrying about, although it gets most
of the publicity. What's worrisome is the out of the way fault
in the fortress, the one nobody expects, the one the enemy
ever seeks by hook, crook, bribe and trick. (HOPE's agenda?)
It was a provocative, informative, many-faceted presentation,
and could become an article, maybe a book, surely an
effective business lure.

Most surprising about HOPE was that everyone, M/F, was dressed in brass-button blazers, oxford whites, rep ties and gray flannels;
spit-shined caps, Shasti barbered, smelled of Camay; murmured "well said" to the eloquent speakers, softly sniffed for salient points, chatted at tea, "swell show, don't you think."
None of the ripe rank of cavities and pits,dreadlocks and skulls, vulgar tees and shreds, toilet squalor and slime,  chest-caving music, vile hoots and whistles of "phreak Ma B, crack Mr. Softie," crazed eyeballs assaulting gameboxes, deformed bods struggling to get in against those escaping Bedlam, none of that at Beyond Hope, not at all, that was outside in the gutters of Manhattan, defiling a tux and gown wedding party upstairs at Puck.

System name: Electronic Surveillance (Elsur) Indices.
System location:   Federal Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover Bldg., 10th and   Pennvylvania Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20535. Those field offices which   have sought conducted electronic surveillances also maintain an index.   See appendix to System 022.
Categories of individuals covered by the system:   Individuals who have been the targets of direct electronic   surveillance coverage by FBI in a court order; those whose   communications have been monitored/intercepted by an FBI electronic   surveillance installation; those who won, lease, or license premises   subjected to electronic surveillance coverage sought by the FBI in a   court order.
Categories of records in the system:   The ELSUR Index is comprised of three types of 3 x 5 cards: 1.   Principal cards identify, by true name or best known name, all   interceptees (targets) identified in an application filed by the FBI   in support of an affidavit seeking a court order to conduct an   electronic surveillance; 2. Proprietary Interest cards identify   entities and/or individuals who own, lease, license or otherwise hold   a possessory interest in locations subjected to an electronic   surveillance sought by the FBI in a court order; and, 3. Overhear   cards identify, by true name or best known name, individuals and/or   entities who have been reasonably identified by a first name or   initial and a last name a being a party to a communication monitored/
  intercepted by the FBI.
Authority for maintenance of the system:   The ELSUR Index was initiated in October, 1966, at the recommendation   of the Department of Justice and relates to electronic surveillances   conducted/ sought by the FBI since 1/1/60. The authority for the   maintenance of these records is Title 5, Section 301, USC, which   grants the Attorney General the authority to issue rules and   regulations prescribing how Department of Justice information can be   employed. Title 18, U.S.C., Section 3504, also sets forth   recordkeeeping requirements.
Routine uses of records maintained in the system, including categories     of users and the purposes of such uses:   The Elsur Indices are utilized: (1) To respond to judicial inquiries   about possible electronic surveillance coverage of witnesses,   defendants, or attorneys involved in Federal court proceedings, and   (2) To enable the Government to certify whether a person regarding   whom court-order authority is being sought for electronic coverage has   ever been so covered in the past. The actual users of the indices are   always employees of the FBI.
  In addition, information may be released to the news media and the   public pursuant to 28 CFR 50.2 unless it is determined that release of   the specific information in the context of a particular case would   constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

Berkley Publishing Group is paying an advance of approximately $22 million according to these people. The series, set in the near future, will include six adult and 18 juvenile novels.

R.I. Passes Body Fluid Felony Law
PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Inmates on the East Coast refer to it as
``serving'' a prison guard, while in the West it's called ``gassing.'' Guards know it simply as being splashed or smeared with urine or feces. ``It's a badge of honor to serve an officer,'' said Richard Loud, president
of the Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers. ``When an officer
gets served, the other inmates all cheer. They think it's a big joke.'' Rhode Island is among the states that have adopted laws to crack down on the
activity. A bill signed July 1 by Gov. Lincoln Almond makes throwing bodily
fluids or wastes a felony punishable by up to five more years behind bars
and a $5,000 fine. New York adopted a similar law last year, although, unlike the one in Rhode
Island, it didn't include saliva. ``I think Rhode Island probably has one of the best laws in the country,''
said Stephen Chand, director of federal affairs for the Law Enforcement
Alliance of America. Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., has sponsored federal legislation requiring
that inmates be tested for the AIDS virus if their bodily fluid or waste
touches a guard. Two such assaults occur a month at Rhode Island's state prison, Loud said
Tuesday. Some believe the punishment is excessive. ``We think it is a harsh reaction to a non-issue,'' said Steve Brown,
executive director of the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union. ``I think in most cases this will involve spitting. Inmates shouldn't
be spitting on guards, but certainly it doesn't merit a five-year prison
sentence.'' The act has been taking place for years in prisons, but such bills are
gaining strength because of the fear of AIDS. ``The scientific and medical evidence is abundantly clear that it is
virtually impossible to get infected with the HIV virus through that sort of
conduct,'' Brown said. Prisons already can punish inmates by placing them in solitary confinement
or revoking other privileges, or can try them for misdemeanor assault, Brown
said. But authorities have had trouble prosecuting inmates under the
misdemeanor assault law, said Rep. Joseph McNamara, D-Warwick, the bill's
sponsor. ``It's difficult to prove intent to do harm,'' McNamara said. However, he said, the fact that different slang terms exist for the act in
various parts of the country show how much a part of prison culture it is.

We've received from anonymous a July 25 draft of an Encryption
Items Interim Rule for the Export Administration Regulations
which describes Commerce Control List changes in response to public comments on the December 30, 1996 interim rule.
     (82K)
The draft is in Federal Register format but, as far as we have been
able to find, has not been published there. So if this doc was published
we'd like to hear.
Assuming the draft is legitimate, here's its summary of provisions (much
expanded in the full document):
[Begin summary]
Based on public comments to the December 30 interim rule, this interim rule
specifically makes the following changes:
- In �732.2, clarifies that BXA will consider acknowledgments and
assurances in electronic form provided that they are adequate to assure
legal undertakings similar to written acknowledgments and assurances.
- In �734.3, clarifies that downloading or causing the downloading of
encryption source code and object code in Canada is not controlled and does
not require a license, and clarifies that the methods used as precautions
to prevent unauthorized transfer of such code outside the United States or
Canada must be approved by BXA.
- In �740.6, clarifies that letters of assurance may be accepted in the
form of a letter or any other written communication from the importer,
including communications via facsimile.
- In �740.8, adds recovery encryption technology to the list of items
eligible for export under License Exception KMI, after a one-time review,
and adds a paragraph to authorize exporters of non-key recovery products
under License Exception KMI to service and support existing customers of
those products after the two-year transition period.  This section is also
amended by adding a paragraph to authorize exporters of non-recovery
encryption products under License Exception KMI to export additional
quantities of such products to existing customers under a license after the
two-year transition period.
- �740.8 is also amended by adding a new paragraph to authorize, after a
one-time review, exports and reexports under License Exception KMI of
non-key recovery financial-specific encryption items of any key length that
are restricted by design (e.g., highly field-formatted with validation
procedures, and not easily diverted to other end-uses)  for financial
applications to secure financial transactions, for end-uses such as intra
or inter-banking transfers and home banking.  No business and marketing
plan to develop, produce, and/or market similar encryption items with
recoverable features is required. Conforming changes are also made in
- In �740.9, removes the reference to Country Group D:1.  This clarifies
that encryption software controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 may be
pre-loaded on a laptop and exported under the tools of trade provisions of
License Exception TMP or License Exception BAG.
- In �740.14, clarifies existing provisions of License Exception BAG and
imposes a restriction on the use of BAG for exports or reexports of
EI-controlled items to terrorist supporting destinations or by other than
U.S. citizens and permanent residents.
-  �742.15 is amended adding a new paragraph that authorizes exports under
an Encryption Licensing Arrangement of general purpose non-key recovery,
non-voice encryption items of any key length for use by financial
institutions (such as banks) in all destinations except Cuba, Iran, Iraq,
Libya, North Korea, Syria and Sudan.  Applications will be reviewed on a
case-by-case basis, and must be supported by a satisfactory business and
marketing plan which explains in detail the steps the applicant will take
during the two year transition period beginning January 1, 1997 to develop,
produce, and/or market similar encryption items with recoverable features.
- In Supplement No. 4 to part 742, paragraph (3), revises "reasonable
frequency" to "at least once every three hours" to resolve the ambiguity on
how often the output must identify the key recovery agent and
material/information required to decrypt the ciphertext.
- In Supplement No. 4 to part 742, paragraph (6)(i), clarifies that the
U.S. government must be able to obtain the key(s) or other
material/information needed to decrypt all data, without restricting the
means by which the key recovery products allow this.
- In Supplement No. 6 to part 742, eliminates the test vector requirement
for 7-day mass-market classification requests and replaces it with a
requirement to provide a copy of the encryption subsystem source code.
-  In Supplement No. 6 to part 742, adds 40-bit DES as being eligible for
consideration for mass-market eligibility, subject to the additional
criteria listed in this supplement.
- In �� 748.9 and 748.10, clarifies a long-standing policy that no support
documentation is required for exports of technology or software, and it
removes the requirement for such support documentation for exports of
technology or software to Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland,
Romania, or Slovakia.  This rule also exempts from support documentation
requirements all encryption items controlled under ECCNs 5A002, 5B002,
5D002 and 5E002.  This conforms with the practice under the ITAR prior to
December 30, 1996.
- In �750.7, authorizes certain specified changes to Commerce and State
Encryption Licensing Arrangements by letter.
- In �752.3, excludes encryption items controlled for EI reasons from
eligibility for a Special Comprehensive License.
- In �770.2, adds a new interpretation to clarify that encryption software
controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 may be pre-loaded on a laptop
and exported under the tools of trade provision of License Exception TMP or
the personal use exemption under License Exception BAG, subject to the
terms and conditions of such License Exceptions.
- In part 772, adds new definitions for "effective control", "encryption
licensing arrangement", "financial institution" and "recovery encryption
- In Supplement No. 1 to part 774, Category 5 - Telecommunications and
Information Security is amended by revising ECCN 5A002 to authorize exports
of components and spare parts under License Exception LVS, provided the

$treet Journal, August 22, 1997, p. A7A.
   Hackers' Paradise: Get Wealthy Legally By Cracking a Code
   Crypto-Logic Offers to Pay $1 Million to the Breaker Of
   Encryption for E-Mail    By Rodney Ho
   A start-up company would like you to hack your way to $1
   million.
   Crypto-Logic Corp. of Austin, Texas, claims to have created
   an encryption system for electronic mail so foolproof that
   it can't be broken. If someone can figure out a special
   encrypted e-mail message within a year, the company says it
   will pay a reward of $1 million.
   But wait. The technology Crypto-Logic is using for the
   contest hasn't exactly been foolproof. The three computers
   needed to create the contest's Web site unexpectedly
   scrambled data in the site last week, said David Neeley,
   vice president and chief operating officer.
   The breakdown forced him to backtrack from last week's
   announcement that the contest would begin last Friday.
   Instead, he spent several days attempting to fix the
   computers, but to no avail. On Monday, he had to get
   replacement computers. "I've got thousands of dollars worth
   of machinery that's not worth blowing up," he grouses. But
   he adds, "I regard this as my screw-up. In this world,
   there are no excuses." He finally got the contest running
   Wednesday, at    On the bright side, cryptologists agree that the
   decades-old encryption method that Crypto-Logic is claiming
   to use -- called a "one-time pad" -- is theoretically
   unbreakable. Each "pad" has a set of uniquely random
   digital symbols that are coded to the actual message. The
   recipient uses the same symbols to decrypt the message. The
   pads are used only once.
   To limit the possibility of leaks, Crypto-Logic Chairman
   Stan Spence is the only person who knows the message that
   was encrypted. The solution is kept in a NationsBank vault
   in Austin, Mr. Spence says. In addition, Mr. Neeley says
   the $1 million is backed by an insurance company he won't
   name.
   Several other companies have held similar contests,
   typically offering more modest sums.
   Jim Bidzos, president of RSA Data Security Inc. in Redwood
   City, Calif., says his company frequently holds break-the-
   code contests to test how tough certain encryption systems
   are. But he and other security experts are skeptical of
   Crypto-Logic's assertions. "Anyone who says their system is
   bulletproof is either a liar or stupid," says Winn
   Schwartau, a Largo, Fla., security expert.
   Mr. Neeley admits his integrity is on the line. "If I'm
   wrong," he notes, "we're out of business."

NYT reported yesterday on the national labs efforts to attract
commercial clients to offset declines in national security funding, with Sandia being featured.
   We've been receiving from Bill Payne, ex-Sandia cryptographer,
a series of reports and letters on what's happening to enraged
Sandia scientists and staff as the budgets decline and piddling
new missions are sought, while facing the congressional threat to close all the labs and the entire Department of Energy. We'll offer
one of the astute assessments shortly which describes the
bind imported managers are in to turn the labs into dog-eat-dog corporate sweatshops, and how the not so dumb scientists are learning to fuck with the heads of the hatcheters, refusing to work,
bickering, prolonging disputes, sabotaging projects, maybe/maybe not whispering secrets to bad people in other countries, or worst of all, disclosing vital national information to commercial interests, that
is, outfox management by arranging a private deal.
As the NY Times recently reported on the fearsome threats nuclear weapons scientists are making to keep funding coming, noting that the Russians are doing the same, all rather brilliantly saying: keep us "peacekeepers" doing the dirty work happy or suffer the consequences when the loyal patriotic guards go over the fence, or simpler, open the gates, that is sell the PAL codes, barter the diagrams, to maintain our "entitlement".
Yep, the Sandia manager claims that the best and brightest scientists
of the US believe that their dole should be for life. Or they are going to
get very black market ammo oriented, that's market-Oriented.
The Times editorialized today that the nation's leaders must not give
in to nuclear blackmail from its own professional nuclear blackmailers.

The GAO reports that the B-2 stealth bomber cannot fly in the rain,
which transforms stealth technology into junk. Moreover, the fragile machine needs strict atmospheric control in the hangar or its skin rots and delicate innards peter out, and because there are none of the luxurious digs overseas, the plane cannot be deployed closer to targets, thereby limiting its threat. The problem is apparently unsolvable for less than the cost of the plane itself, so they've got to be pickled and coddled indefinitely or thrown away.
   Once armaments, tactics and strategy were battle-tested by using them for war, now with high-price simulation being widely deployed
to save money, it's pretty certain that the price of war games will eventually rise to cost exactly the same as an actual war, indeed
will make war a cheaper alternative.
What's a wonder is that GAO never finds serious fault with any of
the government programs it judiciously investigates. Instead, after due research, request for comments from those investigated, and
fair deliberation, the somewhat tawdry matters at hands merely require additional funding for fine tuning and keep the congressional sponsors happy to fund the programs, the watch-dogs and shrewdly voting taxpayers doing what needs to be done to complain and bank
their cut, short 10% for all the world's sterling leaders. Jeez, is this a California dream of virtual reality war games forever or the bleeding edge of the future set in motion at the dawn of:

CNN Online, 26 August 1997:
Encryption rules rejected Judge says federal regulations barring unlicensed exports unconstitutional San Francisco, Aug 25 (Reuter) - U.S. government regulations on the export
of encryption software are unconstitutional, a federal judge ruled on Monday. U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel said licensing requirements
for the export of encryption software and related devices were an
unconstitutional prior restraint on First Amendment free speech rights.
Patel also issued a permanent injunction barring the government
from enforcing the regulations against plaintiff Daniel Bernstein or anyone
who sought to use, discuss or publish his encryption program.

I'd like to applaud all those who've been working on this legal hack for
years now, keeping flatfeet to fire. For mind-opening, hard-headed reading, in addition to Froomkin and Bernstein, see the briefs on Karn and Junger, see Gilmore's files, study all the crypto sites which show the depth of
research that has often had to be ripped out of the government'g tight paws still fiercely resisting loss of control over "the national interest."
Tim's "crazy man" threat, artfully delineated in his CA Manifesto and Cyphernomicon, who might just do what "rational minds" won't, is also to be admired for reminding the insiders that not everyone abides the rules of the court when they are not wisely applied for this time and these newly divergent, even anarchic, interests. Read Tim for inspiration when the
briefs numb, then go back and study the briefs some more, and you'll
see that they don't read the same, there's more fire there than appears
at first glance, then return to Tim and see that, well, god damn, so that's what he's saying and we've not been really hearing. Shit, he's crazier, the briefs are crazier, the government's crazier than rational minds can
bear to believe.
When you can't take them any more, read Duncan Frissell, and freak with
terrible understanding that the world you've long thought solid and, forever
around to complain about and blame, may be crumbling, that we're going to

It's available in PDF format at:

The report proposes an impressive 30-year overhaul for the military, with a recommendation that the two-major-wars strategy be replaced with that of preparing for one major war and a host of more limited defenses overseas and at home to combat enemies who will not challenge superior conventional armaments but will utilize "asymmetrical" NBC weapons, terrorism, information We've converted the Executive Summary to HTML:
   And a section on "Homeland Defense" which proposes a role for military forces to "protect against all enemies foreign and domestic" by providing intelligence, training, equipment and other aid to justice and law enforcement.
   As noted in the NYT today, the report asks for a shakeup in
intelligence, with renewed emphasis on training human spies
to compensate for what technology cannot do.
Along that line, the NYT also reports today on a huge Libyan
deeply-buried pipeline system under construction which is suspected of being a distribution system for troops and equipment as well as CB weapons, placed underground to escape satellite
spies. The report is based on descriptions of engineers and
corporations working on the project.
One feature of the NDP report, as well as other closed defense
panel meetings, is the need for weapons to attack underground

and the US for that matter -- Cheyenne Mountain is still being

Hackers Out for IP Blood with New Land Attack  The Internet underworld last week unsheathed a new weapon  capable of knocking out IP-based routers and servers, sending  vendors scrambling to find ways to safeguard their gear.  Land Attack, officially known as land.c program code, was posted  on the Net by someone called "Meltman" and used last week in  attacks on Cisco Systems, Inc. routers and Unix and Windows  NT servers. Some of the targeted machines were slowed to a  crawl, while others had to be rebooted.  Land Attack represents a new twist on the dreaded "TCP SYN  flooding" denial-of-service attack.  But unlike TCP SYN flooding, Land Attack sends out just one  sinister SYN packet in which the sending devices IP address has  been swapped out for the IP address of the destination machine.  When the destination machine tries to acknowledge receipt of the  transmission, it ends up using its own address, which means it
 sends the message back to itself, resulting in a potentially fatal
 loopback condition. "If someone could find a way to use this  Land Attack program to spread this across the Internet, it could  cause major service disruptions," said Chris Klaus, chief

 Right to Privacy for Sale in Cyberspace; SynData Technologies Inc. Speaks Out  Against Key Recovery
 Cedar Grove, N.J. -- SynData Technologies Inc., a provider of encryption
software  solutions, released a statement today condemning Network Associates Inc., the  market leader for virus protection software products, for supporting the
government's  key recovery program. Network Associates Inc., formerly known as McAfee
Associates Inc.,
 recently purchased Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) for $36 million, an encryption
 software provider. PGP had historically been opposed to key recovery.  "It is time to seriously consider the threat that Network Associates poses
to the
 individual's constitutional right to privacy," said David Romanoff, CEO of
 Technologies Inc. "While Network Associates claims to protect privacy in
 cyberspace, they have actually traded our right to privacy for a shot at
 revenues overseas by supporting the key recovery program. The slippery slope
 has begun right under our noses. It's time to challenge both the government and
 companies who support the government's key recovery program before it is too
 late."  The United States Commerce Department does not allow US encryption software
 makers to export strong encryption without a key recovery program. Companies
 who do not believe in the government's key recovery program are forced to
 develop both export and domestic versions of their software, each with a
 strength.  "The government's key recovery program is a complete violation of the
 individual's right to privacy and, in fact, compromises of the system are
 taking place. This shows that key escrow is an untenable policy," said Bruce
 Schneier, one of the world's leading authorities on encryption and author
of the
 book "Applied Cryptography". "SynData is paving the way for other software
 developers by taking a stand in opposition to the government and companies like
 Network Associates."  SynData Technologies does not believe in key recovery or other government
 involvement in the regulation of the encryption software industry. The company
 also believes that the current export curbs on encryption put the entire
industry at
 a competitive disadvantage. Additionally, these policies undermine the
security of
 the global marketplace and put the individual's right to privacy at risk.  SynData Technologies Inc., based in Cedar Grove, New Jersey, unveiled their
 flagship encryption software product, SynCrypt, in September of this year.
 SynCrypt is available directly from SynData Technologies, 800-499-1469, and

Has Phil Zimmermann responded to the months long  criticism
of PGP 5.0 for Business and PGP's acquisition by Network
If not, what seems to be the most reasonable explanation for
Phil not answering, to allay suspicions and sustain PGP's
worldwide reputation? The explanations by others working
with PGP, Inc. would surely be more credible if Phil expressed public support for their views.
I still find it hard to accept that Phil would squander his personal
reputation, and thereby the reputation of his invention, by
refusing to provide a public accounting of what's happening
with PGP Inc. And, no matter the legal and financial restrictions
that might be contraining him. And no matter that PGP's
competitors are probably encouraging some of the attacks.
Security by obscurity, by indifference to public doubts, seems
to be a surefire way to undermine Phil's years long struggle
to distinguish himself from those less courageous than him
who are pushing products less reliable than PGP has been
believed to be until now.
It's a haunting thought to consider that Phil may have been
shown evidence by others that PGP is not as reliable as many have long believed, evidence that perhaps demonstrates what
he knew all along. This is harsh suspicion and one that needs
his response, if for no other reason to allay the fear that even
prior versions of PGP are now suspect.
PGP and Phil's personal reputation are at stake, not PGP, Inc., which is secondary. There are lots of folks whose freedom, if not lives, may be at risk due to his silence.
Perhaps it's time for Phil to reaffirm that difficult choice between success and conviction, between making a killing and betraying others to do so. To remind those who think you can have both ways and get away with it is a cowardly fantasy too often hidden behind self-serving ethics.
If Phil personally (not the PGP officer, not the distinguished scientist
bullshit role, not the PGP employees) refuses to stand behind PGP as it has been known and trusted, then PGP and Phil should be denounced forever as a grand deception and treachery, even worse than the other crypto products eagerly shaped -- and openly proud of it -- to fit the specs of the paymaster snoops Phil himself once bravely challenged.
I think Phil will come through now, as he has in the past, to distinguish
himself and PGP (not Inc.) from the craven pack.
If he doesn't, it's smart to give up using PGP in all its guises past and

Bell gets 11 months in prison, 3
                years supervised release, fine                              The Associated Press
                           12/12/97 7:54 PM Eastern
             TACOMA (AP) -- A federal judge Friday imposed an 11-month
             sentence for tax violations on James Dalton Bell, whose 10-part
             Internet essay, "Assassination Politics," proposed apparent
             "bounties" on government officials.              Federal prosecutors say he was advocating bounties on public
             officials he considered "miscreants" and "slimeballs." Bell has
             he was theorizing, not advocating any killing.              The Vancouver, Wash., man pleaded guilty in July to trying to
             impede Internal Revenue Service agents and to using false Social
             Security numbers to hide his assets.              After his prison term, U.S. District Judge Franklin Burgess
             ordered Bell to undergo three years of supervised release. He also
             was ordered to pay $1,359 in restitution for damage caused by a
             stink bomb he set off at the IRS's Vancouver office.              Bell's essay was cited in the indictment as a means by which he
             sought to intimidate IRS agents, Assistant U.S. Attorney Annmarie
             Levins said.              A news release from federal prosecutors says that as part of his
             plea agreement, Bell "admitted advocating a scheme called
             `Assassination Politics' whereby persons would be rewarded with
             `digital cash' through the Internet for killing undesirable
people.              "Bell identified government employees, particularly IRS
             employees, as such undesirable people, and argued that the threat
             of `Assassination Politics' would intimidate them from enforcing
             Internal Revenue laws for fear of being assassinated."              He also admitted proposing "Assassination Politics" as an
             enforcement mechanism for the anti-government Oregon extremist
             group Multnomah County Common Law Court, which purports to
             try government officials for performance of their duties, the
             release said.              Prosecutors and Bell's public defender sought a sentence of 6 to
             12 months as part of a plea bargain. Federal probation officers
             recommended 27 months, citing the "totality" of Bell's behavior.              Bell described "Assassination Politics" as a means for ordinary
             citizens to take action against public officials they perceived as
             having violated their rights.              "What if they could go to their computers, type in the miscreant's
             name and select a dollar amount. The amount they, themselves,
             would be willing to pay to anyone who `predicts' that
             officeholder's death," he wrote.              "That donation would be sent, encrypted and anonymously, to a
             central registry organization and be totaled, with the total amount
             available within seconds to any interested individual."              He noted that if one person in 1,000 "was willing to pay $1 to see
             some government slimeball dead, that would be, in effect, a
             $250,000 bounty on his head."              In an April raid on the home Bell shared with his elderly parents,
             authorities found the home addresses of about 70 IRS employees,
             as well as three semiautomatic assault rifes, a handgun and
             potentially deadly chemicals. He was arrested in May.

To add to Greg Broiles' excellent recap of the case.
What might be amplified is the way Jim's case was
gnoshed in the media and here, with more attention to AP than to the basic facts, as exemplified in the news report
on sentencing, as Phill did, as did the IRS spam of Jim's
Fair enough, for that was clearly the purpose of AP,
as with all publishing and speaking in a manner to get
attention, whether by IRS-fed scare stories churned out
by its PR department, by we advocates of earnest causes,
and by the eager-to-oblige news, law and pol biz -- FC
not excepted.
Jim's case was happily churned by all parties, us foremost
among them, and Jim (with aid and abet by others) is to be congratulated for success with AP: Agent Provocative, Apt Promo, Avid Preening for and against. May he quickly
capitalize on his notoriety and beat the pack of envious competitors waving less risky, lawful docs which attract
Now, is it not true that we've self-censored ourselves into believing Jim is just a fool, rather than a gutsy guy willing to do what most
of us will not, instead preferring covert self-censorship over the all-too-easily opposed group-think kind.
If so, the IRS (with aid and abet by news, law and pol) has proven a gov-authorized version of AP and warning spam quite nicely
intimidates us into censoring ourselves into well-behaved
submission while believing its a shrewd move to protect careers
from wiser fools like Jim Bell.

2-4-97. Reuters:
Global group fails to endorse Clinton encryption plan Washington: An influential economic research group is preparing guidelines on computer encryption for its member countries but will duck some of the most contentious issues involved, according to a draft obtained by Reuters.
The Clinton administration, seeking to rally support for its controversial policy on exporting encryption products -- which encode and decode e-mail and other computerized messages -- failed to win an endorsement from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), although the group did discuss the
administration's approach.
On perhaps the most difficult issue, the draft guidelines do not favour or oppose a requirement in the U.S. policy that data-scrambling encryption programmes provide a way for law enforcement officials to obtain keys to crack the codes when necessary.
After indicating that governments should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of imposing so-called key recovery, the draft report said, "this principle should not be interpreted as implying that governments should, or should not, initiate legislation that would allow lawful On all the controversial areas in the draft, "the member countries of the OECD have strongly held views but they don't always coincide," John Dryden, head of the group's Information, Computer and Communications Policy division, said in a telephone interview from Paris.
Some countries see widespread use of encryption as a way to protect the privacy of computer users and businesses, thereby encouraging global commerce, Dryden said. But others see encryption as possibly thwarting law enforcement's efforts to catch riminals and global terrorists, he The guidelines suggest encryption users should have access to products that meet their needs. Government controls should be "no more than are essential to the discharge of government responsibilities."
Instead of reconciling the different views, the draft guidelines lay out competing interests and approaches.
"It's not in itself a cryptography policy and it's not an attempt to draft a model national law that we're encouraging people to adopt," Dryden said. Cryptography refers to products and systems used in The guidelines also suggest encryption standards and usage should be "determined by the market in an open and competitive environment."
"There's a strong view that the private sector should have the possibility to use information networks to the best of their potential in order to create growth and jobs," Dryden said.
U.S. officials who have seen the preliminary draft praised the guidelines. "They're an important and helpful step forward," Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch said.
"They're helpful because they put down on paper the proper foundation for getting into this," he added.
Reinsch said most countries will follow the U.S. lead and require so-called key recovery features for law enforcement. Under the Clinton policy, domestic use of encryption is not regulated but the strongest coding products cannot be exported unless they include key recovery.
U.S. companies that have opposed the Clinton policy, contending it stifles their ability to compete with unfettered foreign firms, drew little solace from the draft guidelines.
"This is not helpful," said Netscape Communications Corp.'s public policy counsel, Peter Harter. Netscape and other companies preferred stronger language endorsing free-market policies, he said.
The draft guidelines, approved by a group of government and private-sector experts at a meeting at the end of January, still must be approved by a top-level OECD officials from the group's 29 member countries, including the United States.

Major Organizations Are Experimenting With Computer Chip Implants in
Humans, According to EE Times Special Report
Manhasset, N.Y., Feb. 4 -- The implantation of computer chips into humans and animals is now actively being funded, researched and experimented by major institutions such as Stanford University, British Telecom, the National Institute of Health (NIH) and major corporations, according to the first of a two-part special report published by EE Times ( Although the work is drawing fire from civil libertarians and conspiracy theorists, among others, many scientists and physicians defend the work for its potential to ease suffering.
"It's 'Total Recall' come true! Our in-depth look into this state-of-
the- art research reveals that the mix of electrical engineering and medical technologies to surgically implant computer chip-driven devices is here today -- a micro chip implant is simply one step beyond a pacemaker," said EE Times Internet Editor Larry Lange.
According to the EE Times report, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (Tokyo) recently developed a low-cost input device that can recognize human movement and convert it to commands for use in software applications. This device is expected to find its way into tools used by people with disabilities. On other fronts, the semiconductor research lab at Motorola Inc. is working on body-embedded electronic blood-sensors that may one day allow diabetics to measure their blood sugar levels without ever drawing a drop of blood.
The special report, appearing in next week issue in print and online, looks at additional areas of research and the differing reactions to it.

On perhaps the most difficult issue, the draft guidelines do not favour or oppose a requirement in the U.S. policy that data-scrambling encryption programmes provide a way for law enforcement officials to obtain keys to crack the codes when necessary.
After indicating that governments should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of imposing so-called key recovery, the draft report said, "this principle should not be interpreted as implying that governments should, or should not, initiate legislation that would allow lawful On all the controversial areas in the draft, "the member countries of the OECD have strongly held views but they don't always coincide," John Dryden, head of the group's Information, Computer and Communications Policy division, said in a telephone interview from Paris.
Some countries see widespread use of encryption as a way to protect the privacy of computer users and businesses, thereby encouraging global commerce, Dryden said. But others see encryption as possibly thwarting law enforcement's efforts to catch riminals and global terrorists, he The guidelines suggest encryption users should have access to products that meet their needs. Government controls should be "no more than are essential to the discharge of government responsibilities."
Instead of reconciling the different views, the draft guidelines lay out competing interests and approaches.
"It's not in itself a cryptography policy and it's not an attempt to draft a model national law that we're encouraging people to adopt," Dryden said. Cryptography refers to products and systems used in The guidelines also suggest encryption standards and usage should be "determined by the market in an open and competitive environment."
"There's a strong view that the private sector should have the possibility to use information networks to the best of their potential in order to create growth and jobs," Dryden said.
U.S. officials who have seen the preliminary draft praised the guidelines. "They're an important and helpful step forward," Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch said.
"They're helpful because they put down on paper the proper foundation for getting into this," he added.
Reinsch said most countries will follow the U.S. lead and require so-called key recovery features for law enforcement. Under the Clinton policy, domestic use of encryption is not regulated but the strongest coding products cannot be exported unless they include key recovery.
U.S. companies that have opposed the Clinton policy, contending it stifles their ability to compete with unfettered foreign firms, drew little solace from the draft guidelines.
"This is not helpful," said Netscape Communications Corp.'s public policy counsel, Peter Harter. Netscape and other companies preferred stronger language endorsing free-market policies, he said.
The draft guidelines, approved by a group of government and private-sector experts at a meeting at the end of January, still must be approved by a top-level OECD officials from the group's 29 member countries, including the United States.

USA: Industry Groups Blast U.S. Encryption Policy.
Washington, Feb 13 (Reuter) - An array of private-sector trade groups charged Thursday the Clinton administration's new export policy on computer encoding technology was a failure. Encryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software "key," are subject to strict export limits, although the administration recently relaxed the rules a bit. The new policy "does not adequately address the needs of either the American business community or the general public," the 13 groups said in a letter to Clinton dated Wednesday and released Thursday. Among the groups signing the letter were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Retail Federation, along with a host of high-tech industry groups such as the
Business Software Alliance and the Information Technology Association of America. The Centre for Democracy and Technology, an advocacy group for civil liberties in cyberspace, and the Association of Research Libraries also signed the letter. An administration spokeswoman said that, despite the complaints, the current policy would be maintained. "The administration is moving ahead with our encryption export liberalisation policy," spokeswoman Heidi Kukis said. The policy balances diverse interests by "allowing us to develop exports while protecting our national security," she said. The administration has repeatedly said it opposes allowing unfettered powerful encryption programmes out of the country where they could be used by international criminals and terrorists. Under current policy, U.S. companies cannot export products containing so-called strong encryption, used to protect everything from a business' electronic mail to a consumer's credit card number sent over the Internet,
unless the products also allow the government to crack the code by recovering the software keys. Companies can get a license to export medium-strength encryption lacking so-called key recovery features if the companies agree to incorporate key recovery in future products within two years. The Commerce Department has issued three licenses so far under the two-year provision. Digital Equipment Corp., Trusted Information Systems Inc., and Cylink Corp. won approval by promising to offer key recovery
products by 1999. International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett Packard Co. have said they are also seeking licenses. But companies and privacy advocates rejected the administration's key recovery-based approach. "It fails to accommodate the competitiveness concerns of sellers of encryption products, the security concerns of the buyers of such products, or important privacy rights," the groups said in their letter. "We believe a fundamental rethinking of this policy is necessary," they added. "We remain interested in working with you to achieve a constructive solution to this very difficult problem." Congress is already considering proposals to dramatically relax the export restrictions without requiring key recovery.

in February IEEE Spectrum:

Recently Bellcore    announced a paper, "Cryptanalysis in the presence of hardware faults"    (available at  that proposed a theoretical method for
   breaking an asymmetric encryption code once a computer (or a    smartcard microcontroller) had been forced into faulty behavior.
   The Smart Card Forum, a multi-industry membership organization    headquartered in Tampa, Fla., has stated that it does not regard this    approach as a real-world risk, since in smartcard applications more    than one technique is used to protect the security of the entire system.    But the Bellcore methodology for breaking algorithms -- as well as    similar theoretical approaches, such as the one taken by two Israeli    researchers, Eli Biham and Adi Shamir -- highlights the need to    analyze and evolve the security of any system continually.

  Quisquater and the SG group also note the reluctance of smartcard
mass-marketers to own up to security shortcomings of which their own
engineers know and fret.
Meanwhile, the DFA proponents and opponents are eagerly absorbing the continuing DFA-relatged reports, quietly watching one another, and both sides eying the booming smartcard market for lucrative rewards, as Ms. Francher suggests: licit and il.

Here're wee additions to your archive:
I subbed to cp-unedited from the first, so could compare the unedited messages with the edited. Some of mine(*) were edited, including a few
on the Stronghold topic. But to me that's not as big a deal as some want
to make of it.
For example, in response to Tim's request to repost DV's Stronghold ploy, I did so, and it was edited. Sandy sent me a courteous email stating that he was not forwarding the message. I answered that that was okay with me because I thought that DV was using the issue as a ploy to undermine Sandy. Hey, there were no legal or other threats made to me, darn it!
Another of my edited messages stated that there had been good discussion
on the unedited list about DV's Denial of Service attack on Cypherpunks.
Another noted that DV had been admirably successful in drawing others into
his fight -- in support and in opposition -- as part of his DoS.
Another questioned "Who's Censoring Who?" and offered the opinion that "censorship" rhetorically exaggerated Sandy's moderation. (I still believe that's the case.)
For what it's worth, I oppose moderation, but favor experimentation, in
the recognition that humans are near-endlessly adaptable and near-
uncontrollable no matter what control mechanisms are employed -- anarchy
is the norm whether advocated or not.
So, I think the moderation experiment was a success, in that it has led to an unexpectedly constructive reconfiguration of Cypherpunks -- and not the last, that's for sure -- and showed that any archy is wishful dreaming of tortured
hearts and minds and loins.
A one hand applause to Dr. V and archy-demolishers for vibrating the c'punks

We already know that Sandy's bot automatically discards submissions from

articles were tossed to the "flames" list.  Now Sandy has gone one step further.  The following article criticized the product Sandy is paid to

so much that it hasn't made it to EITHER censored or the 'flames' list!

My version of DV's ploy came via the unedited list.
There was also a good, brief discussion about Vulis's multi-pronged
Denial of Service attack on Cypherpunks, which came unedited, along with other informative comments about how a technologically adept attacker singles out a quarry amongst a lumbering, slumbering, cud-
chewing herd. Quite beastly cryptoanarchistic.

Sandy's e-mailed several of us who've sent messages about Vulis's
ploy to put Sandy in a conflict-of-interest bind -- a well-known attack on moderators of all kinds, not just on the net. What's worth admiring is how Vulis has adeptly managed to get others
 -- targets and witting and unwitting cohorts -- to go along with his attack, attack, attack, by opposing or supporting it. A useful lesson.
Smart dude, that Vulis, but no more so than others on the Net, say, Tim
May, and in the world who've done the same elsewhere, maybe by even smarter dude(s) who provoked, angered, insulted, an unwitting Vulis, or May, to attack on behalf of ... But such deception is to be expected, along with feigned suprise and
outrage at the unfairness of opponents fighting as dirty as one's own
Sandy's not censoring cypherpunks, nor is Vulis or May or any single person alone. As Pogo said, it's all of us, posters and lurkers and spooks, each trying to get one's way to prevail, under guise of a high principle not easily honored when the squeeze is on alone in a dark cell. Come on out
Sandy, it was just a drill.
It's probably worth saving accusations of censorship for the real thing, after trial usage here for what is truly nasty high-stakes global info-war [Note: Thorn, "cuckoo" and TCM responded to this; none were forwarded
to the cp-edited list, AFIK.]

Three newspapers have pieces today on the new WTO
telecom agreement. A Page 1 NYP report examines the
administration's favoring of the once-moribund WTO over the UN as a principal means for "exporting US free-market values through global commercial agreements."
The telecom agreement, for the first time, allows the WTO
to go inside the signatory countries and check compliance, and
if warranted, impose sanctions, a role once reserved to the UN.
While encryption is not mentioned, it's worth watching the
WTO globally unite its privacy-invasive predecessors: the national tele-tappers. The spin is that now all governments can have access to the global (wiretap) network under guise of
enhanced commercial competition. (And that's why Commerce was given EI for CCL.)
For related background, there's informative discussion on the encryption switchover from State to Commerce in the Defense Trade News, archived at the Dept of State Web site.

Mike Cobb's and Peter Gutmann's tales of mixed signals from
UK and NZ security agencies on exporting crypto demonstrate the same conflicting policies of their nations' governments as do
the travails of Zimmermann, Bernstein, Karn and Junger with the
USG -- lacking clear regulations, the agencies try bluff and The US move to clarify and tighten regulations in recent ITAR and
EAR amendments surely will be emulated by other nations, as
promised by The Wassenaar Arrangement.
It is part of the major shift of responsibility for dual-use items from national security agencies to those handling economic security, and
the guidelines are not as black and white for commerce as they are
for state -- or at least not as yet strictly codified, regulated and enforced.
However, what is happening with crypto is happening with a wide range of dual-use items, as the half-century old national security policy undergoes a transformation into economic security policy, with
the pervasive impact on subsidiary procedures and regulations in security, armaments, intelligence, research, invention, manufacturing, law, finance, politics, education and so on.
Note that the World Trade Organization is supplanting the United Nations as a forum for dispute resolution (NY Times, 18 February 1997). For more on these State-into-Commerce policy deliberations see:
The GAO/NSIAD report "Exporting Dual-Use Items," 14 January 1997:    Export Administration Regulations, with related presidential orders and agency rules and regulations:

   Domestic CIA Snooping
   The CIA's assertion on its Web page that the agency does
   not keep files on Americans is not in fact true ["In the
   Loop," Federal Page, Feb. 12]. The agency opened a file on
   my client, Daniel Tsang, a political activist and librarian
   at the University of California at Irvine, in the 1980s and
   recorded his constitutionally protected activities.
   When we sued the agency, we discovered that no agency
   directives prohibit the maintenance of such files and the
   CIA lawyers made the extraordinary claim that it is legal
   for the agency to keep files on Americans, including on
   citizens' First Amendment activities. The CIA claimed that
   it is exempt from Privacy Act restrictions on such
   practices.
   While the CIA eventually agreed to expunge Mr. Tsang's file
   and promised to refrain from opening such files on him in
   the future, it refused to acknowledge any limitation on its
   authority to keep files on other Americans. It should do so
   now.

   "6. Compromised Names Database. The purpose of the    database is to notify US intelligence community personnel    whose names were potentially compromised as a result of    espionage or other foreign intelligence collection activity.    NACIC reviews pertinent reports to determine documents    that were possibly passed in a particular case and then    reviews those documents for names. The database contains    the names of persons potentially compromised, date of the    memo sent to the person or their employer informing them,    the document number of where the person's name came    from, document title, and document date."

Report: Europe OKs Wiretap Rules
London (AP) -- Europe has agreed to establish international standards with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations to enable authorities to tap telephones and messages sent by fax, telex and e-mail, a London newspaper reported Tuesday. The Guardian newspaper said it obtained a preliminary agreement signed by European Union nations in 1995 that calls for telecommunications companies to provide security agencies with the key to codes installed in equipment sold to customers. The newspaper report could not be confirmed independently. The aim of the alliance between U.S. and EU agencies was to set a common standard for "international interception,'' the newspaper reported. Full details on the agreement are being drawn up by officials working in European Union committees, it said. The report said European officials drafted a memorandum of understanding after Britain warned that mobile telephone systems in the hands of organized criminals posed an international threat.

UK to join FBI phone taps
Richard Norton-Taylor and Alison Daniels
BRITAIN has secretly agreed with its European Union partners to set up
an international telecommunications tapping system in co-operation
with the FBI, it was revealed on Monday.
The agreement covers telephones and written communications -- telexes,
faxes and e-mail. To make tapping easier, telecommunications companies
will be obliged to give security and intelligence agencies the key to
codes installed in equipment sold to private customers.
Detailed plans are being drawn up by officials in a secret network of
EU committees established under the "third pillar" of the Maastricht
Treaty, covering co-operation on law and order issues.
Civil liberties groups, while agreeing that there was a need for such
an agreement to fight against serious crime, said the plans raised a
number of privacy and data protection issues and must be the subject
of a full public debate.
Britain is an enthusiastic supporter of joint action in this area,
which is conducted on an inter-governmental basis with no role for the
European Commission, the European Parliament or the European Court of
Justice. It is an area where the EU's "democratic deficit" is most
Key points of the plan are outlined in a memorandum of understanding
signed by EU states in 1995, which is still classified. It reflects
increasing concern among European intelligence agencies that modern
technology will prevent them from tapping private communications.
EU governments agreed to co-operate closely with the FBI in Washington
as they work out detailed plans.

  -- Notify consumers about how personal information collected online is

  information is used.
  -- Ensure the security of personal information is protected.
  -- Give consumers access to their own personal information to ensure its

We've digtized the 200-page "Information Warfare-

    It's quite informative about large-scale planning
for coping with the threats of information age --
encryption among many other political, economic,
technical and legal issues. There is overlap with
the NRC cryptography report on prospects for
technological fixes to security, but this report
envisions a much more comprehensive plan. (William Ware served on both panels; Stewart Baker on the IW-D.)
Comparison to threat models of the Center for Disease Control, FEMA and the National Drug Intelligence Center
is provocative (Appendix D).
Well worth reading for a preview of the next century's opportunities for wealth, power and infamy.

is an acronym for Caller Authentication and Voice Encryption.
It has apparently gone through several versions -- whether
getting progressively stronger or weaker is a question soon to be answered authentically?

A challenge on the ignored Ninth Amendment:
1-14-97. Washington Times, p. A14:
Why not just repeal the forgotten Ninth Amendment
Your Jan. 9 article on the "assisted suicide" issue argued before the U.S. Supreme Court does not mention the Ninth Amendment once ("High court wrestles with assisted suicide"). I was not surprised. Democrats and Republicans consistently ignore the Ninth (and appoint judges who likewise ignore it).
The Ninth Amendment states: "The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." By ignoring this plain wording, the judiciary displays a reluctance to "create new constitutional rights," an admirable sentiment. Considering that no one seems to take it seriously, perhaps we should consider repealing the "forgotten" Ninth Amendment.
After all, it seems to be written in invisible ink on just about every copy of the Bill of Rights owned by journalists and the judiciary. It is never the basis if deciding cases. Instead, it just clutters up the Bill of Rights and causes libertarians to prattle on endlessly about individual rights. I believe it would be healthy for this country to debate repealing the Ninth Although I am opposed to the idea of repealing it, I am just as opposed to the idea of ignoring parts of the Bill of Rights. Perhaps my proposed debate will cause some lawyers, journalists, judges and Supreme Court justices to reconsider their present Jim Ray
Miami, Fla.
Mr. Ray is chairman of the Dade County Libertarian Party Organization.

"At the New Frontier of Eavesdropping." Markoff.
  Many phone companies are now rushing to introduce new
  digital services that provide better sound quality. But
  when security standards were set for the new systems five
  years ago, technical experts from the Government
  discouraged the phone companies from building in coding
  systems that would be difficult to break. Moreover, the
  phone companies themselves decided that real privacy was
  not a major issue. "Time to market turned out to be more   important than real security," said John Gilmore.
  Indeed, in recent weeks the supposedly secret formula for
  scrambling digital wireless phone calls was posted to an
  Internet mailing list. That virtually insures that hackers
  will soon create a way to modify scanners like the one the
  Martins used, making digital calls just as vulnerable as
  analog calls are today. "There's a period in which privacy   prevails over surveillance, but it's never for very long."

"Unstoppable Internet will defy controls"
 Governments which seek to restrain the freedom of speech and tax  the vast electronic commerce spawned by the Internet will almost certainly  be wasting their time, experts say, and that any attempt to control  traffic over the Internet will be futile. Governments in China, Burma and  Singapore have already tried to discipline this on-line activity with  minimal success.
 Dr Bob Glass of Sun Microsystems Inc said any attempt by governments to  curtail any of this would be a waste of time. Not even the most powerful  computers will be able to effectively patrol the world's telephone lines.  Individual computer experts will always be one step ahead.
 "Big brother is out there trying to monitor this, but I don't think they're
 competent enough," he said. "Government is not really aware of the
 magnitude of money exchange on the web, but there's really not much they
 can do about it."
 Professor Patrick Purcell from London's Imperial College describes the
 Internet as a highly subversive phenomenom for international
 telecommunications, for a nation's state security and for international
 commerce.

that it was something in the nuclear weapon, earthquake or meteorite range. The Arum sect, which owned 500,000

"Defence experts in both the US and western Europe

Pointers to these comments would be appreciated.
Further, if the speculation of US supremacist go-it-alone
policy is correct, how might this affect:
1. US crypto export policy.
2. Crypto czar Aarons' role in promoting global GAK.
3. Other nation's suspicion of the US and its technological
prowess, caused, for example, by the NSA's avowed intention to surveil all the world's communcation, and if encrypted to crack it at any cost.
4. Increasing isolation of the US from foreign innovation and talent -- the imperialist incest decline.
5. The future of treaties such as US/UK/AUS, NATO, SEATO,
and the like for intel-sharing and crypto control.
Two observations:
One, last year's NRC crypto report said that strong crypto should not be a problem, and that other, unidentified, technologies should be supported instead to assure domestic and national security.
Two, the recent InfoWar-Defense report has been criticized as unduly
alarmist, because the US has sufficient means (Perry and others claim) to protect against information attacks. One NCSC commentator on talk.politics.crypto said that the IW-D techie panelists were out of touch, unlike Stewart Baker, a lawyer!
Hence, it might be worth considering that both the NRC report and
the IW-D reports are diversionary, disinformation to conceal US
true capabilities -- strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, the crypto debate itself might be diversionary from other more crucial information defense technology -- for surveilling, sifting, interpreting, analyzing, decrypting, mining and securely storing. As well as offensive means to counterattack US communications attackers.
Or, turning the matter one more time, perhaps crypto is in fact the heart of the national security problem and the avowed other, unidentified, more
crucial, technology is a sham to mislead about US and other government's
true weaknesses. The Commerce Control List is almost incoherent in
trying to definitively regulate advancing technology.
Paranoia may be increasing among governments due to the crypto debate
and related issues of information security, such that each may, like the
US is allegedly doing, retreating to within its own technological borders, while
at the same time engaging in PsyWar about threats, defenses and offenses.

Is this the same story as the one in The Wall Street Journal today
about Phiber Optic's "accidentally" sending worldwide a security
test that automatically returns passwords stored on supposedly
secure systems?
Phiber claims he did not know the test would generate a flood of
passwords to his e-mail address: from corps, mils, and govs. Says he's so sorry, especially because he's still doing
community service.
Phiber's employer refused to name the computer corp that installed the
secure system Phiber was testing. However, experts interviewed said the password snarf feature is, ahem, well-known to experts, and that the only security worth trusting is the one you build and run yourself and test frequently and still makes you lay awake at night shivering in doubt fear and uncertainty -- like guilty-parental senators, TLA directors, and all the world's bearers of the public trust and such fundy druggies.

@_subject: Bean IRS for Another $250,000 
Four of the IRS messages on Jim Bell came here (see below), two via cypherpunks at toad.com and two directly. (Oddly, none were forwarded
from cyberpass.net as usual for messages to cypherpunks at toad.com.)
There are four messsage IDs, one of which matches that of Alan Olsen
(Number 2 below at 12:29).
These seem to indicate that the sender was using several lists of
addresses, held 18 hours for vetting by the Treasury mail beagles.
Perhaps others could check their message IDs, inquire around listdom in order to assemble a list of targeted lists. Then a stink might be
made for the spam, get that Denver judge to hit "IRS Inspection" for another $250,000 to pay recipients for IRS's lack of proper public humility, if not for Jim's undue imprisonment, isolation by federal defender, coercion of witnesses, distortion of literature, and railroading Jim Bell to warn outlaws to not fuck with Sam's Gang and Roy Bean.
Note: Jim's Roy Bean docket shows that USA v. Bell was assigned to
Judge Franklin D. Burgess on July 9, with new case number 97-CR-5270. The US Attorney filed "Felony Information" on that date. That's the final entry, no listing for the alleged plea bargain.

@_subject: Cerf: Building a Barrier-Free Net 
The New York Times, July 27, 1997, Money & Business, p. 12.
   Viewpoint
   Building an Internet Free of Barriers
   Vinton G. Cerf
      Vinton G. Cerf is senior vice president for Internet
      architecture and engineering at MCI Communications. He
      is a co-inventor of the computer networking protocol
      TCP/IP, which has become the language for Internet
      communications.
   When the subject is global networks like the Internet, the
   magic word is "seamlessness." Seamless global
   communications represents the technological promised land
   of major network providers like mine. For the consumer,
   seamlessness means unimpeded, smooth, clear communications
   among all points within a network and among all networks.
   To the extent that it has developed, seamlessness has been
   the sine qua non, the essential element, behind the
   fast-growing Internet. It is the essence of the links of
   the World Wide Web. The Internet, after all, is not a
   network, or even a medium, in the traditional sense, but a
   network of nearly 200,000 networks and a medium of media,
   encompassing all the long-established ones while creating
   entirely new types. The more seamless we make the Internet
   and, for that matter, the global information
   infrastructure, the quicker we will harness the immense
   potential.
   Although high hurdles of technology and infrastructure
   stare us in the face, obstacles of the political and public
   policy variety are equally daunting. Many policy makers
   fail to grasp that the very seamlessness already found on
   the Internet, coupled with its basic digital nature, makes
   it almost impossible to monitor or regulate its flow of
   information in a hierarchical way. Notwithstanding the
   efforts of certain countries, Big Brother would have real
   problems doing his dirty work on the Internet. Still,
   well-meaning policy makers try to extend longstanding
   social goals to the Internet through heavy-handed,
   market-distorting mandates when industry-led strategies
   could be more effective.
   Of greatest concern to the Internet industry today are the
   many legal quagmires and incoherent policy patchworks that
   hinder Internet commerce. Achieving full seamlessness of
   Internet networks will be impossible if the networks'
   builders must maneuver through inconsistent laws and
   policies. Not only are the policies of many nations in
   conflict, but so are policies within nations -- and to such
   an extreme that some seem mutually exclusive.
   A good example is encryption policy. Encryption technology
   scrambles digital communications to make them
   indecipherable to anyone except the intended receiver. The
   users range from businesses that transmit confidential data
   to individuals who send personal E-mail messages.
   Widespread availability of encryption is a prerequisite for
   enhancing security and privacy on the Internet, for
   engendering a mature electronic marketplace and even for
   helping the work of law enforcement.
   Yet governments resist removing old restrictions on the
   export and use of encryption technology -- rules that date
   from the cold war -- even as they proclaim pro-market
   intentions and stress greater Internet privacy and security
   as priorities.
   Fortunately, growing numbers of key policy makers in the
   advanced democracies are showing a clearer, more
   technologically sophisticated understanding of the
   Internet. They grasp that while government financed the
   start of the Internet, the absence of government has
   largely allowed it to take off like a rocket.
   Within this group are members of Congress like Senators
   Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana, and Patrick Leahy,
   Democrat of Vermont, and Representative Bob Goodlatte,
   Republican of Virginia, who are pushing to liberalize
   encryption export controls.
   Another is Ira C. Magaziner, the White House adviser who
   oversaw the development of a major Administration policy
   paper, released earlier this month, on electronic commerce.
   The paper, which advocated a largely hands-off approach by
   Government to Internet regulation, is a breakthrough in
   electronic commerce policy. Its perspective is properly
   global; its delineated goals, highly commendable.
   Particularly laudable is its proposal to designate the
   Internet as a tariff-free zone.
   The Internet is now perhaps the most global and democratic
   form of communications. No other medium can so easily
   render outdated our traditional distinctions among
   localities, regions and nations. While the Internet
   increasingly knows no boundaries, it still knows barriers
   all too well -- obstacles that are too often born of
   technological ignorance leading to incoherent public
   policy.
   The world cannot afford policies that impede the
   development of the Internet, diminish its utility and limit
   its social reach. And much more could be at stake than
   seamless digital networks. We may find that the more we
   succeed in removing barriers to Internet communications,
   the more we may help reduce those other, far more important
   obstructions to human communications -- the ones that
   divide nations and estrange demographic groups.
   That, ultimately, could be the most far-reaching, enduring
   benefit of an unfettered global Internet.

@_subject: NRO: Risky Methods of Data Exploitation 
Wonder what's meant by "risky methods" NRO envisions in the article below by:
     "Using advanced and potentially technologically risky
     methods of exploiting data to learn more from it."
     30 July 1997, Jane's Defence Weekly
     NRO opens up to new satellite system ideas      For the first time in its history, the once super-secret      National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) is considering whether
     commercial space technology can satisfy its `customer'
     requirements for reconnaissance data needed by the DoD and
     the intelligence community.      In existence for over 30 years, the NRO is coming in from
     the cold for one clear reason: acquisition and operation of US
     reconnaissance satellites continues to account for most of the
     $28 billion in annual spending by the US intelligence
     community. Congress wants to find ways to trim the bill by
     encouraging the NRO to adopt commercial technology and
     move towards launching smaller, less expensive satellites.      The question of whether the NRO should continue to exist
     was an open debate last year. A panel chaired by Adm David
     Jeremiah, former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
     concluded that the unique partnership between the Director of
     Central Intelligence and the Defense Secretary to build,
     operate and manage space-based intelligence systems should
     continue in the form of the NRO.      "There are important inter-relationships between the NRO and
     DoD space activities in areas such as launch technology,
     industrial base and communications, and the NRO needs to
     use DoD systems such as the Global Positioning System as
     well as the DoD needs to use products from NRO systems,"
     the report said. However the panel also emphasised that all of
     the relationships between the NRO and the Pentagon need
     clarification.      NRO Director Keith Hall is driving much of the process at the
     agency towards opening the door to commercial technology
     and improving the agency. "I do not think that a customer
     that needs a picture to answer a key question to make an
     operational decision cares whether that picture comes from
     one of my satellites, an airplane or a commercial sensor
     system," he said. "If that means a commercial system can
     provide some of that, I am entirely for it."      A major vehicle for operational change at the NRO is the
     Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) programme aimed at
     fielding a next-generation space-based imagery intelligence
     (IMINT) system. "We have said to our FIA vendors that they
     are free to propose to us a mixed architecture of government
     systems and commercial systems," said Hall, noting that such
     a notion is indeed a first for the agency. "We have not
     heretofore been involved at all in the acquisition of
     commercial imagery."      The FIA may set a precedent for future reconnaissance
     acquisition. In mid-1996, the NRO and the old Central
     Imagery Office, now part of the NIMA, concluded an initial
     `Phase A' of an architecture study which detailed the
     attributes of a future imagery system most wanted by NRO
     customers. It resulted in the identification of more than 20
     varying performance levels.      The NRO began what it calls the `Phase B' concept
     programme in May last year. It is working with six
     contractor teams and the NIMA to determine "what utility
     would those differences in performance have," said Hall, who
     became director in March.      The NRO expects to publish a final `Phase C' solicitation to
     industry with detailed performance specifications by early
     next year. Hall said that the solicitation will have "objective
     requirements and the relative value the government places on
     them".      Contractors will not be told precisely how to meet those
     requirements but only the performance objectives. `Phase C'
     will be separated into a satellite segment and an integration
     and ground segment. "We have some vendors that are bidding
     on all segments so theoretically a single contractor could win
     it all," said Hall. A final contract award is expected late next
     year with the first satellite system due to be flying early in the
     next decade.      Hall also said that smaller satellites will be considered in the
     FIA as well as other constellations. Although they present
     some technical challenges, constellations of smaller satellites
     mean that more satellites will be on orbit, leading to more
     frequent `revisits' over targets and less overall system
     degradation if one satellite fails.      The FIA programme has already led to some innovation. The
     small Surveillance, Targeting and Reconnaissance Satellite
     (Starlite) being proposed by the Defense Advanced Research
     Projects Agency (DARPA) for tactical reconnaissance could
     be considered as a future imagery architecture option.
     However, it appears more likely it will become a technology
     demonstration.      DARPA's proposal underscores the dilemma of how to draw
     a distinction between reconnaissance - an NRO mission - and
     surveillance, which traditionally has been done by the US Air
     Force in monitoring weather and missile launches for
     example. "We will do more joint programmes with multiple
     sensors," predicted Maj Gen Robert Dickman, the DoD space
     architect.      As the NRO and DoD grow closer, Hall believes it is
     important to acknowledge that commercial systems can only
     go so far in meeting the precise resolution and product
     delivery requirements needed by the IC.      Aside from fielding the FIA, Hall has set a number of other

Fourteen Ways of Looking at a Blackshirt
Umberto Eco, New York Review of Books, excerpted with permission in the Utne Reader, Nov./Dec. 1995, no. 72, pps. 57-59
In spite of some fuzziness regarding the difference between various historical forms of fascism, I think it is possible to outline a list of features that are typical of what I wold like to call Ur-Fascism, or eternal Fascism. These features cannot be organized into a system; many of them contradict each other, and are also typical of other kinds of despotism or fanaticism. But it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it.
The first feature of Ur-Fascism is the *cult of tradition*. Traditionalism is of course much older than fascism. Not only was it typical of counterrevolutionary Catholic thought after the French revolution, but it was born in the late Hellenistic era, as a reaction to classical Greek rationalism. In the Mediterranean basin, people of different religions (most of the faiths indulgently accepted by the Roman pantheon) started dreaming of a reelation received at the dawn of human history. This reelation, according to the traditionalist mystique, had remained for a long time concealed under the veil of forgotten languages -- in Egyptian hieroglyphs, in the Celtic runes, in the scrolls of the little-known religions of Asia.
This new culture had to be *syncretistic*. Syncreticism is not only , as the dictionary says, "the combination of different forms of belief or practice"; such a combination must tolerate contradictions. Each of the original messages contains a sliver of wisdom, and although they seem to say different or incompatible things, they all are nevertheless alluding, allegorically, to the same primeval truth.
As a consequence, there can be no advancement of learning. Truth already has been spelled out once and for all, and we can only keep interpreting its obscure message.
If you browse in the shelves that, in American bookstores, are labeled New Age, you can find there even Saint Augustine, who, as far as I know, was not a fascist. But combining Saint Augustine and Stonehenge -- that is a symptom of Ur-Fascism.
Traditionalism implies the *rejection of modernism*. Both Fascist and Nazis worshiped technology, while traditionalist thinkers usually reject it as a negation of traditional spiritual values. However, even though Nazism was proud of its industrial achievements, its praise of modernism was only the surface of an ideology based upon blood and earth (*Blut und Boden*). The rejection of the modern world was disguised as a rebuttal of the capitalistic way of life. The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as *irrationalism*.
3. Irrationalism also depends on the cult of *action for action's sake*. Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation. Therefore culture is suspect insofar as it is identified with critical attitudes. Distrust of the intellectual world has always been a symptom of Ur_Fascism, from Hermann Goering's fondness for a phrase from a Hanns Johst play ("When I hear the word 'culture' I reach for my gun") to the frequent use of such expressions as "degenerate intellectuals," "eggheads," "effete snobs," and "universities are nests of reds."  The official Fascist intellectuals were mainly engaged in attacking modern culture and the liberal intelligensia for having betrayed traditional values.
4. The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge. for Ur-Fascism, *disagreement is treason*. Besides, disagreement is a sign of diversity. Ur-Fascism grows up and seeks consensus by exploiting and exacerbating the natural *fear of difference*. The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.
Ur-Fascism derives from individual or social frustration. that is why one of the most typical features of this historical fascism was the *appeal to a frustrated middle class*, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups. In our time, when the old "proletarians" are becoming petty bourgeois (and the lumpen are largely excluded from the political scene), the fascism of tomorrow will find its audience in this new majority.
7. To people who feel deprived of a clear social identity, Ur-Fascism says that their only privilege is the most common one, to be born in the same country. This is the origin of nationalism. Besides, the only ones who can provide an identity to the nation are its enemies. Thus at the root of the Ur_fascist psychology there is the *obsession with a plot*, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is to appeal to xenophobia. But the plot must come from he inside. Jews are usually the best target because they have the advantage of being at the same time inside and outside. In the United States, a prominent instance of the plot obsession is to be found in Pat Robertson's *The New World Order*, but, as we have recently seen, there are many others.
The followers must feel *humiliated by the ostentatious wealth and force of their enemies*. When I was a boy I was taught to think of Englishmen as the five-meal people. They ate more frequently than the poor but sober Italians. Jews are rich and help each other through a secret web of mutual assistance. However, the followers of Ur_Fascism must also be convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies. Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak. Fascist governments are condemned to lose wars because they are constitutionally incapable of objectively evaluating the force of the enemy.
For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle. Thus *pacifism is trafficking with the enemy*. This is bad because *life is permanent warfare*. This, however, brings about an Armageddon complex. Since enemies have to be defeated, there must be a final battle, after which the movement will have control of the world. But such a "final solution" implies a further era of peace, a Golden Age, which contradicts the principle of permanent war. No fascist leader has ever succeeded in solving this predicament.
Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology, insofar as it is fundamentally aristocratic, and aristocratic and militaristic elitism cruelly implies *contempt for the weak*. Ur-Fascism can only advocate a popular elitism. Every citizen belongs to the best people of the world, the member of the party are the best among the citizens, every citizen can (or ought to) become a member of the party. But there cannot be patricians without plebeians. In fact, the Leader, knowing that his power was not delegated to him democratically but was conquered by force, also knows that his force is based upon the weakness of the masses; they are so weak as to need and deserve a In such a perspective *everybody is educated to become a hero*. In every mythology the hero is an exceptional being, but in Ur-Fascist ideology heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death. It is not by chance that a motto of the Spanish Falangist was *Viva la Muerte* ("Long Live Death!"). In nonfascist societies, the lay public is told that death is unpleasant but must be faced with dignity; believers are told that it is the painful way to reach a supernatural happiness. By contrast, the Ur-Fascist hero craves heroic death, advertised as the best reward for a heroic life. The Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death.
Since both permanent war and heroism are difficult games to play, *the Ur-Fascist transfers his will to power to sexual matters*. This is the origin of machismo (which implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality). Since even sex is a difficult game to play, the Ur_Fascist hero tends to play with the weapons -- doing so becomes an ersatz phallic exercise.
Ur-Fascism is based upon a *selective populism*, a qualitative populism, one might say.  In a democracy, the citizens have individual rights, but the citizens in their entirety have a political impact only from a quantitative point of view -- one follows the decisions of the majority.  For Ur-Fascism, however, the individuals as individuals have no rights, and the People is conceived as a quality, a monolithic entity expressing the Common will. Since no large quantity of human beings can have a common will, the Leader pretends to be their interpreter. Having lost their power of delegation, citizens do not act; they are only called on to play the role of the People. Thus the People is only a theatrical fiction. there is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional responses of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the Because of its qualitative populism, Ur-Fascism must be *against "rotten" parliamentary governments*.  Wherever a politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of a parliament because it no longer represents the Voice of the People, we can smell Ur-Fascism.
*Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak*. Newspeak was invented by Orwell, in _1984_, as the official language of what he called Insoc, English Socialism. But elements of Ur-Fascism are common to different forms of dictatorship. All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning. But we must be ready to identify other kinds of Newspeak, even if they take the apparently innocent form of a popular talk show.
Ur-Fascism is still around us, sometimes in plainclothes. It would be so much easier for us if there appeared on the world scene somebody saying, "I want to reopen Auschwitz, I want the blackshirts to parade again in the Italian squares." Life is not that simple. Ur-Fascism can come back under the most innocent of disguises. Our duty is to uncover it and to point our finger at any of its new instances -- ever day, in every part of the world. Franklin Roosevelt's words on November 4, 1938, are worth recalling: "If American democracy ceases to move forward as a living force, seeking day and night by peaceful means to better the lot of our citizens, facism will grow in strength in our land." Freedom and liberation are an unending task.

cryptographers and ex-spooks who once looked to
the USG for secure careers, and who also pay top dollar
for premium products and skills once affordable only by the military.
He wonders how governments can compete with these

new global arrangements.

The revenue agents padlocked all three Kids Avenue clothing   stores in Colorado Springs, and posted notices that some customers interpreted as evidence that the woman, Carole Ward, 49, was a drug smuggler.
In a harshly worded 17-page opinion, Judge William Downes of the U.S. District Court in Denver found that one of the IRS agents, James Dolan, was "grossly negligent" and acted with "reckless disregard" for the law, and that he made three false statements in a sworn declaration.

                           Briefer:  Nicholas Burns
QUESTION:  What is the State Department's reaction to the decision of
the German Interior Ministers to put the Church of Scientology under
nationwide observation by the anti-extremist watchdogs?
MR. BURNS:  Well, we understand that the German state and federal
interior ministers have agreed to pursue the recommendations of an
experts group which called for the collection of information on
Scientologists and scientology.  It is our understanding - and we have a
very incomplete understanding, actually, of this decision - that the
ministers directed state and federal law enforcement agencies to develop
a plan to implement these recommendations.
We will examine the details of this decision carefully, but since I
don't believe our embassy in Bonn or our German experts here at the
State Department have had sufficient time really to look at this in
detail, I don't think it's appropriate for me to give you a detailed
comment.  I will say this.  The United States obviously has to stand for
freedom of religion.  We have that in our own country and we stand for
freedom of religion around the world.  If you would just look at our
annual human rights reports, I think four out of the last five years or
five of the last six - I forget which - we have mentioned this issue of
But I feel compelled to say something else about this issue, and that is
that Germany needs to be protected, the German Government and the German
leadership need to be protected from this wild charge made by the Church
of Scientology in the United States that somehow the treatment of
Scientologists in Germany can or should be compared to the treatment of
Jews who had to live, and who ultimately perished, under Nazi rule in
the 1930s.
This wildly inaccurate comparison is most unfair to Chancellor Kohl and
to his government and to regional governments and city governments
throughout Germany.  It has been made consistently by supporters of
scientology here in the United States, and by Scientologists themselves.
I do want to disassociate the United States Government from this
campaign.  We reject this campaign.  It is most unfair to Germany and to
Germans in general.
QUESTION:  Anything in this latest effort by Germany to deal with the
Church of Scientology that concerns you?
MR. BURNS:  Well, Carol, as I said, we have a sketchy understanding, at
best, of what this means.  It appears to be instructions by state and
federal law enforcement agencies to look at a set of recommendations and
develop a plan upon recommendations.
We have an alliance relationship with Germany.  We have a very close
relationship. I think among friends, you don't shoot first and ask
questions later.  What we need to do is study this issue, talk to the
German Government about it, and then perhaps we will have something to
say later on.  But I think it would be most unfair to Germany for us to
have detailed comments when we don't have a detailed understanding of
what this process may or may not be.  Yes.

    We offer these additional views not to foment dissent but
to encourage dialogue with the Administration on the issues
related to encryption. We would like to work with federal law
enforcement and national security agencies to address their
    We sympathize with the difficulties faced by investigative
and security agencies in combating crime, terrorism, and
espionage. We believe it is quite legitimate for the
Administration to be concerned about the uncertain impact that
strong and ubiquitous encryption products may have on law
enforcement and national security agencies. We realize that it
may ultimately become impossible for government agencies to
decipher intercepted or retrieved data and communications that
have, by encryption, been transformed into a seemingly
unintelligible form.
    We recognize the days of cracking strong codes are nearly
gone. Unbreakable codes (256-bit key algorithms can generate
more possible solutions than there are particles in the known
universe) are already widely known. Private security experts
and sophisticated hackers have already realized this and are
beginning to develop ways of attacking the vulnerable points
before and after the information is encrypted (i.e., on the
sender's hard drive or at a ``good-guy'' recipient such as a
bank). We suspect that law enforcement and national security
experts within the government are acquiring similar
capabilities. But these alternative (and more subtle)
approaches are not reflected in the Administration's current
public policy toward encryption.
    The Administration's current encryption policy, a policy
that runs back at least to the Bush Administration, creates
more problems than it resolves. The policy is a combination of
encryption export controls and a key escrow system by which the
key to the code encrypting the information is to be held by a
third party (so it may be made available to the government).
    We need to be honest about this situation. We don't expect
most narcotics traffickers, terrorists, or criminals to respect
export restrictions on encryption when they don't respect our
underlying drugs or weapons laws. And we don't generally expect
anyone who employs encryption in furtherance of a crime to
readily give their keys to some third party so they may be made
available to the government.
    The Administration maintains that there is a commercial
need for key recovery. While that may be true to some extent,
there appears to be little or no demand for the all-
encompassing system they want to mandate. Experts have
uniformly concluded the government's proposed system is either
excessively costly and complex or insecure. In part, this is
true because the government seeks access to real-time
communications and data transmissions, rather than the ability
to recover stored data.
    The Administration insists it doesn't want domestic
restrictions on encryption. We are concerned, however, that the
Administration policy does have this effect. Development of
software programs, including those utilizing encryption, occurs
at an amazingly rapid pace, so it is not feasible for computer
software and hardware companies to develop separate products
for export and for domestic use. As a result, as a practical
matter, only products that are exportable, with weaker
encryption or with government-approved key recovery-escrow, can
be marketed at present.
    We fear that current encryption policy, encouraging as it
does weaker encryption, makes every American more vulnerable to
illicit or surreptitious access to our computer files, our
phone conversations, and personal information, and thus exposes
our citizens to hackers, terrorists, and thieves. It is ironic
that what is trumpeted as an aid to law enforcement may
instead compromise individual and corporate security.
    What we have here is not only a combination of export
controls and a key recovery system that does not work, we have
a system that compromises the competitiveness and security of
this nation's software and hardware industry, as well as our
privacy rights. As conceded by Administration witnesses, the
proposed key recovery system can succeed only as long as there
is no non-conforming encryption software readily available in
the market. But there is already an abundance of such software,
some of it freeware, that is readily available over the
    The proposed key recovery system can not work unless the
United States persuades every other nation to adopt key
recovery. We can safely say we are unlikely to obtain the
agreement of Libya, Iran, Iraq, or North Korea. In addition,
the efforts to date of David Aaron, U.S. Ambassador to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),
to obtain a consensus in support of key recovery resulted
instead in a consensus opposing it.
    The Administration's policy has therefore been a strong
market incentive:
          (a) for non-participants (in the Administration's key
        escrow program) to make non-standard, secure encryption
        available, and
          (b) for U.S. companies to set up abroad in
        "encryption havens'' so they may legally market
        strong, secure encryption products to customers who
        decline to make their "international key'' available
        to diverse governments around the world.
There are already U.S. companies establishing ties with foreign
companies in Japan, Russia, and elsewhere.
    Nor is this policy without its cost. It is estimated that,
if the U.S. persists in its current policy through the year
2000, we shall lose 200,000 jobs and $60 billion each year.
This is what it will cost this nation to lose the cryptography
lead we enjoy and the competitive expertise necessary to
maintain our market position.
    Unfortunately, our discussions to date with law enforcement
and intelligence agencies have not admitted of the possibility
of any further relaxation of export restrictions as part of the
broader process essential to resolving this complex question.
Nor has the Administration offered to consider alternatives to
its key escrow or key recovery system.
    H.R. 695 need not be the end of the process but the
beginning of a real dialogue. This is what we would like to
happen. We continue to remain hopeful that the Administration
will acknowledge the shortcomings of its current policy and
sincerely hope that this will happen soon lest more serious
damage be done to our industry, to our security and to our

     Unleashing Microbots on Iran's IT Networks
     Unlike the 1990-1991 Gulf War, when the USA inserted a      National Security Agency-developed, virus-laden microchip      into a French computer printer headed for Baghdad, in 2015      the USA relies on several methods for infecting Iranian
     computers. These efforts hope to get around problems
     created by the proliferation of encryption technology.      While some peripheral equipment, like printers, will be
     intercepted and bugged in order to disable mainframe
     computers, intelligence technicians will also use the internet
     to send guided viruses into Iran's national information
     infrastructure.      Thumbnail-sized micro-robots, known as `microbots', will
     also be unleashed by micro-air vehicles and naval guns. These
     parasites will creep into electronic equipment, attach
     themselves, and keep themselves alive by draining generator
     power.      Once the electronics system's energy is depleted, the fully
     charged microscopic vermin will search for a new victim.      The main problem will be that they are too small to carry
     identification equipment and so they infect indiscriminately.
     As such, they must be deployed far away from allied
     equipment.      However, packages of microbots can be destroyed remotely
     as allies prepare to invade enemy territory.      <>      [Copyright 1997, Jane's Information Group]

His long imprisonment by the North Vietnamese due to a refusal to be released as the well-known son of a prominent admiral was cited as an example of his duty to to put national interests above his own.
This iconic treatment of a national hero is worth pondering
for the way it reveals what Tim calls "the fix is in."
The imposition of protective measures often occurs through
those with impeccable credentials, especially by appealing to the ones who believe that their special role is to rise above ordinary struggles and dispense exceptional wisdom, fairness and
The question on McCain is: has he been sold on the threat to national security of cryptography by appealing to his deep patriotism, his belief in a special duty to protect the nation, to fight its "war" with the day's enemies.
Such feeding of grandiloquence is historical practice of the
Richlieus running the government, raiding the till, commanding the academies, distributing authorizations to placate antsy The cariacature of this are "banana republics" where
military and political saviors justify coups in the name
of the "public interest," or "the people," fairly well in accord
with threats to authority.
Military, naval and governmental academies worldwide teach this
belief in the special duty of public servants, notwithstanding the
evidence that some graduates reap the not-so-public rewards.
As amply displayed in S.936, the National Defense Authorization
Act for FY 1998, the perennial US banana republic raid on
the till. Read it to see who McCain thinks are the nation's enemies and protectors and who are the supreme judges of both.
What's not as well publicized about leadership academies of all
kinds is that they also teach (and practice) the Machiavellian wisdom of most stringent laws and harshest enforcement for challenges to the authority to govern, to tax, to command, to rule. To assure "national security" for those who thrive on it.

     New twist/ Feds Recant on Mitnick's Fugitive Status      Back in 1994, a supposedly fleeing Kevin Mitnick told anyone      who would listen he really wasn't a fugitive from justice.      He claimed to be just a paranoid hacker who didn't want to      stick around once his probation was up. As it turns out, he      may have been telling me the truth. In a federal court in Los      Angeles, the government admitted it had made a mistake in saying      that Mitnick was on the lam.      The admission may put an entirely different twist on the case.
     If Mitnick wasn't really a fugitive, a couple of probation
     violations mistakenly escalated into one the biggest manhunts
     in cyberspace. Petty offenses by Mitnick -- probably
     punishable by an extension of his probation -- spun into a

     A Canadian company claims it has a unique product that can      spur acceptance of biometric encryption.      The Touchstone device, from Mytec Technologies Inc. of
     Toronto, includes a patented technology called Bioscrypt-a
     coded key or personal identification number that can be
     decoded only when the user's finger slides across a scanner.      Mytec says it adds a layer of security to the fingerprint
     scanning methods typical at other vendors.      "What we do is slide a finger across a scanner, which takes
     the information in the finger pattern and allows it to
     descramble the encrypted key," said George Tomko,
     chairman and co-founder of Mytec.      The finger itself becomes essentially an encryption key and
     can be used in place of a personal identification number at a
     keyboard, automated teller machine, telephone, or to scramble
     data over the Internet.      "With this kind of technology, everyone's finger is a potential

At the FC'97 rump session, Paul Syverson from NRL presented a paper titled "Onion Routing". The description of the system sounds very much like Wei Dai's PipeNet. However, the development team seems to be unaware of PipeNet
and the discussions about it that we had in the past.
NLR has currently five machines implementing the protocol. Connection setup time is claimed to be 500 ms. They are looking for volunteers to run "Onion Routers". It appears the US military wants to access websites without giving away the fact that they are accessing the sites and is looking to us to provide the cover traffic. What a fortunate situation.

We've received from Anonymous a copy of a February 28, 1997, complaint against NSA by an ex-Sandia cryptographer:

The cryptographer, William Payne, was:
   project leader for the Missile Secure Cryptographic Unit    [MSCU] at Sandia between about 1982 and 1986.  The    MSCU was funded by NSA.  Payne designed and built    the hardware/software data authenticator for the US/USSR    Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for Sandia between    1986 and 1992. Payne held SECRET clearance when    Payne worked for the Navy, DOE Q clearance, crypto and    SCI access while at Sandia.
The document says that Payne was a source for the Baltimore Sun story on NSA's "spiking" deal with CryptoAG*, and other stories, after he was fired in 1992 for attacking the quality of NSA's cryptography.

@_subject: US Spies Vacuum Germany 
This week's Spiegel has a three-page follow-up article on the CIA spy:
Der Spiegel No. 12 / 1997, pp. 34-36.
Espionage / "Dinner for Two"
  For almost three years, a CIA agent has pumped a Head of Unit in
  Bonn's Economy Ministry.  The US agencies' wild actions no longer
  are taboo.
The official Klaus Dieter von Horn, 60, ex officio is on the guard of
spies - the Superior Counsellor in the Economy Ministry is responsible
for the Arabian area.  As the head of unit VB7 - that concentrates on
Iran - knows, spies from the Near East, but also from other areas,
take a keen interest in the files on his desk.
Nevertheless, at first the official did not pay much attention to
Geoffry Plant's efforts.  After all, he was in diplomatic duty of the
big brother USA.  Horn and Plant got to know each other late in 1994,
and the American invited the German to a dinner for two every three or
four weeks.  The US embassy's IInd Secretary liked to chat about his
employer and kept asking even more questions about Horn's ministry.
He had Horn explain the political background of the Mykonos lawsuit,
and was interested in the Hermes credits to Iran.  When Bonn in August
1995 asked Iran to send two employees of their office in Bonn on
vacation without return tickets because they had been unveiled as
spies, Plant wanted to know all details.
Another time, he politely asked for a list of those firms that deliver
all sorts of goods, especially high tech, to the Mullahs' state.  The
Ministerial Counsellor remained courteous, but refused: He was not
allowed to hand over those papers, Plant surely knew that?  The
American did understand, but he would not give up.
Last year in May, he again invited Horn to dinner.  He was leaving the
embassy, he said, and on farewell still handed over a Montblanc pen of
almost 300 DM worth.  Also, he introduced his successor: Peyton K
Humphries, a diplomat working on Iran.  Plant asked him not to forget
that name.
That was for granted.  Other authorities were already awaiting the US
embassy's new second secretary with large interest: The German
intelligence agencies wanted to check if the Americans were willing to
continue the agents game in diplomatic undercover.
Because already in Summer 1995, after the first talks with Plant, wary
Horn had contacted the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) and the Bundesamt
f�r Verfassungsschutz (BfV).  Obviously, he reported, American spies
were assigned to him.
He correctly informed the BfV about the various meetings and also
handed over presents such as pens and champagne.  Then, as Humphries
queried him about the ongoing construction of the nuclear power plant
of Busher after his return from a trip to Teheran, Horn described the
US interest in full detail.
What was happening there, was a textbook case to the BfV agent
hunters: Spies from a foreign power wanted to recruit a German top
official.  It is the spy school's ABC to first give the source test
orders such as obtaining material from an open source - as in Horn's
case.  Also typical: The German was supposed not to talk to anyone
about the encounters, including US embassy staff.  Humphries: "There
are two competing camps."  The CIA and the embassy's economy department
don't get on well with each other.
After the German counterespionage experts had dropped all plans to
crack the US embassy that lies at the Rhine like a fortress at
Deichmanns Aue 29, or to tap Humphries' telephone, in this February
BfV head Peter Frisch talked to the head of the CIA in Bonn, Floyd L
Paseman.  Humphries, Frisch demanded, was to leave the country, the
Chancellor's Office and the Foreign Office were annoyed.
Paseman denied espionage, but assured that the CIA agent would leave
until May 30.  He insistently asked to handle the incident most
It failed.  Since Der Spiegel reported first details about the
snooping last week, the relations between the goverment and Washington
are not free from irritations.
In the US, comparisons were made with France kicking out four CIA
agents in 1995.  "Why do the United States spy out their friends?"
the Wall Street Journal asked.  "Shame", said the Chicago Tribune's
editorial.  Washington still treated Germany as an agents center like
"in the age of Cold War".
The timid in Bonn now are afraid of trouble with the big brother.  But
there also is relief.  Kicking the CIA man out gives the chance to no
longer treat espionage among friends as a taboo.
Six and a half years after re-unification and the end of the allied
forces' privileges in Germany, the Germans in the conspirative area
still are not the masters of their own house.  Still, some Western
agencies - the Americans at the head - act like in their own backyard.
Hortensie I, the BND's synonym for the CIA, and Hortensie III, as the
most sinister American intelligence agency, the National Security
Agency (NSA) is referred to, resemble the flower of the same name: a
shrublike plant with strong roots.
The "friendly agencies" are increasingly active in the capital,
Berlin's Secretary of State of the Interior Kuno B�se (CDU) reported
in February.  In mid-February, the heads of the Offices for the
Protection of the Constitution met in Bad Neuenahr to "re-structure
counter-intelligence".  "Focussing on the East", they noted as item 4,
"would not correspond to political reality any more".
Looking to the West shows surprising activity: More than 1,000 wiretap
technicians and 100 professional US agents bustle about in Germany,
security experts estimate.  20 intelligence officers are suspected in
the American embassy at the Rhine alone.
The friendly power's spies are in consulates, allied supreme command,
and barracks.  They try to recruit agents in Germany, they tap sources
without consultation, and whoever uses a telephone between the Alps
and the Baltic Sea must be aware that the NSA be switched in -
attention, the friend is listening.
Before 1990, the American eavesdroppers were ubiquitious.  They
maintained a listening post on the mountain Teufelsberg in Berlin, to
listen to East Berlin, and probably the West as well.  In Frankfort am
Main, close to the Zeil, there was another impressive listening post.
In the Lech plain near Gablingen, the Americans constructed a powerful
circular antenna grid - some 300 meters of diameter and 100 meters of
heigth.  Upside, they were listening on short wave to the Eastern
generals' orders.  What they were doing in the underground, has
remained their secret.
The Teufelsberg has been left, as the Americans moved further to the
East.  The Frankfort subsidiary has also been closed, and Gablingen
will be given up next year.
But the Americans' pride, their "giant ear" in Germany, will remain,
and it makes the ordinary wiretap look rather ordinary.  The site is
located in Bad Aibling, Upper Bavaria.  In an idyllic landscape, the
empire of Hortesie III extends immensely.  Gigantic antenna facilities
that in their covers rise above the plain like huge gulf balls are
eavesdropping Russian military.  Russian sattelites are tapped, the
telephone traffic directed to the formerly Soviet army is recorded.
Right next to it, in the German Mangfall barrack, resides the BND's
so-called long distance radio traffic site.  It (object "Orion") may
use the American antennae, nearly 100 eavesdroppers are analyzing the
cyrillic babel of speech.
But the peace is deceptive.  The intelligence empire NSA (estimated
budget: 3.5 billion dollar, about 100,000 employees) maintains a large
complex in Bad Aibling that is terra incognita to the German agencies.
By far, it is not just about the legitimate American safety interests.
In the midst of Germany, there is a control center for the many
American espionage sattelites that, according to a security expert in
Bonn, "long since do not only spy out the East".  The celestial bodies
of American origin circulating in close orbit suck in electronic
signals above Germany like a huge vacuum cleaner.  With encrypted
signals, Bad Aibling queries the memory of the satellites and searches
the collected phone conversations, faxes and computer traffic for
interesting stuff.
Until 1995 the site officially used the name of the NSA.  To keep up
appearances, then a US Air Force lieutenant colonel took over command,
the military flag is demonstratively fluttering in the wind.  But
still more than 1,000 eavesdroppers are working in the huge complex,
according to BND estimates.  Estimated 150 of them are directly from
the NSA that does the controlling and sets the tasks.
In spite of many inquiries, Hortensie III has strictly denied to
exchange all information from "non-military intelligence".  The BND,
they argue, can offer nothing of comparable value.
But it probably is more about not telling the Germans what they really
do.  If American and German security experts are right, European
companies are systematically spied out from Bad Aibling.
Years ago, US president Bill Clinton decreed American agencies to
larger commitment in economic espionage.  When the European airplane
giant Airbus Industries, of which Germany holds 37.9%, was competing
for a large Saudi Arabian contract with two US groups, the NSA
intervened.  It intercepted all faxes and phone conversations between
Airbus and the Saudis.  So, the Americans knew their opponent and
their offers were unbeatable - after all the orders valued at six
billion dollars.
While the British and French to a certain extend respect Germany's
souvereignty, the Americans, who had brought up the BND, behave like a
victor power.  They insist on supplementary agreements on intelligence
cooperation with "the allied forces".  Thus, the Germans must respect
"necessities of military safety" of Nato contingents here.  There is
much room for secretive manners in German territory.
In its "Westport" office in the East of Munich, the CIA until now
maintains a so-called inquiry office.  The Americans ask
asylum-seeking refugees and emigrants from whom they expect
informaition to come to Munich from all Germany.  Pro forma, the BND
is asked for endorsement, but the talks usually take place without
German participation, and the BND does not learn about possible CIA
The Americans are questioning deserted Russian soldiers, war refugees
from former Yugoslavia, and asylum-seekers from the Near East.  The
VIPs of them are offered asylum in the USA.  Even applicants from
overseas are brought to the experts in Munich for interrogation.
For a long time, German politics have ignored the activities of the
rogue agency.  In autumn 1994, the Chancellor's Office installed a
working group, strictly confidential of course, to get the American
and other friendly agencies under control.
Three ministries and three intelligence agencies were sitting at the
table, headed by Rudolf Dolzer, professor of international law, at
that time Head of Unit in the Chancellor's Office.  "What they are
doing here is not possible", Dolzer got exited.  "They must comply
with law and oder."
The group boldly planned to prohibit the Americans from interrogating
asylum-seekers without German participation, in Bad Aibling BND
specialists should watch the NSA, recruiting sources should be
prohibited.  After all - they concluded - espionage activities also
from friendly states are not politically protected.
In 1995, their will of protection suddenly vanished.  Distances
between meetings grew longer, finally the Chancellor's Office didn't
send out invitations any more.  Above all, the BfV that already had
created lists with names of suspicious agents was disappointed.
"Someone on the very top must have pulled the plug", someone from an
intelligence agency says.
It is dubious if the case of CIA agent Humphries will cause with the
Americans to change their policy.  At least, friendship with America
means a big deal to Helmut Kohl who does not consider the intelligence
business especially important.
The Chancellor is not even scared by the sinister NSA.  He does have
telephones that are guaranteed to be wiretap-proof.  Even when he is
on vacation at the Wolfgangsee [in Austria], the BND always installs a
device which not even the NSA can crack.  But the secure devices have
one important drawback: First the partner has to stop speaking before
you can speak yourself.
That is why the Chancellor to the displeasure of the security people
prefers the old telephone - a friend trusts a friend.

For details of the crack see the cryptographers' press release at:    The New York Times, March 20, 1997, pp. A1, D2.
Code Set Up to Shield Privacy Of Cellular Calls Is Breached
By John Markoff
San Francisco, March 19 -- A team of well-known computer
security experts will announce on Thursday that they have
cracked a key part of the electronic code meant to protect the
privacy of calls made with the new, digital generation of
cellular telephones.
The announcement, intended as a public warning, means that --
despite their greater potential for privacy protection -- the
new cellular telephones, which transmit streams of digital
information in code similar to computer data, may in practice
be little more secure from eavesdropping than the analog
cellular phones, which send voice as electronic patterns
mimicking sound waves, that have been in use the last 15
It was such eavesdropping, for example, that caused trouble
for Newt Gingrich when a Florida couple listened to his
cellular phone conversation in December about the
Congressional ethics inquiry.
Now that digital wireless networks are coming into use around
the nation, the breaking of the digital code by the team of
two computer security consultants and a university researcher
confirms fears about privacy that were raised five years ago
when the communications industry agreed under Government
pressure to adopt a watered-down privacy technology.
Several telecommunications industry officials said the
pressure came from the National Security Agency, which feared
that stronger encryption technology might allow criminals or
terrorists to conspire with impunity by cellular phones.
But independent security experts now say that the code is easy
enough to crack that anyone with sufficient technical skills
could make and sell a monitoring device that would be as easy
to use as a police scanner is.
Such a device would enable a listener to scan hundreds of
wireless channels to listen in randomly on any digital call
within a radius ranging from 1,000 feet to a number of miles.
Or, as with current cellular technology, if a specific person
was the target of an eavesdropper, the device could be
programmed to listen for any nearby digital call to that
person's telephone number.
Other possible transgressions would include using the device
to automatically harvest all calling card or credit-card data
transmitted with nearby digital wireless phones.
And, because of a loophole in the Communications Act of 1934,
making and selling such devices would not be illegal, though
actually using one would technically be against the law.
These monitoring devices are not yet available, but security
experts said that a thriving gray market was certain to
develop. And with technical details of the security system
already circulating on the Internet instructions for cracking
it will almost certainly make their way into the computer
underground, where code breaking and eavesdropping are pursued
for fun and profit.
Technical details of the security system were supposed to be
a closely guarded secret, known only to a tight circle of
industry engineers. But the researchers performed their work
based on technical documents that were leaked from within the
communications industry and disseminated over the Internet
late last year.
"The industry design process is at fault," said David Wagner,
a University of California at Berkeley researcher who was a
member of the team that broke the code. "We can use this as a
lesson, and save ourselves from more serious vulnerabilities
in the future."
Communications industry technical experts, made aware of the
security flaw earlier this year, have been meeting to
determine whether it is too late to improve the system's
privacy protections. Already the digital technology is in use
in metropolitan areas, including New York and Washington,
where either the local cellular networks have been modified to
support digital technology or where new so called wireless
personal communications services are being offered.
"We're already in the process of correcting this flaw," said
Chris Carroll, an engineer at GTE Laboratories, who is
chairman of the industry committee that oversees privacy
standards for cellular phones.
But Greg Rose, a software designer for the Qualcomm Inc. a
leader in digital cellular systems said that fixing the flaw
would be "a nightmare." Tightening the security system, Mr.
Rose said, would involve modifying software already used in
the computerized network switching equipment that routes
wireless digital telephone calls, as well as the software
within individual phones.
Currently, about 45 million Americans have cellular phones,
though most of them so far are based on an older analog
standard that offers no communications privacy. But cellular
companies are gradually converting their networks to the new
digital standard, and the new personal communications services
networks going into operation around the country also employ
the digital encryption system. Nearly a million P.C.S. phones
have been sold in the United States, according to cellular
industry figures.
Besides Mr. Wagner, the other researchers who cracked the code
were Bruce Schneier and John Kelsey of Counterpane Systems, a
Minneapolis consulting firm. Mr. Schneier is the author of a
standard textbook on cryptography.
The new digital wireless security system, which was designed
by cellular telephone industry engineers was never intended to
stop the most determined wiretappers.
But because digital calls are transmitted in a format
corresponding to the one's and zero's of computer language,
they are more difficult to eavesdrop on than conventional
analog calls, which are transmitted in electronic patterns.
And digital calls protected with encryption technology --
basically a mathematical formula in the software that
scrambles the signal -- would be all the harder for a third
party to listen to surreptitiously.
Because the encryption system that the industry adopted in
1992 was deliberately made less secure than many experts had
recommended at the time, privacy rights advocates have been
warning since that the code could be broken too easily. An
announcement Thursday that the code has indeed been cracked
would seem to bear out those concerns.
"This should serve as a wake-up call," said James X. Dempsey,
senior staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a public interest group. "This shows that
Government's effort to control encryption technology is now
hindering the voice communications industry as well as the
data and electronic communication realm."
Industry executives acknowledged that steps must be taken to
address the problem.
"We need strict laws that say it is illegal to manufacture or
to modify a device which is designed to perpetrate the illegal
interception of P.C.S. telephone calls," said Thomas E.
Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telephone Industry
Association, a Washington-based trade group.
Mr. Wheeler said the weaker privacy technology had been
adopted not just to appease the Government but because makers
of wireless communications hardware and software wanted to
embrace a technical standard that would meet export
regulations. Those rules, based on national security
considerations, sharply curtail the potency of American-made
encryption technology.
The three computer researchers who broke the code belong to an
informal group of technologists who believe strongly that
powerful data-scrambling technologies are essential to protect
individual privacy in the information age. These
technologists, who planned to release their findings in a news
release on Thursday, argue that the best way to insure that
the strongest security codes are developed is to conduct the
work in a public forum. And so they are sharply critical of
the current industry standard setting process which has made
a trade secret of the underlying mathematical formulas used to
create the security codes.
"Our work shows clearly why you don't do this behind closed
doors," Mr. Schneier said. "I'm angry at the cell phone
industry because when they changed to the new technology, they
had a chance to protect privacy and they failed."
Mr. Carroll, head of the industry's privacy committee, said it
planned to revise the process for reviewing proposed technical

TITLE:	CTIA: Encryption of Digital Wireless Phones
SOURCE:	PR Newswire
DATE:	3/20/97 12:10 PM
                 CTIA:  Encryption of Digital Wireless Phones
    Today, a group of professional and academic cryptographers will announce
that it has "discovered a flaw in the privacy protection used in today's most
advanced digital cellular phones."  Following is a set of questions and
answers that arise from that announcement.
    Q.  Does this mean that eavesdroppers can listen in on my phone calls?
    A.  No.  The encryption discussed by the researchers involves the
algorithm used to encrypt numbers punched on the keypad of a phone, not the
algorithm used to encrypt voice transmissions.
    Q.  Is it easy to break this keypad number code?
    A.  Not at this time.  It involves very sophisticated cryptological
knowledge.  The digital encryption system now in use is designed to inhibit
interception by the unsophisticated.  Any technology developed by one person
can be broken by another with the application of sufficient technology.  This
announced attack requires multiple minutes -- up to hours -- of high speed
computer processing to break a coded message.
    0.  What is the impact of this announcement on people who now use
wireless phones?
    A.  Virtually none.  Approximately 95 percent of the wireless phones now
being used are analog phones, not digital phones.  The possible impact of this
announcement is only relevant to some digital phones that are now being
introduced to the market.
    Q.  Why didn't the wireless phone industry develop phones that have
unbreakable security?
    A.  Standards for phone technology are developed within the confines of
federal regulations and the realities of the marketplace.  A wireless phone is
a consumer product, not a spy v. spy technology adequate for national
security.  Such a unit would have cost, battery life and call set-up times
which would make it unacceptable to consumers.
    0.  Does this announcement have any impact on the industry's efforts to
stop phone cloning?
    A.  No. During the past year, the industry has been very successful in
introducing new technologies that prevent phone cloning.  These authentication
and "fingerprinting" technologies operate differently and are not compromised
by the cryptography announced today.
    Q.  What is the industry doing about this problem?
    A.  Tom Wheeler, the president and CEO of CTIA, testified before Congress
on February 5, about the need to strengthen the laws protecting the security
of wireless phone calls.  It is currently illegal to intentionally intercept a
wireless phone call.  Unfortunately, whereas federal law prohibits the sale
and manufacture of devices designed to eavesdrop on wireless calls, it does
not extend the prohibition to cordless phones and the newer digital
frequencies.  In regard to today's announcement, Wheeler said, "This is the
horse nudging at the barn door and it is time to act before the horse is gone

@_subject: Schneier Rebuts CTIA 
(Thanks to DAW for the CTIA and Schneier forwards)
Here's Bruce Schneier's press release rebutting the CTIA's assertions.
Forwarded message:
MINNEAPOLIS -- The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA)
issued a press release discussing our recent cryptographic break against
digital cellular phones.  Following is a correction of some of their
1.  While it is true that our paper did not discuss voice encryption, that
does not mean that the voice encryption system is any good.  As early as
1992 others -- including noted expert Whitfield Diffie -- have pointed out
fatal flaws in the new standard's voice privacy features.  The underlying
technology is the Vegienere cipher, broken by the Union Army during the
American Civil War.  One cryptographer was quoted in the July 1992
Communications of the ACM calling the voice privacy protection "pitifully
easy to break."  Certainly digital cellular is harder to eavesdrop on than
analog cellular--the latter just requires a scanner tuned to the correct
frequencies--digital cellular voice security can be broken in real time by
anyone with a little bit of budget, expertise, and desire.
2.  While our break did involve sophisticated cryptographic expertise, our
results have been published.  While we have no intention of publishing our
computer code, anyone able to understand our paper can implement our
attack.  It is not true that "any technology developed by one person can be
broken by another with the application of sufficient technology."  The
Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) could have designed secure
algorithms to protect voice and messages; they chose not to.
3.  While it is true that our announcement does not affect most people
because they use analog phones, that is a misleading statement.  Analog
phones are even less secure; the whole point of digital cellular was that
it was secure.  This announcement affects both CDMA and TDMA cellular
systems, but not GSM systems.
4.  The phone industry did not develop phones with unbreakable security
because they chose not to.  It is possible, with today's technology, to
implement digital cellular algorithms in cellular phones without affecting
the phone's weight, power consumption, voice quality, or call setup.  It
takes more computer processing power to digitize the voice than it does to
encrypt the digital voice.
5.  It is true that our attack does not affect phone cloning.  The TIA put
more effort into preventing cellular fraud, because that directly affects
their bottom line.  Cellular privacy is much less of a concern, so they
didn't bother doing a good job.
6.  All the industry seems to be doing about this problem is releasing
misleading press releases in an attempt to pretend that nothing is wrong.
One moral of this story is that good security standards need to be
developed in the open.  The CTIA believed that keeping the details of their
security measures secret improved the security of the system.  This notion
works, as long as the details remain secret.  All good security systems are
designed to remain secure even if their details are made public.  To do
otherwise is naive and foolish, similar to creating recipes without ever
bothering to let anyone taste the food.
The CTIA also pointed to the need for legislation to make this illegal.
While important, this is not a solution.  Listening in on analog cellular
phones is illegal, but people do it all the time.  Stealing cars is
illegal, but Lojack is still in business.  We need to protect ourselves
with technology, not with legislation.  Laws are a quick fix for an
industry unwilling to devote resources to solving their problems.

The Administration has stated on numerous occasions that we do not support mandatory key escrow and key recovery. Our objective is to enable the development and establishment of a voluntary key management system for public-key based encryption. We believe the Administration's policy is succeeding in bringing key recovery products to the marketplace. Our attention is now turning toward how we can best facilitate the development of the key management infrastructure that will support those products. To that end, we will shortly submit legislation intended to do the following:
  Expressly confirm the freedom of domestic users to choose any   type or strength of encryption.
  Explicitly state that participation in the key management   infrastructure is voluntary.
  Set forth legal conditions for the release of recovery   information to law enforcement officials pursuant to lawful   authority and provides liability protection for key recovery   agents who have properly released such information.
  Criminalizes the misuse of keys and the use of encryption to   further a crime.

There does appear to be a coordinated global action to issue policies on TTP, GAK and the like at this time. OECD is due to shortly release its crypto policy, as is the USG according to BXA.
The FBI issued its wiretap payment plan yesterday. Herson
publically admitted the EU-FBI wiretap pact.
All are apparently guided by The Wassenaar Arrangement amongst
two dozen or so countries to act in concert, and to go public with
dual-use controls in unison.
So, Clint Brooks' comment at CFP about a new policy coming out

guise of TTP or Key Recovery, as was speculated here, and as
Rensch's statement to the House yesterday affirms.
It's a policy sure to appeal to nationalists and chauvinists: strong protection for a nation's interest and commerce with GAK; without
it no protection from predatory (rogue) nations (and criminals). But, as the Crypto AG engineer asked, "Who will protect us from NSA?"
And its predatory clients and contractors, the Germans and French and

   U.S. Rebuffed in Global Proposal For Eavesdropping on the
   Internet    By John Markoff
   In a setback for the Clinton Administration that
   demonstrates the difficulty of setting global policies for
   the Internet, the leading industrial nations have declined
   to embrace a United States proposal to allow computer
   eavesdropping by the world's law enforcement agencies.
   The United States proposal, backed by Britain and France,
   was an attempt to restrict the private use of increasingly
   advanced data-scrambling technology that can protect the
   privacy of electronic mail and other forms of computer
   communication. The equipment can make it difficult for law
   enforcement officials to crack a code when they suspect it
   is masking criminal or terrorist activities.
   The proposal called for international endorsement of a
   system in which mathematical keys to computer-security
   codes would be held by escrow agents from whom law
   enforcement officials could obtain the keys once they have
   a court's wiretapping warrant.
   But policy guidelines scheduled to be released in Paris
   today by the 29-nation Organization for Economic
   Cooperation and Development fail to endorse the United
   States proposal. And they leave such leeway for members to
   regulate data-scrambling technology--or not--that computer
   security experts say any uniform international policy
   remains elusive.
   "The difficulty with the guidelines is that anybody can
   interpret parts of them in their own way," said Konstantine
   Papanikdaw, a policy analyst for information security at
   the European Commission in Brussels.
   Indeed, the industrial world seems to be deeply divided on
   whether governments can ever legitimately eavesdrop on the
   electronic communication of their citizens. Because
   messages on the Internet are easy to intercept, a growing
   number of individuals and corporations are protecting the
   privacy of their communications and the security of their
   commercial transactions by scrambling such information.
   Some O.E.C.D. nations, including Britain and France, have
   either outlawed or are in the process of tightly regulating
   the private use of data-scrambling systems. But other
   nations--including Australia, Canada Denmark and
   Finland--have policies that protect individual privacy.
   Among other member nations, Japan had initially resisted
   the United States proposal but was said to be moving closer
   to it, while Germany remained deeply divided.
   Most other countries, inside or outside the O.E.C.D., have
   yet to confront the data-scrambling issue. And even the
   United States has a somewhat contradictory national policy
   that permits citizens to use whatever data-scrambling
   software they wish within the nation's borders, but
   restricts the export of the most up-to-date computer-coding
   technology.
   That seeming contradiction, however, did not prevent the
   Clinton Administration in recent months from waging a
   vigorous behind-the-scenes effort for its proposal. And
   hoping to resolve some of the policy conflicts, the
   Administration is now circulating draft legislation on
   Capitol Hill which would attempt to control even the
   domestic use of data-scrambling software and establish a
   key-escrow system for the United States.
   While the O.E.C.D. has no authority to set international
   policy, its recommendations are frequently used by member
   nations in setting their own foreign and trade policies.
   And the privacy and law-enforcement aspects of the Internet
   are issues on which member governments have been desperate
   for guidance.
   But even though most of the O.E.C.D. discussions involved
   law enforcement officials, who have been the main advocates
   for measures that would insure their ability to crack
   codes, European officials say that there was never much
   agreement on what to do.
   And so the primary recommendation in the report, a copy of
   which was obtained by The New York Times, simply gives
   O.E.C.D. member nations the latitude to do as they see fit
   when it comes to data scrambling, which is formally known
   as cryptography.
   "National cryptography policies may allow lawful access to
   plain text, or cryptographic keys, or encrypted data," the
   report says.
   Privacy-rights advocates see the O.E.C.D. guidelines as a
   critical setback for the Clinton Administration. "The U.S.
   proposal to endorse lawful access to private keys was
   explicitly rejected by the O.E.C.D. member countries," said
   Marc Rotenberg of the Washington-based Electronic Privacy
   Information Center and a member of the O.E.C.D.'s advisory
   group. "The O.E.C.D. chose instead a policy based on
   voluntary, market-driven development of cryptography
   products."
   And even supporters of the United States position
   acknowledged that guidelines were a disappointment.
   "The United States probably had more success raising
   consciousness then getting language that could he treated
   as an endorsement for key recovery," said Stewart Baker, a
   former National Security Agency official who participated
   on the American delegation to the O.E.C.D.
   Meanwhile, executives for the United States computer
   industry were critical of the O.E.C.D. for even leaving the
   door open for governments to set national policies on data
   scrambling.
   "We think that markets, not governments, should be the
   primary determinants of technology solutions," said Jon
   Englund, a vice president at the Information Technology
   Association of America, a trade group.
   Many experts question whether governments can ever hope to
   insure law enforcement access to electronic messages or to
   restrict the spread of super-strong coding software,
   because new, more powerful versions can always be developed
   and easily transmitted over the Internet in the blink of an
   eye.
   And any international effort is almost certainly doomed if
   some countries refuse to go along with a common approach,
   because people looking for strong encryption can simply
   acquire it wherever the laws are lax. In fact, the big
   German company Siemens A.G. recently introduced an
   encryption system that it advertises as being much more
   powerful than American companies can export under United
   States law.
   Besides the United States, France and Britain both support
   a system for enabling law enforcement officials to obtain
   keys to data-scrambling codes. France has already passed a
   stringent law that requires participation in such a system,
   although the rules to carry out the law have not yet been
   worked out.
   And in recent days, Britain has quietly circulated the most
   restrictive proposal of any nation, a domestic policy under
   which the Government would allow private use only of
   cryptography that was officially licensed, to make sure
   that the software uses code that law enforcement officials
   can crack.
   Under such laws, of course, criminals and terrorists might
   logically choose to use unauthorized encryption software.
   But the mere fact that such use would be a crime may be a
   deterrent--or give the police grounds to arrest anyone
   whose communications were indecipherable.
   In Germany, encryption remains a deeply divisive issue. The
   Interior Ministry has supported the need for encryption
   restrictions of some sort, but the Justice Ministry and the
   Economics Ministry have both signaled their opposition. And
   German businesses have been outspoken opponents against any
   new restrictions on data scrambling.
   Meanwhile, United States export restrictions have been a
   boon for Brokat Informationssysteme G.m.b.H., a
   two-year-old start-up company in Boblingen, Germany. Brokat
   supplies secure electronic transaction software for banks
   like Deutsche Bank and on-line services like America Online
   in Europe.
   One of Brokat's hottest products is the Expresso Security
   Package which essentially adds strong encryption to the
   World Wide Web browsers and Internet server software sold
   by two of the largest American software companies--
   Microsoft and Netscape Communications.

News Release --  March 27, 1997
DIGITAL TORNADO:
THE INTERNET AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY
FCC Staff Working Paper on Internet Policy
     The FCC's Office of Plans and Policy (OPP) today released a staff
working paper analyzing the implications of the Internet for the
FCC and telecommunications policy.  OPP Working Paper No. 29,
"Digital Tornado: The Internet and Telecommunications Policy," was
written by Kevin Werbach, Counsel for New Technology
Policy.  OPP periodically issues working papers on emerging areas in
communications; these papers represent individual views and are not an
official statement by the FCC or any FCC commissioner.
     "Digital Tornado" represents the first comprehensive assessment of
the questions the Internet poses for traditional communications policy.
A central theme running through the paper is that the FCC, and other
government agencies, should seek to limit regulation of Internet
services.  In framing his approach, Werbach states: "Because it is not
tied to traditional models or regulatory environments, the Internet
holds the potential to dramatically change the communications
landscape.  The Internet creates new forms of competition, valuable
services for end users, and benefits to the economy.  Government policy
approaches toward the Internet should therefore start from two premises:
avoid unnecessary regulation, and question the applicability of
traditional rules."
     After providing an analytical framework to understand the forces
driving Internet growth, and describing the Internet's development and
architecture, the paper addresses three primary areas:
     CATEGORY DIFFICULTIES
     Policy and legal questions arising from the fact that Internet-
     based services do not fit easily into the existing classifications
     for communications services under federal law or FCC
     regulations.
     PRICING AND USAGE
     Policy questions arising from the economics of Internet
     access, including assertions by local telephone companies that
     current Internet pricing structures result in network
     congestion, and arguments by Internet service providers that
     telephone companies have not upgraded their networks to
     facilitate efficient transport of data services.
     AVAILABILITY OF BANDWIDTH
     Regulatory and technical issues affecting the deployment of
     technologies promising to enable high-speed Internet access to
     the home and to businesses, including the implications for the
     Internet of the FCC's role in promoting universal service.

   have come up with a new computer encryption formula that
   they say is nearly impossible to crack.
   The International Business Machines Corporation said that
   the breakthrough was still a long way from being employed
   outside the lab and that it did nothing to resolve the
   running dispute between the computer industry and the
   Federal Government over whether law enforcement agencies
   should be given access to encrypted communications. But it
   could ultimately help reduce the vulnerability of so-called
   public-key encryption, which is the favored security method
   used to safeguard commerce and privacy on the Internet.
   "They've made a big advance," said Joan Feigenbaum, a
   researcher at AT&T Labs in Murray Hill, N.J., who is
   familiar with the work of the two computer scientists who
   developed the system, Miklos Ajtai and Cynthia Dwork of
   I.B.M.'s Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif.
   "Scientifically, this is a big step in the right
   direction."
   But Bruce Schneier, a computer security consultant in
   Minneapolis and author of a standard textbook on
   cryptography, dismissed the news.
   "Theoretically it is important, but as a security
   breakthrough there is nothing new," he said.
   In public-key encryption, the sender of an electronic
   communication uses software that automatically scrambles
   the information by incorporating a publicly known numerical
   key. Decoding the scrambled transmission requires a private
   key, a number supposedly known only by the recipient.
   The security of the system depends, among other things, on
   how difficult it is for an electronic eavesdropper to crack
   the code using a powerful computer. If some of the codes
   that are generated by the system are difficult to break but
   others are easy, the system is inherently weak. I.B.M. said
   that its new system was the first to generate hundreds of
   codes at random, each of which is as difficult to crack as
   the hardest instance of the underlying mathematical
   problem.
   The system is based on a problem that has defied solution
   by mathematicians for 150 years, I.B.M. said.
   Mr. Schneier said that the cryptographic formulas now in
   use were already robust enough. The biggest challenge, he
   said, is creating security systems in the real world that
   are not vulnerable to hackers.
   "Cryptography is a lot more than math" he said.

"This is not to imply that any humans at all are necessarily
at increased risk of cancer as a consequence of exposure to RF fields. No single experiment on animals can allow such
a conclusion. Rather, we believe the study reported here
indicates a need for further research. Tumorigenesis in
genetically predisposed mice may provide a useful assay
for interactions between RF fields and biological systems. With the current rapid expansion in the use of RF fields
for telecommunications, a reliable assay is required to
enable a better assessment of limits to safe levels of
human exposure."

   Administration is reevaluating its tactics constantly. This seems to coordinate with Kerrey's initiative to lump
all crypto bills into one "acceptable to the leadership

   BTW, another report claims that proposed new regs will allow banks the special privilege of strong crypto if they come up with an acceptable KMI within two years.

On Tim's war underway:
It is not McVeigh's type of ANFO-munitions that threaten
the legal-financial-governmental interests but the uncontrolled
munitions available to wage war on public policy, commerce, legislation, funding, regulation, intelligence, surveillance and law enforcement.
There has been an astonishing range of such munitions discussed on cypherpunks in the three years I've been around, and there's much more in the archives (handily collated in Tim's Crypto is central, to be sure, but hardly the only munition, as
many often remind.
Indeed, it is noteworthy how many of the broad range of these
potentially destructive munitions are not regulated by the EAR
and other regimes.
As with chemicals, explosives, bio-organisms, mathematics, physics,
it takes highly skilled people to advise the regulators on what
needs control and when, and not just the finished weapon, but its
components and sub-components. (As an example, see ATF's latest list of explosives:  )
The war underway is often waged at secret councils of scientific
information and intelligence used by all government and
military agencies (meetings are listed in the Federal Register,
regularly reported on jya.com).
So it is not the known terrorist-munitions that are worrisome; it's
the ones not yet publicized but known to scientists, warfighters and
keepers of secrets who keep their fingers crossed and plan for
the worst -- say, the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure
Protection ( ).
It would be instructive to post here uncontrolled munitions available for the war underway, with comments on how to elude control of the burgeoning domestic and global regimes.
I'd like to host a running Uncontrolled Munitions List (UML) on jya.com.

"All cryptologists are rightly paranoid, they break the rules of the
game and lie to hide how it's done." -- Anonymous.
For what it's worth, it was Sandia who disclosed Payne's
public key break paper, not him. He's suing SNL for privacy His suit of DoE and NSA is about being fired for refusing to carry out illegal work which craven colleagues jumped to do.
William Payne could be the Bellwether of spilling the dark
national lab secrets unless, ahem, he gets his million
dollar settlement. I say good luck to him and the others
fighting the secret-hoaders.
Payne's dispute with Sandia and NSA shows once again how the
gatekeepers of top secrets manipulate those who work on
classified projects:
Lure the best and brightest with flattering invitations to
join prestigous secret work. Require high-penalty NDAs for participation.
Invite to work on repugnant projects, and if refused, fire
for insubordination or other pretext ("displeasing the
customer" or "to protect national security").
Then, destroy careers by precluding ever again working on
classified projects.
Finally, stigmatize the victim and publicize to frighten
other workers into subservience.
This entrapment into fearful servitude happens repeatedly in
high affairs of state: Oppenheimer, Snepp, McGee, Halperin,
and so on. There are dozens of current pending cases at DoE,
CIA, NSA and the like in the US, and many more in other
To be sure, wisely obedient government workers will never
have to cry "help me, my former colleagues are attacking, I
did nothing wrong."
Still, it seems that there must be ritual sacrifices of the
innocent, as Shirley Jackson wrote in "The Lottery," to
expatiate collective guilt, any innocent will do -- "for all
are equally guilty," so the gods and secret-keepers hyper-
guiltily smirk.
Who's next to exaptiate the guilt of the mega death national
and university labs? Surely not Hallam-Baker or Crisp?
Or, as Tim suggests, how about sacrificing the secret labs (and black-chip fabs)? There's a bill before Congress to
redo the NLs, but why dawdle when there's a surefire

   IRS says suspect discussed sabotage
      An affidavit says a Vancouver man arrested Friday talked of
      sabotaging Portland's 9-1-1 computer and Bull Run water
   By John Painter, Jr., of the Oregonian staff
   Vancouver, Wash. -- A Vancouver man arrested Friday by Internal
   Revenue agents discussed sabotaging the computers in Portland's
   9-1-1 center and talked about using a botulism toxin to contaminate    the Bull Run water supply, a federal agent said Monday.
   James Dalton Bell, 38, appeared Monday afternoon in U.S. District
   Court in Tacoma and was accused in an 18-page affidavit of scheming
   to overthrow the U.S. government.
   U.S. Magistrate J. Kelly Arnold set Friday for a detention and
   preliminary hearing. The government has asked that Bell be held
   without bail because he is a danger to the community.
   Bell, who describes himself as a libertarian, has a history of tax
   disputes with the IRS, which says Bell "has a large, outstanding unpaid
   balance."
   Bell is the author of "Assassination Politics," a 10-part essay about a
   risk-free way of rewarding assassins who successfully kill designated
   public officials. The essay has circulated on the Internet.
   The strategy, which Bell says he wrote and posted for discussion,
   involves uses of encryption to predict and confirm assassinations and
   electronic digital cash to pay for the killings.
   Federal agents raided Bell's Vancouver home April 1.
   He is accused of obstructing government officers and employees and
   using false Social Security numbers. But government agents think he
   is far more dangerous than the charges suggest, the affidavit filed by
   IRS Inspector Phillip G. Scott said.
   Scott's affidavit said Bell, who has a chemistry degree from the
   Massaschusetts Institute of Technology, had discussions about using
   carbon fiber particles to attack computer systems with Greg Daly, a
   friend who is an electronics specialist overseeing Portland's 9-1-1
   communications center.
   "Daly stated that he and Bell had 'laughed' about attacking the 9-1-1
   center with fiber," the affidavit said.
   Daly also told IRS agents that he had hypothetical discussions with
   Bell about contaminating water supplies and about making botulism
   toxin from green beans, the affidavit said.
   In the April 17 and 18 interviews with IRS agents, Daly said that as part
   of his job, he "has keys and direct access to the Portland Bull Run
   water treatment facility."
   Daly said Monday that the conversations that he and Bell had were
   merely "intellectual fun-and-games discussions" between old friends
   who enjoy technical things.
   "There's a difference between reasonable freedom of speech and
   unreasonable probability of attack," Daly said. "Standing around and
   flapping our lips about how it would be funny is way different from
   even contemplating actual attack."
   Daly described his friend of 15 years as a "bit of an odd unit" but never
   dangerous and never serious about attacking the 9-1-1 systems or the
   Bull Run watershed.
   "I'd rat him out in a heartbeat for that," Daly said.
   Thursday, IRS agents searched the home of Robert East, a merchant
   radioman and a friend of Bell's. Among items seized was 3-foot length
   of carbon fiber.
   The affidavit said East told agents that he and Bell had discussed "the
   possibility of putting the fibers down the air vents of a federal building"
   to kill its computers and about using the fiber against the IRS.
   However, Bell has described himself as a "man of ideas, not action,"
   and East said Bell was a "talker, not a doer."

New Cryptanalysis Course Announced by NTI One Day
Course for Corporate, Military and Law Enforcement Computer
Specialists Covers Issues in Cryptography and Cryptanalysis
Gresham, Ore., May 20 -- NTI today announced a one day class which gives corporate, military and law enforcement MIS personnel a
state-of-the-art grounding on the topics of computer
cryptography and cryptanalysis. With materials developed by
Eric Thompson, one of the world leading experts in this field,
attendees will receive instruction in the technological and
procedural elements of cryptanalysis. Unlike other sources of
information on the topic, this presentation covers the analysis
of existing commercial applications and their weaknesses. This course joins NTI's other courses in forensic computer
science. The forensic courses covers state-of-the-art
information regarding computer evidence processing,
evidence preservation and the identification of relevant data. "This class in cryptography grew out of requests for more
information on encryption from our forensics course
attendees. The course is highly focused and is presented with
state-of-the-art materials," stated Michael R. Anderson, the
President and co-founder of NTI, "and it covers material that
has historically not been presented from a practical
perspective. Computer and data security are rapidly becoming
a top priority as organizations become increasingly aware of
their vulnerability to information attack and encryption is a
vital part of reducing that vulnerability." Topics covered in the NTI cryptography course include:   Cryptographic terms and lexicon   Basics of crypto system design   Isolating cryptographic weakness in commercial systems   Cryptography in electronic commerce   Cryptography in Internet security applications   International issues in cryptography and secure applications   The Future of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis "Eric Thompson, our senior cryptographer, developed the
materials used in the presentation of this unique course,"
continued Anderson. "Eric is a world class cryptographer,
highly respected in both commercial and government
cryptography circles. In this class he brings to the topic at
hand real world, practical experience that has helped a
majority of government agencies deal with encryption issues."
Courses are regularly scheduled for presentation at the NTI
headquarters in Gresham, Oregon, and at conference facilities
throughout the United States; custom courses can also be
scheduled for presentation at corporate or government sites.
Attendance is $995 per person and includes all course
materials, luncheon and a certificate of completion. NTI (New Technologies, Inc.) is a world leading developer

The founders of NTI were instrumental in the creation of the training courses in the field of Forensic Computer Science that have become the international standard for evidence processing world wide. They developed the first computer evidence courses at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center and created the original training courses and certification for the International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists. These founders have also been
instrumental in developing password recovery software which deals with the breaking of security associated with a majority of the commercial word processing, spread sheet and database software applications. In addition, a majority of the computer evidence processing tools used by law enforcement and military agencies were developed by the founders or employees of NTI.
With the creation of NTI, corporations and government agencies now have access to forensic information and tools which can be used in the identification of computer security risks and in
internal investigations. NTI will also continue to support law enforcement and military agencies by making state-of-the art training and automated forensic tools available at discounted rates. For security reasons, our training courses and forensic software tools are only made available to law enforcement agencies, government agencies, large corporations and consultants who
work with large corporations and/or government agencies.
Applied Cryptography & Cryptanalysis
NTI has three full time cryptographers employed in its Utah offices. Our file encryption software is developed in that facility and Eric Thompson is our senior cryptographer. Eric's credentials are
mentioned elsewhere in our web site. However, it is safe to say that he is one of the top cryptographers in the world and has broken the security associated with most commercial applications that feature encryption or password protection. We rely upon Eric and his team to
teach these courses at the sites of sponsoring government agencies and corporations.

Forensic Tools
The FILTER Forensic Tool:
This program is used to remove binary (non alpha-numeric) characters from computer data. This program has been used internationally by military and law enforcement agencies for years and was donated to the law enforcement community by one of our founders back in 1991. Once a file has been processed with this program the content can be printed and viewed with more traditional types of programs, e.g. word processors. This program should not be confused with NTI's intelligent filter program. ...
The NTIDOC Forensic Tool:
This program is used to essentially take an electronic snap shot of files and subdirectories that have previously been identified to have some evidentiary value. It is a documentation tool. The program automatically creates documentation that can easily be printed, viewed or merged into forensic reports. The original program entitled DOC has been used for years by military and law enforcement computer specialists and has previously been donated for that use by the founders of NTI. ...
The SPACES Security Review Tool:
This program is very simple. It creates one or more files that contain nothing but spaces. To be exact, every file created by this program will contain 10,000 spaces. Such output is ideal in the evaluation of encryption patterns to determine security weakness. Our forensic training courses and cryptography courses cover this concept in detail. MICRO-ID Computer Theft Prevention Software:
This software is used to mark computer hard disk drives with computer ownership information. Once a computer has been marked it can be identified by police should it be recovered as stolen property. The program that reads the ownership information is called COP-ONLY and as the name implies the program is only distributed to local, county and state law enforcement agencies. ...

A couple of news reports on the Key Recovery
critique by Blaze et al from NYT and C|Net:
   Both cite Reinsch of BXA's counter-critique.
And another report on Sybase getting BXA
approval for export of 56-bit crypto without
key recovery. However, it's only for data storage
not communication. The story also reports that
Sybase will be allowed to export 128-bit
crypto with a key recovery plan.
   And, baiting another barb, Senator Kerrey has entered the outline of his crypto bill in the Congressional Record, along with a statement on natsec and commerce and privacy need:
   So the Administration seems to be tickling the market, sending up balloons, wet fingering the air, pulling head out, and so forth, to see who might be induced to
succumb to the strategem of bait-and-bribe, trot-line eager minnows of ga-ga commerce in the national
interest, ahem, like those survivalist national labs,
Bell Labs, Lincoln Labs, Mitres, SAICs, and, their
patrons at National Security councils, departments of commerce, defense, state, energy, justice, et al.

                   MS. LEWIS: It's our understanding, and we just checked
this with people at the White House who know much more about technology than all of us put together, that there is in fact technology being developed that would serve as the equivalent of a V-chip for the
Internet, and we think that's what the President referred to.
                Q Clinton has talked before about giving parents ways to

Ray Arachelian taped the Cryptography Forum at the
Association of the Bar of the City of New York
last evening and will share once its transcribed.
In the meantime:
TITLE OF PROGRAM:
Guns, Ammunition and Cryptography: Is the Government's
Policy on Digital Encryption Creating a Crisis?
Charles R. Nesson, Professor, Harvard Law School
Matt Blaze, Co-author of Risks of Key Recovery paper.
(short-notice invitee)
Lynn McNulty (ex-NIST now RSA) filling in for Jim Bidzos
Scott Charney, Computer Crime Unit, Department of Justice
Kenneth W. Dam, Professor, University of Chicago Law School
Dorothy E. Denning
David J. Farber, University of Pennsylvania
Marc Rotenberg, EPIC
Nesson asked the audience (about a hundred), "How many use encryption?" Over half raised hands. "Wow!" he said, "If I asked that of a law class at Harvard, maybe two or three hands would have been raised."
Nesson then posed to the principal question: "Is the government's
policy on cryptography creating a crisis?"
Dam, Denning and Charney said no. Other panelists said yes.
The audience by show of hands was about evenly split.
There was intense discussion among the panelists but no change in position.
Some highlights:
David Kahn, in the audience, reaffirmed his support for
key escrow, stating that it would not change the current
legal provisions for electronically snooping, and why ask for more privacy than is now authorized.
Blaze summarized the KR risks paper and pointed out the
enormous expense of designing, implementing, operating
and securing a global key recovery system -- which, as he
ironically smiled, could make cryptographers and crypto-corps rich. That such a system might make security weaker by offering fewer choice targets to attack -- the key repositories.
Blaze reminded that encryption will become pervasive in
all electronic systems, not just communications. That it must
be robust and untamperable or more and more crucial systems will be vulnerable to attack. And, the more complicated the
security provisions the more likely they will fail.
Farber stated that time was being wasted on KR debate while
the nation's infrastructure remained immensely vulnerable to
electronic attack. He said that with six students he could shut
the system down in "a few days, with, say, spoof E-mail to key
administrators." That ITEF is working on a next-generation
system to prevent that, but meanwhile there is great risk.
McNulty reaffirmed industry's position that other countries will
develop robust encryption if the US does not allow export.
Charney responded by pointing out that the administration seeks global commitment to key escrow among governments, and asserts they will comply for the same reasons the USG wants it. He said, for example, that countries may allow development of strong crypto but, like the US, will not allow export. He cited Japan's refusal to allow NTT's 128-bit export, and said Russia will surely
not allow the export of the Sun/Elvis product. Same for France, Germany, and so forth.
There was audience derision when Charney noted that the US must
do as the Russians and Chinese and French do to control crypto.
Interestingly, Charney did not cite The Wassenaar Arrangement, although Dam pointed out how difficult it was to reach agreement on the COCOM predecessor and enforce compliance with it.
Nesson summarized Charney's position by saying, "do you mean
that key escrow would do no more than help you catch criminals
too stupid to use unescrowed crypto?" Charney nodded, and said
that "nearly all all criminals we catch by electronic surveillance
talk openly about being surveilled but do nothing about to
avoid it."
Nesson reiterated: "Do you mean that you want a system to catch
stupid criminals while the nation's infrastructure is left
vulnerable?" Charney, "That's not the right way to put it."
Denning gave examples of her recent survey of law enforcement
for examples of crypto use to hinder investigations.
Finally, Dam noted that encryption policy was a different task
than implementing encryption systems. That the detailed understanding
of those who follow the encryption debate is not shared by the
public nor by most officials. That agreement upon policy will
require greater education for those who could not care less about
the complications and subtleties being debated.
An auditor queried: There seems to be agreement that encryption will work best when it is totally transparent to users, and the sooner that is devised the better. Why not just get on with it,?
Blaze shook his head at this cluelessness, howled at the ceiling,
sprouted fur, bared teeth, leaped Dave Farber, went for Charney's
jugular, clawed Denning. Kahn and the suited audience ran screaming into the safe streets of Manhattan, while shaggy coders roared,
"Kill, kill, kill the infrastructure-fuckers."

A supplement to the NYC Crypto Forum:
Toward the end Nesson asked, "How about the missing
participant here, NSA?"
Several panelists noted, "NSA's here, in the audience."
(Nonesuch spoke, however.)
Nesson went on to ask, "What about national security
interests outweighing the right to privacy?"
It was here that David Kahn offered his defense of key
Farber and others responded that the problem is that
the government is not trusted, that guards against
abuse of power have not worked, that national security
too often has been a cloak for illicit actions.
Here, an audience member said that he worked at Salomon
Brothers doing traffic analysis of vast E-mail, and that we
should be aware that more electronic snooping is going on than most people know. How could we be sure that law
enforcement would not similarly abuse systems set up to
catch criminals for other purposes, as NSA allegedly does, and, now using the same methodolgies, as private companies do to spy on employees, customers and competitors.
All panelists nodded at this, that it's hard to tell god from
the devil, and crypto won't help.

   The complaint draws upon previous search warrants at Greg Broiles's site:

@_author: John Young 
@_subject: Jim Bell Complaint 
True, if that's what the friends actually said, and if they were
not induced to do so by being fed lethal information: don't
go down with Bell, protect yourself, spill your guts.
Recall that John Painter spoke to one or more of them
and they hedged the remarks of the complaint, but he,
too, saw the makings of a deal in the affadavit's allegations.
Turning friends against friends is pretty common in
investigations, using threats and promises of relief
from possible charges, even saying that your friend is
squealing on you.
I was struck by how similar some remarks attributed to
Bell were to those attributed to McVeigh, not that they
were not made, but that the investigators chose to
select just those to indicate lethal intent. The possible link between the McVeigh trial and Jim Bell's bust could indicate how the feds are itching to attack
every advocate of anti-gov mayhem (no pun Tim).
The IRS searching the Internet for incriminating advocacy is a warning of what's to come, as often predicted here.
Time to study and ponder the 1st Amend -- which, by the way,
Matt Blaze did at the NYC crypto forum last night to challenge
Charney and Denning. Matt pulled out a copy and cited
it, which may be a good indication of what he knows that
we don't about what's coming.

@_subject: Crypto Disputes 
For full versions of the stories below:
        For two years, the IETF Security Group has labored to
     hammer out the IP Security (IPSec) protocol, a standard way
     that businesses can open up an encrypted link to a trading
     partner's network. The link is encrypted after authentication
     by means of an X.509 digital certificate at an IPSec-based
     firewall or gateway.      But an unresolved, bitter dispute over the technique for
     automatically swapping keys over the 'Net - referred to as
     key management - has resulted in two incompatible schemes
     in the IPSec specification.
     In this battle of the acronyms, the debate centers on the
     Simple Key Management for IP (SKIP), developed by Sun
     Microsystems, Inc., and the Internet Secure Association Key
     Management Protocol (ISAKMP), developed by the National
     Security Agency.      Responding to Sun's announcement that it would license
     128-bit encryption algorithms from Elvis+Co., a Russian
     company, the White House announced that it would look into      Sun's actions.      "Sun's strategy is another brick from a wall that is coming
     down," said Jim Bidzos, president and CEO of RSA Data
     Security. "And it highlights that something is wrong with the      U.S. policy."      Sun has approximately a 10 percent equity stake in Elvis+,
     whose product is based on Sun's publicly available protocol,
     Simple Key Management for IP (SKIP). The 10 percent
     interest is thought to be key to keeping other companies from
     licensing and reselling the same technology.      The government's resolve, however, may be breaking down.
     Just last week, Sybase Inc. won approval to export database
     and server products with 56-bit DES encryption, even though
     the Emeryville, Calif., company has no model for key
     recovery.      SKIP, which stands for Simple Key management for Internet
     Protocols, was submitted by Sun to the Internet Engineering
     Task Force as an Internet standard. Included in SKIP E+ are
     algorithms for 56-bit DES, two- and three-key triple DES,
     and 64- and 128-bit ciphers for encrypting network traffic
     and keys.      The security software was developed by Elvis+, a company
     of former Soviet space scientists with offices near Moscow.
     Sun bought a 10 percent interest in the company in 1993, but
     does not take an active role, said Steven Hunziker, chief
     operating officer of Russia Communications Research Inc.,
     Los Gatos, Calif. RCR represents Elvis+'s products in the
     U.S.      "RCR is really small - me and an accountant and two
     lawyers - and they watch the law like hawks," Hunziker said.
     "Elvis+ has kept a very careful distance from Sun, and those
     guys don't need anything from Sun to create the technology
     they're creating. The FBI and the CIA are just lazy, which is
     why they object."      "We've developed key recovery technology and gotten
     government approval, so we can export without having to
     resort to what they did," said Ken Mendelson, corporate
     counsel for Trusted Information Systems Inc., Glenwood,
     Md.      VeriFone today announced that its Secure Electronic Transaction      (SET) -based product suite has received export approval from the      US Department of Commerce, marking the first announcement
     of a SET-based, end-to-end Internet commerce solution
     containing full strength encryption technology to be approved
     for international export.      VeriFone's vGATE, vPOS and vWALLET software employ
     the SET encryption protocol for transactions over the
     Internet, utilizing 1024 bit key size for public key encryption
     and digital signatures, and 64 bit DES for bulk encryption.
     This approval enables VeriFone to offer a higher level of
     end-to-end encryption than was previously available from
     U.S. corporations to international customers without special
     permission from the U.S. government.      IBM last week took the first steps to help software vendors      comply with federal encryption export rules, with the      release into beta of a new security tool kit.

years back, was confirmed by "a US Defense Department
code-breaker" and predicted the assassinations of
JFK, RFK, Sadat and Rabin.
The NYT reported on the fanfare a few days ago and
quoted some who claimed that the Israelis' claims were
examined and faulted when first published, that the book's bunkum, and that if enough analysis is done on any text, any message can be found -- holy writs being perdurable candidates.
Even so, are any here familiar with the Israelis' work?
Better, is this book the first of many to come to celebrate the
cook-ups of codes and cyphers and algorithmic chefs? Is a film in the works, or, best, a Seinfeld of 0s and 1s?

Lucky's right on Bell's undue incarceration. There's more to the story than tax avoidance. Declan perhaps should look beyond the government's citations of law to examine the other allegations of intent to harm federal officials which did not receive substantiating cites.
The affidavit which prompted Jim's arrest was a potpourri of disingenuous spleen and bile and unintentional humor.
This appears to be another instance of the USG patchworking public menace and phlegm (the Kallstrom syndrome) when it's in its self-preservative and -promotional interest to do so. As Tim and cie often note, the syndrome's fountainhead is DC and world centers of ambitious regulators, enforcers and
promoters for "public security." Which is fast replacing national security, via dual-use sleight of hand, as a career Counterterrorism is the fastest growing governmental subculture at the moment, and no longer aimed overseas. Secret laws,

@_subject: What Will Revolution Look Like? 
Warmaking is ever changing in response to the last wins
and losses. However, winners are less likely to change than losers, for why change a successful formula,
publish it, or a well-spun dissimulation.
As ever, unknown forms of war are in gestation, being
tested and debriefed, in military institutions and
wargames, in business, in education, in the amorphous
culture at large through legal competition and crime
and their variable gray areas where fair and unfair,
civilized rules and their breaking, are ever in grim and vicious dispute.
While there are piles of studies on organized and
guerilla wars of the past, the most provocative are
those that attempt to describe what's coming, how
to recognize its early warnings and what can be done
to head it off or, more likely, advance it.
The highest warmaking art is winning without physical
fighting, to outfox the enemy by demoralizing, by demonstrating that attack is futle, that there is no chance of defeating a superior force. That's why military exhibitionism and psy war is reputed
among military and political leaders to be as vital as that of brute force, as best exemplified by the Cold War 50-year stalemate and psychological "win-win" to
a status of Cool War.
To get a handle on what's in store, imagine that completely unbelievable methods of warfare, overt and covert, are being concocted now, composed of strategies, tactics, warfighters and armaments never before used -- and will not be revealed and understood until too late for defense. Try to forget everything you know about warfighting, crime fighting, conflict resolution, rules of engagement,
black operations, guerilla tactics, hiding among the people. Assume the enemy knows everything you know and
more, is better armed and smarter than you, has more spies among your supporters and in your most intimate Imagine that your toilet, your bed, your fridge, your car, your is triggered to explode by radio or your computer by
your password.
Consider that there will be no time to reflect and reconsider when things go catastrophically wrong and the
enemy is unrelenting attacking with inhuman viciousness, when you're defenses are crumbling and weapons failing,
when mates are squealing, dead or run away, when you can't stop shitting yourself, when your legs are buckling, when your minds racing out of control, when you're begging god
and mom for mercy and the upraised axe is descending, the
barrel back of head is firing.
Remember that who the enemy is is no secret to either side, on whichever side you're on, and presume that the emeny is more ready and able to cook your goose than you are theirs.
What actual war carnage teaches, what the current civil war in the US is showing, is what the TV-sofa war does not: nobody wins, ever, except the mindfuckers who've never gone
berzerk in combat or in the jobplace, killed friend and foe to save own asses.
You only win wars by never having to fight them, those started by weakling cowards unable to steal, cheat and lie well enough to satisfy their demonic lusts.
Best to outsmart the enemy in war, work and love, so that what you're up to is revealed only years later if ever. For
the best won wars are never known at the time, no parades,
no medals, no glory, no war stories, no memorial cemeteries
and monuments, no veteran hospitals filled with carrion, just peace and tranquility shooting deer, harpooning dolpins,
rip-tearing the landscape for profligate cowboy wargames
riding homicidal freeways.
We're all gonna lose our civil war in market place killings and road rage, thanks to today's warfighting lesson in free fire criminal enterprise by those who've never been shot and
shot and shot, and lost for good -- the vainglorious winners,
the losers desperate to regain glory days.

As a strategic bank shot for banning domestic use of encryption the US FBI and Fish and Wildlife Service have declared the pet Bog Snatch Algorithm a terrorist threat:
     (134K)
B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes
    The bog turtle is a target for pet collectors due to its rarity in the wild, distinctive coloration, and small size. Take (primarily illegal) both for the national and international commercial pet trade industry has occurred for many years. Collecting is a significant factor in the species decline and is an ongoing threat to its continued existence in the wild (Anon. 1991; Earley 1993; David Flemming, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in litt. 1991; Herman 1990; Klemens in press; Stearns et al. 1990; Tryon 1990; Tryon and Herman 1990). During the last 5 to 10 years, an increasing number of bog turtles have been advertised for sale, and prices have increased substantially. The increase in price most likely reflects the increase in demand for the turtles; the increase in demand increases the threats to the wild populations (Tryon and Herman 1990).
    Atlanta Zoo personnel reported that from 1989 to early 1991, over 1000 bog turtles were exported to Japan. These figures differ significantly from CITES data and represent a significant amount of unreported illegal trade (Anon. 1991). The World Wildlife Fund recently listed bog turtles as among the world's top 10 ``most wanted'' endangered species (Earley 1993). According to Alan Salzburg, President of the American Turtle and Tortoise Society, the bog turtle is considered the most prized turtle in the United States, and when bog turtle locations become publicly known, they are exploited by collectors within 1 year (Laura Hood, Defenders of Wildlife, in litt.     Due to the threats facing bog turtle populations, the Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles adopted a resolution calling for the prohibition of collection from wild populations (Stearns et al. 1990). Due to the small size of existing populations, and the low reproductive and recruitment potential of this species, the removal of even a few breeding adults can do irrevocable damage to a population (Tryon 1990). Collecting has been a factor in the reduction or extirpation of several bog turtle populations in Delaware (Anon. 1991), Maryland (Anon. 1991; Smith, in litt. 1994), Massachusetts (Anon. 1991), New Jersey (Farrell and Zappalorti 1989; Zappalorti, pers. comm. 1994; Zappalorti, in litt. 1997), New York (Breisch, in litt. 1993; Breisch et al., in litt. 1994; Collins 1990; Behler, in litt. 1997), and Pennsylvania (Ralph Pisapia, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in litt. 1992; Zappalorti, in litt. 1997). Many sites in these States have suitable habitat, but have much-reduced bog turtle populations, probably due to collecting.
    Throughout the bog turtle's entire range, States regulate take through classification of the species as endangered (in Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia) or threatened (in Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee), yet trade continues.
    Illegal trade is difficult to detect due to the questionable origin of turtles being offered for sale. Bog turtles are often ``laundered'' through States which either do not have native populations (e.g., West Virginia, Florida, California), or through States which have inadequate protection of their own bog turtle populations (Charles Bepler, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in litt. 1993; Breisch, in litt. 1993; Michael Klemens, in litt. 1990). For example, in recent years dealers have claimed West Virginia as the State of origin for bog turtles; however, there is no evidence to support the contention that the bog turtle occurs in that State (Dennis Herman, Project Bog Turtle Coordinator, in litt. 1997; Tom Thorp, North Carolina Herpetological Society, in litt. 1997). Hatchling and juvenile turtles marketed as ``captive-born'' are usually offspring from gravid adult females illegally brought into captivity and held until they deposit eggs. The eggs are then hatched in captivity, and the captive-born (but not captive-bred) offspring are then marketed or retained (Bepler, in litt.     A few specific instances of illegal bog turtle collecting and trade are reported below:
    (1) An undercover officer purchased eight bog turtles from a person who had collected them near Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Also, two additional bog turtles were recovered from persons who had gotten them from friends allegedly in the New York area (Bepler, in litt. 1993);
    (2) An individual from New Jersey was arrested for bringing bog turtles from New Jersey to Florida and selling them as captive-born. It is suspected that he collected about six turtles per year over a period of several years (Bepler, in litt. 1993);
    (3) A reliable source in New York reported that over 2000 wild-
caught bog turtles were shipped to Japan in a 2-year period (Murdock, in litt. 1990);
    (4) Researchers found several turtle traps and a much-diminished bog turtle population at an important bog turtle site in Pennsylvania (Pisapia, in litt. 1992);
    (5) In 1993, a New Jersey resident purchased 47 bog turtles in Florida, and since 1984 had also bought 20 additional bog turtles. This individual supposedly has an active breeding program for bog turtles (Terry Tarr, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in litt. 1993);
    (6) When confronted in a New York wetland, an individual claiming to be a birdwatcher revealed the contents of the cloth bag he was carrying--a bog turtle and spotted turtle (Paul Novak, New York Natural Heritage Program, in litt. 1990);
    (7) A reliable source reported seeing approximately 60 bog turtles at the Ohio residence of a person who frequents reptile shows. Based on the physical appearance of the bog turtles, they were not captive-bred (Scott Smith, Maryland Department of Natural Resources, in litt. 1996);
    (8) Bog turtles have been available at the major Herpetological Expo in Orlando, Florida for the last 2 years (Herman, in litt. 1997; Thorp, in litt. 1997); and
    (9) Bog turtles were observed in several Florida dealerships in 1996, although they have not been openly advertised for sale (Herman, in litt. 1997).
    The general consensus among bog turtle researchers, nongame biologists, and law enforcement officials is that illegal collecting is occurring at a much greater rate than detected or reported (Anon. 1991; Breisch, in litt. 1993; Flemming, in litt. 1991). Bog turtles are already extremely low in numbers throughout much of their range, and any additional take could eliminate marginal populations and hamper survival and recovery efforts.
    Protecting existing sites for bog turtles can pose a threat when these specific sites are revealed and publicized. In addition to the threat of collection for the pet trade industry, collection of bog
turtles for exhibition at nature centers is also a threat (Anon. 1991).

 U.S. government takes hard line on Mitnick. US Hacker Pleads for Help  A US 'hacker'- Kevin David  Mitnick - has issued a plea for financial help to  fight his defence case through his lawyer, Donald  C Randolph of Santa Monica,  USA. Through Randolph, Mitnick is claiming that the US government is
seeking to  make an example of him for the possession of unauthorised cellular access

analogue,  rather than digital cellular, is the norm.  In one of the most amazing claims, Mitnick claims to have been kept in solitary

for eight
 months and led to the showers in chains. Perhaps the most puzzling aspect
to the

 that Mitnick profited from his 'hacking' activities - although he could

News report Nov 7, 97:
AT&T, Hewlett Packard, Intel Corporation, Dell Computers, and many other leading computer corporations have been added to the challenge list by Meganet Corporation. The challenge started last week with Bill Gates, now some of his peers have an opportunity to validate or discredit the bold claim that Meganet's VME (Virtual Matrix Encryption) is totally unbreakable. Unbreakable encryption is the only answer to security in our electronic world. This is graphically illustrated by the recent report from the National Security Agency
reporting the open market availability of a $10 chip that can test up to 200 million keys per second. The 56-bit key, government and banking standard, can be compromised in twelve (12) seconds with brute force using ASIC
(Application-specific Integrated Circuits) chips. Meganet has the answer with its new VME (Virtual Matrix Encryption). The impenetrable VME also has extreme speed, much faster than any existing program available today. Major computer companies are already starting discussions to acquire the rights to market this incredible new data encryption system. More information about this
exciting new technology can be found at: Hmm, wonder if it has impenetrable GAK and CAK options.

[Congressional Record: November 7, 1997 (Senate)]
[Page S11959]
                         ENCRYPTION
  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to associate myself with the comments of the majority leader from October 21, 1997. Senator Lott has correctly highlighted the FBI's constantly shifting arguments and the Bureau's seemingly relentless attempts to grab more power at the expense of the Constitution, particularly the fourth amendment's protection of privacy and the fifth amendment's guarantee of due process.
  The FBI legislative proposal goes far beyond the Commerce Committee's misguided encryption legislation in further disregarding our Constitution. Instead of working with those who understand that S.909 gives the FBI unprecedented and troubling authority to invade lives, the FBI has attempted to grab even broader authority. The Senate would be foolish to pass S.909. In no way can we even consider the ill-advised FBI approach. The reach of the FBI has now extended so far that the President has taken the other side of the issue and supported a free market approach, according to his public comments delivered   I can only conclude that the FBI has introduced its proposal as a ploy to make S.909 look like a reasonable compromise. The only other explanation for the FBI's proposal is that the Bureau will not be satisfied with S.909, but instead will continue to work to erode our Constitutional protections. In fact, the new proposal only draws attention to the many problems of the Commerce Committee language. Neither proposal is acceptable.
  The issue of encryption must be revisited in a real and serious way next year, both at the committee level and in the Senate chamber, to examine the many Constitutional implications of the various proposals. I look forward to working with the Majority Leader and other Senators who have expressed interest in encryption legislation.
  I yield the floor.

NYT obit November 8:
Sidney Darlington, a Bell Labs mathematician who pioneered
the design of electronic circuits and whose formulas helped
launch rockets 300 times without error, died on Oct. 31 at his
home in Exeter, N.H. He was 91.
At Bell Labs, in Murray Hill, N.J., where he headed the mathematics research center, Dr. Darlington was ranked
alongside his colleague Claude Shannon for breakthroughs
in communications networks that foreshadowed the integrated
circuit and in turn computers and modern communications.
Dr. Darlington's discovery of ways to custom-design circuits
using precise mathematical specifications, a speciality now
called network synthesis theory, made him a leading authority
in electronic cirsuits for decades, said Dr. Ernest Kuh, a
former colleague who is now at the University of California
at Berkeley.
Before Dr. Darlington's work, circuits were designed in an
intuitive, ad hoc manner. His advances won him the highest
award in his field, the Medal of Honor of the Institute of
Electrical and Electronic Engineers.
At a chalkborad at Bell labs with three or four other rocket
guidance experts, he would scrawl equations that became
the basis for guiding the Air Force Titan I, the Thor-Delta
and dozens of other rockets.
His rocket guidance formulas could instantly plug in the
information from several sources -- the trajectory designed
to launch a staellite, the data from radar that tracked the
rocket, and the instruments in the rocket itself -- and
could then return a flow of commands to the rocket.
Always a tinkerer, Dr. Darlington in the 1950's spent a
weekend at home playing with a new gadget, the transistor.
Trying to get more gain from an amplifier the size of a kernel
of corn, he found a way to combine two or more transistors
in one chip, an idea that became the Darlington Compound
Chip and pointed the way toward integrated circuits.

Dumb of me to get in the middle of this, but the bloodlust's
Tim's statements are gutsy and right: there's no gain
in self-censoring, shading one's anger to appease
the goons of whatever firepower. (Bob, go to end.)
Most massive firepower can't focus on or hit exclusively
small targets, that's what's a lie about "surgical" strikes. Waste the countryside, yes, hit one rabbit and not the

takes is sharpshooting: a one shot, one target, one
pig, one sticker.
True, Horushi's snipe worked, it nailed an innocent, though
a couple of others died to set him up for his own nailing.
True, Waco worked, it charred a crowd of innocents, though a
few others got plugged setting up the roast, and the 2nd roast.
True, firebombing works, as does mass weaponing --nukes, chemicals and germs -- but indiscriminately, by terrorism
of the masses, at the price of also terrifying the citizenry paying for the megadeath heritage.
All standoff firepower is limited against the individual by imprecision of the killing machines and cowardice of the
operators -- artillery, planes, ships, satellites, take your
pick. They savage territory to save the operator's ass,
who, as anyone knows who been around these candyass

What's my point? Well, for lack of a better word, it's personal
courage, going nuts when the time's right, the guts to not shut the fuck up when you're told to by those who're a whole lot bigger, who've got more armaments and thinks they're smarter and more ruthless and meaner and have the troops, rank and medals to back it up. Just remember that most of those strengths are for getting somebody else or a machine to do what is too fucking terrifying to do yourself directly.
Do this when the monster accosts: pull your forelock, say sorry sir, then upstab the fucker's groin, as he doubles, hack the cord, he'll go down quivering, then cut out his liver, kick up his green face, squat close, show him the blob, take a bite, chew, savor, swallow, put lip to dying ear, whisper, "tasty."

Federal Register, November 10, 1997
Excerpt from a Federal Reserve Bank announcement:
      ... the Reserve Banks plan to change their policy for ownership of the encryption boards used by depository institutions with dial and multi-drop connections. These encryption boards are currently purchased and owned by the depository institutions. With the replacement of the encryption boards beginning in the second half of 1998 to enhance the security of the Federal Reserve's communications network, the Reserve Banks plan to purchase and assume ownership of these boards. This approach is consistent with Reserve Bank ownership of other equipment at depository institutions that is required for electronic connections to the Federal Reserve, specifically link encryptors and signaling equipment. Reserve Bank ownership should improve management of the security of the network and facilitate the implementation of an all-electronic key distribution system. This change in policy may affect future-year electronic connection fees, as priced services must recover depreciation costs associated with the new encryption boards.
Are these systems related to Kawika Daguio's comments on
PCCIP forwarded by Declan yesterday? Anyone have more

             But the most likely problems -- there are a couple little babies in this audience, or there were today, and some children -- the most likely problems these children will face when they come of age will be problems that cross national borders -- terrorism, organized crime and drug running, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological weapons and maybe small-scale nuclear weapons.
             This much nuclear cake put in a bomb would do ten times as much damage as the Oklahoma City bomb did.               The spread of environmental problems or diseases across national lines -- we are going to have to, in other words, find ways to cooperate, to keep the organized forces of destruction that are taking advantage of the Internet, the technological revolution, the freedom of travel and the freedom of movement, access to computers and moving money around and all that -- there will always be organized forces of destruction.               That is fundamentally what is at stake in the stand off we're having in Iraq today.  I don't want you to look at this backward through the prism of the Gulf War and think it's a replay.  I want you to look at it forward and think about it in terms of the innocent Japanese people that died in the subway when the saran gas was released; and how important it is for every responsible government in the world to do everything that can possibly be done not to let big stores of chemical or biological weapons fall into the wrong hands, not to let irresponsible people develop the capacity to put them in warheads on missiles or put them in briefcases that could be exploded in small rooms.               And I say this not to frighten you.  The world will always have challenges.  I think the chances are quite good that we can organize ourselves for this challenge and deal with it very effectively.  I personally believe that the next 50 years will be far more peaceful and less dangerous for our children and our grandchildren than the last 50 years were.  I also believe they will be the most prosperous and interesting time in all of human history -- but only if we do the right things.

   the companies that endorsed the proposals are poised to
   take advantage of what could be a $200 billion-plus sales
   arena by the year 2000.
   Other companies in the coalition include Apple Computer
   Inc., Data General Corp., NCR Corp., Silicon Graphics Inc.,
   Stratus Computer Inc. and Unisys Corp.
   Although the policy recommendations are another example of
   Silicon Valley's current hot and heavy relationship with
   the nation's capital, the paper is hardly a love letter.
   One familiar refrain: Though industry needs government's
   help, Washington should keep its presence to a minimum.
   There is even a sense that some of the CEOs are reluctant
   to sully themselves by becoming overly involved in matters
   of politics.
   "I have no specific interest in lobbying in the strict
   sense," says Lars Nyberg, the CEO of NCR, co-chairman of
   the authoring committee with IBM's Louis V. Gerstner Jr.
   "Politicians can help this change or they can slow the
   evolution dramatically. We have the responsibility to make
   sure that doesn't happen. So, this is just something we
   have to do."
   The paper's authors are perhaps at their least subtle where
   they chide the Federal Communications Commission for what
   they believe is a plodding and shoddy implementation of the
   Telecommunications Act of 1996. The group argues that in
   order to populate the new digital domain, consumers need
   inexpensive, readily available access to an array of
   telecommunications services.
   Coalition members are concerned about the lack of
   competition in local telephone markets. They insist that
   local monopolies have hampered technological progress.
   "Until there is competition in the local markets for data
   and digital traffic, there will be no pressure on the
   incumbent telephone carriers to deploy new technologies."
   the group states.
   On the tax issue, the CEOs advocate "tax neutrality,"
   meaning that no tax system should discriminate based on the
   way a consumer purchases a product. Uncoordinated attempts
   to "force fit" existing tax structures, for example, "could
   impose discriminatory and multiple taxes on e-commerce
   transactions." they say. To avoid the problem, the group
   prods Congress to pass pending legislation to put a
   moratorium on new Internet sales taxes while industry,
   federal and local governments worked out a national
   standard for levying taxes on Internet commerce. The
   paper's authors are also pushing for a comparable
   international moratorium.
   As for the Internet's legal framework, the paper calls for
   an immediate amendment to the Uniform Commercial Code, one
   that updates contract laws and consumer protection rules
   for on-line transactions.
   The paper is most vague in its prescriptions for encryption
   policy, an area where government and industry have clashed
   on numerous occasions. The U.S. has held tight restrictions
   on the export of strong encryption software, which can be
   used to ensure security for Internet transactions,
   contending that it would be impossible to protect citizens
   from hacker attacks and other digital misdeeds if strong
   encryption were  made available overseas. The coalition is
   critical of the administration's stance, but offers few
   specific solutions.
   In part, the paper is a response to a challenge the White
   House issued last summer. In July, the Clinton
   administration released its "Framework for Global
   Electronic Commerce," a far-reaching set of policy
   prescriptions authored by Ira Magaziner, the president's
   senior adviser on policy development. Throughout the paper,
   Mr. Magaziner stressed that government should take a
   passive role in regulating the Internet. His preferred
   alternative: Help industry to set its own rules and standards.
   Mr. Magaziner called the coalition's paper "a very
   interesting, useful and helpful initiative." He said, "The
   principles are consistent with what we're hoping for. And,
   what's important is they are stepping up and leading."
   Convincing Congress, much less foreign entities, to agree
   on these issues will be difficult, however. Over the next
   few weeks, members of the coalition plan to travel overseas
   with their message. The group expects to meet with members
   of Congress, White House advisers and FCC officials
   sometime in January.

[Congressional Record: November 13, 1997 (Extensions)]
                  ON LIFTING THE ENCRYPTION EXPORT BAN
                                 ______
                            HON. ADAM SMITH
                             of washington
                    in the house of representatives
                      Thursday, November 13, 1997
  Mr. ADAM SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak
about an issue that is very important to me--lifting unfair export
controls on encryption technology.
  Mr. Speaker, protecting our National Security interests is among my
highest priorities. If I thought controlling encryption exports worked
toward this end, I would be its strongest proponent. Unfortunately,
export controls on encryption software simply disadvantage the United
States software industry.
  Under current law the United States allows only 40 bit encryption
codes to be exported, although software companies sell encryption codes
of up to 128 bits everywhere in the United States. Forty bit encryption
technology is so elementary, it took a graduate student a mere 3\1/2\
hours to break a code last January. Fifty-six bit encryption is 65,000
times more difficult to decode than 10 bit encryption and it only took
students three months to break the encryption code. One hundred twenty
eight bit encryption has not been broken yet.
  Naturally, foreign companies do not want to buy 40 bit encryption
software, because it is so vulnerable and insecure. The possibilities
for ``computer hackers'' to break into the system and wreak havoc are
enormous and dangerous. Therefore, foreign companies are purchasing
high-level encryption from foreign software providers instead of
American ones.
  The international demand for encryption software is growing
exponentially because of the tremendous rise in electronic commerce.
For instance, German Economics Minister, Guenter Rexrodt, said, ``Users
can only protect themselves against having data manipulated, destroyed,
or spied on by strong encryption procedures * * *. That is why we have
to use all of our powers to promote such procedures instead of blocking
  Our export restraint has not kept the technology from proliferating.
It has merely allowed foreign producers of strong encryption technology
to fill the vacuum. In fact, American companies are partnering with
foreign firms to distribute their software--taking jobs and revenue
with them.
  American-owned Sun Computers has recently joined with a Russian
software company to avoid the U.S. export ban and sell to foreign
markets. Foreign companies can also purchase American-produced 40 bit
encryption technology and upgrade it in their own countries to 128 bit
encryption technology. This ``add-on'' industry is among the fastest
growing software industries in Europe today. Clearly, if someone wants
high-level encryption technology, he or she can easily obtain it.
  The ability to obtain both powerful and affordable encryption will
now become easier with recent developments in Canada. The Canadian
Government includes encryption software in decontrolling mass market
software under the Generic Software Note. This means any software sold
over-the-counter, by mail or on the phone may be exported without
limits. Entrust, a Canadian software company, is freely marketing and
selling internationally a 128 bit encryption program right now. It
sells for less than $50, and Entrust provides a version of the
encryption technology free on the Internet. Even our most steadfast
ally sees that export controls can no longer help stem the overwhelming
demand and spread of unbreakable encryption.
  Mr. Speaker, if the United States continues to impose these
restrictive export bans on its own companies, ``foreign competition
could emerge at a level significant enough to damage the present U.S.
world leadership'' in the software industry, according to the National
Research Council's blue-ribbon panel on encryption policy. If our
export ban continues, the United States will not be the worldwide
leader on encryption technology for long, and that would be a true risk
to our national security.
  I strongly oppose any unilateral sanctions or regulations that put
the United States at an unnecessary disadvantage. Our current export
ban on encryption software is a perfect example, and I intend to
continue the fight to change our policy and allow the United States to
compete in the global software market.

To amplify this a bit: the explanation also included the
speculation of cascading fuel being ignited from the
bottom and flaming upward, which could be interpreted by the observers as a missile rising. An interesting view which I wonder if any of our scientists
here find credible. Perhaps I missed it, but I don't recall the CIA video showing
upward flaming fuel, rather it showed a billowing explosion
centered on the main fuel tank of the upturning fuselage
(as the front cabin plummeted).
Is it feasible that the fuel would ignite and flame upward that way or would it be too broadly dispersed by speed and the atmosphere to cause a coherent, shaped flame such as that of a missile tail? For example, would an adept pilot be able to tell the difference?
This is posed because of the way several theories of
the OKC blomb blast got it wrong due to overly
narrow initial interpretation as did misinterpretations
of other controversial "terrorisms."
Perhaps Tim May is correct in his assessment of Jim,
but NTSC's upcoming hearing should produce more reliable technical information than Kallstrom appears to be comfortable handling -- given his bent for melodrama fine details of investigation seem to be an annoyance,
although he appeared to like the assurance of the CIA's virtual reality.
Kallstrom also said that the case will remain open, I guess
in case Boeing or TWA or something needs to be zapped
by blind justice.

Network World, November 15, 1997:
 Welcome To Cyberspace. Your Papers Please?  About a year ago, the Treasury Department issued a little-noticed discussion  document entitled "Selected Tax Policy Implications of Global Electronic  Commerce" ( Beavering away in obscurity, these unelected  technocrats have almost finished turning the broad "implications" into
detailed  regulations. Like most tax rulings, these regulations require no further  congressional action to have the force of law. So, while rehabilitated Clinton  apparatchik Ira Magaziner was out mesmerizing the digerati with his  "Framework for Global Electronic Commerce," promising free markets and no new  taxes, the green-eyeshade boys were quietly laying the groundwork to launch
the  IRS into cyberspace. ...
 The classic strategy of forcing reporting requirements on key "taxing
points," such
 as banks, clearinghouses and other financial institutions, is not likely to
work as
 the need for intermediation on the Internet will be vastly reduced. In many
 that's the whole point of electronic commerce. Any reporting burdens must be
 pushed out to the end points of each transaction. How will this be done?
This is
 where Big Brother may arrive big time.  Under active consideration is a plan to require taxpayers to obtain digital
IDs for all
 electronic transactions, keeping records that could be examined on audit.
The IDs
 would be issued by IRS certified agencies, subject to government developed
 standards to ensure that proper identity checks are performed before anyone is
 allowed to shop online. The IRS would enforce this by issuing its own digital
 certificates to issuers of digital IDs so that they can electronically
prove that they
 have received IRS certification. The technology they need to make this
happen is
 available. All that's missing are the regulations forcing compliance. So,
stay tuned.

Jim Bell was scheduled to be sentenced today at 9:30 AM.
I called the court's ever-helpful administrative office (1-253-593-6754) for a report and was told that sentencing had been postponed until December 12, 10:30AM.
Other info:
Mail sent to Jim (not by me) since his request for books has been returned twice that I know about
Books sent to Kitsap County jail, where he was first incarcerated,
was returned marked "Not in Jail." After this an inquiry to the court was made about Jim's location (not by me) and it was learned that he had been
transferred to Federal Detention Center at SeaTac, WA.
A letter sent there recently was returned unopened, marked "Return to Writer."
The court docket today at 8:00PM does not list his relocation nor the new sentencing date. However, entries usually appear
a day or so after an action:
   Perhaps one of our legal subscribers could comment on what's
going on with these repeated delays in sentencing, especially
whether it's common to do so after a plea agreement is reached.
Now, scuttlebutt: a person at a Seattle legal document service
told me today that another case is coming up similar to Jim's
that also alleges "intimidation of IRS officials." Whether that
relates to delays in Jim's case is a mystery inside an enigma.

To buttress suggestions for simulating the OKC bombing, here's an SAIC press release of August 1997 on a training program for disaster handling:
SAIC AND TEEX TO PROVIDE ANTI-TERRORISM TRAINING TO FIRST RESPONDERS (MCLEAN, VA) Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) has signed an agreement with the Texas Engineering Extension Service (TEEX) to prepare civilian emergency responders for possible terrorist events. Under the agreement, SAIC and its teaming partners will provide training to firefighters and other first response personnel in the latest technologies for addressing chemical and biological terrorism. As the leader of the team, TEEX will hold training classes at Texas A&M University's Emergency Response Training Field at College Station, Texas, where firefighters and rescue workers will train in virtual reality simulators on the effects of chemical and biological weapons. TEEX, which is a member of the Texas A&M University System, annually provides training to 129,000 individuals and last year provided fire, rescue and hazardous materials training nationally and internationally to more than 28,000
responders. "The United States has been fortunate in that it has not had a successful terrorist attack perpetrated against it using biological or chemical agents," said G. Kemble Bennett, TEEX's CEO who oversees the 120-acre Brayton Fire Training Field. "However, experts agree that it is only a matter of time." "As a leader in chemical and biological warfare agent accident, response and assistance training for military and civilian emergency response agencies, SAIC can offer expert guidance to responders," said William L. Chadsey, senior vice president at SAIC. "Our company has provided emergency planning and consultative services to personnel and public service organizations worldwide." In September, U.S. Representative Curt Weldon (R-Pa.) is expected to introduce a bill in Congress to designate the training field at Texas A&M and its facilities as The National Training Center for Urban Search and Rescue. The new center is expected to feature building collapse simulators and a facility dubbed "Disaster City" to prepare responders to handle earthquakes and bombings in addition to chemical and biological agents. If approved, Rep. Weldonï¿½s bill also is likely to facilitate the release of information from Bechtel Nevada at the Nevada Test Site about the handling of nuclear materials. Speaking at the signing ceremony, Fire Chief Gary Marrs of Oklahoma City, Okla., said, "The first responders in our communities, and specifically our firefighters, are tasked to respond and make a difference when disasters occur. Until the training and equipment,
utilizing the latest in technology, get down to the street level, we put our responders at an extreme disadvantage and endanger their lives. I am encouraged to see these types of cooperative efforts make this training and technology available to the men and women of the fire service who protect our cities daily." Marrs, who managed the fire and rescue mission at the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, chairs the Urban Search and Rescue Committee for the International Association of Fire Chiefs located in Fairfax, Va.

Several other possibilities have circulated:

a doctor's visit, or psychosomatically, due to the strain of indefinite
incarceration and pressures of interrogation.
2. Jim is not fully cooperating, say, refusing to name others or provide
evidence about his own activities or those of others.
3. Jim's behaving erratically, sometimes cooperative, sometimes
4. Jim's drawing out cooperation, negotiating for a better deal, perhaps
with his attorney's advice to do so.
5. Jim is faking it, convincingly, sending the feds off on wild goose chases, working with confederates on preplanned ruses.
6. Jim is not what he appears to be, never was, and nobody gets what he's up to. The current Jim just another ploy, AP a lure.
7. Finally, no disrespect intended -- first time jail is one shitty experience,
with nightmares of lonely long time sentence worse than most of us will ever know -- Jim freaks on sentencing day, shits himself, collapses, can't face what's coming, and the court mercifully delays the
day reckoning.
Still, there's a slim chance he's enjoying himself in Seattle or DC, working

  In a hearing in U.S. District Court in Tacoma this morning,   Bell 's public defender and an assistant U.S. Attorney recommended   a 6-to-12-month jail sentence for Bell as part of a plea-bargain   agreement.
  But federal probation officers recommended a sentence of 27 months.   In doing so, they said they were looking at the "totality" of Bell's   behavior, including the threatening nature of his Internet essay,   "Assassination Politics."   As a result, U.S. District Court Judge Franklin D. Burgess said he   was uncomfortable with the situation. "Somehow I am getting a feeling   that somebody knows more about something than I do," Burgess said.
Also reported: Jim had encrypted some of his files. And though "Bell
plead guilty to relatively innocuous charges" IRS investigators
compared him to The Unabomber and Tim McVeigh, and claimed he
was "part of a far darker scheme to assassinate IRS agents and topple the   U.S. government."

Under national security programs DoD has funded through its pervasive tentacles scientists and mathematicians, libertarians and socialists, elite and trailer trash, Wall Street and underworld, on and on. Not a chance of stopping it any time soon.
It is doubtful that any other more bountiful and widespread source of condoned bribery has ever existed, and it shows no sign of
slackening, in the US or elsewhere, whether democracies, oligarchies, communist, or offshore outlaw, even allowing for the burgeoning private
armies, cops, gun faith forces, each loading up with new and "surplus"
Curiously, when the details of how it all works is pointed out, no one
seems to be bothered by it, except to comlain that others are getting
too much, to wheelle more leads on how to leverage more for their affinity gang, and, to conceal sly avarice, to blame the competition
for cheating better.
So, Monty, for comparing to Minsky's well-known federal work at MIT, as with many here, how about demonstrating the correlation of your work with inescapable defense funding complicity?

There are a number of US cases in the just published "Secrets:
The CIA's War at Home," by Angus Mackenzie.
What is worth exploring to supplement the perhaps too facile
gov-bash is the burgeoning private industry of illegal electronic surveillance, staffed with mostly ex-gov folks (and those not deft enough to get a global Cold War sinecure) who are not always as scrupulous as the government. These operations are
growing worldwide as governments down-size, up-size and
sneaky-rig their NatSec and LE programs, often most slyly
by privatizing them behind false fronts.
Indeed, the bigger story may be the ways illegal electronic snooping is being hidden behind "legal" operations by both
government and industry, often working in concert to
camouflage the bastardly deeds by pointing fingers at
each other to justify higher budgets and higher fees and
more restrictions on free expression. Get Stewart Baker

Europeans Reject U.S. Plan On Electronic Cryptography    Threats to Privacy and Commerce Are Cited
By Edmund L. Andrews
Frankfurt, Oct. 8 -- The European Commission has rejected proposals by
the United States aimed at insuring that police agencies can crack coded
messages over telephone and computer networks.
In a lengthy report released today, the European Commission said the
American approach could threaten privacy and stifle the growth of
electronic commerce and that it might simply be ineffective.
The report appears to all but doom efforts by the Clinton Administration
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to establish a global system in
which people who use cryptography would have to deposit a "key" for
unlocking their codes with an independent outside organization. As
envisioned, the police or intelligence agents would be able to use this key
once they got court approval to carry out a wiretap. The plan has been
vigorously opposed by the computer industry, which fears that it would
jeopardize sales to foreign customers.
Because of the Internet's borderless nature, American officials have long
acknowledged that their plan is workable only if most other countries
adopt similar systems. If not, people could simply route their
communications through countries with no restrictions.
The White House had already run into heavy opposition from civil rights
groups, the computer industry and Congressional Republicans. And
earlier this year, the United States failed to muster any support for its plan
from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a
consortium backed by more than 40 countries.
But the European Commission's blunt opposition, reported today in The
Wall Street Journal, went considerably further, raising a slew of objections
to "key recovery" and "key escrow," systems. Among them were these:
+ Hackers could find new ways to breach security." Inevitably, any key
access scheme introduces additional ways to break into a cryptographic
system," the report said.
+ The systems could weaken European data-privacy laws. "Any regulation
hindering the use of encryption products," the report said, "hinders the
secure and free flow of personal information."
+ Even with a "key escrow" or "key recovery" system, criminals cannot be
entirely prevented from using strong encryption.
More broadly, the European Commission said, any kind of key-based
system could jeopardize the rise of electronic commerce. "If citizens and
companies have to fear that their communication and transactions are
monitored with the help of key access or similar schemes," the report
said, "they may prefer remaining in the anonymous off-line world."
American officials did not disguise their disappointment, and challenged
the Europeans to come up with better alternatives.
"I am a little surprised," said William Reinsch, Deputy Secretary of
Commerce in charge of export administration. "My question to the
European Commission is, where do they think the market is going? Our
sense is that corporations engaged in electronic commerce want key
recovery in some form, because they want to recover their own records
and to monitor their own employees."
Beyond high-minded policy issues, European officials quietly
acknowledge that they have political and economic concerns. For one
thing, several countries do not like the idea of deferring to an American
system that might allow American companies to dominate the next
generation of security products.
The German Government, meanwhile, is worried that American authorities
might have improper access to data on German users -- possibly violating
Germany's tough new laws on data protection.
But the European Union is far from united. Britain has generally sided with the United States in supporting an international system for
regulating data encryption.
Indeed, the European Commission remained vague about what
alternatives to the American system it might actually favor, nor does the
report attempt to block member countries from setting up key-based
systems if they want to.
American computer and software companies greeted the European policy
declaration as a victory.
"Even the hard-line Governments, the U.S. and the United Kingdom, have
said that any cryptography restrictions have to be internationally
coordinated because otherwise you can just download material from
another country," said Chris Kuner, a lawyer in Frankfurt who represents
Netscape Communications and other networking companies in Europe.
"This shows that Europe does not agree with the idea of mandatory key
recovery. This idea that is the only possible regulatory framework for the
world has been clearly rejected."

Dimitri, Allah bless his carcass, is a learned and deft provocateur.

Excerpt below of statement on encryption policy by Senate Majority Leader Lott published in the October 21 Congressional Record.
Full statement at:        (12K)
Senator Lott:
  During the past month, the FBI has attempted to change the debate by proposing a series of new mandatory controls on the domestic sale and use of encryption products. Let me be clear. There are currently no restrictions on the rights of Americans to use encryption to protect their personal financial or medical records or their private e-mail messages. There have never been domestic limitations, and similarly, American businesses have always been free to buy and use the strongest possible encryption to protect sensitive information from being stolen or changed. But now, the FBI proposes to change all that.
  The FBI wants to require that any company that produces or offers encryption security products or services guarantee immediate access to plain text information without the knowledge of the user. Their proposal would subject software companies and telecommunications providers to prison sentences for failure to guarantee immediate access to all information on the desktop computers of all Americans. That would move us into an entirely new world of surveillance, a very intrusive surveillance, where every communication by every individual can be accessed by the FBI.
  Where is probable cause? Why has the FBI assumed that all Americans are going to be involved in criminal activities? Where is the   And how would this proposal possibly help the FBI? According to a forthcoming book by the M.I.T. Press, of the tens of thousands of cases handled annually by the FBI, only a handful have involved encryption of any type, and even fewer involved encryption of computer data. Let's face it--despite the movies, the FBI solves its cases with good old-
fashioned police work, questioning potential witnesses, gathering material evidence, and using electronic bugging or putting microphones on informants. Restricting encryption technology in the U.S. would not be very helpful to the FBI.
  The FBI proposal won't work. I have talked with experts in the world of software and cryptography, who have explained that the technology which would provide compliance with the FBI standard simply does not exist. The FBI proposal would force a large unfunded mandate on our high technology firms, at a time when there is no practical way to accomplish that mandate.
  Rather than solve problems in our export policy, this FBI proposal would create a whole new body of law and regulations restricting our domestic market.
  This and similar proposals would also have a serious impact on our foreign market. Overseas businesses and governments believe that the U.S. might use its keys to computer encryption systems to spy on their businesses and politicians. Most U.S. software and hardware manufacturers believe this is bad for business and that nobody will trust the security of U.S. encryption products if this current policy continues. In fact, this proposal appears to violate the European Union's data-privacy laws, and the European Commission is expected to reject it this week.
  So, the FBI proposal would: Invade our privacy; be of minimal use to the FBI; would require nonexistent technology; would create new administrative burdens; and would seriously damage our foreign markets.
  This is quite a list.
  Mr. President, the FBI proposal is simply wrong. I have learned that even the administration does not support this new FBI proposal. So why does the FBI believe it must now subject all Americans to more and more   This independent action by the FBI has created confusion and mixed signals which are troublesome for the Senate as it works on this legislation. Perhaps the FBI and the Justice Department need to focus immediately on a coordinated encryption position.
  Mr. President, I congratulate the members of the House Commerce Committee for rejecting this FBI approach by a vote margin of more than 2 to 1.

@_subject: David Kahn on National Encryption Policy 
This was published in the October 22 Congressional Record as
part of a statement by Senator Moynihan on the retirement of
NSA Deputy Director William Crowell:
                      [From Newsday, Oct. 6, 1997]
    National Security Official Retires--Helped Refocus Agency's Aims
                            (By David Kahn)
       The National Security Agency has said goodbye to its      retiring deputy director, who largely brought the super-
     secret spy organization into its public, post-Cold War      posture.
       William P. Crowell was the force behind the establishment      of the National Cryptologic Museum, which exhibits what had      been some of the nation's deepest secrets; the revelation of      the VENONA project, which broke Soviet spy codes early in the      Cold War; and the National Encryption Policy, which seeks to      balance personal privacy with national security.
       Succeeding Crowell will be Barbara McNamara, who, like      Crowell, is a career employee of the agency, which breaks      foreign codes and makes American Codes for the United States      government.
       McNamara is the second female deputy director of the      agency. The first, Ann Z. Caracristi, who served from 1980 to      1982, is the sister of the late Newsday photographer Jimmy      Caracristi.
       More than 500 present and past members of the agency      attended Crowell's recent retirement ceremony at its glossy,      triple-fenced headquarters at Fort Meade, Md. They applauded      as he was presented with awards for his intelligence and      executive services and with a folded American flag that had      flow over the agency.
       They laughed as a picture, claimed to be his retirement      portrait, was unveiled: It was a photograph of Crowell,      notorious for his love of motorcycles, astride his fancy      bike. During his acceptance speech, Crowell choked up when he      thanked his wife, Judy, a former agency employee and fellow      motorcyclist, for her help.
       The agency director, Air Force Lt. Gen. Kenneth Minihan,      recited some of the administrative landmarks of Crowell's      career.
       Crowell, 58, a native of Louisiana, began in New York City      in 1962 as an agency recruiter. In 1969, when he sought an      assignment to operations, he became instead an executive      assistant to the then-director. He eventually got to      operations, where he rose to be chief of W group, whose      function remains secret, and then chief of A group, which      focused on the then-Soviet Union. After a year in private      industry, he rose through other posts to the deputy      directorship on Feb. 2, 1994.
       Among his organizational accomplishments were conceiving a      crisis action center and linking the agency with other      producers of intelligence to improve information exchange.
       His more public initiatives included the museum and the      VENONA disclosures, which sought to maintain public support      for the agency after the disappearance of the Soviet Union.      The National Encryption Policy seeks to enable the agency to      read the messages of terrorists and international criminals      who use computer-based, unbreakable ciphers while enabling      individuals to use good cryptosecurity to preserve such      rights as security on the Internet.

"Self-reliance and socialism are diversions confected by
capitalism to conceal its evils," some poor bastard finally understood, muttered to nobody and died.
Nearly all governments are socialist to some degree
in that they provide services (bribes) that other social
structures do not; even the vilest must do so to fend off the hordes, rebels and revolutionists, or go broke funding
the military, guards, spies and police, as most eventually
do like the wealthy being sucked empty by their lawyers,
bankers, families and lovers.
Indeed, the most fervent proponents of coercive force
are those who have the greatest wealth to protect against
the folks trying to get it by all possible means. "More cops,
more laws, more education in obedience, more loyalty
oaths and prenupital 'surely you're joking's."
However, even those of great wealth know that mere
coercive power is not enough, that you've got to employ
religion, education, culture and social pressure to induce
acceptance that some have it and some don't, and screw those who don't -- keep the Armalite handy. Borrowing from the Catholic Church, John Calvin tweaked this wealth-hoarding philosophy to a high-definition blind faith in predestination: one is born to have it and too bad about the others -- which relieves those who got it by luck and crime (misnamed self-reliant hard work and careful planning) and can't quite find solace in their own self-deception, can't
quite believe their protectors are trustworthy.
Calvinist voodoo in updated guises has been for a couple of centuries the fundamentalist faith of the newly wealthy of the industrial (and now electronic) culture, and economic soothsayers know how to keep the grants, lecture fees and book profits coming by peddling all sorts of new versions especially tailored to fit semi-ignorant, fearful souls unsure how to capitalize on their capital, and terrified that it will evaporate just as inexplicably as it rained down on the very spot they happened to be at while all around them folks
were dying of drought.
None of this applies to the good hearts on this list, who are
amazingly generous of their time to contribute wit and wisdom
and frank admission that what else can one do except
joke about god's folly, endure the drought and pray that the rains come and shit storms don't. As now in southeast Asia.
What an amazing RICO op is Wall Street, now World Street, comparable to RICO government, now world gov, composed
of the same Bosses and Pols working hand in hand to
smirk, smirk blame the other, both knowing that self-reliance
and socialism are for clueless fools unable to grasp the wonders of highly organized theft to avoid labor (and taxes) altogether, that coercive-capitalist-gov self-delusion unable
to stanch the endlessly increasing cost of defending security Now, I have to confess that stock market plunges lift my spirits wonderfully. Without that I have only the WSJ's thigh-slapping

5 September 1997, MSNBC:
FBI Director Louis Freeh floats a new proposal at a congressional hearing to outlaw non-breakable crypto products.
A radical shift in crypto debate
Proposed bill outlaws non-crackable crypto products, restrict imports
By Brock N. Meeks, MSNBC
WASHINGTON -- The White House would likely be very sympathetic to a
controversial new bill that would outlaw all encryption software that doesn't allow law enforcement agencies to immediately decode scrambled messages, an administration official told MSNBC.
The new bill, still in draft form, is quietly circulating among members of the House and Senate. Although the administration hasn't formally endorsed any provisions of the bill, MSNBC has learned that the White House has been providing what is called technical drafting assistance
to members of Congress writing the bill. William Reinsch, the Commerce Department undersecretary for export administration, confirmed the White House involvement for MSNBC on Thursday night.
The draft bill was already in the hands of some members of the Senate's Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and Government Regulation when FBI Director Louis Freeh outlined its basic provisions while testifying before
the panel Wednesday. Freeh said "we would recommend" that legislation be written requiring all encryption software or services made in or imported to the United States to have a feature "which would allow for the immediate, lawful decryption" of any scrambled messages used for illegal purposes or in a national security matter.
NATION AT RISK?
The White House, FBI and intelligence agencies claim that the proliferation of unbreakable encryption products puts the nation at risk. Criminals and terrorists are increasingly using unbreakable encryption products, Freeh
testified Wednesday. U.S. makers of encryption software claim that any government-mandated decoding features would make their products unacceptable to clients in the global marketplace. The new proposals outlined by Freeh also drew the ire of civil
liberties groups, which fear that any government controls on encryption products raise serious First Amendment and privacy concerns.
Placing such government-mandated controls on the domestic use and manufacture of encryption software, as well as on the import of encryption products, stands in marked contrast to current White House crypto policies. Currently,
the United States places strict regulations on the export of any encryption products that do make decoding keys available to law enforcement agencies. However, the administration has steadfastly maintained throughout the often
contentious public debate over encryption policies that it would not place any restrictions on the domestic use of encryption software, nor would it
restrict the import of encryption products. Despite Freeh's testimony and the draft legislation written with White House assistance, Reinsch said the administration's policy on encryption hasn't changed. "I want to emphasize that [in providing drafting assistance] we are
responding to committee requests," he said. "And those requests have been fairly directive, such as: 'Give us some examples of how we can better accommodate law enforcement needs.' " Currently, the White House is backing an encryption bill in the Senate called the Secure Public Networks Act, also known as S. 909. This bill would encourage the use of and set up guidelines for encryption software products with decoding keys. Under this plan, all coded messages would spin off a decoding key that would be stored with a government-approved third party. Law enforcement agencies, foreign or domestic, would be allowed access to those keys if they obtained a court-ordered warrant. The bill would not restrict or require any encryption software used in the United States, or restrict the import of any foreign crypto products. However, MSNBC has learned that the draft bill now circulating among members of the House and Senate specifically outlaws the "manufacture, distribution or import" of any encryption software product or communication device that does not "allow the immediate decryption" of all scrambled messages or communications "if used for illegal purposes." The bill also targets "network services," such as Internet Service Providers, that provide encryption capabilities to their clients.
BAN WOULD GO INTO EFFECT IN 1999
Under this proposed bill, if such encryption services are offered by a company like ISP, the service provider must build in a provision to allow
for immediate decryption of any scrambled messages, according to several sources that have seen the draft language. The software ban would
go into effect in January 1999.
Reinsch told MSNBC he wasn't sure that Freeh's testimony "accurately reflected" the language the White House offered in its technica
drafting for congressional committees. However, he indicated the administration was interested in Freeh's proposal.
"I'll be blunt about it," Reinsch said. If such a bill were approved by a congressional committee, the administration "would look very seriously at it and I imagine we would be very sympathetic to it," he said.
Opponents of proposals to require key for all encryption software blanched at Freeh's statements. "This proposal crosses a line that hasn't been crossed before in the area of domestic controls on crypto," said Alan
Davidson, policy analyst for the Center for Democracy and Technology. Davidson said a government mandate to provide immediate decryption capabilities would be like "forcing everyone to live in a glass house."
It also "trashes the Fourth Amendment," which guarantees a right to be protected from unlawful search and seizure, Davidson said.
Freeh told the Senate panel Wednesday that he isn't looking to expand law enforcement's investigative powers. Rather, he said, he is only looking for a "Fourth Amendment that works in the Information Age."

3. Finds the SAFE bill unhelpful but likes its crypto-criminalization
provision and favors McCain-Kerrey's Secure Public Network Act bill or other legislation that will:
  Expressly confirm the freedom of domestic users to choose   any type or strength of encryption.
  Explicitly state that participation in a key management   infrastructure is voluntary .
  Set forth legal conditions for the release of recovery   information to law enforcement officials pursuant to lawful   authority and provide liability protection for key recovery   agents who have properly released such information.

Jacket blurb:
As the U.S. Congress prepares to adopt a state-of-the-art
encryption program with a secret key that would allow
government access to all electronic communications, a
brilliant codemaker stands ready to expose the program's
critical flaw. Together with a determined band of
cypherpunks and hacker activists, he plans to unveil his
own code, which will ensure the privacy of all communication
on the Internet -- and that not even the government will
hold the key.
Fresh out of law school, Harry Garnet walks straight into
trouble when he accidentally delivers a deadly diskette
that explodes inside the computer of a mathematics
professor -- and kills him. In the aftermath, Harry joins
up with the man's clever daughter, Annie Ames, to track
the killer. Ther journey leads from a sleepy Adirondack
town to New York city, where -- with the inadvertent help
of Harry's scheming hacker friend Blaney -- Harry learns of the professor's connection to the anarchists and computer
phreaks who make up the underground Urban Crypto Militia.
The group's leader, Lionel Sullivan, is as talented a
codemaker as the professor had been. As the only one of
the bomber's intended victims who has managed to survive,
he can also offer Harry and Anne crucial insights into the
killer's motives. But it's not long before the bomber strikes
again -- this time against Harry and Annie, who still possess
the professor's secret computer files.
In a riveting race agaisnt time, Harry and Annie must navigate
secret networks and on-line fantasy worlds as they struggle to
unlock the professor's final message. It seems to point to a
fatal crack in the Patriot encryption program, which is about
to become the national standard -- and which Lionel and his
group are about to challenge in a dramatic showdown. Unless

praised for its novelistic texture and fast pace. Now, in
Flame War, they use their keen jounalistic instincts and eye

today's news -- and a climax that's plausible enough that it
could become tomorrow's headlines.

a big payoff with stock options, though most don't -- to free-lancers getting large fees for short-time work, up to
$200/hr and $300,000 per year. Not that all do so well.

We've received from anonymous a report on breaking
Mondex's pilot system by TNO along with a confidential

   TNO's Ernst Bovenlander gave some details of these    attacks (though he didn't mention Mondex as the target).    He showed an electron micrograph of a fuzed link in a    smartcard; while intact, this link activated a test mode in    which the card contents were simply dumped to the    serial port. The TNO attack was to bridge the link with    two microprobes. At the last RSA conference, Tom    Rowley of National Semiconductor reported a similar    attack on an unnamed chip using an ion beam to    rewrite the link .

what Elvis cost, and a warning to all other exporters who
don't toe the line.
What is happening is that borderless government is developing

Lucky Green asked about judges of the FISA court, and

The Chief Judge of FISA is Royce Lambert, who gave talk on C-SPAN about the operation of the court at an ABA conference in D.C. a few months ago.
He made the point that few applications for electronic
surveillance are turned down by the court (of 8,000 applications 12 were denied) because the judges coach the applicants until they get a request right. And that the DoJ teams are quite adept at complying with the court's requirements, because all pass muster first of a special office set up for that purpose.
Judge Lambert said the job is "a lot of fun" because
its deals with supremely critical events of national
urgency, and that all the judges involved really do like it, especially the secrecy and prestige of being part of one of the most exclusive groups in Washington. This is not a joke.
Indeed, the Chief joked that the court's role "may be constitutional." And then said that he'll probably get in trouble for the statement.

There's considerable push coming from domestic law enforcement
agencies of many types and jurisdictions. See letters some of them have made in support of encryption controls in a House statement by Representative Weldon (co-sponsor with Dellums of the National Security Committee amendment to gut SAFE):
   These letters are regularly cited Freeh to show that the FBI and other
federal agencies are not alone in pushing for GAK, and to remind legislators that the law and order folks at home are a threat to re-election if they don't "give something to law enforcement."
And, Freeh often reminds that half of wiretaps are state rather than federal, as shown in the 1997 annual report on electronic surveillance:
   This is not to diminish the signficance of the burgeoning national security agencies, especially the 13 members of the intelligence community and those new-born aspirants for funds to protect the commonweal -- nearly every governmental jurisdiction now aims to grab a piece of the Nat Sec booty being converted to dual- and domestic-use, usually through various "justice" and "law enforcement" programs:
   An avid drumbeater for more funding for protection against the nation's high-tech enemies (thus bringing the foreign wars home) is the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (PCCIP). See a recent news report on PCCIP's call for $1 billion to fight the homefront foe:
   In short, there is a growing list of self-interested domestic parties who have a stake in GAK and you can bet they are leaning on their legislators just as hard as the federal briefers who whisper secrets
and lies celebrated this week for 50 years of domestic deception in the national interest.
Domestic controls on crypto and other munitions are just as certain to
come as the export kind, and for the same reasons -- security of the
state. If there are insufficient external enemies to justify stupendous public expenditures, why, just cook up the internal kind -- as done in the 1900s, the 1920s, the 1930s, the 40s, the 50s, the 60s, and to this day.

For answer to this consider:
There a number of countries who believe they are under just that
kind of Pearl harbor attack from the US through high-tech information warfare, electronic surveillance and related crypto control demands, especially the requirement for GAK in US and foreign-made products.
US leaders insistence that the US be 1st before all others in information technology, rightfully scares the shit out of our allies who
are distrusting the US more and more, perhaps even giving them
ideas about getting together with US enemies to beat back the Microsoft of nations. A counter-strike Pearl Harbor may be in the offing because of US belligerence and threat of Pearl Harboring others. (Recall the frequent invocation of this term by US reps, perhaps a clue to pre-emptive aggression in the works.)
The harping of US leaders on unidentified threats is making non-US
folks rather nervous, not being sure that the US may not turn on
its allies for the slightest of missteps or demurs, and cut off the
bountiful flow of global intel -- as the TLAs are now threatening Congressional committees. Crypto Czar Arons world consultations
were apparently thinly veiled threats to compel GAK compliance.

               SUPPLEMENTAL VIEWS OF HON. LORETTA SANCHEZ
    Many of us when we think of encryption imagine the
``ENIGMA'' code breaking machines of World War Two or the
American Indian ``code talkers'' that helped us anticipate and
defeat Nazi and Imperial Japanese attacks. Those methods were
mechanical or human-based, and often depended on simple
arithmetical slight of hand to trick the enemy. Today,
encryption is complex mathematical algorithms that have become
an entirely new branch of mathematics involving intense
academic study.
    Until recently encryption was limited to governments and
large companies through U.S. export limitations and by the
limitations of existing hardware and software technologies. All
that began to change as the desktop computer became more
prevalent and the computing power available to the average user
jumped by leaps and bounds every year. When discussing the
power of the PC observers of the information technology
industry often predict that the computing power of
microprocessors would double roughly every 18 months.
    Because of this the rapidly developing speed and growth of
computers, the age of the ``unbreakable code'' has long since
passed. Manufacturers of encryption technology are engaged in a
rapidly accelerating race to develop the newest and strongest
code that can withstand attacks from the increasingly powerful
computers of the day. And it isn't just big companies and
governments that have the technology to break codes. Last
January, a graduate student broke a 40-bit code in just three-
and-a-half hours, the toughest code form American companies at
the time were allowed to export.
    Today, American companies are the world leaders in
encryption technology, but other companies and nations are
catching up. Strong encryption products and knowledge about the
science of cryptography is not limited to the United States. A
savvy computer user anywhere in the world can with just a few
clicks of the mouse find U.S. export-embargoed encryption. Many
freelancing code hackers maintain off-shore Internet meeting
sites to discuss the newest holes in encryption products.
    The proposed export controls which the Administration
argues helps to keep strong encryption out of the hands of
foreign adversaries will have little or no effect. Strong
encryption is available abroad and US companies are being put
at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace.
    With this bleak and seemingly hopeless picture in mind how
do we protect ourselves from the threat of rogue nations and
other adversaries cloaking their communications from American
National Security efforts? The only viable solution is through
supporting a robust and aggressively competitive cryptography
industry in the United States. We must ensure that the United
States continues to maintain the deepest pool of cryptographic
experts in the world. American export limitations will only
serve to create a brain drain of these precious resources as
leading scientists leave our shores for more lucrative and
accommodating surroundings.
    All of us care about our national security and no one wants
to make it any easier for criminals and terrorists to commit
criminal acts. But we must also recognize encryption
technologies as an increasingly sharp double-edged sword. It
can also aid law enforcement and protect national security by
limiting the threat of industrial espionage and foreign spying,
but only when Americans are able to produce the sharpest swords
and the strongest encryption.
    I would also like to state for the record that for the
reasons stated above, I do not support the Dellums-Weldon
Amendment to H.R. 695, and would have voted against it.
                                                   Loretta Sanchez.

Lucky Green wrote about banning lapdancing on the Senate floor:
Banning laptops continues a long tradition of congressional
resistance to technology, the Senate moreso than the House.
The Architect of the Capitol, an office as well as a person, has to deal with a heritage of Luddites who have resisted, as examples,
removal of cuspidors; installing women's facilities of all sorts: putting in air-conditioning (mechanical ventilation as well as cooling), electric lights, subterranean trams, elevators, smoke alarms, telephones!, telegraphs, electro-mechanical quorum and roll calls (bells, lights and pagers!), wheelchairs (just recently), and more -- virtually every invention has been delayed in the Capitol, along with compliance with the laws imposed on the country but not on hallowed halls.
Ex-AoCs sometimes leak the stupifying arguments the solons make for maintaining their supposedly superior lifestyles free of demanding gadgetry and popular fad: their preference is for human servants over devices in order
to maintian deniability, for while flesh and blood is what the beasts know best how to cajole, seduce and terrorize it is also the reason they remain ever ready for betrayal
and opportunistic one-night-stand switching of lifetime fidelity.
Blinking, recording, error-archiving, machines scare the shit out of the the fork-tongue power-aphrodisiacal nymphomaniacs, not to say that the rest of us would act so differently given a seat in inner circles of jerks getting lapdanced on a magic carpet -- who wants that in the National Archives of Perfidy?
Often the reason folks oppose new technology is that it threatens
their network of operations based on old technology, as the
case with encryption.
Still, it's worth considering what leaked Senate plaintext (gov, pol, illicit)  would induce the secrecy-obsessed senators to support strong crypto for their own privacy of stashed wealth and squelched Paulas?
Often new technology is resisted because that it threatens
networks of successful operations of barely legal scams based on old technology, as the case with encryption, tv, radio, telephone, telegraph, printing, highways, roads, trails, stars, evil eyes, body stench, intuition, fear, mother's milk, amniotic warmth, egg and dart, downhole non-existence.
To be sure, there are disclosures of red-faced liaisons, the sort
recorded in hallowed halls and red-flocked boudoirs, that the TLAs (mirroring the KGB) may be threatening Congress with, in the eye-opening publications of Kalliste. See:

   Secrets: The CIA's War At Home
   Angus Mackenzie
   University of California Press
   Berkeley, 1997. 241 pp. $27.50
   ISBN 0-520-20020-9
"Secrets" decribes the origination of the Freedom of Information Act and other legislation to make government secrets available, the battles to get the laws passed and to defend them against subsequent attacks by proponents of secrecy who invoke the National Security Act.
Mackenzie sets out the ways the intelligence industry, helped by
the Department of Justice and the courts, manipulates the media, other governmental agencies and the citizenry by force and by seduction, with special attention to how it coopts its ostensible opponents like the ACLU and investigative journalists.
He documents the undisclosed arrangments between the CIA and the
media to favor journalism at the public's expense in legislation and
in working relations.
He carefully traces the long-running campaign to limit governmental employees from revealing what they know through various non-disclosure and lifetime secrecy agreements, sometimes breached
by ex-agency heads who reveal secrets to boost careers.
The book amply documents the ongoing struggle, now 50 years
underway, to open the archives of domestic spying, new attempts to limit public access to governmental information, and moves to invade privacy.
Here are the book's closing paragraphs:
   By the 1990s, reflecting the general conservative shift in
   Congress, many House members were actively welcoming a
   secrecy oath. Consideration of the oath, less comprehensive
   than the standard contract, first came up in the House Select
   Committee on Intelligence during a discussion of the fiscal year
   (FY) 1992 Intelligence Authorization Act. That led to a House
   rule requiring the intelligence committee members and staff to
   sign the oath. Interest in broadening the use of the oath did not
   stop there, especially for committee member Porter J. Goss of
   Florida. Goss's ties to the CIA dated from 1962 and his ten year
   stint as a clandestine service officer at the Agency. He and his
   fellow enthusiast, Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, offered amendments
   to the FY 1993 and 1994 authorization acts that would require
   secrecy oaths from every member of the House. The
   amendments did not prosper, but when the 104th Congress
   convened on January 4, 1995, backers of the oath changed
   tactics. This time the oath requirement for every House member
   was included in the packet of rules from the House Conference
   of the Majority. It became a new rule without debate.
   In the mid-1980s, Jeane Kirkpatrick sounded the alarm about
   government censorship. Although a member of the Reagan
   administration's inner foreign policy circle, Kirkpatrick had a
   personal encounter with government censors over her refusal to
   sign the lifetime secrecy contract. Upon returning to her political
   science chair at Georgetown University from her post as U.S.
   United Nations ambassador, Kirkpatrick reexamined John Stuart
   Mill's classic essay On Liberty and delivered a lecture on
   censorship. "Societies are not made stronger by the process of
   repression that accompanies censorship," she warned.
   "Censorship requires an assumption of infallibility, and that
   seems to Mill invariably negative. Repression of an opinion is
   thus bad for the censor, who inevitably acts from a conviction of
   his own infallibility," she told her students, "and bad for the
   opinion itself, which can neither be corrected nor held with
   conviction equal to the strength of an opinion submitted to
   challenge."
   As the twentieth century draws to a close, the 1947 National
   Security Act has become the Pandora's box that Ambassador
   Kirkpatrick and Congressman Hoffman had feared. Placing a
   legal barrier between foreign intelligence operations and
   domestic politics in the National Security Act has proved
   ineffectual. In the decades that followed 1947, the CIA not only
   became increasingly involved in domestic politics but abridged
   First Amendment guarantees of free speech and free press in a
   conspiracy to keep this intrusion from the American people. The
   intelligence and military secrecy of the 1940s had broadened in
   the 1960s to covering up the suppression of domestic dissent.
   The 1980s registered a further, more fundamental change, as
   the suppression of unpopular opinions was supplemented by
   systematic and institutionalized peacetime censorship for the
   first time in U.S. history. The repressive machinery developed by
   the CIA has spread secrecy like oil on water.
   The U.S. government has always danced with the devil of
   secrecy during wartime. By attaching the word "war" to the
   economic and ideological race for world supremacy between
   the Soviet Union and the United States, a string of
   administrations continued this dance uninterrupted for fifty
   years. The cold war provided the foreign threat to justify the
   pervasive Washington belief that secrecy should have the
   greatest possible latitude and openness should be restricted as
   much as possible -- constitutional liberties be damned.
   With the collapse of the Soviet Union as a world power in 1990,
   even the pseudo-war rationale evaporated. But the partisans of
   secrecy have not been willing to accept the usual terms of
   peacetime. They have made clear their intentions to preserve
   and extend the wartime system. They will find a rationalization: if
   not the threat of the Soviet Union, then the goal of economic
   hegemony. Thus the U.S. government now needs to keep
   secrets to give an advantage to American corporate interests.
   Yet it is entrepreneurs who have been making the most use of
   FOIA -- not journalists, not lawyers. As of 1994, the great
   preponderance of all FOIA requests have been for business
   purposes. As the framers of the Constitution understood, the
   free exchange of ideas is good for commerce, but this idea has
   been widely forgotten in the years since the passage of the 1947
   National Security Act.
   Only recently in the history of the world's oldest republic has
   secrecy functioned principally to keep the American people in
   the dark about the nefarious activities of their government. The
   United States is no longer the nation its citizens once thought: a
   place, unlike most others in the world, free from censorship and
   thought police, where people can say what they want, when they
   want to, about their government. Almost a decade after the end
   of the cold war, espionage is not the issue, if it ever really was.
   The issue is freedom, as it was for the Minute Men at Compo
   Hill. The issue is principle, as it was for Ernest Fitzgerald, who
   never signed a secrecy contract but retained his Pentagon job
   because he made his stand for the First Amendment resonate in
   Congress. Until the citizens of this land aggressively defend
   their First Amendment rights of free speech, there is little hope
   that the march to censorship will be reversed. The survival of
   the cornerstone of the Bill of Rights is at stake.

Excerpt from Congressional Record, April 2, 1998:
WAKE-UP CALL ON ENCRYPTION
  Mr. LEAHY. In my view, encryption legislation should promote the following goals:
  First, legislation should ensure the right of Americans to choose how to protect the privacy and security of their communications and information;
  Second, legislation should bar a government-mandated key escrow encryption system;
  Third, legislation should establish both procedures and standards for access by law enforcement to decryption keys or decryption assistance for both encrypted communications and stored electronic information and only permit such access upon court order authorization, with appropriate notice and other procedural safeguards;
  Fourth, legislation should establish both procedures and standards for access by foreign governments and foreign law enforcement agencies to the plaintext of encrypted communications and stored electronic information of United States persons;
  Fifth, legislation should modify the current export regime for encryption to promote the global competitiveness of American companies;
  Sixth, legislation should not link the use of certificate authorities with key recovery agents or, in other words, link the use of encryption for confidentiality purposes with use of encryption for authenticity and integrity purposes;
  Seventh, legislation should, consistent with these goals of promoting privacy and the global competitiveness of our high-
tech industries, help our law enforcement agencies and national security agencies deal with the challenges posed by the use of encryption; and
  Eighth, legislation should protect the security and privacy of information provided by Americans to the government by ensuring that encryption products used by the government interoperate with commercial encryption products.
  Do you agree with these goals?
  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, I agree with these goals and will look to these same items as a reference point for the drafting, introducing and passage of encryption reform legislation.
  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator agree to work with me on encryption legislation that achieves these goals and that we could bring to the floor this Congress?
  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes. I believe it is critical for us to address this issue and soon. I also believe that we should work together to produce a piece of legislation that demonstrates our position on encryption policy.

Ars Electronica Festival 98 INFOWAR - information. macht. krieg.
7. - 12.9.1998
Linz, Austria
Presse - Information [Excerpts]
20.3.1998 Ars Electronica, one of the world's most highly-acclaimed festivals at the interface of art, technology and society, has been presented annually since 1979. INFOWAR, the title of this year's festival, places the strategies of data-supported wars - from the Gulf Conflict to the skirmishes of cyberguerillas - into the focal point of artistic as well as
theoretical and scientific interest, to thereby shed light on the internal logic of the information society in connection with war. Numerous events, installations, network projects, performances and a symposium make up the festival's program to confront and deal with this subject. Symposium INFOWAR
September 8 - 9, 1998 New weapons systems and military strategies will not exclusively occupy the middle point of these discussions. The aim is to elaborate on "information as a strategic weapon," the power of the media as political power, the new potential hot spots of conflict and new images of "enemy" in an information society characterized by global economic and financial markets. But this also has to do with hacker myths, cryptography, electronic bugging operations, and the serious concerns regarding national security versus private citizens' fears of the complete loss of the right of privacy. This symposium will deploy works of art and artistic responsibility as methods for coming to terms with these issues and achieving increased sensibility toward them. The information society - no longer a vague promise of a better future, but a reality and a central challenge of the here-and-now
- is founded upon the three key technologies of electricity,
telecommunications and computers: Technologies developed for the purposes, and out of the logic, of war, technologies of simultaneity and coherence, keeping our civilian society in a state of permanent mobilisation driven by the battle for markets, resources and spheres of influence. A battle for supremacy in processes of economic concentration, in which the fronts, no longer drawn up along national boundaries and between political systems, are defined by technical standards. A battle in which the power of knowledge is managed as a profitable monopoly of its distribution and dissemination. The latest stock market upheavals have laid bare the power of a global market, such as only the digital revolution could have fathered, and which must be counted as the latterï¿½s most widely-felt
direct outcome. The digitally-networked market of today wields more power than the politicians. Governments are losing their say in the international value of their currencies; they can no longer control, but only react. The massive expansion of freely-accessible
communication networks, itself a global economic necessity, imposes severe constraints on the arbitrary restriction of information flows. Any transgression of a critical control functions in the cybertechnologiesï¿½ sphere of responsibility and influence puts central power wielders in a hitherto unheard-of position of vulnerability and openness to attack. The geographic frontiers of the industrial age are increasingly losing their erstwhile significance in global politics, and giving way to vertical fronts along social stratifications. Whereas, in the past, war was concerned with the conquering of territory, and later with the control of production capacities, war in the 21st century is entirely concerned with the acquisition
and exercise of power over knowledge. The three fronts of land, sea and air battles have been joined by a fourth, being set up within the global information systems. Spurred on by the "successes" of the Gulf war, the development of information warfare is running at full speed. Increasingly, the attention of the military strategists is turning away from computer-aided warfare - from potentiation of the destructive efficiency of military operations through the
application of information technology, virtual reality and high-tech weaponry - to cyberwar, whose ultimate target is nothing less than the global information infrastructure itself: annihilation of the enemyï¿½s computer and communication systems, obliteration of his databases, destruction of his command and control systems. Yet increasingly the vital significance of the global information infrastructure for the functioning of the international finance markets compels the establishment of new strategic objectives: not obliteration, but manipulation, not destruction, but infiltration and assimilation. "Netwar" as the tactical deployment of information and disinformation, targeted at human understanding. These new forms of post-territorial conflicts, however, have for some time now ceased to be preserve of governments and their ministers of war. NGOs, hackers, computer freaks in the service of organised crime, and terrorist organisations with high-tech expertise are now the chief actors in the cyberguerilla nightmares of national security services and defence ministries. In 1998, under the banner of "INFO WAR", the Ars Electronica Festival of Art, Technology and Society, is appealing to artists, theoreticians and technologists for contributions relating to the social and political definition of the information society. The emphasis here will lie not on technological flights of fancy, but on the fronts drawn up in a society that is in a process of fundamental and violent upheaval.

and jaded journalists.  This is a secure cell phone.  Lieutenant General
Kenneth Minihan, Director of the National Security Agency, presented
Secretary Albright with a bank of Motorola Cipher-Tac 2000 security
modules to provide secure cellular communications.
This state of the art secure voice cellular technology will offer the
highest level of security wherever and whenever the Secretary and her
top advisors need to protect their communications.  So when you see us
carrying this beast around, rather than the slim-line phones we usually
like to use, you'll know that's because we're trying to have a secure
call.  That is not only for the obvious good reason that we want to make
sure nobody is interfering, but we also want to make sure that nobody is
making transcripts and passing them around for a variety of perfidious

Motorola's site is informative (thanks for the pointers and comments), and perhaps cannot reveal the detail needed to compare security level to other systems in the US and other countries. Dave Emery probes the tech questions a bit and I'll go further, with Adam Shostack and others, to ask as a citizen why we cannot purchase the level of cell phone privacy that our gov and mil folks can with our money (a return to the NSA-crippled algo of CMEA and CAVE).
There has been some discussion of this on UK Crypto about
the various telco security systems in Europe and the same
critique of a double standard has been made. Cell phone
manufacturers would have a big stake in who gets the best
security to the global public first.
Moreover, as Scientific American points out in its special
section this month, applications of wireless technology are rapidly growing for a host of new information distribution,
collection and interactive purposes. The need for security
of this data floating through the spectrum could hardly
be greater, not only for privacy but for prtoection against tampering, insertion of disinformation, and a variety of new ways to warp data to fit schemes the owners and originators never dreamed of. Is end to end encryption of the STU-III sort going to be needed for all wireless or are there other plans in the works
at TLAs and TIAs?
It would be greatly appreciated if those who may be
tongue-tied by NDA and worse, if we were pointed in the
right direction by, say, semaphore, to the likely places
where we can dig out, say, by FOIA, what we need to know about Albright-privileged wireless security.
Finally, are the TAC-2000 units useful for the Secretary's
global travels? If so, are they supported by military networks overseas? Or do American officials use a different system
when traveling?

   Researchers Crack Code In Cell Phones       Weakened Encryption Raises Security Concern    By John Markoff
   San Francisco, April 13 -- In successfully cracking a
   widely used encryption method designed to prevent the
   cloning of digital cellular phones, a group of University
   of California computer researchers believe they have
   stumbled across evidence that the system was deliberately
   weakened to permit Government surveillance.
   The method that was cracked is known as G.S.M., for the
   Groupe Speciale Mobile standard. The world's most widely
   used encryption system for cellular phones, G.S.M. is
   employed in about 80 million of the devices worldwide and
   by as many as two million phones in the United States.
   Most of the 58 million American analog and digital cell
   phones are based on a variety of other methods, but 20
   American cellular phone companies, including Pacific Bell,
   a unit of SBC Communications Inc., and the Omnipoint
   Corporation, use the G.S.M. standard.
   Two researchers at the University of California at Berkeley
   announced today that they had successfully broken the
   G.S.M. method by using a computer to determine a secret
   identity number stored in the Subscriber Identity Module,
   or S.I.M., a credit card-like device inside the phone.
   If criminals were to crack the method, they could "clone"
   phones protected by G.S.M. encryption -- that is, detect a
   phone's number and use it in another phone to fraudulently
   bill calls. However, both the researchers and cellular
   telephone company officials said today that the cloning
   threat was extremely remote compared with the vulnerability
   of analog cellular phones.
   For one thing, they said, cracking G.S.M. had required
   almost 10 hours of electronic probing and high-powered
   computing.
   What was even more intriguing than the security threat,
   however, was that cracking the code yielded a tantalizing
   hint that a digital key used by G.S.M. may have been
   intentionally weakened during the design process to permit
   Government agencies to eavesdrop on cellular telephone
   conversations.
   Although the key, known as A5, is a 64-bit encryption
   system -- generally an extremely difficult code to crack --
   the researchers determined that the last 10 digits were
   actually zeros. That means that with the powerful computers
   available to national intelligence agencies, it would be
   possible to decode a voice conversation relatively quickly,
   said Marc Briceno, director of the Smartcard Developers
   Association, a small programmers organization.
   "It appears the key was intentionally weakened," he said.
   "I can't think of any other reason for what they did."
   For years, the computer industry has been rife with rumors
   about encryption designers having been persuaded or forced
   by Government spy agencies to mathematically weaken
   communications security systems or to install secret
   backdoors. Some of the rumors even have the National
   Security Agency or the Central Intelligence Agency posing
   as cryptographers, designing the encryption programs
   themselves and then releasing them -- all to insure that
   they could decode data or phone conversations.
   Such rumors are fed, in part, by the hazy origins of the
   G.S.M. system. Industry cryptographic experts said that the
   underlying mathematical formulas, or algorithms, in
   G.S.M.'s encryption design were thought to have originated
   in either Germany or France as part of the creation of the
   standard in 1986 and 1987.
   But other than today's hint of an intentionally weakened
   system, little evidence has ever emerged to support
   speculation, and the researchers' suspicions were not
   universally endorsed.
   "It's possible there are other reasons for doing this,"
   Stewart Baker, a Washington lawyer who was formerly a
   lawyer for the National Security Agency, said. The N.S.A.
   is one of the agencies most often suspected of such schemes
   because a major part of its mission is to intercept
   telephone calls.
   "Speculation is easy, and it never dies," Mr. Baker said.
   Even so, most industry experts could think of no good
   reason why an encryption algorithm key would be
   intentionally shortened, other than to facilitate
   surveillance.
   "This was deliberately weakened," said Phil Karn, an
   engineer at Qualcomm Inc., a cellular telephone
   manufacturer that has developed an alternative standard to
   G.S.M. "Who do you think would be interested in doing
   something like this?"
   The weakened key was discovered by two researchers, Ian
   Goldberg and David Wagner, both members of the University
   of California at Berkeley's Internet Security Applications,
   Authentication and Cryptography Group, with the aid of Mr.
   Briceno. They stressed that they had easily detected the
   security flaw that could make digital cellular phones
   vulnerable to cloning.
   Cloning has been a costly fraud problem for.many years. But
   digital phones are widely believed to be immune from
   cloning. In San Francisco, Pacific Bell's billboard
   advertisements depict a sheep and a cell phone and boast
   that of the two only the cell phone cannot be cloned.
   Cellular telephone industry executives acknowledged the
   flaw in G.S.M. but said it actually reinforced their claims
   about the security of digital telephones.
   "My hat goes off to these guys they did some great work,"
   said George Schmitt, president of Omnipoint. "I'll give
   them credit, but we're not at any risk of fraud."
   The researchers and the Smartcard Developers Association
   said that the successful attack was new evidence of the
   shortcomings of a widespread industry practice of keeping
   security techniques hidden from public review. Real
   security, they argue, requires publication of the
   algorithms so that independent experts can verify the
   strength of the systems.
   "This shows yet again a failure of a closed design
   process," Mr. Briceno said. "These companies pride
   themselves on their security, but now the chickens are
   coming home to roost."

Ramparts in 1972 was indeed the starting point.   Sadly, many subsequent
reporters later confused what "Winslow Peck" [= Perry (not Peter) Fellwock,
which *is* his true name]  wrote about "keyword" interception of
international telephony traffic.  The story from then on ..
Early in 1976, Winslow came to London.  I interviewed him at length and
then carried out my own research on GCHQ.  I then published an article in
Time Out, June 1976, called the Eavesdroppers which did for GCHQ and the UK
what Winslow did for NSA and the US.    My co-author was another American
journalist, a Time Out staffer called Mark Hosenball.
The Eavesdroppers was the first (and full) description of what GCHQ was and
did.   There had been no previous article, although World In Action had
attempted a programme in 1972.
GCHQ's directors were apoplectic.  The more so because the combined efforts
of the GPO (who tapped my phone from May 76 onwards), the Special Branch
and MI5 (who followed MH and me around) revealed that we had actually got
the article out *without* breaking the Official Secrets Act.   I had done
my research from open technical sources, and (!) telephone directories;
Peck, as an American wasn't covered by the British law.  But they got even.   Hosenball, an American, was declared a threat to
national security and deported.   Philip Agee, the famous whistleblower
from the CIA, was added in to the deportation list.
Seven months later, I *was* arrested in the furore over their deportations
together with another Time Out reporter, Crispin Aubrey.   We had talked to
a former British sigint operator, John Berry.   The case became known as
"ABC" after our initials.   Over the coming two years, I was accused of
having too much information and faced two counts of espionage as well as
one of breaching section 2 of the Official Secrets Act (a law which was
repealed almost ten years ago now).   These counts totalled a potential
sentence of 30 years imprisonment.   At Court 1 in the Old Bailey in October 1978, this disgaceful prosecution -
which marked the high water point of MI5's manic campaigns against
"internal subversion" - fell apart.   The story has just recently been told
in the delightful autobiography of Geoff Robertson QC, who was then my no 2
lawyer.  His book is called "The Justice Game".    Maybe its time for me
own autobio ...
Mrs Thatcher put GCHQ firmly on the world map with the union ban, 5 years
later.   And now ...

   Commerce Secretary Seeks Compromise on Encryption
     Administration Reconsiders F.B.I. Position
   By Jeri Clausing
   Washington, April 15 -- The Clinton Administration's attempts to
   control encryption technology have been a failure and are forcing
   American software makers to concede ground to foreign
   competitors, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said today.
   Mr. Daley's remarks, made in a speech here to the high-technology
   industry, were the strongest indication yet that the
   Administration was seriously considering parting ways with Louis
   Freeh, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and
   other law enforcement and spy agencies over the issue of how data
   should be scrambled.
   "We are headed down a lose-lose path, and we have to get back to
   win-win," Mr. Daley said. He blamed both industry and law
   enforcement officials for the failed policy, saying that the two
   sides had failed to find a reasonable compromise between the need
   to monitor the activities of criminals and the need to offer
   consumers strong security for on-line transactions.
   The purpose of his speech today was to release the Commerce
   Department's first comprehensive report on the impact of
   electronic commerce on the nation's economy. The report shows
   that information technology, including business on the Internet,
   is growing twice as fast as the overall economy, employing some
   7.4 million workers at salaries 64 percent above the national
   average.
   But while the report was full of impressive numbers and glowing
   predictions for the future, Mr. Daley said that strong encryption
   and a solid encryption policy were essential if electronic
   commerce was to realize its full potential.
   Mr. Daley's blunt comments marked the first public acknowledgment
   that the Clinton Administration's encryption policy had failed.
   And his remarks echoed what the industry has contended for years
   -- that foreign companies are fast taking over the high-demand
   market for products that protect the privacy of communications.
   The software industry is currently prohibited from exporting
   strong encryption programs, which scramble data in ways that make
   it difficult or impossible for unauthorized people -- including
   law enforcement agencies -- to decode. Such software is essential
   to electronic commerce, which requires that credit card
   information and other private data be encrypted when products are
   ordered on the Internet.
   The software industry has long argued that the export rules put
   American companies at a great disadvantage relative to foreign
   competitors not under such restrictions. Mr. Freeh and the
   National Security Agency argue that the threat of terrorists and
   other criminals scrambling data to thwart law enforcement is so
   great that the export restrictions should be removed only if the
   police are given keys to unlock encrypted data.
   At the end of 1997, Mr. Daley said, an estimated 656 encryption
   products were being produced in 29 countries outside the United
   States. Products from Germany, Ireland, Canada, Israel and
   Britain can compete with anything made domestically, he said, and
   can meet the needs of the world's computer networks.
   "Our policy, ironically, encourages the growth of foreign
   producers at the same time it retards growth here," Mr. Daley
   said. He called for a sincere dialogue between industry and law
   enforcement, but stopped short of saying that the Administration
   would withdraw its support of the F.B.I. and N.S.A. position.
   "There are solutions out there," Mr. Daley said. "Solutions that
   would meet some of law enforcement's needs without compromising
   the concerns of the privacy and business communities. But I fear
   our search has thus far been more symbolic than sincere.
   "The cost of our failure will be high. The ultimate result will
   be foreign dominance of the market. This means a loss of jobs
   here, and products that do not meet either our law-enforcement or
   national security needs."
   Mr. Daley declined to offer examples of what the Administration
   might be willing to give up to reach an agreement.
   Industry officials, however, said there was no room for
   compromise.
   "People want complete privacy," Peter F. McCloskey of the
   Electronic Industries Alliance said.
   Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology
   Association of America, said that companies were willing to
   continue discussions with the Administration, but he asserted
   that Government officials "think compromise is something in the
   middle; sometimes compromise is found outside of the box."
   Mr. Miller said that the solution needed to be a technical one,
   perhaps one that gave law enforcement better training and
   equipment to crack encrypted criminal communications without
   requiring that everyone hand over spare keys to their computer
   files.
   "Law enforcement has legitimate concerns," Mr. Harris said. "What
   we disagree with is their demand for unlimited access."

Ok, here it is (the largest attachment I've done so far ;-) [See end]
Here is the skinny....
IRS is going to award the contract for its Y2K remediation
sometime in October, which is of course a joke.  By most
estimates they have on the order of 100million lines of
code to fix, much of it flakey and undocumented.  Any
Autocoder programmers left?  Anyway, the CIO of the
IRS quit recently and this file (prime.pdf) was his plea
for help before he left and bought gold or something.
If you go to the IRS page that Gary North references
this document is just plain gone.  Its extremely telling
if you look at the data flow diagrams for IRS administrative
systems.  Its so huge that a I had to zoom in 4 or 5 times
before subsystem names started to resolve.  I downloaded this
when it was posted because after reading it I knew someone
would eventually yank it.
PS: Some quick math: 100 million lines of code/1 million
lines per year = 100 years to fix.  1 million lines
per year is how fast the Social (in)Security Administration
was able to fix their code and even they won't be
compliant.  ;-)

More on the future of money in the NYT today, "Crime's New Cash of Choice," the Euro, which plans larger denominations than the mobs' favorite $100 US. If the Euro catches on, it says, the USG could lose billions in interest-free loans on stashed C-notes, unused except in the underground -- which the US turns a blind tax eye to because more revenue comes from the seignoriage.
      On competing millenarist doomsaying, the NYT has on page one a report on an exercise last month which revealed how ill-prepared the US is to handle a germ attack, with PDDs coming shortly to address anti-terrorism (with a Czar), and the squabbles among competing agencies for intel fed shock scenarios leading to terrific stockpiles of money antidotes, preferrably all non-fictional, but not likely since the report says that the PDD the President gets aroused at is Richard Preston's "The Cobra Event" -- sold out for miles around the bunkers'

points of note:
IBM recently made a "snapshot" of the entire worldwide Web,
eight trillion bytes of data, for an experimental database for searching and unnamed other manipulation by its quantum computers. Searching the database for a word by conventional computers would take a month, while quantum devices could
do it in 27 minutes, a Beamer says.
NSA is funding quantum computing at Los Alamos specifically
for cryptographic investigation, "because QC could have
a profound effect on modern cryptography."
Others forms of warp speed snooping are discussed as well.
"Snow Crash" is featured in a hot-selling book on the thought
of the American Left, "Achieving Our Country," by philosopher
Richard Rorty. The book is swell reading on the state of US
thought, culture and politics whatever your disagreeable attitude. It's smallish, but for those completely broke and open to copyleft, grab it before IBM kicks it offshore:

The Secretariat of The Wassenaar Arrangement has issued
brief public docs on the recent meeting:
   Only one brief mention of encryption:
     "8. The WA agreed control list amendments to take into account   recent technological developments. The amendments to the lists   included elimination of coverage of commonly available civil   telecommunications equipment as well as the modernisation of   encryption controls to keep pace with developing technology and   electronic commerce, while also being mindful of security interests.   Participating States also discussed the potential need for the WA   and national export control authorities to respond quickly and   effectively to the emergence of new technologies."
Which appears to confirm that each state will implement and
announce its encryption policy as it sees fit. The US has jumped
to proclaim to its constituencies that it has won.
Though it's the secret agreements that remain to be publicized.

Since some time after the Department of Commerce issued the recent press release on Wassenaar the site ( has not been accessible, at least not from here.
The press release section of the International Trade

We spoke with a public affairs rep at DoC before this happened
and to inquire when the department would issue detailed information
to flesh out the press release. I said there was a furor over Aaron's spin, and much skepticism of its validity. She said she would check and call back but hasn't.

@_subject: AU WassenaarWassenaar changes 
[OK to repost to crypto lists and Cryptome - dant]
I spoke this afternoon with one of the Australian delegates at the
Wassenaar meeting, an official from the Dept of Foreign Affairs and Trade
Speaking off the record, they confirmed the changes at Wassenaar are pretty
much as we know already:
     - NEW CONTROLS on mass market crypto products (hardware and software);
     - DEREGULATING all weak encryption products using key lengths up to 56
     bits;
     - EXEMPTING mass market software where the key length is 64 bits or
     less;
     - EXTENDING the same mass market exemption to hardware for the first
     time;
     - EXCLUDING encryption products that protect intellectual property,
     such as digital watermarking;
     - NO DECISION was made about regulating 'intangible' distribution of
     technology, including Internet downloads.
Apparently in the short term the intangibles issue is being considered in
other fora (including the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) which includes
Australia thanks to Filthy Jabilucre et al).
It is still not clear whether the new restrictions are intended to stop
public domain software such as PGP*. The DFAT contact said there was no
discussion about an intention to stop public domain packages like PGP. They
did not think public domain was being restricted. Yet apparently the
Australian DoD has expressed the David Aaron view that public domain is
subject to the same restrictions as mass market.
* PGP is "in the public domain" for the purposes of Wassenaar/DSGL, since
the definition states:
     "in the public domain" (GTN NTN GSN), as it applies herein, means
     "technology" or "software" which has been made available without
     restrictions upon its further dissemination (copyright restrictions do
     not remove "technology" or "software" from being "in the public
     domain")
Note: there is no equivalent definition for "mass market", but the General
Software Note (GSN) states it thus:
     Generally available to the public by being:
        1. Sold from stock at retail selling points, without restriction,
        by means of:
          a. Over-the-counter transactions;
          b. Mail order transactions; or
          c. Telephone order transactions; and
        2. Designed for installation by the user without substantial
        support by the supplier;

@_subject: What was the quid pro quo for Wassenaar countries? 
Peter Gutmann may be close to the truth about Echelon's role
in the Wassenaar changes.
The NYT reports today that the US is proposing to NATO a
combined intelligence center to combat use of Weapons of Mass
Destruction by rogue states and non-state terrorists like Usama
Bin Laden.
There is some dissent among the Europeans over the US's
attempt to frighten the populace with a new worldwide menace
to replace the boogies of the Cold War.
Still, it appears that intelligence on the threat of terrorist use of WMD is being whispered in ears of those holding out for
privacy protection. And a correlative threat of strong encryption
is surely part of those scenarios.
As in the US, it's probable that domestic restrictions on strong
crypto are being advanced to combat domestic terrorism in countries
around the world, following the precedent set during the Cold War,
which, as we all know was the evil parent of Wassenaar's predecessor
GAO put out a report (GGD-99-7) a few days ago on the FBI's expenditures for counterterrorism from 1995-98. It shows a dramatic increase year by year, with big leaps authorized by Congress following each "terrorist incident," for funds for a host of domestic agencies. GAO wonders (as does Congress which asked for the report) if it's all being put to beneficial effect. Its description of CT activities
carefully excludes the classified, and also omits the global efforts of US military

Yes, Gilmore's proposal was to mirror the contents; URLs threaten

Yep, mirrors of everything would be very large. We've heard already
that folks would like help in knowing what to mirror if they can't do
large archives, or can't easily decide which are most important. My advice so far: mirror whatever you can until better advice comes forth. Prime need: many mirrors of the strongest stuff, especially anything above 40-bits, that is anything that now requires a US export license (which appears
to be where Wassenaar wildebeests and the domestic US is being stampeded).
What would help is a list from experts on what are the most gov-enraging programs. We'd like to offer a few of those on jya.com, to test BXA's up-and-

Response to a forward of John Gilmore's message to UK Crypto:
I would only add this caution.  I think John is wrong in giving legal advice that Wassenaar is not binding without implementing legislation.  That is an American approach to these matters. I believe that many, perhaps most, Wassenaar members derive their authority to regulate exports directly from the arrangement itself.  For that reason, I would not assume that everyone everywhere is free to ignore the new restrictions until some further law or regulation is promulgated.

Excerpt from a speech by BXA's William Reinsch on December 7, 1998, at the Practising Law Institute conference "Coping with U.S.
Export Controls." Note final paragraph about detailed crypto session today -- no report on that yet.
Full speech: Also by him yesterday on crypto: [Begin excerpt]
Encryption continues to be a hotly debated issue. As I stated last
year, the U.S. continues to support a balanced approach to encryption
policy which considers privacy and commercial interests as well as
protecting law enforcement and national security interests.
Furthermore, we also remain committed to promoting the growth of
global electronic commerce through secure financial and business
Our position has always been to seek industry-led, market-driven
solutions to achieve a balanced approach. What has changed is the
direction where technology and the market place are taking us. Key
recovery technology remains a very important part of our policy;
however, over the past two years, we have recognized that key recovery
is not a solution for all problems.
That recognition, brought about in part as a result of our ongoing
dialogue with industry, has helped us also focus on recoverable
technologies that can enable law enforcement to continue its
authorized activities.
As a result, on September 16, Vice President Gore unveiled a policy
update, which will not end the debate, but which does include steps to
further streamline exports of key recovery products and other
recoverable products which allow law enforcement, under proper legal
authority, recovery of plain text.
The update also provides for 1) the export of 56 bit DES worldwide to
any end user under a license exception; 2) exports of strong
encryption to U.S. companies and their subsidiaries under a license
exception; 3) exports of strong encryption to the insurance and
medical sectors in 45 countries under a license exception; and 4)
exports of strong encryption to secure on-line transactions between
on-line merchants and their customers in 45 countries under a license
exception. This is consistent with our earlier announcement relating
to financial institutions.
This is an evolutionary process and we intend to continue our
dialogue. We must continue to adapt to changes, and we will review our policies again within the year to determine whether further change is necessary. We intend to publish regulations implementing the Vice President's announcement this month.
With respect to developing a common international approach to
encryption policy, Ambassador David Aaron, our special envoy on
cryptography, is working with other countries to ensure that our
policies are compatible. He has found that most major producing
countries have public safety and national security concerns similar to ours and are interested in developing a harmonized international
approach regarding compatible infrastructures for electronic commerce
and for a key management infrastructure. At last week's Wassenaar
Arrangement plenary session, the participating states approved a
number of changes to modernize and improve multilateral encryption
export controls. These changes removed controls on products below 56 bits and on certain consumer entertainment systems, such as DVD
products, and on cordless phone systems designed for home or office
Most important, participating states agreed to extend controls to
mass-market encryption exports above 64 bits, thus closing a
significant loophole. This will enable governments to review the
dissemination of the strongest encryption products that otherwise
might fall into the hands of rogue end users.
For those of you deeply interested in the details of our encryption
policy, we have a specific session devoted to it tomorrow.

@_subject: LEA Interviews 
This is attorney protected information.
We've been having discussion with a legal person about being
interviewed by law enforcement officials and/or signing a statement. These comments are offered by permission (and might be coupled with DCF's advice of saying only "I Want a Lawyer"):
[Begin comments]
Sorry to be opaque - "impeachment" means, basically, making a witness lose credibility with the jury. The only use I've been able to imagine for wanting a written statement is to make you look bad, in the event that you are called by either side to testify, and end up testifying favorably to the defendant. If you
appear to be a "hostile witness", it's even possible that you can be impeached by the attorney/party who asked you to testify.
The scenario I see looks something like this - 1.	You're called as a defense witness to testify to the effect that you've been on the list for years, messages like the
defendants's weren't unique or especially unusual, that you understood them as satire or political commentary and not as actual threats, given the wider context in which they occurred. The general impression conveyed by your testimony is that you're a rational, reasonable, respectable person who the jury can like and trust, that you think the defendant is perhaps weird but basically misunderstood and harmless. 2.	The prosecution cross-examines you about your conclusions re the defendant - they're going to ask you how well you really knew/know him, how much you knew about his other behavior (they're likely to try to sneak in information about the defendant's other alleged misbehavior here, if they haven't already), and so forth. To the extent that you say you didn't know him, your direct testimony becomes less and less relevant - and if you start to
say that you did know him well, they're likely to produce the document you wrote/signed, and ask you a series of uncomfortable questions about it, designed to create the impression you were lying to the jury earlier during your testimony, e.g., if the statement says "I didn't know that the defendant had done these other creepy things, and they make me question whether or not I
know him very well, and I feel differently about his threats now that I know about those creepy things", the prosecutor will make a big production out of pointing out the differences between your testimony at trial and what you wrote during the LEA interrogation. Understandably, you probably wanted to distance yourself from the defendant when the LE agents were in your home, especially after they'd given you a list of creepy things he supposedly did - but they're going to hold you to the same degree of distance from him and his thoughts/actions if you end up testifying at trial. Writing it down and having you sign it serves several purposes - it gives the prosecutor a document s/he can wave around, ask you to read from, and otherwise organize a little production around - it also lets you be impeached with your own words, instead of calling the cops to the stand to dispute your recollection of your conversation, which takes on a "he said/she said" tone, and might make it look like the big mean cops were picking on poor
little you. If they can make poor little you eat his own words, they look good, and you look bad.
So .. that's what I'm afraid the document is for. I've been trying to think of something else - but especially where the agents asked you to pick out just key bits of your conversation, and assert that they're true, and let the rest of the information be lost to memory and time .. it makes me think the information they selected was important to them. The information they got seems helpful to them only in the context that you end up testifying at trial - I can't think of any other reason it would be useful to them. It sounds like the psychological factors of the questioning were pretty well
optimized to make you want (probably partly subconsciously) to distance yourself from the defendant, both to avoid implied guilt by association, and to maintain a common ground of reasonableness with the cops while discussing other things like politics. The current issue of the Utne Reader has a piece by the Unabomber's brother and his wife talking about how the FBI manipulated them into providing evidence against the Unabomber by appearing
sympathetic and reasonable, forming a common "us (good people) versus the actions of they crazy guy, who needs us to work together to help him get better" bond which was ultimately used to try to kill the crazy guy, to the horror of the brother/wife. While I do think that they may have pulled a fast one on you, I don't think that reflects badly on you as a person .. it's pretty difficult to tell which cops are actually reasonable people, and which are pretending to be reasonable people in order to further their own agendas.

The Wash Post today has picked up the hot European
story of NSA's file on Princess Diana and linked it to
the NSA's Echelon program.
   This is the first US major media story on Echelon, and its
connection to privacy invasion of a global celebrity icon may do more to get public attention for the vile program
than any previous investigation and report.
NSA claims Diana was not a "target" and that the 1,000 pages
of data on her were gathered "incidental" to other activities. But, as with all the TLA snooping, it is this incidental surveillance of the innocent that all the calls for loosening of
encrypton controls  is about.
After all the near-futile efforts of investigators to bring Echelon out into the open, and counterefforts of pols
and spooks cloak it, the Diana hook may the "Gone

a genuine borad-based opposition, and, may very well be the kickoff to global demand for encryption to protect privacy worldwide and maybe even in the US.

     (364K)
Its comparative review of surveillance law is informative
for the way it lays out the similarity of each country's definition of the threat of technology -- somewhat to citizen privacy but more
importantly to law enforcement. It notes variations in privacy protection law, and finds, for example, US and UK deficiencies in that area even as these countries excell in manufacturing
the evil tools.
Still, South Africa is joining the crowd in tightening controls on
technology by proposing that telecomm providers make their
systems accessible to government (at their own expense), emulating the recent US-EU snooping agreement advanced by the FBI and Europol.

Commerce Updates Export Controls on Encryption Products
(Washington, D.C.)     The Commerce Department will publish new regulations significantly streamlining government export controls on powerful encryption -- products that scramble computer data -- as part of the Clinton Administration initiatives to make government more efficient and enhance the global competitiveness of U.S. businesses. These amendments to the Export Administration Regulations, on public notice today at the Federal Register, end the need for licenses for powerful U.S. encryption products to companies worldwide in several important industry sectors after a one time review by the Commerce Department. The regulations implement the policy changes announced by Vice President Gore in "Through the hard work of industry and government officials to finalize this regulation, U.S. encryption firms will be better able to compete effectively with encryption manufacturers around the world," said William A. Reinsch, Commerce Under Secretary for Export Administration. Virtually eliminated are restrictions on selling powerful computer data scrambling products to subsidiaries of U.S. corporations. There will also be favorable licensing treatment to strategic partners of U.S. companies. Strong U.S.-made encryption products are now available, under license exception, to insurance companies headquartered in 46 countries and their branches worldwide. Sales of powerful encryption to health and medical organizations in the same countries are also eased. To facilitate secure electronic transactions, between on-line merchants in those same countries, and their customers, the updated regulations permit, under a license exception, the export of client-server applications (e.g. SSL) and applications tailored to on-line transactions to on-line merchants. A list of eligible countries is posted on the BXA web-site. Further easing government restrictions are new allowances for U.S. encryption manufacturers to share their source code with their own foreign subsidiaries (while requiring that any resulting new products remain subject to U.S. regulation ) and streamlining reporting requirements for U.S. firms so that compliance is less burdensome.
The new regulations expand the policy of encouraging the use of recoverable encryption by removing the requirement to name and approve key recovery agents for exports of key recovery products from regulations. It also defines a new class of "recoverable" encryption products which can now be exported under Export Licensing Arrangements to foreign commercial firms for internal company proprietary use. As part of its stated goal to balance the needs of national security and public safety with the desire to protect personal privacy and strong electronic commercial security, the Administration continues to encourage the development and sale of products which enable the recovery of the unscrambled data, in an emergency situation.
Finally, the regulations eliminate the need to obtain licenses for most encryption commodities and software up to 56-bits or equivalent strength.

Hi, John.   Received a letter and phone call from Jim, as below.
.   He had a little altercation with a fellow prisoner ("through no fault
of my own" - he thinks he was set up) and his privileges were reduced for
35 days, so that he could only make one phone call each week.
.   In reference to the bad publicity (all those articles and news alerts)
which his case received, he speculates that the government gave a copy of
AP to a 'think tank' like Rand, etc., with the request to figure out how to
stop or delay AP. But it is his conclusion that AP is unstoppable, although:
"I think that one last (temporary) hope for government is to delay AP.
Chances are good that the "think tank" decided thatt the best way to delay
AP is to discredit me, its author.  It was a desperate gamble, particularly
because the act of harrassing me automatically gives AP more publicity.
That's the reason they will fail; the more they try to "get" me, the worse

He wants it noted that his writing and discussions of AP ideas are in the

.   Regarding his guilty plea, he said it was because he realizes that he
did do a few things wrong and that, although he did think that some of the
charges against him were overblown and distorted, there was enough of a
risk of being found guilty that it didn't make a lot of sense to contest
them.  He adds, "I also felt (and still do, of course) that government had
already 'lost the war' so to speak."

go to some of his favorite restaurants, and to have several BIG pizzas.  He
hopes he can get his old job back as electronics designer, and has some
ideas he wants to work on for a virtual reality peripheral device which
will bring everyone steps closer to the Star Trek Next Generation 'holodek'.

It's a grim assessment, revealing more than most of us want to face about the dark side of high technology, especially what the most technologically advanced nations are deploying, and building to sell to the worst of humanity, and how export laws are flaunted to cut criminal deals in defiance of high-minded law and public policy.
It demonstrates that he national security heritage continues, sharing military technology with governmental outlaws around the globe.
And the US is leading the market.
It would be cathartic for this report was widely read, pondered,

@_subject: Soft Tempest 
Bruce Sterling, and others, have asked of the Washington Post story
[see below]:
The Washington Post gives a highly distorted account of some very
important scientific work we have done. I suggest that list members
read our paper -  - for
themselves before getting carried away.
The story is as follows. Bill G gave our department $20m for a new
building, and his people said that what they really wanted from our
group was a better way to control software copying.  So it would have
been rather churlish of us not to at least look at their `problem'.
Now the `final solution' being peddled by the smartcard industry (and
others) is to make software copying physically impossible, by tying
program execution to a unique tamper-resistant hardware token. We
wouldn't like to see this happen, and we have already done a lot to
undermine confidence in the claims of tamper-proofness made by
smartcard salesmen.
So Markus and I sat down and tried to figure out what we could do for
the Evil Empire. We concluded that (1)  large companies generally pay for their software; (2)  if you try to coerce private individuals, the political backlash      would be too much; so (3)  if the Evil Empire is to increase its revenue by cracking down on
     piracy, the people to go after are medium sized companies.
So the design goal we set ourselves was a technology that would enable
software vendors to catch the medium-sized offender - the dodgy
freight company that runs 70 copies of Office 97 but only paid for one
- while being ineffective against private individuals.
We succeeded.
In the process we have made some fundamental discoveries about
Tempest. Army signals officers, defence contractors and spooks have
been visibly flabberghasted to hear our ideas or see our demo.
In the old days, Tempest was about expensive hardware - custom
equipment to monitor the enemy's emissions and very tricky shielding
to stop him doing the same to you. It was all classified and strictly
off-limits to the open research community.
We have ended that era. You can now use software to cause the
eavesdropper in the van outside your house to see a completely
different image from the one that you see on your screen. In its
simplest form, our technique uses specially designed `Tempest fonts'
to make the text on your screen invisible to the spooks. Our paper
tells you how to design and code your own.
There are many opportunities for camouflage, deception and misconduct.
For example, you could write a Tempest virus to snarf your enemy's PGP
private key and radiate it without his knowledge by manipulating the
dither patterns in his screen saver. You could even pick up the signal
on a $100 short wave radio. The implications for people trying to
build secure computer systems are non-trivial.
Anyway, we offered Bill G the prospect that instead of Word radiating
the text you're working on to every spook on the block, it would only
radiate a one-way function of its licence serial number.  This would
let an observer tell whether two machines were simultaneously running
the same copy of Word, but nothing more. Surely a win-win situation,
for Bill and for privacy.
But Microsoft turned down our offer. I won't breach confidences, but
the high order bit is that their hearts are set on the kind of
technology the smartcard people are promising - one that will
definitively prevent all copying, even by private individuals. We
don't plan to help them on that, and I expect that if they field
anything that works, the net result will be to get Microsoft
dismembered by the Department of Justice.
Meantime we want our Soft Tempest technology to be incorporated in as many products as possible - and not just security products!
So to Rainier Fahs, who asked:
I say this: our discovery, that Tempest protection can be done in
software as well as hardware, puts it beyond the reach of effective
export control. So yes, you now have a choice. You didn't before,

British Technology Might Flush Out Software Pirates
By John Burgess
Washington Post Foreign Service
Saturday, February 7, 1998; Page H01 CAMBRIDGE, Englandï¿½ It's a technique that intelligence
agencies have used for years: Park a van filled with
monitoring gear near an embassy and listen for the faint radio
signals that computers routinely emit when they are on.
Analyze those signals for clues to the data that are on the
Now researchers at the University of Cambridge, home of
groundbreaking work in intelligence over the years, are trying
to adapt this technology to the fight against software piracy.
With special code written into software, they say, computers
could be made to broadcast beacons that would carry several
hundred yards and identify the software they were running,
complete with serial numbers of each copy.
Vans run by anti-piracy groups could pull up outside a
company's office and count the number of software signals
emanating from it. If, say, 50 beacons for a particular title
were detected but the company had licensed only two copies
of the software, that could become evidence on which a court
would issue a search warrant.
Ross Anderson, a University of Cambridge lecturer who is
overseeing the project, said the idea originated last year when
Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates visited the university
after his private foundation announced a $20 million donation
to the school. Gates told officials that, among other things, he
would love the university to come up with new anti-piracy
So far, Microsoft isn't enthusiastic about the university's
approach, Anderson said. "They have some reservations.
Obviously there are Big Brother aspects," he said. A
Microsoft spokeswoman said the company has no plans to
adapt the technology.
Emilia Knight, a vice president at BSA Europe, a trade group
that combats software piracy, said such an anti-piracy system
might be technically feasible. But she noted many practical
questions on the legal side, such as how the system would
differentiate between companies pirating software and those
legally using multiple copies of programs.
Knight said that concerns of privacy and consumer rights
might make the system a no-go for industrialized countries.
But in places like Eastern Europe, she suggested, where piracy
is rampant and there is no tradition of such protections, the
software signal detectors might be acceptable.
Richard Sobel, a political scientist who teaches at Harvard
University and researches privacy issues, called it "an
appalling idea."
"If the technology is there to identify what software people are
using, there's the prospect to figure out what people are doing.
. . . It sounds like a horrible violation of privacy," Sobel said.
In Britain, however, it might seem less controversial. Here
authorities have long used similar techniques to ferret out
people who fail to pay the annual license fee of about $150
that the law requires for each TV set in the country.
Cruising the streets here are vans carrying equipment that can
detect emissions from a TV set's "local oscillator," the part
that turns a station's signal into a picture. If the gear senses a
TV set inside a house from which there is no record of a
license payment, this is used as evidence to levy fines.
The system also can tell what channel people are watching
because the oscillator gives off a slightly different signal for
each one.
Anderson's researchers have built a prototype that can detect
the type of software running on a machine from short range --
the hallway outside the room where the computer is running.
Anderson said they are ready to build prototype hardware
with a longer range, at a cost of about $15,000-$30,000 -- if
the lab can find a customer. So far, none has stepped forward.
ï¿½ Copyright 1998 The Washington Post Company
     Today's Washington Post claims that a Cambridge research team led by one      Ross Anderson is developing technology that would require all personal      computers to broadcast the identity of all programs they are running so      that anti-piracy investigators can sit outside universities and businesses      and check to see whether the folks inside are running more programs than      their licenses allow.       The article says that even Microsoft thinks this might go too far in      invading the privacy of computer users. But advocates for the technology      claim that it will work fine in benighted Eastern European countries where      piracy is rampant and the natives are used to having their privacy invaded.
     This raises at least three questions:
     1.  Is this story correct?
     2.  If so, is the Ross Anderson it describes the same Ross Anderson known      on this list for his attacks on Big Brother?
     3.  If so, are we to understand that Ross objects not so much to invading      privacy as to government competition in that endeavor?

Much praise is due Markus and Ross for their astonishing
accomplishment in long-neglected Tempest research.
Their paper is surely causing sleeplessness in dens of
TEMPESTed security agencies accustomed to having
singular self-privacy and others-invasiveness via this technology. Microsoft is to be praised for funding the right thing for the wrong reasons, or perhaps Mr. Gates foresaw what the outcome would be and merely needs intel deniability,
nicely aided by Ross's zipperedness -- that, too, well done.
The Wash Post spin of the story is itself complicitous,

U.S. Losing Battle on Control of Data Encryption, Study Says
By Jeri Clausing
Washington -- The Clinton Administration is losing its battle
to increase international controls over how reliably computer
data can be scrambled to insure privacy, according to a report
to be released Monday by an independent research group. ...
The Electronic Privacy Information Center says that its survey of 243 governments showed that the United
States is virtually the only democratic, industrialized nation
seeling domestic regulation of strong encryption.
That finding directly contradicts the Clinton Administration's
assertions in Congressional hearings that it has the support of
most nations on this issue. ...
William Reinsch, the Under Secretary for export administration
in the United States Commerce Department, denied that the study
contradicted the Administration's assertions. "All the Administration has ever said is that there are more countries that go farther  than we do," Mr. Reinsch said. "The study confirms that."

"Over himself, over his own mind and body, the individual is sovereign"
(J.S. Mill, On Liberty, 1859)
           Next Week's British Encryption Ban
                      by Sean Gabb
Earlier this evening, I was given confidential information by someone
close to a British Cabinet Minister.  I am not in the habit of speaking
to such people, let alone having them leak state secrets to me.  But
that is what happened.  In publishing what I heard, I am now risking a
prosecution under the Official Secrets Acts - or, more likely, being
made to look ridiculous if what I predict does not happen.  These risks
being accepted, here is the leak.
Next Tuesday, the 17th February 1998, the Department of Trade and
Industry will announce plans to outlaw the use of strong encryption
software within the United Kingdom.  We are to be encouraged - and
ultimately forced - to encrypt our e-mail only in ways that will allow
the authorities to read it.
My source was vague about the details of the scheme, saying that they
had not yet been circulated to the full Cabinet.  But I imagine that it
will be more or less a reprint of the Conservative Government's public
consultation paper of March 1997.  This came to nothing because of the
change of Government, and it was even hoped that Labour would have a
more liberal policy on Internet regulation.  However, Margaret Beckett,
the Minister now responsible for trade and industrial policy, is neither
bright nor forceful; and she was early captured by the officials who in
theory are supposed to do her bidding.  If next Tuesday's consultation
paper differs at all from the last one, it will be only in matters of
small detail and presentation.  For this reason, it is probably safe to
take the last paper as a guide to what we can expect.
The Government will propose creating a network of what are called
Trusted Third Parties, or TTPs.  These are to be organisations licensed
to provide encryption services to the public - that is, software,
consultancy and other support.  Because they have been licensed by the
State, we are to be encouraged to believe that they really are
trustworthy - that they are not distributing bad encryption software, or
robbing their clients in other ways.  But just in case we decide not to
believe any of this, it will be made illegal for any unlicensed person
to offer encryption services.  Here, it is worth quoting from last
year's consultation paper:
    The legislation will prohibit an organisation from offering or
providing encryption services to the UK public without a licence.
Prohibition will be irrespective of whether a charge is made for such
services.  The offering of encryption services to the UK public (for
example via the Internet) by an unlicensed TTP outside of the UK will
also be prohibited.  For this purpose, it may be necessary to place
restrictions on the advertising and marketing of such services to the
Enacted into law, this would make it illegal for me to copy encryption
software from my hard disk for a friend, and for computer magazines to
include it on their free cover disks.  It would also allow a strict
supervision of the material and the links given access to by British
sites on the World Wide Web.
The paper never clarifies why we need TTPs in the first place, or why -
their need granted - they can only be trusted if licensed by the State.
But it does say a lot about law enforcement and national security.  Or,
to be more accurate, it does say a lot in the usual code about the need
to fill in any last potholes on the road to a British police state.
Starting with the Interception of Communications Act 1985, the British
State has given itself powers of surveillance that a Third World
dictator might envy.  It can tap our phones on the word of a Minister.
It can burgle our homes and leave recording devices behind on the word
of a senior policeman.  It can trawl through and inspect any records on
us held by any organisation.  It can do all this without our knowledge,
and without any effective system of appeal and redress.  The relevant
laws are careful to describe the permissions for this as "warrants".
But they really are no more than what in France before the Revolution
were called Lettres du Cachet - things that our ancestors boasted did
not and could not exist in the freer air of England.
The spread of personal computers seemed likely at first to extend the
scope of surveillance still further.  This had until then been limited
by cost.  For all the theoretical risks, sending letters in sealed
envelopes through the post has always been reasonably secure:  the costs
of interception can only be justified in exceptional cases.  For the
same reason, most private papers are safe.  But the routing of an
increasing amount of mail through the Internet promised to bring down
the costs of surveillance to the point where everyone could be watched.
The storage of records on computers connected to the Internet promised
to make it possible for the authorities to spy on people by remote
The problem is the development of strong encryption software like pgp,
and its growing popularity among millions of ordinary people who, though
not criminals, have a strong regard for privacy.  It allows us to keep
our e-mail and private records secret to all but the most determined and
expensive attacks.  It gives to us the benefits of instant communication
and mass data storage, but keeps the authorities - despite their new
powers of surveillance - no better informed than in the old days of due
process and envelope steaming.
Therefore all the talk of Trusted Third Parties.  The terms of their
licences will require them to sell encryption software with keys that
cannot be modified by their clients, and to collect and store copies of
these keys for handing over to the authorities.  Last year's document is
full of promises about "strict safeguards" and the like.  But the
reality is this:
    The legislation will provide that the Secretary of State may issue a
warrant requiring a TTP to disclose private encryption keys... or a body
covered by that warrant.
No mention of judicial involvement at the time, or judicial review
afterwards - just more police state commands.
We can ignore anything the Government parrots next week about law
enforcement and national security - or, for that matter, child
pornography and complex fraud.  These really are just code words.  If I
were a criminal, or a terrorist, or a foreign spy, the last encryption
software I would use would come from a Trusted Third Party.  Strong
encryption packages are available all over the Internet, or can pass
from hand to hand on a single floppy disk.  Nor would I worry much about
laws against the transmission of data encrypted with unlicensed
software.  There are ways of keeping the authorities from even knowing
that an Internet message contains encrypted data.
Somewhere, I have an early version of a program called Steganography,
created by Romana Machado.  This takes an encrypted text and merges it
into a graphics file.  My version produces a visible degradation of
picture quality.  Almost certainly, the newer releases have solved this
problem.  Assuming I had them, and were sufficiently unpatriotic -
neither applies in my case, let me add - I could e-mail this country's
battle plans straight off to Saddam Hussain merged invisibly into a
picture of my dog.  GCHQ would never notice until the Scud missiles
began landing on Cheltenham.
No - the encryption ban will be aimed at us, the honest public.  We are
the people who tend to respect the law - or at least to be afraid of it
enough to comply in most cases.  It is our privacy that is to be
stripped away.  It is we who are to become like Winston Smith, living
for every moment when the telescreens are not monitoring our facial
Why this is desired I cannot say.  But we are living though an age of
withering trust in the common people.  In this country, we are not
trusted to possess guns for our self-defence - or indeed to carry carpet
knives locked inside our cars.  We are not trusted to choose and
administer our own medicines, or to bring up our own children in the
manner of our choice, or to decide whether or not oxtail soup might be
bad for us.  Plugging in the telescreens is only a logical next step.
Normally, when I write on these issues, I work myself into a frenzy of
pessimism.  At the moment, though, I feel rather optimistic.  Next
Tuesday's proposals will cause an uproar.  This will not come from the
so-called civil liberties groups like Liberty - excepting a few small
bodies like the Libertarian Alliance, they have all been taken over by
New Labour apparatchiks who can be trusted to keep their mouths shut.
It will come from the big business interests.
British Telecom is the third or fourth largest telecommunications
company in the world.  If operates in more than 40 markets, often
needing to provide its clients with very secure networks.  In the City
of London there are more representative offices of foreign banks than in
the rest of the European Union combined.  These have a taste for
confidentiality.  There are many other large interests - all paying
billions in taxes, all likely to be very hostile to any scheme that will
make them appear less useful to foreign clients.  We have a Labour
Government that still needs to establish itself in the public mind as a
party friendly to business.  These facts can surely be trusted to ensure
the dropping of a scheme that would not merely turn the country into a
full police state, but also do the greatest damage to British business
since nationalisation.
Or so I hope.

In response to Greg Broiles' and Ulf  Mï¿½ller's posts and the prospect of a UK ban on non-escrowed encryption next Tuesday:
                       Opening Address
             Under Secretary William A. Reinsch                  Bureau of Export Administration                    U.S. Department of Commerce

One of the reasons why our licensing load is inching back up is the transfer of encryption licensing to Commerce earlier this year. No speech from me would be complete without a paragraph on encryption, so here it is. Our policy is intended to balance the competing interests of privacy, electronic commerce, law enforcement, and national security. We believe that use of key recovery technologies is the best way to achieve that balance. We do not focus narrowly on a single technology or approach. We expect the market to make those judgments, but we are taking steps to facilitate the development and dissemination of these products.
Our regulations allow recoverable encryption products of any strength and key length to be exported freely after a single review by the government. To encourage movement toward recoverable products, we have also created a special, two-year liberalization period during which companies may export 56 bit DES or equivalent products provided they submit plans to develop key recovery products. This provides an incentive for manufacturers to develop these products, which in turn will facilitate the development of key management infrastructures. So far, we have approved 47 plans, from companies large and small, and have five more pending.
In terms of licenses, in calendar year 1997, we received 2076 applications, and approved 1801 licenses with a dollar value of $4.7 billion. (The reason for the high dollar value is because we approve encryption licensing arrangements for extended periods of time, from 4 to 10 years.)
The interagency working group on cryptography policy, which includes representatives from BXA, NSA, and the FBI, continue to meet to discuss ways to streamline the licensing process on encryption export licenses. Several items have been identified and progress is being made in these areas. We have established a pre-Operating Committee group to discuss contentious cases. In part as a result, no encryption cases have been escalated to the OC since mid-December. We have created an Autolist to eliminate agency referrals. So far, we have agreed to list specific products amounting to 20% of the products we see. This means, once implemented, that a subset of licenses can be processed by Commerce without prior referral to other agencies. Finally, we have posted on our web page "helpful hints" to make the encryption licensing process more transparent:   We continue to work on other initiatives to streamline the process.
We are also discussing with our trading partners a common approach to encryption policy. We have found that most major producing countries have public safety and national security concerns similar to ours. We are working together with these governments to ensure that our policies are compatible, and that they facilitate the emergence of a key management infrastructure.
With respect to legislation, we believe the McCain-Kerrey Bill, S. 909, the Secure Public Networks Act, provides a sound basis for legislation acceptable to both Congress and the Administration. In particular, we appreciate the bill's explicit recognition of the need to balance competing objectives and of the potential for key recovery to become a market-driven mechanism to facilitate maintaining that balance.

Encryption Controls
Export Enforcement has new responsibilities in the encryption area. Over the past year, Export Enforcement has opened many new investigations involving alleged violations of the encryption regulations. These cases are being watched very closely. The national security of the United States depends in part on the government's ability to obtain timely information about the activities and plans of potentially hostile foreign parties, such as terrorists and drug dealers. ... the Department of Justice and National Security Agency participate in processing licenses for encryption. ... The increase in licenses we are experiencing is attributable not only to increased exports, but to transfer of items from the Munitions List to Commerce jurisdiction. Encryption licenses account for a significant portion of the increase. We created a special division to handle those. As of today, there is only one encryption case that has been pending over 40 days.

Frankfurt, Germany (AP) -- Germany's spy chief has denied U.S. allegations that his agents spy on American companies, but he warned German firms that such economic espionage is soaring internationally. Bernd Schmidbauer said in comments published Saturday that, in contrast to most countries' spy agencies, Germany's is not involved in any economic espionage. The Frankfurter Allgemeine daily reported that the FBI last month accused Germany of running a post near Frankfurt that eavesdrops on U.S. phones and tries to break into American computer systems. "We're astounded about those reports from the FBI," the newspaper quoted Schmidbauer as saying. He said the post is involved only in trying to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The FBI does not normally identify governments it suspects of economic spying. But an article last month, written by an FBI agent for the industry magazine Public Administration Review, lists Germany along with France, Israel, China and South Korea as major offenders. The article said more than 700 investigations involving economic espionage by foreign governments are pending before the bureau. The FBI confirmed that figure last month. The American Society for Industrial Security estimated that American businesses lost $300 billion in intellectual property to foreign and domestic spies last year. Schmidbauer said German companies also are increasingly targeted, and warned that any conversations, faxes or computer information carried over phone lines or mobile phones could be eavesdropped. "A lot of money is being lost through this form of espionage," Schmidbauer said, without giving a figure. "And it's not only east European spies that are snapping up know-how from German "Our companies are relatively naive," he said. "Concrete steps must be taken ... including encoding techniques."

It's easy to fault the military as an organization, as easy as
with any other. Most of us have had enough experience with
them to know what Dilbert knows, even if we can't quip like
the master.
What's hard is to know the unexplainable of combat and
be unable to convey what it's like to those who haven't
had the peculiar disorientation of losing whatever ability you've ever had to tell the difference between living and No book or film or general has ever got right, nor any tale told by skulled out vets sober or not.
What's never told is what it's like to lose control of mind and
body for days weeks and months. Maybe it can't be told, can't be remembered, can't be related in normal ways of communicating. Maybe that's why some of the best war
stuff is created by those who've never been there.
Enduring an artillery barrage is beyond comprehension, your
body goes to pieces under the crushing sound and concussion,
and involuntary reactions overwhelm the normal controls of all
organs and orifices. Every part goes haywire, beyond stopping,
everybody on the scene can't help becoming beaten meat
flopping and scrambling to get underground, trying to scream
amidst god's loudest roar of thunder and screeching richocheting
Bombing is far worse than that.
Even the hit of high speed round will hydraulic-ram your blood into
parts of your carcass it was never meant to go, and your senses
go numb with shock, and nothing works, body or mind. And that's
before you become conscious enough to see the savagery the slug's done to your precious gut, arm, leg, crotch -- if it didn't
fly through your helmet and skull leaving you permanently
There's no way to get ready for the worst you'll ever experience
and wish you hadn't. Maybe that's why most vets forget what
they actually experienced and fall back on the tired and true lies
of war stories. Nobody could possibly believe the other if you
could manage to tell the truth, which I doubt anybody's got the
courage to do, to relive that, when every instinct of survival is to go blank.
Which is why you'll see now and then some who just sit and stare a long way past the horizon, like math geniuses in Princeton deep
Anyway, this has nothing to do with recruiting and patriotism which are about wholly believable war stories like you see
on tv and hear down at the lodge and bar.

   Clinton Continues to Stumble Over the 'E' Word (Encryption)
   By John Markoff
   San Francisco, Feb. 26 -- President Clinton described the
   economic impact of the Internet today in glowing terms to
   an audience of technology investors here, but he failed to
   touch on the issue that increasingly appears to matter most
   to Silicon Valley: the fiery debate over the
   Administration's policy on data scrambling.
   The Clinton Administration has endeared itself to the
   nation's high-technology center by cutting capital gains
   taxes and by calling today for a bill that would bar state
   and local governments from enacting taxes on the Internet
   until 2004. But encryption may prove to be the
   Administration's Achilles' heel in its otherwise friendly
   ties with Silicon Valley.
   The debate over encryption -- which has pitted industry and
   civil liberties groups against law enforcement and
   intelligence agencies -- has sharpened in recent weeks. New
   legislation that would restrict the unlimited use of
   encryption is about to be introduced on Capitol Hill. A
   series of intense behind-the-scenes negotiations over a
   compromise solution between the Clinton Administration and
   a small group of high-technology executives suggests that
   no simple resolution is in sight.
   Encryption policy has become a flash point because it is
   both essential for the growth of Internet commerce and
   vital for the protection of privacy. Techniques that use
   mathematical formulas permit computers to scramble data so
   they cannot be read without access to a special "key,"
   usually a large number that permits a user to unscramble
   the information. Law enforcement officials want to force
   users to put such keys in escrow with independent
   authorities to allow for electronic surveillance in
   criminal investigations.
   President Clinton has told Silicon Valley executives in
   private meetings that he is sympathetic with their
   viewpoint but that he is under great pressure from law
   enforcement and national security officials to put even
   greater controls in place on encryption technology.
   "To us this is really important, but it's just an irritant
   to him," said one Silicon Valley executive who met with the
   President before his speech today and asked not be
   identified further. "His basic message to us was, 'Can we
   get this thing done?' "
   Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Bob
   Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, are circulating a revised
   version of their encryption bill, which includes several
   changes in response to industry and privacy concerns but it
   has so far won few adherents outside of the law-enforcement
   community.
   Critics say the legislation is simply a placeholder for
   future laws that would restrict the use of the technology.
   "Everyone who is looking at the export issue is looking at
   it as a prelude to domestic controls," said Mark Rasch, a
   former Federal prosecutor who is now a specialist in
   encryption and computer security issues at the Science
   Applications International Corporation in McLean, Va.
   Industry opponents of encryption controls, heavily financed
   by high-technology companies, are preparing to announce on
   Wednesday a new coalition, Americans for Privacy, aimed at
   ending restrictions on encryption technology exports.
   At the same time Hewlett Packard plans to announce on
   Friday a new set of encryption technologies, with
   endorsements from the Department of Commerce and companies
   like I.B.M.. These technologies known as the International
   Cryptographic Framework, would let individual governments
   establish potentially conflicting encryption policies -- or
   even place no restrictions.
   Silicon Valley executives argue that the law-enforcement
   demand for the continued ability to wiretap in the
   information age is wishful thinking at best. The easy
   availability of powerful encryption software has made it
   possible for any two people, anywhere in the world to hold
   a secret conversation beyond the prying of even the most
   powerful code-breaking computer, they say.
   The White House is now considering several other industry
   proposals intent on finding a compromise between industry
   and law enforcement interests.
   Another approach that is now being raised in negotiations
   between industry executives and the White House has been
   put forth by executives from Cisco Systems, the company
   that is the dominate provider of Internet routing
   equipment.
   The Cisco proposal, known as Clearzone, would place
   encryption in the network instead of from personal computer
   to personal computer. Then, if a law-enforcement agency had
   a warrant to wiretap, it would be possible to go to an
   Internet provider that could then turn off encryption. But
   this proposal makes no provision for retrieving stored
   information also sought by law-enforcement agents.

Excerpt from congressional hearing on RF weapons:
      Mr. David Schriner is the Principal Engineer directed energy studies with Electronic Warfare Associates and a recently retired engineer with the naval weapons testing facility at China Lake. He has numerous patents, has
received superior service awards, and given technical presentations over 42 years of civil and military service. He will discuss the difficulty in building a RF weapon and the terrorist threat.
      In support of the information presented in this testimony and taking advantage of the winter's need to work indoors, a unit that uses oil spark-gaps was designed, built, and tested. The materials for it were mail-ordered at a
cost of about $500 and about one week was needed to fabricate the mechanical hardware. It use two ignition coils and a battery for power, an automobile fuel pump and filter for the oil circulation, and commonly available transformer
oil. An additional week was required to work out all of the electrical wiring, the oil lines, and the general finishing details. This unit was ready for testing in two weeks after starting the effort.       The signal radiated from the unit was measured and found to be a very significant power level that can be compared against available vulnerability
and susceptibility levels of military equipment. When the weather permits, this
unit will be tested against a set of infrastructure targets at an official test
range. consistently deadly to many types of infrastructure items at ranges suitable
for terrorist usage.       This quickly-developed low-cost system could easily be placed in a small van and used in a parking lot or directed at buildings that the van was driven past. It is highly likely that this type of device would be a very effective terrorist system and the findings of its design could be factored into another either a larger, higher powered device, or a more advanced design each with significantly greater effectiveness.       The net result of all of this design, experimentation, fabrication and measurement proves that such a weapon system could be made by anyone with an engineering degree or even a bright technician with good hardware experience. The technical information required can be found in open sources, if not just from good common engineering sense. The materials needed are nothing special
and if the effort is made, advanced concepts can be made using everyday hardware
such as automotive ignition systems. The testing to date has been very limited but
the results of this testing have provided considerable insight to just what is vulnerable in infrastructure systems. This insight and work leads to a firm opinion that a terrorist would have little trouble developing such technology
and that he would have a high probability of success in the use as an RF weapon against our infrastructure elements found in any city or near facilities around the country.       This work has been done within the proper security guidelines since:       1.The models made in my home laboratory/workshop used off-the-shelf
materials         and open-source references.
      2.The laboratory tests of this hardware were made in a controlled
environment         with the proper security in place.
      3.The results of these tests, the data capabilities, and the target set         identities are kept in a facility cleared for classified storage.
      4.The development of any of this hardware is reported on a regular
basis to         those with whom I relate at a classified level to assure that they are         informed of the work and are able to apply this to their interests and         efforts if necessary. Any of this hardware can be used by them for any
        determination of utility to military interests.       Work in this area will be continued and an aggressive test and
evaluation of these "back yard" techniques and methods will be accomplished. This process
will be done in cooperation, and if requested, under the direction of agencies with an interest in this non-military weapon related process. The author of this
report will, if requested, provide to the Committee further details at a classified level
in the proper security environment. Full hearing testimony:

Legislative Amendments
Electronic Copyright Infringement
9. Issue for Comment
    The No Electronic Theft Act, Public Law 105-147, was recently enacted to provide a statutory basis to prosecute and punish persons who, without authorization and without realizing financial gain or commercial advantage, electronically access copyrighted materials or encourage others to do so. The Act includes a directive to the Commission to (A) ensure that the applicable guideline range for a crime committed against intellectual property (including offenses set forth at section 506(a) of title 17, United States Code, and sections 2319, 2319A, and 2320 of title 18, United States Code) is sufficiently stringent to deter such a crime; and (B) ensure that the guidelines provide for consideration of the retail value and quantity of the items with respect to which the crime against intellectual property was     Each of the statutes mentioned in the congressional directive currently are referenced to Sec. 2B5.3 (Criminal Infringement of Copyright or Trademark). That guideline provides for incrementally greater punishment when the retail value of the infringing items exceeded $2,000. However, when copyrighted materials are infringed upon by electronic means, there is no ``infringing item'', as would be the case with counterfeited goods. Therefore, the Commission must determine how to value the infringed upon items in order to implement the congressional directive to take into account the retail value and quantity of the items with respect to which the offense was
committed. The Commission invites comment on how Sec. 2B5.3 (Criminal Infringement of Copyright or Trademark) should be amended to best effectuate the congressional directives.
    An approach suggested by the Department of Justice is set forth below. The Commission invites comment on this and alternative     Department of Justice Proposed Amendments to Sec. 2B5.3:
    The text of Sec. 2B5.3 is amended to read as follows: ``(a) Base offense level: [6]
    (b) Specific Offense Characteristic
    (1) If the loss to the copyright or trademark exceeded $2,000, increase by the corresponding number of levels from the table in Sec. 2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit).''.
    The Commentary to Sec. 2B5.3 captioned ``Application Note'' is amended in Note 1 by striking:
    `` `Infringing items' means the items that violate the copyright or trademark laws (not the legitimate items that are infringed upon).'',
and inserting:
    ``A court may calculate the `loss to the copyright or trademark owner' in any reasonable manner. In determining `loss to the copyright or trademark owner,' the court may consider lost profits, the value of the infringed upon items, the value of the infringing items, the injury to the copyright or trademark owner's reputation, and other associated     The Commentary to Sec. 2B5.3 captioned ``Application Note'' is amended by striking ``Note'' and inserting ``Notes''; and by adding at the end the following new note:
    ``2. In some cases, the calculable loss to the victim understates the true harm caused by the offense. For example, a defendant may post copyrighted material to an electronic bulletin board or similar online facility, making it easy for others to illegally obtain and further distribute the material. In such an instance, it may not be possible to determine or even estimate how many copies were downloaded, or how much damage the defendant's conduct ultimately caused. In such cases, an upward departure may be warranted. See Chapter Five, Part K     The Commentary to Sec. 2B5.3 captioned ``Background'' is amended in the first paragraph by striking ``value of the infringing items'' and inserting ``loss to the copyright or trademark owner''; and by striking ``loss or''.

A clue to what's coming: BXA is due to issue its regulations for
implementing the Wassenaar Arrangement about January 26, so wrote
Jim Lewis at the agency. (Most here know that Wassenaar is
an international agreement among thirty-plus nations to control
export of technology, including encryption.)
Other nations who have signed Wassenaar will probably follow suit, preceded already by Australia and maybe others. Scuttlebutt is that
they're awaiting the US giant's move (or dealing for better incentives).
Further, there's surely preparatory work going on for crypto legislation
in the upcoming session, and we may see a push early in the term
in concert with Wassenaar and perhaps other Net regulations stimulated
by fear of infrastructure terrorism.
What's worth pondering is what new arguments will be made for
controlling/decontrolling crypto, new ways to divide the baby so every interest group can have a chunk, new serendipitous incidents, accidents and incentives.
Recall Bill Renisch's comment that nothing has ever boosted
interest in BXA-who like encryption, as several legislators and
other who's-thats in and out of gov have discovered. Any
topic that generates public attention is not to be ignored for long.
Along parallel lines, The New Yorker mag of January 12 has two
stories of note:
A short one on how blame the militants for the OKC bombing
so powerfully argued before the trials of McVeigh and Nichols
was not pursured during the trials. It suggests an apology to
militants is in order for groundless accusations.
Another much longer on the economic theory behind Justice's attack on Microsoft and how it challenges free market theory,
especially for high technology. That government intervention
may be needed for the pervasive dependency of society on such technology because it has such vast potential for harm. A curious parallel to the argument for Wassenaar.

   because it was encoding, not encryption, that was being
   regulated. This is disturbing.
   This at first seemed to put some of the Nautilus development
   team's software in jeopardy, but I believe that by the letter
   of the law (or regulation) that all coders in Nautilus are not

@_subject: CAD Stego 
This repeats a suggestion from 1994 about using computer
assisted design programs to conceal text or other data:
1. CAD uses vectors to make graphics, including text,
and most programs can import a wide variety of data from other formats.
2. Several features can manipulate CAD objects into
unrecognizable forms by modifying scale, dimension,
orientation, opacity and so on.
3. The scale feature is useful to reduce, say, a text
of any length, or any digital object, to the size of a pixel. This pixel can be located, say, under a visible line, or, be made transparent as a "phantom" object. (An engineer
"stipples" concrete with microdot exotica and lofts the docs
to the Saudis, getting paid ten times the regular fee.)
4. Or, the text can be distorted by scale and dimension
to appear to be a line serving another function.
5. It's a snap to encrypt the text and import
it into CAD via several programs that do that duty.
Then the message could be distorted or hidden as
described above, for piggy-backing on an innocent-
looking document issued, say, to GSA for replenishing
the Blanco Bunker, where it would be opened by the
cp insider-sou-chef for de-distorted, decrypted instructions on how to prepare and place the bean.
6. To be sure, the underlying CAD code of the ciphertext could be identified by an astute auto-message-vetter of the EOP and then the CADbreakers would be beckoned to the roachtrap.
7. Big shortcoming: how to securely transmit the location (virtual coordinates) of the hidden message and what modifications need to be reversed for message access.
Beware of using 0,0,0 -- a near-universal data point for
CAD docs. However, 0,0,2^50 miles might be overlooked
if the 3d view is disabled.
8. Medium shortcoming: Full-featured CAD programs are expensive, however, the popular lite versions are cheap
and can usually read the pricier output.

Printed ads are sometimes not archived as widely as news articles, due
to the cost of reproduction, distribution and storage.
The same is true, though, of personals and other types of throwaways.
One possibility is to buy an ad on the NYT Front Page which is often sent
as an image around the world separately from the full paper, and on which one can buy a tiny ad for about $800 for two lines of text 32 characters long (ID must be included). That's the rate for a one-timer.
Adam, could you reduce the requisite gob to fit 64 characters? Each extra

This contrast confirms the report a few days back that any commercial crypto product that receives export approval from

this appears to be the unpublished requirement for granting of approvals, case by case. Either cooperate or face indefinite As Peter noted some time ago, this is what he was running into when he could not get a clear answer about NZ regulations, and parallels reports of similar experiences in the US, UK and other countries.
There is a similar current thread on UK Crypto about the difficulty

On "using honey not vinegar" rationale of RPK InvisiMail for
obtaining crypto export licenses:
Applied Cryptography, Bruce Schneier, 2nd Edition, pp. 215-16
Algorithms for Export
Algorithms for export out of the United States must be approved by the U.S. government (actually, by the NSA--see Section 25.1)
It is widely believed that these export-approved algorithms can be broken by the NSA. Although no one has admitted this on the record, these are some of the things the NSA is rumored to privately
suggest to companies wishing to export their cryptographic products:
  - Leak a key bit once in a while, embedded in the ciphertext.
  - "Dumb down" the effective key to something in the 30-bit range.   For example, while the algorithm might accept a 100-bit key, most   of those keys might be equivalent.
  - Use a fixed IV, or encrypt a fixed header at the beginning of   each encrypted message. This facilitates a known-plaintext attack.
  - Generate a few random bytes, encrypt them with the key, and then
  put both the plaintext and the ciphertext of those random bytes at   the beginning of the encrypted message. This also facilitates a   known-plaintext attack.
NSA gets a copy of the source code, but the algorithm's details remain secret from everyone else. Certainly no one advertises any of these deliberate weaknesses, but beware if you buy a U.S. encryption product that has been approved for export.
Bruce added the last "beware" phrase to the 2nd edition.

state wants to bug you AND YOU choose to use a handset which DOES NOT break the analogue path between the microphone and the ISDN NTU / TA (all standard analogue phones break the circuit, AFAIK.  It's only the speakerphone gadgets that could be subverted.) Then I suppose this is possible.  But who gives a s**t about the .1% of vulnerable phones. And it would be dead easy to mod them to defeat any such attempt.  There are loads of easier ways to mount covert surveillance than screwing up the phone system!
   >and listen into conversations occurring near the phone,
   >without the user being aware that it is happening."
ISDN is NOT a 'message switching protocol', and there is none as such on Sys X and Y, which use SS7 for inter-switch signalling anyway.  The ISDN interfaces and service are only defined for the ends of various types of subscriber line, as far as I remember.  What happens inside the provider
network is up to the provider and is not ISDN.
I'm much more concerned about the Echelon system which was (finally)
reported in the Sunday Telegraph just before Xmas.  This system, it is
alleged, can intercept and look for keywords in ALL international comms
traffic.  I believe this also gets a mention in the Europarliament report.

Frank Rowlett, a founder of NSA's National Cryptologic School,
has died at 90. The New York Times has an obituary on the
"code wizard" today:
   Rowlett was one of three earliest recruits of William Friedman,
head of the the US Army Signal Intelligence Service, a 1930s forerunner of NSA's "massive cryptologic system today" (Kahn). After a long career in Army cryptology Rowlett served with the CIA and was special assistant to the DIRNSA at the end of his service in the 1960s.
He is credited with helping to break the Japanese RED and PURPLE codes, efforts unlerlying the Allies World War II MAGIC cryptanalysis system.
He was also an inventor, following work of others, of the
SIGABA machine, the US Army's version of Hebern's cipher device, and  held other cryptologic patents.
David Kahn has tart remarks in The Codebreakers about how Friedman, and to a lesser extent, Rowlett, got national awards for work done by others, through "well-situated
friends, picayune mechanical differences, and a great but
totally irrelevant record." (page 392)

Maybe you know that the FBI offers about 256 pages of
docouments related to Nikola Tesla on its FOIA Web site:
   HTTP://
They are in two large PDF files of 4.8MB and 5.8MB.
In case you've not seen them here's a brief:
None of the papers are by Tesla himself, and most
relate to various inquiries about Tesla's "missing papers,"
based on O'Neil's book claim that the FBI confiscated Tesla's papers and effects shortly after his death. The FBI claims that it was the Alien Property Office which had Tesla's effects and that the FBI had not been involved.
Several focus on Tesla's famous "Death Ray" of the 1940s,
with requests for access to the scientific papers on it, or
warn of its possible use by foreign enemies. To most the
FBI sends a standard disavowal.
However, one is of interest: a Feb 1981 inquiry by the Defense Department which stated in a then-classified "(C) We believe that certain of Tesla's papers may contain
basic principles which would be of considerable value to
ongoing research within the DoD."
The FBI answers that it never had Tesla's papers but reports that a review of those at the Alien Property Office by an MIT scientific team found that none of the papers contained significant scientific information of national
security interest. Yet, the FBI goes on, the Alien Property Office told the FBI in the 1950s that in the only recorded visit to the Tesla archive in January 1943 (shortly after
Tesla's death) an unidentified "Federal authority" microfilmed numerous papers, film whose whereabouts
the FBI knows nothing.
There's a bit more about electronic research at Wright Paterson AFB. And a DoD thank you letter on behalf of Dr. S. L. Zeiburg, Deputy Undersecretary
(Strategic and Space Systems).
A once-secret 1983 series investigated a claim that Margaret Cheney's biography of Tesla, "Tesla: Man Out of Time,"  points to national security threats based on allegations of Soviet development of his experiments using papers possibly obtained through his nephew, Sava Kosanovic, a high Yugoslav official. Many pages of Cheney's book marked at threatening passages on the "missing papers" are in the file.

The New York Times, July 6, 1998, p. A10.
   Editorial
   Privacy in the Digital Age
   As more and more Americans communicate and do business
   electronically, the fear is spreading that information they
   transmit can be seized by hackers or criminals and used for
   illegal or unsavory purposes. Fortunately, the technology
   to thwart such invasions already exists. It is called
   encryption, or the encoding of digital information to
   secure its privacy. But the Federal Bureau of Investigation
   is trying hard to prevent the growing use of encryption,
   both in the United States and abroad, because of fears that
   the protective technology itself will get into the wrong
   hands. That shortsighted stand will undermine efforts to
   protect commercial transactions and may actually hamper law
   enforcement rather than help it.
   The Clinton Administration's current policies toward
   encryption have been largely dictated by the F.B.I. and the
   Justice Department. These two agencies now block encryption
   makers from exporting their most advanced technology unless
   they agree to develop a method allowing law enforcement
   agencies to gain access to it. The method favored by the
   F.B.I. is known as the key escrow, in which the key to
   cracking a code is kept with a third party that could hand
   it over quickly if law enforcement agencies demanded it.
   But the key escrow method poses tremendous threats to
   privacy. There is a danger that access to keys for the code
   could be abused by law enforcement agencies and others.
   Worse, the United States would be required to share key
   escrow information with law enforcement agencies of other
   countries, and giving access to private communications to
   countries with poor human rights records could lead to
   crackdowns on dissidents using encryption for their own
   communications.
   According to industry officials, the export controls are
   already backfiring. More and more foreign companies are
   supplying encryption technologies without key escrow
   arrangements, making it virtually impossible for the F.B.I.
   to eavesdrop and stealing business from American firms. The
   growing foreign role diminishes the ability of the F.B.I.
   to demand new safeguards or ways to penetrate the
   communications of criminals who use encryption.
   President Clinton might normally be more sympathetic to
   concerns over maintaining privacy in the digital world. But
   since Attorney General Janet Reno has protected Mr. Clinton
   from an independent counsel on campaign finance, the White
   House is said to be loath to oppose either her or Louis
   Freeh, the F.B.I. Director, on this issue.
   On Capitol Hill, the debate over encryption has created
   some unusual political alliances. Many conservative
   Republicans have stood with leaders of the high-tech
   industry to oppose any kind of ban on encryption within the
   United States and to support a loosening of export controls
   on encryption technology. It has been odd to see Trent
   Lott, the Senate majority leader, and Dick Armey, the House
   majority leader, stand with civil libertarians against the
   demands of the F.B.I. But the F.B.I. is not without
   influence. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, more friendly to
   the agency, has prevented a bill encouraging greater use of
   encryption from coming to a vote in the House.
   The concerns of law enforcement agencies are legitimate.
   But smart criminals are already using encryption, some of
   which is readily available on the Internet. That was the
   message conveyed only a few weeks ago by such unlikely
   allies as Bill Gates of Microsoft and Jim Barksdale of
   Netscape, who are on opposite sides in the Justice
   Department's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft but agree
   on this issue.
   The F.B.I. should give up its losing fight against
   encryption and work with industry to develop new means to
   catch criminals who use it. One approach under discussion
   would be to develop software technology that could be
   surreptitiously placed in a suspect's computer to capture
   keystrokes before they are encrypted. Any such operation
   would have to be carried out under strict court control as
   the electronic equivalent of a search warrant. But law
   enforcement agencies have to find a legal and ethical way
   to stay ahead of technology, rather than stand in the way
   of it. Trying to block advances in the digital age is
   futile.

We've transcribed a fax of Senator Thompson's
Amendment as Substitute for S.712, "Government
Secrecy Reform Act of 1998," passed by the
Governmental Affairs Committee on June 17:
     (37K)
Here's a report on the amendment and vote:
NCC Washington Update, vol. 4,  July 1, 1998
[National Coordinating Committee for the Promotion of History]
Senate Committee Adopts Substitute Bill for
Moynihan's Government Secrecy Reform Act
Senate Committee Adopts Substitute Bill for Moynihan's Government
Secrecy Reform Act -- On June 17 the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
met to consider a substitute bill for S.712, the Government Secrecy Reform
Act of 1998.  By voice vote, with no negative votes heard, the Committee
passed the substitute bill proposed by Senator Fred Thompson (R-TENN), the
chair of the Committee, and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME).  The original
bill had provided a framework for reform but had lacked the specifics
which this bill provides.
The substitute bill make four major changes from the bill that was
originally introduced.  First, this bill eliminates the section calling
for the establishment of a National Declassification Center in an existing
agency -- which many had thought could be the National Archives -- and
instead expands the functions and oversight responsibilities of the
existing Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) and moves that
office from the National Archives to the Executive Office of the
President.  Second, the bill states that classified information must be
declassified after 25 years unless, as the bill summary states,
"extraordinary circumstances" require that it remain classified.  The
original bill had a 30 year time limit for most information to remain
classified.  Third, the substitute bill retains the balancing test of the
original bill; however, the revised bill establishes criteria to guide
agency classification decisions for weighing the concerns of national
security and the public interest in disclosure.  The national security
criteria are taken directly from President Clinton's E.O 12958 and the
public interest criteria are newly developed for the substitute bill.
Fourth, the substitute bill establishes a Classification and
Declassification Review Board composed of 5 public members to hear agency
and individual appeals regarding classification and declassification
Once the report for the amended S. 712 is filed, which is expected to
happen in mid-July, then the substitute bill will be referred to the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for 30 days for their
consideration.  It is anticipated that the Intelligence Committee may hold
hearings and may have objections to the balancing test provision of the
bill.  Since there appears to be little attention in the House to this
legislation and since there are not many legislative days remaining before
adjournment, it is doubtful that this legislation will pass in the 105th

U.S. to Ease Limits on Export of Data-Scrambling Technology
By Elizabeth Corcoran
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, July 7, 1998; Page E04 Commerce Secretary William Daley plans to announce today
that the government will give U.S. software companies new
freedom to export their most sophisticated data-scrambling
technology to financial institutions chartered in 45 countries,
according to Clinton administration sources.
Under the new rules, which officials said are likely to take
effect in late summer, eligible banks, securities firms,
brokerage houses and credit-card companies will need to
receive approval only once from the Commerce Department
before they can license the most sophisticated "encryption," or
data-scrambling, technology.
Once they receive approval, those institutions will be
permitted to share the technology with any of their branch
offices, except for those located in terrorist states.
Government sources estimate that the new rules will include
about 70 percent of the world's banks, including the 100
largest (ranked by assets).
For years, the government has closely regulated export of
encryption software, on the grounds that terrorists or hostile
governments might use it to cloak their communications. The
software industry argues that the rules are unworkable and
unfairly block foreign sales. Unfriendly parties wanting to use
encryption already can obtain it overseas, industry executives
The new rules on banks are "a move in the right direction,"
said one industry executive familiar with the regulations. "But
we're still leaving some groups out. Basically, we need to keep
spreading the circle wider," to include the growing number of
businesses offering financial services, such as insurance
"What we've heard sounds great," said Kawika Daguio, a
lobbyist for the American Bankers Association. "We've been
arguing [for several years] that the regulatory structure we
have guarantees we're good citizens" who wouldn't make illicit
use of the technology, he said.
Now the government appears to have agreed.
Current regulations require that U.S. companies apply for
permits before exporting anything but the simplest versions of
encryption products. To export more sophisticated
technology, organizations must have a plan for creating
so-called "spare keys." That way, law enforcement officials
who have obtained a court order would be able to unlock the
In May 1997, the Commerce Department said it would not
restrict the sophistication of the data-encryption technology
sold to financial institutions. But it required spare keys and
case-by-case licensing. Approvals have been slow. Now the
government is doing away with the key requirement, defining
more precisely which financial institutions qualify and pledging
to end case-by-case approval.
Because of concerns about money laundering, the government
will grant the new permission only to financial institutions
chartered in countries that have agreed to take steps against
money-laundering. If U.S. companies want to sell to financial
institutions chartered in other countries, they will have to
apply for licenses from the Commerce Department.
Such provisions still fall short of the demands of U.S.
companies. "To take a piecemeal approach [to loosening
encryption restrictions] is the wrong direction," said Ed
Gillespie, executive director of Americans for Computer
Privacy, a lobbying group. "We need a blanket lifting of
restrictions with individual prohibitions," such as bans on
sending such technology to terrorist states, he said.
In a related development, a federal court in Ohio ruled on
Friday that posting the text of an encryption program on the
Internet, where people all over the world could see it, was not
protected by the constitutional right to free speech.
The ruling, made late Friday, contradicts a ruling made by a
California district court last August. Privacy advocates predict
that the issue will be taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court. ï¿½ Copyright 1998 The Washington Post Company

of crypto controls while not truly doing so, as in the

are expected as the US trade and crypto czars make
their global rounds to arrange overt-covert deals for
marketing munitions. The complicity of the banks and giant corps is not surprising with their legacy of doing just that -- as one defense expert says, expect ex-gov crypto watchdogs to aid the market titans to lure government buyers while peddling cheap knockoffs
to voters.
Amazing that the NYT sent up that trial balloon for
government access to key strokes in lieu of GAK.
Who's pushing that, working on the technology?

Software Publishers Are Not Protected by the First Amendment

press release, please send e-mail to .
     _________________________________________________________________
Cleveland, Ohio, July 8 -- On July 3, 1998 Judge Gwin of the United States District Court of the
Northern District of Ohio held that computer programs are not writings
protected by the constitution because they are ``inherently
functional'' and granted summary judgment dismissing a suit
challenging regulations that forbid the publication of encryption
programs on the Internet or the World Wide Web.
The suit was brought by Peter Junger, a law professor at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland, to enjoin the enforcement of export
regulations on encryption software that prevent him from publishing
his class materials and articles for his course in Computing and the
Law on the Internet because they contain some encryption programs.  Junger claimed in his suit that those encryption programs were
writings that were entitled to the full protection of the First
Amendment.  ``Of course they are writings,'' Junger says, ``I know
because I wrote some of them.  And I need to be able to publish them
if I am ever going to be able to explain to lawyers and law students
how computers work and how the law should be applied to computing.''
The government, on the other hand, argued that its export regulations,
which require that one obtain a license from the Commerce Department
before publishing materials containing encryption software on the
Internet or the World Wide Web, seek only to restrict the distribution
of encryption software itself, not ideas on encryption.  And Judge
Gwin agreed with the government, finding that: ``the Export
Regulations are constitutional because encryption source code is
inherently functional, because the Export Regulations are not directed
at source code's expressive elements, and because the Export
Regulations do not reach academic discussions of software, or software
in print form.''
In a related case in California brought by mathematics professor
Daniel Bernstein, Federal District Court Judge Patel held that
computer programs are speech that is protected by the First Amendment,
but Judge Gwin rejected that argument, saying: ``The Bernstein court's
assertion that `language equals protected speech' is unsound. `Speech'
is not protected simply because we write it in a language.''  It is
Judge Gwin's position that computer source code is a purely functional
device: ``The court in Bernstein misunderstood the significance of
source code's functionality. Source code is `purely functional,' in a
way that the Bernstein Court's examples of instructions, manuals, and
recipes are not.  Unlike instructions, a manual, or a recipe, source
code actually performs the function it describes. While a recipe
provides instructions to a cook, source code is a device, like
embedded circuitry in a telephone, that actually does the function of
There is thus a clear split between the two courts: Judge Patel
holding that computer software is protected by the First Amendment and
Judge Gwin holding that it isn't.  The Bernstein case is on appeal and
Professor Junger says that he intends to appeal Judge Gwin's decision:
``We have had almost no financial support for this case, but the issue
of whether encryption software and software in general is protected
like other writings under the First Amendment, or whether it is to be
treated as a special exception like obscenity and fighting words as Judge
Gwin held, is so important that we will have to scrape up the
resources somehow to bring an appeal.''
Judge Gwin's opinion is now available at and is mirrored at .

Good afternoon gentlemen,
I've been reading the correspondence on the possibility of govt
keystroke access with some interest. I'm in a slightly odd position as
I'm responsible for security in one of the larger wintel companies. As
such I've been getting quite a feeling of deja vu reading your mails.
Intel and others are moving in exactly this direction with a number of
initiatives, most notably the PC98, PCXX, and "Wired For Management".
WfM in particular is very scary - one of the components is a facility
for PC's to download and run digitally signed software before the OS is
booted - between "the end of BIOS initialisation and when control is
transferred to a high-level OS" in the words of one Intel document. The
code is verified by routines embedded in the BIOS and will allegedly use
some subset of X.509v3 and PKCS
As so often happens in circumstances like this I can't risk passing
documents directly as I can't be sure of their provenance - I really
have no idea which ones are now considered trade secrets and which have
been made public. Instead I recommend you have a look at the Intel WfM

Forwarded from a long-time cpunk who received a call from Jim Bell yesterday. Jim asked that this message be By this post he is publically accusing the Federal Government of having spied on him from two physical addresses.  These are two houses to the North & to the East of his parent's house.  The government moved in within 6 months (approx) of the time before his arrest.
One of the addresses is 7217 Mississippi, which is listed as "Billy King", who died a couple of years ago.  The  house is ostensibly being occupied by his widow (or that is the
impression).  It is listed as being as owned by Alverna King, but he has his doubts.
The other is address is 7302 Corregidor, purchased about 2.5 - 3 years ago by someone. Listed as being the address of Sundown Development, a small business company.  A second floor was added soon after it was acquired by the company.  They aren't listed as the owners on record, but they are listed as being at that address.  Thinks this is a sham.
The govmt was basically next door spying on him for at least a year, before it started provoking him.  In response to his using the internet for freewheeling debate, they engaged in some bugging that is illegal under Washington State law.  It is illegal to use bugging without the knowledge of the participants.
He has developed a technique for identifying when someone is tailing him.  Found this on Father's day when some people got a little too close to him.  He drove to his Sister's party on Hayden Island in Oregon, and noticed the tails.  Identified them as Rixen Marine, which he thinks is a sham, another front organization.  One of the reasons he was arrested (though they're not willing to admit it) is because was way too successful in tailing _them_.  A few more days and he would have blown their entire operation.
He couldn't go into the details of how he found out these things. Did research & sophisticated observation. Will be getting friends to do searches in databases, etc. to gather more info to substantiate his suspicions.
He said his recent arrest was on a probation violation charge - failure to pay a fine or something, wasn't clear on the specifics.  There will be a hearing on his case this Friday the 10th.
Prosecutors last year didn't know what the govmt was up to - not told of the spying (a "black operation").  Their method of spying on him are techniques which are possible, though rarely used.  If people knew they would be very surprised.  It will be a big story - big as Watergate - when it comes out.  Their usage of these high-tech methods for access is difficult, so not used often.    The government is trying to cover up their reaction to what he wrote in his essays.

Dave Emery's remarks on government access to
keystrokes (proposed by the NYT as an alternative
to GAK) points to the probable increase of intrusive
devices to counter increasing use of encryption
and other privacy and anonymity measures.
This topic comes up here now and then, with
mentions of a slew of methods to protect privacy of data during transmission or storage. But the possibility
of logging the initial creation or manipulation of data is
not as often discussed, nor how to tie a person to
the data, as now being asked in legal and law
enforcement fora to identify, catch, convict and
jail computer culprits.
That the NYT floated the idea surely means someone
is testing public response to an idea that seems to
be more intrusive than GAK: the logging of initial
data and any manipulation of it, prior to encrypting,
and maybe including a means to link the actions to
the user.
If this is logging (and related retrieval) is done covertly, encryption could thereby become a falsely reassuring cloak of privacy.
Dave thinks devices like these are surely in the works,
and he can say more about their sponsors, technologies and implementations.
One driving force, as he previously noted, is the desire
for devices to assure copyright protection, backed by the WIPO treaty, which now being considered for approval. See the House report on it at:
     (141K)
And the EFF and ACLU opposition to it:
   hr2281-opp.htm
Other forces, though, are employers who want to snoop,
law enforcement, government, marketers, actually the
same groups who dislike privacy protection measures,
but often prefer to snoop covertly while loudly proclaiming
support for privacy.
Thus, the more general question Dave has raised is how
widespread is the development and implementation of
technolgies for covert surveillance on the Web and in desktop boxes -- happily spreading quietly while attention is focussed on the very encryption which it will circumvent?
And what are these devices, or what might they be, what might be countermeasures and who might be working for and against them. SDA must have insights to share.

DoD released today the text of a June 11 speech which
describes how the military is planning for the first time
in US history to establish a homeland defense command,
to operate inside US borders for protection against terrorism
and weapons of mass destruction:
   A special unit will handle cyber threats.
The CINC-US will be a vast increase over the traditional
role of domestic law enforcement by FBI, ATF and other
federal, state and local authorities, lately supplemented
by the National Guard, FEMA, PCCIP, and the newly
formed COIA at Commerce and the President's special office on domestic terrorism.
Deputy Secretary of Defense Hamre said the command
will work with the newly formed Defense Threat Reduction
Agency (DTRA) which will be under C4I of DoD.
Another press release today covered Hamre's June 22 speech in Vienna where he outlined similar measures for European defense through NATO:
   Finally, the Wash Post had a report today on DoD's
attempt to come up with workable plans for offensive
cyberwar -- which is claimed to be the serious first serious competitor for the nuclear threat in fifty years:
   It says that a component of cyberwar offense is regular prowling
of other countries networks and military command systems for the purpose of "pre-planning the battlefield."
That this is the way DoD justifies ignoring the limitations of intel agencies' need to get presidential approval for invading the borders of other countries. "Cyberspace is borderless," says the Pentagon.
Many covert prowling, surveilling and crashing tools
are in operation or poised to take down systems like those
of the nuclear command and control systems of Pakistan and India should the need arise. One guy
brags that any one of a dozen experts in the US "could take out a country in six hours" by disrupting
cyber infrastructure, and that might be looming for
the US.
Is it true infowar, or is it whistling in the dark psy war:
"my megaherz-death bombers are sneakier than yours"?

Remarks by Deputy Secretary of Defense John J. Hamre
Commemorating the 200th Anniversary of the Recall of George Washington to Active Duty
Mount Vernon, Virginia
Saturday, July 4, 1998
Two hundred years ago, Washington was called back to service to prepare America's defenses.  Today, the American homeland faces a new and different danger.  The threat is not from overt invasion, but from the sinister dangers of chemical, biological and cyber warfare.  Chemical and biological weapons are a poor man's atomic bomb.  They are easier to build, to hide, and to deliver to their targets.  They are especially appealing to small terrorist cells and known individuals who can not challenge American military superiority on the battlefield.
As in Washington's time, America is not yet fully prepared for this new challenge. We too must organize, plan, and act anew. We too must recognize that complacency and delay is dangerous. President Clinton and Secretary of Defense Cohen have made preparing the American homeland against chemical and biological weapons a top priority.  The continental United States has not confronted a direct threat to its territory in this century precisely because we have confronted threats before they touched our shores.  But this is a new era, where adversaries can bring their fight to our doorstep.  National security now must assume a new dimension.
The Department of Defense and the intelligence community must work hand in hand with law enforcement to deal with this far-reaching threat.  We are taking steps to improve our knowledge of hostile elements and their plans.  We are reorganizing the Defense Department to integrate our approach to counter-proliferation of these terrible new weapons, and we are launching new programs to help local emergency response forces to mitigate the effects of chemical and biological attack.
Shortly, we will commemorate this day by planting a new tree, adding to Washington's beloved "shades of Mount Vernon."  We place it here as a mark of gratitude to a leader who accepted the burdens of public service to defend our young republic.  We also place it here to mark our commitment to ensure future generations will live in peace and security.  One hundred years from now we will not be here, but I hope Americans will gather under this tree to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Washington's act of patriotic sacrifice.  And I hope they will also say, of us, that we too left a measure of our day and, by our deeds, we too preserved the safety of this sweet land of liberty.
Thank you all for coming today.

The New York Times, July 12, 1998:
Danger of Encryption
To the Editor:
Re "Privacy in the Digital Age" (editorial, July 6): No law enforcement agency is "trying hard to prevent the growing use of encryption." But encryption represents a serious public safety concern. We are open to any solution that recognizes that it is the ability to collect electronic evidence that has allowed us to prevent airliners from being bombed and to put major drug dealers behind bars.
Key escrow is one possible solution. There are others, and certainly a statutory scheme can be devised that will all but eliminate any risk of abuse by law enforcement. But if we do not allow for court-ordered access, for the first time in the history of this country a court order for seizure of evidence will be an absolute nullity.
We want to work with industry on a real solution, recognizing that those who acquire encryption over the Internet or from abroad naively make assumptions about the security it affords. We are not fighting encryption, but we know what will happen if technology cannot be made to work for law enforcement as it works for criminals and terrorists.    Louis J. FREEH

Despite extremely hazardous conditions that made recovery very difficult, the U.S. personnel believed that they recovered all recoverable U.S. parts and components that survived the launch No identifiable parts or components associated with the Telemetry Tracking and Control Encryption devices [TT&C], and the circuit board on which it was mounted, were recovered. We have been advised by Loral that the devices were embedded on a tray mounted within the Command Processor Box  of the satellite. lf this is the case, it is highly unlikely that the devices survived the crash because of the crash impact and high temperatures produced by the burning rocket propellants. According to Loral, the Command Processor Box was located adjacent to the propellant tanks and U.S. personnel at the site recovered only 30% of the box.
The COMSEC circuit board consisted of a printed wiring board and forty
plus, off-the-shelf and semi-custom discrete small sca]e integrated circuit chips. The COMSEC board is somewhat large and relatively fragile (about 6x10 inches), with interconnecting "tracks" on the board which interconnect the many logic devices into the COMSEC algorithm. As such a whole circuit board, its whole composite set of pieces, and the whole set of logic chips need to be recovered to succeed in reengineering the design of the device. If Loral's assessment of the physical implementation of the two COMSEC devices aboard INTELSAT 708 and the extent of damage to the command processor from the crash, impact and fire are correct, NSA and DTSA believe that it is highly unlikely that these items could have been recovered in sufficient detail to reverse In the unlikely event that the Chinese were able to recover all the items fully intact, it is important to note that the encryption board involved many embedded devices. Any loss of the chips and associated encryption algorithm would have have only minimal impact on national security because the INTELSAT 708 satellite was uniquely keyed.

This is fact, not the media kind: I've tried to reach Dimitri
by phone a few times since Termination, indeed Mr. T.
helped me find a working number (forwarded to his own). A lady sounding like Guy there took my name, number and request for DM to call. But he hasn't. He just keeps posting
as Guy, as Tim, as Nuri, muliple Adams, Johns, Jims, Peters,
anons, and  so on, each of the imposters posing as others.
Remember this fact, Tim/Dimitri were in cahoots to nuke the legacy toaderpunks from day one, pretending to be halves
of evil twins. (Note the overlapping name spelling.)
Still, shifting back to media, the five of us in Manhattan --
Perry, Dimitri, Guy, Duncan (Ray's in Brooklyn -- hundreds more don't openly affinity) hate each other's guts with infinite passion as is the duty of citizens competing for dole here, especially since 20 millions of us are on the dole, thank you Mr. Roosevelt for legalizing taxing/extoriting/wall streeting
the rest of the globe beyond the Hudson and Fire Island, from itzy-ritzy bankers to scum of the media sapoid. Primarily, though, our full-time role is to hide from each other and the vengeful planet, have our machines say things like, speak to my agent, my lawyer, my mate, then flip a switch
to the voice of the referent saying things like, he's not in, he's traveling, he's away, his son's just been killed skiing, he'll get back, cackle like Freddie.
Shifting back to fact: Dimitri's lady who took my name was:
Dimitri, Guy, Perry, Duncan, Ray, any of Dimitri's manifold
enemies and friends, any of you. Who knows who's here?
Nothing I've seen proves cypherpunks exists: I've seen Ray
twice and he wasn't the same. I've seen Duncan twice and
he wasn't the same. Neither recognized me either. We've
all introduced ourselves to Jim Kallstrom as one another,
and did the same to several of Kallstrom's stand-ins. Mark this: "Perry Metzger" for certain is non-existent, it's only
a mail drop, a chalk mark, a can by the road, a highly paid
fictional security scam: Pay or plonk. Cooped cops and holed-up criminals do, up the kazoo.
I say for a fact the crypto/cypherpunk/cops/spooks game's one bird doing a solo dance. Who that bird is, works for, remains to be reported reliably: an impossibility by definition. 100 to 1 it's a rogue bot, buried in a bridge caisson, powered by tidal flow or planetary rotation, unstoppable until earth freezes,
burns or implodes to infinite deception.
Dimitri was not terminated, can't be, he never was, like the rest
of us highly classified phantasms. Adam Back got the story
right, he's exchanging messages with a bot mirroring his inner evil, call that Tim, call it Dimitri, he'll call back as the One True

Lead story, The New York Times, July 20, 1998:
Clinton Plans to Assign Codes, as Law Requires, to Create Giant Medical Database As legislation that would protect patient privacy languishes in Congress, the Clinton Administration is quietly laying plans to assign every American a "unique health identifier," a computer code that could be used to create a national database that would track every citizen's medical history from cradle to grave.
The electronic code was mandated by a 1996 law and would be the first comprehensive national identification system since the Social Security number was introduced in 1935. Although the idea has attracted almost no public attention, it is so contentious that Federal health officials who were supposed to propose a plan for the identifier by February, have made little headway and are instead holding hearings beginning on Monday to solicit public comment. Proponents, including insurance companies and public health researchers, say the benefits would be vast. Doctors and hospitals would be able to monitor the health of patients as they switch from one insurance plan to the next. Patients would not have to wade through a cumbersome bureaucracy to obtain old records. Billing would be streamlined, saving money. A national disease database could be created, offering unlimited opportunities for scientific study. But opponents, including privacy advocates and some doctors' groups, say the code smacks of Big Brother. They warn that sensitive health information might be linked to financial data or criminal records and that already tenuous privacy protections would be further weakened as existing managed care databases, for example, are linked. They say that trust in doctors, already eroded by managed care, would deteriorate further, with patients growing reluctant to share intimate details. And in a world where computer hackers can penetrate the Pentagon's computer system, they ask, will anyone's medical records be safe?

"The Long, Strong Arm of the NSA," about the
Agency's methods of enforcing export obedience
with intimidation, delay and obfuscation:
 User manual: Dodging the rules  By Ellen Messmer Network World,  The National Security Agency (NSA) wrote the export rules on encryption. But from the point of view of corporations that want to ship U.S. software to their foreign offices, getting around the U.S. export rules is a top priority.
 And even for those who used to work at the NSA, it's still a challenge.
 "Well, I wrote those export rules when I was at the NSA," confessed Russell Davis, now chief of information technology security at SBC Warburg Dillon Read, a division of Swiss Bank Corp., which operates in 77 countries. Since joining the corporate life, Davis has used his knowledge of the NSA to find ways to work around the export system on behalf of his customer, the bank, which uses a lot of encryption-based security gear.
 "It took 17 months to figure out how to get crypto-based smart cards to Swiss facilities and elsewhere," Davis said. "But I wrote the rules on all this, and I know how to get around them." Would he ever consider using government-
approved data-recovery?
 "Never," Davis declared. "My customers come first!"
 "Our customers just aren't going to buy these types of products," said Tom Carty, vice president of business development for GTE CyberTrust. He agreed the government is leading industry down a path to build products few users will willingly buy.

@_subject: Jim Bell Rage 
Received from anonymous July 26, 1998:
The Columbian (Oregon), No date.
Written by John Branton, Columbian staff writer
Eleven months in prison - and counting - haven't muzzled
James Dalton Bell's rage about what he calls government
"black operations" against him. "This story has more
government misbehavior than Watergate", Bell wrote in a
recent letter to The Columbian.
He added in a phone call"I'm in a little bit of danger.
These people don't want me talking to you."
Bell is the 39-year-old McLoughlin Heights man who wrote
an Internet essay, "Assassination Politics", that
proposed the bounty-driven murder of "government
slimeballs". The former electronics engineer hadn't
spoken to The Columbian for about a year, until recently.
He was released from federal prison in April.
Bell served 11 months after pleading guilty to using
false Social Security numbers and obstructing the
Internal Revenue Service by trying to intimidate agents
and stink bombing their Vancouver office. Bell returned
to his parents' home this spring but was free only
about two months. Currently, Bell is back in a federal
prison in Seattle, awaiting a July 31 hearing on charges
that he violated his probation conditions. He's alleged
to have refused a court-ordered mental-health evaluation
and search of his parents' home.
Who is this man, many people have asked, who lives in our
midst when he isn't in prison - and if the IRS is to be
believed, dabbled with things such as nerve gas, botulism
toxin and sodium cyanide? IRS agents say Bell published a
"hit list" of agents' home addresses on the Internet for
his anti-government "patriot" friends, and discussed
contaminating water supplies with a buddy.
Is IRS Inspector Jeff Gordon correct in comparing Bell to
Timothy McVeigh and Theodore Kaczynski and saying the IRS
interrupted him in plans to commit murder? No, says Bell. "They knew I wasn't planning to kill federal agents",
Bell said this month. "They were scared because I had
written something that shows a way to eliminate
government. They were afraid I could convince the public
that I could replace existing government for no more than
a 10th or 20th of its current cost."
His wariness of the federal government is understandable
- they put him in prison. But his words reveal a view of
governmental duplicity like the fictional world of X-
Files agents Mulder and Scully. "Paranoid would be a good
word", said Bell's federal probation officer, Matthew
Richards. Bell, asked why he doesn't obey his court-
ordered probation terms to stay out of prison, made a
reference to the political imprisonment of Nelson
Mandela, South Africa's president. "I believe that when
the federal government decided to spy on me, simply
because of my political opposition to their tyranny and
terrorism, it dramatically diverged from what the average
American citizen would be inclined to tolerate", Bell
wrote recently.
Beginning in late 1995 or early 1996, Bell said, federal
agents read his "Assassination Politics" essay, posted on
the Internet. The essay described a computerized system
to ward "untraceable digital cash" to anyone who
correctly predicted the exact time of a federal agent's
murder. In Bell's words, "Imagine for a moment that, as
ordinary citizens were watching the evening news, they
see an act by a government employee or officeholder that
they feel violates their rights, abuses the public's
trust or misuses the powers that they feel should be
limited. What if they could go to their computers, type
in the miscreant's name, and select a dollar amount. If
0.1 percent of the population, or one person in a
thousand, was willing to pay $1 to see some government
slimeball dead, that would be in effect, a $250,000
bounty on his head."
Alarmed, Bell says, federal agents used two homes near
his parent's home, one on Corregidor Road and the other
on Mississippi Drive, for a clandestine and possibly
illegal surveillance operation. Agents supposedly
installed thousands of dollars worth of sophisticated
equipment, possibly using microwave technology, to spy on
Bell. "None of that occurred", said federal probation
officer Richards. "Absolutely not true", said the owner
of one of the houses. "I wouldn't let the feds in my
Bell said he suspects the agents bugged his phone
illegally - and followed him when he got out of prison
briefly in April. "We never bugged his phone", Richards
said. "No tailing whatsoever". Once, Bell said, he
spotted someone following him and turned the tables on
them. Bell followed the car to Rixen's Enterprises, 2700
N. Hayden Island Drive, which he suspects is a secret
front for a federal "black operation".
"No spooks here", said the owner, Jim Rixen, 40, who said
he deals in heating systems for boats and recreational
vehicles. "I've had this company for 13 years. You can
ask anybody on this island. You're more than welcome to
come here and go through everything I've got. He might
have followed some customer of mine here. I've never
heard anything about it."
In his upcoming hearing in the U.S. District Court in
Tacoma, the government will charge Bell with additional -
so far undisclosed - probation violations, Richards said.
If Bell has any actual evidence of illegal practices by
the government, that would be the place to bring it up.

The National Security Agency is losing ground in the fight
to keep hard-to-find cryptography experts from being lured
to greener pastures.
By Richard Lardner
Price Waterhouse didn't become a force in the consulting
world by ignoring market trends. So it was no surprise when
the firm decided to expand its information security
operation. After all, the Internet has completely changed
the way business is done: Paper is out, electrons are in.
But just as electronic commerce is skyrocketing, so too are
the odds that sensitive corporate information might be
tampered with as it travels through cyberspace. With the private sector beginning to recognize that the
digital door swings both ways, there's growing demand for
the "risk management" services Price Waterhouse and other
companies are offering to help keep the hackers at bay. To
snare these potential clients, the company needed to hire
hundreds of information technology professionals. Trouble
is, information protection may be a huge growth area, but
the talent pool is mighty shallow. So officials at Price Waterhouse did what many other
commercial enterprises have done, and continue to do. They
targeted a group of employees at the Defense Department's
secretive National Security Agency, where thousands of the
federal government's best and brightest spend their days
eavesdropping on other countries while at the same time
ensuring that U.S. information networks are secure. Because
of the highly sensitive missions the agency performs,
companies like Price Waterhouse know they are getting
employees who are extremely good at what they do and are
solid citizens too-NSA is picky about whom it hires and
conducts thorough background investigations. Full text:

Source:     Title: New Independent Research Foundation Backed by Microsoft
                Embargoed until 11.00 Friday 29th May
Too often, policy issues relating to information technology are
seperately debated by two distinct grouups: technology experts and
those focused on social concerns.  Policy makers face the challenge of
reconciling the seperate debates in areas where technology is often
evolving very quickly. A new research foundation aims to provide clear
advice that spans this gap and is independent of vested interests.
The Foundation for Information Policy Research will fund research into
how information technology affects society. It is launched at a press
conference on Friday 29th May at 11.00 am. (1)
Microsoft has contributed a six-figure sum to cover the launch costs.
Internet service providers Poptel and Demon are also supporting the
Foundation. Its independence will be guaranteed, however, by a board
of trustees. (2) In the medium term it will be supported by
subscriptions from a range of firms in commerce and industry.
The goal of the Foundation is to promote research and understanding of
the effects, and the likely future effects, of IT on society. Its
areas of investigation include: (3)
 * the regulation of electronic commerce;
 * consumer protection;
 * data protection and privacy;
 * copyright;
 * law enforcement;
 * evidence and archiving;
 * electronic interaction between government, businesses and individuals;
 * the extent to which various information technologies discriminate
   against the less advantaged members of society; and
 * the new risks that computer and communication systems pose to
   life, health and economic well-being
The Foundation will also provide a valuable resource for the press as
it will be able to put journalists in touch with a wide range of
experts who can explain IT issues as they arise.

         Ross Anderson (Chair of the Foundation)    01223 334733
The Director of the Foundation, Caspar Bowden, said: ``The IT policies
(and failures) which the current government inherited, and the
decisions which will be made by them in the future, will have
far-reaching effects on who society's winners and losers will be.  We
have a duty to prevent technological innovation and development taking
place at the expense of the poor, the old, the sick and the disabled.
We believe that so long as we understand the social and policy
implications of new technical innovations, we can make IT into a means
to facilitate social inclusion. The Foundation's mission will be to
achieve and to spread that understanding.''
The Managing Director of Microsoft UK, David Svendsen, said: ``It's
important that we contribute to a broad and informed public discussion
on these information society issues.''
The Chair of the Foundation, Ross Anderson of Cambridge University,
said: ``We welcome this new source of funding for IT related
research. An increase in the diversity of funding sources is almost
always a good thing, and the Foundation will be particularly valuable
as much of the available IT funding is directed to very short-term and
narrowly technical agendas.''
(1) The press conference is at the "Scrambling for Safety"
conference, at the Bloomsbury Theatre, University College, London.
URL: (2) The Foundation's Director and full-time CEO, Caspar Bowden, has
for the last three years been running Qualia, a consultancy business
specialising in internet implementations. Before that he was a
financial strategist with Goldman Sachs. He also researched IT and
communications issues for Scientists for Labour. Its chair, Ross Anderson, is a faculty member at Cambridge University
Computer Laboratory and has done extensive research on topics related
to electronic commerce.
The "Millennium Bug" - the problem that many computers cannot deal
correctly with the date roll-over from 1999 to 2000 - threatens to
cause havoc with many systems and has been declared a national
emergency by the Prime Minister.
Another problem that has worried policymakers and concerned citizens
is that new developments in IT may discriminate against the less well
off members of society.  For example, the current mechanisms for
electronic commerce depend on consumers using their credit cards to
order goods and services over the net. They often get a big discount
for buying this way; but people without credit cards may lose out.
The first task that the Foundation has set itself is to examine the
underpinnings of electronic commerce. The European Commission has
recently published a draft Directive on this subject and will launch a
period of public consultation at the same conference at which the
Foundation itself will be launched. (The draft directive is at
Other topics which the Foundation plans to investigate include:
* the maintenance of public records in electronic form. We do not
 fully understand how to ensure that word processor files and other
 electronic documents created today can be safely stored for many
 years, and reliably made available in the future. This affects not
 just the new Freedom of Information Act, but also the work of future
 librarians and historians.
* the development of copyright law. There are some industry proposals
 which would restrict the ability of libraries to lend out digital
 works. Will this mean the end of the public library, as more and more
 books, videos and other material become digital? What are the
 implications for schools and universities? What are the implications
 for the public, if all major sports events in future are pay-per-view?
 Are these developments inevitable, or is there something we can do
 about them?
* the introduction of electronic communication between the citizen and
 the government has the potential to cut queues and the frustration of
 dealing with people on the phone. However, are these changes
 intrinsically more likely to favour the articulate, and to bring the
 most benefit to well-off people with their own computers? What
 technical developments are reasonably possible to ensure that all
 citizens get a fair deal?
* the previous government's proposal for a "personal signature card"
 that would give access to all government services had a distinct
 flavour of an ID card. Are such developments necessary, or can we
 find workable alternatives?
* the police are concerned about the spread of prepaid mobile phones,
 which are increasingly used by stalkers and extortionists. However, if
 they are banned, then how would people without credit cards obtain a
 mobile phone service?
* there have been many disputes in the past over "phantom withdrawals"
 from bank cash machines, and banks have defended themselves by
 claiming that their computers cannot be wrong. How can this approach
 work when millions of merchants are selling services through a wide
 variety of computer systems? What will consumer rights amount to in
 the information age?
* the failure of government computer systems - whether spectacular
 failure due to the millennium bug, or the continuing sporadic
 failures in the NHS - does most harm to pensioners, the disabled,
 single mothers, the unemployed and people on NHS waiting lists (who
 are typically elderly, female and working class). How can we
 encourage best engineering practice in the public sector?

There are accusations from Russia and France that
PGP International and Network Associates are
improperly and probably illegally refusing downloads
of PGP to legitimate users.       Phil Zimmermann and the companies have been asked by the plaintiffs to explain why public affirmations of open access are contradicted by illegal restrictions.
Could this be due to pressure from US agencies or
legal counsel to comply with covert directives of the
nations to restrict access or pay the price of being
denied markets?
Maybe this is the way the Stewart Baker policy of encryption
duplicity is being spread from NSA to the marketeers: Public assurances of concern and covert arrangements with authority
to assure perpetuation of national security lockdown.

   Public Letter to Kofi Annan
             June 1, 1998              Mr. Kofi Annan              Secretary General              United Nations              New York, New York              United States              Dear Secretary General,              On the occasion of the United Nations General Assembly Special
             Session on Drugs in New York on June 8-10, 1998, we seek your
             leadership in stimulating a frank and honest evaluation of global
             drug control efforts.              We are all deeply concerned about the threat that drugs pose to
             our children, our fellow citizens and our societies. There is no
             choice but to work together, both within our countries and across
             borders, to reduce the harms associated with drugs. The United
             Nations has a legitimate and important role to play in this
             -- but only if it is willing to ask and address tough
questions about
             the success or failure of its efforts.              We believe that the global war on drugs is now causing more
             harm than drug abuse itself.              Every decade the United Nations adopts new international
             conventions, focused largely on criminalization and punishment,
             that restrict the ability of individual nations to devise
             solutions to local drug problems. Every year governments enact
             more punitive and costly drug control measures. Every day
             politicians endorse harsher new drug war strategies.              What is the result? U.N. agencies estimate the annual revenue
             generated by the illegal drug industry at $400 billion, or the
             equivalent of roughly eight per cent of total international
             This industry has empowered organized criminals, corrupted
             governments at all levels, eroded internal security, stimulated
             violence, and distorted both economic markets and moral values.
             These are the consequences not of drug use per se, but of
             decades of failed and futile drug war policies.              In many parts of the world, drug war politics impede public
             efforts to stem the spread of HIV, hepatitis and other infectious
             diseases. Human rights are violated, environmental assaults
             perpetrated and prisons inundated with hundreds of thousands of
             drug law violators. Scarce resources better expended on health,
             education and economic development are squandered on ever
             more expensive interdiction efforts. Realistic proposals to
             drug-related crime, disease and death are abandoned in favor of
             rhetorical proposals to create drug-free societies.              Persisting in our current policies will only result in more drug
             abuse, more empowerment of drug markets and criminals, and
             more disease and suffering. Too often those who call for open
             debate, rigorous analysis of current policies, and serious
             consideration of alternatives are accused of "surrendering." But
             the true surrender is when fear and inertia combine to shut off
             debate, suppress critical analysis, and dismiss all
alternatives to
             current policies. Mr. Secretary General, we appeal to you to
             initiate a truly open and honest dialogue regarding the future of
             global drug control policies - one in which fear, prejudice and
             punitive prohibitions yield to common sense, science, public
             health and human rights. There are a gang of heads of state gathering at the UN, with
cavalcades of limosines and guards racing around Manhattan
to indifference, except for me, the only one jumping hurray at the
sirens, whirling lights and bristling vans. All the SS guys facing backwards finger shot my middle digit aimed at them, then a sniper behind me put a red dot on it, scaring me shitless, I ran

[Congressional Record: June 17, 1998 (Senate)]
                               ENCRYPTION
  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today out of concern for our nation's
computer and electronic industries. As you are well aware, the
[[Page S6438]]
export policies prohibit American companies from selling state-of-the-
art encryption technology abroad without recovery keys and back door
access. Encryption is a series of mathematical formulas that scramble
and unscramble data and communications. It is used to thwart computer
hackers, industrial and foreign espionage agents, and criminals from
gaining access to and reading sensitive personal, business, and
military communications. The higher the bit-key length, the more
difficult it is for unauthorized persons to break the code. Technically
advanced encryption ensures that an individual's medical, financial,
business, personal records and electronic-mail cannot be accessed
without their consent. The Administration is now promoting the
deployment of recovery keys so designated third parties would be able
to access and share with law enforcement the computer data and
communications of American citizens without their knowledge. Currently,
government mandated key escrow is not required and is opposed by the
computer industry, privacy advocates, legal scholars, and by many
members of Congress.
  Mr. LEAHY. While current law does not mandate any key recovery, the
current Administration, just as past Administrations, uses the export
control regime to ``dumb down'' the encryption available for widespread
integration into high-tech products intended for both domestic use and
for export to foreign customers. Export regulations in place now are
being used expressly to coerce the development and use of encryption
products capable of giving law enforcement surreptitious access to
plaintext by conditioning the export of 56-bit DES encryption on
development of key recovery features.
  These regulations are scheduled to sunset in December 1998, at which
time export of even 56-bit strength encryption will no longer be
permitted. I understand that the Administration is already undertaking
discussions with industry on what will happen upon sunset of these
regulations. I have long contended that taking unilateral steps will
not resolve this issue, but instead could delay building the consensus
we so urgently need. This issue simply cannot by resolved by Executive
  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I have been involved in the debate
regarding encryption technology and privacy for more than three years
now. In the course of that time I have not seen any real attempt by the
White House to resolve this problem. In fact, over the course of that
time the Administration has moved further from negotiation by taking
increasingly extreme positions on this critical national issue.
  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as you have heard, current U.S. policy
allows only encryption below the 56-bit key length to be sold abroad.
For a long time now, software companies have argued that this level of
encryption is so low it provides little security for the information
being transmitted over the ``super highway.'' This policy also states
that, in the production of encryption stronger than 56-bit, software
companies must provide some type of ``backdoor'' access to ensure law
enforcement can decode encrypted material.
  Addressing this from an economic perspective, customers--especially
foreign customers--are unwilling to purchase American encryption
products with backdoors and third-party access. This is particularly
true since they can buy stronger encryption overseas from either
foreign-owned companies or American owned companies on foreign soil
without these invasive features.
  Mr. WYDEN. Since coming to the Senate, I have worked side-by-side
with Senators Burns, Ashcroft, Leahy and others on the critical issue
of encryption. Our common goal has been to craft a policy that puts the
United States squarely out front of the crypto-curve, rather than locks
us permanently behind it. A one-size-fits-all government policy simply
won't work in this digital era. We all recognize and acknowledge the
legitimate needs of law enforcement and the national security
communities, but tying the hands of America's high technology industry
in the process will serve neither those needs, nor the national
interest in maintaining our competitive edge in the fiercely
competitive global marketplace. It's time to move forward with
comprehensive encryption reform legislation.
  Mr. BURNS. I would like to point out that the government's plan for
encryption--whether they call it ``key escrow'' or ``key recovery'' or
``plaintext access''--simply won't work. Eleven of the world's most
prominent computer security experts have told us government mandated
key recovery won't work because it won't be secure, as explained in a
study published this week by the Center for Democracy and Technology.
Key escrow also won't work because it will cost billions, as revealed
in a recent study published by the Business Software Alliance. We have
also been told that the kind of system the Administration wants is not
technically feasible. Additionally, constitutional scholars testified
that government mandated key escrow, third party recovery probably
violates the Bill of Rights.
  Mr. LOTT. Even though a national recovery system would be technically
unfeasible, costly, and violates an individual's privacy rights, the
Administration continues to require key escrow as a precondition for
relaxing America's encryption policy. Again, Mr. President, I would
point out that state-of-the-art encryption is available in the
international marketplace without key recovery and without backdoor
access. This backdoor door requirement is simply backward thinking
policy. It does not make sense to hold the computer industry hostage to
force the creation of such an unworkable system.
  Mr. BURNS. The Majority Leader is absolutely right. We do not need
experts to tell us key recovery will not work. All that is needed is a
little common sense to understand that no one will buy systems with
backdoor access. Criminals will not escrow their keys and terrorists
will find keyless systems from America's foreign competitors. There is
nothing we can do to stop undesirables from using strong, unescrowed
  Mr. LOTT. Even though advanced encryption products are widely
available across the globe, the White House continues to stall
Congressional and industry attempts to reach a sensible market oriented
solution to the nation's outdated encryption export regime. This
stonewalling tactic will only cede even more of our nation's technology
market to foreign competitors and America will lose forever its ability
to sell encryption technology at home and abroad.
  It is time to change America's export policy before it is too late.
If the Administration will not do what is right, reform its export
regime, then Congress must enact encryption reform during this session.
  Mr. LEAHY. The Majority Leader is correct that reform of our
encryption policy is needed. The Attorney General came to the Hill in
March and asked for a legislative moratorium on encryption matters.
This request was made because the Administration wanted to talk with
the information technology industry about developing means for law
enforcement to gain surreptitious access to plaintext scrambled by
strong encryption. According to eleven of the world's leading
cryptographers in a report reissued on June 8, the technical risks and
costs of such backdoors ``will exacerbate, not alleviate, the potential
for crime and information terrorism'' for America's computer users and
our critical infrastructures.
  In the Senate we have a name for debate that delays action on
legislative matters. We call it a filibuster. On encryption policy, the
Administration has been willing to talk, but not to forge a real
solution. That amounts to a filibuster. The longer we go without a
sensible policy, the more jobs will be lost, the more we risk eroding
our privacy rights on the Internet, and the more we leave our critical
infrastructures vulnerable.
  Mr. BURNS. We can readily see that the current U.S. policy on
encryption jeopardizes the privacy of individuals, the security of the
Internet, and the competitiveness of U.S. industry. We have been
debating this issue since the Administration's introduction of the ill-
fated Clipper chip proposal over five years ago. Yet no substantial
change in Administration policy has taken place. It is time for us to
take action.
  I first introduced comprehensive encryption reform legislation in the
[[Page S6439]]
form of the Pro-CODE bill over two years ago, then reintroduced it in
this Congress with the cosponsorship of the Majority Leader, Senators
Ashcroft, Leahy, Wyden, and others. Along with Senators Ashcroft,
Leahy, and others, I am also an original cosponsor of the E-PRIVACY
bill, which would foster the use of strong encryption and global
competitiveness. We have held numerous hearings on the issue. Yet
despite the increasingly desperate drumbeat of criticism from industry,
individuals, and privacy groups, from across the political spectrum,
the Administration's policy has remained fundamentally unchanged.
  Mr. LEAHY. Since the hearing I chaired in May 1994 on the
Administration's ``Clipper Chip'' proposal, the Administration has
taken some steps in the right direction. Clipper Chip is now dead, and
the Administration has transferred authority over the export of
encryption products from the State Department to the Commerce
Department, as called for in legislation I introduced in the last
Congress with Senators Burns, Wyden and others. Furthermore, the
Administration has permitted the export of up to 56-bit DES encryption,
at least until the end of this year. But these actions are simply not
enough for our high-tech industries to maintain their leading edge in
the global marketplace.
  Mr. ASHCROFT. Our technology companies need to be able to compete
effectively. Without reasonable export laws our technology sector will
be seriously harmed. More encryption companies will leave the country
so they are free to sell their products around the globe as well as
within the United States. Make no mistake, the market will not be
denied. Today, robust encryption products from Canada, Japan, Germany
and elsewhere are being sold on the world market. You have heard of the
companies that are manufacturing and selling encryption. They are
Nortel, Nippon and Seimens. These are not upstart companies. They are
substantial players on the international scene, and they offer
encryption products that are technically and financially competitive
with those produced in the U.S.
  Mr. LOTT. That's right. In fact, a recent survey conducted by Trusted
Information Systems found that hundreds of foreign companies sell over
600 encryption products from 29 countries. It is even possible to
download some of the strongest technology available, 128-bit key length
encryption, off of the Internet. Clearly, America's policy of
restricting the sale of American encryption software and hardware has
not impacted the availability and use of this technology throughout the
  No one disputes the fact that the development and use of robust
encryption worldwide will continue with or without U.S. business
participation. What is particularly disturbing to me is that export
controls, instead of achieving their intended purpose, have only served
to deny America's premier computer industry the opportunity to compete
on a level playing field with foreign competitors. Costing our economy
and our nation billions of dollars and the loss of countless American
jobs in the process. Given the wide availability of encryption
technology, continuing to restrict U.S. access to foreign markets makes
no sense.
  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is absolutely correct. The Administration's
encryption policy is, in effect, a tax on American consumers. We owe it
to these customers and the innovators in the software industry to
reform this encryption policy now. From the birth of the United States,
this country has been a world leader in innovation, creativity,
entrepreneurship, vision and opportunity. Today all of these American
attributes are on display in our technology sector. Whether in
telecommunications, or computer hardware or software, the United States
has maintained a leadership position because of the opportunities
afforded to people with the vision, determination and responsibility to
reach for their highest and best. We must work diligently to ensure
that ample opportunities are maintained in this country for our
technology sector to continue to thrive and innovate. If companies are
stifled and cannot compete, then the people, the ideas, the jobs, and
the economic growth will simply go elsewhere.
  Mr. BURNS. In the computer business these days, they talk about
``Internet time.'' In the Internet industry, where product life cycles
can be as low as 6 months, the world changes rapidly. Yet we have been
debating this issue for over five years now, while America's sensitive
communications go unsecured, our critical information infrastructures
go unprotected, and our electronic commerce jobs get shipped overseas.
It is time for the Congress to act.
  Mr. ASHCROFT. If this issue is not resolved, and resolved soon, we
will lose this industry, we will lose our leadership position in
technology, and our national security will suffer. We have a choice to
make as policy makers--do we allow our companies to compete
internationally or do we force them, by our antiquated and ill-
conceived government policy, to move overseas. We cannot simply ignore
the reality that robust encryption exists in the international
marketplace now. Instead, we must allow our companies to compete, and
do so now. We cannot allow extraneous issues to stand in the way of
remedying the deficiencies with our current approach to encryption. We
must recognize that keeping the encryption industry on American shores
is the best way to ensure national security. We would not think of
allowing all our defense industries to move abroad. By the same token,
we should not force the encryption industry abroad through outdated
policies. Simply put, strong encryption means a strong economy and a
strong country. This concern is just one of the many reasons we need to
pass effective encryption legislation this year and just one of the
reasons that Senator Leahy and I recently drafted the E-PRIVACY bill,
S. 2067.
  Mr. LEAHY. I join with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in
calling for passage of good encryption legislation that promotes
computer privacy, fosters the global competitiveness of our high-tech
industries, and encourages the widespread use of strong encryption as
an online crime prevention and anti-terrorism tool. The E-PRIVACY bill
that I have sponsored with Senator Ashcroft, Senator Burns and others,
satisfies these goals. Prompt Senate consideration of encryption
legislation is sorely needed to protect America's economy and security.
  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the E-PRIVACY bill seeks to protect
individual privacy, while at the same time addressing national security
and law enforcement interests. It would also modernize export controls
on commercial encryption products.
  The E-Privacy Act specifically addresses the concerns of law
enforcement. First and foremost, it makes it a crime to intentionally
use encryption to conceal incriminating communications or information.
It also provides that with an official subpoena, existing wiretap
authority can be used to obtain communications decryption keys/
assistance from third parties.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Leahy, Senator
Burns and Senator Ashcroft as well as Senator Lott and Senator Daschle
for their work and leadership on the issue of encryption. I am proud to
be an original cosponsor of S. 2067, the E-PRIVACY Act.
  This is my sixth year as a member of the Senate and the sixth year I
have advocated for reasonable legislation on encryption. Sadly, the
Administration has not been a constructive player in this debate. It is
time for the United States to acknowledge that we no longer exclusively
control the pace of technology. Purchasers around the world can
download software off of the Internet from any country by simply
accessing a website. Foreign purchasers have turned to Russian, German,
Swiss and other foreign vendors for their encryption needs.
  Washington state and American companies deserve the opportunity to
compete free from unreasonable government restrictions. Their role in
the international marketplace should be determined by their ingenuity
and creativity rather than an outdated, ineffectual system of export
controls. The time to act is now. I urge the Senate to consider the E-
PRIVACY Act at the earliest opportunity.
  Mr. BURNS. The basic facts remain the same. People need strong,
unescrowed encryption to protect themselves online in the information
[[Page S6440]]
age. Law enforcement has legitimate concerns about the spread of this
technology, and we must work to provide them the tools and expertise
they need to keep up with advances in encryption technology. We cannot
stop time, however. The genie is out of the bottle. As Bill Gates, the
CEO of Microsoft, recently said, ``Encryption technology is widely
available outside the United States and inside the United States, and
that's just a fact of life.''
  Mr. CRAIG. With the rapid expansion of the ``super highway'' and
Internet commerce it is crucial we bring encryption legislation to the
forefront. A secure, private and trusted national and global
information infrastructure is essential to promote citizens' privacy
and economic growth.
  Mr. BURNS. As my colleagues recognize, technically advanced and
unobtrusive encryption is fundamental to ensuring the kind of privacy
Americans will need and desire in the years to come. Congress must
choose a future where individuals and companies will have the tools
they need to protect their privacy, not a future where people fear the
use electronic commerce because they have no security.
  I commend the Majority Leader, Senators Ashcroft, Leahy, Craig,
Wyden, and Murray for their vision and bipartisan leadership on this
issue. I hope that Congress will be able to move forward with real
encryption reform legislation that protects the privacy and security of
Americans in the Information Age, before it is too late.
  Mr. LOTT. I think it is worth repeating to my colleagues that the
Administration's approach to encryption makes no sense. It is not good
policy. Continuing to restrict the foreign sale of American encryption
technology that is already available abroad, or will soon be available,
is anti-business, anti-consumer, anti-jobs, and anti-innovation.
  The time for a change in America's export regime is long overdue.
Unfortunately, the Administration continues to support its outmoded and
competition-adverse encryption control policy. That is why this
Congress needs to find a legislative solution to this issue.
  If America's export controls are not relaxed now, then Congress
places in peril our entire technology industry. Not just those
companies that create and market encryption products and services, but
virtually every company involved in the development and sale of
computer hardware and software. Congress cannot and will not put
America's entire technological base at risk for an ineffective and
outmoded export policy on encryption.

Most officials in Asia seem to have accepted the virtues of transparency, at least in the economic field.

Nevertheless, no matter how small, efficient, or cost-effective surveillance hardware becomes, there will always be limits to what technology can accomplish. Indeed, it is a double-edged sword--witness the polemics in Washington and on the Web over who, if anyone, should regulate electronic encryption. From untappable communications to pixel-by-pixel photo and video editing, technology is often as good at hiding secrets as it is at revealing them. Without a norm of transparency, technology will continue to protect private information as well as ferret it out.

arrested at his parents' home in Vancouver Monday about 1:07 a.m. PDT by five
federal marshals in two cars. The agents went in with guns drawn and came out
with Bell's elderly parents, with whom they talked for a while. A few minutes
later, they brought out Jim, who was handcuffed in front, dressed in a blue T-
shirt and slacks. He was put in the back of a red Jeep, and then leg chained
by an agent. (I tried to ask one of the agents if Jim was going to be taken
directly to Tacoma - my assumption - but the agent was a typical marshals
service jerk and just told me to stay away.)
Jim was in the backseat for about 20 minutes and then two agents came out and
drove him away - after one agent accidentally set off the Jeep "wa-wa" siren -
...just as TV arrived. the other three agents remained in the house, looking
for "evidence," i assume.
I expect him to appear before a federal magistrate in Tacoma tomorrow
morning. His federal defender still has not been provided any paper by the

The message about Jim's rearrest yesterday is confirmed,
except the time of arrest was 1:07 PM, not AM. The reporter
went by Jim's house after confirming that a bust was scheduled
and waited for the action.
Jim's been taken from Vancouver, WA, where he lives with his
parents, to either Spokane or Seattle, for a hearing before
a magistrate on the alleged parole violation. Jim's public
defender is on the matter.
No information on Jim's alleged violation, although the reporter
says supposedly there's a long list of prohibitions including one against going near a federal facility, "even a mailbox." Someone's trying to a get a copy of the list which should be public information.
Jim's appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court is presumably for reduction of the onerous prohibitions which may have
been made sever enough that he could be hauled in
whenever publicity is needed in the lucrative fight against "terrorism of the American people," a fever for funding that's feeding bucks into the bottomless pockets of US Justus Terrorists coming to call.

DoD Press Release, June 23, 1998:
No. 316-78
IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 23, 1998
           ENCRYPTION FORMULAS DECLASSIFIED
The Department of Defense today announced the decision by the National Security Agency to declassify both the Key Exchange Algorithm and the SKIPJACK encryption algorithm used in the FORTEZZA(tm) personal computer card. FORTEZZA(tm) provides security at the desktop in the Defense Message System and other DoD applications. This marks the first time that the NSA has declassified such information and made it commercially available. This declassification is an essential part of the Department of Defense's efforts to work with commercial industry in developing reasonably priced computer protection products. This declassification decision will enable industry to develop software and smartcard based security products, which are interoperable with FORTEZZA(tm). The availability of such products will enhance the protection of DoD's sensitive but unclassified and critical non-mission communications. The decision to release SKIPJACK (an 80 bit encryption algorithm that is not extensible to higher key lengths) and KEA (a 1024 bit key exchange algorithm) is restricted to these particular algorithms, and does not apply to other classified NSA algorithms. The SKIPJACK and KEA algorithms and their source codes have been declassified pursuant to Executive Order 12958. Vendors interested in obtaining more information on this matter should contact the National Security Agency Public Affairs Office at 301-688-6524.

CIA Head Forsees Better Hackers
Filed at 5:43 p.m. EDT
By The Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Intrusion into government computers will become increasingly more sophisticated and better organized and is likely to involve hostile nations, CIA Director George Tenet told lawmakers Wednesday. "Potential attackers range from national intelligence and military organizations, terrorists, criminals, industrial competitors, hackers and disgruntled or disloyal insiders," Tenet told the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee. "We know with specificity of several nations that are working on developing an information warfare capability." While Tenet did not identify the countries, committee Chairman Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who received a classified briefing on Tuesday, named some of them. Citing published reports, Thompson said China, Russia, Libya, Iraq and Iran and at least seven other countries are developing information warfare programs. The challenge facing U.S. intelligence will be to detect attacks on U.S.computers and information systems by organized or individual hackers. In some cases, Tenet said, disruptive intrusions orchestrated by hostile states may be disguised as amateurish efforts by individual hackers. "Our electric power grids and our telecommunications networks will be targets of the first order," Tenet said. "An adversary capable of implanting the right virus or accessing the right terminal can cause massive damage." The shift of the computer hacker problem from individuals and terrorist groups to governments is only beginning, Tenet said, but he added, "Down the line we are going to encounter more and it will be more organized." Tenet cited one case, without naming it, of a foreign government targeting the United States for intrusion into information systems. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., asked if the U.S. government is taking steps to develop its own offensive hacking capability to disrupt adversaries and to serve as a deterrent for computer-based attacks. "We're not asleep at the switch in this regard," Tenet replied. Air Force Lt. Gen. Kenneth Minihan, head of the National Security Agency, said it was not going too far to think in terms of an "electronic Pearl Harbor," a well-organized assault on the United States based on strikes aimed at electronic information systems. The most sensitive information centers, such as CIA and Pentagon classified files, are heavily guarded against such intrusion and, in most cases, are fenced off from Internet-type transfers. The problems are more likely to
arise in less well-guarded areas such as financial networks or industrial control centers. "They're not going to attack our strengths," Minihan said. A key area of vulnerability within the intelligence community, Tenet said, is the possibility of a disloyal or disgruntled employee wreaking havoc with CIA computers. Another scenario stems from the difficulty the CIA is
encountering finding enough software specialists to grapple with the "Year 2000" problem, caused by computers not being programmed to recognize the shift in the calendar from 1999 to 2000. Most of the contractors available to help the agency, Tenet said, would use foreigners, affording "an easy opportunity to come in and see how your system works and what your vulnerabilities are." The running debate over the availability of increasingly sophisticated encryption technology, which scrambles messages and data from unauthorized intrusion, also poses a worry, Tenet said. Unless the computer industry and the government find a legislative compromise, the government could fall victim to hackers able to hide their own actions in impenetrable encryption codes. It may take a major computer-hacker incident to create the political pressure needed to allow
the government the "recovery" power to access encrypted databases. "There is a train wreck waiting to happen unless we deal with the recovery aspect of the encryption debate," Tenet said.

NYT, June 27, 1998:
Getting Back to Basics, C.I.A. Is Hiring More Spies Taking steps to reduce dependence on high-tech spying. By James Risen
Washington, June 26--The Central Intelligence Agency is beginning the largest recruitment drive for new spies in its history, in an ambitious effort to rebuild its espionage service, which has been severely damaged by spy scandals, budget cutbacks and high turnover since the end of the cold war, officials said.
With Congress already providing increased financing, the Directorate of Operations, the C.I.A.'s clandestine espionage arm, will hire record numbers of case officers
--spies-- beginning this year as part of a new strategic plan to repair the decaying espionage capabilities of the United States by 2005, officials said. In addition to expanded hiring, the agency also plans to reopen several overseas stations that were closed in the early 1990's after the demise of the Soviet Union led Congress and the White House to reduce the C.I.A.'s budget sharply. The recruitment plan is a sign that the C.I.A. recognizes that it has become far too dependent on so-called technical intelligence, or eavesdropping devices and spy satellites. Now, the agency wants to get back to espionage basics, by increasing its ability to place a spy behind enemy lines or inside the offices of a rival government. The spread of new technologies like encryption and computer networks has eroded the value of spy satellites and listening devices and has led the C.I.A. to see the need for an expanded cadre of spies. Without having an agent in place, the C.I.A. has found it much harder to gain access to secrets from rival governments, terrorists and international organized crime groups.  ...
The C.I.A. is recruiting case officers, and people to support them with technical skills that spies have rarely been asked to learn in the past. "As we tried to figure out our requirements for the future, we realized we needed to have greater technical support for agent operations," said one American official. At the top of the list of requirements is computer expertise. The proliferation of global computer data networks, for example, has made it more difficult for the agency to slip into a country using false identifications. Only computer experts can defeat those local computer systems, and even developing countries routinely make sophisticated computer checks on passports and visas. ...

Duncan Campbell has posted the message below on Echelon. Would anyone happen to have a copy of the 1988 New Statesman
article? If not, I'll dig it out of a library. More importantly, as Duncan asks, does anyone know of other original info on Echelon?
The original and primary source for information on ECHELON is an article I
wrote in New Statesman magazine ten years ago : NS, 12 August 1988 :
"They've got it taped".  In 1991, a UK World in Action programme added an important new detail about
the network, namely the presence of a DICTIONARY computer (a key part of
the system) at  GCHQ's processing centre in Westminster.  In 1993, I produced a documentary for Channel 4 - "The Hill" which related
ECHELON to the work of the Menwith Hill NSA field station near Harrogate in
Yorkshire.  In 1996, Nicky Hager in New Zealand described in his book "Secret Power"
the presence of DICTIONARY computers at two New Zealand sigint stations,
and gave extensive details of the local programming and tasking of the
ECHELON "dictionaries".  Apart from these sources, so far as I am aware all the reports that are
around are derivative and reprocessed.  The European Parliament STOA
committee report from the "Omega Foundation" is in this category and was in
fact submitted rather more than a year ago.  If anyone is aware of any
other *original* publication on this topic, could they post it. The arrival
in the public domain of original information in this area is a rarity, yet
is the foundation for the only things we "know" about the scale of NSA/GCHQ
surveillance and processing. Duncan Campbell

Tim's and Michael's exchanges (with others) are most welcome,
and constructively return us again to the most compelling aspect
of the encryption debate, the contest between law and technology,
one that has impact far beyond cryptography.
There are examples of the application of law to control of technology
in the President's most recent update of "The National Emergency Caused by the Lapse of the Export Administration Act of 1979":
   It recounts the activities of the Commerce Department -- mainly BXA --
for the latest 6-month reporting period, and lists as well the cases of penalties imposed for export violations. Some of these have been imposed for alleged violations over 6 years past. They exemplify what Tim and Michael are discussing of the various ways the regulations and laws are imposed according to policy shifts and wind direction of politicians. The report describes the beef up of BXA enforcement programs, and increasing coordination with and training of other countries for export enforcement.
All justified by a "national emergency" for which the underlying law
to control technology long ago lapsed. The lapse appears to be
a deliberate way to avoid having to define ahead of time what
technology is to be controlled in order that ad hoc policy and
regulations can be devised to fit, deal by deal.
This parallels the increase in indecipherable grand jury proceedings, plea bargainings and parole conditions, determined by protected
government employees. These, to be sure, appear to be close cousins of the bloated features of legacy technologies, civilian
and military.
It worth noting that Microsoft and the Justice Department are perfect twins of technology and law monopolies, using brute force and contracts to get their way, both clothed in self-righteousness and
both led by charming weirdos, both totally obsessed with each their own mad view of law and technology in the "public interest."
Still, there's some public benefit that these disputes are white collar
and not homicidal/suicidal battles of NBC warfare, at least not yet here at home.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Mergers are complex operations, especially mergers of publicly traded companies of this size.  NAI and TIS will not fully close the merger deal for about 60 days.  Until then, there are many policy details we cannot discuss in public.
NAI has no plans to incorporate TIS's key recovery technology in any version of PGP, including our business versions.  I have discussed this
point with NAI management.
I have not changed my political values regarding privacy and crypto.
I would not have allowed the sale of my company to NAI if they were going to buy PGP in order to bury PGP, as some have feared.  They bought PGP because they value the reputation that PGP has earned in the industry.  They want to preserve that reputation by preserving PGP's product integrity.  I plan to keep watch over PGP's product integrity for the foreseeable future.
NAI plans to keep publishing our source code for peer review.  Source code publication in printed books is a vital part of NAI's business strategy, especially its overseas strategy.  There will be an important

   San Francisco, March 21 -- One of the nation's leading
   computer scientists has proposed a novel technique for
   scrambling data that could circumvent Government export
   policies aimed at limiting the foreign sale of encryption
   technology.
   The technique, which was described this week in an Internet
   discussion among computer researchers, was introduced by
   Ronald L. Rivest, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts
   Institute of Technology and one of the inventors of the
   most widely used commercial encryption scheme, RSA.
   The new approach, which is described in a short technical
   paper that has been posted to Mr. Rivest's M.I.T. Web site
   ( is
   described as "chaffing and winnowing" digital information
   instead of encrypting it.
   According to Mr. Rivest's paper, it is possible to hide a
   message by breaking it into packets that are then secretly
   identified as good information, or "wheat," and gibberish,
   or "chaff," in such a way that an eavesdropper cannot
   distinguish the two.
   Because the individual packets would not be encrypted, Mr.
   Rivest said, such a system would circumvent current export
   restrictions.
   The two principal ways of communicating in secret are
   encryption and steganography. Steganography uses computer
   techniques to embed a secret message in a document like a
   digital image. In encryption, secret information is encoded
   using functions that require difficult mathematical tasks
   to decode, and it has become the standard way of
   transmitting secret information electronically.
   There are no restrictions on the domestic use of this
   technology, but the Government has been trying to force the
   industry to adopt standards that would permit
   law-enforcement officials to have mathematical keys
   allowing them to decode messages without the knowledge of
   the sender or receiver. The Clinton Administration says the
   standards are needed to fight crime and terrorism.
   Opponents argue that the Government decoding keys, to be
   stored in computers, could easily be stolen, compromising
   privacy and the security of credit card numbers and other
   personal information.
   In terms of exports, with few exceptions the Government
   limits the software to codes that can be easily broken.
   "Winnowing does not employ encryption, and so does not have
   a 'decryption key,' " Mr. Rivest wrote in his paper. "As
   usual, the policy debate about regulating technology ends
   up being obsoleted by technological innovations."
   Peter Neumann, an SRI International computer scientist who
   has read Mr. Rivest's paper, said that although "there is
   still no certainty that this is a practical idea," if it
   works, "it throws another clinker at the Justice
   Department."
   Other cryptography experts said they were uncertain whether
   it would be possible to skirt Government export
   restrictions in this way, but that the idea was an
   impressive new approach that might have valuable commercial
   applications.
   "He's a very clever guy," said George Spix, a Microsoft
   researcher who specializes in cryptography policy issues.
   " It goes to show that for all the technological wizardry
   in the world, there's nothing like an intellect."
   One of the potential limitations of the new method is that
   the total information transmitted might need to be hundreds
   of times larger than the actual message.
   Mr. Rivest said, however, that he had discussed the idea
   with Adi Shamir, an Israeli cryptographer, and that Mr.
   Shamir had proposed compression methods that would reduce
   the total transmission to only about twice the actual
   message size.
   The strength of the idea for chaffing and winnowing is that
   it is possible to prove mathematically that a message
   cannot be decoded, Mr. Rivest said.
   He said he had come up with the idea recently while
   teaching an undergraduate computer course.
   In addition to his role as associate director of the
   Laboratory of Computer Science at M.I.T., Mr. Rivest is a
   consultant and shareholder in RSA Data Security Inc., a
   company that develops encryption software.
   "I put the winnowing and chaffing idea out there to
   stimulate debate,"' Mr. Rivest said. "I hope it will help
   clear up some of the issues that have been raised in the
   policy discussion.

@_subject: EMI and TWA 800 
The April 9 New York Review of Books has published a long special supplement, "The Fall of TWA 800: The Possibility
of Electromagnetic Interference," by Elaine Scarry, a noted author
and Harvard professor:
     (128K with 3 images)
The article closely examines the possibility of electromagnetic
interference in TWA 800's controls, comm, and black boxes
by activities of the ten US military planes and ships in the
vicinity which were heavily equipped for electronic warfare and were conducting tests of the gear. It is reports on what is publically known about the EM armaments
of planes and ships in the vicinity, about secret EM weapons and defenses, the several dozen military and commercial planes that have crashed due to EMI, military studies of long-standing EM hazards which will not be released to crash investigators, current research in EMI and what scientists in the field think about the possibility of EMI causing the fall of TWA 800.
It calls for the military to release its classified EMI research to
NTSB investigators, and short of that, for the servicemen and women on the planes and ships at the scene to tell what they know. It asks Congress to order military cooperation.
Not at all inflammatory or accusatory, it is thoroughly researched (over 100 notes and citations) and highly informative on the hazards of EMI, and worthy of ciritque by learned scientists in the field here.
Coda: Ron Brown's crash is not mentioned but its characteristics fit several other EMI accidents for which the military will not
release findings, claiming that national security EM weapons
secrets would be jeopardized.

New Judge to Decide Whether Export Restrictions on Software Violate
   Constitutional Guarantees of Freedom of Speech and of the Press
Reply Briefs in Junger v. Daley Available on World Wide Web
   ----------------------------------------------------------------

     _________________________________________________________________
Cleveland, Ohio, March 26 -- A status conference in the case of Junger v. Daley, the suit in which
a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio
seeks to enjoin the enforcement by the United States Department of
Commerce of the export regulations on encryption software, will be
held Friday, March 27, at 10:00 a.m. in the chambers of Federal
District Judge James S. Gwin in the federal courthouse in Akron,
Ohio.  The case turns on the issue of whether the publication in
electronic form of encryption software---software that is used to
preserve the privacy of electronic communications and data stored on a
computer---is entitled to protection under the First Amendment to the
United States Constitution.
Judge Gwin, a recent appointee to the federal bench who previously
served on the Ohio Court of Common Pleas, has replaced Judge Donald
C. Nugent as the judge responsible for the litigation. The plaintiff, Professor Peter Junger, who teaches a course in
Computing and the Law and who wishes to publish his class materials
containing some encryption programs on his World Wide Web server,
seeks an injunction against the enforcement by the defendant, Commerce
Secretary Daley, of the export regulations promulgated the Department
of Commerce that require anyone who wishes to publish encryption
software of the Internet or on the World Wide Web to first obtain a
license from the Bureau of Export Administration.
Both sides have filed for summary judgment.  Junger argues that the
freedoms of speech and of the press that are secured by the First
Amendment protect the writing and publication of computer programs.
The government, on the other hand, argues that computer programs are
not entitled to the protection of the First Amendment because they are
``functional''. Each side has filed a brief in support of its motion for summary
judgment.  These briefs and the complaint and motions for summary
judgment are available at  and
.  In addition both sides
have filed reply briefs that are now available at:
In his reply brief the plaintiff's lawyers argue:  ``Making software available on the Internet and the World Wide Web is publication of
that software, and publication in that medium is entitled to the
unqualified protection of the First Amendment.''
The government responds to this argument in its reply brief by
claiming that software is a ``functional item'' and thus not entitled
to protection as speech.  In furtherance of this claim it points out,
``Much software ... is designed to cause substantial harm,'' and that
``software can be used to invade privacy, commit fraud, and
substantially disrupt and endanger people's lives.''
``That is rather a perverse argument,'' says Junger, ``considering
that encryption software is used to protect against exactly the harms
that the government lists and that there is no law against the use of
encryption software, while, of course, there are laws against invading
privacy, committing fraud, and substantially disrupting and
endangering people's lives.  It is clear that the government does not
claim just the right to regulate the writing and publication of
encryption software.  It claims the right to forbid the writing and
publication of any type of computer program whatsoever without being
in any way restricted by the First Amendment.  There are, of course,
some types of speech, like obscenity, that the courts have held are
not entitled to the protection of the First Amendment, but no court
has ever subscribed to the government's remarkable theory that the
First Amendment does not protect functional speech.''
``My case,'' says Junger, ``is not just about the constitutionality of
the regulations forbidding the export of encryption software, though
that is an extremely important issue.  The real issue is whether the
First Amendment protects the writing and publication of any type of
computer program.''

In an April 30 Memorandum Opinion and Order Senior US District of New Mexico Judge Santiago Campos has ordered the National Security Agency to produce in camera evidence that it can refuse to respond to allegations of NSA intercepts of Libyan and Iranian encrypted messages in the 1980s.
     (102K)
This order was issued in repsonse to cryptographer Bill Payne's FOIA request for the information as part of his wrongful termination suit against NSA and Sandia National Laboratory. In the 56-page order Judge Campos reviews the principal actions in the suit, and to buttress the order for NSA to tell him what it knows about the intercepts invokes recent FOIA regulations which more stringently require intelligence agencies to substantiate the use of the "Glomar response" in refusing to affirm or deny the existence of information on the grounds that to do so would  harm national security.
He states that case law requires more diligent review in the case of "Glomarization," so he is obligated to make a review in
this instance. He states that based on what NSA has heretofore
provided the court, withholding of information on these intercepts does not appear justified.
Campos has reviewed public documents on allegations of the Swiss firm Crypto AG's "spiking" of its cryptographic equipment (with direction by NSA for backdoors) then selling it to Libya and Iran, Crypto AG's employee Hans Buehler's story of the work, Reagan's statement on the intercepts,
and other reports, and finds that while the stories are not
authoritative of the USG position, they do warrant his detailed review of NSA's Glomar response. Campos says, paraphrased, "if NSA continues to have the right it claims in this case to determine what is secret and what is not,
then it can declare anything secret and thereby undercut the very purpose of the FOIA. That is not acceptable."
It's an impressive summary of the legal conflict between the public's right to know and governmental secrecy. And may help ease access information on NSA global surveillance operations. Or, if Campos decides in NSA's favor, may shut the door more securely.

U. S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Export Administration
May 4, 1998  Advances in Computer Technology Make Export Controls More Difficult
Washington, D.C. -- Commerce Assistant Secretary Roger Majak and Dave Tarbell, director of the Defense Technology Security Administration at the Defense Department announced the release of a long-awaited study, "High-performance Computing, National Security Applications, and Export Control Policy at the Close of the 20th Century," by Dr. Seymour E. Goodman, Dr. Peter Wolcott and Dr. Patrick Homer. The study has been prepared as part of President Clinton's decision in 1993 to periodically assess U.S. computer export controls. Today's study provides an important contribution to the government's understanding of technology trends in the computer industry and national security uses for high performance computers.
The study finds that technology is evolving at an astounding rate in the HPC industry, rapidly increasing the performance of computers at all levels. Key findings include: 1) advancements in microprocessor performance which have brought down the costs of HPCs and reduced their size; 2) improvements in interconnect devices which have permitted a greater range of products to enter the market and helped to make high-performance power more accessible and affordable; 3) more open system architectures that contribute to enhanced calability; and 4) the ability to network the computing power of smaller systems to find solutions to large computational problems.
All of these advancements create challenges for export controls on HPCs. In particular, there is growing availability of ever more powerful computers in the world marketplace. The market for HPCs is flourishing worldwide with many new and used systems for sale through mail order and third party distribution systems. The study points out that determining what computing levels can be controlled depends on factors such as dependence on vendor support, the growing diversity of computer architectures and the scalability of computer An earlier study published by Dr. Goodman and his associates issued in 1995 predicted that computers with speeds of over 2,000 MTOPS would be widely vailable in commercial markets by 1997. Those predictions have proved
correct. This new study will be an important reference point for the Administration's continuing review of computer controls.

THE WHITE HOUSE
                    Office of the Press Secretary
For Immediate Release                                       May 12, 1998
                  INTERNATIONAL CRIME CONTROL STRATEGY
International crime is a serious and potent threat to the American
people at home and abroad.  Drug and firearms trafficking, terrorism,
money laundering, counterfeiting, illegal alien smuggling, trafficking
in women and children, advanced fee scams, credit card fraud, auto
theft, economic espionage, intellectual property theft, computer
hacking, and public corruption are all linked to international criminal
activity and all have a direct impact on the security and prosperity of
the American people.
Americans spend billions of dollars annually on cocaine and heroin, all
of which originates abroad; in 1997, there were 123 terrorist attacks
against U.S. targets worldwide, including 108 bombings and eight
kidnappings; each year, approximately one billion dollars worth of
stolen cars are smuggled out of this country; annually, U.S. companies
lose up to $23 billion from the illegal duplication and piracy of films,
compact discs, computer software, pharmaceutical and textile products,
while U.S. credit card companies suffer losses of hundreds of millions
of dollars from international fraud; and several hundred U.S. companies
and other organizations have already suffered computer attacks in 1998,
resulting in millions of dollars of losses and significant threats to
our safety and security.
The International Crime Control Strategy (ICCS) addresses this
increasing threat by providing a framework for integrating all facets of
the federal government response to international crime.  This first-ever
strategy reflects the high priority accorded international crime by this
Administration and builds on such existing strategies as the National
Drug Control Strategy and the Presidential Directives on alien
smuggling, counter-terrorism and nuclear materials safety and security.
The ICCS is also an important initiative in terms of enhancing the
ability of U.S. law enforcement officials to cooperate effectively with
their overseas counterparts in investigating and prosecuting
international crime cases.  At the upcoming Birmingham Summit, G-8
leaders will discuss international crime as one of the most pressing
issues related to increasing globalization and rapid technological and
economic change.  President Clinton will highlight the new ICCS in
underscoring the U.S. commitment to close cooperation with all nations
who are mobilizing to confront this increasing threat.
The ICCS is a plan of action containing eight broad goals with thirty
implementing objectives.  The ICCS expresses President Clinton's resolve
to combat international crime aggressively and substantially reduce its
impact on the daily lives of the American people.
The Strategy's eight goals and related objectives are:
1.   Extend the First Line of Defense Beyond U.S. Borders by      (a) preventing acts of international crime planned abroad before      they occur, (b) using all available laws to prosecute select      criminal acts committed abroad, and (c) intensifying activities      of law enforcement, diplomatic and consular personnel abroad.
2.   Protect U.S. Borders by (a) enhancing our land border inspection,
     detection and monitoring capabilities, (b) improving the      effectiveness of maritime and air smuggling interdiction efforts,      (c) seeking new, stiffer criminal penalties for smuggling      activities, and (d) targeting enforcement and prosecutorial      resources more effectively against smuggling crimes and      organizations.
3.   Deny Safe Haven to International Criminals by (a) negotiating new
     international agreements to create a seamless web for the prompt
     location, arrest and extradition of international fugitives,      (b) implementing strengthened immigration laws that prevent      international criminals from entering the United States and      provide for their prompt expulsion when appropriate, and      (c) promoting increased cooperation with foreign law enforcement      authorities.
4.   Counter International Financial Crime by (a) combating money
     laundering and strengthening enforcement efforts to reduce inbound      and outbound movement of criminal proceeds, (b) seizing the assets      of international criminals, (c) enhancing bilateral and      multilateral cooperation against all financial crime, and      (d) targeting offshore centers of international fraud,      counterfeiting, electronic access device schemes and other      financial crimes.
5.   Prevent Criminal Exploitation of International Trade by (a)
     interdicting illegal technology exports, (b) preventing unfair and
     predatory trade practices in violation of U.S. criminal law, (c)
     protecting intellectual property rights, (d) countering industrial
     theft and economic espionage of U.S. trade secrets, and (e)      enforcing import restrictions on certain harmful substances,      dangerous organisms and protected species.
6.   Respond to Emerging International Crime Threats by (a) disrupting      new activities of international organized crime groups,      (b) enhancing intelligence efforts against criminal enterprises,      (c) reducing trafficking in human beings and crimes against      children, (d) increasing enforcement efforts against high tech      and computer-related crime, and (e) continuing to identify and      counter the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructures and new      technologies in high tech areas.
7.   Foster International Cooperation and the Rule of Law by      (a) establishing international standards, goals and objectives to      combat international crime and by actively encouraging compliance,      (b) improving bilateral cooperation with foreign governments and      law enforcement authorities, and (c) strengthening the rule of law      as the foundation for democratic government and free markets in      order to reduce societies' vulnerability to criminal exploitation.
8.   Optimize the Full Range of U.S. Efforts by (a) enhancing executive
     branch policy and operational coordination mechanisms to assess      the risks of criminal threats and to integrate strategies, goals      and objectives to combat those threats, (b) mobilizing and      incorporating the private sector into U.S. government efforts, and      (c) developing measures of effectiveness to assess progress over      time.

@_subject: Senate Intel Committee on Crypto 
funding for FY1999, May 7, 1998:
    The Committee remains concerned about efforts to inappropriately ease or remove export restrictions on hardware and software encryption products. Export controls on encryption and other products serve a clearly defined purpose--to protect our nation's security. Therefore, the Committee believes that the effects on U.S. national security must be the paramount concern when considering any proposed change to encryption export policy, and will seek referral of any legislation regarding encryption export policy under its jurisdiction established under Senate Resolution 400.
    Export restrictions on encryption products assist the Intelligence Community in its signals intelligence mission. By collecting and analyzing signals intelligence, U.S. intelligence agencies seek to understand the policies, intentions, and plans of foreign state and nonstate actors. Signals intelligence plays an important role in the formation of American foreign and defense policy. It is also a significant factor in U.S. efforts to protect its citizens and soldiers against terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, narcotics trafficking, international crime and other threats to our nation's security.
    While the Committee recognizes the commercial interest in easing or removing export restrictions, it believes the safety of our citizens and soldiers should be the predominant concern when considering U.S. policy towards the export of any product. The Committee supports the continued control of encryption products, and believes that a comprehensive strategy on encryption export policy can and must be developed that addresses national security concerns as well as the promotion of American commercial interests abroad. The Committee looks forward to working with senior Administration officials in developing such a strategy.

Congressional Record: May 15, 1998 (Senate)
                    DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT
  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a section in the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act that I am particularly proud of, and
that is the law enforcement exception in the bill. At the Judiciary
Committee markup, Senator Grassley and I, along with the assistance of
Chairman Hatch and Senator Ashcroft worked to strengthen the law
enforcement exception in the bill. We received input on the language
from the copyright community and the administration: the National
Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the
Departments of Commerce and Justice, and the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB).
  The law enforcement exception ensures that the government continues
to have access to current and future technologies to assist in their
investigative, protective, or intelligence activities. I am concerned
that the tools and resources of our intelligence and law enforcement
communities are preserved--and more importantly, not limited, by
passage of S. 2037. Under that bill, a company who contracts with the
government can continue to develop encryption/decryption devices under
that contract, without having to worry about criminal penalties.
  Because much of our leading technologies come from the private
sector, the government needs to have access to this vital resource for
intelligence and law enforcement purposes.
  The law enforcement exception recognizes that oftentimes governmental
agencies work with non-governmental entities--companies, in order to
have access to and develop cutting edge technologies and devices. Such
conduct should not be prohibited or impeded by this copyright

Forwarded from Europe:
May 18, 1998
Telephone card fraud in the millions of dollars.
Hackers from the Netherlands have inundated the German market with illegally
recharged telephone cards, causing losses in the several millions of marks
(millions of dollars), stated the weekly Focus, due out Monday.
In breaking the telephone cards' code, the hackers succeeded in recharging
cards emptied of their credit.
The German association of tobacconist wholesalers assesses losses at 60
million marks (33 million dollars), reports Focus.
The con men bought used cards by the thousands from collectors. As a
result, their intitial price of five pfenning (2.7 cents) per card quickly
rose to one mark (55 cents).
According to experts cited by Focus, the recharged cards, which the
pirates resold at a lesser or equivalent price, are impossible to
distinguish from those purchased legitimately.
Card producers intend to stop this illegal commerce thanks to a new software
program allowing used cards to be electronically marked, the weekly believes.

Clinton Backs Cyber-Terror Warnings
Filed at 1:31 p.m. EDT
By The Associated Press
ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Nuclear warheads were the stuff of Cold War
stockpiles and beachheads the battlefields of times gone by. To counter
today's threats, President Clinton told a new class of Naval officers, the
United States must amass germ-warfare vaccines and battle terrorists in
cyberspace. ``If our children are to grow up safe and free, we must approach these new
21st century threats with the same rigor and determination we applied to the
toughest security challenges of this century,'' the president said today in
a commencement speech at the U.S. Naval Academy. For the 769 graduating midshipmen and 139 midshipwomen whose dress uniforms
shone blindingly white in the sun, Clinton painted a near-apocalyptic
picture of the enemies who threatened their mission beyond the academy. ``As we approach the 21st century, our foes have extended the fields of
battle from physical space to cyberspace, from the world's vast bodies of
water to the complex workings of our own human body. Rather than invading
our beaches or launching bombers, these adversaries may attempt cyber
attacks against our critical military systems and our economic base,''
Clinton said. Clinton also called for an interconnected ``cyber-system'' that would warn
and minimize damage of attacks on computers that control the stock market,
banking, utilities, air traffic and other so-called ``critical
infrastructure.'' Private companies including IBM, Dell Computers, Bell South and GTE have
already agreed to participate in the ``cyber-system,'' which Clinton wants
to be fully operational by 2003, administration officials said. ``If we fail to take strong action, then terrorists, criminals and hostile
regimes could invade and paralyze these vital systems, disrupting commerce,
threatening health, weakening our capacity to function in a crisis,''
Clinton said. He appointed National Security Council adviser Richard Clarke, who
specializes in such issues as drug trafficking and terrorism, to head a new
office on infrastructure protection and counter-terrorism. Former Sen. Sam
Nunn and Jamie Gorelick, formerly the Justice Department's No. 2 official
and now Fannie Mae's vice chairwoman, will lead a private industry advisory
group. [Warnings of bio-terrorism snipped]

Excerpt from statement on introduction of S.2107, "Electronic
Commerce Enhancement Act," May 21, 1998 :
 The most important benefit of this legislation, however, lies in the
area of electronic innovation. Currently, digital encryption is in a
relatively undeveloped state. One reason for that is the lack of
opportunity for many individuals and companies to make use of the
technology. Another is the lack of a set industry standard. By allowing
use of this technology in the filling out of government paperwork, and
by establishing a standard for digital encryption, the federal
government can open the gates to quick, efficient development of this
technology, as well as its more application throughout the economy. The
benefits to American businesses as they struggle to establish paper-
free workplaces that will lower administrative costs, will be
significant, and will further spur our national economy.

980734.  Special operations commander outlines future threats
by Capt. John Paradis
16th Special Operations Wing Public Affairs
HURLBURT FIELD, Fla. (AFNS) -- More Chechnyas.  If a military strategist
needed to look at a good model for the typical future conflict, the war
torn republic of Chechnya comes to mind, said Gen. Peter J. Schoomaker,
U.S. Special Operations Command commander in chief.
Speaking recently to about 2,000 Hurlburt Field troops at the 55th
Aircraft Maintenance Unit hangar, Schoomaker said the only certainty in
the future of warfare is that security challenges will be more ambiguous
and will follow less traditional paths.
Looking at Chechnya as an example of future conflict, confrontation will
likely differ from the more conventional and familiar "total war" by the
inclination of future adversaries to use "psychological terror" and the
influence of international media, the Internet and even cell phones to
employ open brutality as an information warfare tactic.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, determined to crush the secessionist
drive of the tiny, mainly Muslim southern republic, ordered about 40,000
troops into Chechnya in December 1994.  What was planned as a quick
campaign turned into a long and costly war, in which the outnumbered
rebels time and again dealt heavy blows to a demoralized Russian
It's such "asymmetric" opponents like separatists, rebel groups,
insurgents and terrorists that U.S. special operations forces will need
to prepare for -- enemies who won't attack U.S. strategic strengths, but
will instead target U.S. vulnerabilities by executing unorthodox
measures to gain success, Schoomaker said.
"That's the future.  More Chechnyas," the general said.   "We are going
to see more conflict of this nature because it's a much different world
we're facing."

The rationale of the FOIA to NSA for TEMPEST docs is that
due to increased public awareness of that technology,
the manufacturers of classified TEMPEST products and services are chomping at the bit to sell them to a broader
public market -- as with other dual-use technology like
We were asked to make the FOIA by those who've gotten
what they can from the many sources listed at Joel McNamara's
TEMPEST site -- which show that the market is growing but
is still hampered by classified restrictions:
   Yes, it's improbably that NSA will release all the docs requested
but perhaps some will be shaken loose, again as with other
once classified technology like crypto. In part because of
rising public awareness, in part because of manufacturers'
desire, in part because NSA will have developed more advanced technology.
Tim has heretofore advised on TEMPEST measures and the
latest are useful, and correspond to what's available in the
commercial market and what is available in mil/gov pubs --
many listed at Joel's site.
We are working on our desktop model with a manufacturer
who supplies RF-protected glass for government and industry
rooms as well as for entire buildings. We figure that if we can
make a workable model, we'll be able to use to demonstrate
to our clients why TEMPEST protection is needed and how it
can be accomplished in an elegant design manner, paralleling
demonstrations used by the glass manufacturer to substantiate
claims for his products.
One of the many things that keeps techies from getting the public's
money is being unable to convince the buyer that the invention
is truly desirable. Thus comes the marketer, who has skills of
invention of another sort to charm the skeptical consumer that
this baby has got to be a part of his/her life -- like fancy homes,
medical care, insurance cars, clothing, foods, weapons, bibles, and, above all, national security.
So a mongerer's brew is needed to peddle these inessentials,
composed of seriousness, humor, terror, lies and pretended
guilelessness, the practices of anyone doing well or doing badly, indeed, humans going about whatever they do to fill up the void.
BTW, the best technology is nearly always going to be classified, with sky high prices paid for by gullible citizens to calm their manufactured terrors (the religion model, once churches and temples
now weapons and satellites; once the priest/architect hustle, now
that of the the NatSec wonk/scientist), so the commercial market is only going to offer less than the best, the declassified waste products, while selling it as "The Best."
So we're seeking the crumbs from the NatSec table. And will use
what we get or don't get in our marketing campaign, having learned
the immortally favorite scheme: a mix of fact, fiction and fixation
on getting people to trust the seller, not the always waste promise.
But Tim knows that, practices that like a master, makes bundles.
And I always take him seriously, believe everything he says, and
admire his deadpan sense of humor more than anything else. Been
threatened by him, too, if I don't, all in accord with the NatSec madness
of our era.

Chase, Visa and Mastercard have closed down their

It also says Mondex has closed its Swindon trial.
The problem in NY is that the system was too cumbersome
to use, needing special readers that were not always up to
snuff, compared to the familiar and reliable system for credit cards. Bribing users with start up cash didn't work either.
No one ever reloaded their cards. Not all merchants took them,
especially those handling only cash transactions.
Also, the cards could not be used outside the trial area, and
the paper says, "everybody leaves the Upper West Side,"
without saying where they go to kill time for the day like
out of work Koreans who dare not admit the sublimity
of being jobless at long last -- money cannot buy the joy.
Spokespersons say that they misjudged the customer's desire
for cash-like freedom and anonymity (my words). That the best prospect for smartcard future lies in captive users such as college campuses and the military where they expect an all-purpose card will catch on by providing handy ID and money, as well as (unsaid) perfect monitoring and data-gathering.

@_subject: Spy News 
NYT reports today on a new book, "Blind Man's Bluff,"
which reports on the US's success at placing surveillance devices on Soviet subsea communications cables around the world. With much technical detail about how it was done, beginning with the simple but overlooked idea of locating shoreline warning signs about undersea cables then tracking from there.
The devices, some up to 20 feet long for housing elaborate processing equipment, captured electronic emanations, thereby eluding detection measures aimed at physical taps. One was found by the Soviets but  most were not and much information on the program is still classified.
AT&T and Bell labs built many of them. The US Navy will not comment on the book, citing national security restrictions.
The Times also has an obituary for Tommy Flowers, the gent who guided construction of Colossus machines at Bletchley Park to break top-level German codes during WW II.
There's still interesting debate about the Paul Dore story of
picking up signals from space, which he first thought were from
aliens, but which seems more likely to be from a surveillance
satellite, and possibly from a type not publicly known. Not enough
data yet to show that the story is not a hoax, or disinformation by
US/UK spy agencies, but it has led to informative discussion of what such signals could indicate. Notes on this at:
   More commentary welcome, here or privately.
Some will recall a vigorous discussion here a few years back
about listening in on US undersea cables, commencing at the
landfall points (dense packs of them here in the NYC area), many handily marked on coastal seafaring maps.

On his most recent speaking tour of Europe, at which he promoted PGP v 6, Phil Zimmermann assured us categorically that NAI had at
his insistence withdrawn from the KRA.
It now appears that either (1) he lied to us (2) he was himself
lied to by NAI management or (3) NAI has rejoined.
You marketed version 6 of your product on the back of a claim that
you'd left the KRA. Yet NAI is now listed on the KRA website as a
member, and this is clearly doing your product material harm. Either
it's not true that you're a member, in which case your lawyers will be
able to extract so much money from KRA that it goes out of business,
whereupon the world will cheer and buy your product, or it is true, in
which case the damage will continue.
There is a deeper issue for the community here. For many years we have
tended to trust products because we know the technical people
involved. This has been the foundation for trust of other kinds. For
example, some years ago, a certain country's foreign ministry asked me
for a reference on Entrust prior to buying their products; my response
was that I knew both Paul van Oorschot and Mike Wiener, and in my
opinion they were both very competent. As a result of this, purchasing
decisions may have been taken with a significant effect on national
intelligence, economic competitiveness and even military preparedness.
As the country in question is a NATO member, its diplomatic comsec (or
lack of it) affects the UK directly.
Now, in one weekend, we have two cases where assurances from credible
technical people turned out to be unsatisfactory. Where does that
leave us?
Since I gave that reference for Entrust, the University here has
tightened up on liability. We must take care not to give references
that are untruthful or even misleading. We are urged to err on the
side of caution. So next time a foreign ministry asks me whether
Entrust products are kosher, I probably have to reply:
`You cannot prudently trust any third party to sell you trustworthy
comsec products. Recall Britain's selling old Enigmas to allies in the
Commonwealth; think of the fuss over red-threading; check out the
trapdoor in Sesame; and read up on key escrow. The only way you can
get good kit is if you build it yourself.  If you don't have the

PhD programme - see '

I've commented about this on this list before I believe.  This appears
to be a case of really old news suddenly being dredged up for no
apparent wholesome reason -- which strikes me as quite odd because
Wired was apparently so eager to break this ancient story that they
didn't wait to ask anyone from NAI about it.
NAI being listed on the KRA page is *solely* a result of our TIS
acquisition.  I really doubt anyone here actually called some KRA
person and officially renewed our membership.  Frankly, I doubt anyone
here actually knows who to talk to there -- if there even is a
"there".  As I have said before, due to the TIS acquisition, NAI now
has a bunch of products which contain key escrow features. Eliminating or modifying these features such that they work in a less
big brother-like fashion will take significant time -- indeed entire
TIS products were based around managing key escrow infrastructures. Don't get me wrong, TIS had a lot of other great products, but it will
take time to redesign and rethink some of them in the context of
export and key escrow.  I'm not sure there's much point in withdrawing
from KRA when those products still exist.
These issues have no effect whatsoever on the PGP group.  As always,
we continue to publish full source code which effectively solves all
the export issues for us.

An NSA team presented at NISSC98 in October
"The Inevitability of Failure: The Flawed Assumption of Security in Modern Computing Environments:"
    (62K)
  Abstract
  Although public awareness of the need for security in   computing systems is growing rapidly, current efforts   to provide security are unlikely to succeed. Current   security efforts suffer from the flawed assumption   that adequate security can be provided in applications   with the existing security mechanisms of mainstream   operating systems. In reality, the need for secure   operating systems is growing in todayï¿½s computing   environment due to substantial increases in connectivity   and data sharing. The goal of this paper is to motivate   a renewed interest in secure operating systems so that   future security efforts may build on a solid foundation.   This paper identifies several secure operating system   features which are lacking in mainstream operating   systems, argues that these features are necessary to   adequately protect general application-space security   mechanisms, and provides concrete examples of how   current security solutions are critically dependent on   these features.
  Keywords: secure operating systems, mandatory security,   trusted path, Java, Kerberos, IPSEC, SSL, firewalls.
The paper advocates greater research on vulnerabilities
of operating systems which allow malicious attackers to
circumvent application-level security, including cryptographic protection. Ways to get around hardware
and software crypto are outlined.
Covert channels are a prime concern, as well as benign
use inadverdently allowing malicious intrusion.
An extensive list of references trace the twenty-five year history of OS flaws and examine why so little has been done to correct known deficiencies which undermine seemingly unbreachable applications.
Readings about DTOS, Fluke, Flash and other developments
of the NSA-sponsored Synergy program are illuminating.
The recent republication of early compsec documents by
CSRC is appropriate to this topic, particularly, "Subversion:
The Neglected Aspect of Computer Security," by Philip Myer,
June 1980, a thesis at NPS:

I saw CJ today at the Springfield facility for the
criminally disturbing. We spent five hours, a lot of
laughing, a little crying, and talking, with lots of
cameras and mikes on us. The controllers would not
let me take notes!
First, CJ's great hope and request to his friends is
to hang in there with him. He intends to go all the
way with this to trial, being his own defense lawyer,
even though he believes that since the Feds know they
will lose, they will try to get him to plea bargain
down to "walking his dog without a leash" as he puts
it. He is definitely on a mission.  He received
John's package, nothing from Declan. He has received
about half the mail I sent him. They are reading his
mail to his lawyers, supposedly forbidden.
CJ has been without glasses and without his teeth for
the whole time since he was arrested. JEFF GORDON
STILL HAS CJ'S TEETH. However, his vision has
improved! He is also without proper medication for
his Tourette's. The shrink told him that the
amphetamines he had been prescribed and which were
working well would probably be stolen by the staff
anyway. CJ is very conscious of managing his
neurological condition, with coffee, sugar, fasting,
and self-control. He does complain that he was so
pleased with himself that he got through his last
rage attack without hurting himself or acting it out
that he punched a wall in celebration and hurt his
hand! Even though he is supposed to be his own lawyer, he
has not even been informed about his indictment nor
has he been informed about anything else about his
At Springfield he has been in lockup for things that
he purportedly did at the Florence, Arizona prison.
The shrink gets a message this past weekend that
suddenly I am coming down, and this morning before I
get there he rushes in to tell CJ he's finally moving
him out of lockup into the open ward! Wolfson later
tells me that over two weeks ago he notified the
federal marshalls that CJ can be moved back to
Arizona, but he had not told CJ that.  I don't know
whether it's true.  He actually took me to task for
coming on such short notice.
CJ was very happy that the things he has sent out
have been posted, and it is clear that the support of
the cypherpunks community is important to him.
He did not talk to me about particular defense
strategies for obvious reasons.
He did indicate that the story that I relayed to John
about the incident in the federal courthouse in
Estevan involving a supposed gasoline "bomb"  (a
version of which incident was part of a story by
Declan) was a surprise to him;  he seemed both surprised and amused about what actions had been
attributed to him. To say I know and understand
nothing about this incident is an understatement. I
mention  it only because it is part of Jeff Gordon's
original complaint, a significant part I assume since
CJ has never been known to do physical injury to a
human being.
CJ has not seen the stories by Declan nor what has
been posted; I sent a hundred pages of stuff to Larry
Dowling his Austin lawyer, including copies of
Declan's articles. I had not sent these things to CJ
on the assumption that they would be censored. CJ
suggested that I ask Dowling to sent them with the
instruction on the envelope "open in the presence of
the inmate only". Again, he wants to see these things
because  his spirit is hanging on the support from
John and the rest of the community, although he said
very clearly that he is doing this on his own and
would do it alone if he had to.
Just before I left to come here, having finally been
cleared as a visitor, I got a call from Linda Lou
Reed, saying that she had not done a couple of things
needed to get his music CD together, since she has
been out of town. CJ and I talked about how to get
this together and I will work on it with other Tucson
friends. Someone had the idea of selling the CD's to
support a legal defense fund. I will report progress
as it occurs. And speaking of legal defense support, thanks to John
and others who made suggestions about legal support.
After many hours of discussion the family decided
that it was not the most intelligent thing to put up
the meagre family fortunes against the federal
government, and therefore we intend at this point to
trust CJ's defense to his stated (and historically
effective) plan to be his own defense, or to public
defenders. With some trepidation I brought this up to
CJ, and he was relieved; he said that he had been
worried that we would try to pay for a defense in
this case, which again he intends to push all the way
through no matter what compromises are offered to
him, and that our paying for his defense was not what
he wanted. Therefore I would like to put out to those who know
the situation to help CJ to obtain relevant legal
information and consultation as he goes into this, in
whatever form it is available.  If there are costs
that I personally can afford to support, I am happy
to. CJ has made repeated requests for access to legal
books at Springfield, and they disappear into
nowhere, no yes, no no. An interesting point:  CJ related that Dr. Wolfson
had asked him about his filing of IRS tax forms!  As
if they were on a fishing expedition looking for
other things to get CJ on, as they did with Jim Bell.
I confronted Wolfson about this, asking how it was
relevant to the issue Wolfson was supposed to be
investigating, which is CJ's competence to understand
the charges against him and to stand trial.  At that
exact moment he jumped up and said that he urgently
needed to answer a page which he had received five
minutes before. I overheard the conversation which he
had suddenly urgently to engage in, and it was a
trivial conversation about returning a copy of a
document to someone. But when he returned to me he
said "Well I have three reasons for having asked
that." Already suspicious, to have three reasons. The
main reason Wolfson said was that CJ says he has
attention deficient disorder (ADD) associated with
the Tourette's, and that asking if someone filed
taxes was a good indicator of their attention span!
(Could I be making this up?) I said, why not pick
something like, can you make it through the college
registration process? He replied, "I'm not used to
working with educated people."  Other "reasons" he
gave:  1) I want to give a thorough medical,
psychological, social and legal picture as part of my
judgment whether someone is capable of understanding
the charges against him, because if I leave
significant things out of my report I am more likely
to be receiving a subpoena to wherever CJ is being
tried, and that's inconvenient for me; and 2) there
are all these wacko people who question the authority
of government to levy taxes, put people to trial,
etc., and I need to determine whether he's one of
those and therefore suffering as part of a mass
delusion (his words)... he lost me there a little
bit. I didn't know whether that would be evidence of
sanity or insanity.
Anyway he seems to be sending off CJ into the next
stage with a report that CJ might have Tourette's, is
not schizophrenic, and in his experience is not
CJ does have some mighty interesting observations
about how things are done in this federal nuthouse
situation, which god willing we will all get to hear
someday. Meanwhile he has sent out certain
information to Declan on specific incidents in the
facility which he observed,  but is concerned that it
was not received.
Our expectation is that CJ will be returned to Tucson
and then extradited to Washington, but clearly as a
form of harrassment the marshalls are taking their
own sweet time about everything.
CJ's "case manager" at Springfeld is Bob Harris. The
phone number there is 417 862 7041, and CJ's prisoner
number is 05987-196. Any correspondence to anywhere
in the prison system needs to have that number on it.
John Bogart in Tucson  (520 624 8196) is the public
defender in CJ's local case, pending his extradition
to Washington state.  The family retained Larry
Dowling in Austin, a very old friend of CJ's and his
lawyer for a long time, for a small amount to look
after CJ's rights during incarceration; we have not
retained him to go the full way in this defense, for
the reasons stated above.  Supposedly John Bogart
will be informed when the marshalls actually choose
to move CJ (after the fact).  Therefore I suggest
that those who want to write to CJ write him soon and
by fast mail at U.S. Medical Center, POB Box 4000, Springfield, Missouri 65801.   Larry Dowling's
address is 606 West 11th, Austin, 78701. I assume he
might be willing  to forward it to CJ on the
assumption that CJ will in fact be moved. Larry has
been a true friend throughout this and past
CJ has said that since he has been incarcerated for
three months now with no indication to him as to
formal charges, it is time to act to get him out of
Springfield. I concur, and unless I hear within a
week that he is being moved, I will take some of the
cypherpunk friends up on their offer to begin to
address this case through the local ACLU.  CJ's
greatest fear is that he will do something that will
justify involuntary drug administration, and he will
be defeated in that way. He is also afraid that he
will simply be killed in prison.
However, all in all I found CJ in pretty good
spirits, and clearly feeling "on purpose" vis a vis
his goals with his cypherpunk activities. I related
to him during our talk that one of my sons just took
some time off from university so that he would have
time to actually read, and that he had accurately
predicted to his friends exactly how I would respond
to the news: "Honey, I'm so proud!" CJ said that's
how I seemed to feel now about his arrest.  It is,
finally. I trust that CJ, in spite of a pattern of
sometimes shooting himself in the foot, is
brilliantly inspired by important libertarian values
and goals. I appreciate the education and inspiration
I have gained from getting to know this side of his
life and some of the people, technologies, issues and
ideas of which previously I had only vague notions.

John and the rest of the community, although he said
very clearly that he is doing this on his own and
would do it alone if he had to.
Just before I left to come here, having finally been
cleared as a visitor, I got a call from Linda Lou
Reed, saying that she had not done a couple of things
needed to get his music CD together, since she has
been out of town. CJ and I talked about how to get
this together and I will work on it with other Tucson
friends. Someone had the idea of selling the CD's to
support a legal defense fund. I will report progress
as it occurs. And speaking of legal defense support, thanks to John
and others who made suggestions about legal support.
After many hours of discussion the family decided
that it was not the most intelligent thing to put up
the meagre family fortunes against the federal
government, and therefore we intend at this point to
trust CJ's defense to his stated (and historically
effective) plan to be his own defense, or to public
defenders. With some trepidation I brought this up to
CJ, and he was relieved; he said that he had been
worried that we would try to pay for a defense in
this case, which again he intends to push all the way
through no matter what compromises are offered to
him, and that our paying for his defense was not what
he wanted. Therefore I would like to put out to those who know
the situation to help CJ to obtain relevant legal
information and consultation as he goes into this, in
whatever form it is available.  If there are costs
that I personally can afford to support, I am happy
to. CJ has made repeated requests for access to legal
books at Springfield, and they disappear into
nowhere, no yes, no no. An interesting point:  CJ related that Dr. Wolfson
had asked him about his filing of IRS tax forms!  As
if they were on a fishing expedition looking for
other things to get CJ on, as they did with Jim Bell.
I confronted Wolfson about this, asking how it was
relevant to the issue Wolfson was supposed to be
investigating, which is CJ's competence to understand
the charges against him and to stand trial.  At that
exact moment he jumped up and said that he urgently
needed to answer a page which he had received five
minutes before. I overheard the conversation which he
had suddenly urgently to engage in, and it was a
trivial conversation about returning a copy of a
document to someone. But when he returned to me he
said "Well I have three reasons for having asked
that." Already suspicious, to have three reasons. The
main reason Wolfson said was that CJ says he has
attention deficient disorder (ADD) associated with
the Tourette's, and that asking if someone filed
taxes was a good indicator of their attention span!
(Could I be making this up?) I said, why not pick
something like, can you make it through the college
registration process? He replied, "I'm not used to
working with educated people."  Other "reasons" he
gave:  1) I want to give a thorough medical,
psychological, social and legal picture as part of my
judgment whether someone is capable of understanding
the charges against him, because if I leave
significant things out of my report I am more likely
to be receiving a subpoena to wherever CJ is being
tried, and that's inconvenient for me; and 2) there
are all these wacko people who question the authority
of government to levy taxes, put people to trial,
etc., and I need to determine whether he's one of
those and therefore suffering as part of a mass
delusion (his words)... he lost me there a little
bit. I didn't know whether that would be evidence of
sanity or insanity.
Anyway he seems to be sending off CJ into the next
stage with a report that CJ might have Tourette's, is
not schizophrenic, and in his experience is not
CJ does have some mighty interesting observations
about how things are done in this federal nuthouse
situation, which god willing we will all get to hear
someday. Meanwhile he has sent out certain
information to Declan on specific incidents in the
facility which he observed,  but is concerned that it
was not received.
Our expectation is that CJ will be returned to Tucson
and then extradited to Washington, but clearly as a
form of harrassment the marshalls are taking their
own sweet time about everything.
CJ's "case manager" at Springfeld is Bob Harris. The
phone number there is 417 862 7041, and CJ's prisoner
number is 05987-196. Any correspondence to anywhere
in the prison system needs to have that number on it.
John Bogart in Tucson  (520 624 8196) is the public
defender in CJ's local case, pending his extradition
to Washington state.  The family retained Larry
Dowling in Austin, a very old friend of CJ's and his
lawyer for a long time, for a small amount to look
after CJ's rights during incarceration; we have not
retained him to go the full way in this defense, for
the reasons stated above.  Supposedly John Bogart
will be informed when the marshalls actually choose
to move CJ (after the fact).  Therefore I suggest
that those who want to write to CJ write him soon and
by fast mail at U.S. Medical Center, POB Box 4000, Springfield, Missouri 65801.   Larry Dowling's
address is 606 West 11th, Austin, 78701. I assume he
might be willing  to forward it to CJ on the
assumption that CJ will in fact be moved. Larry has
been a true friend throughout this and past
CJ has said that since he has been incarcerated for
three months now with no indication to him as to
formal charges, it is time to act to get him out of
Springfield. I concur, and unless I hear within a
week that he is being moved, I will take some of the
cypherpunk friends up on their offer to begin to
address this case through the local ACLU.  CJ's
greatest fear is that he will do something that will
justify involuntary drug administration, and he will
be defeated in that way. He is also afraid that he
will simply be killed in prison.
However, all in all I found CJ in pretty good
spirits, and clearly feeling "on purpose" vis a vis
his goals with his cypherpunk activities. I related
to him during our talk that one of my sons just took
some time off from university so that he would have
time to actually read, and that he had accurately
predicted to his friends exactly how I would respond
to the news: "Honey, I'm so proud!" CJ said that's
how I seemed to feel now about his arrest.  It is,
finally. I trust that CJ, in spite of a pattern of
sometimes shooting himself in the foot, is
brilliantly inspired by important libertarian values
and goals. I appreciate the education and inspiration
I have gained from getting to know this side of his
life and some of the people, technologies, issues and
ideas of which previously I had only vague notions.

@_subject: National Security KRA Framework 
These are excerpts from US Patent 5835596: "International
cryptography framework" issued on November 10, 1998, to
inventors Keith S. Klemba, Santa Clara, CA, and Roger
Merckling, Gieres, France and assigned to Hewlett Packard. Source: It's an update of US Patent 5651068 issued for the same
methodology in July, 1997. Summaries of the patents are
also available at <  >.
INTERNATIONAL CRYPTOGRAPHY FRAMEWORK
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The invention provides a four-part technology framework
that supports international cryptography, which includes a
national flag card, a cryptographic unit, a host system, and a
network security server. Three of the four service elements
have a fundamentally hierarchical relationship. The National
Flag Card (NFC) is installed in the Cryptographic Unit (CU)
which, in turn, is installed into a Host System (HS).
Cryptographic instructions on the Host system cannot be
executed without a Cryptographic Unit, which itself requires
the present of a valid National Flag Card before its services
are available. The fourth service element, a Network
Security Server (NSS), can provide a range of different
security services including verification of the other three
service elements.
The framework supports the design, implementation, and
operational elements of any and all national policies, while
unifying the design, development, and operation of
independent national security policies. The invention thus
gives standard form to the service elements of national
security policies, where such service elements include such
things as hardware from factors, communication protocols,
and on-line and off-line data definitions. [Snip drawing and
detailed descriptions.]
APPLICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK
The invention has various applications. In particular, the
framework is ideally suited for various national security
schemes and operates consistently across a variety of local
laws. For example the framework could be used to support a
key escrow policy. Key escrowing is a process where the
keys or family keys used for cryptography are kept by a third
party, in the national context, typically a government agency.
This allows the third party to decrypt information when, for
example, a law enforcement agency is required to see the
contents of an encrypted message.
For example if the policy of nation-X requires key escrow,
then when nation-X NFC's are put into circulation they
contain a key escrowed by nation-X. Law enforcement
would be able to use the electronic stamp on a message to
determine that the message was encrypted under the policy
of nation-X. It would also be able to determine unique
identification information of the specific NFC used to enable
the CU. If nation-X agrees to cooperate, the escrowed key
for the NFC involved may be obtained to decrypt the
suspicious message.
The actual encryption algorithm used in nation-X may be the
same encryption algorithm that is used in nation-Z, such that
when a user from nation-X visits nation-Z it is only
necessary to put a NFC from nation-Z into the CU. The
encryption algorithm in the CU remains the same, but what
is governing the use of cryptography is the policy of nation-
Z. For example, the policy of nation-Z may require a trap
door, such that the government of nation-Z is able to take a
back door into the users system to read the deciphered text.
In this case the nation-Z NFC provides a back door rather
than an escrowed key to law enforcement. Several such
schemes are known in the art and it is a feature of the
invention that the framework is readily adapted to
accommodate such schemes as may be implemented in a
particular national policy without affecting the basic
hardware, or data structures of a user system, with the
exception of the NFC.
Thus, the encryption algorithms in CU may be the same
encryption algorithms used everywhere. The NFCs control
the use of these encryption algorithms in accordance with
the local law. Because the NSS is a trusted third party that
validates proper local use of the framework, it is not
possible to use cryptography unless a locally accepted NFC
is installed in the CU. In the example above, even though the
encryption engine operates properly in nation-X, it would
not operate in nation-Z unless the NFC was replaced with a nation-Z's NFC. For international communication of
encrypted information, (e.g. where an encrypted message is
generated in nation-Z and sent to nation-X) the involvement
of cryptography for such messages will be independently
controlled by two NFCs -- the X flag card in nation-X and
the Z-flag card in nation-Z. The invention therefore offers
the ability to support government policy, whatever that
policy may be, and still provide uniform cryptographic
In addition to the nationalization issues that are illustrated
above, within a certain nation there may be multiple
encryption policies (e.g. nation-X might have a policy for
banking that is more liberal than its policy for
manufacturing). Accordingly, the framework is adapted to
operate within each country under several different national
policies, or with several different levels of encryption. For
example, just as there are different stamps for first class and
priority mail, the framework may allow for different levels
of encryption based on the type of NFC installed.
It is a feature of the framework that CUs may have the major
standard encryption algorithms built-in (e.g. DES, RSA,
DSS, MD5). However, it is also possible to install custom
algorithms into the CU providing that the policy in the
governing NFC permits this type of activity. Software
algorithms can be transferred completely or partially into the
CU from either the NFC or the NSS. Hardware algorithms
can be added to the CU via the NFC. The actual encryption
of a message may involve the NFC, CU, or NSS, or any
combination thereof. As soon as the NFC is removed from
the CU these custom algorithms are no longer operative,
perhaps not even present, in the CU.

They propose three new orgs to prevent and respond to terrorist
use of WMD on a large scale:
1. National Terrorism Intelligence Center (Mil/Intel/LEA)
2. National Information Assurance Institute (Gov/Corp/Tank)
3. Catastrophic Terrorism Response Offices (Intel/Plan/Train/Task/Direct)
Paralleling Senator Kyl and others, the proposals are based
on the increased domestic use of the military while proclaiming
civil liberties will be protected. And though there is considerable
detail about how the military, intelligence agencies and
law enforcement will work together - US and foreign - and the
vast purchases of sevices and equipment that will be needed, there's next to nothing about how civil liberties will be protected.
Reference is made to America's marshalling its patriotism and technology to win the Cold War, and the wondrous inventions
developed to do that. Again, though, no mention is made of the
price of military industrialism, which is to be expected of our
finest catastrophe-obessessed minds unable to imagine a world without endless national security threats to grow their pork.

@_subject: KRA on NAI/KRA 
Phil and Cabe,
For your info. Response will be very welcome.
Hash: SHA1
I have some questions about the KRA.
1. In your FAQ , you state that one of the
organization's goals is to:
  "Serve as a focal point for industry efforts to develop commercially
   acceptable solutions for recovery of encrypted information"
This seems to allow that there may be valid encrypted _data_ recovery
methods other than _key_ recovery using the KRA's "common key recovery
block" (still under discussion). However, I'm not aware of the KRA's public
position on the recovery of plaintext using cryptographically sound and
ethically responsible alternatives to the escrowing of keys in
organizational situations, e.g. PGP's Additional Decryption Key (ADK)
mechanism. What is the KRA's public position on PGP's ADK?
2. A public debate has recently arisen because the KRA website's member
roster indicates that Network Associates (NAI) is a member of the KRA. NAI
representatives, however, have publicly contraindicated this. Can you
clarify NAI's membership status in the KRA, specifically:
A. On what date (if ever) did NAI apply for membership in the KRA?
B. Is the KRA in possession of any evidence (letter, etc) to show that NAI
    was or is a member of the KRA?
C. If NAI was a member of the KRA at any time, on what date did a
    corporate officer of NAI formally withdraw NAI from the KRA, if ever?
D. Regarding KRA membership policy, if a company is not a member itself
    but acquires another company that is a KRA member, but, does
    this acquisition automatically confer membership status on the parent
    company, or is a formal request to "expand" the company's membership
    necessary?
E. If NAI was not a member of the KRA at the time of its Trusted
    Information Systems (TIS) acquisition, did the KRA receive a request
    from any NAI representative to expand TIS's membership to all of NAI?
3. KRA member companies are listed with their web URLs, but no individual
contact name/phone/email is provided for any of them. Can you supply a
complete listing of the designated contacts (corporate representatives) at
each of the KRA member organizations, should one want to discuss with them
their respective companies' KR positions or proposals? For example, if, in
fact, the KRA website is correct to list NAI as a member, then who is NAI's
official KRA representative?
Thank you in advance for your prompt clarification.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
Mr. Del Torto,
Thank you for your inquiry about a KRA member company. I am member of the
Alliance's secretariat staff addressing their business and administrative
needs. This puts me in a position to answer some of your questions directly.
Others I will pass along to appropriate Alliance member representatives for
About the KRA's public position on PGP's ADK, obviously it was not
adequately addressed for your needs in the Alliance's existing materials. I
will ask a more appropriate and knowledgeable spokesperson to respond to
your questions and concerns.
Concerning Network Associates membership in the KRA, in response to your
question I have verified that our files contain an executed Membership
Agreement for Network Associates (dated July 2, 1998), as well as a properly
completed Application for Membership of that same date. As an aside, the KRA has retained our firm to manage their business and
administrative affairs. Our business is solely the management of industry
associations. Thus, we have no conflict of interest as our clients are the
'associations' themselves and not any of the individual member companies.
For the management of our client associations (currently 4) we employ
certain practice standards. One important practice area is the impartial
recognition of membership. Simply put, we exercise no discretionary judgment
about whether a company is a member or not. If a company completes the
required steps to become a member (execute an agreement, complete an
application and pay the appropriate dues) they become a member. In other
words, membership is binary...complete all the steps --> become a member;
omit any of these steps --> NOT a member.
Ever since the the Alliance was formally constituted as a California
nonprofit corporation (October 1997), rigorous application processes have
been in place. It is true that a number of companies, including NAI I
believe, were attending meetings under the name of the KRA during much of
1997. However, until the Alliance was formally constituted, involving
membership agreements, applications and payment of dues, it's not entirely
accurate to characterize those companies participating in 1997 as 'members'
of the Alliance. Indeed, some of this current 'public debate' about NAI's
relationship with the KRA goes back to their public statement that they
'withdrew' from the organization. The fact of the matter is that they simply
did not choose to become an actual member at the time the organization was
formally constituted. When it was reported that they withdrew, there was in
fact no entity from which to withdraw. Regarding the listing of individual representatives from member companies,
it is the Alliance's policy not to do this. For whatever it's worth, this is
a standard practice of industry associations. I am passing your message
along to the designated NAI representative and inviting him to respond. At the risk of stating the obvious, it is not uncommon for companies in any
industry, especially hi-tech, to have multiple opinions within their
management teams. And, to have these opinions expressed in public forums. It
has been my experience that it is dangerous to infer corporate and product
strategies from a companies membership in industry groups. Companies join
industry associations for all manner of reasons, not all of which they share
with the market. I'm not suggesting any thing other than the fact that our
industry makes for extremely "complex business" and there's no reason to
believe that this complexity of actions, strategies and motivations isn't
going to appear in a company's involvement in industry associations. Sorry for the length of this reply. However, it's clear that there are a
great many concerns behind your questions and I've tried to reach those
concerns. I hope this response has been useful to you. Michael LoBue

DoD rolled out today the new Defense Threat Reduction
Agency which combines several agencies -- Defense
Special Weapons Agency, Defense Technology Security Administration, On-Site Inspection Agency and others --
into a new organization whose principle purpose will be
to control the spread of technologies of mass destruction.
See remarks made at the opening ceremony by Hamre and others:
   And the new, informative DTRA Web site:
   The briefing remarks are of interest for what they disclose
about military planning for combating domestic terrorism (parallel to what the FBI said about it yesterday), promises to speed export licensing and a passing reference by Hamre to "a recent ten month process of encryption policy review."
Which may refer to the recent administration policy announcement or maybe another in the works.
With the build-up of domestic terrorism fighting forces --
all the mil and gov agencies -- and noises about legislation
being developed for more, it's worth pondering what is
coming with a crackdown on domestic use of encryption.
The Canadian duplicitous announcement today may offer
a clue to what's being secretly agreed upon internationallly: state there will be no domestic controls (to assure privacy
and secure commerce) coupled with promises to ease export limits (to assure commercial producers), then contradict that
with a statement about new legislation to criminalize
encryption use in the name of "public safety" and provision
for access to encrypted data (to assure national security and law enforcement).
Tell all parties what they want to hear in public, then arrange
for what's really going to happen in secrecy among those
responsible parties who know how to bear the terrible burden
of keeping society safe and sound.
Which brings up Time's new "Digital Daily" replacement for
Netley News. News seems to have been eliminated in
favor of entertaining fluff and product promo, even worse
than "mainstream" Time itself. What's up Declan? Has the ghost of Luce come back to order Time online to shut up reporting unpleasant nefaria and get on with narcotizing the masses via Luce's incomparable coy language of

use of the phrase "in the special maritime and territorial

Title 18, United States Code, Section 7(3), and outside the jurisdiction of any particular state or jurisdiction," to apparently lay claim to the legal right of the US to arrest and imprison terrorist suspects for acts in any location where US law customarily would not be valid:
   Would any of our legal advisors know the origin of that phrase "outside the jurisdiction of any particular state or jurisdiction?" Is this new, and devised to reduce conflict
with other states who may harbor terrorists, or perhaps
prevent them from being terrorist targets for cooperating

   House Passes Roving Wiretaps, Expands Federal Surveillance Powers
In a closed-door manuever, controversial "roving wiretap" provisions were
added to a major Intelligence authorization bill and passed by the House
this afternoon. Current wiretapping law allows tapping of a particular
person's phones. The new provisions would dramatically expand current
authority by allowing taps on any phone used by, or "proximate" to, the
person being tapped -- no matter whose phone it is. Such a broad law
invites abuse.
In the last Congress, the full House of Representatives rejected these
provisions after an open and vigorous debate. This week, behind closed
doors, a conference committee added the provisions to the important
Intelligence Authorization Conference Report, almost certain to pass the
Congress. The provisions were not in either the original House or Senate
versions of the bill.  CDT is particularly concerned that such an expansion
of federal authority should take place without a public debate.

Tom Allard,
Thanks much for forwarding Jeff Gordon's message.
I called Jeff at the number provided -- he answered --  I named
myself, described the message and asked if it was genuine, that spoofs had appeared on the list recently. He said, you mean it appeared on the cypherpunks list. I said yes it did and it'd be a help to know which messages are believable, that it's a bitch these days trying to figure out who's who and who's writing what. I said the msg'd be in  the archives shortly if he wanted to check it out, and offered  to forward a copy in the meantime. He said sure I'll take a look at it and let you know.
So I lobbed it up to WA, without the headers. See the
exchange below.
BTW, did anybody else get one of these? If so, send along,
in the clear or anon.

@_subject: What it's like to get a subpoena (re Toto) (fwd) 
Jim Choate's sharing his experiences with the IRS is
very welcome, as with Tom Allard forwarding the Jeff
Gordon request for assistance.
Other inquiries of folks on the list will probably happen,
and information about those would be beneficial. It would be
a great help to post here any other overtures, anonymous
if preferred.
It's tough being the earliest ones contacted, having to decide
as Tom and Jim have had to do about whether to go public
or deal with the inquiries in private and hope that nothing worse
It's likely that more serious targets will be approached later,
using material obtained from those not at risk, those with
no reason to fear the friendly, courteous IRS.
At least that's what happened with Jim Bell and CJ. They, too,
said they were handled in a friendly courteous manner until ... the case was presented to a magistrate.
According to CJ's sister even the shrink at Springfield is
the friendliest most courteous person she's talked to, helpful, considerate, and said he had CJ's interest at heart. She said she just hoped he didn't cut off CJ's medicine, cause him to go berzerk, then to disappear.
It's that switch from friendly and couterous to the other that
none of want to think about, eh? "You're under arrest. Anything
you say can and will be used against you." Hmm, what was I
saying, posting, here.
BTW, the offshore archives, if they are offshore, are a problem
for getting legal access to, and to use in court. I think a human linkage is preferred, in deposition, in court, testifying for the record.
Makes a more convincing case to have a live body telling the
facts of the matter, explaining how things work, somewhat eager to instruct and please, in self-preservation, to keep the cops and
court friendly and courteous. What was told to the investigators in private, that's what hung Jim Bell and CJ.
But, hey, they were nuts, right? Fuck them. Then the friendly folks came for you and me, working a list.

@_subject: FBI Affidavit on Ex-NSA Cryptanalyst 
We offer the FBI's 23-page affidavit of charges against David
Sheldon Boone, ex-NSA cryptanalyst who allegedly
passed top secret SIGINT, EW and nuclear targeting plans to the Soviets:
   Tantalizing hints on means and methods, quoting the affidavit of the FBI agent in charge:
  On one occasion, "Igor" [Soviet agent] told BOONE that the   KGB/SVRR had access to United States Signals Directive   (USSID) Zero, which was an index of all other USSIDs, and   from this index IGOR asked BOONE to obtain specific USSIDs.   I have ascertained that USSIDs are classified NSA publications   for use in providing Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) support to   the United States military.
  BOONE told the OA [FBI Operational Asset posing as Soviet   agent to set up Boone] that he had given "Igor" a photocopy   of an NSA document entitled "United States Signals Intelligence   Directive (USSID) 514," dated May 6, 1988.  BOONE told the   OA that this USSID was unusual because it was one of few   USSIDs to be classified TOP SECRET rather than SECRET.   BOONE told the OA that USSID 514 was not widely   disseminated but that one copy had been at USAFS   Augsburg. And more on Boone's training and duties in cryptanalysis at
Fort Meade and in Germany.

  For Violation of 18:115(a)(1)(B): Threatening to assassin

The other humor is that upon indictment for criminal charges
on September 30 a bench warrant was issued for CJ's arrest.
The arrest warrant was "returned unexecuted" on October 9,
due to "warrant issued in error" by the same magistrate who
issued the first arrest warrant on August 5, apparently forgetting
or not knowing that CypherAssassin2 was mental evaluing with CypherAssassin1 in MO. See the docket:

@_subject: 2nd Report on Political Control Technologies 
I'm a Dutch journalist, working for NRC Handelsblad, one of the major
newspapers in the Netherlands. I've been reporting about the STOA report An Appraisal of Technologies of Political Control since last A second report came out last month. I got a copy a few days ago from the Omega Foundation and had an article about it in NRC Handelsblad today. This second report has interesting information about the so called EU-FBI global surveillance plan. According to a secret memorandum the EU countries have agreed with the FBI to intercept all European datacommunication. To do this some EU countries like Holland and Germany changed their laws to make broad wiretapping and interception of Internet and other datacommunication possible. Germany changed its constitution in the beginning of this year and in Holland a law was made and accepted by both chambers of the
Parliament that obliges all firms with computer and communication networks (providers, telco's, newspapers etc.) to make their systems tappable. You can read the second report at:

Marie-Jose Klaver
NRC Handelsblad
 There's much new information in the report, especially on
the US export of political control technologies which complements Amnesty International's recent critique of US violations of human rights, as well as the US Bureau of Prisons reorganization, all to accommodate the rise in
domestic and foreign freedom fighters, oops, terrorists,
as global Justice and Defense agencies characterize naysayers to bloated organs of dysfunctional cracies.

What with the Feds now going after CJ for attempted
murder of federal officials (film ad overkill!), Jeff Gordon soliciting cypherpunk subscribers to flesh that fancy, and one CDR operator flattered with a subpoena, it'd be prudent to have a way to check on whether a CDR node has been taken down or turned, and the operator hogtied with the system as evidence (or forced to run a sting to gather it), before a clamp's put on telling what's going on.
May be too late, too late.
Recall it's a major offense for revealing placement of a wiretap, surveillance or a covert investigation -- especially if you're assisting, willingly or unwillingly.
Not that one should advocate hiding what might be construed
as evidence or exposing underbelly work that's ordered concealed. Why that might be taken to be pushing a conspiracy against WMD-crazed authority rather than promoting personal hygiene with lots of sunshine and vigorous exercise of rights to fanciful
imaginings of what a world would be like without minders galore.
Whistling in the dark, mind you.

@_subject: CJustice 
We got documents on CJ from the US District Court,Western WA, in Tacoma. Pretty skimpy but informative on why CJ has been held for two months since his arrest on August 18.
As noted earlier, CJ has been indicted, clubbed with a blunt                           COUNT 1
  Beginning on or about June 23, 1997, and continuing through
  December 9, 1997, at Tacoma and elsewhere, within the Western
  District of Washington, CARL EDWARD JOHNSON, did threaten
  to kill certain federal law enforcement officers and judges
  of the United States, with intent to impeded, intimidate, or
  interfere with said officers and judges on account of their
  official duties.
  All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections
  115(a)(1)(B).
  Dated September 30 1998.
The June 23 and December dates bracket the messages cited in
the complaint by Jeff Gordon, and discussed here. The grand
jury must have base its charge on Jeff's complaint for there's
no explication of the charges in the indictment. (See the complaint
at: On the date of the indictment a bench warrant was issued for CJ's arrest. It was returned on October 9 marked "returned unexcuted - warrant issued in error - per AUSA Robb London." CJ was in Springfield during this time.
There were two handwritten notes. One says: "Called Tucson - Have Mag case on 98-2824M. Undergoing psych eval. 8/26/98. 520-620-7200.
The other: "10/5/98. Per Tucson, Deft in Psych Eval. Unsure of
dates in order to figure Speedy Trail."
A Case Status form, dated September 22, 1998, notes that CJ is
in detention based on a District of Arizona order, with the
note, "8-18-98; now awaiting compentency evaluation and R40
hearing." At the bottom the form states "The estimated trial time is 4 trial days."
What's screwy about all this is that when the grand jury returned the indictment and a bench warrant was issued, CJ was in Springfield but the AUSA seemed not to know it, or didn't tell the magistrate who issued the bench warrant, although the notes in the case file clearly showed that this information had been recorded. Who knows what else the grand jury and judge was
told or not told by the US Attorneys and the IRS -- the public record tells naught.
And CJ's right to a speedy trial, though noted, is overridden by the prolonged psychological evaluation process, as well as
overlooked or ignored communications between WA and AZ.
And the buffoonish bench warrant? That appears to indicate incompetence in the US Attorney's office -- that's AUSA
Robb London in charge (not to slight Katrina Pflaumer, USA, and William Redkey, AUSA, who also signed the indictment).
And the four days for a trial for alleged murder attempts? Is this real? Or is this threat of quick vicious justice by biased attorneys with vengence in mind, coupled with the prolonged delay, a ploy to coerce CJ to plead?
Brings back memories of Jim Bell's punishment by delay, isolation, manipulation, change of jails, and coercion, with a plea bargain just to get the the psychological torture to Wonder if Jim and CJ are allowed to swap tips and tricks on surviving political imprisonment in the United States of America. Creative writing of text and music, lyrics for the
song of assassination politics by American Justice.

An engineer at a US wireless telecom and a contributor to Cryptologia--has asked me to look into the present status of attacks on the GSM encryption schemes:  comp128 (a3a8 authentication, etc.) and, more importantly, the A5.1 and A5.2  voice/data encryption algorithms.
After searching the web, I see that you have similar interests in this matter.  I've already sent off inquiries to some of the researchers in this area--Ross Anderson, Simon Shepherd and the two Berkeley students (Goldberg and Wagner).  So far, I've only heard back from Wagner.  Do you have anything interesting to say about this matter--has anything happened since the Spring?  Has a consensus been reached on some of the issues discussed in the  document?
I'm trying to get a handle on the present state-of-the art:  Where do things presently stand--who is doing the work and what, if anything, has been verified/demonstrated?   Has A5 been cracked?   What can be said about the possibility of intercepting and decoding an on-air conversation?

JG Note:
  Preliminary advice from an attorney is that it is likely the
  Electronic Communications Privacy Act covers this request for stored
  electronic communications, therefore requiring a real warrant (not a
  subpoena), reimbursement for the expenses of complying, etc.
  Others (if any) who have received similar subpoenas should
  consult with their attorneys, and are encouraged to publish
  (to the list and the JYA.COM web site) anything they receive
  from the government.  Having more information is usually
  a good thing; currently the prosecutor knows what he's doing,
  so to speak, but we don't.

@_subject: MIB Subponeas 
Toad has encouraged publication of any other subpoenas in the Toto-assassination case, and we've asked for info on any other solicitations by the MIBs to list subscribers, or others, such as that to Alan Greenspan posted here.
It's understandable that anyone served or solicited might want to keep that private, upon legal advice, or for self-protection.
However, it'd be a help to those of us awaiting the slug, or wanting
to aid and abet the MIB-fed fictional conspiracy, to know what is happening. For example, the dates of contact, when the documents were served and the means used, what was asked for, or anything that might be shared without necessarily identifying who was contacted. Anon to the list or to jya if preferred.
For example, Alcatraz's subpoena was dated October 9, for a
GJ session on November 10. We don't know when the subpoena was served or how. And how those dates and compare to those of Huntsville's, though in latter case we've been told the subpoena came with two MIBs.
JYA'd like to be in Tacoma when the WWA GJ is MIB imaginary
totostimony, either in response to character-assassinatory subpoena or by idly hanging out with attention-seeking gov assassination-groupies,  so some times and dates would be helpful if different from November 10.
Bee in the bonnet: A few days before CJ's arrest warrant was issued the DoJ put out a study on the "Shared Traits of Potential Assassins:"
   The traits:
    * To achieve notoriety or fame.
    * To bring attention to a personal or public problem.

What? The ambitious MIB job description mirrors the Cypherpunk agenda?
The PR on the report goes on:
      The report outlines how law enforcement agencies can establish programs
  and systems to identify and prevent persons with the means and interest to
  attack a protected person.  The guide may also assist law enforcement and
  security agencies responsible for investigating and preventing other
kinds of
  targeted violence, such as stalking, domestic violence or workplace
  The report takes law enforcement agencies through the entire threat
  process, from designing a protective intelligence program to investigating
  suspicious persons to closing a case.
      Protective intelligence programs are based on the idea that the risk of
  violence is minimized if persons with the interest, capacity and willingness
  to mount an attack can be identified and rendered harmless before they
  approach a protected person.

Maybe the Feds have more on CJ than what's in Jeff
Gordon's complaint and it was provided to the Grand
Jury for the indictment, but maybe not. The alleged threat to murder federal officials surely ricochets noisily in governmental brainpans.
It's probable that law enforcement and judicial circles have a secret treasure of confidential warnings, alerts and operations about gland-thrilling potential threats -- of which the DoJ study cited here is only one peek into Pandora's twat,
wet just so to enthrall the high benchers and avid affidavites.
Domestic terrorism looms large in boosting security budgets and for rouging the mundane, boring justice system grinding ever so drearily, getting so little appreciation what with the luridities of the Billy-Kenny crotch graball, and the newsy African
bombings and cruise attacks -- what's a Public Servant got to
do to get what's due for self-sacrifice. Why finger an assassin, thank you god for Jim and CJ, for bottomless cypherpunks
conspiracy afermenting.
For example, I spoke to the Estevan police about CJ's arrest
warrant and was told that it was for a non-extraditable offense.
So there's not much pressure coming from Canada despite
Jeff's citing that background in his complaint. I asked for docs
to flesh out Jeff's complaint but couldn't get any.
Then we know that the Secret Service interviewed CJ but took
no action on his alleged threats against DC pols (and maybe against others -- there's another aspect of CJ threats that a cpunk might want to amplify).
And there's no evidence so far of FBI involvement in CJ's case,
which as noted here is somewhat hard to understand where
there's a threat of murdering federal officials. Why the IRS is the
principal investigative office for what is no longer merely an IRS matter is not yet answerable based on what's public.
It could be that a broader investigation is underway and Jeff's
is a cover. Let us pray for that, that thanks to Jim Bell and CJ we'll all be hyperlinked to International Terrorism, the surefire stage
for rep building, raking dollars, the spunk of cpunk.
Wasn't that the characteristics of the American Dream in the DoJ list of assassin traits? Particularly, the lust to be cop-killed, or to forfeit property fast, whichever.

[Misspelled subject corrected - my initial fault, SSM.]
Tim points out the risks of Grand Jury appearance and need
for legal counsel outside the hearing.
We'll add that it's fairly common to use Grand Jury testimony
to ensnare a target - and not only Bill - who thinks there's not
much to worry about based on the friendly strokes beforehand
by velvet-gloved agents. It's the false testimony, perjury, that sinks the hook. Especially when hit with unexpected questions about matters for which
no preparation has been made, those usually completely unlike what the friendly agents suggested was the main reason for politely asking for cooperation (not telling what they already
knew the target knows and will try to hide). Presumably an attorney would prepare for this, but not all, especially if time is limited and the target does not think there's any need to fully brief counsel (even dare to fancy lawyers
aint so smart).
A prime suspect in the African Embassy bombings, US citizen Wadi el Hage, was induced to come up to NYC from Texas in this fashion, testified before the GJ and was immediately arrested for giving false testimony to questions ranging over several years of his experiences and prior statements to the FBI. The Q&A can
be seen at:
   Note that while all the bombers are charged with murder, el Hage
is multiply-charged with perjury.
Note also that all the suspects used a variety of aliases, so the
Feds allege, just like CJ is mani-nymed in Gilmore's subpoena.
Also, in this case at least two of the four suspects have recently
been isolated from outside contact, on the pretext that they may
communicate orders to "terrorists," but, more probably because they
are cooperating with prosecutors who do not want the lovely
relationship to be interrupted by outsiders. Or the Feds want to
send a signal that that is the case to spook those being sought,
and the two not cooperating.
As Jim Choate noted, the implied threat of hellish treatment if
you don't cooperate produces heebie-jeebies and overhwhelming
desire to get your life back to normal everyday, familiar panic. And if you're in jail nursed by MIB and strangers in stripes, such a threat erodes what's left of your iron discipline to never, ever squeal on comrades.
NY Times front-paged yesterday the controversy over prosecutors
offering leniency for testifying against cohorts. During the summer
an appeals panel declared such practice be bribery prohibited under a 50-year-old law and ruled that it is illegal. Within hours a higher court overruled the panel, and the issue is expected to go to the Supremes.
Even so, the panel made some indelible remarks about prosecutors
not being above the law:
  In their densely worded opinion, the panel examined precedents
  as far back as the Magna Carta, which imposed limits on the
  exercise of sovereign power. The law prohibiting "whoever" from
  offering a witness anything of value in exchange for testimony
  should apply, the judges said, to prosecutors as well as to
  everyone else.
  "Decency, security and liberty alike," the panel said, "demand that
  Government officials shall be subject to the same rules of conduct
  that are commands to the citizen."
As expected, prosecutors were furious at the panel's decision, as
were many judges, claiming that the practice was hundreds of years
old and convictions could not be obtained without it. One judge said
the decision was "amazingly unsound, not to mention nonsensical."
The Times notes that the Miranda decision got the same reception,
and was fought fiercely by the status quo investors in the justice It's a good article for preparing to meet the good and bad MIB trolling
for all too trusting, easily spooked rubes, a/k/a terrorists, a/k/a assassins.

It's quite surprising in that the recommended policy
is to not arrest potential assassins but to attempt to
persuade them to give up their plans to attack, to establish trust in the LEAs who are encouraged to listen to grievances, and helpfully arrange for treatment of whatever underlies the menace.
It seems that most who threaten assassination do
not go through with it, but do enjoy the attention it
gets, so the report reassuringly states. Hmm.

rational about why the deed is necessary -- even
those who are mentally unstable are totally sane
in preparing for and executing attacks.
All in all, the report says assassination is not a big deal
for it doesn't happen all that much, and the task at hand is to prevent rash acts by friendly persuasion and TLC.
And brace for the assassins who never give a clue of
what's coming.
So what is going on with CJ and Jim Bell? Scare sense into them, followed by caregiving, or serious jail time?

Two men convicted in biological weapons case
October 30, 1998
Web posted at: 3:10 a.m. EST (0810 GMT) BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Two men accused of scheming to attack President Clinton and others with cigarette lighters equipped with poison-coated cactus needles were convicted of sending threatening e-mail. Johnie Wise, 72, and Jack Abbott Grebe, 43, were convicted Thursday of two counts of sending threatening e-mails -- one message to the Internal Revenue Service and one to the Drug Enforcement Agency. Grebe and Wise were acquitted on one count each of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction count and five counts each of sending threatening messages -- to President Clinton, U.S. Customs, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, and the Secret Service. They could get life in prison at their Jan. 29 sentencing. Prosecutors said Wise schemed to modify a cigarette lighter so it would shoot cactus needles coated with toxins such as rabies, botulism, anthrax or HIV. Defense attorneys called idea 'silly'
Among the men's alleged targets: Clinton, the U.S. and Texas attorneys general, and FBI Director Louis Freeh. Defense attorneys called the idea "silly" and "cockamamie." There was never any evidence that the accused possessed biological weapons or tried to develop a deadly lighter. The e-mailed threats were vaguely worded and did not discuss the lighter or cactus thorns. Under federal law, however, the threats were enough for a conviction and no biological weapons were needed, prosecutors said. The men would have carried out their plan to hurt government employees and their families if they hadn't been arrested, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mervyn Mosbacker said. Wise and Grebe were accused of concocting the plan to threaten government officials with e-mails. One e-mail, sent June 12, was titled "Declaration of War" and a second one, sent June 26, said government workers had been "targeted for destruction by revenge." A third defendant, Oliver Dean Emigh, 63, was acquitted on all counts. He was accused of writing the June 12 message, but the charges against the men stemmed from the June 26 e-mail.

Tim asks:
Threat of terrorism will be the impetus for applying national security restrictions domestically, for relaxing cold war limitations on spying
on Americans, for dissolving barriers between law enforcement
and military/intelligence agencies.
Technical means for access to encrypted data will probably
come first in communications, then to stored material. There
will be an agreement for increased CALEA wiretap funding, which is what the two cellular and wired suits against the FBI intend,
(paralleling what the hardware and software industries want from
federal buyers of security products).
This will provide the infrastructural regime for the gov to monitor and store domestic traffic as NSA does for the global, using the same technology (NSA may provide service to domestic
LEA as it now does for other gov customers for intel).
Other access will come through hardware and software for
computers, paralleling technology developed for telecomm tapping,
tracking and monitoring. Most probably through overt/covert features of microprocessors and OS's, as reported recently of Wintel and others, but also probably with special chips for DSP and software for modular design -- why build from scratch when these handy kits are As noted here, the features will appear first as optional, in response
to demand from commerce, from parents, from responsible
institutions, to meet public calls for protection, for privacy, for
combating threats to the American people. Like wiretap law, use of the features for preventative snooping will initially require a court order, as provided in several of the crypto legislative proposals.
Like the wiretap orders, gradually there will be no secret court refusals for requests to use the technology in the national interest.
A publicity campain will proclaims that citizens with nothing to hide will have nothing to fear. Assurance of safety will be transparent, no clicks on the line. In a digital world, home-office devices will send
lifestyle data to the device manufacturers over the always monitoring transparental Net.

Bear in mind that that information on this matter may be used to hammer or help Carl Johnson if not others.
As Adam Back has proposed: To check the validity of the allegations made by the IRS about Toto(s)'s messages in the Carl Johnson complaint, a review is underway of archived messages to see if there are any signatures by a key before the private key has been posted, especially if the post in question has been (or may be later) cited by the IRS.  If there are none, then the IRS "authentication" of the claimed Toto posts evaporates.  Even if there are some, the `authentication' becomes more suspect if there are others which are made after the key post.

Below is a 1994 thumbnail description of the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, taken from a long, critical report on prisoner health care with more on the Springfield
facility available at:

Bureau of Prisons Health Care: Inmates' Access to Health Care Is Limited
by Lack of Clinical Staff (Letter Report, 02/10/94, GAO/HEHS-94-36).
SPRINGFIELD MEDICAL REFERRAL CENTER
   MISSION OF REFERRAL CENTER
The U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield,
Missouri, is one of the Bureau of Prisons' six referral centers that
treat male medical, surgical, and mental health patients.
   LOCATION AND CONDITION OF FACILITY
The Springfield Medical Referral Center is an administrative
facility, meaning it is equipped to house inmates of all security
levels.  It was built about 1933.  Inmates live in six connected
buildings, each of two or three stories.  The medical facilities are
concentrated in four of the six buildings.  The acute and chronic
care medical and surgical patients are housed in units that resemble
typical hospital rooms, except that several rooms in each unit have
locked doors.  These locked cells are used for patients who are (1)
dangerous to staff or other inmates, (2) participating in the federal
witness protection program, or (3) waiting for their custody status
to be determined.  The mental health patients are housed in units
that resemble typical prison cell blocks with one-man cells.
Springfield also has a unit that can contain up to 37 inmates in
individual locked cells for disciplinary or protective reasons.
   NUMBER OF INMATES AND PATIENTS SERVED
Springfield serves approximately 1,120 inmates, including 439
patients who require medical or surgical care and 294 who need
psychiatric care.  The medical and surgical care is provided to about
46 acute care patients, 54 patients receiving renal dialysis, and 393
other chronic or recovering patients.  The mental health population
includes 177 treatment patients and 117 forensic inmates who are
being evaluated for their mental ability to stand trial.
   NUMBER AND TYPE OF MEDICAL BEDS
The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
rates Springfield as a 46-bed acute care and 177-bed mental health
   NUMBER AND TYPE OF STAFF POSITIONS AUTHORIZED    AND FILLED
In July 1993, Springfield had 279 authorized health care positions,
including 5 psychiatrists, 15 medical/surgical physicians, an
optometrist, 12 physician assistants, 127 nurses, 9 pharmacists, 12
psychologists, 6 quality assurance staff, 10 medical records staff,
and 82 other health care staff.  At that time, 18 positions were
vacant, including 3 medical physicians, a surgeon, a psychiatrist, a
physician assistant, 10 nurses, 1 medical records staff, and 1 other
health care staff.  The following specialists were working at
Springfield:  3 general practitioners, 4 psychiatrists, 2 internists, 2 neurologists, 1 physiatrist, 1 anesthesiologist, 1 orthopedic surgeon, and 1 chief of health programs.
Physicians and physician assistants are available 24 hours a day.
However, physicians generally work from 7:30 a.m.  to 4:00 p.m.
During the evening and night shifts and on weekends, one physician,
one psychiatrist, and one psychologist are on call.  Physician
assistants are available in the facility 16 hours a day.  Nurses are
responsible for medical care between 10:00 p.m.  and 6:00 a.m.
Nursing service is provided 24 hours a day.
   STAFF ORGANIZATION
The Associate Warden for Medical Services supervises most of
Springfield's health care staff, including nurses and technicians.
The Clinical Director is responsible for the internal medicine
physicians, psychiatrists, surgeons, dentists, physician assistants,
the quality assurance coordinator, utilization manager, and
infection-control practitioners.  The Associate Warden for Mental
Health Services is responsible for the psychologists and social
workers who work with the mental health patients.

There's talk of a paper given at Crypto98 on "Impossible
Differential Analysis" which got the NSA people scribbling
like mad taking notes as though this was something that
had never come up at the agency and they'd better get
right on it.
Roughly, as I heard it (and I may be way off), the premise is that instead of using differential analysis for finding weaknesses in a cipher, to flip that to determine what could not possibly be a weakness in a cipher and build one with just those attributes.
Is this report correct, and is there a source for that paper?

Is there a PKZip-encryption cracker online for the following program which claims to offer a link to a couple of dozen shareware password crackers of
popular programs?  The exe-file is easily downloaded. There's a copy for testing for privacy protection:
    (20K)
Investigating the Suspect Computer
PC Data Recovery for the Criminal Investigator
Law Enforcement Use Only
   http//
WHAT EXACTLY, DOES THE SOFTWARE DO ? The software is designed to almost completely automate
the formidable task of extracting forensic data from
today's modern personal computers with large or multiple
hard drives. The program automatically examines startup
files for "booby traps", and searches the entire machine
for "bomb" programs which, if triggered, could destroy
valuable evidence on the machine. PC-Investigator runs
exclusively from diskette, at the DOS level, and does
NOT perform any write operations to the hard drive. This
insures that fragile data, or files that may be evidence
which have been deleted, or are resident in "slack
space", are not inadvertently overwritten. A unique feature of the software is the ability to construct
custom-tailored reports. The catalog function extracts
and organizes all the files on the hard drive, and sorts
them into order by type, date and time, according to
directory. During this process, all the readable (text) files
are extracted into a separate list, and are organized by
type in the report. Also available is an extracted report
listing of graphic (picture) files, and files that are typically used on the Internet, along with an extracted list of word processor files, backup files, ASCII text, and files that are recovered by CHKDSK or SCANDISK, which are
commonly overlooked as a source of forensic evidence. PC-Investigator has unique features that duplicate the
manual functions normally performed during such
forensic investigations. The most valuable feature is the
ability to search all the files on the disk for the presence
of up to 600 words or phrases called HotWords, that you
supply in an editable file. This function is the equivalent
of the manual process of "Find Files and Folders" / "Files
Containing" under Windows 95 , which typically takes
30 seconds to 3 minutes to do manually for each word or
phrase you are looking for. The function is performed
using words and phrases from the HotWord list,
hundreds of times per second.
A typical 2 Gigabyte hard drive may contain over 500
readable text files. A manual search for the occurrence of
a single word or phrase occurring in those files typically
takes 90 seconds. If you had to search for those 200
words manually, the time required would be  5 hours at
the keyboard. The HotWord search feature of PC-
Investigator performs this function on a 486/50 machine
in just under 45 minutes. If the number of files to be
searched is substantially higher, such as on today's large
hard drives (typically 2 to 4 Gigabytes, with 12 Gigabyte
drives available on top-end systems) the time required to
perform an exhaustive search would be proportionately
higher (500 to 1,000 man-hours). PC-Investigator
completely searches a 2 Gigabyte drive n a 486/120
machine in just under 24 hours. The faster the processor,
and hard disk controller, the faster the program will run to
completion. The best part is that each file containing any of the words
or phrases in your list is cataloged in the report, along
with the number of "hits" or HotWords found in the file.
After the program is started, and the desired options are
selected, the program will run un-attended, doing the
work that would normally not be done in such cases
because of the tremendous amount of time and effort
involved. Of course, files which do not contain "clear
text", or are DES or BLOWFISH / PGP encrypted will not
be flagged by the program. However, we have software
which addresses the problem of APPLICATION
encryption - that is - files which are encrypted by the
application which created them. For example, LOTUS
123, Quick Books, PFS Professional, and WordPerfect
are among the few programs which offer in-application
encryption of files. The program does NOT extract or examine the data from
"slack space". However, running the program is easy,
and can be done by almost anyone with a bit of computer
skills. The software is designed as a preliminary
investigative tool, to determine if a machine should be
examined by a professional. If this program indicates a
"HOT" machine, you can be certain that a more
extensive investigation is warranted.              -----

We attended Defense Secretary Cohen's talk today at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City on "Security in a Grave World."
While not included in the prepared text, Secretary Cohen remarked in the Q&A on terrorism and encryption policy that Americans will have to decide how much privacy they will be willing to give up for protection against terrorism, and cited the FBI's similar views on the threat of encryption use by terrorists. Afterwards I had an informative chat with Kenneth Bacon, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, to ask about interviewing Secretary Cohen on Echelon, the global electronic intercept and surveillance system operated by the National Security Agency. Mr. Bacon said the Department will not comment on such matters. I acknowledged that was the case heretofore, but with intense European interest in Echelon, I asked if would it be possible for Secretary Cohen to give a statement on the topic.
I noted that Secretary Cohen in his talk today had listed international cooperation as a principal need of US defense policy, and that Echelon had raised considerable suspicion of US interception and surveillance prowess which could inhibit international trust and cooperation. I also asked Mr. Bacon if Secretary Cohen could discuss as well the possibility of further declassification of secret technology, as with the Skipjack encryption algorithm, to enhance US economic security and for protection against information espionage. Mr. Bacon said that others in the Department would be more appropriate to discuss such topics in detail then Secretary Cohen. I asked if anyone except the Secretary had authority to discuss Echelon and declassification of secret technology. Mr. Bacon would not answer that but suggested I send a letter proposing such topics for discussion and the Department will respond.

Dear Mr. Bacon,
Three points of Secretary Cohen's informative talk[*] at the Council on Foreign Relations last evening would benefit
by amplification, and I ask your assistance in arranging an
interview with the Secretary to focus on the Department's
policy on information security technology.
1. The first concerns his view on the interdependency of military
and economic affairs for assurance of national security.
1.1 What does he see as the prospect for further declassification of restricted defense technology for use by industry for protection of information against economic espionage, as exemplified in the declassification of the Skipjack encryption algorithm. 1.2 And what other services and/or technology the defense supply
and intelligence agencies may provide non-governmental customers in competition with other nations where closer cooperation between such agencies and industry is more common.
2. The second concerns the need for international cooperation
for US defense policy and how that is impacted by publicity and criticism of the Echelon electronic intercept program and other
national technical means not customarily discussed in public by the Department.
2.1 What are Secretary Cohen's views of programs such as Echelon political and international trust issues and what he is his view of European calls for investigation of Echelon.
2.2 What are Secretary Cohen's views as a constructive response to charges that Echelon and other national technical means are offensive military and economic espionage against those from whom the US desires defense cooperation.
3. In the Q&A on the topic of terrorism and encryption, Secretary Cohen remarked that the American people will have to decide how much privacy they are willing to give up in order to be protected from
terrorist threats.
3.1 What are the Secretary's views on how disputes on encryption
policy could be resolved in light of his calls for closer connection
between military and economic interests and for international cooperation for defense policy.
Your office has always been exemplary in responding to requests
for information. Thank you very much.

@_subject: Crypto Deals 
News of easing US crypto limits sounds like the pr-fluff
put out in the summer for easing controls only for financial
institutions -- BXA is scheduled to release the rule
for that about now (originally set to be "near Labor Day"). If the news is about this rule, it may allow a few more "reputable institutions" to get the privilege traditionally extended to banks, so long as longstanding cooperation with
government is assured.
There's a report out of France on the government's issue of
a paper on crypto policy that reaffirms GAK for electronic
commerce with zero protection of privacy:
   There will probably be more such papers issued as international
cooperation to control encryption is codified in accordance
with the Wassenaar Arrangement and whatever secret
agreements Aron and others have concluded. The US version will probably come out gradually as global agreements are firmed up, Congress is briefed, and US agencies are satisfied that export holes in other countries have been closed.
Then watch for domestic clampdown on encryption, as Cohen and others have warned must be done to protect the populace from
too much freedom.
The secret deals among governments to share technology for information
security and electronic surveillance in return for global controls must be wonderful reads of duplicity and disinformation, among the participants
in the classified parts, and among the populace in the public versions.
On a related topic, weakness of DES, the ANSI X9 committee handling
cryptography has circulated a draft paper on what banks should do in response to recent successful cracks of DES:

THE WHITE HOUSE
                       Office of the Press Secretary
For Immediate Release
September 16, 1998
                     STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY
                 Administration Updates Encryption Policy
     The Clinton Administration today announced a series of steps to update
its encryption policy in a way that meets the full range of national
interests:  promotes electronic commerce, supports law enforcement and
national security and protects privacy.  These steps are a result of
several months of intensive dialogue between the government and U.S.
industry, the law enforcement community and privacy groups that was called
for by the Vice President and supported by members of Congress.
     As the Vice President stated in a letter to Senator Daschle, the
Administration remains committed to assuring that the nation?s law
enforcement community will be able to access, under strictly defined legal
procedures, the plain text of criminally related communications and stored
information.   The Administration intends to support FBI?s establishment of
a technical support center to help build the technical capacity of law
enforcement - Federal, State, and local - to stay abreast of advancing
communications technology.
     The Administration will also strengthen its support for electronic
commerce by permitting the export of strong encryption when used to protect
sensitive financial, health, medical, and business proprietary information
in electronic form.  The updated export policy will allow U.S. companies
new opportunities to sell encryption products to almost 70 percent of the
world?s economy, including the European Union, the Caribbean and some Asian
and South American countries.  These changes in export policy were based on
input from industry groups while being protective of national security and
law enforcement interests.
     The new export guidelines will permit exports to other industries
beyond financial institutions, and further streamline exports of key
recovery products and other recoverable encryption products.  Exports to
those end users and destination countries not addressed by today?s
announcement will continue to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
     Very strong encryption with any key length (with or without key
recovery) will now be permitted for export, under license exception, to
several industry sectors.   For example, U.S. companies will be able to
export very strong encryption for use between their headquarters and their
foreign subsidiaries worldwide except the seven terrorist countries (Iran,
Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, North Korea and Cuba) to protect their sensitive
company proprietary information.
     On-line merchants in 45 countries will be able to use robust U.S.
encryption products to protect their on-line electronic commerce
transactions with their customers over the Internet.
     Insurance companies as well as the health and medical sectors in those
same 46 countries will be able to purchase and use robust U.S. encryption
products to secure health and insurance data among legitimate users such as
hospitals, health care professionals, patients, insurers and their
     The new guidelines also allow encryption hardware and software
products with encryption strength up to 56-bit DES or equivalent to be
exported without a license, after a one time technical review, to all users
outside the seven terrorist countries.    Currently, streamlined exports of
DES products are permitted for those companies that have filed key recovery
business plans.  However, with the new guidelines, key recovery business
plans will no longer be required.
     The Administration will continue to promote the development of key
recovery products by easing regulatory requirements.   For the more than 60
companies which have submitted plans to develop and market key recovery
encryption products, the six month progress reviews will no longer be
required.  Once the products are ready for market, they can be exported,
with any bit length -- without a license -- world-wide (except to terrorist
nations) after a one-time review.   Furthermore, exporters will no longer
need to name or submit additional information on a key recovery agent prior
to export.  These requirements will be removed from the regulations.
     Finally, industry has identified other so-called "recoverable"
products and techniques that allow for the recovery of plaintext by a
system or network administrator and that can also assist law enforcement
access, subject to strict procedures.   The Administration will permit
their export for use within most foreign commercial firms, and their
wholly-owned subsidiaries, in large markets, including Western Europe,
Japan and Australia, to protect their internal business proprietary
     The Administration welcomes a continued dialogue with U.S. industry
and intends to review its policy in one year to determine if additional
updates may be necessary to continue a balanced approach that protects the
public safety and national security, ensures privacy, enables continued
technology leadership by U.S. industry and promotes electronic commerce.

    Exports of 56-bit DES and equivalent products (hardware and software)
     will be streamlined (under license exception).  Requirements for key
     recovery plans are eliminated.
    Exports of unlimited strength encryption products (with or without key
     recovery) will be streamlined (under license exception) to certain
     industries.  The sectors are:
    Subsidiaries of U.S. Firms, worldwide (except seven terrorist nations).
    Insurance companies to the same 45 countries recently approved for
     exports to banks and financial institution exports.
    Health and medical organizations (including civilian government health
     agencies) in the same 45 countries.  Does not include
     biochemical/pharmaceutical manufacturers.
    On-line merchants for client-server applications, in the same 45
   countries, with the purpose of securing electronic transactions between
   merchants and their customers.  Does not include manufacturers and
   distributors of items controlled on the U.S. munitions list.
    Key Recovery products will continue to be exportable under license
     exception worldwide (except seven terrorist nations).  Review of
     foreign key recovery agents is eliminated.
    Exports of "recoverable" products will be approved to most commercial
     firms, and their wholly-owned subsidiaries, in a broad range of
     countries under encryption licensing arrangements.  This group of
     countries covers most major commercial markets including Western
     Europe, Japan, and Australia.  The policy does not include service
     providers and manufacturers and distributors of items controlled on
     the U.S. munitions list.
    Exports to end users or destinations outside this policy are possible
     on a case-by-case basis.
    Prior to export, products are subject to a one-time product technical
     review.

Excerpt from DoD transcription of Secretary of Defense Cohen's
remarks at the Council on Foreign Relations, New York City, September 14, 1998:
Let me say one other thing about terrorism.  We in this country much recognize the tension which will exist as you ask us, and we will ask all successor administrations, to protect us.  And you say, how do you protect someone against terrorists?  It means increased intelligence.  It means increased intelligence, having greater capability on the ground or from national technical sources to find out who is planning and plotting what at what place and what time.  To do that is going to put us in somewhat of a direct conflict with rights to privacy, something that we hold very dear in this country.  So the more intelligence-gathering responsibilities that any administration is going to have, there's going to come a point of tension and, indeed, friction between how much are you willing to give up in order to be secure.  Those are the kind of unpleasant choices that are going to be manifesting themselves in the near future.  We haven't really faced up to it yet.  We're starting to see some of that conflict at least intellectually develop when you see the manufacturers of software who don't like the fact that the law enforcement, the FBI, the Justice Department wants to have some method of getting into encrypted technology. You say, "Wait a minute, that's my right of privacy.  I'm a businessman or woman.  I want to be able to send information out over those -- those airwaves and have them completely protected."  Our Justice Department says, "Wait a minute, you want us to protect you.  But you're allowing criminal elements, terrorists and others
 -- organized crime, drug cartels -- to encrypt their telecommunications to the point where don't know what's going on.  And then something is going to happen, and you'll say, where were you?"
So those are the kinds of tensions that are going to continue to exist.  But we're going to have to have more intelligence to effectively deal with terrorism in the future.  [End excerpt]

Forwarded message:
I spoke with Jim last night. He had been "in the hole", as he calls it, for almost 7 days. This is when he is placed in a cell by himself on a different floor and is not
allowed out of it (they bring his food to him, instead of his going to the cafeteria, and can't go out to the social area - to play pool, for instance). He said it was because he had remarked to a warden that she had the ugliest voice in the whole world, after she repeatedly told the inmates to clean up their rooms even though they had complied
repeatedly to her demands. (I asked him if he had spent the time reading Atlas Shrugged, and he said he'd done that a bit. I don't think he's much interested in railroads, taking quite some time to get through it, although he told me he's a fast reader).
Anyway last night his things had been packed and he expected to be shipped to Oklahoma City this morning.  He will be there anywhere from half a day to two days and then be sent
on to Springfield, MO for the mental eval. Perhaps he will meet up with Toto there.
[End forward]
If it's not been mentioned here CJ was in transit to Springfield over the weekend, being held for unknown
reasons in OKC from where he called a fan who passed
on the news. He's in good spirits.
And Jim is reported to be in good spirits. So it's all
worked out, their notoriety a tonic for tired blood, try
it, depressives.
Both are sassing the jailers, getting railroaded to OKC and Springfield for a bit of mind-bending and -straightening. Are they fit to stand trial, oh yeah, do it, the snakes of Medusa.
No one knows what the OKC stopover for Jim or CJ is about,
maybe to introduce them to each other (Jim claims to not know CJ -- smart), maybe to kick dirt on the homeplate of
Murrah Memorial, get image-counseled by Anita Hill.
Jim and CJ in Springfield at the same time, getting heavy
mentaled, wordsmith assassination duelers. Now that's a Teen Spirit I'd like to smell.

CHP introduces cellular-friendly 911 system
Operators will now be able to capture the
telephone number and location of the caller
within a half-block area
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 17 - The California Highway Patrol
this week demonstrated a new countywide 911 system designed
to provide operators with the telephone numbers and
location of callers using mobile telephones.
Los Angeles County is the first in the state to use
the new technology, said CHP Sgt. Ernie Sanchez.
All local 911 calls for the CHP, whether via mobile
phones or "land lines," are routed to the CHP
half-a-millionCommunications Center just west of downtown, but mobile phone calls could not be traced until recently, Sanchez said.
"It doesnï¿½t matter if you live in Pasadena or Arcadia
or West Covina; if you call on a cell phone, that call will
go through the CHP Communications Center" and operators
will be able to capture the telephone number and location
of the caller within a half-block area, Sanchez said.
The enhanced technology has been in use for the past
three weeks, he said.
All major mobile phone companies are participating in
the test and demonstration of the system, Sanchez said,
adding that the technology should be in place nationwide by
2001 under Federal Communications Commission rules.

Here's the source for the data preservation requirement:
Preservation is not a new idea; it has been the law in the United States for nearly five years.  18 U.S.C. 2703(f) requires an electronic communications service provider to "take all necessary steps to preserve records and other evidence in its possession pending the issuance of a court order or other process" upon "the request of a governmental entity."  This applies in practice only to reasonably small amounts of specified data identified as relevant to a particular case where the service provider already has control over that data.  Similarly, as with traditional
subpoena powers, issuance of an order to an individual or corporation to produce specified data during the course of an investigation carries with it an obligation not to delete or destroy information falling within the scope of that order when that information is in the persons possession or control. 18 USC 2703(f)
(f) Requirement To Preserve Evidence.--
   (1) In general.--A provider of wire or electronic communication services or a remote computing service, upon the request of a governmental entity, shall take all necessary steps to preserve records and other evidence in its possession pending the issuance of a court order or other process.

list with the FBI, and, according to Douglas, the Bureau does not know what to make of it. Douglas said he explained how he got the list

on the Internet, and Douglas told them.

Gregory Douglas (which could be a pseudonym) has published several books on controversial matters, including a series about the head of the Gestapo, Heinrich Muller, working for the OSS and CIA for years after WW2, and living in America under an assumed identity. The official story is that Muller died at the end of WW2. Douglas claims his books on Muller are banned in Germany. Is any of this Douglas stuff true? We don't know. Nor do we know that the Crowley list is authentic despite being salted with well-known
names. Daniel Brandt thinks it is a ploy to fuck Cryptome, by whom he's not sure. We hope he's right.

Mexican traffickers have also come to dominate methamphetamine production and distribution in the United States, which had been controlled by outlaw elements in US motorcycle gangs.
US Crime Groups Abroad Some US crime groups have established cells and networks in foreign countries, and are engaged in a wide range of criminal activities. In many cases, the US crime groups use their overseas networks to acquire drugs and other illicit contraband or to prey upon US businesses, as they do in the United States.
Law enforcement authorities in other countries also report that US crime groups are involved in money laundering, extortion, prostitution, drug trafficking, firearms smuggling, car theft, street crimes, and contract murders.
The most notorious US crime groups operating overseas are outlaw elements of motorcycle gangs, according to US law enforcement agencies. Some of the approximately 900 motorcycle gangs that have been identified as having outlaw elements by US law enforcement have worldwide chapters and are expanding
into other countries at a significant rate. The increasing overseas presence of US motorcycle gangs, together with their criminal members' tendency to associate with other crime groups to further their criminal ends, are causing increasing concern among law enforcement authorities around the world. Law enforcement authorities in countries where motorcycle gangs have established themselves indicate that the motorcycle gangs are extensively involved in organized crime and have particularly bad reputations for violence, property
crimes, prostitution and extortion rackets, and trafficking in drugs and firearms.

What is not clear in Schneier's several critiques of crypto weaknesses is what will be made of them to advance the
burgeoning interests of law enforcement and the compsec
industry in cybercrime control measures.
While it may not be Bruce's intent to provide support for
"the legitimate interests of law enforcement and industry"
to combat "cybercriminality," what does appear to be
evolving from the interests of the compsec industry is
a close working relationship with the prime consumers of their services and products -- especially with
the privitazation and melding of natsec and domsec.
No doubt this is a carryover from the traditional close
relationship between compsec and comsec researchers,
developers and producers with government.
Still, is there no alternative to giving government and
corporations first, if not exclusive, choice on the best products and services, or contrarity, criminalizing activities and programs which do not succumb to government and corporate lobbying/purchasing persuasion (covert
arm-twisting; sweetheart contracts; favorable standards, regulations, exceptions, etc.)?
Count on one hand those who have resisted the lure and pressure to serve the nation as they serve their own interests. Count them stigmatized, broke, "renegades," outlaws, pitiful once-weres who lost touch with reality. Count those who are realistic as manifold, patriots, speakers at the best conclaves, propounders of sound advice to the wayward, reminders of what they've learned on the way is
no longer true, award winners, celebrities with swelling bank
accounts -- so long as the archy line is toed.
Now, none of this applies to Bruce's evolving computer
security body of work, which is most impressive. It's just not
clear what will evolve as Counterpane takes more of his
time and effort. What is clear is that cryptoanarchy, or
or broader cyberanarchy, is not in his interests, any more than it is in government's, except as a bugaboo.
Cybercrime begins with criminalizing digital information, that is, to regulate who gets access to private secrets,
who runs the protection rackets: "don't trust your
computer" is the next step after "don't trust the Internet."
Confidence in both requires the assurance services of who? Ah yes, I see.

A thoughtful summary of non-US-centric view of how US technology
could, probably will, come back to haunt and harm it.
One of the ways the US will be harmed is by provoking its
government to crackdown on what it will define as illegal
use of technology. To be sure, these perceived threats will
come from within the US as from outside.
I have seen no media attention given to DoD Cohen's warning
that technology is empowering the citizenry, business and US
allies to threaten US supremacy. Comparable, say, to the
DoJ's and the FBI's well-advanced orchestration of a global
cybercrime (successor to organized crime) fighting regime.
The acceleration of transfer of national security technology to
domestic law enforcement agencies in many countries shows
that borderlessness between external and internal threats
is becoming the norm. Such that the most advanced technology
once devoted to combatting foreign enemies is now aimed
at the populace in disregard of their home countries and
the once-vaunted privilege being free of threatened by their own governments.
Ken's point that AP is likely to be implemented by a non-US
against a US target is shrewd, and Usama Bin Laden has just
about pulled that off. If he disappears but his agenda continues
that will be pure AP. This is not to say that Bin Laden is not a fictional-demon of the USG, forever eluding capture -- until
the moment is right to implement a Pablo Escobar.
Isn't it likely that Jim Bell is just a ploy the feds are using to
arouse the tax resisters in the Northwest?
Good point, and one that the feds will happily adopt, for it is often
used by the US to warrant its need for a massively overkill defense
apparatus -- not that it ever does much with its vaunted hardware
except provide sitting ducks.

Hold on. "Needs killing" is an epithet, like "fuck your mother"
or in earlier theocratic days, "go to hell." It's a residue of a time

it because it reminds of my childhood in Texas when it was

Back then, saying "fuck your mother" was said only by the

and it always led to physical mayhem among the god-fearing who felt obliged to protect the virginity of their mother. Don't laugh. Men killed each other for that.

NIST has stated that the maximum endorsement will be to use
AES for non-classified government information. So the question
will remain of what is better than AES, or to put it another way,
what is not good enough about AES for its use on classified
To be sure it would be too much to expect that the USG would
promote a program that it could not penetrate, or to put it another
way, to openly disclose a technology it believes to provide
maximum data protection. If NSA/NIST went that far the agencies
would be shut by DC for national security reasons.
Still, one can dream of NIST/NSA slipping through a technology
stronger than the ordinary officeholding paranoid, secrecy-loving
power mongering goofus can prevent by way of elastic oversight
David Alvarez writes of the intel agencies withholding most secret
information from the president in the 30s and 40s on the belief that
that office could not be trusted to put the nation's interest above its
own urgencies to endure.
What a wonder it would be to read in say, 25 years, that NIST/NSA raced a fast one past their watchers and advanced the public's
interest over the government's. Lots of those folks are looking
forward to becoming well-paid ex-govs, having seen what lucrative benefits have come the way of those who jumped ship.
Is it conceivable that the USG's need for maximum protection of
its information would take second place to the need of the public's
protection from government? That depends on what government
workers -- especially the defense establishment defined by
Eisenhower -- believe their future to be.
The burgeoning market for dual use technologies is surely
going to change the way globalism gets implemented, now that
so many of those who fostered those technologies are coming
into the marketplace as hungry players, not merely underwriters and regulators. This applies not only to the the former Soviet

@_subject: CDR: RE: Musings on AES and DES 
References: It could be that AES will be used as part of an ensemble
for protecting classified information. The few Type 1 systems
that are publicly described never use only a single algorithm
without supplementary programs for enhancing cryptanalytic
protection. Belt and suspenders and probably additional
support in hardware systems not spelled out.
Presumably there are software and hardware add-ons
which are easily not available and which could counter
known cryptanalytic methods of cracking and of tampering,
some of which have been mentioned here recently.
This would conform to military doctrine which states that it must be assumed that the enemy knows everything
you do, but lacks information on when, where and how
you will apply what you know. Thus the need for multiple
strategies, multiple weapons, multiple programs of
disinformation, ploys, strategems, betrayals and theft
of secrets.
Recall the program NSA and CIA runs to break-in to
get what cannot be electronically intercepted. Similarly,
brute force to attack software is matched, indeed, amplified,
by brute force to physically steal. As with the long-standing
practice of the FBI and domestic law enforcement agencies.
So AES could be seen as a consumer assurance technology,
to deter the ordinary burglar and biz-bandit like yourself, but in no way impede a global intelligence cartel which believes it has
a right to everybody's private affairs.
Have a read of USSID 18 over at the National Security Archives
which ostensibly prohibits the NSA from spying on Americans.
Parts of it are remarkably similar to gov statements on AES,
the parts that assure trustworthinesss of the authors.
No military professional would believe any such fluff was
anything more than artful deception.
None of these remarks are directed at the AES competitors,
but at the purpose of the public competition and disavowals
that have accrued during it. The fine print, very fine, virtually
invisible ploys.

Bruce Schneier, among others, argues that strength of
algorithm is not a reliable determinant of security of
information. That most successful attacks occur through more accessible weaknesses, the prime one being
human. Bruce reviews several of these in his October 15
Crypto-Gram, and refers to his latest book for more
cybersecurity threats that crypto cannot defend.
Ross Anderson, among others (some here), claim that
chips are readily vulnerable to tampering, and that poses
a much greater risk than algo attacks.
Programs and people which just grab info directly from
your box and bunker through B&E software and black
bag jobs cannot be stopped by mathematics, though
encrypted info might remain inaccessible.
Lifting electromagnetically emanated data, say, that from
keyboard to cpu, before it is encrypted, is still a threat,
not limited to classified technology, as demonstrated
by Ross Anderson, Markus Kuhn and others, and
reviewed here recently.
Cryptanalysis may be the most crucial technology in the
world today, as it has been well before mathematical
encipherment. How it is being done is probably the
most closely guarded secret, and part of that protection
is zero information. Share encryption information, yes,
but not decrypt, not even a hint. Blow sunshine about
algo strength and unbreakability, yes, that would be in What intrigues is the national security benefit of fostering
the growth of public encryption, despite the claims that
it makes global surveillance more difficult. If a public
encryption enterprise didn't exist it would have to be
invented to divert the attackers from genuine threats
and weaknesses, as well as embed in the public
realm a technology for covert snooping inside the
Medeco pretense.

     (77KB)
Here is an excerpt:
"We interviewed about one hundred people in the Agency, including most senior leaders, and asked very specific questions about the way people operate and the embedded culture. We learned the Agency is a very bureaucratic government organization, and that most of the behavior patterns were established during the 1970s and 1980s when there was plenty of money to execute its mission. NSA appears to operate like an entitlement program. Most people in the Agency are highly motivated and work very hard, but a portion does not.
We also found a leadership culture that appears most interested in focusing on their positions and protecting their people's jobs at the expense of accomplishing the Most of the people at NSA are hired night out of college and spend their entire lives in the Agency. Regardless of their work performance and their job responsibility, the Agency promotes people roughly at the same rate. The institution encouraged people to get deeply involved in the promotion process, to the point that civilian personnel wrote their own promotion reports, and supervisors endorsed the reports even if they did not agree, mostly to prevent animosity.
However, the most critical aspect of the people and culture in the institution was the mindset related to lack of empowerment and accountability.
NSA's present culture overemphasizes loyalty to a particular function and its associated senior leadership, instead of full and frank discussions of problems, issues and concerns. This has created a culture that discourages sending bad news up the chain of command. The staff knows NSA is falling behind and is not properly addressing the inherent problems of the emerging global network, and the present management infrastructure does not appear to be supporting the required changes.
In addition, we are concerned the present mindset fostered a society where people were afraid to express their own thoughts. Even though people spoke to us with true candor, they always wanted to avoid attribution because of the perception that the information was going to be used against them."

local officials and so on. We ran across a presentation
by a DoJ official in which he outlines progress of the
program and how to address the conflict posed by
information collection technology for privacy concerns of citizens and organizations:

He advocates that despite the "tension between justice
needs and privacy concerns," tools for information collection and sharing be provided the national justice system as soon as possible, while a campaign is initiated to address privacy concerns primarily by PR among
US, Canadian, UN and other cooperating agencies. He observes that local parties are not always sensitive to privacy concerns and that they may need education -- but that is not to hold up getting them the tools they need to collect information on citizens.
He also notes that current laws do not adequately cover
today's and tomorrow's technology for collecting and
sharing information. What technology besides Carnivore is outside the law?

This report is consistent with DoJ's advocacy of a US national,
as well as international, system for police agencies to collect
and share criminal justice information, and to do so while there is no law against using advanced technology for this purpose.
As noted here recently, see a presentation by DoJ on how to override with a PR campaign citizens' concerns with privacy violations of such systems:
   This continues the transfer and use of technology developed
for national security purposes to law enforcement agencies,
worldwide, with the initiative being taken by DoJ and FBI,
assisted and advised by DoD and the intel community (with
former members of the latter now employed by domestic
agencies or running companies selling natsec-derived
services to domestic customers).
What is fascinating about this evolution is the screaming
by domestic victims when they learn that means and methods are being applied to them that they wholeheartedly approve when aimed at foreigners, immigrants, criminals and other stigmatized targets such as radicals, anarchists, commies, neo-nazis, dissidents and whoever is different from you and me, well, no doubt you include me in your bullseye and me you when we get a whiff of the terrifying scent spread
by the malodor-spreading criminal justice mongerers.
Nothing about this whipsawing of terror and anti-terror
technology is new to this forum, but the news reports do
confirm the need to keep grinding out new outlaw means and methods to defy the inlaw ("justice", crime-fighting)
initiatives that just cant spend money fast enough to abrade and salve. The invention of new (advanced-tech) criminality is high on the agenda, right up there with the propagation of assurance that only governments can combat burgeoning national and economic security-threatening outlawry.
What is not said, or maybe only whispered to oversighters
hairy ears, is do not ask us to look into mirrors to see
true outlaws agrinning. Do not ask us to conduct our
affairs in non-outlaw secret settings.
Turncoats are a special feature of the official outlaw
cartel, when those who once faught official criminality are
recruited to ID, track, provoke, gather evidence, indict
and convict former associates. Read Michael Froomkin
on ICANN's board members who cant forgo power-
   This is a tip of the iceberg of large numbers of means
and methods technicians being drawn into the global
justice system with sweetheart contracts and jobs and
places on advisory boards. To serve the national interest
and to get regular whisperings from those in the know it
all business.

@_subject: CDR: Re: export reg timewarp? (Re: RC4 source as a literate program) 
Good point, except that PGP.com and Freeware still have export
restrictions on downloads, as do most other US crypto export
sites. This is probably due to the fact that nobody understands
the export regs and better safe than lose out on fat government
contracts, and corollary contracts with other corporations who
dare not offend the authorities.
Even some private sites which rushed to offer crypto on the Internet
have withdrawn their offerings. And, according to Matt Blaze's
tabulation of such offerings, they have nearly petered out.
Don't forget that there is till a review required by BXA for strongest products. What happens in those reviews has not been disclosed as far as I know. Whether the NDA is voluntary to hide trade
secrets, compulsary to hide dirty dealing, or worse to hide
really nasty access requirements -- probably some of all
these in the great American tradition of promising much and
delivering not so much unless you play ball under the umpires
clubhouse rules.
Nicky Hager (of Secret Power fame) co-wrote another book
on a PR war in NZ in which he covered at length the practice
of governments and corporations hiding their filthy deals from
freedom of information access through the loophole of
protecting proprietary information from the public.
Another commentator pointed out recently that the vast
majority of FOIA requests are indeed made by people
seeking commercial intelligence which is not intended to
be made public , and relatively few seeking information to release to the public.
So there is a bind on getting info on what actually happens
at BXA and its co-agencies during crypto export review.
However, in contrast to a few years back, I don't see many corporations or individuals calling for greater access to closed information about crypto export procedures.
Could be all the crypto folks are doing just fine under
the system, so why bitch about making it into the comfort
zone. And, oh yeah, fuck the public interest now that
the crypto public outreach PR campaigns did their job to get inside the sweetheart PR loophole.
Doug Porter has written an interesting update about all this crypto flim-flam in the "Pocket Guide to NSA Sabotage:"
   And what the fuck is Schneier doing trashing crypto to build
his security consulting business? That sounds like priests
preaching Our Church Alone salvation to keep the flock frightened, dependent and shelling out for long term protection contracts. You know, like the one-world feds and all-world spooks.

Hironari Noda, the ex-official in the Japanese Public Security Investigation Agency, was arrested
   The charge is assaulting one of the PSIA agents
who were constantly surveilling Noda.
Noda has been getting information from former
colleagues about upcoming raids by PSIA and showing
up to videotape them. Noda has been reporting on PSIA activities to a public bulletin board.
This has led to a series of confrontations at raids
and increased harassment of Noda with ostentatious
surveillance and tailing. A couple of days ago Noda verbally insulted a PSIA watchdog through a closed car window. The watchdog yelled you touched me (touching is a legal offense, insulting is not) and called the cops. The cops dutifully arranged a raid a day later, kicked
in Noda's door while he was emailing and phoning
friends about the assault, and arrested him -- claiming
his description of the raid by telephone and email constituted assault.
One of the raiders was an undercover PSIA agent
who posed as an AUM groupie to infiltrate an AUM
fan club -- several clubs have arisen that collect
AUM memorabilia and mementos. The cover agent
was said to have posted to an AUM fan BB that a gas attack was imminent. No doubt a technique learned at

References:  <200103311235.HAA03617
Bear in mind that when I appeared before the grand jury, all
the charges against Bell has been made, and no new ones
have been lodged, AFAIK. As with CJ, there were public
warnings made by the feds through disclosures of continuing
grand jury investigations. This tactic has been described as
"witness coercion," to assure that witnesses, and prospective
witnesses who learn of the active GJ, are intimidated by what may be done to them if they fancy challenging the The GJ did ask me about AP, though Robb London did not.
I stated the scheme was considered to be unworkable by
persons more qualified to judge it than me. Still, a juror
persisted, why did you publish it. I said for informational
purposes about evolving technology.
There were other questions from the jury, not London,
about disclosing information on the Internet about public
officials. London did question about my posting of the CIA
query, in particular the address of the alleged CIA employee.
And questioned Bell's postings on the same topic.
My assumption is that it is those postings which I will be
asked to testify about. But AP is always looming, and I think
basebuilding for a future attack is in the works despite the
recent overturn of the anti-abotionists' case. Officials believe
they deserve more protection for their privileges than the Beyond that, though, there remains the question of what
else might be coming from the grand jury, whether to
come in fact, or to come in the form of coercion to not
fuck with Sam. Sandy's note on Sam's pressure pointing
is apt -- whether Bell, Declan, me or the othjer witnesses
yet unknown. And publicly naming a cypherpunk Bell called from jail is typical fear-mongering as with subpoenas.
I've warned two reporters they should expect no privileged
protection in the Bell case and its likely followup cases -- the stakes are too high for burgeoning anti-terrorism to allow legacy press perks get in the way of high-reward homeland defense. One reporter said no way would they come after me, and they allegedly have. The other reporter said not me, and they did.
One reporter said I was too conspiratorial. And he has
repeated that here. One thing I've learned from that
simple-mindedness is be wary of disingenuous distancing
of person's kindly convictions from his vicious job requirements to hang your ass in the public interest,
er, to see that justice is done, er, balance viewpoints.
Sure, I'm ranting, you see the feds got a wad of my
self-incriminating material. And cpunk archives offer much an e-goldmine of cypherpunks movements.

a luxurious justice system: the courthouse, the judge,

This Task Force will explore the intelligence ramifications posed by a changing spectrum of threat regimes, including biological, chemical, information, nuclear, and radiological weapons.
    The mission of the Defense Science Board is to advise the Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology & Logistics on scientific and technical matters as they affect the perceived needs of the Department of Defense. At this meeting, the Defense Science Board Task Force will: consider the board spectrum of intelligence issues from early threat detection to deterrence, through response--including attribution; evaluate the collection and analysis of target-related information and weapon unique information; examine the role of HUMINT against these missions as well as the technology that the HUMINT collectors needs to be equipped with; consider strategic indications and warning and tactical warning dissemination and how the two need to be merged; analyze methodology to correlate large data flows spatially temporally and functionally (Low SNR); and assess the robustness of today's intelligence apparatus for coping with these challenges.
    In accordance with Section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, P.L. No. 92-463, as amended (5 U.S.C. App. II), it has been determined that this Defense Science Board meeting, concerns matters listed in 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(1), and that accordingly these meetings will be closed to the public.
    Due to critical mission requirements and scheduling conflicts, there is insufficient time to provide timely notice required by section 10(a)(2) of the

@_subject: What You Don't Know Will Kill You 
Hans Mark, a septugenarian DoD official in a seminar at Harvard on "Intelligence, Command and Control," in Spring 2000 said:
  "It is as bad to have too much information as it is not to have any.   Both contribute to Clausewitzs fog of war. It is not good to have a   completely transparent communications system. The private does   not need to know what the general knows. In fact, if the private knew   what the general knows, he might not want to go over the next hill."
Mark says he believes in unquestioned command authority as the most essential quality of the military, over weapons, strategy,
tactics and intelligence.
He acknowledged that commanders made mistakes but that history
has shown the validity of supreme command authority.
Elsewhere one reads that commanders are taught that casualties
are inevitable in war and that the resolute commander will not
hesitate to order an action that will certainly cause death.
Corollary of Mark's moral: be a commander never a follower or, best,
avoid heirarchies of rank and their promugators. Better than best
is to destroy heirarchies.
For getting followers to obey commands requires bountiful deception
and betrayal. That is called morale building, esprit de corps, patriotism, putting the nation, the unit, your comrades above your self-preservation.
Believers in heirarchies get really pissed when you question their
authority, and will kill you to show who is boss, or more likely order
an underling commander to order a blind faith warrior to do it with
a stand-off weaponry created for cowards.

Jim, I appreciate your resistance. Still, our experience on Cryptome with
offering only URLs indicates that they are little used unless there's a taste
of what is worth going to see. No doubt that it would be easiest to give only URLs and let the lazy bastards graze readers-digest crap elsewhere. But it's not the deadheads we'd like to swap info with,
for they never give back enough to make it worthwhile -- usually the
shits just send more URLs without explanation as if we can read
their profound thoughts.
What we've found is that if you treat your readers with respect they'll
give it to you, even send you stuff you'd never see otherwise. That is,
they'll inform you and educate you in ways you can't do alone, though
that shared experience isn't for everyone, I'll grant you, in particular
when you want only to talk and preach and not listen and learn.
So we've found that the better we make our samples the more likely
readers will figure we're offering something worth reading, and if they
like it they'll eventually return the favor, and if we're lucky we get
better than we offer -- indeed, that is always the case:  the best
stuff comes in from folks who figure they'd like to take part in a
mutually rewarding situation, as we see on cypherpunks.
URLs alone send a message of laziness, contempt, cluelessness about
the benefits of communication as against dancing castaway on an island.
For that solo shit you don't need CDR, the Net, the world, or think you

The IRS Criminal Investigation Handbook describes in 95
chapters the procedures for investigation of crime, preparing
for trial and a host of other activities including undercover operations and surveillance:
  The handbook aptly describes the variety of methodologies
used in the Bell and Parker cases, in particular covert methods
used to induce criminal actions for entrapment, as well as
massaging trial testimony of witnesses and agents.
The chapter on Undercover Operations provides for covertly attending client-attorney sessions; posing as an attorney, physician, clergyman, or member of the news media;
obtaining through false pretense privileged information from attorneys, physicians, clergy and news media; giving false testimony; putting innocent parties at risk of physical
violence; carrying out criminal actions; and earn income
to offset cost of the operations ("churning"):
  The chapter on Surveillance and Non-consensual Monitoring
"It is important to distinguish between investigative techniques used in surveillance activities and certain undercover operations.
The following characteristics apply to surveillance:
  The purpose is to observe ongoing activities and individuals.
  Interaction with subjects and third parties is usually not initiated.
  Conversations are incidental to the surveillance.
  Conversations are not monitored or recorded, except as set forth in   above.
  The special agent has limited cover, used to protect the integrity of   the surveillance.
  Local special agents are used.
  Special agents need not be trained in undercover techniques.
Initiated surveillance activity bears little resemblance to an undercover operation. The following situations indicate the surveillance activity evolved into an undercover operation:
  The activity continues for an extended period, and begins to focus   on certain individuals.
  Reliance on cover identities increase.
  Contacts with targets and other individuals are more in-depth.
  Agents become participants rather than observers of the activities   of interest.
The following characteristics apply to undercover operations:
  The purpose is to initiate or participate in activities with identified   targets.
  Interaction with subjects and third parties is sought.
  Undercover agents or other authorized individuals initiate and   direct conversations to further the objectives of the operation.
  Conversations may be monitored and recorded.
  The undercover agent has a documented cover. This cover is   used as a basis for contacts with targets or witnesses."

@_subject: IRS War Against US Homeland 
On the likelihood of undercover IRS agents being long active on cypherpunks, and/or the use of Jim Bell as
a lure for entrapment:
Can anyone with experience in law and/or law enforcement
comment on what other law enforcement agencies are
permitted to do what the IRS agents can, as noted here
Along with a host of other apparently criminal activities.
Or are these wide-ranging law breaking methods unique
to the IRS? If they are unique, why is that the case? Is it
because the money-raising arm of government is crucial
to all the rest?
What is striking about these criminal activities is how
similar they are to what intelligence agencies are permitted
to do for national security -- but are presumably prevented
from doing to US citizens.
This is pursuing a thought that the IRS investigators may
be the fundamental link between national security agencies
and domestic agencies, as was demonstrated at the latest
Bell trial where IRS involved a host of government agencies
in the case.
If it is IRS, not FBI, not Secret Service, not DoJ, not FEMA,
not DoD, which is leading homeland defense, that would be in conformance with the essay by Deborah Natsios on the topic
which grew out of observation of the peculiar features of
the Bell trial.
No other government agency has as much information about
US citizens as the IRS, so it would be logical for its investigative
arm to lead investigations and prosecutions for internal enemies.
And to be sure, all other agencies and branches of government
would happily look the other way while the money-raisers do
what has to be done to keep all of them in business. This, despite
faint recent criticism of IRS outlaw practices. (One might suspect
the bumbling FBI is being used as a diversion from the rise of
IRS hegemony in US law enforcement.)
And, if IRS is leading homeland defense investigation, that might
well portend most interesting days ahead for cypherpunks. As
well as heighten interest in the undercover operatives here who
presumably have been long engaged in building reputation,
confidence and trust -- or fomenting their opposites -- and
aiming at entrapment by advocating criminal behavior,
as specified by the CI Handbook.
Note that the Handbook encourages the use of private parties
as witting and unwitting undercover agents. This would include
the possibility that Jim Bell is such a wit or unwit, as well as
others who have come to his defense, or for that matter, who
have strongly attacked him. Indeed, according to the Handbook there are no innocents which
may not be drawn into combating tax crimes, no crimes that cannot be committed by undercover agents, no prohibition against false testimony, no ban on stealing privileged communications, no deception or concealment forbidden that will catch alleged or
prospective tax criminals. That is a fair description of war against America, which is another way of saying government terrorism against the homeland. I guess that makes sense for those who are determined to assure
with Italy's Interior Minister that "a state must never lose the
monopoly on the use of force" (NY Times today). Not even when
that force is applied illegally -- again as often justified in times
of war.

is set up to respond to cpunk mail.
I got subpoenaed to the grand jury and trial because
Jim Bell's responses to my messages to cpunks were

was in this case. Robb London claimed that meant
Jim and I were in direct communication when I was
doing all I could to avoid private contact with Jim, then as now. He continues to be a witting or unwitting agent of the fuckers in ensnaring stand-off supporters in

And I will ask again to all readers in the universe: do not send me private e-mail about Jim Bell, CJ, or anybody likely to be a target of the SOBs working cybercrime-rich territory. Post your stuff to a public forum, and do not cc me.

This was a show trial which had little to do with Jim Bell's

Still it was a pleasure to meet Jim in Seattle surrounded by the mighty US pro-terrorist forces, him in his ruppled prison blues,
the terrorists in camouflage suits and ties, going home at night, bragging about winning the endless war against perps, nervously
double-checking their homeland defenses.
The court's inhuman form-based judgment makes me want to

Declan, you are still tarring me with messages addressed to
me and cc'ed to cpunks. So I state: I want no direct e-mail
to me about cybercriminals convicted or likely to be that. Anybody does that after I ask them not to I will consider working with the authorities, wittingly or unwittingly.
Let me say that again, any reporter, priest, doctor, lawyer,
or any other likely undercover agent which meets with me,
sends me e-mail, telephones me, or faxes me without making that simultaneously public I will interpret as an attempt to entrap either for professional reasons or to
help the authorities or both.
Declan, I say to you, that means you. I think you are being
used as a lure just as much as Jim Bell, CJ and a several
more. Your journalistic conceit appears to be blinding you
to the threat you pose. Recall our talk about this in Seattle when you warned me that our conversations could be someday revealed in court, and that you considered your telling me that as fair warning to be careful what I told you.
This is not to single you out, I told the 60 Minutes reporters
and other journalists what I'm saying to you here. None
of you fuckers are free of being forced to tell what you
have been told in confidence, and no fair warning relieves
you of the obligation to tell those who confided in you just
what you are telling others to save your own ass.
All the privileged receivers of confidential information got
to get used to going public before they are forced to testify
in secret. That is happening now and will happen more as
the homeland war heats up and nuts and tits get squeezed.
Where am I going with this? I believe Jim Bell and CJ
were shopped to the feds, and others are probably being
shopped right now, whether on purpose or by inadvertency. I don't know who all  is involved with this shit but it is damn well is going to come out.
Best to just not pretend anymore that these privileged parties
can or will keep information confidential. That means nobody.

We'll have up this weekend a 180-page report by the Defense
Science Board on "Protecting the Homeland -- Defensive
Information Operations," a study conducted in the summer of
2000, published in March 2001, which describes in detail multi-billion dollar proposals for combating threats to the US by technologies, if not politics, promoted on this list.
It could hardly be more descriptive of the multi-agency
operations deployed in the Bell, CJ and other cybercrime trials and proposes as well what must be done to change defense, intelligence, law enforcement and civil liberties legislation to assure that defense of the homeland takes precedence over long-established rights of the citizenry.
Curiously, the document charges that DoJ and the FBI
are mulishly resisting sharing investigative information
with Defense by citing legal restrictions on allowing
outsider access. (That could be smokescreening.)
The report urges that Defense and Intel be given
ready access to whatever information will assist
their urgent task.
One of the legal advisors to the task force was Stewart
Baker, but there were several dozen industry and governmental
Here's a policy snippet:
"Following the end of the Cold War, and the subsequent changes in the geopolitical climate, the United States now faces a different kind of threat. This threat is characterized by the ability of numerous potential adversaries to engage in an information attack upon the United States, enabled by the lower entry costs associated with such an attack. America's ability to attribute and respond is woefully inadequate to pose a significant deterrent to would be attackers. On the other end of the spectrum, early tactical indications and warning capabilities are virtually non-existent in cyberspace. These factors converge to create a newly and differently vulnerable U.S. homeland.
It is the contention of the task force that immediate actions can work to decrease the threat and potential damage to U.S. national security, including infrastructures, institutions and individuals. The United States national security apparatus must continue to evolve over time to deal with these emerging trans-national threats, including trans-boundary threats where the differences between law enforcement and national defense, between foreign and domestic, between national and transnational, and between government and civilian are increasingly irrelevant."

Again, you are not the target of my spillover anger about the Bell lynching. You got deeper into that tarpit than most of us, having now been yanked into court twice for Jim and CJ. Better luck next time being newsworthy -- aint that better

60 Minutes said Shithead Tanner would not allow an interview with Bell until after the sentencing. I wonder if Mike Wallace
will contemn the USA/court shenanigans with a deep and full report, not just toy with Jim as a homeboy-terrorist.

In response to complaints the defendant has made to

We've put up some 80 court filings in the Bell case,
hyperlinked to the August 25 docket cited here yesterday:
   Recall that Judge Tanner sealed all the public
files that were available when he learned one of
the filings provided names of the jury pool and names
of jurors selected for the trial. The court's online files
were removed. He subsequently unsealed most
of the files (except 7 which remain sealed) but
the pre-trial filings have not been restored to the court's web site. Now only post-trial filings are available there.
Our offering is for the whole kaboodle that appeared
on the court's site from day 1, starting with the complaint from November 2000 through the sentencing order of August 24, 2001.
The files are in the multi-image TIFF format used
by the WWA court (and a number of other courts). The files can be viewed by a multi-image viewer such as Kodak's Imaging for Windows (included with
W98 et seq), Quick Time, Graph Works (a shareware), and others.

According to the IRS manual she's working with associates here ricocheting bank shots, though the associates may be her other shiteating nyms.

True, to a point. What constitutes an act appears to be
going through a dramatic redefinition in cybercrime and
allegedly terrorist-related actions.
An overt act is not the same for everyone; authorities
commit acts (crimes) that the rest of us cannot.
And according to the IRS investigation manual it is
fair game: to encourage such blurred-line-crossing actions,
even taking part in them to vet the promoter; to lie and
deceive to get the actions underway; to lie in court to conceal how it was done and who promoted the actions.
In the light that another reported has been subpoenaed for
notes it worth pondering if, as in the case of Bell and CJ,
journalists played a role in promoting line-crossing
behavior, not by doing the job they are known to do, but
by redefinition of the blurred line between reporting and
Neither Bell nor CJ would have been sent to prison without
the complicity of the media, witting or unwitting, and in my
opinion, witting moreso. Same goes for this list, which is
for me, a member of the media, and no doubt a member of
other conclaves yet to be revealed in court and to be sure
the hypermedia -- that is the media in which there is a
very blurred line (maybe none at all) between the authorities and the traditional media.
Look, this swipe is not about Declan and the guy at Bell's
trial. That is far too simple. What it is about is not taking for
granted avowals of innocence of trusted third parties no
matter what cloak they wear, for those TTP cloaks are now
clearly being used to entrap gullible actors. And any of
the TTPs who say this is paranoid have got a problem
of credibility derived primarily from the overly-concerted
effort to protect their own privilege even as they shop
their subjects as mere news, not quite getting the full
story right due to a blinding reliance on voices (grammar,
syntax, coherency, narrative) of authority which sound just like the authorities -- ducks quacking like ducks.
To not blindly tar everyone with this, I concede that those who have overtly proven they are trustworthy and continue to do so overtly, that is in public under fire, deserve a
chance on trust on short-terms. Talk about deserving trust
from any previleged position is just authoritarian talk.
And citing how many of your fellows have been thrown in
jail or suffered for their role aint worth shit unless you are
one of them. Then your talk aint all quack.

But he also kisses Leen (says Leen threatened to kill him two days before), London, Tanner, cpunk Jeff, another J and wife B, CIA's Bend OR Phantom, a phantom Phantom, The Super-Dirty Narc, Innocent Victim Agent No. 2, the Laura Raider of his mother's fireplace ashes, a police-asslick Reporter, and ... what can be said of Jim that he can't yodel better on the stand.
Tanner admonished London for leaving the podium
during questioning to get docs. "Stop it."
London apologized for asking Jim too many
questions without waiting for answers. "I'll stop
Leen asked to be relieved as defense attorney, Tanner: "Denied. Leen asked for a psycho exam of Jim, Tanner denied.
Jim tried to invoke his 5th Amendment rights,
Tanner denied: "answer the question."
Jim asked for legal representation, crying IANAL,
Tanner denied: "answer."
Jim admitted he stole mail and opened it, and burned
it in his mother's fireplace. Jim admitted he sent a
fax across state lines, and went across state lines
in pursuit of homebases of official pukes.
London affirmed all Jim's prison phone calls were

it was Jim who said the latter when he testified that
that posting to cpunks was how he notified the opukes what he intended.

Whatever promise AP has for its avowed purpose, so far it
has helped to jail a couple of guys and smear a few more

Talking about AP in public is still going on, here and elsewhere.
Disagreeing about it too. Take it seriously or as a joke, take
your pick. Nothing in the essay proves it's serious or a joke.
Its quality appears to be determined by the credulity of the
reader. I like its jokey aspects more than the other. But that's my feeling
about this forum too. The thrill continues, trying to figure out
who is serious and how is joking and who is laying the traps. The more serious posts here are the best, but mattd is coming
on swell for a standoff comic. True that not everyone likes the humor of political agitation,
and prefer a somber aping of the pols and mils and edus
flogging non-fictional aspirations to right what's wrong,
delusional ravings presented as insight.
Jim Bell would have made AP an underground comedy if he
had hung out with the time-wasterists at MIT rather than with
the techno-commercialists. But I think his techno-political
potboiler succeeds by making a comical wrong turn into the
pokey, not once but twice, and inspiring CJ to follow,

gains momentum. A lesson to be learned by the politico-religio-righteous.

Microsoft's patent for a Digital Rights Management
Operating System was awarded yesterday:
  A digital rights management operating system protects rights-managed data, such as downloaded content, from access by untrusted programs while the data is loaded into memory or on a page file as a result of the execution of a trusted application that accesses the memory. To protect the rights-managed data resident in memory, the digital rights management operating system refuses to load an untrusted program into memory while the trusted application is executing or removes the data from memory before loading the untrusted program. If the untrusted program executes at the operating system level, such as a debugger, the digital rights management operating system renounces a trusted identity created for it by the computer processor when the computer was booted. To protect the rights-managed data on the page file, the digital rights management operating system prohibits raw access to the page file, or erases the data from the page file before allowing such access. Alternatively, the digital rights management operating system can encrypt the rights-managed data prior to writing it to the page file. The digital rights management operating system also limits the functions the user can perform on the rights-managed data and the trusted application, and can provide a trusted clock used in place of the standard computer clock.

What is peculiar is that the non-bin Laden parts of the tape
are superior quality, with close up zooms and other adjustments
for quality. The portions which show UBL are consistently poorer
than the rest, and show little adjustment for quality. Hard to know
if that difference is in the original or was due to later doctoring.
Any video wizards to comment on the likelihood of different
video operators or was it tape from two different machines
spliced together?
Eric Margolis, a reporter and commentator just now on Wolf Blitzer's CNN show pointed out that the tape allegedly came from the Northern Alliance, that the Alliance is very close to Russian intelligence, and that the Russians are masters at forging documents and evidence of all sorts.
Margolis went on to say that every good reporter is suspicious
of "Christmas gifts" like the tape which appear at just the
right time in a convenient finding place.
Blitzer's other two guests, a Saudi representative, and a
reporter for the LA Times, were not suspicious of the tape.
Me, I agree with our Cherry Tree President that no patriot not a pedophile or an African-American on death row in Texas, would ever doubt the tape's authenticity. However, I deeply respect that the Prez crossed his eyes while lisping
the raspberry. Crossed more than usual. And the smirk
of the Prez when he talks about beheading bin Laden is
right out of the video. The smirk that never goes away
on preppy visages.

Also, it is peculiar that almost nobody in the tape
looked at the camera, which is hard to do unless
trained to do so like actors are, or such looks were removed by editing.
It is also possible that the tape was made surreptitiously,
though the differing camera angles would have to be
done by separate cameras.
Bin Laden's bulk appears to change in different shots.
front about the same stringbean. The side shot might
have been due to distortion -- it was closer in than
the frontal.
If the tape is legitmate, I'd say it probably was made
to boost the reputation of the Saudi sheik sitting to
bin Laden's left. He is the second-most person featured.
Could be bin Laden made an appearance and agreed
to the tape for promotion of the Sheik's agenda. Perhaps
bin Laden was on a tour himself of a batch of sheiks
arranged in adjoining rooms, anointing each, maybe
even doing a fund-raiser like our photo-addicted pols.
Certainly UBL was behaving identically to politicians
out working the crowd, bragging, kidding, kissing,
pretending to love the audience, acting as though
all of it is not for video outreach. True, politicians
send in cut-outs and UBL could have sent his
double of which he must have several.

NONCOMPLIANCE SUMMARY
The probation officer believes that Carl Edward Johnson has violated conditions of supervision by:
Violation Number      Nature of Noncompliance
  1.        Failing to report the names and addresses of two             Internet service providers, in violation of a             special condition of supervision.
  2.        Using the Internet to access the "Cypherpunk"             website after being specifically instructed not             to use the Internet for this purpose, in violation             of standard condition number 3.
U.S. Probation Officer Action; On October 18, 2001, this officer received intelligence
information which indicated Mr. Johnson was accessing the Internet using two Internet accounts which had not been provided to this officer. Mr.Johnson was using these accounts to insert himself back into a "Cypherpunk" web site he had been accessing during the instant offense. During the probation intake with Mr. Johnson on August 20, 2001, he was instructed to use the Internet for the purpose of researching his medical condition and legal matters only, He was specifically instructed not to access
the Cypherpunk website.
Of particular concern was the content of Mr. Johnson's e-mails, which contained derogatory comments about federal officials. On October 22, 2001, this officer, along with the investigating agent in this matter, conducted an unannounced home visit at Mr. Johnson's residence. Mr. Johnson was asked if he had
provided this officer with all Internet accounts he was currently using, to which he stated he had two new accounts he forgot to report to this officer. He accurately provided the account addresses and stated he would not forget in the future. Mr. Johnson was questioned in regard to his recent postings to the Cypherpunk website after being instructed by this officer not to use the Internet for this purpose. Mr. Johnson became highly agitated at this point, yelling obscenities and banging his fists on the table. After he calmed down, however, Mr. Johnson stated he misunderstood and did not realize he was restricted from going into this site. He further explained that his messages, in regard to federal officials, were simply commentaries to other people's messages. Mr. Johnson was reprimanded for the inappropriate nature
of his e-mail messages and again specifically directed not to access the Cypherpunk website or make any postings to that site. It is noted that a thorough inspection of Mr. Johnson's residence was conducted during this home visit which did not yield anything The Probation Office is giving Mr. Johnson the benefit of the doubt when he says he misunderstood this officer's instructions. We will continue to monitor him closely, and are recommending that no further action be taken at this time. Should Mr. Johnson's noncompliant behavior continue, the Court will be immediately notified and further sanctions will be requested.
                                     Respectfuly submitted,

I can see the spite value, but what harm could possibly
come from posting to cypherpunks as distinguished from
another mail list? Or does the ban include posting to
any mail list.
I read the prohibition against using the Internet for any

The report a while back in the NY Times on the secret
CIA station located in 7 World Trade Center, claimed
its primary role was to surveil UN members and staff.
And its cover was the Secret Service office in the
building (which also housed NYC's Emergency
Couple of things on that. The building, which was only
a few years old, is reported to have collapsed due to
high heat of oil storage tanks, a small tank on the upper
floor to serve NYC Emergency Operations, and an
unsually large tank in the basement. The building owner,
Larry Silverstein, who leased the WTC towers, says
the basement tank was for emergency power. Period.
However, while many buildings have emergency power
systems, few have the size of tanks in 7 WTC. Which may
indicate that the building housed a variety of operations
needing uninterruptable power, and which, in turn, could
explain why NYC put its emergency operations center
there despite public ridicule for putting it on a high floor,
of a glass walled building, next to a likely terrorist
Moreover, it is unlikely that the purpose of the CIA station
was only that made public to the Times. More likely is
that the public story is a cover for what the station did.
One possibility is that it engaged in communication
interceptions, if not transmissions to agents as well, and could have made use of the antennas atop WTC 1, or antennas cloaked by the public antennas.
Now whether bin Laden, or whoever planned the attack,
knew of this, or suspected it, could enrich the speculation
about why the towers were targeted.
Certainly it would take no comsec genius to perform
analysis of what was coming and going atop the towers,
or that may have been going on under cover of the
tower's emissions. All the public emissions could have
been discounted and the remainder subject to detailed
Perhaps the ordinary mujahadeen couldn't do that kind
of analysis but certainly a slew of other nations could.
As well as private comsec companies, of which there
are dozens in NYC peddling their services to US and
foreign clients.
So, if the CIA was surveilling these private security
companies, along with the comms of the UN members,
it may well be that countersurveillance picked up the
snoops and the information was peddled to assassins
or used to justify engaging hit squads to take out the
Finally, oil storage tanks are required by building and
fire codes to have especially durable fire-proofed enclosures,
the design based on the size of the tank and any expected
worse case scenario. At least this is the case when a
facility is subject to municipal regulations. Which we know the WTC was not. Whether the Center's unusual
vulnerability attacted the attack is a fair question.
But don't expect any findings to be made public is this
is the case, for that might require delving into which
operations in the Center invited retaliation by those
who had been attacked by them.

References: <3C1FE178.1050701
SSSCA is far from dead, it may have a good chance
of enactment according to Mike Godwin's essay today,
"Coming Soon: Hollywood Versus the Internet:"
  Here are his opening paragraphs:
"If you have a fast computer and a fast connection to the Internet, you make Hollywood nervous. And Tinseltown is nervous not because of what you're doing now, but because of what you *might* do -- grab digital Hollywood content
with your computer and broadcast it over the Internet.
Which is why Hollywood, along with other content companies, from book publishers to the music industry, has begun a
campaign to stop you from ever being able to do such a thing -- even though you may have no intention of becoming a copyright "pirate." That campaign has pitted corporate giants like Disney and Fox against corporate giants like Microsoft and IBM, but the resulting war over the shape of future digital technology may end up with us computer
users suffering the "collateral damage."
As music-software designer and entrepreneur Selene Makarios puts it, this campaign represents "little less than an attempt to outlaw general-purpose computers."
Let's get one thing straight -- when I say there's war looming in cyberspace over copyright, I'm not talking about the struggle between copyright holders and copyright "pirates" who distribute unlicensed copies of creative works for free over the Internet. Maybe you loved Napster or maybe you hated it, but the right to start a Napster, or to infringe copyright and get away with it, is not what's at issue here. And in a sense it's a distraction from what the real war is.
What I'm talking about instead is the war between the content industries (call them "the Content Faction") and the information-technology industries -- call the latter "the Tech Faction." That faction includes not only computer makers, software makers, and related digital-device manufacturers (think CD burners and MP3 players and Cisco routers). Allied with the Content Faction are the consumer-electronics makers -- the folks who build your VCRs and DVD players and boomboxes. The Tech Faction, which makes smarter, more programmabale devices and technologies than the consumer-electronics guys do, may count among their allies many cable companies and even telephone companies.
But what's the "collateral damage," exactly? Perhaps the most likely scenario is this: at some near-future date - perhaps as early as 2010 - individuals may no longer be able to do the kinds of things they routinely do with their digital tools in 2001. They may no longer be able, for example, to move music
or video files around easily from one of their computers to another (even if the other is just a few feet away in the same house), or to personal digital assistants. Their music collections, reduced to MP3s, may be moveable to a limited extent; unless their digital hardware doesn't allow it. The digital videos they shot in 1999 may be unplayable on their desktop and laptop computers -- or even on other devices -- in 2009.
And if they're programmers, trying to come up with the next great version of the Linux operating system, for example, they may find their development efforts put them at risk of criminal and civil penalties if the tools they develop are inadequately protective of copyright interests. Indeed, their
sons and daughters in grade-school computer classes may face similar risks, if the broadest of the changes now being proposed becomes law."

I think Mike is trying to describe the worst case scenario to
arouse opposition. Bear in mind that the Content Faction
(and maybe the Tech Faction) want to control the world,
not just the US. All countries are targets for SSSCA and
DMCA through copyright treaties and other control
Just a few days ago the last country needed to enforce
the WIPO Copyright Treaty signed on. WIPO is the global
version of DMCA. And the Hague Convention is meeting
shortly to set up the legal framework to enforce the
various global treaties on protecting intellectual property.
Sure, there will continue to be gray and black markets
in software but criminalization of circumvention devices
will put some youngsters (and oldsters) in jail, as we see looming from the recent warez raids.
I'm optimistic that Mike is too pessimistic but he knows
how to arouse by avoiding rosy ending scripts. The MPAA
and co-conspirators are dirty fighters and nobody should
expect to merely ignore them, thinking that loosening of
crypto controls is a model. They know that precedent and
are determined to do what governments could not.
Question is, as ever, what about the programmers within
the factions who are needed to carry out the wishes of the
bosses. In this, crypto could be a bellweather, for showing
how the technicians learned to outwit the others. But are
technical folks more susceptible these days to bribery
of swell life styles than the crypto-rebels were? Or better,
are there well-endowed, smarter than most, Factioners who do not want to be part of hegemonic putridity?
We'll see what the Factions offer the liberators to keep
them hard at work, happy to be protected intellectual property
slaves. None of whom would waste a second here
except to pick up intelligence for blowing upholes.

So far nothing about the Reid incident distinguishes it

Whether Reid was informed of his role by the operation
planners could be questioned.
And whether the planners were "terrorists" or the counter-
terrorism industry is a fair question.
Time magazine says in its December 31 edition:
  "White House aides tell Time they are envisioning a war   against terrorism that could last 50 years. As a model for   fashioning a long-term game plan, Bush aides have been   looking at old cold-war national-security doucments, such   as NSC-68, a plan the Truman Administration drafted in   1950 to contain the Soviets."

The next major attack will not likely involve civilian aircraft; that target has been effectively crippled, wounded not killed
so that  resources must be squandered to care for it.
More likely will be a target (or targets) which provides a sense of security and does not appear to be a source of danger and fear. Where there are few protections in place, and
where the shock of attack will be maximized, not just
in casualities but in its unexpectedness.
The attack should have the effect on Western culture,
say, that bombing of Mecca would have on Islam. That is,
it should be so violently audacious that long-standing
presumptions that the enemy would never do such a
thing are overwhelmed.
Under this scenario attack by weapons of mass destruction are not likely because of the overplay of their possible use.
What then would be such an attack, least expected and
most likely to be unprotected against?
Most likely is a widely distributed attack, perhaps simultaneous
but best to be staggered or unpredictable in time and how
extensive the attack is and what all its targets are. With
unpredictable pauses in the campaign, a combination of
rapid fire hits, pauses, seeming cessation, then a hit or
two, weird and shocking concordances and discordances
with other events, violations and cruelties beyond conventional
belief, beyond reason and madness.
A clue to understanding what an attack like this would be is
to imagine what would cause battle shock in the citizenry,
not terror and flight, but incapacitation of the mind and body
to function without physically harming most of the victims.
One likely cause of this breakdown is lack of information
about what is going on and what will happen next, where danger
lies and when will violence against loved ones and self occur
next. Dread of the unknown after initial evidence that horror
is sure to come, and is inexcapable no matter what measures
have been taken to prevent it.
By now it is clear that this is what the US military did in Afghanistan, and what is most likely to be done to the US
and its allies in vengeful payback, if not soon then eventually.
Calling in F-15s to combat shoes containing explosives shows
how Western military forces helplessly misgauge its enemies. So,
too, does declaring the US has won in Afghanistan when it has not
engaged the enemy, and when it has repeatedly failed to protect its forces, its embassies and its cities from asymmetric attack.
The US and its allies is fiercest in engaging in propaganda,
ably assisted by commercial propagandists, the news media.
Beheading the centers of information warfare would be the end of Western culture.

There are a relative few choke points for information distribution
in the West. Not all would have to be taken out at the same time,
only a few, then a pause to process intelligence garnered from
the second attack along with that of the first was on the WTC and Pentagon (the anthrax attack provided intelligence for the same planners whether done by them or planned for a later intel-gathering operation).
The short-lived patriotism after WTC/Pentagon has been
transformed into uncritical jingoism in the US and surprisingly
in the copycat UK.
There has been a stead build-up of intelligence by fire from
the various bombings of US installations leading up to WYC
and the Pentagon, as several military and intellgience analysts have noted. And still the US and its allies have not been able
to halt the attacks, despite round-up of a few low level operatives
and convictions -- but no public execution or other merciless
acts of retribution, or none that have been publicized.
The Afghan bombing has been exhibited as relatively bloodless
except for the killing of journalists and a single CIA officer --
agents of information which have become the pariahs of
many societies, not all of them non-Western.
What would have an effect in the West is not only attacks on
the infrastructure of information and its celebrated leaders
but its variety of participants -- students, teachers, preachers,
educators, journalists, publicists, ad writers, entertainers,
intellectual property creators and producers and exporters,
lawyers and a slew of professionals. These are the sources
of the offensive content and the tools, hardware, and weapons
that accompany the content, that drive opponents to murderous
rage in defense of their own cultural content.
The Western conceit that its culture is so superior that it
must impose it on others through missionary campaigns
now many centuries old, through economic policies, through eduation, through foreign policies, through military enforcement,
and through disparagement of other cultures, has bred a
deep seated anger toward the prime exporters, the idea
supremacists of state, church and family.
Despite tolerant pretensions, the West has been the bloodiest
culture that ever existed, and is getting meaner and more
vicious as its technological prowess grows and its intellectual
abilities decline -- as with all powerful bandits which get more
stupid as they conquer by force.
The US superpower vainglory is what keeps it ever blind to
the weakness of its power: it's obessession with secrecy
and belief that hardware will prevail over software, those
standard signs of power corruption preceding a fall.
All power aggrandizement thrives on cloaking its predations
with claims of superiority -- state, church and family -- and
refusal to consider that it is not as good as it dreams of
being, that is, the powerful take promotional material for Empires are susceptible to having their illusions shattered
when their cosmeticians lose their skill at concealing the
rot. Or to put it another way, when long successful cosmetic
schemes lose their power to deceive.
The US military is a shell of an effective military operation,
sustained more by publicity than by successful action. It
has had no enemy to test its promise since WW2 when it
gained a foothold in US culture through citizen military
service and luxurious payoffs to industry and education,
especially education and training for advancing Western culture through economic, political and social exports.
Targets for centers of these exports are not hard to
identify, and they are not nuclear plants, bridges,
water supplies, and digital infrastructure, probably not
even Washington DC icons of political power -- these
are propounded as in urgent need of protection to divert
attention from crucial nodes.
Again, to see which are juicy targets for undermining
Western culture, look to those hardly protected at
all except by obscurity, by never being mentioned as
needing protection, by never promoted as ideas, places and people of influence, by being those supporters of Western
culture which are so fundamental to it the culture would
not be identifiable without them.
These targets are not celebrated, they are taken for
granted as if to last forever, well, as long as King George
lasted on the American continent (his reign did not end
with the American revolution but went overground into
our most distinguished institutions of rank, privilege, elitism, secrecy, deceit and conceit).

The dominant religion of the West is Middle Eastern in
origin, its best features long overlayered with barbaric bureaucracy of the Greeks and Latins and vile practices derived from the warrior cultures, many the outgrowth of northern European hinterlands, Anglo-Saxon defectives
still enthralled with ceremonial violence inherent in
costume, sports, entertainment, prejudice, pride, and
exculpation of ego-driven indifference to harm caused
others -- others deliberately defined as unworthy of
equal treatment with those who considered themselves
inherently superior. Calvinism a cloak for screwing
with mammon's blessing.
The dominant political system is similarly derived and
corrupted by bandit mentality, warlords changing sides,
imitating each other, destroying dissenters of the main
behavior, bribing those they cannot beat, stigmatizing
and/or criminalizing those they cannot bribe.
The Western family culture is probably the most barbaric of
all for its promulgation of vicious sexual peculiarities, prohibitions, askanced violations, intra-familial deceits, institutionalized sanctimoniousness and manipulation
and slavery (oft through faux idolization) of children and women. The dominant male is homosexual beyond the
conventional definition of that term, preferring and
adoring other males, the more dominating the better,
though never recognizing the fundamental cowardice
of preening dominants -- all showboating, parading,

9 February 2001, 2:35 PM EST. Cryptome has just received word that the British government is telling UK newspapers that an arrangement has been reached with Cryptome's ISP, Verio, to yank "Enquiry: The Killing Years in Ireland":   We have not heard from Verio, and the file remains available. The British government is threatening to injunct any UK publisher intending to reveal information in the file which
was received from an anonymous source and names a
controversial intelligence agent runner in Northern Ireland. The named officer is the center of a major investigation
of orchestrated murders assisted by British intel.
The Brits are telling newspapers that publication on Cryptome
does not mean the information is widely available, thus justifying
British publication.
Cryptome will not remove the file except in response to a US court order because it is our belief that nothing in the file is illegal under US law.

Twice since my grand jury appearance I've been contacted
by persons claiming to be journalists for comment on Jim
Bell's case.
I referred them to Cryptome for the best representation
of my views. Both resisted that, claiming they wanted to hear
from me personally.
What is striking is the similarity of their questions to those asked
during the grand jury appearance by Robb London and by
jury members, in particular my view of "anti-government activity,"
stalking of federal officials, and Assassination Politics, as well
as why AP was on Cryptome.
I explained to both callers that due to the possibility my grand
jury testimony may be used against me it was prudent for me to
refer them to files on Cryptome, and when it became available, the
testimony transcript. That I did not want to go beyond what was already publicly available.
Neither caller was satisfied with that, and persisted in asking
leading questions about AP and anti-government activities.
They also asked who else could they talk to about these
I said there was nobody I could suggest to talk to; that AP was a provocative exploration of digital technologies but not at all
lethal; and that I was not anti-government but opposed to government abuse of power and its excessive secrecy. That I did not advocate violence against public officials, though insults, ridicule, disrespect for their career ambitions were duties of the conscientious citizen.
Now that the feds have subpoenaed me for the trial and have refused to provide a transcript of my grand jury testimony, it seems to me that the feds are behaving characteristically
treacherously (as others have warned), and are likely to have used "journalists" to get me to incriminate myself and/or to name other targets for investigation or subpoenas.
So in case others are being queried for stories here are the names and affiliations of the "journalists" who called and would not take my referral to Cryptome for an answer.

A furnace makes heat, a boiler makes steam or hot water. Many small buildings have a boiler that does
all three by combing components in a single unit.
Large buildings have three separate units, and more
for specialized tasks.
In New York City, there is an important distinction between
cellar and basement. Cellars are not habitable while
basements are. The building code definition of a basement is that at least half its height is above street level, and that
of cellar is that just over half its height is below street
level. Many residential buildings are designed to
take advantage of that distinction. The rule covers
sloping site conditions to average the difference between
front and back.
The basement level is often called the Ground Floor to
take away any stigma associated with basement.
Much mechanical and electrical equipment is located in
the cellar to maximize habitable space above. Same goes
for the roof.
Terrific expenditures for excavating multi-level cellars are
the norm for high-rise buildings -- even in hard rock as in
Manhattan -- to produce maximum habitable space allowed
under the zoning code, which, in combination with building
health, and environmental codes, regulates bulk, height, light,
air, room sizes, window sizes and a host of requirements
for barely tolerable human habitation -- and legal standards
are ever dropping in squalid, squirming cities for luxury as
well as dirt cheap holes.
We architects are expected to, well, cheat, to maximize what
property owners want at the expense of building inhabitants
and the inccreasingly squeezed and violated public. What helps us get away with cheating is massive PR by our professional flacks, sophisticated aesthetic and environmental theories that claim wretched architecture is beautiful, drunken orgies with regulatory officials, revolving door participation in standards committees and holding
public office -- to be sure, as practised by all professions, in particular those that are solemnly licensed and sworn
to protect the public from people like us.
Occasionally an idiot architect, like this one, tries to go against
the grain, and work dries up instantly and family says dont
be stupid, dont shame us. Then back to doing what church and family command to be an outstanding citizen/bandit.
Social planning is a useful deception, twinned with the free market -- the two backed beast.

The agents asked no questions except to verify my identity. The principal agent, Mr. Jack, referred me to Special  Agent Jeff Gordon for questions if I had any, and presented a note with Jeff's name, title, Treasury office, and phone number.
Mr. Jack said they knew nothing about the case and were only serving the subpoena. I asked for Mr. McWhirr's name, borrowed
his pen to jot both names -- neither had cards, only badges to
show. Mr. Jack said they were with Treasury Inspector
General for Tax Adminstration (TIGTA), as is Jeff.
The date of the subpoena is December 27, 2000, and was
faxed to New York at 8:36 AM today. The subpoena states in bold caps "We request that you do not disclose the existence of this subpoena, because such a disclosure may make it more difficult to conduct the investigation."
The subpoena is one page, with two pages of attachments,
one titled "Information for Grand Jury Witnesses," the other
a description of arrangements for reimbursement of

NY Times has a story today about the offshores being pressured
by the big nations to curtail tax evasion and avoidance. The islands
first resisted assaults on their sovereignty, but have agreed to
do a study of the issue.
On a related matter is the likelihood of nations and private interests
engaging in cyberwar over who controls financial and perhaps
intellectual property resources. Steve Levy last evening said he believes cyberwar is soon to come, and cryptography will play
a crucial role, but he said this would be between nations, whereas it is probably more likely that nations, utilizing their combined intelligence and law enforement agencies, will combat private interests not each other, in particular those parties attempting to run financial transactions outside government control.
The nations argue they must unite to protect their citizenry
against criminal businesses and outlaws, the othe side argues
the need to protect government invasion of private affairs.
What is lacking in Levy's CRYPTO is that it does not appear to consider that multiple governments will collude against their
citizenry, rather than each doing so. Steve at one point cited cypherpunks as a hopeless
venture to overturn government with ideas of cryptoanarchy. And laughed at that. Then continued
propounding the false idea that NSA is needed
to protect US interests. Not a word about such interest
being those of the USG.

One of the Tempest FOIA docs NSA released recently concerns NONSTOP, a term whose definition is classified
as SECRET. About half of the document, NACSEM 5112, "NONSTOP Evaluation  Techniques," has been redacted,
and we'll publish it soon.
protection against compromising emanations of cryptographic systems, and maybe in particular radio crypto systems.
Another document refers to NONSTOP testing and protection
being especially needed on vehicles, planes and ships.
We've been unable to retrieve more than a few words from
the redacted portions (by use of xerography to reveal text below the overwrites), and would appreciate any leads on what NONSTOP means. Joel McNamara has been searching
for NONSTOP info for some time:    We would also like to learn more about covert surveillance
by "resonance" technology. Peter Wright, in Spycatcher,
provides most interesting anecdotes about this. He writes
of remotely "radiating" specially-designed objects in a space to pick up signals, and tells of several covert operations
in which MI5 used this method.
Wright also describes the use of supersensitive microphones
to pick up the daily setting of rotors on cryptomachines of the time, in particular the Hagelins made by CryptoAG.
This loops back to NONSTOP and the question of what may be the signatures and compromising emanations of today's cryptosystems which reveal information in ways that go beyond known sniffers -- indeed, that known sniffers may divertingly camouflage. Along this line I mention for the nth time that the National Academy
of Science 1996 CRYPTO report, which advocated loosening crypto controls, also recommended increased funding for other surveillance technologies that have never been identified, although Carnivore may be one such, along with keyboard sniffers and who knows what else that has been passed to domestic law enforcement by the intelligence agencies to crack crypto protection.

Joel McNamara first told me about NONSTOP and its commonly
associated classified codeword, HIJACK, both somehow related
to Tempest. When you do a search on either of them you get hundreds (or 1000s) of hits for the generic terms "non-stop" and "hi-jack" but few entries for the codewords, and then as standards in military security documents. It's as if the codewords were picked to be camouflaged by the generics. And, because codewords are usually set to have
no relation to the protected material, they probably are not descriptive -- but could be, just to outfox off the smarties.
The NONSTOP doc released to us was first issued in 1975 and has gone through 4 reprintings, the latest in 1987. And it continues to be cited as still in effect, though usually such standards are updated at least every 5 years. So there may
be a later one which would account for the partial release
after first denial.
It's intriguing to read Spycatcher (1987) while reading the Tempest docs. I had not read Wright's most informative
book, and regret not having done so.
For those who have not read it, Peter Wright was MI5's
first scientist, and entered the service after WW2. He
specialized in the technology of counterintelligence and
with a few others cooked up a host of ingenious means
to spy on spies and suspects. A specialty was the
extraordinary use of electromagnetic devices -- radio, telephone, acoustic, resonance, and more -- applying scientific abilities well in advance of technicians and engineers. Some of his ideas were so advanced his
bosses said impossible, until he proved effectiveness. Then Wright quickly became the savior of bureaucrats who could not understand why Britain's enemies kept outsmarting them -- usually with advanced technological means. Wright changed that, but often got at odds with non-scientifically trained personnel.
Among others, he worked closely with GCHQ on occasion to provide technical attacks on cryptosystems which could not be broken by cryptanalysis. Thus his research on the cryptosecrets revealed by compromising emanations from devices, cabling, furniture, construction materials, and a host
of ordinary physical objects -- all of which emitted signals that
could be acquired and interpreted by careful tuning for comprehension. He writes of amazing methods of acquiring signals, and it is no wonder HMG fought to prevent publication of Spycatcher.
What he did not write about must be even more wondrous, and it makes you think he could pick up your brain waves
if you were part of particular triangulated antenna.
Maybe NONSTOP and HIJACK have nothing to do with
the stuff Wright excelled at. Still, reading Spycatcher
along with the Tempest docs -- and now Stephen
Budiansky's "Battle of Wits: The Complete Story of
Codebreaking in World War II," (2000) -- certainly
demonstrates how much of codebreaking has been
done by covert technical and physical means, even
as we are told misleading cover stories.
Are the crypto-revelations also disinformation?
Historically all have been.  Ha, ha, ha.

   leaking onto a transmission line as a side channel used to break a
   French cryptographic device [Wri87].
   The (unclassified) military literature provides many examples of
   real-world side channels.  [...]  Peter Wright's crosstalk anecdote
   is probably what the HIJACK codeword refers to [USAF98]. Along
   similar lines, [USAF98] alludes to the possibility that crosstalk from
   sensitive hardware near a tape player might modulate the signal on the
   tape; [USAF98] recommends that tapes played in a classified facility be
   degaussed before they are removed, presumably to prevent side channels
   from leaking. Finally, one last example from the military literature
   is the NONSTOP attack [USAF98, Chapters 3-4]: after a careful reading
   of unclassified sources, we believe this refers to the side channel
   that results when cryptographic hardware is illuminated by a nearby
   radio transmitter (e.g. a cellphone), thereby modulating the return
   signal with information about what the crypto gear is doing [AK98].

The explosion left a significant dusting of powder
aboard weather deck surfaces and a residual smell
(like fetrilizer) on the mess decks as well as in other
areas, including the starboard passageway leading
to Sick Bay. Smoke curtains helped to contain the
smell. The crew did not remove the substance from
the weather decks (where personnel slept on account
of the heat) because the FBI had not arrived to take
samples for testing. 12 fatalities could not be extricated
initially due to structural damage in the galley and mess
areas. As the temperature exceeded 100 degrees

This morning I testified before a Grand Jury in
Western Washington District Court, Seattle, which
is investigating Jim Bell for interstate stalking
of federal officials. The testimony concerned what I knew about alleged CIA employee Mueller and Jim's alleged gathering of personsal information about this person.
I provided the Grand Jury my messages to cypherpunks
about this topic which are the only documents I had
to offer in response to the subpoena.
AUSA Robb London conducted most of the questioning,
with some questions from the jury.
Robb said I was not a target of an investigation but
my testimony and/or perjury could change that.
I will attempt to get a transcript of my testimony
and put it on Cryptome. Robb said that is doable
but it will take a judge's order to release. Robb said Jim is still in evaluation to determine his fitness to represent himself. A trial date will not be set until the evaluation is completed and the judge
Jeff Gordon was in the grand jury suite but did
not attend the hearing.

The point, hardhead, is to keep communications public.
Private stuff can be leveraged into a subpoena. Not your own private stuff, somebody else's. Like your CDR
I handed my subpoenaed material (public messages to cpunks and the HTML subpoena on Cryptome) to the grand
jury foreman after being told by London that it was an
informal procedure to give subpoenaed material to him
or Capt. Jeff Gordon, the "case's lead investigator." Robb
didn't know what was in the package during his questioning, nor did the grand jury.
I referred to the material several times to buttress my
testimony, and only near the end did Robb say, "are
you saying you only provided public information?" That's right, I answered. And I told him and Jeff beforehand I wanted to publish
my testimony, and told the jury I intended to report on the
process: To help the public understand how government
works, especially the secret part.
One juror said, you're not going to publish our names
are you? Robb hastened to testify, no way.
Anyway, this could be a pack of lies, and more filthy
secrets about how government works, and how you get
snared by artful bargains for personal protection and national security, on the jury and off, by folks who
preach that faith.
Which comes back to the CDR forehead mark. And
how you get pariahed by contact with the feds no matter what you do obey their commands or to wash away the dirt. They're addicted to that secret sadistic pleasure,
and aim to addict juries.

One point: Robb London kept referring to posts to cypherpunks
as if they were between individuals, say me and Jim Bell.
I had to point out that the messages were to the cypherpunks
list not between individuals. And that I had not sent mail to
Jim directly and that Jim's messages were not to me but to
a public list. That distinction may not have been absorbed
by the jury, especically if they had already been briefed

This confusion is caused by the way return messages are
addressed. In my Eurora mailer, if you just hit return to a cpunk message, the writer's address pops up, or it does in my configuration. To avoid that I have to manually add the cpunk address.
Moreover, responders often send two or more messages,
to the writer, to cpunks, and, in some cases, to previous

ISPs, telcomms, routers and so forth have been assigned a covert task
to sift for encryption using tools supplied by TLAs. NSA, for one, has
the ability to spot encrypted communications -- most if not all of them.

under law to acquire and retain indefinitely for future study no matter the source, even if the sources are otherwise proscribed communications of US persons. This is set forth in USSID18, the NSA guideline for electronic   As security wizards have long noted, if you use encrypted communications
anywhere in the world you will be intercepted, stored and studied. That the global ISPs may be lending a hand with this should be no surprise, for that would be continuing the long history of commercial communications companies providing covert help to those who regulate them -- despite promises to customers of confidentiality (and the banks as well).
The legal departments of ISPs are the principal means by which covert

primary crime is commercial gain? That he is claimed
to be the copyright holder is thin stuff, for that does not
support his being the main commercial beneficiary (unless the FBI has evidence that was not revealed about Elcomsoft's
internal finances).
To be sure some of the officers of ElcomSoft have ties
to the KGB and the FBI and the CIA are customers of the
firm, as likely are other countries' TLAs.
That Dmitry was busted has a stench of scapegoatism,
and ElcomSoft may not be altogether innocent, not least
for sending Dmitry into the lion's den.
Read the statements made by ElcomSoft officers carefully
about prior appearances at conferences outside of Russia.
Protestations claiming the officers had no idea a bust was
in the offing are a bit much.
It may well be that the Dmitry bust is a ploy whose purpose
will be revealed later as we learn more about cooperation
among the globe's law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
Would ElcomSoft shop Dmitry for closer ties with USG
customers with fat budgets for fighting cybercrime? Perhaps
not with initial intent to do so but could very well do so in
order to close a deal and better deals to come.
Ashcroft's talk about the new cybercrime initiative, and the

The NY Times reports today on a leering virus which searches
the Web for machines which might contain porno material,
real or imagined as the virus decides, and then the little shit fingers the machine to one of various law enforcement agencies in its database. (Excerpt below)
Anybody had this leerer rat their cave or know of a victim?
June 11, 2001 Virus Searches for Pornography
By Roy Furchgott
A new rogue computer program, possibly intended to perform a public service, has raised thorny legal questions and seems sure to fuel the debate over computer privacy.
The new virus, which is called VBS.Noped.a, searches the target's machine for what it suspects may be child pornography and reports the names of files to the police. There are no reports of police officials acting on such results, and antivirus
software companies say it has not yet been distributed widely and is at relatively low risk of damaging computers.
Technically a worm, the virus is of unknown origin and was spotted by computer security companies on May 22. It arrives as an attachment to an e-mail message titled, "FWD: Help us ALL to END ILLEGAL child porn NOW." When a recipient opens the attachment, child pornography statutes appear on screen. The
program then searches the user's hard drive for picture files that have pornographic-sounding names and then sends an e-mail message and a list of suspect files to a law enforcement agency picked at random from the program's database.
"Hi," the message sent to the police says: "This is Antipedo2001. I have found a PC with known child pornography files on the hard drive. I have included a listing below and included a sample for your convenience."
The virus also sends out copies of itself to addresses in the victim's e-mail address book.
Apart from the program's invasive nature, virus experts question the results the program sends out.
Its search software is apt to falsely identify files as containing child pornography, said Stephen Trilling, director of research at the Symantec Anti-Virus Research Center in Santa Monica, Calif., which suggests that the results could cause irreparable harm to run-of-the-mill computer owners if the results are acted upon.
While law enforcement agencies cannot search an individual's computer
without a warrant, they can act on a tip. The F.B.I., one of the agencies
on the Noped list, would not say if it had received tips from this virus
program. A Justice Department lawyer said that law enforcement
officials could legally conduct a search based on the tip, but added,
"That's a very different question from `would law enforcement ever
open an investigation based on that information?' "
Perhaps most troubling, legal experts say, is the havoc that the virus
could wreak on the reputation of people with no involvement in child pornography. "There is no telling how far this information might spread," said Stephen J. Davidson, a lawyer and spokesman for the Computer Law Association. Local news organizations could report that a parent was under investigation as a pedophile, he said, "all resulting from an unwarranted and illegal entry to your private

A tactic used by the anti-pedo vigilantes and narcs is to
covertly bury pedo porno amongst adult porno and then
finger the adult downloaders as pedophiles knowing the
evidence will be found without the downloaders knowing
it is there until discovered during a raid.
A federal case here in Manhattan got a conviction this way.
Or so I am told by the convict, who got a ten year sentence.
Cleanse your files, kiddie sluts.
And who saw the arousing report in Saturday's New York
Times about the practice of bestiality, yes, sex with
animals, that is now coming out of the closet. The last
taboo is getting its day. One gent goes on talk shows with his dog to tell what it's like.
Debate rages on whether it's rape if the animal does
not explicitly give consent. Some animal protection
advocates say that the lovemaking is okay with them, better to go all the way with animals rather than raise for killing and eating.
(No comparison of Swift's advocacy of raising Irish
children for food.)
Really, in the New York Times, descriptions of French
kissing your dog, and why not, since that is far more
sanitary than doing it with a human.
Someone suggested the article is just part of Hollywood's

@_subject: Thermal Imaging Decision Applicable to TEMPEST? 
The Supreme Court's decision against thermal imaging appears to be applicable to TEMPEST emissions from electronic devices.
And is it not a first against this most threatening vulnerability
in the digital age? And long overdue.
Remote acquisition of electronic emissions, say from outside a home, are not currently prohibited by law as far as I know. And
the language of the thermal imaging decision makes it applicable
to any technology not commonly in use.
Conventional wisdom of security wizards are that the emissions
are very difficult to acquire from more than a hundred yards or
so, but James Bamford claims in his recent "Body of Secrets" that
NSA was able to acquire leaky emissions from Russian crypto equipment 6 miles offshore Cuba in the 1960s. Advances in technology would presumbably increase that capability.

Yes, and the confusion between the two sometimes leads to
gaps in understanding as well as security. And I don't know the name
of the technology that acquires signals by "illumination" of objects
bouncing emissions -- some say it is all TEMPEST, others
say don't be fooled by that misnomer -- ther really good stuff is
several generations beyond what is know as TEMPEST. Maybe
that is what NONSTOP and HIJACK and other codewords refer
We have tried and failed to get NSA to open up more on its standards
for both types and blacker stuff. TEMPEST suppliers -- products and services -- have said that it's tough getting NSA to clarify what can be exported and what cannot by any means except by submitting products for review, waiting and getting back a yes or no, but not by getting precise requirements beforehand. Maybe that will change to follow the lead of crypto as demand for TEMPEST picks up.
Meanwhile it is probable that NSA is testing TEMPEST products
for blacker weaknesses, again like crypto, or rather the systems
and programs for crypto use.
We've been told by suppliers that the export market for TEMPEST (both
types) produce would blossom without restrictions on commercial/private use. Govs get approvals for the best stuff (unspecified mil grade) but not biz and citz. Don't know about banks and telecomms and drug-kingpins, maybe they get special treatment for allowing access to data and dope. Outrageous, sure, but it is reported to happen.
Still, as far as this amateur knows, there is no restriction on any type
of TEMPEST inside the US, so the standard of protection is victim And don't believe for a second anything you see in public about how far
away emissions can be acquired or how to protect against TEMPEST with
market-available products. Experts in the employ of the gov whisper you
won't see the truth about TEMPEST in public any time soon though there
will be a whole lot of smoke. The increasing smoke I can vouch for.
Even TSCM's and electronic PI's admit all the public stuff about TEMPEST standards is prefabricated sunshine. Though that might be a DIRT ploy to sell really, really, really totally reliable, better than mil-grade,

A third is signal analysis.
A principle argument against being able to sort through the geometric
increase in devices that leak emissions since the 1960s is that it is nearly impossible to find a pin in the hugely noisy haystack of the
electrogmagnetic spectrum.
Help me out here with signal analysis capability even with the niagara
of the digital age. Is it not possible to sort through a very large range
of signal using readily available algorithms to then pinpoint the
signature of types of sources, then home in on subsets of those
sources, to finally single out a particular source?
With the increase in signal volume has come a corresponding increase in signal analysis capability. Analysis of the full electromagnetic spectrum
has been possible for quite a while, if public documents on military research
are a reliable guide, and comprehensive analysis is ever being refined with
with increasingly fine granularity.
While there are billions of electronic devices leaking emissions, there
are no where near as many EM slots used by those devices and their
emissions. In fact, there are only a small number of public slots -- so long as devices conform to regulations. EM leakage is regulated as well.
If the world's devices conform to regulations, and those EM slots are
known and catalogued for signal analysis, then there is a question
about the leakage of the leakage, that is, emissions that escape
regulation, by poor device design, by granularity, or unintentionally.
The signature of a device which leaks, or makes noise, in a unique way is what presumably is searched for in sophisticated signal analysis. A few hundred submarines are identified this way, as are potentially
billions of people.
Are there too many unique device signatures to acquire and identify?
Perhaps so, but I suspect that enterprise is being diligently worked
on, beginning with data provided by manufacturers, catalogung
implanted emissive attributes in the devices, using benchmarks
for types of devices, tracking taggants and moles, cooking up
new variants on Hidden Markov and the host of search/sort/analyze/ID
Jumping off the cliff of ignorance, I suspect that signal analysis,
as with cryptanalysis, will be always able to find a way to get around obscurity. If you don't want to be acquired, don't signal.
Silencio, mafia.

@_subject: TIME.com: Nation -- Supreme Court: Relax. The Heat is Off 
Let me try again after reading Time's Q&A and the responding
attorney claiming that anything inside a home is protected but
nothing outside it is.
My question concerns the methodology of "illuminating" or
"radiating" an object, say, within a home, in order to acquire
signal that may be striking that object, say emissions from
an electronic device but not escaping to the outside under
there own momentum.
Peter Wright in "Spycatcher" describes use of this technology
to acquire signal from crypto machines, French as I recall.
There was discussion of this here a while back, in connection with the contraption concealed by the Soviets behind the great seal in the US Embassy in Moscow. Wright analyzed that contraption for the US to understand how it worked.
Wright is not altogether precise in describing the methodology
nor that of other counterintelligence tools he and others
invented, but some of them appear to be related to acoustic
analysis. (Wright and his father worked for Marconi which
specialized in producing classified comsec products for the UK
military and secret services.)
In any event, if a method is used to acquire signal *within*
a home, would that acquisition be forbidden by the thermal decision? That is, if a signal is sent into a home to acquire
an interior signal, is that a violation?
This may seem to be similar to a bug planted just outside the
face of an exterior wall of a home, or reading the vibrations of
window glass, but I'm trying to imagine an alternative technology
to these, perhaps one that remains classified.
BTW, there has been speculation that NONSTOP and/or HIJACK
are codewords for acoustic vulnerabilities of the sort I'm
fumbling with.
The reason I'm pursuing this is that I've been told we are not
asking NSA the right questions to be answered under FOIA,
that there is technology which has not been revealed in
public and whose names are secret. But we haven't been able to determine what to ask besides stuff usually associated with TEMPEST.

Debate on whether the NSA spies domestically on US persons appears to be "yes" according to USSID 18, dated July 23, 1993, which was obtained by the National Security Archive a while back, for which we offer an HTML:
  Parts previously redacted concerning domestic surveillance are now  revealed, among them these provisions for acquiring and retaining indefinitely domestically acquired encipherments:
(2) Domestic communications reasonably believed to contain technical data base information may be retained for a period sufficient to allow a thorough exploitation and to permit access to data that are, or are reasonably believed
likely to become, relevant to a current or future foreign intelligence requirement. Sufficient duration may vary with the nature of the exploitation.   (S-CCO)
a. In the context of a cryptanalytic effort, maintenance of technical data bases requires retention of all communications that are enciphered or reasonably believed to contain secret meaning, and sufficient duration may consist of any period of time during which encrypted material is subject to, or of use
in, cryptanalysis. (S-CCO)
b. In the case of communications that are not enciphered or otherwise thought to contain secret meaning, sufficient duration is one year unless the Deputy Director for Operations, NSA, determines in writing that retention for a longer period is required to respond to authorized foreign intelligence or counterintelligence requirements. (S-CCO)
[End quote]
Again, these sections were censored in versions of USSID 18
previously made public, a 1980 version here:
  While the quoted material is a small part of the 52-page
document, variations on it are repeated more than
once, and seems to be the one exception to the
requirement to avoid domestic interceptions and
to destroy any that are inadvertently acquired.
The classification (S-CCO) is not explained but some
think it perhaps indicates material limited to the UK/USA
agreement and/or the Echelon partners. A better answer
is welcomed.

A consequence of issuing subpoenas to news folks
is to inhibit their reporting on the trial, for witnesses are
excluded from the proceedings, at least before their
testimony -- I'm not sure about exclusion after testimony.
No doubt a rich publisher will assign a second reporter
to cover the trial. Which is what superrich Cryptome will do, as well as get daily transcripts, hopefully in digital form
for immediate publication -- even to be laptopped by those
excluded from the trial. Unless this public announcement

and so on.
Anybody know who the second subpoenaed reporter is?
Jeff answered the inquiry about my GJ transcript: "don't
get your hopes up. I've never heard of that happening,
instead only portions of GJ testimony are available if
introduced at the trial." That's not what Robb told me
before testifying, but then he's a mouther rather than
a shooter like Jeff.
Anybody who thinks questions posed during testimony will be limited to what was assured beforehand has got to be from Pluto. Same credulity for "off the record."
The feds will tell you anything to get your cooperation.
And leave to your imagination and planted news stories

to be able to more efficiently spy on its users, as with intelink,
siprnet and niprnet -- and our own beloved Internet whose
users and hackers know not what is being logged. Counterintelligence has become a more important function of the intel agencies than intelligence, as with corporations, educational institutions and families who face internal attacks.
Exposing threats to kids, church and nation is a hot market.
Counterintelligence in all its forms is riding high as a savior

Still there are dark sides to knowing the truth.
The reports of DNA evidence showing that up to 28% of fathers are not the biological fathers of children for whom they
are legal parents is a reminder that revisionist intelligence is not limited to the spooks as data mining becomes more widely available.
And what will come of government as it becomes more
subject to internal attacks due to greater access to snooping
technology and counter-snooping attempts to hold onto
the privilege of knowing what underlings do not?
Deutch thought he knew why it was wise to work at home, to avoid the counter-snoops watching him, but the counter-snoops knew what he did not -- they work for
themselves not the bosses.
Sys admins may well become the power mongerers of
the future, or is that already the case. Hayden is dreaming
if he thinks he will be able to watch his troops without their knowing and counteracting it.
What is worrisome is the prospect of a coup by the info hi-technoids, most of who work for the military or have contracts with them -- out contracts.
SAIC, BBN, Mitre, RAND, the telecomms, the satcomms,
operators of the thick connections worldwide, coupled
with the wizards at the NSA, NRO, USAF, DIA, and so,
could put on a formidable putsch, while the oversight
committees remain, as ever, three monkied.

"According to the American Association of Blood Banks,
280,000 paternity tests were conducted in 1999, three
times as many as a decade earliet. And in 28 percent of
the tests, the man tested was found not to be the father."
The article goes on to say that most courts still require
a non-biological-father to support the kids he once
believed were his own. To protect the kids.
This parallels law that favors bosses, property owners,
and high office holders over those they fuck, well maybe

Men usually got a hangup about paternity, and
many don't want to know the truth, so the 28% is
surely way low, in particular to protect the kids and
the wives and to keep the men in harness. Them's the facts of biology and culture and healthy
workplace economies.

@_subject: Screwing Jim Bell Royally 
The feds, after refusing for months to allow Jim Bell's host of motions to be filed, are now allowing them in a rush, well short of the required minimum of a month to allow trial preparation. The motions are available on the Court's web site, in TIF format, and we'll have them up in HTML/TXT this weekend.
The motions show that since mid-December Jim has repeatedly asked for adequate legal representation and been repeatedly refused. In fact, almost all his motions have been denied by Judge Jack.
In particular, the feds aim to prevent Jim or anybody putting
discovery materials on the Internet, a goal that must be countered
by all means and methods if the stuff can be liberated.
Even so, Jim's motions offer vivid descriptions of what has been
happening to Jim, not only since his arrest, but well before,
even before his first trial, as well as events within prison and
after release.
If true, and the current federal abuse helps make his story
plausible, the feds have been long pursuing Jim and his
cohorts, using a variety of illegal methods -- for surveillance, investigation, searches, arrests, evidence tampering, abuse of the federal rules of procedure, treatment of prisoners, denial of legal rights, and more.
I've been asked by Jim's current PD to appear as a witness on his behalf and welcome the opportunity to do so if I can get assurance that Jim will get legal representation much
superior to what he has gotten so far. How that will mesh with the feds subponea of me as their witness remains to be seen.
The feds are being super shitty in this case, moreso than
in Bell 1 and with CJ. I think that is because they have been
up to greater evil than ever and intend to enhance that
method to intimidate dissidents and those interested in
such cases.
It's clear that Jim Bell is a pretext for this campaign of aggression
against dissidence, a poster boy for what is to come in the way of federal law-massaging injustice.
Jeff Gordon wrote me to say that to get my grand jury testimony
I will need to make a motion to the magistrate in charge of the
grand jury -- just in time to leave no time to make that motion and
get a response before the trial. Why Robb didn't tell me that in January is now clear: the sonofabitch didn't want me to know I was being stalled by his unresponsiveness and that now surely his selective misuse of my GJ testimony.
Should be an educational experience at the trial to learn what
the feds got cooked up to dangle Jim as bait for other fishes.
What's up with Declan's fighting his subpoena? Is the press
rallying to one of their own? ACLU on the case? 60 Minutes

@_subject: Screwing Jim Bell Royally 2 
We offer the court docket of March 23, 2001 and a couple
of dozen recent filings, most of them by Jim Bell, with a couple
of the judge's orders:
   Here's a sample of the feds and Jim going at it:
Jack E. Tanner, US District Judge, ORDER, January 11, 2001:
  "THE COURT, being advised by the Government of   the defendant's (James Bell) stated intention of publishing   discovery materials in this case on the Internet, which   discovery materials include voluminous private information   and personal addresses of various individuals, HEREBY   ORDERS that no materials disclosed by the government   as part of its discovery obligation shall be shared by   defense counsel with the defendant until further notice   of the court." Jim Bell, Defendant's Self-Filed Supplemental Response to  Government's Proposed Order Concerning Defendant's
Access to Discovery Material, March 16, 2001:
        "Comes now the Defendant, James Dalton Bell, who declares that
        he is effectively and unwillingly unrepresented, and that
        his 6th Amendment Right to Counsel has been repeatedly and
        intentionally violated since on or about December 1, 2000.
        Defendant Bell has repeatedly sent letters to the court asking
        for substitute counsel, and two separate motions by attorney
        Robert Leen have been essentially ignored since mid-
        December, 2000.
            2. The arrogance strongly implied in the government's
        proposed ORDER GOVERNING DEFENDANTS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY
        MATERIALS CONTAINING HOME ADDRESSES AND OTHER PERSONAL
        INFORMATION is truly astounding. (Hereafter I refer to this
        monstrosity as the Proposed Access Order, or PAD.)
            3. The government has said exactly nothing supporting,
        detailing, or explaining their desires. Which addresses
        are they trying to "protect"? How many? Whose? For what
        reason? For how long? Does the government believe that
        these addresses were somehow obtained "illegally" or that
        their mere possession is somehow illegal? Why has essentially
        all discovery material been denied Defendant Bell for 3+
        months due merely to a few "addresses"7
            4. The government hasn't even said, openly, where this
        material came from: Defendant Bell suspects that all of the
        material (at least that portion containing the "addresses"
        came from the November 6 search and thus, from the Defendant
        himself by the thinking of the government. Is the government
        entitled to bar the defendant from doing (legal) things
        with this information? Permanently?
            5. Is the government suggesting that this material
        or any of it is somehow "illegal information"? Or would the
        government like it to be considered illegal information?
        That would certainly explain some of the government's odd
        behavior over the last 3+ months.
            6. Could it be that the real reason this material was
        taken November 6 had nothing to do with any crime then-
        suspected or later-charged, but in fact was taken in a ruse?
        Defendant Bell reminds the Court and government that he has
        not yet been given an Evidentiary Hearing, which due to the
        highly unusual specifics of this case must occur many weeks
        before any anticipated trial. Bell anticipates that this
        hearing will reveal that all the material taken November 6
        will be easily provable to have been entirely-legal
        information, but taken by an illegally-requested and illegally
        executed search done by people who intended at all times
        simply to deprive Bell of his properly-owned information.
             7. Defendant Bell concurs with Leen's conclusion that
        "The Government's proposal is completely unacceptable to the
        defense." However, Leen's proposed "solution" clearly reflects
        an inadequate and incomplete level of objection to the
        government's wholly outrageous proposal. Defendant Bell
        suggests that America's history and practice of "public trials"
        with public testimony and public evidence, is supposed to be
        primarily intended to protect a defendant's rights, but is
        secondarily and strongly intended to protect the public (and
        NOT simply the government-employed public!) against crooked
        government officials and employees and their practices.
             Indeed, for example one of the most direct impediments to
        espionage trials is the usual requirement that "classified"
        evidence must be de-classified to be used at trial. This makes
        it public information! Prosecutor London is apparently
        treating this case as if it were a spy trial, but at the same
        time he is cutting corners, legally, by asking for (and
        receiving, if the sham continues) the luxury of keeping the
        "classified information (in reality, people's addresses) secret
        both during and (presumably?) after trial! So far he won't even
        say how many such addresses he wishes to protect in this way!
        (less than a dozen? Hundreds? Thousands?)
             8. Even more oddly, London's PAO clearly anticipates
        showing all of this material to Defendant Bell, presumably
        including the addresses he wishes to "protect," while the more
        "obvious" solution in such cases would be to redact (black out
        in a copy, or cut out, etc) whatever information he doesn't
        wish Bell to have.
             While Bell can't endorse either system for obvious reasons,
        he can at least point out that the latter system would have
        the major advantage of not impeding his access to the vast
        majority of materials whe~e there is no arguable problem,
        including not prohibiting him from even taking notes (!)
        which would seem to be a thoroughly obnoxious attack on his
        ability to prepare a competent defense!
             Defendant Bell has already argued and accused the
        government in his other filings of simply intending to delay
        his case and impeding his preparation of his defense for 3+
        months (as of 3/10/01) on the flimsy fabricated excuse of
        denying him access to a few "addresses."  If the government
        is now willing to show him all of discovery including those
        addresses (but with extreme impediments to his access to and
        use of all of it, including the vast and presumably non-
        controversial majority) but is not willing to give him
        unimpeded access to a redacted version, this will prove beyond
        all doubt that Bell's accusations were absolutely true."

I returned a telephone message today left on the 22
asking me to call about appearing as a witness for
Jim Bell. The name Leen was cited (Robert Leen is
Jim's PD). The number left, 1-800-797-6722, turned
out to be the Public Defenders Office. A man who
answered passed me to the US Attorney's Office,
to a Jennifer Mullane, who was out, so I left a message
to call me.
Nobody called back so I called Robert Leen's office, and
spoke to Leen. He said oh yes John Young, you're a
friend of Jim Bell's. I said, no, I'm a supporter. Well, he
said, I've seen an email you wrote to Jim which the
government is going to use in the trial, so that is what
I meant by you being a friend. The email they questioned you about in the grand jury.
I said I had not written Jim any email and told the grand
jury that I'd posted a message on a public list, not sent
one to Jim directly. Oh, Leen said.
I asked if he or Jim had arranged the call about my
being a witness for Jim. He said, no, not that I'm
aware of. Jim has prepared a witness list but you're
not on it. But I'm not getting along with Jim so I can't
be sure. You probably know that a lot of people don't
get along with Jim,
I didn't answer that.
He said you probably were called about being a
government witness, because we didn't call you.
I said I had got a government subpoena already.
He said that was for the grand jury, right.
I said, no, another subpoena for the trial. That is
what makes the call last week about being a witness
for Jim curious.
Leen said. I'll look into it and call you tomorrow.
An hour later I got the message from Jeff about the
trial being postponed a day.
Here's Jim's March 18 filing of a partial witness list:
  Comes now the Defendant, James Dalton Bell, who declares that
  he is effectively and unwillingly unrepresented, and that
  his 6th Amendment Right to Counsel has been repeatedly and
  intentionally violated since on or about December 1, 2000.
  Defendant Bell has repeatedly sent letters to the court asking
  for substitute counsel, and two separate motions by attorney
  Robert Leen have been essentially ignored since mid-
  December, 2000.

jail are being recorded, and states he was notified they would

Where this "friend" shit is coming from is a fair question. Whether
from Jim or the proponents of the fictitious "cypherpunk movement"

Seems to me that having people in public places armed with
weapons is wonderful. Mostly hand stuff so far, but there were
a few heavy MGs around Lower Manhattan for a brief period
after D-Day. RPG launchers and backpacks filled with reloads
is darned exciting compared to the usually attention getting
couture. You see this good stuff in photos of foreign lands
but seldom here at home where most of it manufactured
but not worn around the neighborhood and at work and play.
Well, sure gun shows show piddly fashion ornaments, but
not the heavy killers. And air shows of WMDs are widely
spaced, the best overseas. More needed at home, mix
the warplanes with the airliners, good for protection and
exciting for passengers and top guns alike.

Now people do get sent to prison and executed on the basis of unture

Local reports of eyewitnesses say an engine came off first,
and landed separately from the plane. The plane came in
"flat," not nosediving, thus perhaps somewhat under the pilot's control. Plane was zigzagging before it crashed.
The A300 can be landed without power, thus stable with
both engines gone. The engine that came off could have
caused destablization.
No evidence of an attack. However, terrorist games often
include scenarios of an ground to air attack on planes
leaving Kennedy as they pass over the lightly populated
areas of Queens (a lot of open water and marshlands).
No eyewitness accounts of missile tracks. One witness
of the engine falling said he heard no explosion beforehand.
Another said the sound of the plane was unusual, more
like a jet fighter than an airliner. Jet fighters are on regular
patrol around the city and NY airports.
As reported, bridges and tunnels closed, except some outbound traffic allowed. Phones here are jammed.

Aren't these kind of rigs used to survey, triangulate and record
large numbers of ground-based transceivers?
If so, they are similar to rigs which do geological surveys
with packs of machines you can see traversing likely oil
reserves. Odd looking, six or so trucks, bumper to bumper,
running 50 yards or so, pausing, an almost inaudible hammering on the ground, then rushing ahead to the
next stop. Logs of these soundings are reportedly
transmitted directly to home base, encrypted, so the
trucks cannot be hijacked or intercepted by competitors.
So the wishful thinking goes.
In the case of aerial surveys of radio frequencies, it is
possible to spoof signals by tucking the genuine in amongst
"static." But successful evasion depends on the snoopers
not have quick-witted algorithms to snatch the static,
even if it's burst transceivals, and make sense of it.
If you encrypt the sneaky signal you're dead meat.
Again, learning from the oil patch pirates, you can lay off
over the horizon and grab the sounding data by reading
the ground signal in the clear not the encrypted air data. But beware of chaff sent out by the trucks to thwart that such angle snooping.
Some packs of trucks are reconnaissance by fire.
As are some of the aerial surveys, which invite
tracking of the overt apparatus to snatch the pirates'
interceptions by way of reverse engineering the
snoop with an array so large you wouldn't know it
was there unless you had an antenna capable of
reading it. Some locate components of the
secondary receiver city-wide, or maybe wider.
Some radio engineers think the mobile phone system
transceivers are used for that very, very wide array purpose tucked dual-use below the consumer usage.
Would mobile phones also serve as unwitting contributors to a large area transceiver? Sophicticated geological sensors can certainly get pretty good readings from heavy traffic
on the interstate, and it gets better as the highways
deteriorate. Concrete expansion joints are wondrous

References: How would the LME work on the interior structure of the plane?
The skin has little structural strength but does streamline the
structure and I suppose if it was weakened to peel away,
turbulence could shear structural bolts or welds. The tail section
of 587 appeared to be cleanly detached from the fuselage and
not obviously torn.
Vibration of the tail could have loosened or fractured bolts or welds
sufficiently to break away under the forces of take-off and/or
turbulence from the preceding 747.
Still, if the tail was subject to vibration that would have made its
attachments a likely assembly to check frequently.
Several recent FAA airworthiness directives for the A300 listed problems needing attention but nothing on the tail assembly.
Which doesn't mean squat necessarily, since expected accidents usually don't happen.
However, because tails seldom come loose, I understand, if an
attacker wanted to do the unexpected on a part little suspected
of failure, the tail connection would be a good target. One pilot
was quoted as saying no better failure could have been arranged to assure disaster. That is, loss of tail is not in featured
the emergency recovery manual -- at least in civilian aircraft.
I believe loss of tail is included in military emergency planning
due to their being good vertical targets for missiles, shells and
shrapnel. Some military tails are oversized for the plane to
survive loss of a good portion of the tail (although not likely
for entire tail loss except for two-tailed craft).

Time Magazine, November 26, 2001:
Denning's pioneering a new field she calls geo-encryption.
Working with industry, Denning has developed a way to keep
information undecipherable until it reaches its location, as
determined by GPS satellites. Move studios, for example,
have been afraid to release films digitally for the same reasons
record companies hate Napster: once loose on the Internet,
there's little to stop someone from posting the latest blockbuster
DVD on the Web for all to see and download. With Denning's
system, however, only subscribers in specified locations --
such as movie theaters -- would be able to unscramble the
data. The technology works as well for national security
as it does for Harry Potter. Coded messages that the State
Department sends to its embassies, for example, could only
be deciphered in the embassy buildings themselves, greatly
reducing the risk of interception.
For now, Denning says, terrorists "may want to bring down
the power grid or the finance system, but it's still easier to
blow up a building." If she's right, it's due in large part to her.

CoinCard uses a system composed of a swipe card and passive card reader to decrypt, described in a programmers' manual:

down the coast and inland. The laboratory's officials claim there is no threat to
the public, that their research only involves foot and mouth
disease. Nobody believes that for infected deer have turned
up in CT and small mammals and birds on Long Island.
I've not seen any mention of Plum Island in connection

Probably not:

There are numerous changes in PATRIOT from MATA and ATA,
and it has over twice their length. It still uses the same
obfuscation style of burying dozens of proposals as modifications
of existing legislation, making it hard to understand what is
being proposed without jigsaw puzzling the pieces into the legislation being modified to see what the whole picture
will be when assembled. An underhanded method compared
to Leahy's open-book bill.
Creepy to read the massive shutdown planned for the Canadian
border. Canada is surely to scream economic warfare at the US's
pressure to close liberal immigration and civil liberty loopholes --
it doesn't look good for ZKS. What's the assessment within,
To be sure, the US and its iron-maidenish allies are rushing
to close loopholes around the world, and one bad effect of
PATRIOT is for it to be used as a model for other countries
to toe the line and consequent clampdown on security
technologies. And pressure to shut Sealand, perhaps to
require the Bunkers to allow rummaging the precious data.
PATRIOT does just about everything Stewart Baker's Defense
Science Board panel recommended for legal policy to protect US national security, in particular the sharing of domestic
law enforcement, FBI, DoJ and IRS databanks with the military and the spooks and vice versa. Under the Ashcroft plan anyone can be declared by the Attorney General to be a terrorist or a supporter/advisor of terrorism and with that all civil liberities of the targets disappear.
For example, those constitutional rights Tim claimed a hour ago are still in effect in the US. But not if this bill passes. I suspect insulting a cop will become quickly a terrorist's mark of Cain. Much less refusing a National Guard order at the airport. A quick addition of the misbehaver to the US Stasi databank and a lifetime investigation and harassment commences -- or if the target gets Tim-like uppity a hole in the head made by lead or
enforced psychotherapy, totally approved by terrorist-drunk courts of jurisdiction. USA. USA.
Remember, do not say out loud, "fuck that." Think abou it,
then decide to self-suppress for a couple of years, then

Today I managed to walk around the stupefying WTC
disaster site for half an hour, doing what a serious professional would be doing: taking dozens of careful photographs of the ruins. Then an NYC cop asked to see my authorization to
be photographing a crime scene. I said nobody told me not to. He said come with me, and told a captain who asked how the fuck did you get in here. I said I just walked in, nobody stopped me. Captain checked my ID and my tale about safety-surveying the neighborhood
as a volunteer, and said escort this guy off the scene. Then I was handed over to the State Police who had
me repeat my reason for being there, took my fancy
digital camera, looked at the photos and bygod erased
all of them. Then I was handed over to the National
Guard who is in charge of perimeter security, and I
again had to explain that I just walked in, that there
were no barriers and no guards the way I came.
While that was happening two dozen victim families
were escorted to the site to stare at the devastation, carrying flowers, weeping, holding each other, some
stumbling, looking as if walking into hell -- which it
truely is. Shit.
I got my name put in a database and a warning to not come back or face arrest. I said thank you and did
not even for a second think to say fuck off for which you may shit on me.
Now the help I need is how to recover the erased
images from the Compact Flash memory chip. Norton's unerase detects no remnants of the JPG images. I would really appreciate pointers on how to reclaim the images: they show godawful stuff I've not seen published anywhere else. No human
remains as far as I can tell just dumbfounding acres
of what used to be and the giant machines and
tiny workers trying to untangle it.
If anybody can tell me how to get the images restored I'll be immensely grateful -- technique or a program
to buy. And I'll put the images on the Web as soon as reborn. They are high res images, 1MB or so each, and should be gruesomely spectacular, if only they can be unerased. Crime scene indeed.
What I admired was the grandstand set up by the Port
Authority for distinguished visitors to survey the
spectacle and be televised saying how awful it is
and how much money is need to rebuild New York
and what must be done to prevent this ever happening
again. That grandstand looked like the crime scene to me.

My panicky state and lack of Googling was due to learning

I had thought my obsequy had kept the camera and memory
chip from being confiscated. While being mesmerized by
a hypnotic Lady Smokey reading me Miranda, crimson nails
caressing her massive Beretta, luscious full lips mouthing me rights beyond ... Gent Smokey was deleting my reason for
obeying every command in the vicinity to escape losing the

Thanks, thanks. Now to compress these 1 MB buggers into
transferrable size. They look fantastic in all senses, but
not due to any talent, it's all the camera and its amazing

Listen, if you don't have a digital camera with a maximum
size Compact Flash, you don't know what it is to get a
perfect picture every snap. With a 192MB chip you can
take a 150 or so high res images, and are they beautiful,

there are later, better models from Nikon and others.
The 192MB chip can also allow you to swallow all your secret

guarding its nearly worthless information. AIA does only
what it takes to get its members jobs. I tried to do volunteer
work for the local AIA chapter surveying buildings around WTC, but later learned that its program is open only to members seeking paid work at the disaster. I was at the WTC site following a volunteer inspection of
a local terrified office renter who called the AIA for assistance and was given a list of expensive architects whose fees have jumped, and told no volunteers available. Word of
mouth got me. And I got to the WTC for excellent payment.

Now we shouldn't overvalorized those working the crime scene.
This is not a war site by any stretch, it's a disaster site and
nobody is getting shot at or threatened by hundreds of officers
and military standing around with their thumbs up. The spin on
this racket does remind of war mongerers, so that is much is
true, but the pornography is by the pols and mongerers.
There are hard workers on the site, doing dirty dangerous work, but not most of the squeaky cleans, saluting one another,
discussing when to take a break, swapping tales of pussy
and liquor, angling for the attention of any camera in sight,
kissing superiors' asses.
The site is way over staffed and equipped, with much of
the staff and stuff unused, again like a war where only
a tiny majority ever risk shit. War stories are pornographic
lies no matter who tells them, and the best lies are told
by police and the military.
Hats off to the few hard workers I saw at WTC, a big Bronx
cheer to the 90% on the site who were there for racking up
points and lurid tales to tell the rubes on- and off-site.
Speaking from one jerk's experience, the officers and soldiers
seemed relieved to have me to deal with. Not much, but better
than hosting the gaggle of celebrities who look through them
until the photo crew are set up, then profuse thanks, then
lights out and off to the limo.
I think the reason Smokey deleted my photos is because I
took no pix of the spic and span uniformed idlers. Shit, I heard
a group of cops discussing what kind of groovy hardhat to
wear, what kind of flags to costume in. Paratroopers halting
a cute female officer, raining her with a bevy of different salutes until she rushed away red-faced.
Even so, I thanked every officer I dealt with for their
sacrifices. No bullshit, having been a soldier the terror
comes in a instant, and waiting for years doing nothing doesn't make it less so. Waiting for hell to break is what these folks
do for a living. And I appreciate that protection. It is easy

@_subject: WTC Collapse Alternative 
What is odd about the WTC debris is how few larger fragments of concrete it contains. Reports on the structure say reinforced concrete was used for floor slabs and customarily in demolition such material breaks apart in relatively large chunks, the broken concrete remaining attached by steel reinforcing bars or wire mesh. However, there is a structural design where plain concrete is placed on metal floor decking with little or no reinforcing. Also, lightweight concrete, whose course aggregate is cinder rather than stone, is often used to limit the weight of the structure, especially
in high-rise building. This lightweight material does not usually have the strength of regular concrete and strength is provided by metal decking below it. The large amount of dust produced by the towers' collapse and the relative lack of larger concrete shards raise the possibility that the building disintegrated at least in part due to lesser strength of the type of concrete used in the floors. That remains to be examined.
Observation of the towers' remains show that while main steel vertical structural members of the exterior wall and central core withstood the collapse, the horizontal floor-supporting trusses broke away from these vertical supports at the points of attachment (probably made by welding). One view of the North Tower (1 WTC) shows the exterior and core remnants and the ruptured points
of floor structure attachment. Photos:         What this suggests is the possibility that the structure of each floor collapsed due to load of collapsing floors above them, and that only afterwards did the vertical supports at the exterior and core collapse. Review of video of the collapse appears to confirm this sequence as well as the consequent supposition that the floor structure was the weakest part of the buildings

It would not take a lot of explosives to breakaway an entire floor
constructed with steel joists like WTC; it is often done in planned demolitions with a small charge placed at each joist support --
customarily a shelf angle either continuous or segmented.
What would do it though without explosives is the twisting torque and vertical flexing in the tower tubes caused by an aircraft hitting off center of the tower's axis at 300 mph. Survivors tell of the tower swaying several feet, but they are not likely to have perceived the torque as such. The hit on the South Tower (the second hit) was more off center than that on the North Tower.
Tall buildings are designed with some torque resistance against
turbulent weather and earthquake but probably not for torque coupled with high impact. The WTC towers were made of two tubes, the exterior wall system (the more flexible) and the interior core (the more rigid), the two tubes connected by light-weight floor structures and at about 1/3 intervals, heavy-weight transfer and mechanical equipment angles welded to vertical supports. These angles are designed to
support vertical loads not much twisting.
The joists could have lost their support by tower twisting of no more than a few inches, the shelf angle welding beads popping, or the joists slipping off the angles that did not break loose (as photos
show many did not).
If the floor slab concrete was not reinforced it would have crumbled
easily under torque. Again, most building structure is designed to
resist vertical loading not substantial twisting. (Structural connections are designed to resist relatively minor twisting caused by static
and dynamic loading.)
There is a valid question of why the buildings did not collapse immediately if floor structures were damaged and serial pancaking set in motion.
The raging fires surely contributed to further weakening of the
building structure, but probably due to adverse effect on floor structures
and in particular on the light-weight shelf-angle welded connections between the floor system and the heavy-weight vertical supports.
It is at these connections that demolition designers place light-weight
charges, as well as heavy-weight cutting charges on vertical supports.
For comparison, a WTC shelf angle may be 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick welded with a bead about the same while a vertical columnon WTC could average 2-3 inches thick, increasing in thickness from top to
The WTC designers claim the buildings were capable of withstanding
a 727 hit, asserted at original building and after the 1993 bombing.
But the design criteria for that protection have not been published
so it cannot be determined what crash scenario was used for design.

There are fascinating parts of my message that haven't come

headers we've got it if we can prove the information is false. Which Tony Smith didn't do beyond being, apparently, buffaloed by disclaimers that are standard smoke for shenanigans, at least as far as his retraction went. Could be he's blowing smoke to cover his own looking more closely at the matter.
Hal's Finney's critique was pretty good, but I assume it was
based on the information that has been made public. Tony Smith
didn't report stuff in the message I got, again not that we
got the same message. Nor did he report the results of a
follow-up from his source if he asked for it.
What we have done with a bit of technical tracking and matching
time data is get within one or two boxes of the source, ID'ed an unusual browser type, the operating system, some other yadda log file stuff.
Fingering the source is the last thing to do, and then only if the
episode was rigged by RIAA or other alleged attendees.

@_subject: Tracking the RIAA Source 
Thanks to help from a person here we have developed a
likely source for the RIAA meeting messages, and at the
moment it appears likely Safeweb was used to send the messages as well as check on the Cryptome file.
Safeweb appears to dynamically assign addresses to users,
though within a limited range which might be set by the location
of the user, but we are not sure of that. Indeed, if Safeweb
does not cloak location by avoiding a predictable range that
would be a serious weakness. But we need to test that.
Safeweb is, at least in part, hosted by the giant ISP Abovenet,
home-based in San Jose, CA, with facilities all around the
US and overseas. To help us triangulate a likely location
from which the messages were sent we need to log accesses
to Cryptome from a variety of US and overseas locations.
For example I get the same range of addresses as those of the RIAA messages and file accesses by logging in from New York
City to Safeweb.com then using Safeweb to request a Cryptome file. What I don't know is whether those same addresses would
be used from other physical locations around the world.
For anybody who wants to risk giving away their own location
I ask that accesses be made from the Safeweb.com from any location in the world to a fictitious file on Cryptome:
  Replace xxxxxxx with a clue to your location, say, texas, germany,
whereever I could identify.
The request will generate an error code and an originating address
from Safeweb which I can use to compare to what I've got for
the RIAA messages and for NYC. Presumably Safeweb will cloak
your actual IP address.
Let me emphasize that I do not yet believe the source was
perpetrating a hoax, or if so whether the hoax was run to
benefit RIAA which is the current outcome. My intention is not to out the source if the leak is legitimate, but I damn well want to broadcast it if RIAA, its friends or a TLA cooked up the ruse.

About half the pings timed out before the last hop at:

A few hit a "private" address after 208.184.48.173:
  10.100.0.2 (no location)
before ending at:
  64.124.150.130.safeweb.com (San Jose, CA)
The station locations were provided by trace route program
Interpretation is needed for:
1. How much about the Safeweb stations is true and how much cloaking.
2. Why some pings timed out and others didn't.
3. Phantom station 10.100.0.2
4. Whether the San Jose hops actually go to San Jose or are spoofed.
5. Why go to New York then hop across the continent unless the
last hops are just administrative not physical.
6. How is cloaking done on addresses and physical locations
Is cloaking done by a Safeweb program, say by address spoofer or by phantom proxies, or is there a way to do this by special agreement with Network Central (whatever that is), say, as Intel Web and other classified systems covertly use the Web.
Recall that Safeweb was selected for financial support by the
CIA so intel officers could use it to cloak their Net use. And other
programs such as Onion make use of sub-Net features not easily
available to the surface user.
Now, onto news of the RIAA leaker (not yet a proven hoaxer despite
Declan, RIAA and friends hoaxing that).
We received a third message yesterday from the alleged source of the RIAA allegations who was pissed at our attempts to trace
the source. Use of Safeweb was admitted. Angry words were
hurled at us. Allegations were made that parties have been
punished for the leak though not the leaker who fears that
information about the traces could be used for that. Here's
our response:
October 11, 2001
I very much appreciate your concern. I have stated publicly
that I do not yet believe there has been a hoax and that the source of the messages will not be disclosed if the messages can be shown to be legitimate.  Not that I have any hard information
on who you are. And don't need to know who you are so long
as your information is reliable. Hell, it doesn't have to be reliable
just provocative and unsettling.
Right now there is a push on by a host of people to promote that the messages are a hoax, and if they prevail RIAA will be the main beneficiary. And a great story becomes a bore.
It is to head off that win by RIAA, to avoid giving them improved
protection against future abuses as a result of the alleged hoax, that I wish to get from you information that will demonstrate there was no hoax. Again without putting you in jeopardy.
In a tough fight like this RIAA and its supporters will do whatever
they can to smear and deny your revelations. That's the
way it is, so fighting back is the only answer to prevent an
RIAA win by default as result of your valiant effort.
Listen, this very thing happens every time we put up a
controversial document, and your protection is paramount,
but opponents of publication will fight like hell to deny
the truth. But you surely know that. Now is when the
going gets tough. You need to decide how to avoid losing
this battle, losing your reputation and the whole shebang.
I say come forth with proof of the meeting and comments
made, provide it through a secure channel to protect your
identity. But don't let this story die a useless death.
Tony Smith ducked and ran. Not here, the story stays on
Cryptome, along with the story of what happened after
your account was published. Disinformation is as good
as information, maybe better. But if you want to abandon what you started, I'll understand
and wait for the next opportunity to buck the fuckers.

@_subject: RIAA Safeweb Proxy ID 
Thanks to SC:
[SC's IP address replaced by xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx]
I've tuned in late to the riaa/safeweb thing, but I'm chiming in with my bit.
Tracing from safeweb is an interesting exercise; the geography is
very typical of the internet backbone and the router hops packets
I wrote a script to mail all possible headers from a connecting
browser to myself. I installed it on my server
   and then connected from Safeweb. This anonymizer uses a caching proxy server, listening for
connections on several IPs; it preserves client headers while
obviously changing the IP of the originating connection; it preserves
many of the originating headers; it adds some new headers. Here's the output:
DATE_LOCAL..........Saturday, 13-Oct-2001 01:22:45 EDT
HTTP_ACCEPT..........image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg,
image/pjpeg, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint, application/vnd.ms-excel,
application/msword, */*
HTTP_IF_MODIFIED_SINCE..........Sat, 13 Oct 2001 05:15:44 GMT;
DATE_GMT..........Saturday, 13-Oct-2001 05:22:45 GMT
HTTP_USER_AGENT..........Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows
NT 5.0)
HTTP_VIA..........1.0 anongo.com:3128 (Squid/2.3.STABLE3)
The last one in the list is the flavour of proxy they use:
  Squid/2.3.stable3
And the DNS name of the source box for the HTTP request
is anongo.com, which I don't believe showed up in your trace logs. Basically a caching proxy server's header set.
The authoritative name servers for anongo.com are   ns3.above.net
 redirects to Safeweb. The boxes are standard
unix/apache with ssl. They have written scripts to replace the
originating address header and keep track of the connection, receive
requested files to their cache, and then serve from that cache to
your browser.
The machines would absolutely be configured to do sophisticated
logging; there is no free lunch on the net. While they appear to do a
nice job, their server logs would be a goldmine. Everyone who uses a
commercial web browser agrees to have their information gathered the
first time they use that browser - do you want to continue? When you
say yes, you mean it!

The source last wrote that "multiple" Safeweb protection
was used to cloak the messages. Is there a way to chain
Hotmail to Safeweb, or some other way to "multiple"
Safeway protection as preamble to Hotmail?
It would be intriguing to learn that the source is

  "It is a HTTP server (running AkamaiGHost)."
But why seemingly terminate in Los Angeles? Is that a cloaking device? Usually when a final hop is blocked VisualRoute reports
the block, but not in these cases. Both traces' final two hops:

The Wall Street Journal of October 18 quoted portions of Congressional
testimony by Ken Alibek, former top Russian biowar researcher, as
saying that of the five main purposes for developing anthrax as a
weapon, the least importnat purpose was injuring or killing people. The most important purpose was to create terror and panic.
Alibek was reported to have said that anthrax was not that dangerous,
that it took a substantial dose to cause injury and more to kill, that
even crop-dusting Washington DC with weapons grade stuff would
not kill the huge numbers alleged.
But that lack of effectiveness was not what was to be publicized, he said, instead development of the anthrax attack system included massive disinformation about its lethality before all else. In short,
anthrax is primarily psywar (as is most NBCI WMD).
Richard Preston is his two New Yorker articles* a while back heavily
relied upon Alibek for his terrifying bio-WMD scenarios. I don't recall Alibek being so whipsaw disinformational in those articles as he allegedly was in briefing Congress how to whipsaw the public.

Continuing to beat the drum, today's Wall Street Journal
offers two essays on how much liberty to give up for safety.
One, an Op-Ed by a historian, recounts how in the past the United States Presidents have imposed draconian wartime draconian security measures and trashed civil liberties far
more than anything currently contemplated, naming Adams, Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, among others. But claims that after the crises passed civil liberties were restored "stronger than ever." So fear not what is in the offing.
The second, by a WSJ columnist, argues that enough is
too much, that the Bush Administration halt curtailment
of civil liberties, and that the sunset provisions of current anti-terrorism proposals are a good thing. These wafflings are diabolical apologies for what Bush
coupers are up to, offerings of amelioration to disarm
critics. Woolsey, Stew Baker, Bork, the WSJ, the host of oilers

@_subject: War Criminals 
Paul Krugman, Economic Columnist, New York Times, 24 October 2001:
At worst, war bonds will offer a lower return than ordinary bonds. And if some people buy them nonetheless, what will they finance? Here's where that tax bill enters the picture. The remarkable thing about the 'stimulus' package that passed the Ways and Means Committee on a straight party-line vote is that it barely even pretends to serve its ostensible function. It consists largely of permanent tax cuts, not the temporary cuts that you would expect in a stimulus package. It systematically gives money to those least likely to spend it, that is, to high-income taxpayers, and above all to large corporations. Some of the provisions in the House bill are simply mind-boggling. For example, there is a large *retroactive* tax cut for corporations that would lead to immediate rebates of hundreds of millions of dollars to *each* of a select list of giant companies, many of them in the energy industry (though the $1.4 billion check to I.B.M. would top the list). On the other hand, there is almost nothing in the bill for people who might actually need more money. The extra unemployment benefits, in particular, are far less generous than those offered in the last recession, when the elder Bush was president. The bill, in short, looks as if it was written by corporate lobbyists -- and it probably was. Even Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill was evidently embarrassed by the bill, dismissing its more outlandish components as 'show business' designed to impress campaign But his remark was naove. Those lobbyists are serious men, who are paid by their employers to deliver results, not gestures; they wouldn't have put those provisions in unless they thought they had enough power to get them enacted. And sure enough, the White House soon contradicted Mr. O'Neill; the president, declared Ari Fleischer, was 'very pleased' with the House bill. Which brings us back to those war bonds. The government not only isn't calling for shared sacrifice; it is 'very pleased' with a proposal to give billions in handouts to corporations. And in that case, what is someone who buys a war bond really helping to finance? Put it this way: If the House has its way, the government will give far more in tax breaks to corporations over the next year than it will spend fighting terrorism. Yet somehow one suspects that people would not rush to buy 'corporate tax-cut bonds.'

That was the initial perception. The NY Times had a report
yesterday about a pilot of one of the police choppers who described his futile rescue attempt -- he was on the scene
within ten minutes of the crash. The pilot said the smoke was blowing away from Tower 1 (the first hit) so there was a fair sized refuge for people to stand in any had accessed the roof. A thicket of antennas would have prevented landing but the pilot said there was a hoist onboard with a 200 foot cable capable of picking up people. A colleague was ready to descend to the roof to assist. Nobody came to the roof.
Another chopper hovered nearby to do the same. Other choppers
were on their way from Long Island but flights were cancelled
when it was reported nobody was on the roof.
The pilot said it was possible that at least a dozen or so
people could have been rescued before the collapse.
The pilot said at the 1993 bombing a cop was lowered to
cut away a wad of antennas so roof pickups could be made,
but that was too risky on 911.
The Times report said that only Los Angeles allows chopper
rescue from high rise buildings. Most fire departments believe
chopper rescue is too high risk and that exit by stairway is far safer. But in the light of WTC collapse fire departments are reviewing that prohibition.
The NY Fire Department, like many FDs, has no choppers,
and sees police choppers as scenewhores. Not as bad
as Sir Rudy and the Fire Commish but close.

The harsh treatment appears to have been the cause of one

The New Yorker, October 29, 2001:
  "In recent weeks an ilite Pentagon undercover unit -- trained to slip into foreign countries and find suspected nuclear weapons, and disarm them if necessary -- has explored plans for an operation inside Pakistan. In 1998, Pakistan successfully tested a nuclear device, heralded as the Islamic world's first atomic bomb. According to United States government estimates, Pakistan now has at least twenty-four warheads, which can be delivered by intermediate-range missiles and a fleet of F-16 aircraft.
Some of the government's most experienced South Asia experts have doubts about Musharraf's ability to maintain control over the military and its nuclear arsenal in the event of a coup; there are also fears that a dissident group of fundamentalist officers might try to seize a warhead. The Army and the influential Inter-Services Intelligence, or I.S.I., have long-standing religious and personal ties to many of the leaders of the Taliban, dating back to Afghanistan's war against the Soviet Union in the nineteen-eighties, when Pakistan was the main conduit for American support.
The crisis may bring into play the ilite unit, operating under Pentagon control with C.I.A. assistance, whose mission it is to destroy nuclear facilities, past and present government officials told me.

They've had good success in proving the negative' -- that is, in determining that suspected facilities were not The American team is apparently getting help from Israel's most successful special-operations unit, the storied Sayeret Matkal, also known as Unit 262, a deep-penetration unit that has been involved in assassinations, the theft of foreign signals-intelligence materials, and the theft and destruction of foreign nuclear weaponry. Members of the Israeli unit arrived in the United States a few days after September 11th, an informed source said, and as of last week were training with American special-forces units at undisclosed locations."

These allegations raise questions about the sufficiency of the legal restrictions placed on the collection and use of signals intelligence. The use of national intelligence assets to conduct industrial espionage for the benefit of American companies over their foreign competitors is controversial, but that issue turns primarily upon matters of policy rather than law. This Note will focus on the legal restrictions on signals intelligence (SIGINT) activities and, thus, will set aside the primarily policy-driven question of using national intelligence assets to conduct economic espionage."

On ZKS selling anonymizing products that are publicly available to governmental officials does raise an issue of whether officials
should, or should be able to, conceal their official identities when working cyberspace in an official capacity. I think not, though
it might be as impossible to get officials to comply as with
terrorists so long as the technology is there.
Paul Sylverson, at NRL, took me to task recently for outing
officials, claiming that one of the primary purposes of onion
routing was to allow officials to conceal their actions in
cyberspace. I answered that it was my opinion that officials
had no right to conceal their identity when on the job, not
the military, not the spooks, indeed, they should be obliged
to reveal identity in cyberspace when at work, if not of the
person then of the agency.
Nobody has yet seen an fbi.gov in the logs, or nsa.mil/gov,
though a few ucia.gov and nro.gov crop up, and the ubiquitous That this would not apply to these officials in their private
lives, that then they deserved fullest possible privacy protection.
But none at all in their official roles.
I propose that all anonymizers adopt a code of practice that
any sale to officials of anonymizers or their use be disclosed to the public (I suggested this to ZKS early on when first meetings with the feds to explain the technology were being sometimes disclosed). That seems to be a reasonable response to officially-secret prowling and investigating cyberspace.
If officials want to do that in secret they should obtain a public
license, say to use onion, pipenet, remailers, or ZKS, Safeweb, and so on. That's a public license, not a government one, for
a fee to help pay for the public's use without cost.

I try to abide the principle that if one gets anonymized
all should. However, there is a disparity in who gets
to leverage that anonymity -- from the citizen to the
empowered official.
We have now more privilege of conealment on the official
side, and that needs redress, constant redress a rebel
might yell.
Not much of my proposal is radical: there is a long tradition
for officials to own up to what they do in their official
roles. The uniformed police, the uniformed military
services. That is far less done in the case of the spooks
and, increasingly lately, law enforcement and the military
as the latter adopt the practices and more importantly the technology of spooks -- and the spooks' lack of
public accountability (those oversight committees are
a fraud).
The culture of secrecy is vastly overweighted in favor of
government, and much of that derives from hoary claims
of national security. Undercover and covert operations
have become far more pervasive in the US government
and military than ever, and constitute a privileged elite in mil/gov, and often law enforcement, moving from the
federal agencies into state and locals -- and contractors
and suppliers for all these. And all are bound by a
complicitous and luxurious veil of secrecy.
It is fairly common for goodhearts to question government
but not when national security, and more recently, domestic
security, is bruited. But that is due to a well-crafted educational
campaign to raise national security to a theological level, and
its rational is itself cloaked in secrecy. A similar theologizing
is underway, methinks despite Declan's unreflective demurral,
in the campaign for combatting domestic terrorism, the
Homeland Defense demonolgy.
Having learned much here about the futility of trying to determine
who gets privacy technology and who does not, it remains true
that for most of us access to this technology is very recent and we
know not what lies outside our knowledge.
I am not as sanguine about government as I was before being
semi-educated by this list about what technology is in covert use.
And I am not as sanguine about the wisdom of providing technology
to government on the same footing as the citizen. There is more
than a bit of marketing opportunism is this view -- and government
knows very well what power the purse has to seduce young firms
into the world of secrecy.
So I say again, that despite it being economic foolhardiness, indeed
because it is that, there needs to be a code of practice for anonimyzer
developers to state their policy of helping governments snoop on
us without us knowing. Agnosticism in this matter is complicity
when such a stance cloaks government intrusiveness.
Look, I'll accept that we will all succumb to the power of the market,
so limit my proposal for full disclosure to those over 30. After that
age one should know there is no way to be truly open-minded.

Sorry, I'm not proposing a law, certainly not on this list.
Rather a voluntary concordance for reputation building,
not only in citizen-world but in government-world.
There has been a lot of good discussion about this
here in the past and I'm not going against that wisdom.
Greg is tracking that in one of his posts, and Declan
too if the focus on law is shifted to reputation. How
to build reputable products for privacy protection and
how to keep them trustworthy. Use of these by
officials to invade privacy will surely diminish the products. The capability of the intrusive products should extend to public warnings of likely abuses by whomever, but by officials most so.
Nothing unusual about that unless you want government
customers. And who doesn't after age 30. So, again,
daredeviling products are for those who have nothing to lose. You making profit, handsome profits, you won't
give them up for principle, right. That's okay, we are all
subject to enlightened self-interest, the same force
that leads officials to spy on us and criminalize
us doing it to them.
I foresee criminalizing anonymizers for us not them.
Their laws not ours. Ours is to . . . concord in sweet
harmony, as here we do -- until some mean son of

Thanks for the cites of Gatti.
Greg's disclosure of C2Net's sales is appreciated. Perhaps not
surprising. What would be surprising, maybe, would be disclosure
as ZKS did in its earliest days, of reporting on meetings C2Net was
having with law enforcement officials about its technology. Those
admirably exceptionable ZKS reports then stopped, at least I didn't
see them after the first few. What I got instead was a rush of advertising from ZKS. Fair enough, as far as business development goes.
Those singular souls working at ZKS in the cpunk spirit, are what makes me especially interested in the firm's welfare, in the light of its original goal to make available to the public quite strong privacy protection and anonymity tools. A plan pretty close to the exciting, customer-appealing
marketing method outlined by Greg.
The ZKS original model did indeed have an anti-authoritarian
streak. And presumbly the products live up to that promise.
And that is all they do.
If ZKS has only explained the technology to the LEAs and
sold them the same products as the public gets, then great.
And has not been persuaded to do a bit of dirty work as well
out of sight of the cpunks. End of concern. Buy its products, invest in it, make the hard workers rich.
Still, there is the PGP market model to ponder. And no believable
disclosure from Phil why he left, what was done to PGP he
could not bear to be a part of so took his settlement and
skipped his obligation to his supporters to disclose fully.
There is food for thought in why some people leave government
service and companies rather than continue to participate
in deceptive practices, though often still bound by secrecy
agreements and NDAs. I believe that a good bit of the earliest
public revelations of cryptology came from such people, as
did and does most secret technology used for intrusion
on private lives.
Diffie hints at being nudged or noodled toward PK by thoughtful
researchers. Today there are a host of ex-members of intel
agencies telling and warning what they can without being
One recurring theme of those who have worked inside the
world of secrecy is how that world has been corrupted by
excessive secrecy. And historians regularly write of
the corrupting influence of secrecy in government.
Undercover law enforcement agents are domestic spies,
dreaded secret police in other nations, no matter what spin is put on the need for such operations to fight crime, and they pose a greater danger to civil liberties than the spooks and military from whom they have acquired techniques and technologies devised to combat foreign enemies.
This is the crux of the homeland defense demonology, as
in times past with other internal demons: government officials
treating the citizenry as the enemy within and running secret
operations as if intelligence and military operations -- indeed
utilizing the resources of those powerful institutions by way
of inter-agency agreements to avoid violating law.
The Defense Science Board concluded in the Summer of
2000, in particular in its legal recommendations (a panel
chaired by ex-NSA counsel Stewart Baker) that it was
time to change law prohibiting domestic operations by
intel and the military, that this change is needed to combat
domestic terrorism and for "protecting the homeland."
The DSB report in two parts:
"Protecting the Homeland"
    "Defensive Information Operations"
   Painfully ironic is that "protecting the homeland" is a siren sung by every government, left, right and center,
which sees its citizenry as the enemy and argues the need for secret police, urges citizens informing on each other, runs secret courts, and generally
stigmatizes anti-government conduct, yes, and
Anybody who continues to argue that AP was not
used to convict Jim Bell, and that a crackdown on speech, not merely conduct, is not underway, lives in a bubble of ignorance or privilege. Or, more likely,
is peddling deception as successful businesses ever
must do after reaching maturity and youthful promises
peter out.

One of the best high-rise structural engineers in the world,
often consulted after failures, says that it cannot be known
for sure all the forces that a super-high-rise will face, even
with the best supercomputer modeling (though not at the
capability of Nat Lab nuclear similuations) for each is unique, often purposely unique, that each is an experiment,
and there is no testing laboratory except the building itself.
Most mid- and super-high-rises require remedial work
almost immediately, some even during construction, and
sensors are now always installed to provide feedback on
what the modeling says cannot be foretold with certainty.
Those which have undergone remediation in NYC that
I know about are numerous, and most of that has been
kept under wraps with NDAs of those designing the
corrections, to protect property values as well as
reputations and to fend off lawsuits.
The New Yorker a few years ago published one of the
few accounts not in technical journals about high-rise
remediation, in this case about CitiCorp's middling-rise, telling of the years-long attempt to avoid culpability not only by the original structural engineer but by a host of other prominents involved, despite repeated damning studies funded by occupant-leaseholders who could hear the building pop and creak, feel movement and see cracked interior walls.
No big deal, perhaps, for unique large architectural and civil
structures behave in unexpected ways, having no unique
precedent to learn from. The safest high-rises are those
that copy successes, and the successes are few for
super-high-rises, not many are built.
Ok, daring is needed, that is the architect's drug of choice
and sale, but recall the building code of Vitruvius: commodity, firmness and delight. The architectural delight drug needs the other two or why bother building at all, just take a pill. The skyscraper bounty of which is in short supply downtown these days. No matter, it will come raging back like a bull on Monday, or will that market crash too.

A local NYC TV show, The Digital Age, today had David Kahn and Steve Levy discussing crypto, bin Laden and 911 with the show's host, James Goodale, former vice-chairman of the New York Times.
The topic was what role encryption may have played
in 911.
Steve was persuasive in noting that crypto should not
be singled out as a lethal technology for terrorism any
more than other technology that could be put to malign
Cypherpunks got a plug from Steve for making encryption
"hip." Though Goodale attempted to get Steve to agree
that it was not a good thing for crypto to be liberated from
government control, Steve wouldn't buy that, and he credited
cypherpunks with a principal role in popularizing and spreading the technology, along with Phil Zimmermann's PGP effort. David Kahn agreed with Steve that there was nothing that could be done about loss of government control of encryption, the technology was out there for all to use for good or bad purposes.
David reaffirmed his belief that key escrow would have
been best for the country's security, but now it was no longer possible. (We heard David state that a few years
back at a crypto conference in NYC.)
David was emphatic that public key cryptography is the
single most important invention in the entire history of
cryptography. Diffie and Hellman were cited, but not
the British predecessors.

@_subject: Cpunks Lauded 
References: After Levy explained the role of non-gov cryptographers in freeing
cypto from government control, with a mention of cypherpunks, the host, Goodale, pressed Kahn and Levy to agree that "punks" and "nerds" should be held accountable for the likely damage to national
security that followed. Goodale said punks and nerds with disparagement, as if speaking of anti-socials. He appeared to
be expressing a view not his alone but one discussed in the clubs
of centralized power.
Neither Levy nor Kahn agreed with that view. Levy in particular
defended the liberation of crypto with conviction such that Goodale
backed off, saying he only meant to state the accusation strongly to
get a good response. Again, Goodale seemed to be following an agenda for assigning blame for 911 to crypto availability.
Neither Levy nor Kahn cited that investigators have found no use
of crypto by the 911 attackers.
Levy made the points that nobody knows for sure whether crypto
is in use by terroritsts but that it most likely is; that bin Laden
would never use an escrow-compromised program; that nobody
knows what NSA can crack; that the weakness of crypto is
in the implementation not the mathematics; that traffic analysis
was used to trace terrorist activities in the embassy bombing
investigation. Kahn concurred with these points.
It is worth bearing in mind that there continues to be an attempt to
demonize crypto by way of 911, that punks and nerds are likely
targets, that there may be re-institution of crypto control measures,
despite Levy and Kahn disagreeing with that view.
This crypto demonization may well intensify as investigations proceed into the government, military and intelligence failure to prevent 911. Whether crypto actually played any role in the attack may be seen as unimportant so long as a convincing
story can be promoted that it must have been.
On the British predecessors: it remains to be seen how much
of their work was leaked to Diffie. We've got an FOIA request
into NSA on this topic, now two years old, and have been
told by NSA that it has material from the date of the British invention. No work on when or what will be released.
Tim is right that Diffie, Hellman, all the PK early developers,
deserve all the credit for making PK public and the British
deserve none for their compulsive secrecy. And it may be
only academic as to who invented PK. Still, it is worth learning
what the possibilities are for attacks on PK, especially in the
light of its unparalleled reputation for public use, or, as
David Kahn said, its value as "the single most important
invention in the history of cryptography."
That sort of language makes me nervous about what lurks
in the heart of PK, its invention, its leak, its liberation, its
widespread public use, its seeming impregnability. A fair
amount of the reputation of PK is comparable to a sophisticated
sting -- the kind Kahn richly documents throughout the history
of cryptography.
If liberation of cryptography is a sting, what role of cpunks
in that? What role vainglory in falling for the allure of anti-
authority as the sting unfolds. Levy has words about this,
although I have no reason to believe his early vaunting of
cypherpunks was part of a wider scheme, nor his recent
book. But, still, wizened cryptographers, as Kahn documents,
claim you cannot ever be too paranoid.
Whatever NSA releases on pre-Diffie PK, it will not be
the truth but probably convincing to the believers in fairy
tale crypto protection. The Brits way of leaking PK history to accomplish a hidden task or ability is similarly suspicious.

Psychological and psychiatric catergories are entertaining to

illusory supremacy.
Fortunately, there are numerous creative alternatives to rigid, authoritarian language as in all arts and sciences. Alternatives which the conventionally obedience ever attempt to demonize and castigate with simian terms of opprobrium. Psychoanalysis a prime tool, literary

Agreed, that is what distinguishes this list, now, and based on the
archives, from its beginning. While Tim used miswiring coyly, the
term fits most of what produces innovative stuff in human affairs.
The wired, no pun Declan, just repeat, exploit, copy, plagiarize,
steal, and claim as their own what the miswired originated, again
as evidenced here but hardly only here.
And the wired are forever proclaiming the need for more innovation,
but when they attempt to demonstrate what they mean, all too
often it is very slyly repackaged fruit cultivated by, ahem, nobodies.
Reputation is an obession with the wired, knowing as they do that
without that they are nothing.
So they must erect fantastic images of themselves, constantly
culling their output for new ways of packaging it; they must destroy
whatever innovation puts their reputation at risk; they must band
together to promote each other's brand; and they must ever be
alert for threatening other totems and taboos which diminish
their own voodoo.
The wired are pathetically traditional, are addicted to pantheons
of heros, fear genuine novelty, vainly struggle to impose their carapacial vision on reality to hide their dread of the unknown.
The love special connections to others like themselves, a web
of trust, a secret, exclusive web is best of all (though cloaked
with a scrim of openness).
Miswired, yeah, that's the the true cypherpunk waywardness, and within that open-minded ambience a few self-filtered, -censored wired are tolerable to remind what not to do, how not to be, what not to say, who not to hang with, who to be kindly to despite the deliberate self-incapacitation to avoid

affairs so they can play at defying them in an approved

An anonymous ISP representative responds to "ISPs Not Filtering Viruses:"
A major US ISP which is a subsidiary of a foreign corporation hosts a US government operation to monitor *all* traffic handled by the ISP at a central network operations center. This operation was set up as a condition for the foreign corporation to acquire the ISP and as far as known is not the result of a court order. No officer or employee of the foreign corporation or the ISP subsidiary has access to or control over the operation. Traffic
is monitored by personnel who have security clearances for handling confidential information acquired by monitoring. Streaming data may be searched for key words or other information, collected and transmitted to the sponsoring agency
for analysis and evaluation.
The representative claims that another US government surveillance activity set up after September 11 is for ISPs to host sites set up to offer information likely to be sought by terrorists, such as detailed airline schedules or other dangerous information. The logs of access to these sites are copied to CDs daily and sent to the supervising agency. ISP personnel are forbidden to monitor the sites or examine the logs. Numerous US ISPs are allegedly involved in this activity. As far as known this activity is not the result of a court order.
Cryptome would appreciate learning more about such non-court-ordered governmental Internet monitoring for publication. In particular, leads on information on the central monitoring operation at the foreign-owned ISP -- which sounds like a description of Verio, Cryptome's host, now owned by Japan's NTT Corporation. At the time of NTT's purchase of Verio, there were news reports
of FBI objection to the sale unless arrangements were made to prevent foreign espionage and to avoid interference with lawful interceptions.

misinformed, allegedly in the national interest.
7. The US lacks a mechanism such as the British Parliament to question its
ruling Taliban; the media claims this role for itself but does not do what it
is specially privileged to do, particularly in times of war and variations on
alleged national emergencies, primarily because much of the media is
organized to distribute simple-minded entertainment matters based on
a flood of custom-made delivery mechanisms -- press releases, conferences,
salons, din-dins, retreats, pillow talk, temporary service in minor roles in government and study groups.

rare cases of original research, and even then, until the research is
valorized by media coverage nobody pays attention to it.

Socialism in the US, and elsewhere, transmogrified into other movements which adopted some of its aspects and mixed them

was such a mongrel itself, as was and is, capitalism. Hardly
a political ideology is not an opportunistic blend of what will
work, and which will evolve in a winning direction, hopefully.
Capitalism is infused with socialist benefits for its practitioners,
and democratic socialism pervasive in Europe is infused
with luxurious elitism which favors those who enjoy heirarchies.

a rejection of all ideology while gobbling among the
garbage heap of ideology for bits and pieces to confect
a seemingly unique brew of convictions which when examined
shows nothing more than what ignorance can engender in the

Bear in mind that the holders of US debts do not want the debts
paid, only the interest, and in fact want both to increase as they
have consistently since the US government went into hock.
A prime reason holders of US debt fear other countries defaulting
on their debt is that that might become a promising political campaign
in the US where debt of all kinds are glorified and where unpaid debts
are the greatest sins so long as the debts are owed by the USG and
credit card, family home and car, debtors.
Gigantic debts by well to do are signs of accomplishment and no
wealthy person wants to be large-debt-free. Instead what is wanted is
a top-notch credit rating, that is desirable to be an debtor who can
call for whatever is needed at the moment without expending the
small amount of cash on hand, which is called pocket change.
The biggest debtors are the super rich, and their combined debts
exceed that of the US Government. Such debts are customarily
called investments purchased with borrowed money or other
forms of investments. These superwealthy schemes based on
superimpositions are very large Ponzi schemes, nearly all of which rely up government underwriting either by permissable
law or by assurance of bail-out -- not surprisingly as a last
resort to claim national security is at stake, or even less
surprising, require war to thin the complainers of small
debts and to boost war industry replenishment of large
fortunes. Nothing peculiar about the US doing this, for it
is what governments were invented for: to assure continued
well-being for the favored while promising a chicken in every
for the starving and promising as well that the starving must
work for the chicken freely stolen by the wealthy.
Capitalism didn't begin this dreadful state of affairs, it merely
copied more brazen versions and cloaked its intentions with
simulated democracy, sometimes smirkingly called free market forces by its beneficiaries. Getting the small debtors to lust after Wall Street is  nothing compared to getting them drunk with patriotism so they'll send their idiot off-spring to kill those hungry like themselves while George slurps Hagen-Daas from Condi's navel.
The key to success is getting the really smart hungry people
to feed your mind and gut and wipe your ass while believing like national security teams they are really in charge. How do you
do that? The successful claim it was hard work and luck, and
anyone can do it. Haw. Haw. Haw.

Revisions and Clarifications to Encryption Controls in the Export

Part 2 (``Information Security''), of the Wassenaar Arrangement List of
Dual-Use Goods and Other Technologies
SUMMARY: This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
to reflect changes made to the Wassenaar Arrangement List of dual-use
items, and to update and clarify other provisions of the EAR pertaining
to encryption export controls. Consistent with the Wassenaar changes,
Note No. 3 (``Cryptography Note'') to Category 5--part II (Information
Security) of the Commerce Control List (CCL) is amended to allow mass
market treatment for all encryption products, including products with
symmetric algorithms employing key lengths greater than 64-bits, that
previously were not eligible for mass market treatment. As a result,
for the first time, mass market encryption commodities and software
with symmetric key lengths exceeding 64 bits may be exported and
reexported to most destinations without a license under Export Control
Classification Numbers (ECCNs) 5A992 and 5D992, following a 30-day
review by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) (formerly the
Bureau of Export Administration (BXA)). In addition, this rule, for the
first time, allows equipment controlled under ECCN 5B002 to be exported
and reexported under License Exception ENC. For all other information
security items, including encryption source code that would be
considered publicly available, this rule updates and clarifies existing
notification, review, licensing and post-export reporting requirements.
Restrictions on exports and reexports of encryption items to terrorist-
supporting states (Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and
Syria), their nationals and other sanctioned persons (individuals and
entities) are not changed by this rule.
DATES: This rule is effective June 6, 2002.

Militia members and Al Qaeda members are remarkably similar. Both are galvanized by religious extremism (America's militias overlap with the Christian Identity movement, which preaches that Jews are the children of Satan and that people of color are sub-human), both see the United States government as utterly evil, and both are empowered by the information revolution that enables them to create networks, recruit disciples and trade recipes for bio- and chemical weapons.
It would be a mistake to put one's faith in the militias' eternal incompetence. Jessica Stern of Harvard has written about an anti-government activist named James Dalton Bell, who earned a degree in chemistry from M.I.T. and is unquestionably brilliant. By age 14, he says, "I was studying the isomerization of benzyl thiocyanate to the isocyanate."
Weren't we all? But Mr. Bell, who is now in jail, is also believed by the authorities to have manufactured sarin, a nerve gas, in his basement. He led a chemical attack against an I.R.S. office and wrote an Internet book called "Assassination Politics," which outlines a very clever scheme to pay for contract killings of federal officials with digital cash in a way that preserves anonymity at both ends. There is also evidence that Mr. Bell talked "hypothetically" of poisoning a city's water supply.

I appreciate what an honorable ISP admin will do to abide customer
rights over intrusive snoopers and perhaps cooperative administrators
above the pay grade of a sysadmin. Know that a decent sysadmin is on for about 1/3 of a weekday for 24x7 systems is a small comfort but
leaves unanswered what can happen:
1. During that time when a hero is elsewhere.
2. Upstream of the ISP, the router of the ISP and the nodes serving
routers, as well as at a variety of cache systems serving there various
3. At major providers serving a slew of smaller ISPs. In this case I
reported a while back of a sysadmin telling what my ISP, NTT/Verio,
is doing at its major node in Dallas: allowing the FBI to freely scan
everything that passes through the Verio system under an agreement
reached with NTT when it bought Verio.
No matter what a local sysadmin does with data, it remains very
possible that data is scanned, stored and fucked with in nasty ways
coming and going such that no single sysadmin can catch it.
End to end crypt certainly could help but there is still a fair abount
of TA that can be done unless packets are truly disintegrated and/or
camouflaged at the source before data leaves the originating box.
Pumping through anonymizers, inserting within onions, subdermal pigging back on innocuous wireless packets of the financial advisor

{ask,mityagin,shamir} Abstract. In this paper we analyse the security of a new key exchange
protocol proposed in [3], which is based on mutually learning neural networks. This is a new potential source for public key cryptographic schemes which are not based on number theoretic functions, and have small time and memory complexities. In the first part of the paper we analyse the scheme, explain why the two parties converge to a common key, and why an attacker using a similar neural network is unlikely to converge to the same key. However, in the second part of the paper we show that this key exchange protocol can be broken in three different ways, and thus it is completely insecure.   3.

Thomas Friedman in the New York Times today:
Webbed, Wired and Worried, May 26, 2002
I've been wondering how the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were looking at the 9/11 tragedy; whether it was giving them
 any pause about the wired world they've been building and the assumptions they are building it upon. In a recent visit to Stanford University and Silicon Valley, I had a chance to pose these questions to techies. I found at least some of their libertarian, technology-will-solve-everything cockiness was gone. I found a much keener awareness that the unique web of technologies Silicon Valley was building before 9/11 -- from the Internet to powerful encryption software -- can be incredible force multipliers for individuals and small groups to do both good and evil. And I found an acknowledgment that all those technologies had been built with a high degree of trust as to how they would be used, and that that trust had been shaken. In its place is a greater appreciation that high-tech companies aren't just threatened by their competitors; but also by some of their users.
It was part of Silicon Valley lore that successful innovations would follow a well-trodden path: beginning with early adopters, then early mass-appeal users and finally the mass market. But it's clear now there is also a parallel,
criminal path: starting with the early perverters of a new technology up to the really twisted perverters. For instance, the 9/11 hijackers may have communicated globally through steganography software, which lets users e-mail, say, a baby picture that secretly contains a 300-page compressed document or even a voice message.
"We have engineered large parts of our system on an assumption of trust that may no longer be accurate," said a Stanford law professor, Joseph A. Grundfest. "Trust is hard-wired into everything from computers to the Internet to building codes. What kind of building codes you need depends on what kind of risks you thought were out there. The odds of someone flying a passenger jet into a tall building were zero before. They're not anymore. The whole objective of the terrorists is to reduce our trust in all the normal instruments and technologies we use in daily life. You wake up in the morning and trust that you can get to work across the Brooklyn Bridge -- don't. This is particularly
dangerous because societies which have a low degree of trust are backward societies."
Silicon Valley staunchly opposed the Clipper Chip, which would have given the government a back-door key to all U.S. encrypted data. Now some wonder whether they shouldn't have opposed it. John Doerr, the venture capitalist, said, "Culturally, the Valley was already maturing before 9/11, but since then it's definitely developed a deeper respect for leaders and government

the rise in military actions, redefining product lines, digging

up the picayune Palestinian dust-up to a global affair,
as he has tried futilely to do for years but failing due to
the required emphasis on its Jewish attribute for the
New York City readership yet paying the price of indifference
Friedman regularly these days predicts a series of suicide
bombings in New York City, and as a sidebar elsewhere in
the US. That police scale he is good at, but the military
scale of widespread carnage appears beyond his comprehension --
in the spirit of the once-isolated and comfortably insulated USA.
The problem with dismissing the drumbeat of terrorist alarms
is that the guardians could well let a few attacks happen to show
the citizenry the neeed to show respect for government. This is
not to suggest that 9/11 was such an attention-getting operation
but it certainly has fulfilled the dreams of those who warned
about it and are now reaping its benefits -- gov, mil, com and edu.

@_subject: TIA presentation 
These remarks in the House on November 22, 2002:
  Mr. INSLEE. Mr. Speaker, today the United States
Congress will send to the desk of the President of the United States for his signature, the Homeland
Security bill. This bill will create the Department of Homeland Security, an
agency charged with safeguarding Americans and the American way of life.
  When enacting this bill, we must be careful not stray into invading American's privacy when using the regulatory tools provided for in this bill. I refer specifically to the vague authorizations in this bill that would give this new Federal agency broad authority to push the privacy envelope.
  Section 201, paragraph 14, charges the Under Secretary for Information Analysis and
Infrastructure with the responsibility of establishing a secure communications and information technology infrastructure that specifically authorizes the use of `Data-mining.'' Since ``Data-mining'' has no statutory definition, I am concerned that we have not adequately established that the Department of Homeland Security does not have the green light to adopt an all encompassing program that invades the privacy of every American without their permission or knowledge. We were recently notified that former Rear Admiral John Poindexter is developing a Total Information Awareness program to monitor the everyday transactions of Americans. We cannot allow this to happen.
  I do not believe that this statutory language is meant to allow the Federal Government to obtain whatever list, public, private, or commercial, to profile Americans. It is clear that the American public does reject this approach, as they soundly voiced their outrage for other privacy-eroding proposals such as the FBI's ``Carnivore'' system, and the Department of Justice ``TIPS'' program. It is vital that this body adopt standards to define such terms as ``data-mining,'' and to do so early in the 108th Congress. I thank the   Mr. ARMEY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud that the House is today sending H.R. 5005, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to the President. It is an important step forward in the defense of the nation.
  I would like to take this opportunity to discuss a few items of interest in the bill as amended by the Senate.
  First, Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the privacy concerns that have been raised recently about provisions in the Homeland Security bill.
  Le me be clear. This bill does not in any way authorize the Department of Defense program knows as ``Total Information Awareness.'' It does not authorize, fund or move into the Department anything like it. In fact, this
bill provides unique statutory protections that will ensure the Department of Homeland Security could never undertake such a program.
  Section 892 of our bill prohibits the sharing of any information that would undermine the statutory and constitutional protections of citizens. We also create a privacy officer, the first ever established by statute, whose sole mission will be to ensure that programs like TIA never get off the ground in this Department.
  Our bill contains provisions that discontinue two programs that raise the very concerns that TIA has raised. We stop Operation TIPS, and ensure that nobody will use this bill as an excuse to implement a National ID card.
  So the legislative intent of this bill is unmistakable. This department must
protect the civil liberties that we all cherish.
  I would like to further make it clear that references in the bill to data-mining are intended solely to authorize the use of advanced techniques to sift through existing intelligence data, not to open a new method of intruding lawful, everyday transactions of American citizens.

[Excerpt. There are 15 images in the patent.]
Anonymity Server, May 14, 2002
1. Field
The present invention relates to the field of communications. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for maintaining anonymous and traffic analysis resistant communications over a communication link.
2. Related Art
Over the last few years, personal and commercial usage of the Internet has increased dramatically. As a result, companies are beginning to monitor such usage for a number of reasons. For example, marketing companies can analyze Internet traffic in order to develop consumer profiles of various users or to obtain information about ongoing projects by a competitive company.
In an attempt to thwart data collection through traffic analysis and provide message anonymity over public communication links like the Internet, anonymous remailers are now being provided. An "anonymous remailer" is a computer that
receives an electronic message over a communication link from a sender and redirects that electronic message to an intended recipient. By encrypting audible and/or viewable data of the electronic message, the integrity and confidentiality of that data would be protected against unauthorized access
by the operator of the anonymous remailer or an interloper.
It is evident that the above-described conventional communication scheme would substantially ensure the preservation of the integrity and confidentiality of data within an electronic message. However, this conventional communication scheme fails to protect the integrity or confidentiality of data transmitted back to the original sender in the form of a response from the intended
In certain situations, anonymous remailers have been configured to assign a unique tag to each original sender of an electronic message before the electronic message is redirected to the intended recipient. This tag is used as a secret key by the intended recipient to encrypt data contained in a response to the electronic message. However, to support this communication scheme, the anonymous remailer would have to decrypt the response with the
tag and re-encrypt the response with the public key of the original sender because the intended recipient would have no knowledge of the original sender, namely a public key of the original sender. Since the operator responsible for the anonymous remailer would have access to the return path of the response, reliance on the integrity of that operator is required. Clearly, this substantially reduces the level of *security* of this communication scheme.
Therefore, it would be desirable to create an electronic system and a corresponding method for maintaining anonymous and traffic analysis resistant communications over a communication link without dependence on the integrity of the system operator.

more accurate than the journo-school-stylized reporting.
Fiction, advertising, was invented to gloss "non-fiction" until it was found more successful to reverse the osmosis. Headlines, bylines, lead syntactic paragraphs, reliable sources, eyewitneses, the artful couture of dissimulation, padding, shaping the substance to fit the consumer, at the executive level, National Intelligence.
The NYT, for one, heavily loads its 3rd page with lingerie ads when the front page is grimmest. Brits, more civilized, lead with tits and ass, with news positioned later where it belongs among

There was more fighting and carnage in Gulf War 1 than this
piddling latest. This was not a war but a training exercise, a
rattling of sabers, gunboat diplomacy.
The military provided more information in Gulf War 1 than all
the embedded and free-lancers in the latest. Almost no gunship
videos and bombs hitting targets compared to GW1, while the
US was smothered with talking heads doing not much different
than they did in the studio.
The videos in Baghdad showed kiddie versions of Iraqi defenses lighting up the sky, just boring shots of a few vehicles moving
as if there was nothing much going on. No cowering journalists, breaking glass, running for the basement.
If you wanted to kill reporting you could hardly have done better
than putting the mouthpieces in the field far from the bombing,
and mostly away from the diddly shit combat.
The purpose of the war seems to be to scare the bejesus out of
likely targets, a display of power a notch or two above a war game,
but nothing as thrilling as a movie -- which are showing more
warporn and gore than was shown in GW2.
The attack on WTC and the Pentagon was much superior politics,
theater, diplomacy, art, entertainment, grief, shock and awe.

The alarm and security specialists we've talked to claim the
greatest threat to systems are authorized users: the property
owners, their children, employees, servants, nearly all of whom
fail to arm and disarm the system properly not matter how
carefully instructed. A false alarm is feared by these users more than an attacker, for they are more often traumatized by an errant signal, and the outpouring of security personnel and police, than by an actual attacker. (Like the US security and law enforcement systems.)
The security responders are so pissed, or so condescending, that the users are in a state of panic about the systems going off falsely. Answer to that is to leave the system off. And claim they forgot to arm it. Thus, self-censorship to keep the cops
from attacking.
Then there are panic room backups which freak the users due
to its capability of killing them with false threats like the gentleman, Safra, was killed on the Mediterranean coast when he believed
he was under attack as responders tried to rescue him. Responders
are a genuine threat when they think you are an AIDS carrier.
It's worth keeping in mind, that protective and security systems
can do you great harm, like friendly fire and security agencies of
all kinds -- banks, doctors, accountants, in-house guards, most

Jessica Stern's new book, "Terror in the Name of God : Why
Religious Militants Kill," has about 8 pages on Jim Bell, in
a chapter called "Lone Wolf Avengers," which is shared with
the Pakistani Kansai, assassin of CIA employees.
Stern says that while Bell is not a religion-based terrorist
he is included in the book as an example of the solo individual
with a private agenda that smacks of religion. This appears to be a stretch, but Stern stretches her material to fit an agenda.
A Stern footnote says the Bell material is based on the
forthcoming publication, "James Dalton Bell." She says
she had numerous telephone interviews with him beginning

Endeavors which require close, sustained concentration and logical methodologies seldom help with challenges which require noodling, free-form creativity, openness to disagreement, compromise. And vice versa.
Disaster looms when a logical minded person gains political power and sets out to arrange a nation into a perfect society as if a machine for sharply controlled output. And vice versa when a muddled-headed dreamer sets out to design and manufacture physical structures.
Yet again and again this happens: logical nuts get into positions of political power -- left, right and center, anarcho and theological -- and all to often millions suffer, and multi-thousands are murdered. Or an all-loving putz so narcotizes adherents to believe heaven on earth is at hand that mass suicide occurs, not least by letting a logical nut annihilate the willing victims.
Cluelessness abounds, not only on cpunks but in all fields, almost as commonplace as clueless flaming. Flaming the clueless is perfect proof that flamers are no wiser than those they mimic.

The rights of property owners, especially commercial property,
are not as absolute as sometimes argued. Due to the public
services provided by governmental authorities, tax perqs not
the least, property owners are required to abide a diverse range
of laws and regulations to provide assurance that people on the
property are safe. These people include the property owner,
family members, employees, customers and others who may
not be capable of judging what is safe.
Similarly, retail property owners are obliged to provide assurances
to customers that they are safe as prescribed by zoning, building
and health codes. To be sure there is a lucrative industry of professionals who advise property owners how to skirt these
requirements -- public relations mongers, lobbyists, lawyers, zoning consultants, architects, engineers, planners, politicians, so-called public interest groups, bribers, liars, cheaters, the mob, whores, pimps, and so on. Most of these are lightly or unregulated, even those ostensibly licensed to protect the public interest are
happy to front for those whose only interest is criminal profit.
Keep this in mind: whenever someone argues for the right to
do what they want on their property they are blowing shit in your
face while picking your pocket and placing you and your beloved
mongrels in danger through a smart-ass range of distancing, exculpatory
mechanisms, not least several of the constitutional amendments which were set up for just that purpose by the original continental
landscape thieves and which are forever being updated to keep the our-screw-you-laws-are-fair-laws racket running smoothly. Thanks to two centuries of warping law and culture to bias stolen

Patent Abstract
The Spread Spectrum Image Steganography (SSIS) of the present invention is a data hiding/secret communication steganographic system which uses digital imagery as a cover signal. SSIS provides the ability to hide a significant quantity of information bits within digital images while avoiding detection by an observer. The message is recovered with low error probability due the use of error control coding. SSIS payload is, at a minimum, an order of magnitude greater than of existing watermarking methods. Furthermore, the original image is not needed to extract the hidden information. The proposed recipient need only possess a key in order to reveal the secret message. The very existence of the hidden information is virtually undetectable by human or computer analysis. Finally, SSIS provides resiliency to transmission noise, like that found in a wireless environment and low levels of compression.

An odd aspect of the Stakeknife revelation is that the prime
candidate for outing Stakeknife, an undercover agent pseudonymed
"Kevin Fulton," has had his true name on Cryptome for several months on court claims made against HMG for compensation
for years of undercover spying and the death of his stillborn
daughter allegedly caused by a security raid:
  "Kevin Fulton" is known to a number of British and Irish reporters
but none have published his true name, although the Scottish

the true name of the claimant.

was published -- not first by Cryptome as some newspapers have
said but by Scottish and Irish newspapers (Cryptome was alerted
and grabbed the stories the night of May 10).
Fulton has received several bullets indicating he will be killed for
revelations about what he learned during his undercover work,
has applied for a gun permit, and the police have refused to
grant the permit.
Fulton is one of a group of 12 former undercover agents who are

I was expecting someone else at about the same time. True, I could
have refused entry after the agent showed his ID. However, it
seemed too good an opportunity to pass up: it is pretty common
for Cryptome to get unexpected contributions. We try to remain
open lines of communication to unknown sources, if not a goodly
amount of info would never come out way.
For all I knew, and now know, the Special Agents were frauds,
of which Cryptome gets a taste regularly, perhaps more than
we know. As discussed here, spoofing is trivial to do.
Toward the end of the visit I asked SA Kelly to see his ID up close
and he displayed a wallet with a brass badge on the left and a
two-leaf ID on the right: flip left, then flip up. Was it real?
The two-leaf ID looked like the version SA Renner showed at
the door.
Trim haircuts and dark suits, healthy-looking young Caucasians,
no facial hair, shined shoes, clean teeth, no noticeable mouth or body odor, no obvious weapon bulges, polite, actually not
polite all the time: there were a few instances when mild
friction occurred, low-key warnings sent my way about
inadvertent threats to the nation with too much information
like that on Cryptome.
SA Renner was cooler than Kelly during questioning -- Kelly slightly bristled when I made a comment about free flowing information making the US stronger, the agent saying, yes, but information can be misused. He bristled a lot more when
I said I would publish their names, "make them famous." At
the word "famous" Kelly said, smiling "really, I haven't had that before."
Renner was quieter on naming names, knowing that there
was a CNN story out about him. But he too mildly protested
with the "hazard to the family" shtick.
Kelly said, "you know we can be found by knowing our
names, get shot for what we do." That reminded me of
Jeff Gordon, but I didn't snort.
Kelly leaned forward in his wing-back chair, slightly aggressive, whereas Renner sat upright at a table, case file in front, posing most of the questions to me.
Now, if I had refused the agents entry could I be telling this
dinky inside story? Perhaps better will be the second visit, or door-busting and marching downstairs in handcuffs, or dark-van-snatch on the street, or my family and customers
and friends questioned and warned, my assets seized
and listed in the New York Times, gosh, what notoriety
being a questionable patriot can lead to -- maybe right
up there at the foot soles of the Special Agents, real or Confirming the allegation about idiot witnesses, I am
sure I would not recognize either agent if I saw them

We've made a few FOIA requests, but none have produced a
flood of paper like that made to the US Army INSCOM for a list
of military intelligence files provided by anonymous, most dating from the 1940s and 1950s but some up to the 70s and 80s.
An aspect of the response has been INSCOM forwarding our request to a host of other agencies which originated certain files: State, Justice, FBI, CIA, other Army sections, Air Force,
Navy, and so on. These have been dribbling in, nearly all
heavily redacted or flat out refused.
A characteristic of the responses has been the labels on
the envelopes: nearly all typed and thereby capable of being
added to, or already entered into, a database on me and
Cryptome. One exception: the FBI, which hand writes the address. Is this due to crappy label printing capability (which we all share) or an attempt to obscure that the address has been, or could
be, put in a data base? Transmittal letters are typed so that means the data has been digitized (or typewriter written), so why else the hand writing? Has the Bureau been sued for digital labelling correspondents?
Do printed labels tell too much about the agency, source of toner,
supplier of fonts and word-processing programs, paper manufacturer,
tiny flecks of skin and/or fingerprints on the label adhesive? Does
hand writing analysis show the origin of the ink, the birthplace and
ethnicity of the writer, her/his state of mind -- on the verge of a
nervous breakdown, ready to kill or leak or go over to the enemy,
sexually drained by bosses horniness, a skinny dreaming of Twinkies -- thus does the laboratory investigate FOIA requests
sent to the FBI directly and more importantly those forwarded
by other the enemy: other agencies spilling the beans about
vast data gathering.

of redacted FBI files, and more coming from their twisted sisters.

State Department Protests Televangelist's Remark
Fri Oct 10,10:48 AM ET
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The State Department has protested to televangelist Pat Robertson about his "despicable" suggestion that someone blow up the department with a nuclear bomb, an official said on Thursday.   Robertson, a former presidential candidate, made the remark in an interview with Joel Mowbray, author of a new book entitled "Dangerous Diplomacy: How the State Department Endangers America's Security." State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, asked to comment, said on Thursday: "I lack sufficient capabilities to express my disdain.
 ... I think the very idea is despicable." The department has made its views clear to Robertson, added a State Department official, who asked not to be named. Introducing Mowbray on his Christian Broadcasting Network, Robertson said that a person who read Mowbray's book would reach the conclusion that a nuclear explosion at the State Department was the best solution. "I read your book. When you get through, you say (to yourself): 'If I could just get a nuclear device inside Foggy Bottom (the State Department's main building), I think that's the answer' and you say: 'We've got to blow that thing up.' I mean, is it as bad as you say?" he said. "It is," Mowbray replied. Mowbray himself did not make the suggestion, either in his book or in the interview. According to the network's Web site, Mowbray's book "exposes the mixed allegiances, hidden agendas, and outright anti-Americanism found in the State Department."

"Instant Ciphertext-Only Cryptanalysis of GSM Encrypted
Communications," by Elad Barkan, Eli Biham, Nathan Keller
    (18 Pages, 234KB)
Abstract. In this paper we present a very practical cipher-text only
cryptanalysis of GSM encrypted communications, and various active
attacks on the GSM protocols. These attacks can even break into
GSM networks that use "unbreakable" ciphers. We describe a
ciphertext-only attack on A5/2 that requires a few dozen milliseconds
of encrypted off-the-air cellular conversation and finds the correct
key in less than a second on a personal computer. We then extend
this attack to a (more complex) ciphertext-only attack on A5/1. We
describe new attacks on the protocols of networks that use A5/1, A5/3,
or even GPRS. These attacks are based on security flaws of the GSM
protocols, and work whenever the mobile phone supports A5/2. We
emphasize that these attacks are on the protocols, and are thus
applicable whenever the cellular phone supports a weak cipher, for
instance they are also applicable using the cryptanalysis of A5/1.
Unlike previous attacks on GSM that require unrealistic information,
like long known plaintext periods, our attacks are very practical and
do not require any knowledge of the content of the conversation.
These attacks allow attackers to tap conversations and decrypt
them either in real-time, or at any later time. We also show active
attacks, such as call hijacking, altering data messages and call

Some of it could be true, but.
Director of NSA shifts to new path
By Scott Shane
Sun National Staff
August 8, 2004  Technology revolution   Given the dire assessments a few years ago, it is notable that Hayden says the communications revolution has on the whole been a plus, not a minus, for the NSA.   The NSA director declines to elaborate. But interviews with outside experts suggest that the agency has managed to overcome the challenges posed by fiber-optic cable and encryption.   "My opinion is that at this point, those are little more than a speed bump to NSA," says Steve Uhrig, president of SWS Security, a Harford County firm that builds eavesdropping and counter-eavesdropping systems for U.S. and foreign police agencies. "They have a virtually unlimited budget, and they can put amazing resources to work on a problem."   Several sources who regularly speak with NSA officials say they believe Uhrig is right. Although they do not know the details, they say the agency has almost certainly managed to tap fiber cables on a large-scale basis, making access to the information inside less of a problem than its overwhelming volume.   The NSA has also found a silver lining to the use of encrypted e-mail: Even if a particular message cannot be read, the very use of encryption can flag it for NSA's attention. By tracking the relatively few Internet users in a certain country or region who take such security measures, NSA analysts might be able to sketch a picture of a terrorist network.   Information 'in motion'   And by focusing their electronic tricks on messages as they are first typed on a computer or when they are read on the other end - what security experts call "information at rest" - NSA technical experts might be able to bypass otherwise-unbreakable encryption used when the information is "in motion."   Meanwhile, the popularity of e-mail and particularly of cell phones has worked to the NSA's advantage in the battle against terrorism.   The NSA's computers can track and sort huge volumes of e-mail far more easily than they can manage telephone intercepts, because text is consistently represented in digital code.   And cell phones - as handy for terrorist plotters as for everyone else - provide not just an eavesdropping target but also a way to physically track the user.   Uhrig, who has installed cellular intercept systems in several countries, says that as cell phones have proliferated, the "cells" served by a tower or other antenna have correspondingly grown smaller. "A big hotel may have a cell for every other floor. Every big office building is its own cell," he says.   Easier tracking   By following a switched-on cell phone as it shifts from cell to cell, "you can watch the person move," Uhrig says. "You can tell the direction he's moving. If he's moving slow, he's walking. If he's moving fast, he's in a car. The tracking is sometimes of much more interest than the contents of a call."

That was a surprise and I missed it. Saw the re-run just
now. Pretty funny, ISTM.
The clip was from an AP TV piece which was taped
just before the recent AP story. One day a still photographer
and video guy came to do a follow-up to a telephone interview
by Tom Hays, the AP reporter. No fanfare like the ABC
News gang. The two were in and out in 20 minutes. Each
carried his own equipment, the TV guy packing a heavy
shoulder camera. No lighting, no rigging, a mic, a recorder,
the camera.
He asked a couple of questions, said just talk, so I did.
He said turn off the radio. Shot the barking carcass. He said
walk down the corridor, don't talk. He shot a couple of scrolling screens, packed up, took off.
The still camera guy was the only journalist over recent
days who showed press ID, wore it around his neck. He was a black man, so it figures. He said, without prompting,
you know it's amazing how people let the press into
their homes and offices, no questions asked. We could
be cops or feds and nobody'd know. He said a couple of
guys showed up at his home while the baby-sitter and
his daughter were alone, had talked their way past the
doorman, said they were cops, but showed no ID. The
baby-sitter said show me ID. The guys said we don't
need to. The babysitter said go to hell and slammed the door. The next day, the photog called the precinct
to see if its cops had come. Precinct said nobody from
here went there, but maybe they were from another
jurisdiction. He said he never learned who they were
or why they came.
A black women reporter came a couple of days ago,
showed no ID but mesmerizing giant hooters in a deep-cut blouse. Don't remember what I told her, her name or
who she worked for. Fought hard to look at her eyes,

The FBI visit took place in November 2003. Here's an account:
The John Stewart piece excerpted an AP-TV clip taped on August 16 which was a supplement to an AP story about FBI
harassment of potential RNC protestors. AP, like ABC News, confused the unrelated November visit with the August RNC visits. What got their attention
were Cryptome's aerials and maps -- red-team exposure
of vulnerabilities around Madison Square Garden, and
our accusation of NYC security by obscurity. No feds or LEs have inquired about those obvious weaknesses.
During interviews we've tried to explain this but that
didn't mean shit to the interviewers who were looking for people to brand anarchists who had been smeared by FBI
visits. Why are you helping terrorists, they chant.
We had no contact with the Daily Show. And didn't use
the term anarchist in interviews although several interviewers
urged it.
We told one interviewer that anarchism was too mild for
our intention to undermine civilization, to rid the earth of
humanity, for the planet to shrivel into nothingness, to
accept that the desire to be god was a useless passion. Oh shit, he said, you're a Sartrean.

Tim has become so proprietary about cypherpunks it's strange
that he's never operated a node himself, or underwritten all of
them in the generous spirit of John Gilmore. Maybe Tim has
been underwriting them quietly and that accounts for his obnoxious bitching when the discourse doesn't go the way
he wants it -- he being a believer in getting good head for
his money, or else, plonk the hoes.
Drug dealers work the same model, as do pimps, and
bandits, and big-shit right-wing thugs CEOs, none of whom love the urchins who drain their pickles, generate their wealth, instead they yarp the Calvinist creed that economic success equates with superior human value, that if you're not wealthy
you're not of much account, rather than admit the evidence that the opposite is most often true, that wealthy people are
some of the dumbest people on earth, fountainheads of
blather, and got to have obsequious minions -- usually (low)
paid, but if not then brainwashed -- on hand at all times to listen to their cantankerous tommyrot fantasies ever-generated to avoid pondering the consequences of their brutish exploitation.
Tim repeatedly abandons cyperpunks when one of his spews
gets dissed. Goes elsewhere looking for admirers or newbies
to pound, and if pounded back, comes back to cypherpunks
to plead to ye old tyme succor, parading his past accomplishments
to see who'll applaud.
Same same same comes out of idlers worldwide, the wealthy
ones the most so. But even welfare cheats talk Tim's talk,
rather Tim whines like welfare cheats, both sharing contempt for people like themselves, but hoping by blaming others their
own shiftlessness will be overlooked.
There are wealthy people who don't suffer Tim's conceited warped
negativizing narcissism. Some of them have supported cypherpunks
with far more than derivative, endlessly recycled opinions and
braggardy. True, these goodhearts are the exception among typically
vile "successful" assholes, but they save the whole rotten barrel of the rich from getting what it deserves.
That is why Tim fears Gilmore's courage, envy.

There's a trial underway in New York City which involves extensive
testimony from the FBI on its means and methods of tapping phone,
fax and e-mail as well as covert video tapping and audio recording
of the three defendants, one of whom is a NYC lawyer, Lynne Stewart,
the other two usual Muslim suspects. The daily transcripts:
A lot of the early proceeding is dry legal maneurvering so you got to dig
for the technical testimony.
One defendant had 85,000 interceptions over several years, and
as intercept systems changed from analogue (Lockheed Martin) to digital (Raytheon) the conversion and archiving process lost a crucial portion of the intercepts, a basis of charges. Defense lawyers are hammering the FBI witnesses on how this could have occurred, and in the process eliciting a good bit of interesting info on the means and methods, as well as the reputation and ability of the witnesses and the Lockheed and Raytheon interception, manipulation
and archiving systems.
Testimony shows that the FBI continues to rely upon service providers
and contractors for the technical intercepts and freely admit that
the bureau could not do it otherwise. What is done with the raw
intercepts afterwards by the FBI collection, analysis and technical
staff in the field and at the Quantico Engineering Research Facility,
meticulously directed by US Attorneys to pick and choose among the data to support the charges, is what the defense is challenging.
At some point the contractors will be called to describe what takes place beyond FBI capability. The prosecution appears not to want
to go there, so accustomed are they to using the FBI as expert
witnesses to set the limits of jury and the public exposure to the possibilities of counter-interception.

@_subject: If You Want to Protect A Security Secret, Make Sure It's   
Despite the long-lived argument that public review of crypto assures
its reliability, no national infosec agency -- in any country worldwide --
follows that practice for the most secure systems. NSA's support for AES notwithstanding, the agency does not disclose its military and
high level systems.
It is likely that these agencies are willing to go along with the notion
of public review to lull users into depending on the systems made
public. If any are breakable, the review will show that, and if the
agencies can break them they need not say squat, merely reap
the benefits of public ignorance and trust in seemingly unbreakable systems, as with Enigma, Crypto AG, and numerous other historical examples David Kahn describes.
Cryptome's FOI request for NSA documents on when and what it learned about public key (non-secret) crypto from the Brits is now 3 1/2 years old. The agency has said it has relevants documents but has not yet released anything, though some $4,000 has been paid for the search. (Last response from NSA: May 23, 2003, a telephone
call from Pamela Philips, FOIA Chief, saying that the request was in the "easy queue," number 45 from the top.)
Whit Diffie has said he got hints of PK, or something like it, at
NSA. It is not clear from his account whether information on
PK was deliberately leaked to him, with or without a restriction
of disclosure, or if the breakthrough was truly a phenomenal private effort of Diffie-Hellman-Merkle.
Consider that intelligence agencies are known to run years-
even decades-long deception operations, especially about
top secret infosec operations, with the goal of deceiving about the strength of infosec systems so that they will be sufficiently
trusted to be widely used. Again, Kahn cites numerous examples of such deceptions.
The reputation of witting and unwitting participants and institutions
are often used to gain trust in these breakable systems. The
weakness of vaunted systems is considered to be more valuable
than their strengths.
It is imaginable that if AES did not exist it would have to be invented
for such a purposed. As with PK, PGP and the notion that public review of crypto is the hen's teeth of assurance.
Until national infosec agencies reveal what they know it does not
seem prudent to to believe conventional wisdom no matter
how often repeated, especially how often repeated. A 100% safe crypto system is never to be believed, isn't that what always accompanies cryptographers' assurances for they
now better than anyone that snake oil is their No. 1 tool.
Snake oil = crypto, which accounts for why the charge is so often hurled. And why snake oil is used to camouflage what is occurring
beneath its contemptible obviousness.

Adi Shamir and Eran Tromer
A powerful method for extracting information from supposedly secure systems is side-channel attacks, i.e., cryptanalytic techniques that rely on information unintentionally leaked by computing devices. Most attention has been focused on electromagnetic emanations, power consumption and, recently, diffuse visible light from CRT displays. The oldest eavesdropping channel, namely acoustic emanations, has received little attention. The following demonstrates some preliminary results in the analysis of acoustic emanations from personal computers, showing them to be a surprisingly rich source of information on CPU activity.

them? Whenever this truth is repeated, first revealed here in 1992 by a person
who worked at Intel in its early days when it was desperate for government
contracts, it is taken to be humorous. The detailed description of the chip broadcasting technology was once retrievable from the cypherpunks archives but the earliest archives have disappeared, possibly with the intent of erasing information on this very topic. The original anonymous explained that Intel was going to be withdrawn as a public company and do only black work for governments, not only
the US. That that is likely to have happened except that a public shell was allowed to continue and succeed as a cover -- early investors were induced to keep this quiet with bountiful payouts, among them former Intel employees.
What remains of this story on the Internet is a bowderlized version of the original truth, sometimes commingled with Tempest apochryphia -- Tempest the fountain head of dissimulation about electromagnetic transmitting technology more fancifully described than told the truth As a corollary AMD is an illusory chip fabricator, set up and fed by Intel to give the appearance of competition. There are others to delude foreign customers into trusting their homegrown.

The US has not won since WW2. Rebellions, now called
terrorist wars, have been far more successful. If you want
to be a winner do not enlist in military forces of states, rather
get a spin contract far from danger, arguing the virtues of
mightily fearsome hardware and sacrificial patriotism.
The US, a hidebound state, engages in limited combat, dithers, gets youngsters killed, parades the funerals and heroes, eventually pulls out, and the apologists for warmongering do their dirty. Still, it can be said of US military might: more servicemen die of military and civilian accidents, ill health, murders and
suicide than in combat. Worse, deaths and maimings from friendly fire and bad medical care, not to say military justice,
remain a high hazard of high technology and a natsec/military
policy of acceptance and/or denial of responsibility for self-
caused casualties and homicidal behavior in abused and
abandoned service members -- Tim McVeigh one of tens
of thousands who attack at home due to momentum rigged
by inept military training and ethics.

On CJ (Carl Johnson) and Jim Bell:
There was a time when the greatest terrorist threat to the
US was located in the northwestern part of the country,
Idaho, Washington State and Oregon, some of California.
Militia the infidels were called.
The US Attorney's Office in Tacoma, WA, was a center
of counterterrorist activity, aided by FBI, Treasury, IRS,
US Marshals, DEA and others.
Jim Bell was twice busted, tried, convicted and jailed, by the
Tacoma USA, for alleged acts against the USG, primarily the IRS, but knowledgeable citizens presume the assault was the result of his essay, Assassination Politics (AP), which descibed a system for anonymous killing of varmints, government officials especially, but not limited to those.
CJ defended Jim with a series of online statements on his
behalf, and for allegedly running an online version of AP.
For this misbehavior he was busted, tried, convicted and jailed,
also by the Tacoma USA.
Jim served his first term, allegedly misbehaved again,
and was sent to jail again, where he remains and continues
to file appeals of his railroading. CJ served a term and is now free, pursuing among other wonders his career as
the King of Country Porn.
Bell and CJ posted regularly to cypherpunks during their
days of pre-jailing, and some of their messages here were
used against them during trial. An agent of the IRS, Jeff
Gordon was a known subscriber of cypherpunks for
the purpose of surveilling members and stashing useful
email evidence to advance his career -- Jeff was indeed awarded honors for his investigation and jailing of the heroes of the revolution. Here's a US Marshal report on Jeff's snooping:
   On November 25, 1997, Inspector Jeff GORDAN with the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) Portland, Oregon, contacted the U.S.
Marshals Service, Tacoma, Washington, regarding an internet
posting he had obtained on this day (see attached).
   On the same date, Deputy U.S. Marshal STEPHENSON contacted
Inspector GORDAN in an attempt obtain further details regarding
the individuals mentioned in the internet posting. Inspector
GORDAN related the following:
   On May 17, 1997, the IRS in Vancouver, Washington, arrested
James Dalton BELL ( for threats, assaults,
obstruction, and intimidation of employees and officers of the
IRS. During IRS's initial investigation of BELL, the IRS
discovered that BELL was associated with the Multnomah County
Common Law Court as well as the author of "Assassination
Politics", an essay that describes and advocates the development
and use of a system to reward people who kill selected Government
employees. BELL was also known to transmit his beliefs via
internet services (see W/WA case    Inspector GORDON indicated that since BELL's arrest his office
has been monitoring internet postings by the Cypherpunks, one of
the groups BELL was known to be communicating with. Many of the
postings are simply communications between members of the group
regarding their dissatisfaction with the Government. Inspector
GORDAN related that this posting was a concern due to the
statement made by the author, indicating that Tim MAY announced
he would be murdering Jim Bell's judge (known to be U.S. District
Judge Franklin BURGESS or Magistrate J. Kelly ARNOLD) on Friday,
at 4;00 p.m.
   Inspector GORDAN indicated that he is not familiar with the
author of the posting, Bad BobbyH, however he was familiar with
Tim MAY. Inspector GORDAN described MAY as being an
anarchist/survivalist who seems to spend much of his time
communicating his beliefs via the internet. According to
Inspector GORDAN, MAY is retired and fairly "well off", making
his fortune years ago by developing computer programs. May also
has a tendency to attempt to "goat" or "bait" law enforcement
officers into taking action and has repeatedly stated he would
shoot any law enforcement officers who attempted to arrest him.
   Inspector GORDAN provided the following information regarding
the individuals mentioned in the posting:
   Timothy C. MAY (DoB: 12/21/51 & SSN: XXX-XX-XXX)
   XXX
   Corralltos, CA 95078
   Robert HETTINGA
   XXX
   Boston, MA 02131
   Inspector GORDAN disclosed that his office is unable to trace
the posting because the address, Robert Heidegger (rh at dev.null),
is false/untraceable.
   On November 25, 1997, U.S. District Judge Franklin BURGESS and
Magistrate Judge J. Kelly ARNOLD were notified by Supervisory
Deputy Glenn WHALEY and Deputy STEPHENSON reference the internet
   A copy of the internet posting was forwarded to FBI Special
Agent Ron Stankye (360) 695-5661.
   Attached is a copy of another posting by the Cypherpunks
previously received on June 23, 1997 regarding Magistrate J.
Kelly ARNOLD.
   If you have any questions regarding this matter, please call
Deputy STEPHENSON at (253) 593-6344.
Several cypherpunks were subpoenaed for the three trials
for eithering hosting the list, being named as correspondents
with Bell and/or CJ, reporting about the two, or allegedly having information about their seditious activity -- then known as tormenting officials eager to boost counterterrorism funding long before the field went ballistic with Homeland
Security golden windfall, praise Allah's generosity.

Fair enough. Canada is a role model for the US, as is the US for
the world: nobody is wanted unless they are willing to pay for the mistakes and messes the locals have made, or best, work for starvation wages, usually off the books, long the prime source of penal-grade labor in the Echelon nations, not to say the, spit, Western and Eastern cultures -- out-sourcing has always been first in line right at home: wives, kids and the invisible caste-classes
who swab your puke and dump your garbage and bail you out of
the drunk tank.
Contamination by settlement of North America (and man-woman
marriage): pay for it, new immigrants (wives and kids), with cheap labor and keeping your thoughts very, very quiet, and don't bitch about master's eccentricities about sex. The first New World, as Old, settlers set these conditions for the natives and for anybody who came afterwards. That's how you succeed in the New Worlds, behave like Calvinist cum Libertarian cum Roman cum Roman Church pretend aristocrats: if you dont'have it you don't deserve it, but you can always steal
it the legal way, stock market and tithe basket, praise Allah for his valorizing wealth as salvation.
But, more of the defense budget goes for clean-up of its messes in
the US than for military health-care and benefits (overseas it has
hardly begun). The clean-up corporations are mostly the same ones which made the messes (this is the pattern since the Revolutionary
War), and they are not doing the job worth a shit, overruns and performance failures as bad as for unworkable but richly bragged-about armaments. If the bitching about contamination gets too loud, why
start another war.
The DC-area is one of the most contaminated parts of the US due to the plethora of toxic-puking mil installations. One of the worst is under American University and surrounding neighborhoods, across Nebraska Avenue from the headquarters of Homeland Security, itself once home of the military's oldest comsec unit.
As sleazy Hitchens and slews of other suck-ups of the rich and powerful have demonstrated, especially those predating from Canada: defend and flatter and amuse the privileged of the US-supremacist model of the New World as if the Old in new clothing, and you'll do quite well. But do not engage in dissent or your product won't move and your wise ass will be banished -- thanks to the scoundrels' patriotism embedded in the capitalist regime since day one.

cases being rescued from an economic slump, and some have

always be insufficient but enough to keep the warring parties
going at it.
To be sure, the US Civil War provided the same beneficence

Historians have noted that Northern generals in particular worked hard to avoid battle while begging for more troops and supplies. Shrewd commentators write there could have been Southern-general complicity in this paradic churning before it got out of hand due to Lincoln demanding action to keep his

no matter their ideology, so it is a surefire way to boost flagging

What is characteristic of all these Bush-winning stories is that
the writers uniformly seem surprised it happened. More surpised

that it is hard to believe by most Americans that Bush seems to have won, if you read the winners and losers accounts carefully.
Wolfe's piece shows the common feature of dumbfoundness,
as if not quite clear how it happened, despite all the cliches being
bruited, especially the one about the Bush campaign reaching all those millions who liked him and what he is doing.
There a nervousness in the winners' stories, an unsureness
that there was a legitimate win, that something might be discovered
to invalidate it, so its best to push the good news before it
evaporates or is transformed into bad news so closely associated
with the Bush administration. The Bush-win proponents sound like they are whistling in the dark. And their whistling keeps getting louder and more persistent and
more hysterical, if you bother to read the anxious urgings Herr Dr. Heidegger is posting here.

The Selective Service website unctuously declares there is
no draft foreseen at the moment and lists defeat of recent congressional efforts to institute the draft. However, it
emphasizes that the agency is required by law to remain
at the ready to immediately institute a draft upon notice.
As part of this responsibility It polls educational instutitions every 18 months requesting updated information on draft-age youngsters who are receiving federal funding, the most
recent of these polls here:
A single harsh attack on US interests could precipitate a draft,
and override public opposition in a flash.
The military has nearly exhausted it National Guard and Reserve
options, and will not give up the long-standing strategic policy
of being able to fight two major wars at once. Thus most military
resources are tied up not in the Middle East but in pre-positioned
locations determined by the 2-wars policy.
Whether the US military should forego its 2-war policy and
use its forces in ways more appropriate to current threats
will be determined by those interest groups who benefit from
the horrifically expensive and magnificently wasteful 2-war Two generations of military personnel have been trained for
the 2-war threat, and almost none have faced actual combat.
This inexperience shows in unconventional warfare. again
and again. Big war planners throw big war resources are
small targets, take the applause for the phony war show,
as in Fallujah, and discount lives lost because the do not
show up on big war statistical-casualties diagrams.
Big wars expect big losses, far more than volunteers can
provide. Indeed, volunteer military personnel -- officers and
enlisted -- are careful to throw conscripts into the breech
as if they are expendable ammunition, the more thrown
the higher the credit obtained in charts of capacity, not
charts of smarts.
Recall Kennedy embraced the counter-insurgent tool with
support for Special Forces, but these forces remain a
marginal part of the military, not least because they do not
require much material and political resouces to do their
duty. Big defense, and never forget, big intelligence to
feed the need for big defense,  are far superior ar generating
contracts, jobs, careers and campaign contributions.
The US is totally addicted to profligate, wasteful ineffective
big war policy, primarily because there is little risk in
parading might, bragging about it, threatening with it, compared to using it. Every application of US military might since WW2 has failed.

I appreciate your valiant if futile effort to defend honorable
militarism, but you appear not to understand that much of current US military doctrine is aimed at terrorizing enemy forces, en masse, into submission, not merely courageously killing each combatant, mano a mano.
Carpet bombing, bunker-busting, cruise missles, stealth
attacks, artillery barrages, and tactical and strategic attacks
with overwhelming forces in multiples of the opposing force, the so-called "shock and awe," are intended to demoralize and terrify the opposition including civilian supporters. These
attacks require little or no courage to execute, for most are
accomplished with stand-off or remote-controlled platforms,
guided by long-radar, GPS, and satellites, systems operated
by clean-uniformed technicians who don't bear personal
arms, even take showers daily and watch TV of their
carnage for entertainment.
This contrasts with the special forces which do aim at
small scale, precision killing, and which does require courage.
Not much of that goes on, way too cheap for the military-
industrial empire which treasures big iron, gigantic iron,
humongous iron, unbelievably expensive metal, costing
millions of dollars per kill, rather imaginary deaths in the
Cold War manner.
Don't mistake the language and literature of war for
the real thing. You find yourself 100 yards from a bomb
blast, and your organs go into shutdown from the
concussion, yours vision blurs, your limbs won't
function, you shit and piss your britches, then another
bomb falls 50 yards away and blood squirts from ears
eyes and gums due to air compression of your veins
and arties, you flop senselessly out of control and
try to cry for momma, no air in your lungs, skin turning
red from heat, then a third bomb hits 25 yards away
and your body begins to come apart from the blast
or being scythed by shrapnel -- if your head doesn't
leave the carcass, it'll be fried by the metal helmet,
your skin will sizzle, boiling blood will spray out
of all your orifices, but you'll not get to appreciate this
sacrifice for your country, you'll be chatting with
your maker, the bodybag team scraping you memorial
into the barbage bag, heading for the flag-draped
Back in the control room which directed the friendly
fire, the boys and girls are whooping at the bomb
pattern, high-fiving and fist knocking at the perfect
fit of thinking machine and killing machine, no risk to the comfy killers manning the mouses, just like the gameboys taught.

Bear in mind that typewrites have been traced by the
minute, unique characteristics of the metal face of character producers, whether lever-type or ball. The FBI has been doing this quite a while.
Micro-forensics of the unique printing mechanism of each
machine is likely possible. Identification in this manner would have nothing to do with toner cartridges or machine numbers, although it would probably take a sophisticated
laboratory to make the match.
As with most intelligence involving technology, it is not
the obvious that reveals but conceals the less than
obvious, at several depths of deception. Software registration numbers don't mean much compared to what is snarfed when you log on to register a product -- not to mention those sneaky handshakes of PKs and TTPs and SSHs and Extra-Secure Certificates.
Take a gander at a Wash Post Op-Ed from a few
days ago that explained what has been explained
years ago on this sacred list about technological
and intelligence deception, in particular the role
of media yokeling the public:
To be sure the Op-Ed, written by someone at MIT's

There were several USG offices in the Twin Towers, some of
them intelligence. In addition, CIA was located in 7 WTC, along with Secret Service and military offices. The military offices
were used as cover for the others. There was far more USG in WTC than in Murrah, and the lesson learned in OKC was no doubt useful to the attackers: collateral hurt to innocents is magnitudes
more powerful than hitting military targets -- that is what
strategic bombing was invented to demonstrate, not to say threatening with WMDs, a practice invented by the US and
which remains its primary defense strategy.
The cause and effect between USG WMD threats and terrorist attacks is yet to be fully admitted outside military circles: the
military accepts that innocents will be slaughtered, and the
winner must slaughter the most. Terrorism to the military is a nuisance even when a few of its troops are picked off.
The losses in Iraq do not even make a blip on expected
casualties of a major war. More military have died in
conventional accidents, murders and suicides around the world than have died in Iraq and Afghanistan. But those in the Middle East have greater utility for the military to boost its suck for more funds and more "our boys and girls"
sacrifice and more bawling in congress and the presidential campaign about protecting the nation, defense cut-back not
even a dream since ever so convienent 9/11.
Murrah bombing helped the battle against homeland militants,
and WTC got the ball rolling for battle overseas.
Who planned them is yet to be revealed, but the usual suspects
don't mean shit.

Brooks on The Lehrer Report last night did indeed go berzerk
in the face of Shield's superior defense of Kerry's reasonable
approach. Brooks repeatedly agreed with Shield's analysis
showing Bush/Cheney was dogmatic, inflexible and incapable
of admitting error, then went on to defend their fundamental
righteousness as being what you have to do to win against
others having the same characteristics.
He said reasonable people like us, meaning the three on the
show, are not typical of those Bush/Cheney are appealing to.
Their base consituency does not want equivocation they want
to be right, and win, no matter what other countries may want.
Brooks conceded that this desire for being a winner take all,
by force if necessary, concealed a fear of being ignorantly
wrong, and that any candidate which exploited this fear by
promising might is more powerful than knowledge and doubt
will do very well.
This argument is made here by James Donald, and before
him, Tim May and groupies.
To be sure the armaments makers aplaud this rock-headedness
of the cowards who always advocate that others die -- preferably
in large numbers -- for the safety of the yellow-striped shickenhawks needing their necks wrung.

There is a decreasing chance the US can apply its military
might to defeat an unconventional enemy. That kind of enemy
is not what long-standing military strategy and most tactics
are aimed at. Rumsfeld was hoping to revise that when yet
one more mighty military war appeared to head off changing
military policy.
The US has demonstrated in Afghanistan and post-Hussein
Iraq that it does not know how to fight unconventionally. That
inability appeared in Korea, then Viet Nam and has been shown
in every combat the US has engaged in since WW 2.
Military professionals know this and are hamstrung by the
narcotic dependency the defense industry and its beneficiaries
has for big iron and every bigger and more expensive platforms.
This has been coupled with gigantism in intelligence, big science
and big technological research advocated and overseen by giant
corporations and institutions. And to gloss this a huge spin
and propoganda machine has been funded to pump up the
threats and the hefty defense tax boondogling.
Special forces and operations were devised to piss-ant an alternative to this spread across the US pork-barrell behemothicism. But they have seldom been applied beyond pinprick displays, with much hoorahing about their stealthy effectiveness: "we can tell you about our successes, only failures make it to the media."
Commentators have noted the corrupting influence of empire
Britain thinking its global navy would assure continuance of
hegemony. The more that conceit was believed the weaker
the military became by its failure to recognize new forms of
warfare and new ways of thinking. That empire was undermined
by non-hegemonic forms of combat and thinking.
The US might get a bye with its arrogant belief in military might
for another generation if its lucky, if unlucky it will not survive this one. Well, parts of it may survive, away from the cities. Imagine
one of the few cypherpunks holed-up in northwest Utah and
one bunkered in Corralito escape the food-and-water-borne President Attila or May?

James A. Donald:
No, not minefields, but a good percentage of Washington's
army and that of the French, were children. Young boys were
taught the art of war as gofers and undercover spies among
the Brits. Some were caught and executed. Others packed
weapons and fought like men who welcomed their foolhardy
bravery when their manly courage withered.
Today, even the US uses children in war, 17 being the minimum age to enlist. Others sneak in by lying about their age, some as
young as 14. Recruiters look the other way when the kids
and their parents lie. Been there, done that. Enlisted in the
army at 15, served months before being kicked out when a
relative ratted on me. Went in again at 17. That was not
uncommon then, and still is not. Good way to get away
from school and fucked up parents who use you like a
beast of burden -- in every age and country.
The military has found that teenagers are better fighters
than those over 21, more malleable, patriotic, healthy, ready
to kill when told it's okay. Older guys and gals think for
themselves too much to charge a machine gun. A kid
thinks life will never end. That's why it's not so hard
to cultivate suicide bombers.
Flying a $50 million plane is a piece of cake, no guts
required. Fuck those stand-off cowards in artillery,
the navy and air force. Grunts younger than 20 are
the universal soldier. Non-caucasians especially.
No need to mention today's Africans, the pre-teens and
teens Mao used effectively, the underage North Koreans in the Korean Conflict, and not least the Amerindians who
taught kids from puberty to make war -- boys and girls.
It is worth pondering that older guys don't like war up
close, in fact the the further away it is the better they
like to promote it with Stallonian filmic ferocity -- witness the current yellow-bellied administration, though hardly the first to cry for war to be fought by disposable youngsters. What older soft-gutted guys in all nations like most is the Wagnerian tragedy, the soap opera sturm and drang, of other people's suffering and death for their loose-screw agenda.

Still, phony Tempest protection is a pretty good business, no

protection: -- here, look at me trying to shield my nonsense.
Several US companies have done quite well selling so-called
NSA-grade Tempest protection, even requiring an export license for the hoakum, in cahoots with the agency which welcomes
the pointers to users.
Joel McNamara's Tempest site has a several references to RF snake oil, some of which appears to be honeypot-grade.
Relatedlhy, we assume that the only reason NSA released to us a batch of Tempest docs was to promote the sale of weak
systems. Docs which describe the truly good protection have
never been released, presuming there is such high-quality of
RF security.
Tempest could be a diversion from more intricate and
interception. Over-confidence in a security system is a bellweather for successful attack.

Patrick Keefe is overly fond of disparaging "conspiracy"
targets, among them John Gilmore, Duncan Campbell,
Wayne Madsen, EPIC, EuroParl members, just about anyone who takes an balanced (!) view of governmental
and corporate malfeasance.
His book may not be TLA-sponsored but it could be read
as an apology for the agencies, despite his avowal of
concern for privacy in these days of overweening calls
for more security.
He repeats, and quotes other characters prattling, the formulaic mantra of how much privacy must be sacrificed for security, a sure sign that security will be favored and that privacy loss will be faux-regretfully mourned, a view
mighty supportive of the TLAs.
This tipping of the discourse toward more security at
the loss of privacy appears to be the raison d'etre of
the book -- not the only one since the security agencies went into a decline with the Cold War winddown, and
then re-surged after 9/11 -- but his is the first to argue
that Echelon and its new domestic offshoots may not be such a bad thing, both overseas and at home, and
that a public debate about them is overdue.

Former Director of NSA Bobby Inman said last week at a public session
that NSA and the FBI seek very different information, that NSA is
happy to get tiny fragments which would be useless to the FBI.
He said digital communications was a godsend for NSA compared
to analogue, for computers can process great amount of digital
data that would remain obscure or unavailable if it was analogue.
He emphasized that content of communications was not what NSA
sought, instead it wanted data about patterns which would help
focus attention on what content needed to be sought by FBI-like
means. And huge volumes of pattern-rich data needed to be
processed, indeed the larger the volume the better the possibility
useful patterns could be determined. A few focussed calls
such as the FBI seeks would not be helpful to establish patterns.
That is why he said the FBI did not know what to do with the
large number of leads provided to it by NSA, that the FBI was
correct that the diverse range of tidbits had no meaning to them
with the procedures for evidence gathering and prosecution
to which they trained and for which they are regulated.
Inman said NSA is focussed on warning of threat to the nation
not crime-busting, and that for this reason the slightest of data
can turn out to be important if it is correlated with other bits and
pieces. And this requires capacity for gathering, analyzing,
correlating and judgment-making that the military -- with large
number of satellites, antennae, computers, algorithms and
databanks as well as people to operate the apparatus -- alone
has. Nobody else in government or outside it can do this.
That a series of DIRNSAs have made this compelling case
for the need for a topnotch, near-infallible warning system to
a series of presidents and overseers. Inman readily admitted
that when he was head of NSA he "did not have the vision to
anticipate an attack like 9/11." And that he believed the nation
was still at high risk for a repeat.
Not many presidents could resist this argument, nor could
many corporations should they have been trusted enough to
be told what a few in government were told.
Inman said the FBI was good at what it does but it was clueless
about what NSA does. And NSA is not going to tell the FBI, which
leads to nasty blow-ups.
What remains is what DoJ is told about NSA's activities. Inman
agreed with other panelists that DoJ will write a legal justification
for whatever it is told. Sure, a few DoJ lawyers will refuse, but there
are many others who will do it. Just as there are differences in
DoJ, there are differences in NSA about complying with law
governing surveillance, and at the present time newcomers are
eager to skirt the law oldtimers, burned by the 1970s investigations,
are scared shitless to break.
Hayden is not with the old-timers because failure to warn of 9/11
was the greatest NSA failure ever -- CIA on the sidelines but taking
the hit. Inman said he would probably do what Hayden did faced
with the same circumstances.
Inman said in response to an audience challenge that he believed
in covert surveillance, "I've saved lives with it, the nation needs it."
He emphasized, however, that oversight was essential to preserve
democracy, and the FISA needs to be rewritten to fit today's
enemy. He said he helped write the original FISA, all done in
secret. He was not sure how open the rewrite could be, and
he was troubled by the lack of intelligence oversight.

One type of activity NSA needs to trace above all else, perhaps more
than military threats, are financial transactions, and it is these
types most fiercely protected against government access, whether
business to business, person to person, org to org, and most especially
financial op to financial op, the latter not limited to regulated banks.
And no type of enterprise has the resources to giver NSA a run for
its money in long-time, maybe forever, in concealing where the
money is and where it is going and so the struggle goes between
the two biggest consumers of comsec products, hardware and talent,
along with and outpouring of dire threats and assured security.
Deception in financial transcriptions is a given, as with spying, no
the huge effort to trace them by the revenuers, competitors, and
and private spies.
Off the radar, off the grid, off the earth, financial transactions
are larger and more resourceful than all the governments combined.
It is far easier to track military developments than where the money
flows or is stashed or obscured by encryption and false tracking
The steady promulgations of DoJ and the slew of financial crimes
task forces indicate the visible tip of the iceberg; what is exceedingly
hard to penetrate is the underside side of it.
To be sure, if it was admitted that NSA was most interested in tracing
financial transaction data, say to hand over to IRS, FBI and Justice,
that might scare Americans, particularly American businesses with
global customers good and evil, more than diddly-squat mining of
phone data (although some of the consumer chatter might reveal
clues about lesser known ways to transfer money, say, coded signals
sent to order what to do for who).
If NSA was to be confirme as a money cop far more adept and armed
than IRS and FBI the wealth flight to more lenient havens might shake
the foundations of democracy far more than knowing who is calling who.
It was not for a petty protection of US Persons that NSA was formerly
banned from telling other parts of the government what it was
That was the consumer cover story.
Wonderfully strange about the dramatic increase of FBI investigation
of official corruption following the dropping of the ban on sharing
data. Whether any of that was part of the flood of NSA data the FBI
bitched about being worthless is thrilling to consider.
If the PATRIOT Act leads to cleaning up government and business
that would be justice.
In contrast, other nations are deeply concerned, as with Echelon, that
using the terrorist rationale NSA has boosted its collection financial
data on business, persons and governments, pushing the frightened
toward US financial sanctuary, while public attention is diverted with
wails about invasion of personal privacy -- which to these nations means
nothing more important than financial secrecy about cheating, lying,
robbing, sweetheart government contracts, evasion of taxes. With
the Swiss armtwisted into ratting on its banking customers, where
can an evildoer or goodheart find a trusworthy ATM which does not
databank everyone.
We learned today of the Journalist Visa required by the US from
one who has just come here from Italy, more restrictive than for
an ordinary citizen on a visit. With this prejudicial practice the US
joins the select freedom of speech rascals Russia and China.
Is that special visa legit, and if so, what regulates the practice
to demonize the press as if spies.

Wasn't it pointed out quite a while ago, here if no where else, that all digital communications and data were susceptible to covert "radiological tagging," including those encrypted? I don't recall what protection
against that was proposed or developed, but it was seen to be
so likely that countermeasures were essential, but not necessarily
to be disclosed publicly any more than your passphrase.
Now it is always hard to tell what are spoof vulnerabilities, disinfo,
and real ones, but spoof almost certainly outnumber the real
ones for that is a common offense against attackers: to cloud
clear and obscure vulnerabilities with confabulated clear and
obscure ones.
The way broken security continues in use to mislead those
who are dumbfounded that such cluelessness occurs: to
with the Iran security services continuing to use a cracked
crypto system after news reports about it.
Weak comsec is like orchestrated leaks, fools fall in love
with them, seduced by a belief of superiority and good fortune.
The one about the Russians one-time misuse of a one-time
pad leading to cracking VENOA as if that was all there was
Telegraph hands in the old days were quite good at simulating
hands, and cross-talk in wiring was used to leak believable
information because of the faith the snoopers had that nobody
was aware of the intercepts.
William Arkin listed a few days ago on his Washpo blog some 500 programs in use by US spooks to surveil for threats, and some of those might be more than smoke and sunshine but
most are sci-fi used to promote NSA pantopticonic flim-flam.
The most valuable intelligence is obtained by human betrayal
and the humongous hardware on land, undersea and space which gets credit is an effective cloak. Bribing for info is
still the most cost effective, but the US economy doesn't
benefit from that petty pork compared to big iron on land,
undersea and in space.

Whistleblowers are being whipsawed by allurements to tell all with identity

An underground (black) press is more trustworthy providing you can
tell which are honeypots and fake pederasts and which are willing to
take extreme measures rather than reveal sources. Willingness to go to jail is no longer a reliable test of journalistic reliability, it has
become a promotional gimmick not to be believed. The fashion to "grant anonymity" by the media to whistleblowers presumes
to grant too much authority to the media without it having demonstrated it
is willing to risk as much as the whistleblower -- protect thine own ass

[Excerpt 1]
2. Retention
(S/SI) Foreign communications of, or concerning, United States persons that
are intercepted by the United States Signals Intelligence System may be retained in their original form or as transcribed only:
  (a) if processed so as to eliminate any reference to United States persons;
  (b) if necessary to the maintenance of technical data bases. Retention for
  this purpose is permitted for a period sufficient to allow a thorough
  exploitation and to permit access to data that are, or are reasonably
  likely to become, relevant to a current or future intelligent requirement.
  Sufficient duration may vary with the nature of the exploitation. In the
  context of a cryptanalytic effort, sufficient duration may consist of a
  of time during which encrypted material is subject to, or of use in,
  cryptanalysis. In the case of international commercial communications that
  may contain the identity of United States persons and that are not
  or otherwise thought to contain secret meaning, sufficient duration is one
  year unless the Deputy Director for Operations, National Security Agency,
  determines in writing that retention for a longer period is required to
  to authorized foreign intelligence or counterintelligence requirements; or
[End excerpt 1]
[Excerpt 2]
D. (C) Signals Intelligence: Search and Development.
The United States Signals Intelligence System may conduct search and development activities with respect to signals throughout the radio spectrum under the following limitations:
1. Collection. Signals may be collected only for the purpose of identifying
those signals that:
  (a) may contain information related to the production of foreign
  or counterintelligence;
  (b) are enciphered or appear to contain secret meaning;
  (c) are necessary to ensure efficient signals intelligence collection or
  to avoid the collection of unwanted signals; or
  (d) reveal vulnerability of United States communications security.

Skepticism of the NSA-affiliation list is warranted. Just as much as
skepticism about that NSA and its global ilk have been tapping all international and domestic telecommunications. Nobody believed that was going on, and some ignorant fools still disbelieve, or worse, cannot bear to believe a technology so enjoyable could be so violative.
The telcos have been screwing their customers from day one, so
why would ISPs be any different? The Internet is a spying machine
just like the telecomms and postal services have always been, get used to it, or get over it, or get off it, or give up the addiction.
Lesson One for the conspiracy deniers: The only true conspiracy theorists are the spies, they could not exist unless they kept the
natsec threats and denials achurning.
No infosec system is as effective as promoting that it is safe

widespread communication technology is damn comforting.

Matt's concluding concern that Southwestern Bell's AT&T might have violated the basic privacy promise of the original AT&T by
dancing to NSA's tune, is indeed to be lamented. SW Bell has been cooperating with the Feds from its earliest days, thanks to the vast military array and contracts in its service area.
One might suspect that SW Bell's buyout of AT&T was assisted by
the spies for their own purposes to gain ready access to the
infrastructure through tried and trusted friendlies. NTT's
arrangement for the FBI to grab all its traffic at the Dallas
switch a part of the pattern. And Verizon marches in step,
it too having a central intercept office in the Dallas area,
and half-dozen more in NYC for the perdurable Euro suction.
This is not to say that all defense-fed corporations have not
been equally cooperative whether by economic inducement or
by regulatory coercion. Oh, and patriotism, kachink.

For several years, if not from day one, transoceanic cables are pre-rigged

fiber optic cable is hard to tap. It takes sophisticated equipment but none
that is beyond the spies and telecomms regular capability. Disinfo abounds

US patent 6,285,773 discloses a speaker designed specifically for use in double glazing.
Also interesting, five US patents assigned to CPFilms Inc. (7,405,872, 7,295,368, 7,177,075, 6,891,667, and 6,859,310) contain this golden nugget:
"A flexible transparent sheet made in accordance with this invention may also be used to minimize acoustic transmissions from a building by carefully applying the film to the window with an adhesive while making certain that no visible air bubbles are formed between the flexible sheet and the glazing of the window. The term "visible air bubbles" used herein means air bubbles which are visible without any magnification (i.e., visible to the naked eye). It has been discovered that when the transparent flexible sheet lies over an air bubble, the flexible sheet behaves like the diaphragm of a loudspeaker. This causes unwanted transmission of sound waves. Avoiding these bubbles minimizes the transmission of the sound waves through the window." We add that the glazing must be acoutically isolated from its
frame. Metal frames of windows and doors are very effective transmitters of signal (as well as temperature), either those received from the glass in windows or from spaces directly.
Frames need to be acoustically isolated and thermally
broken. Wood frames are much better for this purpose.
One of the shortcomings of relatively new use of cold-formed
metal studs for exterior walls is that they transmit sound
and temperature far more than masonry, so much so that
green designers recommend that they not be used despite
seeming cost savings.
Metal studs in gypsum board walls are wonderful transmitters,
indeed, the studs and gyp board may act as amplifiers, no
matter the STC rating derived from other characteristics.
Again, wood studs are preferrable, or the metal studs must
be isolated by double layering and gasketing.
Wet wood is a transmitter of signal and temperature, dry wood less so.
There are synthetics and/or composities which can take the place of wood and metal studs. Not yet cheap enough to be
used widely.
Now, metal nails, screws, brackets, masonry reinforcement,
ties, support angles and whatnot still remain a source of signal. High-strength adhesives and isolation devices
improve the resistance to transmittal.
The wondrous materials of the stealth machines may come
into architecture some day, but not soon. Well, maybe the
TLAs are using them in SCIFs, the super-versions.
Bamford's latest book is chock full of nightmare technology
and programs for invasive methods well beyond most of

Conspiring to Defraud the United States
Defendants Aided Wealthy Americans Conceal Assets in
Secret Swiss Bank Accounts
WASHINGTON - Hansruedi Schumacher and Matthias Rickenbach,
both of Switzerland, were indicted today for conspiring to defraud
the United States, the Justice Department and Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) announced. According to the indictment, Schumacher
worked as an executive manager at Neue Zuercher Bank (NZB), a
Swiss private bank located in Zurich, Switzerland. Rickenbach
worked as a Swiss attorney who provided legal advice and services
to U.S. clients. Both are alleged to have aided wealthy Americans
conceal assets and income in Switzerland from United States
According to the indictment, Schumacher and Rickenbach helped
wealthy American clients conceal their assets by establishing
sham and nominee offshore entities to hide their U.S. clients'
assets and income while allowing these clients to still control
the assets and make investment decisions.
The indictment further alleges that Schumacher and Rickenbach
regularly traveled to the United States to conduct banking and
investment activities with their U.S. clients and that when they
traveled they concealed their business activities in the United
States by falsely representing to American authorities that they
were traveling to the U.S. for personal reasons. While in the
United States, the defendants would sometimes bring cash
for their clients.
According to court documents, Schumacher and Rickenbach
aided their wealthy American clients repatriate money back
to the United States using several deceptive means. Schumacher
and Rickenbach helped their clients obtain offshore credit cards
and created sham loan documents. Additionally, Schumacher
and Rickenbach falsified bank documents to generate the
appearance that assets of their U.S. clients belonged to Swiss
citizens, and they falsified documents to disguise their United
States clients' repatriation of offshore funds as inheritances
from foreign citizens.
According to court documents, Schumacher and Rickenbach
discouraged their U.S. clients from voluntarily coming into
compliance in the United States. Instead, the defendants
encouraged their clients to transfer their assets from UBS,
a large Swiss bank, to NZB, a smaller bank in Switzerland.
The defendants told their clients that their assets and
identification would be safer at NZB because they had no
presence in the United States and was therefore less likely
to be pressured by the American authorities to disclose the
identities of their United States clients.

The principal cause of Israeli aircraft crashes are bird strikes which cause way more losses than enemy fire. Israel is located on the main north
south route for birds going and coming between Africa and Europe. Similar
bird routes are around the globe and pose similar hazards, not least from
a crafty attacked who would use them to hide conventional anti-air
swarms of mini-craft.
It has been suggested that a pretty good anti-air campaign against Israel would be swarms of birds blending in and supplementing natural ebbs and flows.
Swarms of mini-drones, the little ones which are unarmed, not much
bigger than a model plane, could be effective against UAVs as well
as full-sized aircraft. These cost a few hundred dollars, and are hard
for radar to distinguish from birds.
There is concern that such mechanical swarms might be used against commercial airliners, with or without camouflaging bird flocks. Some
are very quiet, running on batteries not the customary noisemakers.
Can a disposal drone home in on a soldier's radio signal? Sure, using
the same signal technology as model planes. Call them snipers for
assassination politics.
It is reported that the US military is working on similar systems. Some
are water-borne to go after surface ships with a radar profile no different
than a wave or a leaping fish. No doubt a submarine version is in the works or already exists. Put the armed dolphins out of work.
The point is well-made that these cheap attackers pose a threat to nations highly armed with heavy weaponry aimed at its own kind.

Peer review is necessary to assure blunders are not overlooked.

Eugen is right, the drones are targeted by coodinates
not by sight. Sight (or video) is used to spot the target,
then the target's coordinates are input to the data
collection, then the operator extracts the coordinates
to aim the missile, then the missile takes over.
The drone may have moved several miles away by then
but the missile will hammer to the coordinates. Time delay
makes no difference.
Sometimes the target;s coordinates are triangulated by
one or more drones, and maybe confirmation by a satellite,
to refine the coordinates for a smaller hit circle. But that is
done only if the target is stationary, one on the move may
be targeted very quickly, and tracked visually to confirm
the hit, to cheers in the USA.
These visual assassinations are what gives hard-ons at
CIA HQ (and wherever else they are piped to), sometimes
shown during lunch at the director's private dining room,
7th floor corner suite -- the kitchen's ventilation ducts and
burn-bag chimney adjacent make a nice target for payback.

what they do in AFPAK to people watching TV over dinner.
There do not appear to be anti-missile batteries at Langley
like those in DC and MD to protect POTUS aircraft. Could
be they are obscured in the public sat photos.

United States, Monaco Sign Tax Information Exchange Agreement
WASHINGTON  The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced
that the United States and Monaco have signed an agreement to allow for
the exchange of information on tax matters between the two countries.
The agreement was signed by Deputy Secretary Neal Wolin and Minister
Franck Biancheri in Washington.
"This Administration is wholeheartedly committed to combating offshore
tax evasion," said Deputy Secretary Wolin.  "We are working with countries
like Monaco to ensure that the IRS has access to the information that it
needs to enforce U.S. tax law.  Today's agreement serves as an example
for other financial centers around the world and reflects our continued
efforts to end the use of offshore accounts as a tool for tax evasion."
The Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) with Monaco will
provide the United States with access to information it needs to enforce
U.S. tax laws, including information related to bank accounts in Monaco.
The TIEA will permit the United States to seek information from Monaco,
beginning in 2010, on all types of taxes in both civil and criminal matters
regarding 2009 and later tax years.  As is customary with such agreements,
only specific tax authorities will be allowed to
receive and send information.
Information exchanged pursuant to the TIEA may be used only for tax
purposes, and the tax authorities must safeguard the confidentiality of
information exchanged pursuant to the TIEA.
In recent months, the Administration has demonstrated its commitment
to closing the tax gap.  At the G-20 Leaders' Summit in London, the U.S.
strongly supported efforts to ensure that all countries adhere to
international standards for exchange of tax information.  In the FY
2010 Budget, the Administration delivered a detailed reform agenda
to reduce the amount of taxes lost through unintended loopholes and
the illegal use of hidden accounts by well-off individuals.  The Treasury
Department has concluded Gibraltar's first-ever tax information
exchange agreement and has also concluded an agreement with
  Luxembourg to provide for greater exchange of tax information. In
June, the Treasury Department announced an agreement with
Switzerland to amend the U.S.-Switzerland income tax treaty to
provide for increased tax information exchange.

methods of counterspying. And as ever, because we are
superior and thus have the right to be worse than our imputed
enemies -- mostly imaginary, often our own villainous agents plotting with others of their kind pretending to be enemies to keep their racket lucrative. Religious warfare had to be invented
to excuse the slaughter of infidels. Messianism of Wikileaks is
comical but it has worked multitudes for millennia with imaginary
danger and protection. Do tithe.
Kissinger and Giuliani and Chertoff and thousands of insiders --
call them ph d candidates -- go on to greater wealth outside, switching back and forth to keep the flim-flam flowing.
All intelligence operations -- "knowledge industry" -- are illicit by design to exaggerate significance and risk, that way law (the most devious of all), mundane and heavenly, blesses them with powerful advertizing. They are all in cahoots. Wikileaks emulates an eternal business model, that is to lie and exaggerate about what it is doing. Every academic is familiar with these means and method,
avid promoters of it, get some of that old time higher
education, a certificate for excellence, a license to
recruit and train newcomers, a pretense of opposition
ie, high-level critique, ever plotting and dealing for perqs and advantages of salary, space, reputation, rank, and
showtime. Selling classified information is what the
knowledge industry was invented for.
Now Wikileaks is a challenge to the highly organized
operations of state, church, university, military, corporation,
NGO (spit), media and unaffiliated (watch out for these
cutthroat mercenaries alway betraying those stupid
enough to outsource to the temps stealing the jewels).
Assange stated at the beginning of Wikileaks it expected
to make big bucks, $5M the first year he wrote on a private mail list -- among other pimping messages later published on Cryptome.  The free stuff is meant lure volunteers and promote high-profile public service, lipsticked with risk, with the enterprise funded
by selling costly material sold on the black market of worldwide spying in the tradition of public benefit ops, id, spies and ever more spies. No better customers for illicit information that
those with depthless pockets. Soros and the Kochs have their
lesser-known Internet promoters backing Wikileaks generously.
And they expect good return on their investment, not just the
freebies used to attact attention.
Watch out for the public interest data miners of the Internet,
and leakers and whistleblowers, bandits stealing data, marking it up with glamorous titles, ie deeply researched, classified, actionable, nation threatening, liberating, etc, reselling publicly thourgh gadzillion press operations and secretly through those who pretend to avoid limelight. Think Archive.org, think Wikipedia, think Google, think this list
and your crafty mangy boil-ridden carcass. Mea culpa.

A show trial would be perfect. Assange is willing and eager.
Ellsberg pissing his britches, Wales kicking Ellsberg's shoe hoping a bust for publicity. The Internet would go over the top with delirium at being finally top featured as godawfully threatening as promised early on by its pimps and whores. Kelly, Gilmore, The Well, The

Tim wrote a provocative long essay a couple of months ago but barred publication, well, never answered a permission request.
He may be now violently executed -- that was foretold in the essay to happen immanently along with a gaggle of executioners.
Assange promises to do the same. Lessons learned.

Robtex.com shows a wondrous slew of brazen Net predators
for 92.241.190.202. Some might even be real criminals rather
than cops and their hired hackers on the prowl to steal data
and call it freedom of information. Recall that Wikileaks in its
earlier promotional material bragged of predating, sorry, liberating,
over 1 million files through Tor siphoning, aided and abetted by the noble-branded bandits "Chinese dissidents." After an outcry of betrayal of the trust of Tor, and Tor's own tut-tut
to keep its gaping security quiet, WL dropped that ad of the daring hacker outlaw campaign but several recent news reports continue to recycle it. Wikileaks like cops and hackers cannot overstate numbers, to wit,
WL's recent promotion of the number of words in upcoming
releases. Next, the count of alphanumerics, punctuation and
spaces to match the sock-puppeted WL followers on Twitter
and Facebook and holiest of all, Google hits.
Circling back to the start:
Mirror.wikileaks.info has an about page which tells, or pretends
to tell, how the site got started and how it distances itself with
a Russian-Chinese dissident bear hug from "The Original Wikileaks."
Malware in the Wikileaks releases is a provocative suggestion.
Certainly the technology for that is readily available and the practice
obligatory, usually as a "security feature," sometimes called
a hash or cookie or watermark or copyright-tracker or privacy
protection. Wait a minute, did you say privacy protection. Get out

@_subject: The inhumane conditions of Bradley Manning's detention 
Greenwald is a humorist at best, and a publicist at worst, a trained
shark advocating his client's interest by the media. Same as those
shilling for Assange to promote their services -- which never involve
going to jail and discomfort except when attention wane. A full-blown, no pun, Media Ho.
Military brigs are that, not civilian prisons, not movies and pederastic
fantasies. Their regulations are online, including that for Quantico Marine Brig, nothing secret about them. Glenn seems not to have read the regs, or found them too inmate-considerate and is lying as trained to do.
Manning is not in the kind of comical isolation Greenwald hoots. He
receives regular visits from his family and his legal team. He sees medical staff, janitorial staff, guards and their overseers, the military legal team and its Inspector General. Visits from gawking officers and civilians eyeing the celebrity inmate to be sure there will be no
grounds for neglect or abuse, which is media-driven defense SOP.
What Manning luckily avoids is guard duty, kitchen police, vile MREs and miscooked slop,  foot and crotch rot, lice, bedbugs and scabies,
STDs if fatihful to his hands and does not pig-kiss the guards for
favors, parades and field marches and bivouacs, getting coffee for his hung-over officers, enduring homophobes, unit inspections, armaments practice, stenching squad rooms, sadistic harassment by non-com and officer lifers, sand storms and leaking and muddy tent cities, burning fecal waste and scrubbing latrines, dropping the soap taunts, incoming fire and IEDs, trooper drunks, thieves, rapists, murderers, smokers and weightlifters. Visiting generals and politicians, inane work and toxic working conditions, on and on, kind of like what Glenn experienced in torturous law school, slave-driving law firm and neurotic love shack in Brazil.
This is not to suggest that Manning should not be out of jail,
but is threatened by those who want him there for their own
purposes, his supporters and opponents. To them he is more valuable outside than in to these predators as Assange now Manning and Assange share the ambition for jail time as
premium PR, both have bragged about that, claim to have studied the success of a long-line of role models. Manning
confessed to Lamo with that in mind. Did Assange use the
women for that, nah, too obvious. The trials will be shows of prolonged ecstacy among the

Cryptome was given a preview of OpenLeaks.org yesterday.
It appears to have learned from Wikileaks and many others.
An impressive preparation which advances development of
superior methods of combating secrecy openly, not just rushing
to copy Wikileaks.
It addresses many of the issues raised in this thread. Among others,
it promises to invite and respond to critiques openly and will share what it learns with other intiatives. Funding will be disclosed.
It is in testing now with access by invitation. It will be gradually rolled out with further testing, revision and fully opened in early 2011. The site has a link to an article in which Daniel D-B explains the initiative.
Daniel generated a PK on December 13, 2010 with the address
ddb at openleaks.org. He welcomes inquiries and advice, as he says, from those with more capabilities than the current "gang" which are working their asses off to get it right before rushing a faulty product to meet a PR-driven deadline, oh my, that goes against industry practice in an admirable way.

As the campaign heats up it will include deep-pocketed funders, traitors
planted inside security agencies, universities and corporations, squeezed informants against the ringleaders, congressional hearings, subpoenas, frightened naming of names, scouring of files for connecting dots at Archive.org, search
engines, social media, mail lists, news lists, chat rooms, IMs, email, and the
bountiful data collected by corporations, researchers, governments and their
contractors who claimed they were merely studying the fantastic growth of empowering digital culture or more sinisterly, preparing to protect the people from
enemies of centralized authoritatives.

Read the EFF and others' letter to Congress yesterday defending Wikileaks
and compare it to similar actions in the 1930s-1950s protesting clamp down on the worldwide Red Menace. Then read Sterling, Pilkington and Lanier
more closely. These smart guys know which way the wind is blowing and, as they write, they want no part in the insanity of taking freedom of

I tend to think that if this type of people ends up sticking to the

Multiple, discrete internets are coming into play, perhaps have always
First, the known internets, utilizing ubiquitious access logging which
under guise of administration allows universal spying:
1. The internet run by operators of the overall background system
which most users know little about or care.
2 The open policing apparatus of the overall system run by governments
and their contractors and cooperating non-profits.
3. The commercial internet providing services or products for pay.
4. The non-profit, open-source, volunteer internet providing services
or products at no cost or for donations.
5. The closed sub-internets, mil-gov classified, SCADA, restricted
and special purpose networks used by operators and administrators of
backbones, nodes, satellite, cable, wired and wireless systems,
Second, the unknown internets, with or without evident access logging:
6. The covert policing and spying internet which watches, logs,
mucks around, runs stings, causes accidents and shut-downs, cuts
cables, runs surprise tests and attacks, and keeps alive the demand
for covert oversight of all the known others.
7. The covert internets which hide among all the others, or try to
subject to discovery by 6.
8. The evanescent internets which are set up, used and disappear
quickly, openly or covertly, subject to 6.
9. The wayward and waylaid internets which cannot be identified:
rogues, experiments, mistakes, erratic systems, unexpected
glitches and consequences, acts of nature, forgotten protocols,
inept code, destructive code, lost access techniques, death
of the perpetrators.
10. Internets of combinations, hybrids, deceptions, ploys and

Yes, ten subscribers left and none not a rat.
New York Times today has at least three articles about online
spying, two in the back of the business section, one as the
principal piece in the Sunday Magazine, unusually long.
The magazine piece describes encouragement of people
to put everything out there as if a marvelous way to socialize.
Some coverage of the delirium of advertisers, such as the
Times, at this oil spill of free data.
One of the business articles focuses on Twitter giving all its
messages to the Library of Congress, and the delirium of
scholars at getting this oil spill of data unmediated by
authoritatives like the Times and greeders themselves.
Twitter claims it strongly emphasizes to its users about the
public nature of their data. Says it thinks its privacy policy
should be called a public policy, but that California requires
a privacy policy so it keeps the deception going to comply
with law.
All is online spying is lawful, and the data snatchers are
delirious with pleasure about it. Marc Rotenberg at EPIC
is the sole source quoted as saying US privacy policy is
totally fucked up. The article implies the EU approach is
better, despite there being no other governments on earth
that spy on its people more than the EU, and which blames
the US and China and Russia and anybody else handy for
being the threat.
Finally, a Times editorial today praises Google for its recent
disclosure of government requests for data. Says Google
intends to turn over the actual requests to an unnamed
non-profit for publication. Still no answer to what Google
does with the planetary-grade stuff it gathers, that's deeply
And nothing about the general online and offline spying
practices now endemic under guise of beneficial data
gathering and lawful compliance for what else the security
of users and nations and economies.
On to the hot shit handhelds, climate friendly vehicular
black boxes, monitors of kitchen appliances and crib-killer
and homicidal students and maturbating parents, and
automatic upgrades and renewals sucking your privates.
The Times chief editor says also today that the use of
anonymous sources is essential to check government
abuse, and while there are occasional abuses of the
practice that is why ombudspersons are there to keep
the Times authoritatively trustworthy. Nothing about
Times ads being composed of cancerous waste.

Like many supporters and detractors of Wikileaks Coll underestimates
the intent of the initiative. The comparison to media is fatuous as though
media, if not scholars, should be the dominant source of public information about governments and other authoritative institutions.
Media and scholars are themselves authoritatives more like governments
than different, enjoying privileges and protection all sides grant one
another while condemning those outside their fold.
None of the authoritatives are insurgencies and assuredly will find ways
to "critique" whatever disturbs their perquisites and opportunities, using
concepts and language meant to defuse and stigmatize threats.
There is overmuch circularity in Coll's apolgia for media in which he presumes an enduring value in responsible media and scholarhip that has been squandered by timid rumination. This marks a failure to
go beyond convention.
One might suspect Wikileaks is laughing its ass off at the high-value
conceit of supporters and detractors who are out to advance their
own initiatives under guise of pondering the Wikileaks each has
confected for that purpose -- and avoiding the high-risk of taking
on a true threat to authoritatives.
To be sure, Wikileaks as it has been might morph into a tamed beast
like so many short-lived, opportunisticly aggressive insurgencies
brought into submission with valorization, condemnation, attention, praise, notoriety, bribery, prizes and embrasure by mightily crafty and extremely well-endowed authoritatives who gobble up ambitious
rebels like sweetmeats.
Wikileaks would be smart to pull back from Ellsberg and those working
diligently to manage it in the most favored direction, the prefabricated
heroic, that is, all hat and no cattle.
Another New Yorker article this week explores the self-affirming drive toward heroism.
If not Assange's heroicly defiant Wikileaks peters out then many others more variable and durable, and that seems to be what's developing under
the radar of all too delusional incisiveness.

Jealousy is the lifeblood of ambition, Assange is a victim, and
who is not?
Sorry to say Brian, for you customarily offer unusually trenchant
commentary, your comments indicate a lack of awareness of the diverse
and multiple forums which offer material similar, and in many cases
superior, to that of Wikileaks -- offered long before as well as after
its inititation.
The leaks conceit of Wikileaks is deliberate, better known as
"breaking news," attention getting, the Wiki as false as democracy,
the promise of openness never fulfilled due to security needs of the
What is unique about Wikileaks is its publicity capability and for
that it deserves credit to bring to a non-institutional initiative,
thanks to the momentarily cheap Internet megaphone, the slick
braggardy well known as the key element for the "reputation,
responsibility and trustworthyiness" of big institutions from their
origin millennia ago.
Promoting established institutions is what the media -- journalism,
publishing, entertainment, advertising -- were invented to do by
creating the illusion that individuals have a say in "what's going
on." But never invited into the sanctums where decisions are made
about the means and methods for promulgating illusions.
All this has been said tiresomely (arch ouch) overmuch. So what else
is new about Wikileaks type initiatives that the hullabaloo can
One is to contain enthusiasm, if you will, about the uniquenss of
Wikileaks. It is not unique in the content it provides: there is
much more and better available by less celebrated means and methods,
once called research, reflection and reassement, continually done,
even non-institutionally, perhaps that most so, not reduced to
crowd-arousing bombshells in which the tiniest of comment is
viralized to thousands of sites -- try it: post anything with the
word Wikileaks in its title and watch it richochet in synapases of
To advance the much larger body of material it would be useful to
develop a battery of such socio-political-rich words which would
assure attention to an inititiative that might be otherwise swamped by
orchestrated viralization, ie, advertising. "Che" once did that, as do
"Obama" and "Assange" now, albeit somewhat smeared by assholes unable
to dream of less than godlike perfection.
Your point about jealous of other blogs has become a knee-jerker that
shows ignorance, well, lack of appreciation, of other initiatives
which have not been catapulted to the media stage where nearly every
commentator derives daily doses of inspiration to get off ass and be
"a player." Which means worthy of paying attention to. How to get from
being a non-entity to being a player is what Assange has demonstrated.
Not enough attention has been paid to how he imagined Wikileaks for
that, although a lot of superficial reporting has been done on the
person and personality of Assange.
Assange is more complicated and inscrutable than he has been
caricatured to be -- ie, mediaized. But then so are all heroes
manufactured in that mold and buried in that sarcophagus.
Agreed that much better analysis is needed for those who yearn for
that comfort food never available on blogs and the daily beasts.
Better than analysis though is to do more of what Wikileaks does
to get forbidden information into public hands, minds and hearts,
unanalyzed, and most crucially unmediated. That might mean fighting
the mediaized Internet addiction, say, for a day or two a week,
gradually assemble your own material and formulate its significance --
and do not rush to post the drivel, ponder, reassemble, exchange it
quietly, redo, rejigger, reflect, sit on it.
Arguing about fucking Wikileaks has led me to write more bombast
in the past six months than in the previous 14 years, as you can
readily see, and curtailed research and publication of unanalyzed
materials. The issue is infectious and induces Mailer's advertisements
for himself.
The Wikileaks initiative is now in grave danger of being destroyed
by the attention Assange yearned for and assumed would be easy to
handle. He is its Achilles heel. Not the first time that has happened,
again merely look at the over-celebrated who are over-loaded with our
cowardly aspirations that they do for us what we are too lazy or inept
to do for ourselves, everready to blame the socio-political gods that
failed, everready to vote in Time's Persons of the Year proffered by
manipulative authoritatives.

Give apathy a chance, stash away adrenaline rush. Be quiet
preacher, deity is snoozing with the flock.
Leaks are not what they are claimed to be. Ooze is better.
It is true that nearly all who have asked me, excuse the Thomas
Friedman conceit,  to comment on Wikileaks chastise for failing to join the orchestrated furor. I don't call them, the Wikileaks
shills drop the dime and pretend insult when I call them what
they are. Wikileaks in its original formulation is not what it has
become, but that is a common bait and switch of authoritatives,
compulsively reciting their credentials -- the history, the brand -- in the face of skepticism, or worse, disinterest -- how dare you
ignore Wikileaks was one of its last press releases and pep
talks to its volunteers mail list in the fall of 2009.
No matter I praise the initiative's valuable contribution of documents for study, the main focus since the fall of 2009 has been on the Wikileaks advertising wrapping which diminishes attention for the documents as does all advertising diminish journalism,
publishing, education and other means of information distribution.
Wikileaks commentary and preen on their documents substitutes
for the time and required to read, reflect and ponder, in accord
with editorialism and hyperbole of authoritatives who only
profit from the cream robbed from the milk.
Few consume Wikileaks documents of the past or present so enjoyable is the substitute MREs composed of ignorant opinion. Some brag of not reading the documents, then proceed to boogy madly "on the urgent issue," i.e., Glenn Greenwald and a pack of other pro and con yappers wrapped in ads for themselves, sorry, opinionators, articulators of authoritativenss, fierce wide-
eyeballers hoping to offset the dupery of opposing glazers.
No doubt the apatheticism induced by ages-old advertising of
authoritatives is the intent of hyperbole. However, it is worth
considering how apathy -- a euphemism which can conceal
a battery of resistances to parental hounding to behave and
believer -- frees from obedience of an incessant message to be like us, those who know, i.e. "breaking news," and a slew of exhortations to eat branded puke upchucked in lieu of your own meals, your own musings and doubts of the high-volume
Adrenaline is the aboriginal drug and without it not much

"what's important to know." And who knows this best, the
articulators of authoritativeness. Call them charlatans,
for which they will thank you, but do not ignore them, for which
they will assault your go away. Noise is what these brayers make, this is not needed by Wikileaks to do what it does best, indeed its PR is wide-mouthedly wretched in the carny barker
tradition, and has led to a cessation of document publication. All tweets and no docs is what adrenaline peddlers inject.
Knowledge industry is coequal with entertainment, mix the
two and you have advertising, which is a word over-trenchantly
examined for its teleological importance, self-vaunting, with
decades of blather and bombast about whore media and its
pimps, "the finest minds on earth." Writing and speaking in cliches is the norm now wrapped in self-hype to counter other people's apathy. #  distributed via : no commercial use without permission

panel that the principal disappointment of PGP.com was that too
few individuals used encryption, and that most of its use was
by corporations complying with customer privacy regulations
not for comsec.
With this in mind, individuals and corporations apparently do not
see the need for comsec, so in that sense Eric Schmidt, Google
apologist, is correct that privacy is not a big deal for those with
nothing to hide.
Phil Zimmermann, also on the panel, said nothing about PGP,
said he has moved on to a secure phone development.
The consensus was that Internet security was dead in the
water, only snake oil was successful at convincing customers
their privacy was "taken very seriously." If you read privacy
policies, and most of us don't as they evolve to be more slippery,
they are virtually identical in what they promise and admit
to customer betrayal for "lawful interception compliance."
There are a few law firms which specialize in these misleading
policies and write them to fit "acceptable industry standards."
Think of the ex-NIST and ex-NSA experts now advising
industry and government to issue regular scare stories about
The privacy watchdogs and verification services fit right in
with this flimflam -- all agree that officials have the right to
violate privacy, "it's the law," and that ISPs and Internet
operators must cooperate. You want privacy, do not use
digital technology, but don't tell the gaga Internet user that.

of the 1990s was lost, not won. Pretending to have won is

practices stop but do not order action to truly stop them. The reason is that the US (and its contractors) supplies the other nations with data on their citizens and subjects as well as funding and technology for homeland spying.
Blaming the hegemon-of-choice is obligatory strut.
And most importantly spies do not have to obey laws anywhere and provide exculpation for their mercenaries.
This is a global practice not invented in the US, indeed
it might be argued that the US is slightly less jaded
than other nations who have betrayed in secret fashions developed over millennia -- way before laws were confected
to bless official crime to fight threats to hegemons.
US hegemons will not be penalized nor lose customers
because alternatives are no more trustworthy. Check the gov-protected monopolies cum oligarchies that dominate Euro, Asian, African South American
countries which adopted Echelon as home brew
either by treaty or by unilateral corporatism -- the
path most favored by unregulated billionaires more numerous elsewhere than the US. And they all
have spy operations coupled to governments. They

The exploits of Anonymous to hack the systems of firms
providing spying services to governments and corporations
suggest that the WikiLeaks mini-era has been surpassed.
Much of WikiLeaks promise to protect sources is useless if the sources are not whistleblowers needing a forum for publication. Instead publishers of secret information grab it directly for posting to Torrent for anybody to access
without mediation and mark-up by self-esteemed peddlers of protection, interpretationa and authentication, including media cum scholars.

are the best reading of Internet derring-do yet and far exceeds the much simpler version of WikiLeaks carefully bruited as if precious but is not according to Daniel Domscheit-Berg's AnonLeaks.ru is a remarkable advance of WikiLeaks. And
promises much more by the same means and methods most
associated with official spies -- NSA and CIA run the Special Collections Service to do exactly that kind of criminal aggression, along with black bag burglaries, surveillance and bugging. Contractors hiring ex-spies do much of this highly classified work as well and invent and supply the gadgets and front organizations required.
Not least of importance of the Anonymous hack and the many
preceding it is the revelation of how commercial firms have been exploiting public ignorance of their spying capacity. That they are themselves vulnerable is a surprise to them, as it must  be to those who hire them and, in the case of governments, provide legal cover for criminal actions.
This is not news, to be sure, for it has been alleged and
reported on for decades but mostly in technical journals
and conferences where offerers strut their malwares to
buyers of perfidium.
Imagine that instead of the many iterations of Wikileaks
now appearing to receive and publish documents, that more of the Anonymous-type hacks simply steal the family jewels of the spies, officials, lobbyists and corporations believing they own the territory in order to show the extent of their secret predations on the public.
The digitization of vast archives of government, commercial
and non-governmental organizations to facilitate their
hegemony provides a bounty to be hacked repeatedly
despite attempts to prevent it by vainly inept cybersecurity
agencies and firms.
The cyber officials yell, hit the Internet Switch. Too late, too late. Anonymous controls the switch.  Sure, Anonymous
can be compromised with sufficient hostile and friendly
inducements, but so can the predators, perhaps moreso
the latter.
I like that venerable Anonymous and the promise it offers as the Nymous authoritatives of secrecy frantically attempt to ban its privilege. For the WL era dutifully enshrine Julian Assange and Bradley

What might be most enviable about Julian is that he has held
few if any jobs to distract him from exploring personal philosophy and to plot great conquests and become very rich. During the twenty years from about 18 to 38, he has managed to obtain food, shelter, clothing, child care payments, health care, expenses for travel and entertainment, laptops and network service, and a motorbike for 2-3 years of globe circling -- perhaps
setting up a network of cohorts. (He described his itinerary on
this noble forum in 2001.) Nothing unusual about this off-the-grid lifestyle among hackers.
Like a lot of thoughtful humans not convinced steady work for
bosses is a good thing, they do have a knack for avoiding regular employment. Some speculate they sell their hacker fruits of network (TOR, DoD,
et al) siphoning on the black market, or extort payments from targets to return material or to not report nasty info to the authorities or news media -- or most profitable, to gin up the bidding for stolen data among competitors. Say, the Bank of America ploy, "hard drive"
certified, fool.
Those not adept at keeping income coming this way, can pick up a few thousands ratting on other hacker-entrepreneurs to the authorities, or best, to commercial spies who extort the ratee for information then mark it up as their own product.
These techniques appear to be in full flower with Wikileaks and its
desparate MSM partners, agog fans and penny-ante sock-puppets, but are hardly restricted to the newbie initiative. Businesses have alwayes used the same tawdry practices to assure profitability to the bosses, to screw the workers and investors, and the methods are taught in business schools and fine-tuned in lawyers and publicist-cum-journalists' conference rooms. The deals negotiated among WL and the MSM will make great reading
in the slacker colleges someday but not so long as they are laying
golden eggs. Off the grid is where the real money flows. As is often
yelled in this very iniquitous den.

the public service racketeers. It is not about getting press coverage simply but coverage for advertising what can be bought under the table and on the black market -- just like official and criminal managers of information

The 1882 monograph that Dr. Bellovin stumbled across in
the Library of Congress was "Telegraphic Code to Insure
Privacy and Secrecy in the Transmission of Telegrams,"
by Frank Miller, a successful banker in Sacramento who
later became a trustee of Stanford University. In Millers
preface, the key points jumped off the page:
"A banker in the West should prepare a list of irregular
numbers to be called shift numbers," he wrote. "The
difference between such numbers must not be regular.
When a shift-number has been applied, or used, it must
be erased from the list and not be used again."
That sent the astonished Dr. Bellovin to the Internet to
try to find out whether Mr. Millers innovation was known
to the later inventors.
The results of his largely online detective work can be

According to several independent specialists in cryptography,
Mr. Miller was undoubtedly the first to propose the concept
of the one-time pad.
"Miller probably invented the one-time pad, but without
knowing why it was perfectly secure or even that it was,"
said David Kahn, the author of the definitive 1967 book
"The Codebreakers." "Moreover, unlike Mauborgnes

of the one-time pad to superencipher their Foreign Office

Open source has always been dual-use, and the usage of

that is how spy agencies use the term, but looking at other
uses it seems clear that it is a cloak for deception to a greater

confidence attracts shrewder investors. Vulture capitalists,

@_subject: In brig,WikiLeaks suspect Bradley Manning ordered to sleep  
Manning's capability to taunt his jailers indicates his mental health is not a problem, thus undercutting accusations of deterioration due to, uh, torture. Standing nude, being gazed by beefy guards, is not all that bad. Manning has accomplished his life's wet dream, and for that he is to be pedestaled iconically.
There remains the always auto-mesmerzing issue of masturbation, according to Jean Genet the favorite prison and military and collegiate activity (inside and outside family colonies), and its near endlessly variable attraction and repulsion of the jailers, as watchers, as cheerleaders, as participants, as connoisseurs of welcomely forbidden pleasures of sadism and masochism.
That the brig is headed by a female Marine ratchets up the
auto-stimulation to Nurse Ratchet's castrating diabolism, the
Society for Cutting Up Men coming out of the bitch-hatchetry.
Soon, the society of BGLT hackers and leakers, so to speak,
will come out. Genet, and gobs of others, averred there is
nothing to compare with the military for pansexuality perversity
except the Church. Children preferred. Childlike adults delectable
substitutes. Bradass87, bare assed and loving it, you couldn't make this up for a Cuckoo Nest flic.
So how many of the Manning guards are female, gay, tranny -- pansexual hornism a given? Prepare to kill and die priapically, fuck mud Gyrenes!

However, this appears to be a giant evasion perhaps asubterfuge, even reminds of what Big Boys say when customers learn they are siphoning customer data. Read the privacy policy the lawyer-advised apologists bark, and upon reading the privacy policy see that it only emphasizes the subterfuge. Openly admitting siphoning is supposed to make it okay because everyone does it under cover of lockstep
privacy policy. Fuck that.
If the Tor operators really know what they are being used for, then they should admit to being agents of the USG, as Michael Reed had the guts to do.
Claiming this US spying role for Tor is well known is a crock of shit,
but then spies lie all the time and care not a whit that they peddle
shit for eaters of it. If you believe them and like what they do then don't shilly-shally, just do what Michael Reed did but others are
too ashamed to do after having been duped since 1996.
If Reed's precedent for honesty is followed, there will be an admission that the Internet was invented for spying by its inventor. And then cryptography and other comsec tools. And then cellphones and the like. Hold on now, this is getting out of hand, the apologists
will bellow, everybody has always known that there is no privacy
in digital world.
Actually, no, they did not. And those who knew keep their fucking
mouths shut to reap the rewards of deception. Now that is a truth
everyone knows. No conspiracy theory needed.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor in Mexico 
Tor is not alone in misleading users about online security.
It would be worth repeating that security online, as offline,
is always an iffy promise and that communication and
identity-protection caution is a basic requirement.
Offerers of security in whatever guise -- national,
governmental, commercial, organizational, religious,
individual -- are well aware of the limits of what is being offered and thus over-promise to conceal those limits.
Security should be understood to mean limited security,
which is how security experts know it. A few of them laugh,
or growl, at the ease with which scoundrels among them
deceive the public. Most, however, enjoy the rewards of keeping quiet, or most likely, shading the truth in such a way that when vulnerabilities are exposed -- ie, people die (far more than sacrosanct journalists, entire duped
populations) -- they roll out the usual exculpations of charging the victims with complicity in their suffering for believing what they were told.
Never trust a security expert for they an incapable of
knowing the full consequences of what they are advising
about, having been trained to fudge, blather, brag, warn, and promulgate the faith.
Security means to blame the victim, that is, require to
the victim to believe in corrupt security, to never doubt the security offerers, all of whom are motherfucking liars, cheats and false priests, most often in pay of those who reap great fortunes fucking the people,
themselves protected by secrecy.
Without secrecy none of this shit would work. Thus,
above all else, cloaking secrecy with evasive bullshit is essential, for example, the open source religion
which hides crimes and misdemeanors around
the globe, above and below.
Dinky revelations of vulnerabilities hide great ones.
Thus, the near monthly revelations of data hacking,
the crowing about finding holes, the issuing of new
patches and protections, the revisions of privacy
policies, the proposed new legislation and regulation
to control violations, the warnings of national attacks,
the grandstanding virii of machinic attacks, the calls
for digital identities and banning of anonymity, the
jailing of a few pipsqueak examples, the avoidance
of effective law enforcement and punishment of
major cartels and spy regimes inside and outside government, the excusing of corporate and institutional
siphoning of user data, the lack of constraint on military
arms sales and product promotiing wars, well, its a long list of what secret security fosters.
Believe nothing you hear about security, should be the
motto required of every peddler and advocate of it.
Alternatives to security are available but get no traction
against the hegemon.

There is a movement these days to warn about threats without
a convincing response to them except to urge support after

against beliefs -- have long been a means to drive the people this way

Stallman aptly warns of system operators -- technocrats, priests,

@_subject: [cryptography] Non-governmental exploitation of crypto   
References:  If there's so let us
A fundamental characteristic of non-toy (especially unbreakable!)
encryption is that any failure is due to implementation or some
other fault beyond the cipher.
This indefensible circularity is audacious but necessary for
the illusory claims for a strong cipher.
In more recent times, another necessary illusion is that if a cipher has been broken it will be publicly revealed.
Despite the ancient concealment of vulnerabilities of
ciphersystems in order to exploit trust in them.
Then there is the argument that different standards of
cipher protection must be declared in order to determine
whether a cipher meets a standard. And this leads to
an ever receding standard for the best and a pile-up of
lesser promises unmet.
And there is a presumption that the best encryption will be expropriated by national governments and their selected
agents and must be kept out of the hands of the governed.
Hence, best ciphersystems are never revealed or disappear
from public view via official secrecy classification or NDA.
These evasions are used by cipher (and security)
snake oil peddlers to maximum advantage such that it is probably wise to consider all cipher (security) systems snake oil, or more precisely, toys requiring sophisticated marketing and exculpations of failure -- at which crypto
and official security wizards may be expected to excell.

I'm currently working with low power radios in consumer electronics.

Going into things like TV remote controls.  Great for protecting your keystrokes on a qwerty remote control when using TV like a computer. Makes you wonder about AES 128. .... Also, adding a microphone (think Siri voice control) is becoming
commonplace.  Which can be fun but the microphone is in a system which can be manipulated.  As someone (DIRNSA ?) recently said, folks are bugging themselves. At least certain Sun workstations of old turned on an LED when the microphone was enabled. .... It is now trivial to make a bursted, encrypted audio bug the size of the

"Cryptocat is an enabling, positive technology, and its an alternative," said Jacob Appelbaum, a developer with the Tor project, which routes Web traffic in ways that help disguise sites that people have visited. "A key thing here is that it is an experiment, with valid criticisms. Its not perfect. But it is important that we have people who are interested and knowledgeable about computer security who are working on these things, not just for money, and not just to break into peoples computers."
The group met over the weekend at a code-a-thon organized by Julia Angwin of The Wall Street Journal, which has chronicled the spread of commercial surveillance in everyday technology in a vital series of articles and engaging online demonstrations called What They Know. A recent article in Wired magazine detailed big advances in United States government surveillance capabilities. Mr. Appelbaum and a documentary filmmaker, Laura Poitras, are holding a teach-in Friday evening at the Whitney Museum of American Art on the subject of surveillance. [Tony museum to host tony geeks!]
The invention of powerful tools to thwart the commercial and governmental collection of personal data has been criticized as creating hiding places for terrorists and online sexual predators. Mr. Kobeissi said he had been startled by those complaints. "Evil people have been evil forever," he said. "I dont think theyre going to stop being evil or become more evil because of Cryptocat."
He appears to be wide open and unguarded about himself.
"I love it when people criticize me," he said, pausing for a second and then amending his words. "When they criticize me technically."
His ambitions with Cryptocat are not financial, though he is trying to raise $2,000 to cover his costs for the next year. "Money is great, money is amazing," he said. "Its not like money is something I dont understand. I understand what it is. I care more about making something nice that people can use, and its free and it makes a difference."

Good point that deserves much greater attention, drones as good
a starting point as any other evolving surveillance technology. Fragmentation of privacy policy and enforcement among a slew of stakeholders inside and outside government allows, actually encourages, diverse, contradictory, and evasive compliance with all too flatulent aspirations for privacy forever subjected to security.
The US has no fully empowered privacy commission, presumably to allow continuous evasion of fulfilling privacy promises deliberately intended to be violated on behalf of evolving, usual secret, national interests of government and commerce. Same old BS of putting government and its contractors before taxpayers.
Secrecy, both governmental and non-governmental, remains the biggest threat to privacy and security around the globe. Secrecy
policy is a huge mess, bloated and costly, and privacy policy
cannot compete so long as the secrecy hegemon prevails.
US Patent and Trademark Office today seeks comments on
revising policy to issue secrecy orders for "economically
significant patents." Economy as vital as WMDs.
It is apt to refer to all technologies, Google, MS, Cisco, universities,
et al, which perform the dual use of user convenience and spying on users. And arguments for both being necessarily linked are specious apologias which open the door for privacy abuse under guise of security, now economical -- a segue perfect for opposing
Occupy Wall Street.
An industry has grown to eploit the two sides of privacy and
security, using the wedge of secrecy to assure secrecy always
wins over privacy in the name of law enforcement and national No privacy policy is worth a centavo due to the ever-present
flatulence about abiding with lawful requests for data access
which in turn is a cover story to hide technological access
outside the law.
Finally, it has become commonplace for technologists to
succumb to legal persuasion to lie about technological
capabilities to transgress human rights. Put a lawyer
and a technologist together and you have a duality now
ruling communications by hook and crook.

Applying cryptography's bag of tricks to Julian Assange's
introduction to the new book, Cypherpunks: Freedom and the
Future of the Internet, entitled "A Call to Cryptographic Arms,"
it could be taken as a "A Cryptographic Call to Arms," that is,
an encrypted warning contained within the plain text.
Assange and WikiLeaks, like cypherpunks, is masterfully wily
at practicing the characteristic cryptography feature of duplicity,
never revealing what is going on beneath public assurances of
Assange and WikiLeaks, like cypherpunks, invoke open-closed
cryptographic duplicity as his personal behavior and as the policy
of the WikiLeaks initiative. Concealing, obscuring and diverting
his personal affairs while seeking publicity, and concealing,
obscuring and diverting the inner affairs of the operation  for
disclosing documents openly. This is cryptography in action.
In the same fashion Assange-WikiLeaks has periodically published
encrypted packages as "insurance" against takedown, it has also
released the unredacted State Department cables by way of a
complicated, presumably, orchestrated, leak. The leak of the
password to the cable collection by giving it to journalists to
publish is a classic instance of cryptographic dupery.
Cryptography formulates threats, ruses, disclosures, ploys,
diversions, deceptions, double-crosses, triple-crosses to hide
strengths and weaknesses, attacks and defenses, lies and
dissimulations, assurances of innocence and candor.
Crypto AG is a classic instance of NSA deception, among many,
to install a backdoor in a widely adopted encrypted system, then
leaked decades later as a warning to those who think they can
obtain fully secure communication systems.
A recent example if that of open source cryptography promoted
as means to verify encryption systems by public disclosure and
examination. Its shortcoming, and virtue to the wily, is that far
from all cryptographers subscribe to the sharing venture -- notably
those associated with governments, corporations and mendacious
individual efforts, instead take open source and not reveal what is
found of its weaknesses (to be exploited in secret) nor what is done
with the gift. US spies have admitted they take open source but do
not give back.
The same could be said of leak sites, anonymizers, IRC, news and
mail groups, social media, Skype, varieties of comsec offerings, and
the Internet itself among its many levels of access. Offer services,
free, paid, purloined or onioned, for which the take is much greater
than the offerings -- the standard asymmetric-warfare model, derived
from governance, education, non-profits and history's all-time leader,
religion, the latter exceeded only by wily hyenas patrolling the herd
to mount novel attacks to take down over-confident herdmasters.
Cryptographers do not trust one another. Cypherpunks triple cross
as ruse.
Consider that the Assange-WikiLeaks book Cypherpunks is a
cryptographic ruse which conveys an encrypted body of secrets,
additional insurance against the takedown of Assange and WikiLeaks
to be declared after the volume is widely distributed in print and
e-book form. A modern Lutherian proclamation of open and
encrypted dissent against the corruption of closed and secret
Further, imagine that Assange-WikiLeaks is planting encrypted
bits in all its releases which can be decrypted at a future time,
to re-assemble into a larger disclosure. In the world of cryptography
this would be expected.  Cypherpunks advocate this encrypted
concealment, dispersion, distribution and future coalescence.
Pre-positioning attacks and defenses well before they are needed
is conventional warfare -- as well as political, economic and
philosophical enterprise. Cypherpunks, before, during and after
WikiLeaks, has pre-positioned encrypted packs of arms demurely
clothed in dissent from and opposition to governance, finance and
This cryptographic call to arms is a triple-cross under a double-cross
planted in roots of trust, openness masquerading for multi-level
deception, in short, the essence of heavily-armored cryptography.

examined the initiative's whole body of material and promotional
enterprise. Now that Assange has cloaked himself and the
three others in the cypherpunks/cryptography mantle I think
his shit-storm is coming this way.
I agree with putting distance between what has happened in
cypherpunks Vegas from what is brewing in DoJ. More of
that is probably a good thing. That was the purpose of the
screed against Assange's insurance entrapment via weak
crypto meant to be cracked with leak-fed access.

of cypherpunks and forget the easily dismissed summary.
Assange is playing the cypherpunks card for a purpose that
deserves scrutiny if for no other reason than to avoid being
sucked into his practice of taking credit for wins and shifting
blame to others when the chips are down. That is why he
proclaims to be a privileged journalist after years of disparaging
the corruption of that crowd.

A worthy initiative for the press.
Unfortunately press is only one means of freedom of expression,
speech, writing, demonstration, opposition, dissent and creative
trouble-making-- and hardly objective due to its commercial
objective and very loud-mouth, conceit, craven to power and
vanity bred by constituional protection of its risk-averse cartel.
Press has generated too many fortunes to be singled out for
crowd-sourced support.
Freedom of the Press is way too limiting, but then that is the
nature of its organizers and board members. The rich ones
in particular are notabably uninvolved in acitivities that
would threaten their wealth and freedom to lord it over
the poor fans being urged to crowd-fund just like venal
politicians who also adore the press for amplifying their
campaigns for dumping crocks of shit on the public.
Far better would be for a huge increase in disorganized
initiatives of the unruly crowd far from being controlled
and exploited by lucrative investment in "crowd-sourcing."
Watch out for the crowd-sourcing predators driving the
market in the cloud, the latest invention for spying on
and profiling the public for marketing profits.
Dan Gillmor has been had by his friends, at best, at
worst, complicit in the  market boosting deception

O'Brien is right that no trustworthy anonymity is possible over a public network like the Internet due to the basic design of
the Internet to track its use. At best there are varying degrees
of trustworthiness such as Tor-like widgets, the semi-classified
milnet and intelnets, somewhat isolated nets like BlackNet and Darknet, partially-hidden encrypted paths, kind of cloaked
nets, ineptly-cloaked multi-level proxies and subterfuges, and
more that proffer protection but suffer in all cases from limiting
adjectives of partiality and depending upon outwitting a user

throats, drops, brown packages, cranium crypto, homing
pigeons, "unbreakable math," were any less porous or less
subject to dreamy exaggeration, black bagging, bribes,
sex stings, vanity and stupidity.
What hope for noble journalism (not the same as cranky, cantakerous, paranoid, ill-paid journalists) remains, though, is the gullibility of sources to believe their risk is protected by journalistic ethics as good as those of lawyers, doctors, architects, bankers, officials and BFFs.
"Sources" is an asymmetrical term of artifice not to be believed. STFU or publish yourself or be gulled by the allure

References:    <20120120103253.GX21917 Harking back to the Echelon era, it is worth noting that those
five countries - US, UK, AU, CA, NZ - are in the forefront of mega-managing the security of the Internet, no doubt refining and expanding the technological tools and sneaky extra-legal practices to work their combined will on global communications.
Gaining access to MegaUpload's emails, business records and
financial affairs likely required several multi-jurisdictional actions not only by the Echelon partners by also by allies such as those in NATO.
As often discussed here, the use of military capabilities developed
for national security for civilian criminal affairs matters is amply indicated in the MegaUpload indictment.
Indicting in the US, in particular in the Eastern District of Virginia,
the pre-eminent national security court, also indicates a bias
toward national security undergirding arguments for economic
security threat. That too was often debated here in the crypto
wars of the 1990s.
Recent defense funding authorization of holding alleged
terrorists indefinitely, keeping Gitmo alive, SOPA, PIPA, MegaUpload, Bradley Manning, WikiLeaks, huge funding
increases for openly hiring hackers and paying those undecover to rat on cohorts, also reminds of the extra-legalities
and betrayals of the early public crypto era.
to beat government, then gradual co-optation by legal
threats, bribes, scholarships, contracts, stigma, isolation,
betrayals, call that the After Echelon Option -- it should be expected that the same means and methods will be used in cyber wars, offense and defense mutually aggrandizing
one another.
Note that there have been a slew of seeming public interest
comsec initiatives in recent years to address cyber threats combined with threats to privacy. Observing the particpants in these there are quite a few recognizable warriors from the crypto-comsec-privacy wars. Fine minds and good hearts still proposing technological solutions to the issues, warning of legal if not military oppostion. Ginning up more technical fixes to comsec and privacy, reminding of past errors and promises gone awry, sniping at one another, admitting NDA withholdings, parading an impressive list of corporate domains after the nyms.
Optimistically, using the wind down of the Cold War as
a precedent, when crypto wizards came of out of classified
realms due to decline of nat sec jobs, the wind down of GWOT could lead to comsec wizards coming out of similarly classified realms to aid civilians against those remaining in the world
of secrecy worldwide.
It would be a swell outcome of classified research to heed
its inherent dual use once again on the dual use Internet:
between those who want to control it with an iron hand
of government and commerce and those who want to free it from
that hand. That will depend upon who gets paid to betray
the public and those who defend the public.
It is not easy to tell who is who since both copy one another's
language, behavior and promises -- most of the charges
against MegaUpload could be applied to government and
commerce. Call that Mega Echelon Option.

Tor-talk unsubbed me yesterday, probably for publishing on Cryptome
Eugen's forward of this thread's initial message from Roger Dingledine,
with our additional pointers to enduring USG funding of the Tor Project.
That Tor Project has enlisted many dedicated participants around the
world is most admirable. If it was not so jingoistic and US-promotional
it would be a crowd-source service deserving of trustworthiness.
Its long-time funding by the USG propanda agency, the Broadcast Board
of Govenors, as well as several front organizations, is not to be overlooked
by incessant braggardy, technical conceit and thin-skinnedness by its
spokespersons, primarily majordomos Andrew Newman and Jacob
Appelbaum, now joined by sub-lieutenants to admit not serious faults
in the system. (The inventors and most capable technologists of Tor
do not exaggerate its virtues.)
Tor Project's duplicity reminds of ICANN and a slew of other USG TLA to maintain control of the Internet while espousing a US-centric version
of information freedom which actually serves as a component of the
US national security regime.
State Department brags of the thousands of info fighters it is subsidizing,
and NSA is openly recruiting hackers. It should be assumed that the TLAs
have co-opted Anonymous-like initiatives in concert with pernicious
sockpuppetry in social media.
Tor Project would benefit from escaping USG financial clutches, albeit
difficult if dependency has become inured. The proposal to expand USG
funding for exit relays -- its most vulnerable and compromisable aspect --
is a gift horse needing a dental check before buying in.

Minutely detailed descriptions are provided of how drones are directed from
screeners at Centcom and pilots at Creech AFB using a battery of secure
communications devices: IRC chat, radio, video, satellites, VOIP, telephone,
not all of which are coordinated and supervised and thus lead to disaster.
Pilots of choppers which fired the Hellfire missiles claim drone operators
cannot be trusted due to lack of contact with real world conditions on
the ground and because mission controllers at Creech reward "Top Gun"
Caution of screeners at Centcom and in Afghanistan in this case were overridden by drone operators at Creech to authorize kinetic action
against the civilians. As one military interviewee said: from the safety
of Creech drone pilots were too avid for kills and used the Tom Cruise
Top Gun appellation to describe their "juvenile" behavior.
The whole report is worth reading and promulgating to counter the PR machinery promoting drones as safe-kill from afar. Interviews of the civilians writhing painfully in hospitals probably won't get much press.

This Machine Kills Secrets: How WikiLeakers, Cypherpunks,
and Hacktivists Aim to Free the World's Information [Hardcover]
Andy Greenberg
Publication Date: September 13, 2012
The barbarians aren't at the gates. They're inside. This is the first full
account of the cypherpunks who aim to free the world's information,
from the Forbes reporter whose work has traced their history and future.
What is the machine that kills secrets?
WikiLeaks brought to light a new form of whistleblowing, using
powerful cryptographic code to hide leakers' identities while
they spill the private data of government agencies and corporations.
But that technology has been evolving for decades in the hands of
hackers and radical activists, from the libertarian enclaves of
Northern California to Berlin to the Balkans. And the secret-killing
machine continues to evolve beyond WikiLeaks, as a movement
of hacktivists aims to obliterate the world's institutional secrecy.
This is the story of the code and the characters -- idealists,
anarchists, extremists -- who are transforming the next generation's
notion of what activism can be.
With unrivaled access to such major players as Julian Assange,
Daniel Domscheit-Berg, and WikiLeaks' shadowy engineer known
as the Architect, never before interviewed, reporter Andy Greenberg
unveils the world of politically-motivated hackers -- who they are
and how they operate.

from a staff meeting about his disdain of practicality while
claiming melodramatically he has "two wars to fight."
Greenwald has zero comprehension of the machinery,

And only a bit of the "laws of war." Instead, he maneuvers

Drones have become the new encryption fad wherein coders,
bloggers and journalists believe themselves empowered to

References: <20121031195921.GJ9750
Under the decades-old five-party surveillance agreement --
US, UK, CA, AU and NZ, also known as Echelon -- the nations
share information and swap staff. They also spy on each other's
citizens when barred from doing so directly.
The tricky part is if an temporary NSA staff member in CA is sitting next to
a CA member spying on US citizens (same for the roles swapped)
is there a literal firewall between the two's computers as well as
physically between the staff, or is that handled by lawyers waving
magic wands, as do the CIA's lawyers finger a drone target.
The other tricky part is what is called "de minimus" spying on
citizens where if a signal of a banned target is "inadvertently"
acquired how thoroughly is the signal quashed. One version
says that the spying agency archives the signal, indefinitely,
and does not distribute to customers (unless winked by
lawyers), but is everready to retrieve the signal should
circumstances and secret presidential orders demand
as with the EFF/ATT/NSA affair.
Utah Data Center is reportedly being built to store virtually
unlimited amounts of data and signal in the expectation that
everything may become useful at some point, with newly
born algorithms sifting for overlooked needles.
In this sense, it is reasonable to assume that Echelon has
been superceded by secret laws allowing the spies to do
whatever is needed to spy their citizens and anybody else --
leaving open-ended what "needed" means to avoid another
Pearl Harbor, OMG!
Perpetual war justifies this full-dominance pan-survellience,
as recently reported in WaPo with respect to drones and
the spying acquiring citizen targets, including those of
the five-parties who foolishly question authority with
the expectation that freedom of expression is inviolable.
Nothing in this is new: nations have been doing this since
nationhood was invented to delude citizens into believing
royal secrecy and greed was over not insitutionalized
in the world's spying machines, aka, telecommunications,
Internet, Tor, encryption, anonymizers, WOT, human
rights initiatives, cyber-freedom fighting.
One way to de minimizing yourself is to work for the
spies, so the recruiters promise, however, only later
do you learn about how they spy on insiders -- for life,
using the tried and true means and methods of
ex-spies sent out to join the outsiders with tales
of despicable spyng by methods intendd to deflect
deeper inquiry.

Agencies Could Improve Information Sharing and End-Use Monitoring on  Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Exports
Full 58-page report, PDF: GAO-12-536, Jul 30, 2012
What GAO Found
Since 2005, the number of countries that acquired an unmanned aerial  vehicle (UAV) system nearly doubled from about 40 to more than 75. In  addition, countries of proliferation concern developed and fielded  increasingly more sophisticated systems. Recent trends in new UAV  capabilities, including armed and miniature UAVs, increased the number of military applications for this technology. A number of new civilian and commercial applications, such as law enforcement and environmental monitoring, are available for UAVs, but these applications are limited by regulatory restrictions on civilian airspace.
The United States likely faces increasing risks as countries of concern and terrorist organizations seek to acquire UAV technology. Foreign countries' and terrorists' acquisition of UAVs could provide them with increased abilities to gather intelligence on and conduct attacks against U.S. interests. For instance, some foreign countries likely have already used UAVs to gather information on U.S. military activities overseas. Alternatively, the U.S. government has determined that selected transfers of UAV technology support its national security interests by providing allies with key capabilities and by helping retain a strong industrial base for UAV production. For instance, the United Kingdom and Italy have used UAVs purchased from the United States to collect data on Taliban activity in Afghanistan.
The United States has engaged in multilateral and bilateral diplomacy to address UAV proliferation concerns. The United States principally engaged the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) to address multilateral UAV proliferation concerns. Since 2005, the United States proposed certain significant changes to address how MTCR controls UAVs, but members could not reach a consensus for these changes. Also, while the Wassenaar Arrangement (Wassenaar) controls the export of some key dual-use UAV components, it does not control other dual-use technologies that are commonly used in UAVs. The Department of State (State) has also used diplomatic cables to address the proliferation of UAV-related technologies bilaterally. State provided to GAO about 70 cables that it sent from January 2005 to September 2011 addressing UAV-related concerns to about 20  governments and the MTCR. Over 75 percent of these cables focused on  efforts by a small number of countries of concern to obtain UAV technology.
U.S. agencies coordinate in several ways to control the spread of UAV  technology, but could improve their UAV-related information sharing. For instance, an interagency group reviews many license applications to export UAV technology. However, there is not a formal mechanism to ensure that licensing agencies have relevant and timely intelligence information when making licensing decisions. Also, State's licensing database cannot provide aggregate data on military UAV exports State has authorized, which may impair the U.S. government's ability to oversee the release of sensitive UAV technology. The Department of Defense (DOD) and State each conduct end-use monitoring of some UAV exports, but differences in the agencies' programs may result in similar types of items being subject to different levels of oversight.

@_subject: [drone-list] GAO: Addressing Privacy Concerns for Integration of 
Full report: Unmanned Aircraft Systems: Measuring Progress and Addressing Potential Privacy Concerns Would Facilitate Integration into the National Airspace GAO-12-981, Sep 14, 2012
What GAO Found
Progress has been made, but additional work is needed to overcome many of the obstacles to the safe integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) that GAO identified in 2008. GAO reported in 2008 that UAS could not meet the aviation safety requirements developed for manned aircraft and that this posed several obstacles to safe and routine operation in the national airspace system. These obstacles still exist and include the inability for UAS to sense and avoid other aircraft and airborne objects in a manner similar to manned aircraft; vulnerabilities in the command and control of UAS operations; the lack of technological and operational standards needed to guide safe and consistent performance of UAS; and final regulations to accelerate the safe integration of UAS into the national airspace system. The Joint Planning and Development Office of the FAA has provided UAS stakeholders with a framework to collaborate and coordinate their UAS integration efforts.
Congress set forth specific requirements and deadlines in the FAA  Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 for FAA to safely accelerate UAS  integration. FAA, in coordination with stakeholders, has begun making  progress toward completing those requirements, but has missed one deadline and could miss others. Many of the requirements entail significant work, including completing planning efforts and issuing a final rule for small UAS. Most of the requirements are to be achieved by December 2015. While FAA has taken steps to meet them, it is uncertain when the national airspace system will be prepared to accommodate UAS given that these efforts are occurring simultaneously and without monitoring to assess the quality of progress over time toward the deadlines Congress established. Better monitoring can help FAA understand what has been achieved and what remains to be done and can also help keep Congress informed about this significant change to the aviation landscape.
Concerns about national security, privacy, and the interference in Global Positioning-System (GPS) signals have not been resolved and may influence acceptance of routine access for UAS in the national airspace system. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has the authority to regulate security of all modes of transportation, including non-military UAS. Working with FAA and other federal agencies, TSA implements security procedures, such as airspace restrictions like those limiting operations into and out of Ronald Reagan National Airport. In 2008, GAO recommended that TSA examine the security  implications of non-military UAS. According to a TSA official, it recently reviewed its UAS related advisories and determined that they are still applicable. TSA has not provided information on its efforts to mitigate security implications of UAS, and GAO believes TSA should act on this recommendation. Stakeholder privacy concerns include the potential for increased amounts of government surveillance using technologies placed on UAS, the collection and use of such data, and potential violations of constitutional Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizures. Currently, no federal agency has specific statutory responsibility to regulate privacy matters relating to UAS for the entire federal government. Some stakeholders have suggested that DHS or the Department of Justice (DOJ) might be better positioned to address privacy issues since they generally stem from the operational uses of UAS for governmental surveillance and law enforcement purposes. Working proactively to address security and privacy concerns could help prevent further delays in UAS integration. Finally, non-military UAS GPS signals are unencrypted, risking potential interruption of the command and control of UAS.

Pretty good Wired-level read, above average on the tech, but

censorious lawyers and immoral publishers.
While that is not news here, Greenberg managed to breach

Personal stuff allegedly revealed by Greenberg's "characters"

Other points on DMCA notices:
There is a growing racket in sending invalid DMCA notices.
Many are bluffs to intimidate alleged violators not familiar with
requirements for validity (validity itself is wide open to abuse
under DMCA law).
There are firms trolling for copyright notices who send phony
DMCA notices and then notify the copyright holder of a catch,
with an invoice. Unwary copyright holders think this is a good
thing until they read the invoice.
A DMCA notice sent to an alleged violator alone is not sufficient,
it must be sent to the ISP which is required to notify the alleged
violator for a response.
ISPs get innumerable DMCA notices as fishing expeditions and
are pissed at the unsubstantiated fakery which instigates an
automatic, human-free process. DMCA law permits the fakery
and puts the burden on the alleged violator to prove innocence.
A non-response is considered an admission of guilt. DMCA
advocates love this guilt-presumed method.
Innumerable alleged violators ignore the spam bluff DMCA
notices with no adverse effect -- except the spam may
continue. Do not answer the DMCA notice sender, respond
only to an ISP notice.
The obnoxiousness will continue until DMCA is overturned,
notifier throats are slit by info-liberators (metaphorically, please,

with direct exchanges replacing rapacious middle-persons, and,

Inquiry about emissions at NSA UDC and other data centers
was not for external capture but about internal protection from
its own emanating equipment. In particular EM interference by
the big generators at most of the facilities, electrical sub-stations,
processing racks, cabling, switches, personal devices, whatever
is used to run the operation and whatever might be deployed by
those hoping to capture inadvertent emissions by land, air, sat,
mobile. If you will, what does NSA do to capture such emissions
from data centers to data gathering and for unique signatures?
This is not likely overlooked by NSA and maybe at the other
burgeoning worldwide data centers, but what that protection
might involve, ie, Large-scale TEMPEST countermeasures,
somewhat larger than a nuclear submarine, maybe closer
to large-scale array used to snoop on global EM and radio
signals, mundane and heavenly. as with the NRAO.
We have an interest in snooping on the emissions and

Comsec experts should not be surprised at the Snowden
revelations about NSA so far, most of which are venerable.
What is surprising is their seemingly exaggerated surprise
because many of them worked at or ran firms which were
known to be heavily involved with official spying through
dual-use technology and dual-purpose contracts.
With USG and world governments, with banks and telecoms,
with comsec, software and anti-virus firms, with universities
and research institutes, with FOI organizations and public
interest advisory boards, with vulture investors, TED and
Aspen, with revolving doors among goverment, industry,
education, journalism, banking and Wall Street, with RAND,
NRL, the national laboratories, to name a few.
In most instances these dual roles were not hidden.
Or were they?
What might be troubling about Snowden's possible
revelations that is causing exaggerated surprise of
these experts is the disclosure that the dual-uses
and dual-roles in spying were more extensive than
has been made public. That has been protected by
highest secrecy about to be breached, not about
the spy agencies but those used to camouflage
and assist the spying by downplaying its pervasiveness
by selling protection that could never be wholly
effective, that the cybersec game was as rigged
as gambling.
That the backdoors, vulnerabilities, holes, faults,
and errors were more craftily hidden and exploited
with the complicity of the best and brightest while
they deluded the the public for market share and
FOI fame. That it was a charade to agitate for more
security and privacy while undermining them. That
Snowden has the documents about that ancient
betrayal and will at some point make them available.

by rushing to claim the spying has been greater

communicate, supplemented with unlimited other
ways which do not require email, or for that matter,
the Internet or any digital means.
Presume that digital means are the easiest to fuck with,
sorry, subvert, corrupt, pack with junk, surveil, harvest,
store, search, forge, track, make your own list on your
digital device and expect it to be violated accordingly
and used against you whether you know or not, usually
not. Here especially.
Now the other means, non-digital, ancient and amply
used and understood among those who use them
although susceptible to the digital vulnerabilites if
considerable more difficult:
Plastic arts
Graphic arts
And much more everybody uses with greater facility
than digital emissions.
Note that conventional lanugages are not on the list
because of the heavy reliance upon them to communicate
and thus most heavily scutinized and attacked, usually
Language is like metadata, with only its mastery the content
can be followed from end to end, then the ends burgled,
beat, cut, shot, persuaded to talk in plain language.
Steagonagraphy is not on the list unless it is non-digital,
and if not, then hiding communication has great potential.
Its weakness is finding a means, non-digital, for preparation
and transceiving.
For example, architecture is an ancient means of communication,
among its funders, designers, builders, maintainers, destructors,
restorers, investors, evaluators, burgler, surveyors, surveillors,
protectors, attackers, underminers, repairers, materials suppliers,
excavators, and a host of participants -- the list of guilds and unions
and professionals is vast -- perhaps one of the largest cohorts
of quasi-private aggregations on earth lagging only farmers
if taken to mean any form of human construction. I flatter
myself, so do yourself likewise.
Similarly, just about any specialty of human intercourse has
its quasi-private, esoteric, unique means of communication.
The human body specialists -- scientific, shamanistic, soulseeking --
along with its pschobabbling corollary, generates a fantastic
array of marketable, if not wholly, believable garble and
gibberish. Politics and law the most vivid at laying on the
self-serving shit about the necessity of government and
the rule of law(yers).
Now back to the simple task of communicating in private.
Before that, a side note, the end is near:
First do not expect anyone to believe anything using the
word "security." So comsec is dead due to abuse. Maybe
compriv is better, understanding that privacy has become
a crock of shit too.
"Shit bag" (thanks to Assange) Natsec needs to go as well
because it has been abused the most of all since assuming
the parmount importance of a secular religion prevailing
over all belief-systems with deadly weaponry, heartlessness,
amorality, criminality and unaccountability, motto: fuck with
it and you will die. Much evidence of motto in deed. And
much evidence it will be used against its insiders.
This is relevant to private communication. Natsec really
hates being cut out of any kind of communication. It
will use virtually unlimited means to get inside, most
of them kept secret and manifestly violent if needs
So compriv should not be promoted as capable to
exclude natsec's prying, stealing, owning, using to
demolish with its opponents. OTR is futile, BTW,
as comsec.
Wind compriv down to comchat. Then wind comchat
down to comgossip, to comwhine, comjoke, comlie,
comlurk, comslur, com-social engineer. You get the
point. Do nothing life-threatening or natsec defying
by com-whatever. Communications is owned by
those who provide its means and they are owned
by extremely badass natsec ritualists willing to
barbecue your beloveds to share the goodness
carefully prescribed in their secret manuals of
unlimited warfare.
In conclusion, there you have it, com-bat, the most
reliable means of communication. Anything less is

It should be remembered that most, if not all, the UN members
spy on one another. UN embassies and consulates in NYC bristle
with antenna. The US embassy, a high-rise across from the UN,
overlooks the mother ship and the wee boats huddling close.
It was rebuilt a few years ago to get rid of the old tech and install
new defenses and offenses.
The area is a thick web of spy operations -- residences and offices,
sidewalkers and waitpersons, limo and taxi drivers, maids and
doormen, janitors and sex partners, UN staff and renovation teams,
construction, health and environmental inspectors.
A privtate TSCM wizard active in NYC and DC and several other
spy nests, claims no spot on earth is as heavily spied as NYC --
the UN, finance, corporate HQs, FBI, DoJ, whorehouses, the lot --
that the spies respect each other's need for a bye if discovered,
returning the favor by reporting few misses and many successes
as a survival courtesy.
And that that is the back-scratching MO in national and financial
capitals and mil-econo-gov bastions everywhere. No secret to
cryptographers and network operators.

Lance's message size is quite interesting for its parallel to size of
files used for stego and other hiding means. For example
a large CAD drawing of nuclear warhead can be graphically
shrunk to the size of a period and that period placed at the
end of note or under a line in a drawing of a Michael Graves
teapot. The giveaway is the file size.
Fragmenting the warhead drawing for placement in many
banal drawings would help, and that is being done with
a variety of cloaking tools.
To hide the file and its size, the compressed CAD drawing or
CAD-reduced encrypted volume on easy cracking of AES or
burgling AEC labs, like the old microdot, can be transmitted
in barrel of oil, a bottle of perfume, a condom of cocaine or
false fingernail.

Emitting signal that "crypto works" is a hoary practice, nothing
more useful than a belief in an uncrackable means of comms,
used often in war and commerce and love affairs. Crypto-AG,
AES, PGP, Tor, OTR, offline exchange of keys, the list is
growing with each disclosure that something stinks in crypto
Getting the best and brightest (BAB) to affirm that crypto works,
say by open and limited competitions as well as by confidential
testing results leaked, would be a part of that campaign.
Leaking other forms of attack, like metadata, would be another
part, bit by bit, authenticity heightened by obligatory redactions
and vetting by quiet government consultation.
Presume Snowden dribbling juicy comsec architecture and data,
witting or unwitting of their ulterior purpose as beautifully
crafted to appear suspicious to BABs but so tasty to be irresistable
as a floating British officer corpse stuffed with secret war
plans retrieved by the Germans.
Until all of Snowden's booty is released and carefully studied by
virulently suspicious and paranoid BABs not snared by sweet
contracts to muse and declare authenticity, it cannot be seen
as more than an ingenious ruse, likely with the complicity of
the BABs once believed to be poorly-paid angels dancing
on a pinhead.
The saluatory benefit of these ruses is to shock the shit out
of the lazy and arrogant comfuckers whose stake is put at
risk by being left out of the ruse, not easy to do if they are
lulled into complacency by admiration, handsome pay,
invites to classified dances, insured and pensioned by
NDAs, well, hell, why else raise a ruckus with ruses like
crypto lists and fora and history confabbing at NSA.
None of this is intended to impugn the few BABs who
remain outside secret circles, or at least appear to do
so in best and brightest ways. And don't invoke a hoary
NSL as basis for silence.
It does intend to impugn denial of the inevtiable
failure of crypto alone or in concert with infrastructure.
Remember that 1997 NSA paper foretelling the fail.
Was that a ruse too?
If I was a BAB looking for a edge on the competition
for ruses, I might blurt that crypto deception is the
essence of crypto, that is why it works so well.

directly in special ops, any more than most military members
do not engage in combat. So they are terribly displeased when
the exposed war carnage breaks the bubble of prestige and
admiration bestowed on the whole clan for recruitment,
pensions, awards and ceremonial burial. NSA had a relatively
clean record, compared to other spies, until the fan was
hit with Snowden.
Snowden learned that working for a spy or military contractor
under guise of ennobling public service is a shock at how
badly hires and ex-officials are treated: produce and fulfill
new contracts damn quickly or get the fuck out. So he got
All the perks of official service are no where to be seen,
and being shit on by bosses is much worse than that of the
non-secretkeepers who can abuse with impunity on behalf
natsec. To earn the dirty-work salaries means to eat their
shit, no valor, no medals, no pride, just shameless profits.
Which is why quite a few go back into official service after
a taste of raw capitalism always rotting. And, not least, why
even more adjust their ethics and morals to fit what the
corporations expect for predator-grade dollars a year.
Thus, millionaire Michael Hayden, who led the privatizing
initiative with a gang of venal directors and is reaping
payola for demonizing Snowden. And so is Alexander
preparing a place in that select TS/SCI Codeword crowd.
Infosec-comsec firms and experts play this duplicity game
exceedingly well, feet in both camps, hands in both pockets,
via dual-use tech and contracts, and it is to be expected that
evidence of that classified duplicity is being withheld by the
Snowden information managers, aided and abetted by those
very experts in lawful business corruption and deception,
protected by secrecy. Clues repeatedly proclaimed
by the press outlets: officials ask, demand, threaten,
don't publish names, addresses, emails, contractors'
names. Kiriakou and Hammond await you.

crowd for future rewards by way of irresistable offers.

Ongoing debate on whether its better to hide government
informers or expose them. They want to be hidden, their victims
want them exposed. Customarily the victims don't win due to
superior PR of informers and those who pay them.
One case of harm has received attention lately. A lot of
attention, as if an orchestrated campaign in parallel to
the Snowden affair dominated by massive withholdings,
redactions and fragments while claiming large numbers
of files in reserve -- a hoary dissimulation practice of
those complicit with officials.
Beyond that, those who get control of sensitive material
deputize themselves to redact or hide, with appreciation
of authorities, not understanding they are usually less
capable of comsec and judgment than official holders.
They are blinded and corrupted by the bright jewels
suddenly coming their way.
It has been seen that the sensitive material from both
Manning and Snowden was breached rather quickly.
Literally under the noses of the defenders by Lamo
and by Miranda, perhaps others not publicized.
Recipients rush to consult experts as if those experts are
not cooperating with officials covertly under contract or
as informants like Sabu, or are themselves less capable
at comsec and judgment. And also blinded and corrupted
by being consulted about matters only imagined heretofore.
Experts are expert at duplicity one and all.
In the Manning and Snowden cases, recipients were
quickly shown to be unprepared for handling what came
to them, compared to say, reporters, researchers, writers
and scholars who had long experience.
In both cases, the original leakers had unreasonable
expectations that amateurs (we believe in amateurs
over professionals) would rise to the occasion, could
handle the pressure of acclaim and attacks, could
protect the leakers, could manage the information
release, could protect the information, could be
as good as the leakers with much superior training
and discipline.
Not so, under allure of media celebrity the schemes
fell apart for Manning, maybe for Snowden. For this
the leakers had no training only the shallowness of
news reports about who to share the material with.
Even now, the battle goes on, with accusations of
harm to those identified in leaked material by WikiLeaks
shaping the release of Snowden material. Little attention
is given to what failed in handing material to notorious
persons without grasping their limitations and the risks
posed by that.

Proceeding with novel comsec investigations, the New Yorker
this week has an article on plant communication and intelligence
and how they differ from those of animals.
Plant signaling with chemical emissions was intriguing, as were
signals sent through proxies such as insects.
Plant perception of hazards, sensing sources of water, light,
air, nutrients, kin, enemies is suggestive for veggie comsec.
And all this is based on being tethered to the ground, immobile
thus having to do what animals do by different means, barely
perceptible to animals, slow moving, but effective in competing
with other plants as well as animals.
Darwin wrote the seminal work, but current scientists are
deeply involved in what some call "neurobiology" in which
brain-like activites are accomplished by vegetable swarms
of signals and networks without animal brains. Albeit root
stems searching for water and nutrients appear to behave
like brains below ground, while veggie sex occurs above
This raises the prospect of using plant capabilities in
emissions of chemicals and finding nutrients in signaling,
SIGINT, comsec, infosec and crypto.
Has anyone seen reports on this? Or on chemical transceiving
for comsec? Public key as a plant with unique biological
identity which absorbs or emits decrypt signal? The use of insect
and chemical proxies?
An amusing account is that of a CIA polygrapher claiming
to exchage signals with plants, discovered by hooking up
a polygraph to them. He said he could just think of burning
a nearby plant for the plant to initiate defenses. His claims were
later discounted but remind of the long-running mind control
research by US and Russia. And the unkillable kudzu of
lie detectors.

Looks like a joke, right?
Rigging the whole site for https would require labor
beyond our diddly life-support system. And cheat the

But there's more to this than sloth. Cryptome does
not offer security on the premise -- learned here, there

Internet, telecom, whole wide world users need to
learn, be forced to learn, to provide their own security
and to never ever trust those who promise it for them.
Sysadmins and website operators spy viciously, all of them,
and it is a villainous -- business-like -- to offer security in the
same way spies do, as lure, trick and trap. Whenever a

Interesting ovelapping dates for Bidzos' participation in RSA and Verisign.
Does the alleged tampering with RSA extend to Verisign? We use a
Verisign token. Is that suspect?
James Bidzos is president and chief executive officer of Verisign. He also serves as chairman of the board of directors and has been executive chairman since August 2009.
As the founder of Verisign, Bidzos is an Internet and security industry pioneer whose accomplishments include building RSA Security into the early standard-bearer for authentication and encryption, and launching Verisign as a company in 1995 to develop the digital certificate infrastructure for Internet commerce.
Before returning to the president and chief executive role in August 2011, Bidzos served as Verisign's first president and CEO and also served as Verisign's chairman of the board of directors from April 1995 until December 2001, as vice chairman from December 2001 to July 2007, and as interim CEO from July 2008 to August 2009. Bidzos served as president and CEO of RSA Security from 1986 to February 1999, and then served as RSA's vice chairman from 1999 to May 2002.
Recently, Bidzos was inducted into The National Cyber Security Hall of Fame. He is also one of Time Magazine's "Digital 50" and is in CRN's Computer Industry Hall of Fame.

References: A characteristic of plants is that because they expect to
be eaten, they do not have vital organs, and regenerate
parts taken.
Thus, if a ciphersystem expected to be broken, it might
be able to mend the break, sacrifice parts to protect the
whole, without disclosing full content.
Surely there is a sytem that already does this. Multi-level
security may be close.
That a plant cannot move but depends upon absorbing
nutrients in its locale or delivered by movable actors --
insects, wind, rain, animals, other plant seeds -- might
also suggest a way to protect static machines and
Surely that is being done.
In both cases parts are sacrificed to movable actors who
are deluded to believe they rule over lesser beings which
they cannot understand.
So where are the eatable broken crypto which regenerates
itself without giving up full content, and networks which
are protected by use and traffic passing through? Tor might
be close to the latter for protecting content but the

Brian Carroll rightly expands the discussion of pervasive targeting by
ubiquitous technology.
In architecture, for example, the increasing use of automation
for controlling building systems -- HVAC, electrical, plumbing,
security among others -- poses considerable vulnerabilities
beyond legacy analog controls. Many of the automated systems
are administered remotely over telephone, cable and
wireless networks. Others are controlled locally within
structures. Some are secured with encryption but many
are not. And few are TEMPEST-protected outside military
and governmental facilities.
We have found that few architects and building engineers are
knowledgeable about building automated systems nor the variety
of means to secure and protect them. They are customarily designed,
operated and maintained by specialty firms not traditional
building designers.
Moreover we have found that building management and
maintenance staff rely upon outside firms for advanced
technology, thus subjecting their facilties to unsupervised
interventions by outside personnel who may themselves
be sub-contractors, and sub-subs for each component
of automation.
In short, it is fairly easy to interdict and access building
automation systems for implanting devices, injecting
packets, tampering with OSes, siphoning networks,
temporarily suspending security, all the things recently
revealed in the 30c3 presentations.
Digital security and TSCM experts are familiar with many
of these vulnerabilities but there is a common practice
to specialize in services (often at client request) and
neglect comprehensive coverage. For example, to inspect
communications and security systems but not HVAC,
plumbing, electrical and automation systems which often
have far more inadvertent emitters and transceivers contained
in extensive components throughout a structure.
NSA TAO and the joint CIA-NSA Special Collection Service
are especially capable to expoit these gaps, and usually
send teams composed of experts in each building system
to determine a comprehensive attack on vulnerabilities,
and shrewdly, planting multiple and various decoys to
mislead counterspies.
A catalog of these full-scope operations would be quite
informative and perhaps diminish the effectiveness of
ruses and decoys, in particular the kind of solo operation
valorized in movies, books and TV.

Has subquantum crypto attack been substantiated?
arXiv:quant-ph/0203049v2 12 Apr 2002
Subquantum Information and Computation
Antony Valentini
It is argued that immense physical resources  for nonlocal communication,
espionage, and exponentially-fast computation  are hidden from us by quantum
noise, and that this noise is not fundamental but merely a property of an
equilibrium state in which the universe happens to be at the present time. It
is suggested that non-quantum or nonequilibrium matter might exist today in
the form of relic particles from the early universe. We describe how such matter
could be detected and put to practical use. Nonequilibrium matter could be
used to send instantaneous signals, to violate the uncertainty principle, to distinguish
non-orthogonal quantum states without disturbing them, to eavesdrop
on quantum key distribution, and to outpace quantum computation (solving
NP-complete problems in polynomial time). ...
6 Eavesdropping on Quantum Key Distribution
Alice and Bob want to share a secret sequence of bits that will be used as a
key for cryptography. During distribution of the key between them, they must
be able to detect any eavesdropping by Eve. Three protocols for quantum key
distribution  BB84 [20], B92 [21], and E91 (or EPR) [22]  are known to be
secure against classical or quantum attacks (that is, against eavesdropping based
on classical or quantum physics) [23]. But these protocols are not secure against
a subquantum attack [7]. ...
E91 is particularly interesting for it relies on the completeness of quantum
theory  that is, on the assumption that there are no hidden elements of reality.
Pairs of spin-1/2 particles in the singlet state are shared by Alice and Bob, who
perform spin measurements along random axes. For coincident axes the same bit
sequence is generated at each wing, by apparently random quantum outcomes.
The eavesdropper cannot elicit any information from the particles while in
transit ..... because there is no information encoded there [22]. But our Eve has
access to information outside the domain of quantum theory. She can measure
the particle positions while in transit, without disturbing the wavefunction, and
so predict the outcomes of spin measurements at the two wings (for the publicly
announced axes).12 Thus Eve is able to predict the key shared by Alice and

A lot of earthwork was done to create a flat site on a mountain side

No indication of underground construction except pits and trenches
under the buildngs. With none on the surface there must be trenches

windowless envelopes made of panels and flat roofs without
various rooftop ductwork, grilles, piping and the like which appear
on roofs of other NSA and TLA facilities which might emanate
signal although not likely. (Some are littered with the stuff which
might be decoy.)
Steel structural framing is shown at Utah despite its known transmittal
of inadvertent signal, compared to say, reinforced concrete, metalized
fabric or synthetics. although are ample countermeasures available.
The pairing of structures at Utah, two of each type, data center,
generator, AC, fuel tanks, etc., show redundancy also not seen

The odd bent shape of the site plan, with buildings not parallel to

Quite a few recent government buildings avoid the traditional
rectilinear site planning of buildings long considered to be most
cost effective and authoritarian. Some like NGA HQ, NSA Utah
and several at Ft. Meade look almost byzantine in layout, if not
a shrewd design to limit echo, amplification, richochet, or best,

corporate labs, bountifully government-funded.
Lavabit and Silent Circle, apparently shutdown for advertising

Unfortunately, the same goes for eager participants in payback,

allegedly used by Sabu to ensnare and imprison a batch of

Still, recognize that hammering Hammond is meant to be
sickening, as with Manning, Anonymous and Lulzsec members.
In every case rats were coerced into incriminating others by
threats of doing to them what was done to Hammond. If nobody
is ever hammered the threats are not taken seriously.
At a HOPE panel on informants, several hackers disclosed
those pressures to rat, some succumbed and were let off,
Emmanuel Goldstein admitted it, some refused and were
jailed, Bernie-X, Kevin Mitnick. All agreed it is far worse to
go through than you think. Goldstein estimated 25% of hackers
are rats.
Barrett Brown is on the hot seat right now, being offering deals
to rat, as customary, with three (!) trials postponed to maintain
pressure. Shit, even his mom was used as a fed provocation to
misbehave then as a persuasion club as were Sabu's nephew
and niece.
Anybody with a high profile is targeted, so beware publicity
hounds crowing of derrying-do and urgings by high profilers
who may or may not be in the grips of the feds, and if not,
will soon be due to their publicity narcosis, and then used
as clubs or head to jail for obstruction and recidivism or
some other nut-squeezing -- even in jail they are offered
deals to rat and sentence reduced.
In or out jail the pressure to rat continues, as with Adrian
Lamo. Ex-cons never know if an overture is an LE sting or a
an honest request for advice, so they rat to be safe -- recall
they are obliged -- forever -- to report overtures, just like
ex-spies remain under the gun to rat for life. If you haven't
been there don't imagine you know what it's like.
Don't imagine this list and others like it, chats, OTRs, TOR,

About Jim Bell (he can speak for himself but I know best
how to smell and tell a rat):
The IRS secret agent leading Jim's chase, Agent Gordon, lurked
on cypherpunks for a long time, gathering names and addresses
to subpoena for Jim's grand jury probe and (first) trial. Several of us
were subpoenad along with cpunks records from some (John Gilmore
one of those). Some, like me, were summoned both for the grand jury
and the trial held in Tacoma, WA. (Sidebar: youngster Declan
McCullagh covered that and I urged him to report seditiously
enough to be sent to jail to build his rep -- he politely refused
to cellmate Jim.)
Short story (full account in the archive) is that not many supported
Jim all the way when the shit came down, indeed, brazenly ridiculed
his adventure, presumably to cover their ass from Agent Gordon
and co-lurkers always on duty hereabouts.
Who secretly ratted Jim at the grand jury remains unknown but their
behavior and sweat odor has been profiled by god and they will not
be given authentic bitcoins, only fakes with their undercover UID

The NSA SIGINT Strategy 2012-2016 pretty well covers all the
comsec and crypto initiatives to covertly exploit people, cryptographers,
anonymizers, informants, planted spies, security firms, networks,
governments, nations, friends, lovers and citizens.
Not sure leaks, lawsuits and protests will deter this bounty of
profits for the comsec industry, unless the public is aroused to
demand the 3 branches grasp the nettle, and all those making
money from this deception operation decide to give up their
profits, perks and prestige.
I mean those on the comsec and crypto lists, those participating
in standards committees, those enjoying contracts and grants in
think tanks and universities, those in law firms and public interest
orgs, those in the media and academia, those in non-spy gov agencies,
pretending to be in opposition as they scramble to rejigger their
products and sales pitches, to exploit what is being fabricated
to diminish Snowden's revelations with new forms of secrecy,
technology, law, regulations, bribery, lobbying, grants, contracts,
list lurking, online and offline spying, break-ins, the usual kaboodle,
to assure the NSA goals are fulfilled.

The most common for of spying for all countries is that for
assuring payment of taxes. These agencies have dossiers,
agents, informants and contractors (tax lawyers) which put
the other spies to shame (and put as much fear in the oft-blamed
spies as in citizens).
In the US the main function of early spies was to catch tax
evaders. Not to overlook that the birth of the US was about who
got the bloodily-extorted taxes.
No greater cooperation among world governments exceeds
that for catching tax evaders. The few refuges stings.
Tax laws allow far greater intrusion than those for national security.
And terrified citizens are obligated to spy and rat themselves,
family, neighbors, bosses, co-revolutionaries in particular.
Taxpayers are paid bonuses for spying on and ratting each
other, and jump to obey tax obligations, albeit with an acceptable
amount of shaving the truth. Bribes are endemic, whistleblowers
deputies of the state.
Presumably the fashionista excitement of bitching about the
rest of the spies is aimed at curring favor with the most
persistenlty threatening of the TLAs which will swoop in
like the angel of death to remind of the inescapable collusion
of both death and taxes to meticulously spy on futile efforts
to wiggle out of what is due.
Discussing this topic can get a citizen is more trouble than
viewing kiddie porn or whatever is the country's favorite
fashionista criminalization
Fortuitiously, terror was invented to payback tyrants for their
overdue abuse of taxation; today, shilled as sequestration.
Before being forfeited into submission Let us now honor the
two brave and revolutionary cypherpunks sent to prison for
defying the top spies of the way over-taxed earth.

limit harm to governments by harming the public.
Both: provide the documents in a publicly accessible
depository as well as narrate their significance for those
who prefer readers digest and authoritative guidance.
Right now, DocumntCloud provides this depository, holds
over 400,000 documents provided by "authenticated"
journalists to substantiate their reports and to share with
others. Nearly all of the Snowden documents are on file there.
Researchers and other journalists want to see original
material for their own edification, interpretations and
uses. And to balance the inevitable bias and lack of
understanding common to all of us. Bear in mind that
readers digests, narratives and editorials are entertaining
fiction like "news."
Similarly, WikiLeaks initially provided copious documents as
back-up to its commentary. And still does despite an uptick
in exhortatory narratives. So does Federation of American
Scientists, National Security Archive, Public Intelligence,
Crytpocomb, and dozens more, some very old, other new:
This dribbling of documents is a moneymaking scam which
may increase in harm by concealing information that puts
people in harm's way, not the spies and their agents. Or
worse, choking the flow is required by a confidential
negotiated agreement or policy to test the market, test
the USG response, vet with governments as most major
newpapers do "to limit harm" a code word of complicity.
At one point early on Greenwald says he considered setting a
web site for the documents to be called NSADocuments.
It is not clear what led him to go a conventional monetized
route with the Guardian. Nor the conditions under which
WaPo, O Globo, Der Spiegel, New York Times and ProPublica
were brought into the stream.
What is annoying for the special purpose of this honorable
list of understatement is the braying about encryption as if
that is now mandatory PR to show comsec responsibility.
Nothing about the well-known weaknesses of encryption, its frequent
failures, its backdoors, its extremely misleading marketing,
its long history of many failures and few successes, its
use for entrapment and tracking, its customary snake
oil claims, its recantment by original authors, its cover-up
by original authors, its hopelessly fuck-up state at the

A useful invention, or discovery, similar to that of public key
enryption, would be to devise a means to communicate such
that no communication, as we now know it, would actually occur.
Consider what ineffable thought led young Whit Diffie to imagine
PKC. He says it came to him at one point, not altogether believable
at first, thinking there must be a fault somewhere, if valid surely
it had been figured out before. As we know, it had been, by
the quiet Brits, and kept top secret.
What else like that is going on, has gone on, will gone on, all
the while evading classification at birth, not patented, not yet
institutionalized in secrecy madhouses hoarding the best and
brightest, as we know those terms of entrapment.
Consider that a non-communication ineffability has been invented,
or discovered, or is gestating in one or more young minds not
yet regimented by too much education, too much experience,
too much jaded skepticism, too little imagination, too much
comfort of reputation, salary, prizes and pensions, too much
blind faith in technology or mathematics, too much secrecy
as we know them to be crushing of novelty and waywardness.
For example, if the non-communication required no physical or
electromagnetic means but was based on say, conviction, or
concepts, or ideas, or imagination. The message would be
intuited, let us say, or grasped by deduction or induction, or
simply was shared without obvious effort except perhaps
an urge or yearning or desire or hunger or passion or insight,
or why not go for it, love.
Turns out this is not all that unusual. It is rather commonplace
if not ubiquitous. Animals do it, so do vegetables, and probably
minerals, though that is hard to say for sure, perhaps a volcanic
eruption or earthquake or asteroid is passing along content
as well as metadata.
Thought, perhaps faith, exchanges content by ineffability.
The arts, perhaps theoretical if not experimental science,
do too.
Brian Carroll has been exploring these possibilities for
some two decades. If he, then others, most of them
little known, not on the list of comsec wizards, not on
lists at all. That could be what keeps working at the level
of the successors to Diffie  -- and the Brits silenced

Love and Math, by Edward Frenkel, is reviewed in tomorrow's

"Frenkel believes math deserves to be an integral part of our
culture. Why is every­one talking about planets, atoms and
DNA and not symmetry groups? For one thing, you cant
get cancer from a mutation of a symmetry group. But
Frenkel writes that math 'directs the flow of the universe.'
Its as elegant as music and as much a part of our
intellectual heritage as literature. He strives to awaken
our wonder by taking us on an equation-packed tour of
his research, in which he reveals a hidden world few
of us encountered in school."
Returning to Whit Diffie musing on what led to his discovery
or invention of public key cryptography -- found in what might
be termed a hidden world of mathematics -- there may be
still hidden mathematical forms of communication that
does not rely upon technology's inevitable comsec failure.
The NSA global invasion appears almost wholly based on the
failure of technology rather than mathematics, as our esteemed
cryptographers remind. Much of the current tweaking and
further invention appear driven by technology, code,
engineering, politics, law and polemics, again not mathematics.
No wonder, that, for math is beyond grasp of those who
believe the non-mathematical is too hard to see, hear, smell,
touch, write, understand, market and melodramatically
induce media delirium by way of officially-hostile and
unauthorized disclosures.
Whither the NSA bountiful mathematicians in protecting
its family jewels of invasive technology? Stuck in crypto
labs musing like Diffies in manifold hideways?
Frenkel's linking of love and mathematics is worth pondering
in the face of the megalomania, demogoguery, popularity and
profitability of faultly technology, ever breeding abuse, counter
abuse, blame and exculpation, feeding the market for official
joined to unofficial invasion and combat, collateral damage

DigiCert's base standard is to use 2048-bit keys in secure SSL certificates - that is enormously stronger than anything Lenstra et al attempted, in fact, it would require factoring a 617-digit number. RSA Labs claim (see:  that 2048-bit keys are 2^32 (2 to the power of 32) times harder to break using NFS, than 1024-bit keys. 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 or almost 4.3 billion, therefore breaking a DigiCert 2048-bit SSL certificate would take about 4.3 billion times longer (using the same standard desktop processing) than doing it for a 1024-bit key. It is therefore estimated, that standard desktop computing power would take 4,294,967,296 x 1.5 million years to break a DigiCert 2048-bit SSL certificate. Or, in other words, a little over 6.4 quadrillion years.
In putting together our video, we estimated the age of the Universe to be 13,751,783,021 years or a little over 13.75 billion years, therefore if you tried to break a DigiCert 2048-bit SSL certificate using a standard modern desktop computer, and you started at the beginning of time, you would have expended 13 billion years of processing by the time you got back to today, and you would still have to repeat that entire process 468,481 times one after the other into our far far distant future before there was a good probability of breaking the certificate. In fact the Universe itself would grow dark before you even got close.

How secure is AES against brute force attacks?
Mohit Arora, Sr. Systems Engineer & Security Architect, Freescale Semiconductor
5/7/2012 05:29 PM EDT
Even with a supercomputer, it would take 1 billion billion years to crack the 128-bit AES key using brute force attack. This is more than the age of the universe (13.75 billion years). If one were to assume that a computing system existed that could recover a DES key in a second, it would still take that same machine approximately 149 trillion years to crack a 128-bit AES key.

The clock is ticking for encryption
The tidy world of cryptography may be upended by the arrival of quantum computers.
By Lamont Wood
March 21, 2011 06:00 AM ET
Today's encryption algorithms can be broken. Their security derives from the wildly impractical lengths of time it can take to do so.
Let's say you're using a 128-bit AES cipher. The number of possible keys with 128 bits is 2 raised to the power of 128, or 3.4x1038, or 340 undecillion. Assuming no information on the nature of the key is available (such as the fact that the owner likes to use his or her children's birthdays), a code-breaking attempt would require testing each possible key until one was found that worked.
Assuming that enough computing power was amassed to test 1 trillion keys per second, testing all possible keys would take 10.79 quintillion years. This is about 785 million times the age of the visible universe (13.75 billion years). On the other hand, you might get lucky in the first 10 minutes.
But using quantum technology with the same throughput, exhausting the possibilities of a 128-bit AES key would take about six months. If a quantum system had to crack a 256-bit key, it would take about as much time as a conventional computer needs to crack a 128-bit key.
A quantum computer could crack a cipher that uses the RSA or EC algorithms almost immediately.

Tor Project discussion lists have become characterized by a

age and lazy old-timers put down newbies as if a sport,
shooting fish in a barrel, or as in this instance, flogging a

Occasionally, again as in this instance of critiquing Hidden

as susceptible to putdowns as the middling and bottomers,
certainly not as offensive as the Tor Project promoters,
funders and fans.
It would be helpful to distinguish between those who know
onion-routing in depth and those who advocate its use
with what often appears to be primarily public relations and
advertizing disdain toward critics and inquirers.

Tor Project is more like a sales operation for scientific and

pursuing offline endeavors requiring much time for lasting

One clue to unreliability is when a former engineer takes over

marketing tool on fora, at talks, with speeches, articles,
interviews, fund-raisers, documentaries, books, parties,

people. So try as they might to match a word account to
the coders and mathematicians, it's pretty well impossible.
And the reverse is true from the techies to the wordies.
Not many hard core cryptographers are persuasive wordies,
so the wordies often run the public show, in the same way
the hard cores runs the labs and hacker blow-outs with
wearable computers and fuzzy PowerPoints of what a

Keep in mind that even many of the reputable tech reporters

from tech drunken orgies. Same in my field of archtecture:
the highly literate architectural critics know squat of the
down and dirty but excell at reaching the public with
artfully simulated accounts burnishing reputations of
marketable greatness.
In the case of NSA, be damn sure that all its heads
knew or know squat about NSA deep tech so they are
suited to move the product in blissful ignorance to
customers of similar know-not. Michael Hayden and Keith
Alexander are perfect for using vapid words to persuade
non-techies as little truth as possible is just fine.

As head of BT security it is hard to believe that Schneier did not

His NDA with BT would likely prevent disclosing that knowledge
along with protection of his vaunted rep as an incorruptible FOI

I seem to recall that there is an inverse relationship between

have superior ethics over word artists. So a good match
between commercially successful essayists Schneier and
Greenwald. Let the haughty rhetoric gush.
And as Schneier blogs, wise to keep secrets in their pocket(book)s.

References: <20130908114840.GW29404
What is striking about discussion on the two cryptography mail
lists, both set up to minimize discussing political and social
issues to avoid cypherpunks acceptance of them, is the
tentative reconsideration of those issues due to Snowden's
revelations, miniscule as they are.
Notable among those raising the political threat are those
who disdained the issue on cypherpunks and stomped off
to set up alternatives ham-handedly moderated to cease
and desist the "off-topic."
A few now say, bray more like it, NSA has betrayed us
through political manipulation of officials and the public,
and that is an important point which often came up on
cypherpunks and still does, with somewhat less
complaining about it.
For Snowden has shown the political has won out over
the technical, and the technicals are fraught with what to
do about it, and much fingerpointing is going on along with
a few claims of having forewarned this betrayal would
happen. No moderation yet has shut down this "off-topic."
But much gumming and gnawing of the futility of technical
means against the vulgar political.
What has been shown in the discussion is that the
technical wizards are not nearly as competent at the
messy political as they are at technical sophistication.
The resulting conversation is a mish-mash of fairly
high level technical discourse interleaved with fairly
clumsy political opinionating. So technical clubs
are being swung to answer political jabs, that is
petty squabblling and exchange of slurs has replaced
rational discourse. Thus the convo has become
politicized with as much stupidity and ignorance
as sharp thinking and mutual respect.
NSA and its bosses would be happy if this became
the norm in cryptography as in the real world. And some
opine that this outcome is being, and has been in the
past, and will be in the future, orchestrated for just
that result.
That sounds like what cypherpunks was set up
to combat, the withdrawal from politcial affairs into
safe sanctuary of infallible mathematics coated with
unending challengences to implement illusory
protection from political mayhem. So it has come
to pass, there is no refuge from politics, and the once
reviled tin-hats of conspiracy theories are replacing
anomymous masks, especially by the best and brightest
cryptographers who have been hoodwinked far more
than dreamed of in earliest days of cypherpunks.
Still, there are die-hard PR-driven comsec experts
rolling out advice for what to do to protect the public --
meaning, cynically protecting their severely damaged
reputation of "concern for the public interest (R)".
Not yet willing to admit losing the comsec and privacy

NSA Technical Journal published "The Unbreakable Cipher" in Spring 1961.
David Kahn, "Lyen Otuu Wllwgh WI Etjown" pp. 71, 83, 84, 86,
88 and 90 of the New York Times Magazine November 13, 1960
says that an unbreakable cipher system can be made from one
time key "that is absolutely random and never repeats."  ...
For each cipher system there is an upper bound to the amount of
traffic it can protect against cryptanalytic attack. What is
"cryptanalytic attack"? It is a process applied to cipher text
in order to extract information, especially information
contained in the messages and intended to be kept secret.
If some of the information is gotten by other means and this
results in more being extracted from the cipher, this is (at
least partially) a successful attack. If certain phrases can be
recognized when they are present, this is successful cryptanalysis.
If a priori probabilities on possible contents are altered by
examination of the cipher, this is cryptanalytic progress.
If in making trial decipherments it is possible to pick out
the correct one then cryptanalysis is successful. ...
Another example is that of Mr. Kahn, one-time key. Here the
limit is quite clear; it is the amount of key on hand. The key arrives
in finite "messages," so there is only a finite amount on hand at
anyone time, and this limits the amount of traffic which can be sent
securely. Of course another shipment of key raises this bound, but
technically another cipher system is now in effect, for by my
definition a cipher system is a message. A sequence of messages
is a sequence of cipher systems, related perhaps, but not the same. ...
[Answer to the question:] "Does there exist an unbreakable cipher"
would be this, "Every cipher is breakable, given enough traffic, and
every cipher is unbreakable, if the traffic volume is restricted
[End quote]
Is this conclusion still valid? If so, what could be done to restrict traffic
volume to assure unbreakablility? And how to sufficiently test that.

"Cryptanalystis make their living out of sloppy thinking and enthusiastic
over-ingenuity of designers of cipher systems."
Brig. Gen. J.H. Tiltman, "Some Principles of Cryptographic Security,"
NSA Technical Journal, Summer 1974.
Tiltman vaunts the One Time Pad but cautions there have been effective
decrypts exploiting enthusiastic sloppy thinking that OTP is unbreakable.
Most appears to involve non-decipher means and methods. The paper
redacts others presumably still effective.
For amateur ingenuity Tiltman footnotes:
"I remember an early example of the solution of the problem of producing
strictly one-time perforated tape. A Canadian engineer working for a
British intelligence organization in New York who knew nothing
at all about cryptography produced in 1942 an on-line machine called
TELEKRYPTON. He generated his tapes by pouring a mixture of
metal and glass balls through a hopper, the metal halls alone passing
current and perforating 5-level tape. He analyzed the result and saw
that it was biased, owing to the heavier weight of the metal balls, and
then changed the respective sizes of the balls to compensate for the
extra weight of the metal."

The Institute for Defense Analyses, based in Alexandria, VA,
is a 50-year partner of NSA. It has two Centers for Communications
Research at Princeton, NJ, and La Jolla, CA, both doing cryptological
research for NSA:
The latter's web site lists only this offering:
La Jolla Covering Repository
A (v,k,t)-covering design is a collection of k-element subsets, called blocks, of {1,2,...,v}, such that any t-element subset is contained in at least one block.  This site contains a collection of good (v,k,t)-coverings. Each of these coverings gives an upper bound for the corresponding C(v,k,t), the smallest possible number of blocks in such a covering design.
The limit for coverings is v<100, k<=25, and t<=8 just to draw the line somewhere. Only coverings with at most 100000 blocks are given, except for some which were grandfathered in. Some Steiner systems (coverings in which every t-set is covered exactly once) which are too big for the database will be included in the link below.
What is "covering" and how does it related to cryptology?

Stone's is a good statement which correctly places responsibility
on three-branch policy and oversight of NSA, a military unit obliged
to obey command of civilians however bizarre and politically self-serving.
ODNI and NSA have been inviting a series of critics and journalists
to discussions. Most have resulted in statements similar to
Stone's. No such discussions were held after 9/11.
Incorrect to compare NSA to rogue, dirty work, civilian-led CIA
which will attack the three branches if riled. That is the blackmail
looming since 1947.
Greater public oversight of the three-branches is needed, for they
are the rogue, dirty work, civilian-led three LS, protecty by highest
If this can be helped by these invited discussions and statements,
that would be a true advance beyond mere futile debate so far
generated by shallow journalisitic reporting and polemics.
Release of far more of Snowden's documents will be needed
for this to happen, hopefully the whole wad by a means that will
put the technology in the hands of those who can understand
it. So far, the journalists have released only the most useful
to arouse indignation and refuse to release what could make
a lasting difference. Not that journalists should be expected

The CIA is the principal customer of NSA products outside
the military. When global cyber spying Cybercom was proposed
NSA did not want to do it, claiming it exceeded NSA's military
mission. However, the pols, and CIA, wanted that very excess,
in particular for spying inside the US, ostensibly banned for the
CIA but now needed for terrorists inside.
CIA (long FBI opponents) thought FBI could not cope with inside
terrorists, using 9/11 as an example, and advocated NSA involvement
with its much greater technical capability, but more importantly, its
military-privileged secrecy not susceptible to full congressional
oversight, courts and FOIA.
The joint CIA-NSA Special Collection Service (SCS) has
been doing for decades what NSA is now alone accused of doing:
CIA provided the targets, NSA did the technical collection from
those global stations identified by xKeyscore (most in embassies
or nearby).
What is bizarre is how little CIA is mentioned in news furor about
NSA, as if NSA did its work in isolation from the IC and without
oversight of the 3 branches.
SCS also does burglaries, code snatches, decrypts, doc drops,
stings, ploys, blackmail, the panoply of CIA operations. The increased
civilian target panoply bestowed upon NSA came from CIA demands
channeled through ODNI.
Reviewing what little has been released of the Snowden documents
they are quite similar to what SCS has been doing with the addition
of the US as target. FISA had to be rejiggered for the US domain.
Most national leaders, like POTUS, are considered to be military
commanders thus fair game for NSA along with CIA. Nothing
exceptional about the recent revelations of spying on chiefs of
NSA technical collection capability was developed for the
military, not civilian use. Now expanded to CIA full dominance
territory. FISA had to be rejiggered for using it against civilians.
And is still being rejiggered these days.
NSA's recent attempt to slough off Cybercom and return to
its military mission, has been rejected by the civilian overseers
following CIA guidance and fear-mongering of civilians, especially
those inside the US. The last thing CIA and its supporters want
is a revelation of its manipulation of civilian leaders institutionalized
by the 1947 National Security Act (also opposed by the military).

Great that Snowden is getting another chance to speak for himself,
as available on an awfully restricted technical tube-like forum -- so
far only talking head shots at the venues where he has been beamed
in from who knows where, scripted by who knows who from his burgeoning
team of handlers, now joined by EU polopportunists.
It would be even greater if if Snowden himself released or at least
displayed documents beside his head or encouraged the withholders
to do so as the surcharge for their exclusive rigging of ever fewer releases.
Head shotting and paneling by and about Snowden seems to have

"Wrong place at the wrong time."
This is the platinum defense Blackwater and the USG used to excuse
the murders. And the same used for any warfare collateral damage,
strategic bombing of civiians, WMD mutually assured destruction,
law enforcement killings, CIA killings, Mafia killings, drug kingpin
killings, husbands and wives killing of each other and their kids,
abortion killings, gun-lovers killings, slaughter of indigenous
peoples, military slaughter of all kinds -- why the very lament of
every killer who is caught red-handed, blood dripping with
body-armored thrill.
Indeed, this exculpation is taught in the drone operation schools,
top military academies, in special operations and covert operations
schools, in basic training to teach newbie killers to use force
against defenseless targets, in foreign policy universities and
think wankerages, in richest clubs of murderers gulping tankards
of blood-red wine toasting asymmetrical carnage of worldwide
finance, law and religion. Business schools most bloody-minded,
eminent domain and taxpayer subsidy for predation Course 101.
Millions of people have been, are, and will be, slaughtered by
this very rationale of repugnant cowards who are sexually
gratified by obliterating helpless creatures who happened
to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even a small
percentage of the killers suffer this fate, but they are honored
with grotesques displays of bloodless sparkling uniforms,
weeping families, snoring encomiums of sacrifice, luxurious
caskets flag-draped, tooting of bugles and firing of rifles (!),
then dumped in the same ground as their hapless victims
to rot and be eaten by worms enjoying being in the right place
at the right time.

Skepticism of security claims and methods is one of the purposes of

these lists to be used for soliciting befuddled consumers to hop aboard
the gravy train. Now and then skeptcism of the security arises but is usually

Still, Cryptome endorses the continuing struggle to improve citizen
protection, not only as a job, career, industry, but as citizens' obligation
to bear responsibility for the commonweal against its inside and outside

One way to do that is to not oversell it, tone down the threats, reduce
drumbeating, avoid hyperbole for and against, forego advertising,
gang-bang hectoring, circle jerk conferencing, TEDing, prize bestowing,
to quietly invent, improve, critique, test, apply, re-test often, expect to

We have seen quite a few buildings with decent data protection and

of the security of building automation systems often remote from

seldom covers the great variety of buildings.
Some use the same Internet connection, separated only
by software and folders, with folders of the automation system in
obscure locations seldom seen by principal IT data admins.
Different duties, contracts, staff, budgets. Much interest in

surreptiously in secret, not only by contaminating crypto
but by development of bypasses, implants, backdoors,
booby traps, ruses, scams, bribes, dual-hatted contracts
with crypto-hackers.
Can an openly avowed combat on the technologies of political
control (1) work or will it be demonized, fought by secret
underhanded means? Public debate deployed as a ruse in
the 1990s as now.
(1) An Appraisal of the Technologies of Political Control
This combat is about far more than crypto and coders must
be supplemented with all the discplines of science and
technology which are now serving industry and the
"lawful" hegemons.
30c3 advocated a direct attack on these means, not wait for
the public debate to be rigged in favor of the hegemon with
PR, propaganda, lobbying, bribery, contracts, scare stories,
terrifying incidents, the customary dirty fighting and tricks of
spies and "defense" industry.
Is that technological attack on the political, financial, legal
hegemon likely to succeed? Or will the crackdown on
armed (technological) dissent become as violent as it has
in the past?
There is a likelihood encryption will be restricted, by fiat,
by planting weaknesses, by covert attacks, by technological
bypasses, by rigged failures to create doubt of effectiveness.
That was the way CryptoAG operation was run. Now the RSA
ploy is operative. Is the effect of Snowden to be a series
of ploys and ruses. Worse, hop on board the paranoia train,
is Snowden a disinfo op for leaking gobs of ruses?
A singular feature of hegemons is that they are dominated by
"self-regulating organizations" which set the terms and conditions
of the ruling entity, assure enforcement of the rules, and perpetuate
themselves under "self-regulation."
These are successors of royalty which instead of divine right,
backed by military power, they invoke the "Constitution," a law
which distinctively empowers "lawful" behavior according to the
rules of the hegemon.
No wonder the US promotes constitutional government around
the planet, backed by military power, most often by denigrating
other forms of government.
A striking parallel is the rise of the clerics in Europe as an alternative
to religious hegemons. From clerics came lawyerly self-regulating
hegemons. A new religion hidden within supremacist judges' black
Enough of lawful self-regulation in secrecy, unpunishable by
lawful means. Justice is out of control, prison populations stuffed,
bloated law enforcement and spies raiding the public till, private
spies, cops and mercenaries worse than the official, or
Back to the military which backs the hegemons. Technology
controls its effectiveness, thus the need for the hegemons to
control manufacture, distribution, ownership and application
of military means. Concentration of wealth through government
regulation, economic and tax policy, and military supremacy
reifies special privileges and exculpations for the enforcers
of law. Law->taxation->enforcement->informants->spying->
assassination->military action.

The Swartz situation was more complicated than the prinicipal
legal parties involved. A comprehensive legal attack implicated
a slew of people and institutions in Aaron's circle, some who were
frightened into pulling away from him, some of who were forced to
testify much to their later shame and embarassment when that was
made public.
It is not unusual for supporters to run from the scene when pressure
comes down through federal investigators digging into private
affairs, intimidating witnesses, friends and familiies with fruits of
those findings, turning poeple against each other, bamboozling
journalists and publishers who pretend opposition to authority.
Swartz's case parallels what happened to Jim Bell, and to Carl
Prosecutors are highly adept at creating fear in supporters with
grand jury subpoenas for evidence and closed testimony, then
later subpoenaed for trial. This was done with several cypherpunks,
me among them.
During two trials and his imprisonment not a few cypherpunks
came down on Jim Bell, cowardly sorry motherfuckers, some
of them once admired for courage, shown to be candyasses
out to avoid risk beyond rhetoric (as with Manning and Snowden).
Not a few came down on Aaron Swarz, cowardly sorry motherfuckers,
some of them still lamenting the loss of a brave man while hiding
their abandonment of him, stigmatizing his loss of adorableness, his
loss of lovers, true friends and supporters, his lonely withdrawal from
social affairs, his hiding inside his apartment pondering the rest of
his life betrayed by those blaming him for their chickenshitedness.
Swartz died more likely murder, enforced suicide, a killing by
officials and those unable to match Aaron's bravery.
Jim Bell and Carl Johnson were not so easily buffaloed. Although
there continues to be bountiful cowardly motherfuckers who fucked
them as was Manning, as were the Anonymous 16, and will likely be
Snowden, led by the media which takes no chances beyond
rhetoric and hypebole.

If your server or ISP generates log files, as all do, you cannot
be secure. If upstream servers generate log files, as all do,
you cannot be secure. If local, regional, national and international
servers generate log files, as all do, you cannot be secure.
So long as log files are ubiquitous on the Internet, no one can
be secure.
Log files are the fundamental weakness of the Internet
because system administrators claim the Internet cannot
be managed and maintained without them.
This is not true, it is merely an urban legend to conceal
the interests of system administrators and their customers
to exploit Internet user data.
There is no fundamental need for log files, except to
perpetuate the other urban legend, privacy policy, which
conceals the abuse of log files by web site operators
and their cooperation with "lawful" orders to reveal
user data, most often by being paid to reveal that
data to authorities, to sponsors, to funders, to

to inside and outside lawyers, to serial cohorts,

of web sites, to educators of cyber employees,
to courts, to cybersecurity firms, to journalists, to

indicted with the essential help of sysadmins. University and JSTOR

Logs needed run the Internet steadily, securely and cheaply
are not what logs files have grown into: Bloated, malicious,
exploitive and very lucrative spying on users. This is why there
are thousands of firms providing log files exploitation programs
and services. Every product manufacturer touts its spying
capabilities through innocent sounding "log files" ostensibly
serving administrative purpose but then just below that claim
are the burgeoning other uses of maximizing profits.
Log files are metadata of the Internet, the tip of a giant
iceberg of metadata. This is the dirty secret, the family
jewels, of the Internet, carefully rationalized and guarded
by sysadmins. Sysadmins have become the traitors, or
patriots, of the Internet. Traitors against the public, patriots
for the powerful exploiters of the Internet.
Exploitation of bloated little known, behind the public
scene log files exceeds that of all search engines combined.
Exceeds offiical spying in all nations. Indeed, facilitates
spying in all nations for generous fees and to diffuse
understanding of how cyber spying works, who its
architects are, what is the architecture. Snowden hints
are this but so far only pretty facades have been disclosed,
the underlying operation apparently to threatening to "national
security" to be revealed to the public. Sysadmins just adore
being foundational to this architecture of deceit
The argument log files are essential to run the Internet is
a cover for the huge industry which goes right through that
tiny aperture of access to construct an unbelievable spying
operation, far more insidious than that of the official spies,
which as we know merely copy the industry and buy a small

Thanks. We posted the Wassenaar changes on Cryptome
on December 19.
The intrusion software has received some but not sufficient
attention. And beyond the sections you cite there are many
covering other technologies which interrelate and affect crypto.
Those have received even less attention, at least in crypto
world as far as we have seen.
The means to transceive crypto continue to be its Achilles
heel and appear headed toward crippling the whole body -- the
bubble in which crypto exists precariously dependent on
sophisticated support systems which, as seen in the Snowden
minimal releases, have overwhelmed public crypto security, not
least by leaving the impression public crypto was highly effective.
More attention to the support system presumably will be given
as the Snowden releases recommence, now dead stopped.
Greenwald claimed recently  that cryptographers and other
techies are now reviewing the material, much of which is
beyond the capabilities of journalists, lawyers and politicians.
The stumbling block of comprehensive Snowden disclosures
is that to do so, allegedly, could severely damage national security.
Uh oh, that terrible aroma of complicity to protect secrets
too dangerous for the public to know. Instead a few select experts
are allowed to perfomr dual-hat assessments. Which is what has led
to the current imbroglio of public and expert distrust: who watches

Cyber Security Market Forecast 2014-2024: Prospects For Leading Companies in Military, Government, Critical Infrastructure & Private Sector Protection
Defence report
Cyber attacks continue to dominate the headlines, and with good reason. While the threat of cyber security is often exaggerated, there is no doubt that the enhanced networking of society has created substantial vulnerabilities lurking within its interconnected pathways. With attackers able to strike from anywhere and inflict damage on a significant (but often unnoticed) scale, the threat has never been greater to the reams of knowledge held by governments and enterprise. There is also the threat to military information sharing networks representing a significant challenge: in an era of increased integration between systems and platforms, the very webs which act as force multipliers could collapse. Efforts to counter these extensive vulnerabilities are presently ongoing to an impressive degree, and the speed of these developments is not expected to lessen unduly. As a consequence, visiongain has assessed that the value of the global Cyber Security market in 2014 will reach $76.68bn.

Greenwald has said he gets about $1,500 per story in which he
gets a byline. Excluding the $1M signing bonus he has allegedly
got from Omidyar, he has made at least another million.
Gellman, Poitras perhaps the same (Poitras may have gotten a
similar signing bonus).
Other dozens of reporters were paid a percentage of that.
So it might be estimated the gang of reporters have garnered
some $4-5M so far.
Media outlets have probably earned 10 times that in sales and ads.
The USG, allies and enemies have probably received similar
amounts to respond to Snowden, some $50-100M.
So call it a $200-500M affair to date.
If the USG and other govs work the bonanza as predicted,
over 10-20 years the operation will generate, conservatively,
a $1-5T boost for comsec religionists and exploiters of media,
spies, universities, telcos, web operators, program peddlers,
AV magicians, games designers, not counting SM and SEOs
and spammers and botnets.
Black markets could match that amount, or multiples of it.
Meanwhile the comsec industry -- gov, mil, com, edu, org -- will
continue reaping the rewards of faith-based sin and salvation.
Thanks, Ed.

@_subject: Comsec as Public Utility Beyond Illusory Privacy 
Snowden may have raised the prospect of comsec as a public utility
like power, water, gas, sewage, air quality, environmental protection
and telecommunications. Privacy protection has been shown to be
illusory at best, deceptive at worst, due to the uncontrollable
technology applied erroneously for national security.
Each of the other public utilities began as private offerings before
becoming commercialized and then institutionalized as necessities,
many eventually near or wholly monopolies.
Each also evolved into military targets for control, contamination,
destruction, and in some cases excluded as too essential for
civilian livelihood to target.
Comsec as a right for human discourse rather than a commercial
service could enforce privacy beyond easy violation for official
and commercial purposes.
Freedom of comsec, say, as a new entry in the US Bill of Rights
could lead the way for it to be a fundamental element of Human
The problem will be as ever the commercial and governmental
exploiters aiming to protect their interests against that of
the public.
FCC and NIST, indeed, the three branches, are hardly reliable to
pursue this, so beholden to the spy agencies they cannot be trusted.
NSA's ubiquitous spying on everybody at home and elsewhere
with technology beyond accountability does raise the chances of
getting agreement of all targets -- gov, com, edu, org -- to say
enough is enough, national security has become a catchall for
inexcusable invasion of the public realm.

At 11:52 PM 3/13/2014, Troy Benjegerdes sigged:
Your sig: "earth::water::air::fire::mind::spirit::soul" (EWAFMSS)
pretty well covers the area of operations needing ubiquitous comsec
against ubuiquitous spying of EWAFMSS.
Certainly there will be violations and spying by those who design,
run and abuse the systems of EWAFMSS.
Especially those who are excused from accountability to "maintain
the systems, or debug" EWAFMSS.
More narrowly, system operators, network operators, maintenance
staff, repariers, holders of keys to and lockpicks of the systems, ie, the
Snowdens, the spies, the governors, will usurp control and unilaterally
or collectively decide they know what is best for the systems' users,
and that inevitably coincides with self-interest of the system operators
of EWAFMSS.
Given that inevitability of self-interest, cloaked in high-minded rationales
of public service, or national security, what inevitably must be done to
reign in the inevitable abusers of privilege, public service, national
security, ie EWAFMSS.
A range of options: assassination, revolution, counterspying, treason,
war, founding of new faiths, schemes and con jobs in EWAFMSS.
For comsec that could entail implantation of electroshock devices
in every system operator which punishes, or in extremity, kills, for
misbehavior programmed into the widgets. Hack a key, pick a lock,
mosh RNG, open a backdoor, break a vow of public service, get
singed as a warning, keep it up, get fried.
This is basicly what NSA is implanting around the globe in systems
if not witting and unwitting operators. Starting with implantation of
their own Snowdens of devices of disinformation which leads the
poor goofs to think they know the system vulns. Then the goofs
spread the disinfo to, say, the Greenwalds, Poitras's and Gellmans
who then goofily spread it to the public goofiness consumers.
Blessing this operation is the FISC judges who mightily try to
understand WTF DoJ is blowing at them to cloud what NSA is
actually doing with its systems of EWAFMSS.
Read the FISC orders to see the solons gyrate and spasm
a pretense of understanding what is intended ot be non-understandable.
NSA proceeds totally unhindered to do what it wants with abusing
EWAFMSS, condoned by FISC glossing of the abuse -- what is
done in the US is done worldwide for managing and exploiting for
self-interest EWAFMSS.
Yes, these very lists foster the appeal of exploiting the expoitation
of EWAFMSS by pretending to oppose it, to found a new scheme
of assassination, revolution, etc, etc. This will inevitably lead to
compromisable proponents to be bribed and recruited for service
in the established exploiters: billionaires, journalists, lawyers, courts,
tech corporations, telcos, LEs, TLAs, Vaticans, Israelis, Muslims,
Tea Parties, nations, black marketers, financial crime syndicates,
freedom of information hustlers, leakers, and, most beautifully
remunerative, crypto-comsec mofos.
There's the pitch for comsec public utility, crypto-comsec mofos
signing up to be implanted with EM devices for a Tor-Greenwald-grade
lifetime of comfort bribe to loyally and patriotically run the sysems of
EWAFMSS. Then immediately break the vow, hack the devices,
cheat, lie, steal, bolthole an embassy, refuge in a rogue state,
for a while enjoy the warm feeling of triumph, then be Zapped
remotely for belief in knowing more than the Devil in the Details.

Snowden's video, comments and talks at SXSW convey the failure
to aim higher with ubiquitous comsec, instead to remain within the
comfortable fold of Snowden's "do no harm to national security."
This blind faith in natsec cautionary implantation in Snowden and
his media outlets aided by technical advisors and officials, assures
redaction-rich risklessness in accord with the NSA-DoJ-bamboozled
FISC orders guaranteeing continuation of control of EWAFMSS.

A point not well emphasized by cryptographers, in public at least,
and advocates of encryption as the essential requirement for
"Unbeakable crypto" may not be used as much as it once was
but there are a host of newly-minted versions of snake oilish
assurances dominating the booming comsec market, thanks
to Snowden's magnificent gift, estimated to eventually reach
the trillion dollar level in two decades, to the gov-com-edu-org
comsec panic industry.
Operators of systems, and the necessarily breachable security they
offer, remain the achilles heels of comsec. Lavabit is only one of
the instances in which sysadmins are compromised. Ubiquitous
deployment of crypto throughout telecom and cyber systems is
vulnerable to sysadmins who insist on full access to everything
to "de-bug" and run their systems, especially those SAs easily
manipulated by front offices and their ever so cooperative legal and
financial advisors. Not many SAs wil do what Snowden did in the
"public interest" which just happens to be a great fortune maker
for media and comsec hustlers.
End to end encryption is currently a hot recommendation of choice
for comsec but skips over what happens behind, below, around and
inside "end to end" code, hardware, implementation, and most of
all the traffic flow of the precious capsules emitting transceiver
vapor trails, EM clutter, arfully cloaked gaps, doors, handshakes,
implants, bugs (and "de-bugs"), ways in and out, checks, double
checks, safety plugs, sigs, nyms, language hints, and manifold
uniquenesses witting and unwitting of fallible hunks of meat.
It is, or should be, primary for cryptographers to publicly admit
cryptosystems inevitably fail, as some do despite being overridden
by sales and CEOs and investors, being bribed and NDA'd into
complicity, or in worst cases threatened with prosecution for
revealing in natsec systems built-in faults or more deviously,
pretending there are none while glossing deep deception with
shallow claims that there are always a few which can be repaired,
nothing is perfect, you get what you pay for, etc, etc, the
formulaic exculpation inherent in the word "security."
No question this is expecting cryptographers to be more honest
than the rest of the greedy "professional" class so avid to profess
public interest while gobbling the public's hard earned with gleeful
transgression slathered in "industry standards" and global treaties
to assure governments and corporations remain piggish and
dispensaries of rewards for the professional classes which
find oligarchal enticements "irresistable" as Greenwald slobbered
in agreeing to work closely with gov-com to withhold secrets
under guise of ventriloquizing Snowden's "causing no harm to
national security."
"Causing no harm to national security" is verily medieval in its
creed-promotional organized religion fervor. Cryptographers
have long been missionaries for this duplicitous "trust us" faith,
so it figures they will evangelize among journalists to adopt
encryption to upgrade the low value of the fear and trembling
scripture, and, as always, the compensation for scribes of
arcane holy writ of bare panic and crypto balm.

Assume this promotional creed screed for national security journalism:
No, media venality is not news. What is worth examining is the long-term
exploitation of "national security" as a joint gov-com-edu-org
racket to manipulate secretkeeping as a wealth concentration
industry. This has been commonplace since the national security
state was invented after WW2 and led to need for continuous
spying to manufacture enemies and to arm for diddly squat combat
against fictious foes by hugely expensive but hardly ever used
armaments. Cryptosystems among the black budgetary wastage.
In particular cryptosystem popularization (as here and its emulators)
as ostensible opposition to the national security racket, begun in the
flower-child 60s to flower wildly in the 90s and rise to a kudzu crescendo
with Snowden's operation to validate crypto use against illusory
enemies within the state, cloaked as usual by the blanket exculpt
"to do no harm to national security," then hide behind privileged
natsec journalism so dirty and complicit in govenment affairs it
needs protection from the public, so merely dribbles dainty
tidbits of threats to privacy and to advance the favorite ACLU
and EFF lawyerly fund-raising hobgobblin of constitutional
FISA Court jiggery-pokery by lawfare warriors indicates that
lawyers and judges know diddly about comsec technology
but dare not admit it and lose control of the public narrative
of threat and protection obligatory in the trillion dollar national
security hootenany which compares to organized religion of the
medieval era which ruled heaven and earth with fantasticly
frightening and pleasuring tales of evil and salvation.
Adled journalists are racing to adopt encryption as crusading
chain mail raiment, ignorant of how easily it can be penetrated,
but no matter, what will really protect the valiant journalists is
"constitutional protection," a comedy of conceit and stupidity
usually associated with court jesters.

@_subject: Skype and Crypto Pushed by Snowden a Ploy? 
References: In connection with using "encrypted, secure connection" Skype for
Snowden's imagery at SXSW and TED, as well as encrypted comms
with journalists and event organizers, what has led these comsec
advisors to believe that all too vulnerable Skype is secure, as well
as all too vulnerable popular crypto pushed for journalists?
Is there any indication Snowden has deployed less vulnerable
protections which have not been disclosed as backing for his
encouragement to trust encryption and to allow Skype to
finger his location and leak his comms?
To be sure, many of his remarks seem to be carefully scripted
for low-brow consumption characteristic of journalism. So there
may be a secure back-channel being used with Skype and pop
crypto as diversion.
The low-brow slides, clips, short docs, redactions released by the
media point to a deception of some sort yet to be disclosed until
25 years has passed. Hyperventilating press accounts of the
releases suggest either deception, inexperience or technical
ignorance or all.
Still, that kind of misleading comsec deception would be commonplace
security measures characterisitic of NSA and wizards -- to induce the
flock to churn massive amount publicity about encrypted comms --
and Skype -- to camouflage the Tor, blacker and deeper comms,
not to say the even blacker and deeper tools not seen by Snowden
or not yet released.
More sopisticated would be to use the small amount of NSA releases
to cloak far greater distribution (a method used by WikiLeaks and
the black market as well as the spy industry). That too would closer
to what the big boys and girls do, and therefore would be exactly what
they are watching for. Including watching for ploys to hide ploys.

Sys admins catch you hunting them and arrange compromises
to fit your demands so you can crow about how skilled you are.
Then you hire them after being duped as you duped to be hired.
The lead Tor designer reportedly (via Washington Post) had a
session with NSA to brief on how to compromise it, although
"compromise" was not used nor is the word used by
Not many honest comsec wizards nowadays are promising
more than compromised comsec, and the compromise is gradually
increasing as Snowden material is dribbled out to convince the
public and wizards not a hell of a lot can be done about it except
believe in and buy more compromised comsec.
Not news here and in comsec wizard-land, to be sure, but
compromised comsec is the industry standard, as the industry
and its wizards in and out of government enjoy the boom and
bust in comsec tools generated by precursors of Snowden,
Snowden and his successors.
Compromisability is assumed by the comsec industry to be a
fundamental feature in all nations, no need to advertise it, much
better to advertise how great comsec is and now much it is
needed. Crypto-wizards have a long history of compromising
believers who hire them and who suffer their promises of
highly trusted protection.
Trusted comsec is necessary to get persons to pack their
comms with compromisable information. The greater the
trust the greater the revelations of just what is desired.
So what if laws are aleays jiggered to allow access to the
revelations "under legal pressure" and "FISC orders."
That has been a fundamental feature of crypto and
comsec wizardry.

Ubiquitous use of a comsec system is a vulnerability, whether
PGP or Tor or another popular means. Crypto advocates and
Tor encourage widespread use as a defense but may be luring
victims into traps. The more users of a system the more likely
it will be attacked by officials or by malefactors. And the attacks
are most often overlooked in the volume, or excused as a price
of popularity, fixes underway, always underway, keeping coders
and investors happy as engineers mud-wrestling and financiers
Most trusted systems (MTS) are where the money is, as with banks,
so that's where robbers make their living, and MTS set up budgets
for loss, PR, lobbying, training staff in cover-ups and workarounds,
hiring ex-regulators and distinguished industry leaders as advisors,
board members and faces of the MTS around the planet.
The lucrative boomlet in comsec generated by Snowden Inc's
marketing gambit promoting encryption and enhanced comsec
among media mouthpiece megaphones indicates that another
cycle of dubity of the status quo comsec confidence game is
to be followed by a repair and rejigger protection racket,
as evidenced on these mail lists, at conferences, and no doubt
in halls of semi-classified exchanges everready to share tips
and tricks to ratchet up demand for security in all its devilish
Was it not mere months ago when a call was issued to redesign
and or replace the entire Internet from top to bottom, the whole
thing, to end the futile comsec tinkering and delusionary marketing,
no way the Frankenstein could be made secure for human use,
it had fundamental faults which precluded durable comsec.
Perhaps re-Frankensteining is being done in semi-classified
halls, hindered by by official and commercial and scholarly
exploiters of the monster's faults to advance their interests
in advocating MTS for public use, just keep those research
and investment funds flowing.
No risk, no security market, so what fool would want an Internet that
had no faults. No bank would want perfect security to be available
directly to customers. No military or spy agency would want perfect
national security available to the citizenry. No government would
want a threat-free populace. No comsec industry would want ...
Best to aim for pretty good comsec and call it best that can
be done but cheating happens, thank you Edward Snowden,
so prepare for disaster "not if, not when, but now." Intel
committees wokring hand in hand with Snowden Inc. to keep
the public panicky and needful of secrecy protection of
the holy grail, national security backed by WMD.
In short, Tor is a confidence game, crypto is a confidence game,
no better than military, espionage, publicity, entertainment, finance,
law, insurance, education and religion. Oops those are the primary
routes to wealth and power concentration and need for WMD
What, you say WMD is a confidence game? Getoutahere, that's
top secret codeword core faith in secretkeeping. Without that
fundamental Frankensteinian fault nobody would buy security
against the Doctors of monsters working hard at most secret
laboratories on earth to devise crypto for assuring WMD comms
and launch threats are pretty good at persuading the public to
pay the steep protection fee -- which it should be noted is
laundered through IRS and NGOs, blessed by FRS and SEC.

Not only the cyber titans were treated to classified briefings
by NSA but also journalists, a number of them since the Snowden
releases, continuing a long tradition of cultivating amplifiers
and opiners in just about all fields -- com, edu, org, experts,
in particular those in infosec, comsec, netsec and data
And like the titans, the others assure their customers nothing
like that is going on, abiding non-disclosure pacts obligatory
for classified entry to secretkeeping. Dual-hats for dual-usage.
And not a few of these are rewarded not merely with information
but contracts, fees, endorsements, featured product placements
in spy offerings, awards (open and secret), vouchings in setting
of standards, educational scholarships for expert profs students
and research assistants, consultancies, recommendations to
corporations and foreign customers.
What is wondrous about the Snowden releases is that there
is so little about this far broader constituencies which conspire
with spies, invent and promote spy products and services, with
the easy corporate targets serving as camouflage for the ostensibly
good hearts who avow they are on the side of the public.
A distinctive feature of this charade is inveterate lying, as spies
do with pride and vainglory, as security pros must do or die,
threatended to be killed for telling just half of the whole story
as ex-spies do to save their skin.
Whadda you mean, the whole story, are you nuts? The whole
story is beyond belief, beyond revelation, nobody knows it.
It is postulated to make the partial revelations look like a clue
to much worse, a standard spy, ethics, education, religion
business, government means and methods, which happens
to be in effect for Snowden, as with other spies and exes,
titans and journalists, scholars and hackers.

There is a good chance the documents are covertly marked as

Covert markings have been in use for a long time, as well as
ostentatious markings. On paper as well as digital and other
forms of electronic.
And certainly packets carry unique markings in a variety of

This is hardly new, indeed is as old as governments and their
precursor "lawful" rulers of the populace which cannot be
trusted with anarchic self-rule, much less armed with treasonous
cryptoanarchy for absolute right to privacy from rulers.
Even this list of rogues was founded and struggles to survive on
its impossible mission to resist this ancient history and current
fervor of duplicity and dual-use of the ever growing family of

protect the populace by declaring who is insider and who
is outsider, take your pick, save your life. Us or them. Divide

Significantly for this clan, comsec remains an essential tool
for attacking and protecting. It annoys the masters of comsec
no end for rogues to mess with their command and control
communications and ubiquitous civic spying operations.
It requires recruitment of comsec rogues to mess with rogues,
as amply demonstrated here and other security fora where
coders and hackers are prime candidates for quietly switching
sides, remaining in place, covertly informing, sabotaging,
implanting, faulting, I/O erroring, pretending opposition to the

counseling dissidents, whistling Dixie for media and audiences,
advocating openness, disclosing shallow vulns to hide

This list goes on, as evidenced here and on the gobs of

The global internal rot of digital technology dependence appears doing
quite well by inducing ever greater investment and reliance upon
it. Will over-reliance upon secret cryptography be its Achilles heel?
Let us hope so.
Conumdrum is that wholesale monitoring is the result of ubiquitous
digital technology, networks and programs thickly hidden by secret
cryptography, thinly protected, if at all, by never quite effective public
cryptography, ineffective by law by design, by implementation and
by endless excuses to do better next time.
The correlation between the rise of the Internet to advance global
surveillance and public cryptography to persuade the populace there
is hope the surveillance can be countered, is occasionally noted
but not by cryptography fetishists who promote the notion it is possible
to have a global platform of diverse levels for multiple open and
secret uses but still protect at least a few of the levels with encryption.
This despite the legacy of cryptography as a deceptive technology
through and through and foremost, in particular by misleading about
its strengths and weaknesses, its treachery and double-dealing, its
cheating and betraying, its false promises and "confessed" failures.
No doubt all forms of security share these characteristics, eventual
failure is the fundamental outcome of a security system subject to
ceaseless attack. Every fortress fails, every weapon is surpassed,
every peace treaty is transgressed, every ideology collapses, every
nation is overturned; in all cases by excessive conviction that failure
will not happen, and when it does, it occurs by the least expected
means. After a few attempts to repair the majestic defense and
prolong a regime, it finally implodes most often due to internal
rot of those unable to give up comfortable convictions that munitions
are invulnerable, that supreme command and control is protected
against tampering, that oaths and rewards of fealty to the homeland
are insurpassable. Except for the planted cheats of anonymizers
and encryption.

Call for publication of all Snowden papers gets louder
The Amsterdam Media Professor Geert Lovink left no doubt that in his opinion the medium term, the entire treasure of the NSA Whistleblowers must be made and archived publicly. Such an approach has a very different range than the global 24-hour news machine. "Journalists want to make headlines and politics", was the founder of the Institute of Network Cultures . But it was important to think long-term.
The Snowden-papers offer unique insight into a loud Lovink "information-military complex in the making": They showed roughly, "who are the actors and what technologies they use." In addition, they made different impact of monitoring on individual countries or regions significantly and who personally was affected as a group or society. Taken together, this was "for all investigative journalists around the world for decades interesting".
Ruf nach Veröffentlichung der Snowden-Papiere wird lauter
Der Amsterdamer Medienprofessor Geert Lovink ließ keinen Zweifel daran, dass seiner Meinung nach mittelfristig der gesamte Schatz des NSA-Whistleblowers öffentlich gemacht und archiviert werden müsse. Eine solche Herangehensweise habe eine ganz andere Reichweite als die globale 24-Stunden-Nachrichtenmaschinerie. "Journalisten wollen Schlagzeilen und Politik machen", befand der Gründer des Institute of Network Cultures. Es gelte aber, langfristiger zu denken.
Die Snowden-Papiere bieten laut Lovink einzigartige Einsicht in einen "informations-militärischen Komplex im Werden": Sie zeigten etwa auf, "wer die Akteure sind und welche Technologien sie nutzen". Darüber hinaus machten sie unterschiedliche Auswirkungen der Überwachung auf einzelne Länder oder Regionen deutlich und wer persönlich, als Gruppe oder Gesellschaft betroffen sei. Zusammengenommen sei dies "für alle investigativen Journalisten weltweit über Jahrzehnte hinweg interessant".

I have contacted you asking about certain security questions.
After reading a few of the Snowden leaked documents, I have
started to be more aware of my privacy being at risk. I have a
few questions concerning certain programs and safety tips.
First, I've recently started to doubt about my encryption software.
Is Symantec's "PGP Endpoint" a good hard drive encryption software?
In other words, is it trustworthy since it is an American company.
And if not, what encryption software is the best for Mac.
Second, is "ProtonMail" as secure as they say it is? If not, what
email provider doesen't let the NSA see into my account.
Third, is Jetico inc's "Bestcrypt Container Encryption" trustworthy?
If not, what could be an alternative.
Fourth, are these encryption types good? Blowfish, Gost & AES - 256bit.
And which encryption type remains the best above all?
Last, is Kaspersky a good anti-virus software? If not, which one is the
best for Mac.
Important, difficult questions, likely to produce a range of answers.
We will publish for answers.

Capitalizing on the comsec frenzy, several sites, probably many,
are offering to encrypt for those who do not want install programs
or find them too difficult to use. All appear to promise that no
records, private and public keys, email addresses or content
will be kept. Trust them.
For example, here's one used to send encrypted messages:
This approach suggests that the renewed crypto wars have again
bred a new round of opportunities to beguile those who yearn for
comsec but do not know how to get it, nor how to evaluate the
offerings, in particular those provided by US producers which they
doubt are free of government manipulation. But they also doubt that
any cryptosystem is free of that, thanks to the NSA revelations of
global cooperation among nations to do what NSA does, and the
failure of crypto experts and firms to fully disclose their aid to
governments, before and after Snowden's revelations.
So the downside of Snowden's revelations is that there is considerable
suspicion that all crypto is compromised, and, worse, that snake oil
is not really different from the good stuff for the ordinary user who lacks
the technical skills to distinguish them. And that comsec experts are
in league with authorities to dupe the public by excessive warning
of snake oil to peddle their own offerings, that is, experts and
snake oilers are doing what governments do.
Trust Snowden, trust experts, trust governments, but distrust
snake oil. Wait, users say, how can we tell the difference when

and that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down.
Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption
is fundamentally a private act. The act of encryption, in fact, removes
information from the public realm. Even laws against cryptography
reach only so far as a nation's border and the arm of its violence.
Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with
it the anonymous transactions systems that it makes possible.
For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract.
People must come and together deploy these systems for the

article about it. Nor followed games, so the controversy is
new to me. But not the issues involved, which are prevalent
online and off. Particularly in testosterone-rich enterprises like
military, spies, armaments, sports, weapons, ideology,
religion, education, society, civilization, humanity, existence
itself. In all of these, the stronger violently dominate the
weaker and do so with the psychotic belief that this is
the way it should be, natural.
In war and peace, in human exploitation of animal and earthly
domains, in climate degradation, in force-feeding "democracy,"
in cruel treatment of women's bodies and neglect of children,
in just about every aspect of torturous "advancements in
civilized peoples" in the course of inventing and applying
ever greater and more vicious ways to kill, maim, starve
and over-populate earthlings by male rape in all guises
of wargames.
Games are a reflection of the this much greater conceit
of male dominance in all institutions, all of them, even those
which spout diversity and affirmative action and grant minimal
access to privileged male sanctuaries -- no matter the skin
color, ethnicity, faith, location on earth.
It is argued that male aggression inherent and can at best
be somewhat controlled by law and social compact. That is
a comfortable apologia by male supremacists in law and
social compacts dominated by them with intellectual and
economic arrogance. All institutions measure accomplishment
by male-derived standards to tip the balance in favor of those
rigged games.
GameGate is too limited in scope, so much that it should
be seen as a male-dominated diversion, a game, to avoid
addressing the origin and sustaining influence of male
way of thinking, doing, making, competing, surviving, by
lying, cheating, killing, ruling in all aspects of existence,

The NYT-Propublica is an informative and impressive release,
in many ways better than previous. It expands on the earlier
revelations (as the narratives state) with some overlap and filling
in gaps. A good sign the holders of the balance of the Snowden
dump are digging deeper and learning how convey a fuller picture
or at least a more enthralling one for the public while techologists
twiddle thumbs awaiting useful data to devise defenses. (A hint
from some Snowden withholders there may be handoffs to
technologists separate from the public. Schneier, Matthew
Green, a few other comsec wizards aiding publishers have
said as much.)
Hardly complete to be sure, with about 10% of the dump
published, with plenty of gaps indicated by jumps in narratives
and still too many redactions -- presumably the result of
consulting with officials as heretofore disclosed, or due to
Snowen's instructions about what to withhold, either to
"avoid national security harm" or in expectation US prosecutors
might be mollified in the negotiations for his return to the
Most frustratingly, details of the spying technology are
missing with emphasis still on slide shows and textual
summaries -- most likely to satisfy the public rather than
technologists at home and national opponents.
Jacob Appelbaum's and a few others releases of the
technology are the exception, civil liberties and lawful
issues remaining in the forefront of released documents
and much more so for the journalistic accounts.
It might be surmised that staying away from technology
disclosures and featuring 5-Eyes and partners prowess
and comprehensiveness of slides and text serves to
warn the enemy of what's in store without disclosing
information to defend against it.
In particular, Snowden's and associates harping on the
need for widespread, strong encryption use, even though
the documents show how the spies bypass it, undermine it,
use it for deception, implant backdoors in it (as well as in
chips, OSes, routers, nodes, cable stations, server farms,
teleco hubs, virtually everywhere in the global system as
shown in this latest release) should be taken as a warning
encryption is not the magic cape its proponents claim.
This suggests reliance upon encryption may be a decoy to
divert attention from other comsec protection, the old
CryptoAG ploy: The most trusted comsec the most
likely not.
The tremendous rush to market cybersecurity means and
methods for public consumption, combined with 5-Eyes
outreach to industry for means and methods to defeat
cybersecurity, is a wonderful paradox, albeit powerfully
stenching with treachery.
Whether Snowden is more of a hero to the public than to
5-Eyes and its partners is up for future historical debate.

full disclosure of the Snowden dump at the current rate of

Law will always be bent to favor authorities, that is what law
does and why lawyers are given special protection and privileges
not given to the citizenry. What NSA, ATT, Cisco, Oracle, Microsoft,
RSA, Google, ISPs and the others have been doing, and will
continue doing, is completely legal and, if insistent, constitutional
(the ur law favoring natsec authorities), so it is misleading to claim
Mark Klein, like Snowden and most other leakers, has been co-opted
by lawyers, civil libertarians and wealthy donors to speak to their scripts.
If not, then to the poor house dogs.
Nothing wrong with being scriptedly misleading, that is what media
and law do to whatever raw remarks are handed, leaked, "Secure
Drop"-boxed to them ("at own risk of sources").
Nor anything misleading about promising strong encryption and
surefire cybersecurity, despite repeated failures, backtracks,
apologias, tweakings, full disclosures, that is what they do "because
the enemy does" and "we're doing the best we can." No, not national
defense grade protection, are you nuts, RTFM.
Nor is it misleading about civil liberty, privacy policy, anonymization,
open source, HTTPS, the current cipher-sec civil-lib kaboodle.
That is necessary for their survival in the marketplace. "That is
what competitors do and become rich at it, we're sick of being
middling strapped."
What might piss off a pristine, completely guiltless humanoid
coder is the brazen duplicity of the opponents of the NSA cartel,
the enjoyment of perks of being on both sides, wearing dual hats,
citizen-official, dissident-loyalist, open-closed, public servant raking
in high fees for duping the public about forever known-to-be-faulty
comsec, reneging on assurances, duo-dancing on pinheads at
comsec fora with mutually celebrated opponents, advising governments,
tesitfying for governments, taking government contracts, betraying
confidences, fork-tongues a flutter.

Well said on skepticism of news reports concerning crypto, comsec,
infosec, natsec. Disinfo and deception are inherent in security and
survival, and best, most reliable, most trusted are typical tools of
misleading exploitation.
Where a single means and method, such as crypto (or science), is
encouraged for rock-solid assurance, at least one other means and
methods should be employed which in no way depends upon the
single means. Hoodwink wins by cheating.
A single means is certain to be continously under attack, and its
vulnerabilities concealed both by the attackers and by the promoters.
Blind faith in a single means is as old as religion, art and royalty, perhaps
as old as humans faced with unending threats from nature and
mortality -- and most of all from each other's thieving and murderous
practices. Duplicity and con-jobs were essential, along with bigger
clubs and rocks, voodoo and faux-virgin sacrifices -- ISIS hardly
different, except more modest and sane and much less wealthy,
than Los Alamos, The Vatican, JP Morgan, Ashley Madison,
Silicon Valley and the IC all fostering blind faith in their own
advertising of rockefeller-st-peter-approved STD protection.
Some HTTPS Everywheres lately have been advertising encryption
and HTTPS as condoms to protect against Internet STD, aka privacy
rape. Peddlers of these hygienics are surely donors to the of Church
of Crypto whose priests do enjoy the pleasures of insider hoo-haa.

The most poignant moment in the book comes when Popper contrasts a conference for the more ideologically minded Bitcoiners at a racetrack on the outskirts of Austin, where Ulbricht grew up, with the gathering of the rich and powerful at the South by Southwest festival, where Ulbrichts mother is politely dismissed as she pleads for funds to help defray her sons legal costs. It was an unhappy reminder of a side of Bitcoin that its new adherents wanted to put behind them, Popper writes. And as he notes, If this was the new world, it didnt seem all that different from the old one ­ at least not yet.
Nor can Digital Gold be a tale with a satisfying ending, because the future of Bitcoin is unknowable right now. As the venture capitalist Barry Silbert says at a Goldman Sachs conference, Bitcoin is either going to change everything, or nothing. But if Bitcoin doesnt change every­thing, people will keep trying to find something that will, and so Poppers book stands as necessary reading, and very intriguing at that, regardless of the eventual fate of his subject.

Exactly why judges masturbate with a noisy device, snooze, bark

higher and lower judges, get shot, shoot back, get laid and STD

Courtroom tedium (aka justice), procedural churning, empty bombast,
strutting, feigning, farting, fingering anus itch, jury boredom, hollow pretense of
respect for the law -- from this comes little new, and a lot of wasted time,
so obese, privileged, endlessly disputatious precedent is valued over
disruptive lean novelty and Roy Bean quick resolution, wherein fear of mortality
and hard labor are suspended self-sentences, and issuing death penalties
against childhood bullies absconding with therapy dolls is the dream of

Disks or any electro-mechanical device, may not be the only, or
principle, means of storage. So capacity may not be the measure
of capability.
The need for speed of access to and processing of data requires
the data to be in active memory all the time. Arrayed, large CPU-like
"chips" or solid state (best is unsolid state) processors make data
constantly usable, always up to date, no lag time, no wear and tear.
Physical disks use too much energy and require too much architecture
to rack, interconnect, house, energize, maintain, repair, replace, update.
And are way too slow and clunky.
However, this doesn't mean Utah Data Center is not useful as a
Potemkin deception. Or that much of it is Potemkin deception.
Why else make it so observable during funding, design, construction
and afterwards a juicy easily photographed, concentrated target of
sneaky weaponry of hardware, software, sneakerware, hey come

Somewhere, in Utah, or the planet, there are data handlers about
which little is publicly known except as miniaturized examples on
personal playthings. Meanwhile we are fed out of date fantasies of
capability based on xxx-bytes of increasingly absurd prefixes which

One way to spot what's what is to look at the generators of facilities.
And their fuel tanks. Fully active data require a lot of uninterruptable
juice. We traced the power lines for UDC and found they lead far

Analogy of learning to drive to learning crypto is pretty good privacy.
Extend that from needing a key, fob or fingerprint to start a vehicle
to needing a computer and a device, token, card, fingerprint, to
encrypt. Plug it in, encrypt begins, nothing else needed except
driver license, intelligence, vision, hearing, gasoline or battery,
safe roads, directional signs, fuel stations, cops, insurance,
anti-theft devices, annual inspection, license renewal, or when
disabled, poor or broke, terrified of mass killing excessive
vehicles, alternate means of encryption, like buses, trains,
aircraft, ships, taxis, limos, choppers, subways, balloons,
horses, feet and sidewalks while packing a gun, knife or
pepper spray for defense against predators, rapists, thieves,
rubber hoses, hackers, crackers, dopeheads.
But maybe a profession of encryption officers to encrypt for
the user, like lawyers, doctors, engineers and notaries, state
licensed for protection of customers, self-regulated because
nobody would know crypto like the pros, with a crypto system
like the justice and prison systems to assure accountability and
punishment for infraction. Would require outlawing crypto use
by anyone except a pro and official secretkeepers but, cereal
box DIY would be available. PKC would be banned as a state,
church and family offense, like kiddie porn and WMD.
Cryptographers would be venerated as high holies, sack clothed,
wild haired, slit-eyed, filthy, babbling, narcissitic jerks, abusively
sado-masochistic, panhandling, duplicitous, feared, contemptuous
of ordinary humans, ostracized, distrusted. Woe peddling obsessives.
Hmm, that last is the current faith in encryption religion. Could be

Hillary Clinton Showed How the Government Still Doesn't Understand the Encryption Debate
This is the agreed upon script for national security, encryption, commerce,
education,politics,religion, since the Internet was invented and long before.
But neither safety nor privacy have been satisfactorily provided during the
time this script has been incessantly spoken, written, broadcast, legislated.
Crypto advocates as well as those for national security have conspired to follow
a script that both agree cannot be fulfilled. Edward Snowden is merely the
latest to preach this impossible dream so successful, lucrative and risk-free
by advocates and marketers of crypto and natsec.
None of the opportunistic companies and cryptographers marching in lockstep
to this script with authorities expect the dream to be realized, so they agree
to keep repeating the sales and dangerless script for doomed-to-fail national
security and encryption and then demand more funding and trust for better
Whether doomed to fail is deliberate to assure markets, media and lecture fees
could be debated, and will be debated, and is being debated. This debate
fosters the notion of opposition rather than complicity. As seen in the
Snowden affair, dribble non-threatening information, call for debate,
pretend risk-taking in consultation with authorities.
So Manning and Snowden and a few others are left hanging in the wind,
in jail, in exile. The smartest and least gullible are on the run, keeping away
from publicity and foolish leaking, avoiding honey pots of secure drops
and ratting to law enforcement and spies, and disbelieving anyone who
promotes and monetizes the script of safety and privacy. Nobody like
that is here nor on any fora on crypto and natsec suffused with tattletales,
fora run for that very purpose.

Snowden is to be pitied for believing giving material to the press to do with
what it likes is a victory.
Giving all material to the press for its mediation, interpretation and
monetization, as well as consulting with representatives of government
on what to publish, hardly changes the status quo of representative, rather
than direct democracy.
Snowden and the press are complicit in withholding the alleged material
he took, even now the public does not know and may never know what
that material consists of. The soup has been contaminated by editorial
selection, redaction and interpretation. That may be inevitable with the
sordid process the press calls leaking ("wikileaks" compounds the falsity
of censorious and editorially regulated pubic participation -- wiki -- and
exploitive, biased, corrupt, dramatized disclosure -- leaks).
Withholding material by self-empowered representatives, whether Snowden
or the press, self-regulating lawyers, stock peddlers and other professionals,
is a variation on official secrecy by which secret keepers pad their income
and perks so long as they abide the cult of secrecy. All this has been
done in the Snowden affair, as well as Ellsberg's. Those who don't
abid the cult go to jail, or ruined financially, or stigmatized for life.
Even now the representatives of the government, NGOs ACLU, EFF, MSM
and Freedom of the Press are negotiating a deal for Snowden for his return
to the US, following the Ellsberg precedent. The USG appears to be willing
to make a deal with all sides claiming victory "for the people." When such
deals are primarily beneficial to the secretkeepers and interpreters and

over followers, and the crippling narcotic of believing public interest is the
same as privileged party interest, and worse, that the concomitant rewards
of being somebody publicized is superior to being out of sight working
hard to undermine archies of all stripes -- oligarchy of the Omidyar type
currently underwriting the Snowden sweettalking of NGO field bosses
overseeing booty distribution handsomely paid by tax write-offs.
As Snowden tweets, he's a director at Freedom of the Press. That is,
still among the privileged insiders of loyal opposition. As here.

HTTPS has become a fetish, maybe always was. It serves as an end point fig leaf,
simulates privacy and infosec, but does not protect visitors from the full stream of
access to their traffic end to end. Same for shallow, exculpatory privacy policy
always "taken very seriously" laughingly. So encryption and anonymization provide
decorous couture of genitals while leaving the rest bare assed.
Web sites are insecure by the very design of the Internet which allows operators
and administrators full access to traffic "so it can be maintained properly." That
is policed and spied behind misleading signs of safety like HTTPS and privacy
policy. Every web site operator knows this and keeps it quiet to avoid scaring
away visitors. So they adopt the latest fig leafs and earnestly promote them
as essential while hacking and spying predators continue to ravage the Internet
as if the planet was created for the benefit of warmakers and their engineers

We've encouraged Best to continue doing what he is doing after using Cryptome
as a platform, counsel and source of information. He did set up a website, did
mirror the Cryptome archives, did do further research and announce it widely
and has picked a fight with several parties, complained of mistreatment,
censorship, abuse, exposed collateral innocent (ha!) parties.
We also told Best log files are the dirtiest secret of the Internet, none are
secure, none private, none singular, admins and websites lie about using
them, exploiting them, deleting them, needing them, stealing them, accusing
about them, inflating them, rigging them. They pay for the Net, thus not ever
going away or kept secure.
So Best is going in the tried and true direction, many others have staggered.
And if determined he will avoid depending on anybody for support. More power

Cryptome's offer to sell itself and logs for the amount Omidyar
is tax writing off  at The Intercept, and skying the donation for its archive
to the weekly stipend of top Snowden exploiters, is a parody of
what highly-profitable web sites like e-Bay, ISPs, equipment, program
and cybersecurity peddlers, and net operators and overseers are doing.
Access, traffic and transaction logs are ginned, sorted, stored, munged,
manipulated, sold, stolen, and more, all along the many packeting, hops,
boosts, diversions, conversions, hand-offs to various devices of the route
from user to destination. End point of user and the destination is merely
one bit of data, well, two bits, with gobs of bits quietly being gobbled
elsewhere, camouflaged by the delusion of privacy policies, anonymization,
and website log deletion or never ginning logs.
Cryptome has no logs, never has. Its various ISPs have copious logs of
many kinds (not just the simplistic access logs meant to delude website
operators), along with all the other transceivers of visitor activities and
transaction metadata and metametadata.
Cryptome has never run a server, just buy the service. We do track our
ISPs' activities and through them the ganglia of the Internet to see what
happens to our files.
Voracious bots have always been the heaviest users of Cryptome, siphoning
files hourly, daily, monthly, then providing them to users at other locations
to gin their own families of data for sale to govs, coms, edus, banks,
investigators, investors.
Google, Bing, Internet Archive, Torrent, drops, govs, spies, academics,
researchers, cyberseckers, take, steal actually (as do we), Internet files
for their own use which is primarily to gather data on users, the precious
jewels of the Internet which underwrite its so-called free service.
Public benefit aggregators like Internet Archive, Wikipedia, Google
docs, universities, NGOs, are the prime abusers of visitor data, both
to their websites and by special privilege of advising visitors on how
to protect their privacy while being pickpocketed of personal data.
Cybersecurity con artists are as bad by deluding their visitors and
customers about how to protect themselves with encryption, Tor,
anonymization, OTR, secret chats, deep web, blah, blah. All these
con artists gin their own logs of trusting-users data, then either
hand it over to authorities, sell it covertly, share with cohorts
and standards orgs, write papers and give speeches soliciting
customers, testify in Congress and courts, inform grand juries,
cut plea bargains, brag about resisting NSLs, set up warrant
canaries, share tips with donors and investors, yadda, yadda,
do donate generously, but best, generate taxable income,
tax write-offs, never-ending war, paranoia and FUD.
Cryptome has no privacy or security policy to deceive visitors, and
periodically announce that, and warn not to trust us or any other
website, especially those which advocate HTTPS, anonymization,
privacy, security and crow about civil liberties and public benefit.

References:  <20160222094811.GC2454
Snowden did the right thing, as he said, released the whole wad
to the public. Just released it to the wrong few people with no
technical capabilities but with desire for personal recognition
and profit-taking. Heading to Hong Kong "Greenwald and Poitras
danced in the aircraft's aisle upon reading sample documents,"
according to one account by Luke Harding (Greenwald denied this).
Both full release and profit-taking could have been done, and maybe
both were done, that is, the full release has been placed where more
technically capable persons have access. A few technical persons
have had limited access according to news reports, to advise the
cache withholders, but not many which is highly regrettable.
As we said in the interview there are a host of parties with greater
skills and experience publishing classified documents, National
Security Archive and Federation of American Scientists, among
them. Granted that these orgs are quite cautious about publishing
unauthorized disclosures due to their boards having close ties
to authorities and dutiful legal obedience.
No question the methodology employed by favored journalists
has been effective for engaging (entertaining) the public. The
comsec and credibility problem is that the small number of
documents released (~11%) and large number of narratives
(>100/1 of document pages) has skewed and dramatized the
disclosures such that it is impossible to know how accurate
the fragments are without access to the full wad.
Now there are rumors that the bulk of the documents may be
returned for Snowden's exculpation, which would be a great
loss for the public but swell for Snowden and his PR team.
Short shrifting the public by the media where leaks are concerned
has become, maybe always was, the norm. Direct to the public
disclosure, un-mediated, is what is needed, no secretmaking
privilege to anyone. Journalists bristle at this, claim the public
must be told what to think, and in this journalists are just like
Moreover, that Snowden allegedly requires the cache holders to
check with USG before release is pernicious, maybe false. Quite
a few of Snowden's comments appear to be scripted by those who
have him over a barrel.

Apple's fix of its devices to prevent access by outsiders surely is not like CryptoAG in which gov entry was secretly implanted. How to verify this has not been done? Political and technical challenge is that few users care about security and privacy, they just want convenience and latest style as Apple has become richer than Croseus exploiting. And Apple is hardly the only com-gov-org promising group identity and solidarity, with illusory security while primarily securing the benefits of the promiser.
Apple and govs are more similar than different and bound by loyal opposition, the very stance most beneficial to security and privacy offerers. Insecurity is the product.

with this phony crypto war is a bit much, though, opposition to government
instrusions around the world have been persistent for decades, especially
against the ever increasing digital violations and forever failing protections
against them. "Strong crypto is hard to do while making it easy for users."
What is most needed from the Snowden 90% still-secret wad are defenses
against the USG now that alarms have been repeatedly clanged about redacted
and incomplete offenses. Most peculiar that almost no defensive measures
have been released, although Snowden may have insisted on not releasing
those as threats to US national security.
Snowden's alleged demand that outlets check with USG before releases
to assure no national harm is institutionalized in national security
reporting, but is also required by fear of prosecution of outlets and
their investors such as Omidyar, Slim, Bezo, all the major media.
Withholding the 90% of Snowden material which he claims was given
to the public, is damnable betrayal of the public for monetary and
professional benefits. In this way the Snowden material has been
handled like the USG handles it, as if it is owned by the handlers,
not by the ones who paid for it.
It would not be off-base to accuse the Snowden handlers of what
Apple and the USG are doing, engaging in a fake fight "in the public

End-to-end encryption is reliable only if it begins and ends without
use of computers and networked transceivers and devices, operating
systems and systems administration, electromagnetism and
algorithms, ISPs and packets.
Each of these are vulnerabilities, not unlike Tor, anonymization,
VPN, OTR, any method widely promoted and recommended.
The more widely known and adopted the less like to be secure.
So Facebook fails the same way Crypto-AG failed, and those
developed in between.
Cybersecurity is on a roll, given extra boost by Snowden releases
(limited as they are by his "do no harm to the USA") and his
continuing boosterism from protection of the other world
policeman out to make sure no encryption is invulnerable.
Currently all states are promoting limited cybersecurity in various
see-through couture but never disclosing what the states use
for hiding most-secret comsec. Snowden, among many in
the ballooning cybersec field, never advocates full disclosure,
and in that ancient way, protect their state-sanctioned privileges,
in RU as in 5-Eyes.
Facebook is regulated by the USG and through it other nations
so not likely to place its survival above that of customers. But it
certainly uses the language of customer protection pretty much
identical to all the 74 amici which jumped on board Apple's
grandstanding fight against USG, settled secretly.
Official secrecy continues to be the primary vulnerability of
cybersecurity and public comsec. No nation can survive
without it, nor can any state-regulated entity.
Without top secret code word privilege nobody is secure.
And those with that privilege willingly harm the populace
by lying and cheating and disinforming. Snowden fits that,
probably entrapped to do so by his media handlers who
dare not challenge the states which privilege media.
