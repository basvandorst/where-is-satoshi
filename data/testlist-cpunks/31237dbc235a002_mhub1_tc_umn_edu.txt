@_subject: True democracy in America. 
A truly Democratic society is only feasible when you have an educated
society that can act outside of their own self interest.  Take a look at the
ancient greeks,  they voted to put socrates to death because he questioned
their power and beliefs.  In a democratic society you must be accepted by
the majority in order to survive.  Think about all of the greatest minds in
history, most of them were very controversial.  A democracy is just the
tyranny of the majority.  I think that Americans are typically smart enough
to have more of a say in politics and believe that we should move to become
more democratic, but not to go so far as to become a real democracy.
