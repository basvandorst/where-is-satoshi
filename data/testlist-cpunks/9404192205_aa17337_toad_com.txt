Storm/Shield/Sweep.  Before the network was in place, people were using a single channel radio relay box called the Hadron.  It was capable of being used with the KY-57 (crypto) on the PRC-77 (single channel radio), as well as satcom (PSC-3).
coordinated with Quantico, VA, so that the supply cycles, and requests could be sent in real time.  Not every Marine tank was a Banyan server, networks were installed down to the regiment HQ level.  Remote shots were done over MUX lines with KG-84 as the crypto, on a four wire leased circuits.  This allowed for secure communications within the theater of operations, as well as unclassified communications with the rear (stateside).  A number of different ways are available to the Marine Corps to talk to remote spots, and new ways are being found all of the time.  If there is further interest, I would be more than happy to post further to the list.
