@_subject: CALEA options for a small ISP/ITSP 
I have a CALEA appliance from BearHill that I 'rent'.  It has been in my network for years.  I'm looking for other alternative solutions for CALEA compliance with a small ISP.   It looks like OpenCalea is a dead project.    What is everyone else using?
My current solution is $1k/month and I rarely get subpoenas, I've never had a wiretap one.
My ISP network is a mix of Cisco and Juniper gear.   I have a couple GigE connections to my upstreams and push 300-400mbps through the network.
I would think that wireshark pcap files would be enough :(
