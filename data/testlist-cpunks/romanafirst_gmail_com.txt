@_subject: Help with JPEG Stego app? 
I've decided to upgrade my project, Stego, conceived as  an easy-to-use, near-universally available, maximally browser compliant, message PGP encrypted, steganography web app, to encode JPEGs, the most universal image format today (in cell phone cameras, and all over the web). Which means I have to decipher information-dense papers, pick a suitable algorithm, and code it up in client-side Javascript. Which greatly increases the workload, but I expect I'll be a better engineer for it. It also means that I'll be reusing none of the original code. Fortunately there are a few open source Javascript JPEG libraries. I'm writing to ask for help with picking the stego algorithm, hoping that someone here has a knowledgable opinion. Romana Machado

Here's the Javascript PGP library I've chosen. I expect the 128 bit setting will be sufficient. Comments welcome as always. Romana Machado

Awesome, thanks! Why was old school F5 chosen vs QIM or others? Romana Machado

Mo, I wish your student great success. I will definitely take a look! I expect the UI for a plugin to  be quite different to that of a web app. I've chosen not to build a plugin or a single platform app for obvious reasons, though it is nice to know that there are efforts in these directions that may assist my own in part. Here's the plan to create ease of use: taking note of the UIs of existing tools, collaborating with experienced UI designers, and making use of an extensive background and contacts in UI test.
