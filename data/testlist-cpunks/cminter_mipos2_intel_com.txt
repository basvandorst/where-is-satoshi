Forwarded message:
exactly.  watch out, some DoJ revisionist might get into your mirror
site and get you back for trying to keep a history of the incident :).
well... maybe not.

@_subject: new "obscenity" law on the net 
what if I had written some code which doesn't function properly unless
certain indecent words were in the source code and then put the code
on the WWW :).  Would that violate Congress' Despotic Action? What if when you looked at the text on a 80 column screen and because
of line wrap it said something indecent otherwise it was
unintelligible?  It seems that no reasonable person would go after a
person for that but then aren't we talking about selective

@_subject: Concription [NOISE] 
if there is nothing more to concription, then it sounds like a bogus
patent since PGP documents and implements the technique already. Maybe it would make a nice trademark though.
Does anyone know if macaroni and cheese combined in one meal is patented?  If not, maybe I can go out and patent it. :)

Better yet, specifically point to those who should be held
accountable and list the names, addresses, email address, etc. of all those who are involved.
Even better, where practical build into the software an option (that
you could turn on/off) which would email every piece of information
that you encrypted directly to the congressman as a kind reminder of
their position.  [This is a joke: spamming is not a good way to deal
with the issue.]

ok, who wants to help me market my new tunneling router software called "Chinese Firedrill".  I believe it would sell well in China's
black market.

@_subject: I don't think I'm on the mailing list anymore.  What's going on? 
I'm not getting any more mail from this list.  Does anyone know
what could have happened?
Maybe it's a CDA crackdown :)
If anyone knows could you email me directly?

@_subject: mail list / sequence number & signature 
Have the list maintainers ever considered either or both of the
(Sorry in advance if this has been brought up sometime in the past.)
o adding a digital signature from "owner-cypherpunks at toad.com", so
  someone can't mass mail the mailing list and make it appear that
  the message came from toad.com.
    I just tried to figure out if the id in the header is in any order
    but I couldn't tell.  I have already deleted many messages so some
    numbers are missing anyway.
o adding a sequence number to every message which comes through
  toad.com, so recipients can easily notice if mail is be
  accidentially or intentionally filtered by their service provider or
  any other forces.  At the same time, you could add the current
  numbers for flame vs.  non-flame.  This would help end all the
  bandwidth wasted on people speculating about the numbers.
    say there are X total messages, Y non-flames, and Z flames then
    the appearance to subscriber (either in the subject or some
    header field) could be...
                                list
        type      | all                 non-flame           flame
        ----      | ---                 ---------           -----
        non-flame | X (non-flame Y)     Y (all X)
        flame     | X (flame Z)                             Z (all X)
