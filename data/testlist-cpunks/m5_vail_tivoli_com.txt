In the "is this weird or what?" category, I came across something
fascinating in the December 1993 issue of "Smithsonian" magazine.
In an article by John F. Ross about ventriloquists, an outfit
called Maher Studios in Littleton, Colorado is described.  Maher
is a major supplier of ventriloquism "how-to" books and tapes,
including "Maher's Home Ventriloquism Course" ($79.95).  In it
are revealed (quoting Ross) "secrets of the art, information once
kept closely guarded by the now defunct International Brotherhood
of Ventriloquists".
The proprieter of Maher Studios is a middle-aged (judging by his photograph) man named Clinton Detweiler.

CBS's "60 Minutes" had a "Oooh Scarey" segment about the Global
Positioning System last Sunday.  The scarey part is, according to 60
Minutes, that any old terrorist government can now put together
accurate guided missles and wreak death and destruction upon our
homeland.  The crux of the problem is that the system broadcasts out
positioning information to one and all indiscriminately, and according
to the show there's no way we can stop it.
Because my mind is regularly exposed to wild conspiracy theories and
all sorts of crazed paranoiac ravings (i.e., I read Usenet), I started
thinking that this is rather unlikely.  I speculated that the
government may in fact have designed the satellite systems so that
they could be told to do several things in case of national emergency:
*	Shut down (probably possible; they may have actually mentioned
this on the show).  Problem is that lots of friendlies may grow to
rely on the data for life-critical things, like guiding commercial
*	Shut down normal transmission and begin strongly encrypted
transmission.  No mention of this; apparently, the satellites were
originally designed with some sort of weak system that made the data
difficult to use for high-accuracy purposes, but that's been defeated
(by the FAA or someone contracted thereto).
*	Enter into a bogus-cleartext with encrypted subchannel mode,
where the plaintext is slyly made to be wrong, but using some
subchannel encrypted "good stuff" is still available.
I don't know much about how this system works, so I don't know whether
any of my thoughts are relevant.  It's probably most likely that the
government indeed blasted these things up into space without
considering using encryption technology to enhance security.

In light of a conversation (not a private conversation; it was at an
EFF-Austin gathering) with Mike Godwin in which he stated that the
court has ample precedent to cite you for contempt upon refusal to
produce encryption keys, I think it's clear that no decypherable
encryption scheme is really adequate to protect private materials
during a legal investigation.  Similarly, I suspect that a scheme to
protect information by automatic destruction or obfuscation (as a
friend described it, "digital flash paper") would be considered
illegal obstruction of justice.
Therefore, were I to be in possession of information that for
political or business reasons I strongly required absolute privacy, I
would resort to physical security as the closest thing to a sure-fire
solution.  Back things up onto high-density tape, and keep the tapes

I understand this, but could I be cited for failure to produce
evidence not known by the court to exist?  (Clearly, I could be so
cited if the evidence were ever discovered.)  Is there a process that
the court can use that says "hand over absolutely all artifacts
pertinent to the case at hand known to *you*, whether such artifacts
be known to the court or not." ?  Or is it the case that failure on my
part to offer up such evidence is inherently contemptuous?

My suspicion is (gee Mike, you're right!  I *am* a lawyer!) that in
such cases the court makes a judgement as to whether a particular
claim of forgetfulness is credible.  If the information in question is
clearly critical to the life or livelihood of the person being
subpoenaed (is there a legal term for "person being subpoenaed"?), the
claim that the key has been forgotten is likely to be disbelieved.  Of
course, the court might say "Ok, gee, that's too bad.  I guess it's OK
then if we just hold these floppies under this head demagnetizer."

I think that Mr. Frissell's suggestion falls into the category of what
I've humbly termed "digital flash paper" mechanisms.  In the days of
yore, numbers runners and gangsters and nefarious bad guys would keep
records on cellulose (?) flash paper which could be ignited and
destroyed very rapidly should Elliot Ness be seen approaching the
front door.
Another (simpler) suggestion made by a friend was to devise
motion-sensitive devices which would cause total corruption of
information stored on a disk if it were moved.
My highly esteemed legal opinion is that this could be considered
criminal obstruction of justice, though as with the contempt of court
issue such a charge might be preferrable to one of Sedition :-)

suppose, and just keep a .forward file there.  Of course, if one stole

Though I agree with some other contributors that iron-clad
identification may require substantial amounts of material, I think
Mr. Ghio's point is correct to the extent that a party can satisfy
itself informally that a particular anonymous post is from some
well-known identity.  Though the evidence may be useless in a legal
sense, that's not a problem in some contexts.
For example, if Bob Scum is posting anonymously some risky notes to
a particular mailing list or newsgroup, it may be quite unfortunate
for Bob if mere suspicion arises that the notes are from him.  That
suspicion need not be based on admissable-in-court evidence; if it's
noted by someone that both Bob and the anonymous author routinely use
the word "copacetic", things could heat up for poor Bob.  If the risky
notes involve some socially unacceptable topics like drug use or
pornography, the fact that Bob can't actually be convicted is
unimportant. Mike McNally

Gee, that seems pretty amazing.  On a typical workstation, there's a

it quite unlikely that there's a practical way to predict or recreate
a configuration.
Then again, I could be wrong.  I also wonder how, if the above is
true, one can really get 128 bits of entropy from keyboard timing
(especially from a small number of keypresses).

I guess that's what I consider the amazing part.  Right now, I'm
sending mail via emacs.  I'm doing a big "make" in another window
(oh, it just finished).  I've got a FrameMaker session up.  I've got a
bug tracking database up.  I've got 4 local xterms and three rlogged
in to other systems.  I've got the Sun calendar tool running, and a
Lucid emacs window from another host.  I've got my own dynamic
X root window toy running.  I've got Tivoli's product up, I think, and
some other people are doing unknown things through that as part of a
test cycle.  (Yes, this ELC is maxed out.)
Given all that, it's hard for me to believe that some nefarious party
could be tracking system state thoroughly enough to be able to
reconstruct the contents of /dev/mem at any given time.
Of course, I could be thinking non-rigorously.  I suppose that,
strictly speaking, the blizzard of activity on my workstation gives me
no *real* protection.  Seems odd, but I guess I really can't make that

However, it seems to me that it's an open question in this discussion

Ok, this is really getting bizarre.  Why is it so hard to accept that

to the noble souls who operate FIDOnet nodes out of the goodness of

Perhaps some of the confusion stems from ignorance on my (and,

Uhhhh...  That's the *point*.  It is a waste of time and energy to
prohibit anonymity/pseudonymity when it's so easy to render it
completely ineffective through the use of strong cryptography and
digital signature technology.
Note that if it weren't for the fact that humans can use sensory
mechanisms to determine with some confidence the identity of a human
they're talking to, we'd have been faced with the same problem for
quite some time.  That's one of the foundations of the whole

By whom is accountability going to be required?  How will it (or how
can it) be implemented?  What sort of mechanisms can be expected to
reliably and universally evolve in the decentralized anarchic network
we know today that will make "paying the price" a meaningful concept?

I think that it's always important to keep in mind that manufacturers
of things like copiers & printers are primarily (almost exclusively!)
interested in one thing: profit.  If they detect heat from the Secret
Service, they call the legal department to get an estimate on how much
it will cost in direct expenditures and lost opportunity to fight
regulations in court, and simultaneously call the engineering
department to find out how much it'll cost to do what the Feds want.
The smaller number wins.  Though it might remain legal for you to
build your own color copier or dye sublimation printer in your garage,
the Feds would have been pretty much successful.
Seriously: how many Fortune 1000 companies will refuse to buy a Canon
copier because of the serial number thing?  A few might have some
reservations, but since so much material will be identifiable as
belonging to the company anyway it doesn't seem like a big deal.
Canon might even be able to sell it as a quality control feature.

Why does this preclude continuation of net services as they exist
today?  You seem to feel that there can only be one mode of use for
network resources.  If businesses want to use the net only under the
aegis of some authentication/credentialing scheme, fine!  That means I
may or may not choose too participate, or that I may choose to
participate as "myself" while still maintaining other digital
alter-egos for other purposes.

Why are you so stuck on the idea of "cleaning up a mess"?  The network
is a resource.  It can be used concurrently in lots of different ways.
You're free to start up your own set of authenticated services this

Really?  So the presence of paying customers on the anarchic networks
won't be attractive?  We've had experience with lots of nasty problems
on the Internet already, and yet companies are all the time paying for
things like T1 channels for better service.
Of course, businesses are free as they've always been to implement
whatever communications systems they want.  This is old news.

Can someone comment on the efficacy of this technique when used in
conjunction with encryption modes other than ECB, and/or with the
simple XOR "pre-scramble" technique?  I agree that it "couldn't hurt",
security-wise, but of course it does introduce a (slight) processing

Ahh, but recall how The Media operates.  There will come a case

The Media paints as threatening a picture of "the encryption crisis"

I don't know much about modern munitions, but I do know that armor
piercing rounds may have no charge in them at all.  Generally, when a
round pierces one side of a vehicle, it loses enough energy and is
suitably deformed to prevent exit from the opposite wall.  It does,
however, bounce around quite a bit, which can be plenty of fun in a
tank loaded with equipment, munitions, and soldiers.
It was discovered in the second world war that (with then-current
metallurgical techniques) introduction of a high-explosive charge into
the armor piercing round tended to reduce its effectiveness by
weakening the structure.

So, just to clear this up, if you wanted to start a newspaper today,
could you simply print out a few hundred copies of whatever you wanted
to say and go out and sell it (or give it away) without any

Really?  So your only defense against ideas you don't like is to make
the dissemination of the ideas illegal?  Clearly there are values you
rate higher than press freedom.  (That's not necessarily bad, though I
personally don't like it.)
 > I'm sure that american press freedom is not better than german ones.
Sorry, but if you have to go to some office and ensure them you're
following the "rules of newspapers" or whatever, then that statement
is incorrect.  I can this instant decide to print out thousands of
copies of whatever I want, drive down to some public area, and start
handing out my documents (or charging for them), all without a visit
to a government office.  That's not illegal.  Only "pornographic"
material is inherently illegal to distribute (and that irks me, I
assure you) (though not because I'm interested in that line of work).
(I'll leave it to Mr. Godwin to point out the various little laws I
might break doing something like what I described above; the point

It may be that traffic analysis of Clipper conversations is a question
orthogonal to the switching system employed to establish circuits, but
the question remains: does the presence of LEAF blocks on circuits
simplify the task of traffic analysis?  Methinks it does, particularly
as the network gets more complicated.  While it's tempting to think of this as a clever back-door way of
getting some of the FBI "tap-o-rama" proposals implemented, it's not
really interesting until nearly everybody is using a Clipper phone.
Consider this little flight of fancy:  what if, "in the interest of
the privacy of the subscribers", Clipper hardware is installed right
in each end-office switch?  Thus, every phone call is Clipper
encrypted as it passes through the network, even if I don't have a
Clipper phone.  It might even be that Clipper hardware could be
installed right at the network interface.  Isn't that nice, the phone

I'm going to make the almost certainly valid assumption that you know
more about the way the network works than I do, but my assumption is
this:  in the wacky scenario I described wherein Clipper devices are
installed in the network interfaces "everywhere", then the presence of
these identifiable (and identifying!) packets means that a central tap
at a regional switching center could concievably perform traffic
analysis without the need for taps on local loops anywhere.  Is this
assumption way wrong?

Indeed, if national governments were in the business of issuing

to cash.  However, I'm not sure if the mechanism of issuance can be
made the same as that of physical cash; is there a protocol that does
not require a two-way transaction to get the digicash?  (Physical cash

Indeed (poor Ms. Denning; I nominate her for Most Outstanding

what would you think about someone who, from their own property
nearby, could hear various interesting and suggestive noises that
happen to penetrate the walls of your bedroom and radiate out into the
atmosphere?  Are your rights violated simply because the person pays
attention to the stimulation of his eardrums?

While I wouldn't be at all fond of such a scenario, I find myself on a
slope if I claim that somewhere in there between completely
non-intrusive police and police as described above there's a
cross-over to a violation of my rights.  If, however, the police force
also declared that I must have large curtainless windows all over my
house, and I must not add insulation to walls to the point that
interior conversations could not be heard outside the house, then I
would say clearly that my right to affect my privacy by any means
available would be violated.

I guess I worry that such arguments may weaken (cheapen?) the concept

Clearly.  Thus, it's dangerous to work from the premise that definding
a natural right is the only reason to ask for government restraint.
I'd like to restrain the government simply because I'm definitely not

I believe this; my point was simply to clarify.  I interpreted Tim's

I think you might be able to do a lookup scheme more cheaply on CPUs
that really have such an extreme CPU/memory speed ratio.
You can encode the lookup table as an array of 4-bit values (you
*could* do 3-bits, but that'd make the table lookup a lot
messier). You can also add the trick of checking one bit of each byte
explicitly, and thus you could fit the entire table in 64 bytes.
That's probably just two-four cache lines, so access to the table
would become much less bad than 1/200th the register access time.
It'd be something like this:
Hmm...  That's probably about a dozen instructions per byte, or about
50 instructions for a 32-bit word.  The per-bit loops seem to be
around 100 instructions long.  If we've got a better than 12-1 speed
ration (CPU vs. memory), which is quite possible on a CPU with a
decent cache design, then I'd say the table lookup wins.

If eating cheesecake makes you happppy then the Constitution says you have
an inalienable right to it. This of course implies that  your expression of that right does not infringe on others.
All rights are natural rights. Your assumptio that governments arent natural
(for people) is cleary one based in unclear thinking. People are social animals
and their creation of governments is a natural expression of this. All rights
are natural.
Wrong, one has to be able to clearly define those rights prior to writing
them down. At least for me I have the thought and then write it down, not
the other way around. Wrong again, the right will happen when people decide to include it in the
Constitution, The document does not change under its own volition. The state can be changed under the constitution if enough people say they wanted it changed to cover a particular right. This is why the states
have the right to change the Constitution w/o Congressional approval. You
simply need to get the requisite number of states to agree to it.
As to freedom of the press, it was free until the English started trying
to regulate it. The people here felt that was an untold intrusion of any government into the actions of men.
Seems to me that a implicit assumption in  your argument is that the
actions of governments supercede the rights of man. I ask  you to explain
whey the Constitution goes to great expense to detail and explain the
rights of men and how they are decided (see Article  9, 10) and the fact
that the state is given NO rights at all...

My recollections from a brief stint with Intel in the early 80's is
that the company is quite conservative, and that Mr. Grove's personal
outlook is largely responsible.  Before I get torched, I hasten to
point out that "conservative" does not of course necessarily imply
"Clipper supporter"; there are certain statist philosophies that do so
imply, however, and some of those can be lumped into the category
I could be way wrong.  Perhaps Mr. May could add more.  It is
distressing (though not surprising) to know that there are individuals
in positions of power in cyberspace-related industries who hold
opinions antithetical to "ours".

This would be a little scary, though possible.  The problem could be
dealt with by ensuring that a phone always gives off an audible alarm
when it's contacted while on-hook.  Or, of course, you just turn the
phone off.

Well, you can't tell when you've been compromised, and you have no

real problem, however, is that you'll have a hard time convincing
anybody else to participate.

I picked up a new Mac this weekend (a Quadra 650, on the very eve of
its obsolescence :-) and with it came a CD from "Software Dispatch"
(or something like that) packed with commercial software, and
apparently locked with some sort of cryptographic protocol.
I'm not sure whether each CD is digitally stamped with a key (seems
kinda difficult) or whether the key I typed in from the cardboard
envelope at the start-up screen served the purpose of identifying my
disk (probably).  You call up an 800 number and give them a key from
the disk (I can't remember whether it was the same as the key I typed
in) and after supplying a credit card number they'll "unlock" whatever
packages you want by providing another key for each one.
Does anybody know what sort of protocol this is using?  The keys are
pretty long (about 16 bytes).  (Note that I'm really just curious; I
don't think I have the attention span to try and "break" it.  Besides,
I already bought the only things I wanted off it :-)

I've watched enough TV in my day to realize that if PGP had been
broken, they sure as heck wouldn't tell anybody about it.  The only
reason to make such an implication is to prevent people from using it.
Note that doubling the key size from 1024 to 2048 bits is also
probably a ruse, since it dramatically increases computation time (I
think).  1024 bits are a lot of bits as it is.

Not that I don't agree with the basic premise, of course, but there's
a similar risk to *any* consumer electronics implementation of a
cryptosystem.  Of course, in Clipper/Skipjack's case the problem is

However, a software-based consumer communicator will probably end up
implying at least as much weight in people's pockets, and as much
extra money, as Clipper.
I don't think an economic argument will really fly well, though I'd

True, of course, but looking at things as they are today a lot of my
tax dollars are long gone into the pockets of the contractors and NSA
people who did the design.  A commercial product not using Clipper is
at a disadvantage from the get-go.  Seems to me this is already true,
and short of exploiting the "investment gap" created in the Clipper
project by the inherent waste and inefficiency of Government-driven
projects, it'd be tough.  Certainly, there's a tremendous marketing
problem (which, I realize, our evangelism might help ameliorate).

Though I agree that the feather/pillow/stick/club scenario is
unrealistic, I disagree that it applies in this case.  The ITAR
regulations are being enforced around a situation that's essentially a
technological accident.
The difference between an exportable piece of software printed with
ink on a page and one in human-readable ASCII on a diskette is defined
solely by the state of technology.  If, tomorrow, some company began
selling a $99.95 scanner with built-in OCR translation software, then
there would really be no difference whatsoever.  To return to the
original analogy, it would put the "court" in a position of having to
declare an assault with an oaken bat illegal, but one with a hickory
bat OK.
There is a similar lack of distinction between source code and machine
code.  If I introduce a computer system whose primary interface
includes a C interpreter, then in some ways the source code *is*
machine code.

While we're being picky, I'll point out that (unless I'm wrong of

Uhh, isn't it the case that a Turing machine can simulate an NFA, but
not the reverse?  An NFA has no tape, and therefore is not as powerful
an automaton as a Turing machine.  Thus an NFA can be implemented by
an NTM, but not the reverse.
I think.

I agree that panic is uncalled for, but I don't agree that he will

similar position is certain to "do something"; this is an inevitable
result of the clash between traditional (since the 16th century,
anyway) views of copyright and what "we" think of the
meaning(lessness) of copyright in an online digital world.
Put yourself in his place.  Mr. Templeton's attitude makes perfect
sense.  The entire fabric of his business is based upon
state-supported protection of the "property" that's his stock in
trade.  I would think very little of him as a businessperson were he
to simple roll over and give up.
Indeed, it might actually be advantageous for the "something" to
happen sooner rather than later; clumsy attacks on freedom of
electronic communication could backfire, resulting in favorable (to
e-freedom) judgements that would stand as precedent later on.

How exactly are you going to transmit the synthesized caller ID
information from the subscriber equipment up the line to the local CO
when that local CO has no expectation whatsoever of seeing the

The caller ID information originates at the local CO, not at the

at which a connection is established, the local CO is not listening to
the subscriber line.  Caller ID information is delivered from the
remote CO to the called subscriber between the first and second ring

The imprecision in floating point is a factor only if you choose to

long to do what are essentially integer calculations.  indeed, there
have been CPUs (the CDC 6000 series come to mind) that have no integer

ANI and CID are different, by the way.

The only way I can imagine this working is if the ultimate receiver of
the caller ID information is badly designed, and the diverter in
question is strangely designed to exploit those bad designs.  Caller
ID comes through between the first and second ring pulses.  Any Caller
ID box or modem that decides to recognize the modulated CID
information after the second ring pulse is, IMHO, broken.
The only place for your dreamed-of device or the diverter you
described to put the CID information is directly through the completed
circuit after the called party answers.  If they have a truly
brain-damaged caller ID box that only stores one number, and they fail
to look at the box before they pick up the phone, then *maybe* they'd
be fooled.  Doesn't sound like much "security" to me.
Do you really have access to one of these call diverters?  If so,

Perhaps some improvement on RISC architectures could be achieved by
using four arrays, 32 bits wide by 256 entries long.  The arrays would
mirror the single array in the original code, except that the
"interesting" byte would be at a different position in each.  Then,
the main encryption loop could be unwound so that you'd do four
operations to each word, one from each array to hit the four bytes.  (You'd do the increment/swap between each one.)  This *might* be

it into the laser tubes.  That's one of the reason lasers require so
much power.
Curiously, the popular novelty product "Silly String" is in fact a scaled-down "domestic" version of real laser technology.

That reminds me:  I thumbed through BiBi's terrorism book (the one D.S.
certified as prerequisite reading for particpation in intelligent
discussions about something-or-other) at B&N the other day.  It's a
pretty thin book.  Most of it seems to be about the rise of the Moslem
Menace and how the Sultan's hordes will soon be upon us all.  The last
chapter outlines all the "necessary measures" governments must take
to stamp out the wildfire of terrorism.  Same old same old, mostly,
like allowing suspects to be held without charges, allowing warrantless
searches (I think), thorough weapon registration, and so on.  The last
one (or next-to-last; I think the last one is "brainwash the populace
into thinking this is all a good idea") is about establishing a periodic "civil liberties review panel".

Maybe I'm dense, but it didn't really "click" until the other day that
the Netscape mail reader, which renders html pages mailed as attachments
right there in the mail reader window, would also run any Java applets
(and, I guess, Javascript code) referenced by the page.
If you're using Netscape as a mail reader, and this isn't old news to
you, you can try it: point the browser at a page with an applet, and
then use the "File->Mail Document" menu command to mail it to yourself.
Thus:  if you want to gather some free compute cycles, just spam a
document out to a few thousand hapless victims.  Those using Netscape
for mail (and you can find them pretty easily by looking at the
"X-Mailer" field when creating your mailing list) will click on your
message, pull your applet, and give you some cycles without realizing
it.  Of course, your applet will be free to connect back to home base
and relay any results it gets.

Well, a lot of stuff "leaked out", but I'm not sure how much was actually
acknowledged to be true.  There was the thing about the "virus" in the
printer drivers, or something like that, but I seriously don't see how
any sort of software "attack" would have much significance once the Iraqi national microwave network was blasted into oblivion.
The point is that I don't personally believe that there's much of a
credible threat of one of these "Infowar Attacks" that this new commission plans to anticipate (by some means of divination; I am
really eager to see what that turns out to be).  Commercial systems
are disparate enough and so inherently flaky that I doubt some terrorist agency could do much worse than your run-of-the-mill catastrophic system failure.  The power grid is an exception, perhaps, but to attack that with any sort of real effect would probably require a
physical attack, and in any case even the grid seems capable of
random failures that bring about random chaos without the need for
creepy foreigners.
I also dispute the "lighthouse" story.  That setup only is meaningful when there's a service necessary to the well-being of the community in a situation where no mechanism for ready cash flow to a provider exists.  I question the premise that commercial suppliers of security systems &
consulting can't solve corporate security problems effectively.  Indeed, a good argument could be made that we're better defended by a wide variety of different security systems, rather than a single General Issue Uncle Sam Security System.

I can only assume that anybody who reaches adulthood without incidentally
learning how to make a bomb, or who at least becomes acquainted with
someone else who they can confidently assume knows how to help out in
a pinch, is merely an idiot.  It appears that Ms. Feinstein herself has
no idea how to make a bomb, and that therefore she assumes it's a monstrous
cabal of psychotic murderers that passes this sort of information around via illicit texts and, lately, the despicable Internet.
Who's never read a spy novel or muder mystery with (possibly bogus, though
at least vaguely accurate) bomb-building hints?  Who's grown up with
violent American television and film without absorbing at least a shred
of information regarding bombs?   Is it really possible that a marginally
intelligent person could find themselves needing to build a bomb but
have no idea how to proceed?
Either that, or Ms. Feinstein assumes (depressingly, perhaps correctly) that her constituency is itself so collectively idiotic that they'll accept such activity as good work done for their benefit.
I doubt the latter.  Ms. Feinstein has never in public speech given me
intuitive feelings that she's at all a devious, subtly manipulative person.
I think she's an honest idiot who turns the fortune of her political power
to causes she believes to be right.  It's infuriating.
So infuriating, in fact, that I'll vent a bit more.  How effective does
Ms. Feinstein imagine a ban on bomb-building information might be?  Those
who've already learned can't be expected to forget, so there'll be a period of time during which today's crop of crazed bombers work the
urges out of their systems.  There'll be the determined traffic in illegal dog-eared volumes traded secretly among those awful militia members in all the "scary" states between Lake Tahoe and the Potomac.
Given the rarity of bombings today, can anyone honestly expect that even
the most draconian crack-down on information will turn back the clock to the days before virtually every adolescent male knew the raw ingredients of gunpowder?

@_subject: Java Crypto API questions 
How can you do this currently?  (With applets in browsers, I mean.)
Well, it's not perfect, but I hold out the hope that real support for some
capability assignments can be provided by the time a serious infrastructure
of certificate authorities of some sort can develop.
Note also that this is not only a Sun issue; Netscape has to support it
all too.  Currently, note that the HotJava browser already allows some
configuration to the Security Manager that Netscape doesn't.
Huh?  They're explicitly saying that they won't make any attempt to prevent
signed applets from doing anything they want to do, if you tell the thing
that you trust a particular certificate.  Thus, you are now able to grant
complete trust to an applet with a given certificate.  You can't readily
do that now.
This means that if you trust the certificate system itself, then allowing
an applet from Borland or Microsoft or IBM to do whatever it wants to your
machine is about the same risk as allowing a program on CD-ROM from Borland
or Microsoft or IBM to do whatever it wants to your machine.
I think you need to explain this; it seems to have nothing to do with
the issue at hand.
Based on the state of the Borland Java stuff I've seen, I wouldn't have very high expectations in the Delphi department.
And for some applications (webish ones included or not) that's actually
a very good reason.  Business is business.

Anything's debatable, but silliness it remains.  The entire (also
silly, but tediously common) "but there's a real victim involved"
argument goes out the window.  And where's the line drawn?  Like

That reminds me.  As someone who hasn't yet given up on WiReD in disgust
(instead, I get it and read it faithfully in disgust), I was particularly
pissed-off at the latest "Kids Net Rights" issue.  Jonathan Katz
huffs and puffs about how "nobody in the digital world" protests the
idea of rating schemes to keep non-adults away from information, and indeed claims that "the digerati" (grrr) are pushing rating schemes with
great gusto to save themselves from censorship.
I guess by "nobody", he probably means "nobody who hangs out in the same
trendy espresso bars as the WiReD trendmeisters".  I've seen plenty of
invective directed at the concept of rating systems in general, from
a variety of people including Tim May and li'l ol' me.  That's been here
and on some various newsgroups.

I'd like to claim this for potential use in a .signature, if nobody
else has thusly used it already.
By the way, there was a thing in the Yahoo/Reuters feed about "attacks"
on DoD computers; apparently British police arrested a "hacker" the
other day.  Anyway, the article included a claim that there have been
250,000 attempted break-ins on DoD computers over the past year.
Does anybody know how they count that?

If you don't encrypt or otherwise secure sensitive surface mail the same way you would e-mail, you deserve what you get.  The community, of course,
is in the same state with secure snail-mail case as it is with PGP-encrypted
Which reminds me of something I've been meaning to ask about.  I read
(probably in WiReD) about a bar-code-like (well, not *much* like, but
ink-on-paper similar) technique for rendering data onto paper with
enhanced properties of storage efficiency, resistance to degradation
through photocopying, and ease of recovery via ordinary scanning.  The
stuff looks like bunches of little lines at different angles, I think.
Anyway, what I'm curious about is whether encode/decode (i.e., print
and scan) software is available.

I don't think this comparison is valid at all.
What if I just *see* your couch, and then back in my garage I use my
couch replicator to make a couch just like yours, complete with fuzzballs
and loose change between the cushions?  Now I have your couch, in a sense.
Are you still upset?
When I walked off with your blood chemistry data, did you lose the use
of it for your future purposes?
And try this:  I now am in posession of some information about you, * You subscribe to cypherpunks and are aware of (and possibly a sympathizer
towards) a variety of wacko political ideas;
* You believe in "strong" ownership rights over information (something handy if I'm on some legislative warpath and need supporters)
What do you propose as to the obligations I should have to you as regards
the disposition of this information?  For example, what if I receive a phone call from somebody interested in any e-mail addresses of people I
know who might be interested in supporting the new on-line copyright bill?
I just might decide to sell him your address.
