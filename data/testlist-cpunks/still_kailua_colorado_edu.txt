@_subject: On The Inherent Evil of Electronic Democracy 
I don't think public opinion is 'molded' so much, just that it's fancies are
entertained too much.  (Info-tained?)  I dropped by a local bookstore last
night to hear Jim Lehrer (McNeil/Lehrer Newhour on PBS) speak about his new
book.  He brought up this topic, saying that "mainstream news," (never
mind the dribble of Donahue or Oprah) has been remiss in *reporting
the news* for years, instead sensationalizing news and entertaining the According to Lehrer, T.V. news (and newspapers who must now compete
with them) have stopped asking their reporters to "get the facts" instead
encouraging them to "get the dirt," or else.  Look what has happened:
the three major networks have lost over 30% market-share to other outlets
like NPR and PBS or from people that just plain turn it off.  Extreme
voter apathy.  Twentynothings from hell :-)
The good side to this according to Lehrer is that one day soon a bunch
of balding men will sit around the NBC board-room table and say, "We
need more viewers, what do we do?"  One particularly bright young man
will finally say, "I know, let's report the news!," and everyone will bust
out in applause.  Lehrer's been doing it for 18 years.  The info-tainment
stuff is a small blip on the Neilson charts and nothing more.  Maybe I'm a too optimistic for my own good though  :^)   - Jim

@_subject: Source Code NOT available for ViaCrypt PGP 
Are there any volunteers among the Windows guru/programmer's here to
kick out a shell that supports PGP?  2.3a is *much* more stable than
2.2 (and runs great from within PGPShell .PIF'd from Windows.)
IMHO only a fraction of Carl's newcomers will even take a second look
at PGP unless there's an interface for it.  Our privacy shtick falls
short on the masses that don't understand our zealotry or the need to
protect their own privacy.  They want it to be *fun* and could care
less about the conspiracies involved.
First you get the teeming millions to enjoy what they're doing (see?
encryption is fun kids!) and more importantly, feel very comfortable
using encryption tools.  That way if the fateful day of encryption bans
does come, these tools will be as hard to take away from them as from a
Texan who first learns to shoot his father's gun.

@_subject: Will Mike Ingle's name be a household word like "Buttafuoco"? 
Mike Ingle comments on his recently released "Secure
Drive" program:
In case someone isn't familiar with Mike's excellent program,
it does for hard drives, what PGP does for messages.  With
Secure Drive (ver 1.0) you can set up a partition on your hard
drive encrypt it (SecDrv uses the IDEA cipher for data and RSA
for your pass phrase just like PGP) and access the encrypted
drive from a TSR in your C drive.
In my opinion, this is the best example yet since PGP of
"cypherpunks writing code" because of the implications that
this program has on privacy.  (I'm using it to keep a personal
space for my tax records, private correspondence, PGP dir, etc.),
but Mike's suggestion for encrypting an entire BBS itself
is a good point.  What if *every* sysop encrypted their BBS
with Secure Drive?
His program is DOS freeware and available on the Hieroglyphic
Voodoo Machine BBS at +1.303.443.2457 (V.32bis) as SECDRV10.ZIP.
It is also available on soda.berkeley.edu I'm sure although I
haven't looked there myself.
This e-mail is also a shameless tag line promo!

Could anyone who has purchased ViaCrypt PGP answer my question?
What is the executable filename?  Is it still PGP.EXE or did they throw
their own little proprietary in there with a VIAPGP.EXE or some such?
I appreciate your response!  (I'm about to put out another version of
a shell program and thought about extending support to ViaCrypt's

@_subject: PGP and offline-readers 
I'm beta testing a privacy-oriented BBS right now that I just finished
programming, called CryptoBBS and what better place to
introduce/ask questions on it than among the cypherpunks!
It is geared towards the hobbyist sysop with an old XT clone or
something lying around as it is a mere 80K (for the floppy-sysops!)
There is no logon prompt asking for name, birthdate, SSAN, and
who knows what else, it goes directly onto the board.  Callers
wishing to post messages, are asked for an alias name to
fill in the FROM: block, but real names or call-back verifiers
are not supported.  My hope is to offer sysop's a choice,
between *choosing* to preserve privacy, rather than the
current practice of obtaining personal information because
the questionnaire's are preprogrammed that way.
The unique feature about CryptoBBS is it's "Post Office."  The
P.O. allows callers to set up a p.o. box from which they can
up/download any file (pgp encrypted files for instance) to any
other user on the board without the sysop's approval/knowledge.
It encourages and nurtures an anonymous "mail drop" community
while protecting the caller's privacy.
The question is, should I throw away the virtues of a lean 'n mean
app at 80K by adding a dolphin or pgp to it that automatically
encrypts the message base, uploaded messages, etc?  Should
we give the BBS caller a little credit and assume he knows to
encrypt at his own machine before uploading the text?  Or is
the temptation to make everyone *lick and seal their message
envelopes* too invasive?
I know the issue of encouraging pgp use by making it as
painless as possible on the end-user is nothing new around
here, but as far as I know no one has ever discussed whether
or not BBS's should handle the job for the caller.

@_subject: Large Scale Implementation of PGP 
Bravo!  Widespread use of PGP now is analogous to Ben Franklin's pre-
revolutionary attempts at setting up and popularizing a post office.  People
are interested, but aren't ready to take the initiative and accept "new"
If I might put in a selfish plug, get ahold of PGPSHEL2.ZIP at the
soda.berkeley.edu site and give it to co-workers and "Windows types"
(you all know who those newcomers are :-)  ) who are vaguely interested
in secure communications.  I've discovered that non-DOS folks will let
PGP sit on their hard drives for months without exploring it, but once they
use PGPShell, begin taking an active interest in what PGP is and does.
With all the discussion about what the difference is between Usenet and
BBS's, this is probably an important difference as well.  BBS users are
still enamored with the *concept* of public key encryption, while the more
experienced Usenet users take it for granted.  They know there's something
going on "up there" but aren't too sure what all this PGP talk is all about.
The BBS users are an excellent place to "spread the word" about
encryption and shouldn't be ignored.  With their help encryption will be
as normal and every day as the post office is today.

@_subject: Nazis/Privacy/Cypherpunks 
If I understand your basic point to be:  "consider the worst
possible scenario in order to better prepare for it" then I
agree completely.  However I have serious reservations with
emulating or (gadzooks!) *admiring* those Nazi tactics that
seemed to "work" because I would disagree that, first they
actually did work, and more importantly, that their ends
justified the means.  Which brings me to your second point:
I disagree.  (Semantics check:  I'm not talking about a mouse driver
or a basic windowing interface here.  Obviously, there's no need to
hammer out that wheel again.)
I am talking about what I see as a basic cypherpunk mission, that
being, "the constant reevaluation of the approach towards privacy."
We have the ability to constantly rip apart our own ideas, like
children's ABC blocks, and see if they fit back together again
in a better way.  I would prefer to see constant rewrite's of a
"given" (like PGP for instance) than to stagnate and rely on the
one idea, concept, or proof just because we've always done it
that way.  Our code should be like our ethics: constantly re-
evaluated, questioned, and tested for validity.

Douglas Barnes digs up:

I find it very ironic that a list dedicated to the preservation of personal

posting something to the effect of:  "There's a lot to learn from the Nazi
methods of rooting out Communists...."  Disturbing coincidence or Illumanati
plot?  Perhaps.  Then again, maybe its just a mob mentality to storm the
castle and burn the Frankenstein monster.
No thanks, keep the torch (you'll need it, those castle's get very dark at
night).  Its none of my business whether or not L. Det wants to post
"quasi-religious" rants or even if he wants to leech off of alt.erotica

@_subject: PGP removal 
Several months ago I uploaded a program I wrote called PGPShell (which is
a DOS front-end for PGP) to Compu$erve's IBMSYS forum.  For most people in
Russia who do not have FTP access or reliable links to the West, CS is their
only way of obtaining PGP or related utilities.
Even though it performs no encryption on its own, PGPShell was soon deleted
from the IBMSYS forum.  I assumed it a mistake, and uploaded it a second Same thing.  It has been three times now, and I'm certain that it has been
deleted again; my only hope is that during those brief periods when it was
there, my new-found friends in Russia had a chance to snatch it.
Ironically, while Yeltsin dissolves free speech and authoritarianism returns to Russia, Compu$erve has been further trivializing its already politically-correct venture.

@_subject: ID of anonymous posters via word analysis? 
This practice is, IMHO, extremely unethical and dubious at best!
If the world's experiences are a metaphorical "object" bundled up in
a <.lib> somewhere in the cosmos, then *anything* that the Nazi's
did should be considered completely bugged code.  Why do we want to
inherit their flawed algorithm's?
The whole point of the cypherpunk cause is to compile code from the
ground up--considering the ethics involved with decisions such as
rooting out 'nyms.  Have we decided that it is now imperative to know
the identities of those on 'our' side (further fueling this
polarization of 'us' versus 'them')?
Let's leave behind this obsession with determining who's who; it
has taken us too close to the kluged code of Nazi history!  My eye
is on the prize...  ;)

Local boy makes good at home.  The Federal Grand Jury's PGP/RSA test
case, as reported in the NYT has hit full circle here in Boulder.
Boulder's own Paul Danish (former editor and writer for Soldier of
Fortune magazine, based in Boulder) has come out in support of PGP/privacy
issues with an excellent op-ed piece in today's Colorado Daily.
The Colorado Daily is read by over 50,000 students, fac/staff and
residents of Boulder and the Univ. of Colorado.  Danish's piece
does an amazing job of backgrounding the issues, presenting them
in layman's terms, and he even goes into the Clipper chip proposal.
Could it be that the NSA/U.S. Customs investigation is causing a
huge backlash of public support in favor of PGP?
