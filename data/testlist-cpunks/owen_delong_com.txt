@_subject: Verizon FiOS - is BGP an option? 
48vDC battery to power your phone up to 3 ringer equivalences was a pretty
light load overall, compared to PON aggregators for all those neighborhoods.
Further, as noted above the PON equipment is much more widely distributed
than powering your phone. Powering your phone was straight DC down the
same copper wire as your service. Powering the PON aggregators, well,
unless you've got some magic new technology for powering them via fiber
is a bit more involved and quite a bit more amperage per conductor than
That's a lot of generators and a lot of people to go pull them out and make
sure they don't walk off during said extended outage.
Seems pretty reasonable to me given the scale of the outage.
20 years ago you didn't have a megabit to your home let alone many
megabits. 20 years ago, POTS was much simpler than the converged
networks we have today. There is something to be said for the simplicity
of POTS.
If you're that concerned about calling 911 for a heat stroke, why don't
you maintain a POTS line?
