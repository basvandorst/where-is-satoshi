Dear David and Neal:
    David, you continue to amaze me in a positive manner. For
cotemporaneous, spontaneous writing that is not polished by a guy who is
busy, you excel at manifesting the King's English, being a diplomat and
expressing a clear appreciation for complex subtelties.
    I find the exchange between you and Neal to be most interesting reading.
If the Gun Prohibitionists were to read your exchange they would have to
conclude that each of you are most thoughtful citizens who certainly appear
to be worthy of unregistered firearms.
    There is great truth in both of your viewpoints.
    There is no point in taking the time to split hairs in minutia.
    Please, I urge you, include me in all future such exchanges on any
topic. I love being exposed to fine minds at work.
    --Peter Mancus
