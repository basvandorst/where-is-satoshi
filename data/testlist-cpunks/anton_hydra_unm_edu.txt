@_subject: FAQ: PGP where? 
For those with modems but not full Internet access, you can obtain PGP2.2
from the BBS listed in the .sib below.  Full access first call.
I stock the DOS, Mac, and Unix versions, the source code/utils package (in
.ZIP format), and the DOS menu/shell program.  Look in the LOGIN and NON-
IBM file areas.  All are direct from wel established FTP sites (garbo, oak, etc.), NOT from uploads or from other BBSs.  Clean as whistle!  If you wish
anonymity, you can get the DOS ver, source and shell from the LOGIN file
area, if you login as GUEST password GUEST.  Don't futz about though, the
GUEST acct. is quite time-restricted.  Best bet is login normally.
If you never plan to call again, just enter x and 0000 for all the question-
naire fields, and leave a "delete me" omment to sysop, if you would.

RE: becoming suits.  No.  Cypherpunks is a unique group, don't cheapen it.
Get the suits sympathetic to you (and among you) to do the suit thing.
RE: change the name.  Why?  It is not as if cypherpunks is a cable network.
It is a mailing list.  Most people will never know it exists.  If you send
out missives for the masses, just sign them with you name, and don't put "cypherpunks" on it, if you fear it will be misinterpreted.  I know how it
feels.  My BBS sounds like a hackers' den, but it is a clean, legal online
library, and has not that much in common with the typical BBS.  Sometimes
I think of changing the name and then I think, "No, no Noise in the Void was
the name, is the name, will be the name."
If people want a Nat'l. Cryptography Assoc., let them go make one.  Re: why I joined, and if it has anything to do with the name. I signed on the list, because I needed info on crypto, and sci.crypt is in-
convenient (I hardly use UseNet anymore, it becomes more worthless by the second it seems.)  However I did grin punkishly at the name.  I like it.
If the list had been Nat'l. Crypto. Assoc., I would likely have avoided it,
simple because it sounds suit, and I have no patience with suits, and do not trust them.

This is not an ad, but a public service announcement. NitV-BBS is FREE.
This info (and my system!) has been updated to make it easier for you to
obtain Pretty Good Privacy (PGP): Secure RSA pubkey encrytion for all!
Due to the overwhelming response, I have sought out as many ports as
possible.  After a week of exhaustive FPT/Archie searches it appears to
me that NitV-BBS is the world's singlemost comprehensive PGP site, with
executables and/or source code for the following platforms:
        Platform               exec     source     patch     extras
    MS-DOS (PC-DOS, etc.)       X         X                    X
    Macintosh                   X         X

Reminds me, I think we (meaning libertarianistically minded sysops and
users) should organize another con, to compete with ONE BBSCON.  ONE
BBSCON (Online Networking Exposition & BBS Convention) will apparently
be held in the same place every year, costs $325 just to get in the
door, and it 100% controlled by the corporate interests that are
screwing up the BBS scene.  We need a new con that is run by, and
caters to, the hobbyist and shareware BBS scene.  Still lots of room
for vendors, but for the non- and semi-commercial software authors, who
are left behind by ONE BBSCON's outrageous prices for display booth

You know, the first thing that comes to mind when I hear all these slams
against the idea of electronic democracy is that the tone and content of
the objections are all but identical to those opposing any new tech, most
notably the prospect of nanotechnology.  I mean, give me a break.  Of course the idea is dangerous.  But movement
at least somewhat in that direction is totally inevitable.  Only by
recognizing that it, or something like it, will occur, and planning for
it, will head off the possible abuses.  I personally think it highly
unlikely that the whole govt would just roll over and die, but in time
people will outright DEMAND more control over the govt.  It IS coming
whether any of you like it or not.  If you doubt this, ask yourself why
FOIA appeared.  The govt certainly didn't come up with that idea.  Nor did
they come up with and promote the idea of govt. info available via
computer and networking tech to the general populace.  Nor FIJA.

@_subject: DigiCoupons & DigiCash 
* Digital coupons: S&H greenstamps for online services (netcom/Well/Compuserve net connection services, AMIX, NEXIS/LEXIS, Dow Jones, commercial MUDs, metered e-mail, anon services, network and computing resources, reputation ratings, etc.)  Greenstamps are like frequent-flyer miles, you accumulate
them with heavy patronage of some service.  But greenstamps
can be used to purchase a wide variety of services, not just more of the same service.  Service providers and coupon vendor(s) work out arrangements for awarding and honoring
greenstamps.  Implemented with Chaum-style protocol to prevent
forgery and assure privacy.
* Digital cash: accumulating credits/debits for use of on-line
services (including travel services, concert tickets, etc. purchased on-line), eventually paid for by some "real" currency: FRNs, yen, etc.  Implemented with Chaum-style protocol to prevent
forgery and assure privacy.
* On-line markets: Internet video poker, election outcome
markets, satellite track betting, etc.  Investments[1] can be made & paid out by greenstamps, natch.  On-line advertising.
Count me in.  You code-grinders come up with some way to do this stuff,
and I'll be happy to implement what of it I can on NitV-BBS.  Coupons [the
term greenstamps is probably trademarked] could work: those of you that
wish to make use of the BBS could upload (as a file or directly into the
message base) these coupons and get time/download credit on the board for
them, provided I have some way to spend them for something useful to me. Eventually if I can get IndraNetters into the idea, this could expand into
a user-to-user thing too, perhaps even in online door games (for those not
hip to BBS jargon, doors are programs run from the BBS, such as games,
doors, credit-card ordering applications for commercial stuff, etc etc.)
I can picture a high-stakes version of Barren Realms Elite, where the
"credits" in the game are real DigiCoupons that can be spent on other
boards, or at various Internetted sites, etc etc.  I don't actually see much use in separating DigiCash and DigiCoupons. They both would appear to me to be almost identical in form and funtion. Whoever works on this sort of thing will hopefully work with Chaum to
ensure that our DigiCash is "compatible" as it were.  No sense getting
such a system going only to have it eclipsed later, and all our DigiCash
become worthless.
* Securely private BBS's
I'll pass on that one for now, my board's multi-user, open, and networked;
going the crypto route would reduce my user base to about 3 people,
including me!
Anyway, those of you not aware of it, NitV-BBS is still stocking a certain
fave crypto program of ours, legal threats be damned.
I'd also encrouge any of you running BBSs or participating in them to
contact mine and get in on IndraNet.  Just due to a few Extropians and
Cypherpunks doing this, the net has grown quite a bit, and is taking on a
decidedly libertarian flavour, with many spirited debates.  Sadly the
CRYPTO conference is very slow, so we need more participants.  More info
on the net:
IndraNet was founded by me, and oddly enough, a staunch republican that
enjoyed arguing with me.  I guess we just wanted our own entire net to
argue in.  He dropped out of it due to some personal things to deal with,
leaving a net of one.  SO, I promoted it, and within just a few month it
was not only national but international, now with nodes in 4 countries and
about 6 or so states.  There are over 30 conferences [UseNetters will
chuckle, but for a BBS-based OtherNet this is not bad; most BBSs don't
have more than 30 conferences total, many much less; there's just not
enough traffic on most boards to support that much chatter.]  Possibly
uniquely among BBS networks, there are:
NO POLICY DOCS (rules)
NO MODERATORS or COORDINATORS (dictators)
NO CENSORSHIP
It's a working, growing anarchy.  There have been some problems, namely
nodes that are "family" BBSs getting upset at the occasional swearing, but
oh well, not much to be done for it.  But all in all it appears to be working.
Currently we support QWK and Fido-tech mail formats, though those who are
also using some other format, such as MegaMail, PostLink, or PCRelay are
encouraged to make IndraNet available via those formats as well.  Some
time in the not-too-distant-future, I hope to get NitV hooked up to
Internet/UseNet via UUCP, and make IndraNet conferences available as
Internet mailing lists and "virtual local newgroups" (i.e. set up just
like local groups, but actually available to any node intending to
participate, but certainly not as a public alt.whatever series of
newsgroups; you know what I mean.)
To get into this, and to get more info, contact me by any means suggested
in the .sig below.
PS NOTE: I am not currently receiving the list, just for the time being

My 2 bits worth, before the deal is done:  I'd much rather have a T-shirt.
In fact I would not buy a polo shirt.  I don't play polo, and see no
reason to dress like a yuppie/preppie.  Some may like them, so here's my idea:
Make a silkscreen and put in on poloshirts, caps, Ts, and tanktops (in the
middle, sort of like those german army tanktops.)  Maybe even on a jersey
or sweatshirt.  Then everyone is happy.  My question would be, who gets the money, and who does the work?  Is this
something some individual is going to go do, or is some sort of CP fund
going to be set up (which could perhaps be used to help get a conference
or something going, or at least cover the cost of some duly elected
representative of the CPs to attend important conferences and report back
to us all.  Or something like that.

@_subject: Term software development/design 
All of these ideas (on new term programs for grabbing news, and for
getting PGP sigs from scrollback, etc etc) are all very interesting and
worthy of more work.  However, I think the BEST way to do this, is to
convince Mustang Software (or whoever) to add hooks for PGP or other
encryption packages, and then the rest should soon follow. Most users
WILL NOT quit using QModem (or whatever) for a new term program that has
nothing special but crypto.  BUT if you can get crypto into the popular
packages, then lots of users WILL use it since well it's THERE, and easy
to get to and they don't have to switch software. As for the creation of new term programs, I'd have to say making it RELY
on a FOSSIL driver is a BAD idea.  FOSSILs are becoming less useful and
needed over time.  Almost NO new door software uses FOSSILs, because
companies like Compaq are making more-compatible machines with less
proprietary garbage in them.  FOSSIL support that is OPTIONAL would be
very nice, for those using old or wierd machines that can't handle
standard comm routines, but forcing FOSSIL (or anything else) on anyone
is a bad idea in my opinion. Also, those into Fido-tech netting should try to get the developers of
FrontDoor, InterMail, D'Bridge, Opus, Maximus, VBBS, BinkleyTerm, etc to
add support for the ^ENC klugeline (an addition to the FTSC-standard Fido
mail headers, that notifies mailer software that the message is

SecureMail system is going to remain minor and ignored.  With it,
cryptomail could fast become the norm in Fido NetMail.  For this corner or
cyberspace direct support for this sort of thing could be the "make or
break" for whether crypto becomes accepted.
Just some thoughts.

I agree wholeheartedly that a commandline, portable, version should come
first. Porting that separately to X, Win, Mac, etc will not be nearly the
chore that porting a Windows app to Unix will be.  Re: the ubiquity of Windows:
LOTS of people have Windows. But...
The idea that new machine sales are mostly Windows machines is given the
lie somewhat by the fact that they are also all DOS machines, and that
Windows is just bundled.  Many people don't install it due to the disk
space leeching.  And a LOT of people with Windows don't use it for comm
stuff because Windows + comm = nightmare.
So yes, make a Windows version.  NO don't start with a windows version.
One of your biggest markets will be the BBS crowd, 90+% of whom use DOS,
not Windows, for comm apps. And I still heartily recommend tackling this from several different
angles. Sure make a new term, but also get Telix, et all to go along with
it.  Get Fido-tech mailer makers to support the ^ENC "standard", etc. --         When marriage is outlawed only outlaws will be inlaws!

As for "is kermit good enough?"  No.  Almost NO ONE in the DOS world uses
it any more, it is a total anachronism.  Of all the 400 or so users on my
board, many from other parts of the country, even other countries, not
ONE uses kermit (I have "What comm program do you use?" as one of the
initial login questions).  The only practical use of Kermit is for
computer newbies to use it to access the dialup lines at their school
(UNM gives out free copies of it), but most such people soon switch to
another program. Thing is Kermit is just plain old, and a pain in the butt.  When I
started BBSing, the Kermit protocol was supported on most BBSs; today I
cannot think of a single BBS around here that has it anymore (I'm the
defacto city BBSlist maker, so I'd know :)
Perhaps this area is atypical, and Kermit is all the rage elsewhere, but
considering how BEHIND the times Albuquerque is, I tend to doubt it.
Freeware and shareware comm programs available from any BBS or FTP site
will DUST Kermit, and I think it's a dead end.  All I can say, is any
crypto package based on a hack of Kermit will go nowhere.  I know it's
free and readily available, but well so's a kick in the ass.  >;)

I am NOT interested in arguing the merits or lack thereof of Kermit. Kermit IS used, but rarely on PCs, and VERY rarely in what appears to be
the target market.  Remember that we're talking about a general-user,
friendly application for the compuklutz.  After being spoiled by QModem,
there is no way in hell, heaven or otherwise that many of them will use
Kermit or something based on it, unless it offers all that QM does (incl.
Zmodem, external protocols, cute menuing interface, etc.)  I think
there's a confusion here, namely that Kermit is useful on some sorts of
machines, and for specific purposes, but this idea is getting mixed up
with what is the most useful DOS comm program(s), the one(s) most used. THATs where the market is.  Its not a matter of "is kermit cool, is
kermit good enough, is kermit free?", its a matter of "will the target
users actually use it, or anything based on it?"  I'd suggest again that
the answer is "no".  That's all.  Not meaning to insult anyone who's fave
term prog. is kermit.  Just trying to suggest a clarified view of the PC
telecom program market.  People make new comm programs all the time, many
with a LOT of features.  But they ain't the Big Three, so they get
ignored.  Perhaps sadly.

RELAX, fnerd!
I almost sent you my new "Dear flamer" form letter, but I guess this
deserves an answer.  Please don't yell at me like this.
My cautious conclusion from this and other discussions with Jim directly
(at least I presume it is he; as I said before I get suspicious when the
head of the worlds largest cryptography corp. does not use his own
signatory authentication software), is that 1) RSADSI/PKP cares only for its bottom line.  People like Jim Bidzos may
care about stopping Clipper, but that is largely irrelevant in a corp.
It's like your brain deciding it doesn't want food.  Your body will go on
craving food if you like it or not. 2) DSI is more-or-less anti-clipper, because it will hurt their biz in the
long term.  It is, being a typical corp., driven more by immediate profit
motive; thus it calls bullshit on the Gov't violating their "patent", and
thus accepting the deal when the govt "capitulates".  In typical
corporate double think, it does not see the blindinly obvious conflict of
interests here.  The weasel factor is likely the rationalization that key
escrow does not equal clipper, which is true, though as we all know, they
two are intertwined like snakes in a basket. 3) there is no conspiracy of PKP/RSA with NIST/NSA.  It's just a product
of commercial short-sightedness and even outright stupidity and illogic. 4) regardless of this, this move on the part of RSA is likely to be
detrimental to the cause, and is dangerous.
As for your other points:
A) I am "sniffing" and I said this is a "cautious" conclusion, because all
the evidence is not in.  B) sniping is USEFUL.  Ask any revolutionary.  This is not a pitched
battle, it is a guerilla war, a propaganda war, & a political cold war.
C) it makes plenty of sense.  My intent was to present the facts and
material I find (for which I actually expected some thanks, imagine that!
Who else among you bothered to make the effort to contact Big Jim
personally and get their side of the story?), and to encourage people to
think about it and weigh the data and "draw your own conclusions".  I do
not Know All in this matter, and did not wish to try to force my view on
the whole.  Furthermore, I think you are upset with the messenger, rather
than concentrating on the message.  All I am doing is saying, "Here I got
this.  It made me think.  Look at it and think about it too."
D) Yes there's a war on.  But I am not Rambo, I'm the USAF journalist who
doesn't feel like getting shot thank you very much ;)

Sorry to get on your case yet again, Perry, but I just cannot accept that,

@_subject: PGP, and TANSTAAFL! 
Hmm not sure if that is a good thing or not No, no that is not quite what I am meaning.  What I mean by " should be free" is that we should be presumed to have that right,
and that it should not be abridged in any way whatsoever, especially not
for a fee.  As an example, we have a right to bear arms.  You should not have to pay a fee for that right.  You certainly *should* have to pay for
the arms you bear, or make your own.  I think YOU are slightly confusing the
issue.  Rights are not property, but are concepts.  I argue that what one
should pay for are items of property, as well as services, whether they are
tools for excercising a right or not.  You don't get things for free. But
rights are not really "things" in that sense at all.  Imagine if you had to buy an annual Free Speech Registration from the FCC.  Without this registra-
tion certificate, you may only use words in The Official FCC Dictionary, and
may only construct phrases that follow the rules of The Official FCC Style
Guide, and may only talk about subjects delimited in The Official FCC Subject
Index; any violation of these policies will result in punishment not to exceed $10,000 and/or 10 years in prison.  This may seem an absurd example,
but one most of us are familiar with if we have read _1984_.  And no, no one can walk up and hand you a box full of privacy.  Rights are
there or not there, conceptually speaking.  I don't think that not defending
a right makes the right moot, per se, though you may lose it.  Thing is you
should not have to defend it.  Any attempt to extinguish a right is by def-
inition a violation of it.  Unfortunately, people are only too happy to violate other's rights, so we have to defend them.
No, the "right" is in your right to actually leave work, and go get something
to eat.  If you employer demanded a $15 dock in pay to take lunch, or refused
to let you have your break (and in most states I believe there are labor laws
that mandate that employees get a certain length-of-time break for every x
amount of work) that would be a violation of your right to have lunch.  Like-
wise if someone put a gun to your head and said "thou shalt eat no lunch".
*I* don't think so, personally.
How so?
Nope.  I don't think privacy (or any other right) is a commodity. I see the
2 categories as mutually exclusive.  When a "right" becomes a commodity,
it is no longer a right, but a privilege.
Sure I can.  All of us here, or many of us, are fighting for at least one
of our rights, namely privacy.  I have yet to see someone say that we should
BUY our right, or that we are fighting to be allowed to purchase or get a license for that right.  Rather we are fighting because some people in the
govt with big egos or someother mental problem are trying to destroy that
right, to nullify it.  FIGHTING for the right may not be free, since again
one must purchase tools to do that with, and also "services" (if you can call
legal and court fees a service >:).  But the right itself has no price tag.
Nope not at all.  Few things offend me, and debate is one of the last things
I'd be offended by.
I think they would indeed, and the cypherfolk also.  I can think of few groups
more concerned with our rights and protecting them.
Thanks for the comments, this is a good thing to talk about, to hash out.

@_subject: BBSs under fire! (or on fire, if BATF gets into the act!) 
I'd like to invite discussion, either private or listwise, on: Why is the govt.
targetting BBSs?
I note Eric S. Raymond accuses the govt and its mouthpieces of using the largely
manufactured horror of 'kiddie porn' as a "fait acompli", to yank the rug from
under our feet when we take exception to the idea that the U.S. Govt. should
have the authority to inspect our private lives and operations. Not to mention
also using the treat of 'terrorism' and 'dangers to national security' et al.
ad nauseum.
I'd like to tell you a short anecdote:
I frequently grep the entire disk system here for accessible .GIF files.
I need them for my BBS, and even though this grepping about hogs CPU time,
it is certainly less bandwidth costly than firing up a full FTP session to go hunting for such "warez".  Inevitably, many of these graphics files are
'porno'.  Also inevitably a few are 'illegal' porno, such as that featuring
beastiality and or nude children.  Most of these appear to originate from the
orient and from Europe.  I have no use for such materials, but apparently someone does. I did an experiment.  Noting the filenames, I looked about in
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica, and did an xarchie search, and many of these
files are available from US educational institutions, via both FTP archives
(usually in the uploads area -- I am confident that the maintainers of such
sites ditch this stuff in a jiffy.  There are exceptions, however) and the UseNet system.
Now, maybe I missed something, but I have yet to see the secret service raid
ftparchive.blah.edu, or UNM where I work, for 'pandering'.  Yet BBSs get
raided for SUSPICION of having such material, and get their equipment con-
fiscated.  I am pissed off enough that I am having a hard time even formulating
my displeasure into a logical post, but here goes anyway:
1) who gave the govt the right to distribute this material, and deny others
to do so (for whatever reason) - these universities ARE part of the govt.
2) why is the govt scapegoating BBSs?  Are we THAT 'dangerous and subversive'?
3) why is it that people in general cannot see this BS for the BS it is?
Is it REALLY so hard to see that "terrorism" and "kiddie porn" are not real
threats, but that stomping all over our privacy rights IS?
4) why is nothing much really being done about these civil rights violations?
The SJG case is a case in point.  EFF did plenty to help out, but where was the
ACLU?  I see lots of NETTERS mad about clipper, but where is the media blitz?
Where are the demonstrations on the White House lawn?  Are the people in this
country really so apathetic?  Where is the outcry over the Waco massacre?
For a govt to willy-nilly burn a bunch of children to death and lie like hell
to the people the whole time, is enough to start a civil war in a lot of places, yet here it's just another "oh well".  Well before I really get lost here, I will just finish up by saying that I
became a BBS system operator with enthusiasm and happiness, and now find my
self embroiled in the fringes of a bitter war, and one which the general populace seems 100% ignorant of.  I don't care what Mike Godwin says, the
media DO see BBSs as a threat. I just got word that the article that was supposed to be done by a local paper on BBSs in our area was nixed. I don't
like conspiracy theories, but christ, it is almost impossible to get the
media to do anything on the online world that is not negative; the only
VR-oriented movie I have ever seen was a horror film designed to turn people OFF the idea (_Lawnmower_Man_), MTV wants to do stories about neo-
nazis using BBS for their goals; the media worked hand in hand with the govt in the Waco mess, and now the media are generally silent, even supportive,
about the clipper; I try to do my part in distributing crypto, and get legal threats from a govt. contractor...
What gives?  How far is this going to go?

@_subject: cypto + compression 
Just thought of something (I hope it gives someone a business idea, I have
plenty to spare at the moment.)
OK: compression, simplified, works (in several of its manifestations at least)
by replacing redunant parts with a single part that represents 1) what the
replaced parts are, and 2) how many there are.  Thus "feed" could be compressed
as "f!d" where ! = "2 e's".  I know, I know this is a terrible oversimplifica-
tion, but that's the juice of the fruit, no?
OK well if you encrypt a compressed file, there are bound to be lots more
new redundencies created in the encryption process (unless it is something
like ROT-13).  Why not compress this AGAIN, squeezing more space out of the
data?  Sure you can do this manually but things like DES are slow.  What I
am thinking is: have something like zip or compress that compresses, encrypts,
then recompresses, and repeats this process until it can compress no more.
Compression/extraction time will slow down, but for those that NEED heavy-
duty compression, big deal.  It shouldn't really be TOO bad, since this
almost 1/2-assed encryption need not be secure in any way, it could have
a very short key.  Any ideas?  What is wrong with this idea? (something must be, or it would've
been done by now, I am guessing.)  I don't know the math, so I suspect I must've erred gravely somewhere.
