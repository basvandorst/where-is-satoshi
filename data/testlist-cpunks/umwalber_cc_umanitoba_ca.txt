@_subject: ApacheSSL 
An ISP that I have ties with  is looking to set up a secure server.  Currently, they are running Apache.  I told them that for ~$500 they can put on Apache SSL and be all ready.  However, they want to buy Netscape (for the name, I've already given them the 40bit gospel), put it on a separate, firewalled machine, allow no access to it, etc, etc.  Is all this paranoia necessary?

@_subject: Bombs & bomb threats in LA 
I remember seeing an item on TV that had mentioned an acid bomb (it was a
news report about a public access TV show that was showing people how to make bombs).  In this example, some common chemicals were mixed together, tightly closed, and moments later an explosion occured.  They never said the chemicals, for all I know it could have been lemon juice and baking soda in a sealed container, a la Dry Ice bomb...  It didn't look like a bomb of mass destruction, more of a loud bang and a smallish explosion...

@_subject: PGP... 
Nope.  With PGP you get 2 keys... One you keep secret (secret key), the other you make public (public key).  This way, if I want to send you a message, I don't need to talk to you to arrange for a session key or any passcodes, because PGP takes care of it.  Say you wanted to send me a message...
You check your keyring (pgp -kv), but alas my key isn't there.  So you go to the keyserver ( and retreive my key into a file (sean.asc).  Then you run pgp on it (pgp sean.asc) and it gets integrated into your keyring.
Now you type your message to me, and encrypt it with *my* public key, and *sign it with your private key* (pgp -sea message_to_sean.txt 0xD12B3419).  Then you send it off to me.  (The 0xD12B3419 is my key id, and is displayed when you play with my key)
When I get it, I can export it to a file (message.asc), and run pgp on it (pgp message.asc).  Hey, it is signed, so I grab your key from the server, and pgp message.asc it again.  Since you encrypted it with my public key, _only my secret key_ can decrypt it, not even you can see it!  Also, since only you have access to your secret key, (if your signature checks out), I know it had to have been you who wrote the message and it was not tampered with.  (To be technically correct, I don't exactly know it was you, since I haven't trusted your key at this point, but we'll let that one slide)
- From this point, we can send and receive messages pretty easily, since we don't have to snarf keys.  It is also a bit easier than I make it out to be, because there are many automation tools out there for pgp.

@_subject: JavaScript to grab email 
If you don't have a mail server set up, it won't send  (PC version at least).  Fine by me, cuz I just copy the address into Pegasus to send mail.  YMMV.

How does one use the RNG in PGP?  I thought that

@_subject: What constitutes a remailer? 
What really constitutes a remailer (pseudo-anonymous vs anonymous arguments aside)?  For example, the other day I received a message from 66west.com saying that I had a greeting card waiting, I was to go to a certain URL and enter a simple password to retreive my "greeting card".  Now this card had no return address, no name.  Could this constitute a remailer?  A while back there was a thread on how to take some of the responsibility off of the remailer operators (the last one in the chain more so), could this be a viable alternative?  (Actually, I believe it was discussed).  As for tracking, I'm sure the server logs are rotated often, and are not kept forever (our student page server here rotates daily and logs are kept for 4 days AFAIK), so perhaps this may even be less traceable.  Using these greeting cards, what prohibits me from sending a letter instead of "happy birthday"?
Will the anti-remailer people crack down on this also?  I can just see the law "Thou shalt not send greeting cards via email without photoID" :-) Sean Walberg                              umwalber at cc.umanitoba.ca

Unfortunately, you have to buy it.  I got a email from their Customer service department about that yesterday.
