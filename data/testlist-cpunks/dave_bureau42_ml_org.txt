I'm certainly no crypto expert, what with Bruce's book being among the very

@_subject: Cycling For Freedom! 
Hash: SHA1
The Bureau 42 Remailer (remailer at bureau42.ml.org) is proud to announce
"Cycling for Freedom." Basically, this is a chance to help crack RC5/64 and
support the remailer system, and all the good it stands for.
Get the RC5/64 client from  and follow the easy
instructions to configure it for your favorite computer.
Crack a few blocks, send 'em back to the server so that your personal address
shows up in the stats. On the stats page, you can ask the rc5 server to send
you a password that will allow you to join a team. Get that, and then ask to
join the team "rc5 at bureau42.ml.org" (it's listed as team number 1626).
In the event this team finds the winning key, the money will be used for
upgrades and maintenance on the computer housing the bureau42 remailer.
(Specifically, a faster processor would be nice. After that, the rest of the
money will be put away and used to buy/maintain a dedicated connection for
that computer.) Thanks in advance for helping to support the remailer, and (more importantly)
helping crack RC5/64.

@_subject: ISP signatures on outgoing mail 
Very much depends on how `ISP' is defined.  All my mail now comes in
via UUCP, which is another port (540, I think).  Outgoing mail goes
to another system which is run from a friend's house, and therefore
probably doesn't count as an ISP (again, UUCP).
It certainly _can_ be done.  Almost anything _can_ be done.
Whether it should (and in this case, it shouldn't!) be done is another issue.

Sadly, I have to concur with the previous comments - but I'll go one better.
Send me twenty bucks a month to cover the local phone company's charges
for a second line, and I can get latency down to under an hour.  I'll just
put in an every-15-minutes-or-so crontab to dial up, fetch my system's mail,
and process it.
I wouldn't, and I hope not many other remailer operators would either.
A lot of the security on my machine comes from having physical control over
it. (That includes the ability to rapidly delete things with extreme
prejudice should the spooks come knocking at the door.) If I'm not sleeping
in the room next to my machine, I don't have that kind of control.
Also, I can't afford a second machine so I have to keep this one around for
personal use :(

I would feel better, and I'm sure a lot of others would too, if I had the
time to safely wipe the remailer's private key (in addition to cleaning the
passphrase from memory). Ditto for my personal keys :)
More or less. It's more like "of the last 1000 messages sent, 9964 of 'em have made it back
to me."  Because of the way I have to have things set up, there are almost
always a few messages in transit. I have, very occasionally, actually seen my
remailer listed at 100%; somewhere over 99% is far more common.
Excellent. You certainly can't be faulted for that :)
I thought that much was a given.  AFAIK nobody's making any money anywhere
off the remailer net; it's a labour of love.
To contribute to another thread at the same time: there is a
semi-experimental hack for Mixmaster that parses a message for hashcash.
IMO, it's unlikely that hashcash, Digicash, or anything else is likely to
become the preeminent modus operandi for remailer operators anytime soon, but
it's likely to happen eventually simply because it's possible, so someone
will do it. For me, the remailer doesn't consume any exceptional new
resources, so the added cost to me of running a remailer is very nearly zero.
(Those are mostly the "administrative" costs of dealing with complaints,
adding people to the blocklist, and cleaning up after the occasional spam
bomb.)  Others, with different circumstances, may be more eager to pursue a
profit-making solution.

The closest to a noticeable change I've spotted is that the simple

default. (No longer do they have to be downloaded separately and hacked in
by hand.)  There are more complex anti-relaying configurations that can be
specified now, also (for permitting certain parties/domains to relay, or
to only restrict certain groups from relaying).
