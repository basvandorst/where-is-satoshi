That doesn't work under SunOS 4.1.x, but this does:
   date "+%S %M 60 * + %H 3600 * + %j 86400 * + %y 31536000 * + p" | dc
This assumes 365 days/year, so if you jump from a leap year to a non-leap
year it won't work right.  Hey - a 1/1460 failure rate is better
than most Windoze programs I've used ;-)
It also isn't the "absolute" time, (as given by time()), but
gives a number of seconds that constantly increases.
With a little more work you should be able to adjust this to be close
to time() functionality.

@_subject: Timing Attacks 
But, what if one of the computers is connected on a "hostile" lan.
For example - your typical student PC running in a grad-student office
or on the network in the dorms.  Sniffing packets from it shouldn't be
too hard (yes, good ethernet concentrators make it harder - but not
impossible).  These packets will give you the necessary timing information.
What if that is a PC running Windoze or single-user Linux?  Then there
aren't likely to be fluctuating load averages.  The advesary is
close to the one end, and away you go......
Of course, targeting a server is much more pratical in terms of what
you may gain access to.  Several congested network hops will generate
lots of delays, BUT what about the 4:00am hit from the dialup terminal servers that happen to be on the same ethernet as the secure server.
This would be a normal situation for many ISPs.
All of that said - I think that this is more pratical in the "lab"
than on the net.  But, it is a very clever approach to the
problem of cracking a crypto system.  It serves us all a good example
that we need to leave NO stone unturned when examining a system.

The only way this can work is if the server is told it is a 50%/75%/etc
size ACK, and then latter the server is ACKed for the full 100%. Why?  Because what happens if the client dies immediately after doing the ACK - maybe only 51% of that space has been searched, yet the server has already seen an ACK for it.
IMO - a % ACK is to much complexity and extra work on the server,
which is already having trouble keeping up.

In a word - no.
In a longer description - you can black box test the *pseudo-RNG in
one of two ways.  One, input a key, and then keep asking for numbers.  The numbers should be statistically distributed, and should have a very long repeat cycle.  (i.e. basic "good" pseudo-random number generator
Two, input different keys, and then ask for a number.  Again,
the numbers should be statistically distributed, even for small
changes in the input numbers.  What *both* of those methods don't test, is the key(seed) generation,
which is what was attacked on Netscape.  The seed number
must be truely random, and unknowable to the attacker, otherwise
they can duplicate the random number generator.  Remember that
all random number generators in software are really pseudo-random
number generators, and rely on having seed value.
BTW: In some ways, I feel sorry for Netscape being nailed by everyone
including the press like this.  BUT - they must also accept that
with being popular, that they will be subject to intense scrutiny.  Besides - if you are going to attack a cryptosystem, why
not get your 15 minutes of fame out of deal while you are at it ;-)

@_subject: Securing Internet mail at the MTA level 
With the question of "Do you want object security or link security
for email?"  The answer is (as with all security questions) "What
is your threat model?"
For example:  Your company does not have mailreaders capable
of doing encryption (at least not easy enough for average users).
Your supplier has the same situation.  You have accepted this fact for the time being, and trust that your employees
won't tinker with the email if they want their job for long.
However, the email you send to your supplier and vice-versa should not go over the Internet unencrypted as it potentially contains sensitive information. So, a link-level encryption that the two co-operating sys-admins can set up would be a good solution.  This would
be easier to set up and maintain than a encrypted router tunnel
through the net, and solve your problem.
Of course, I'll submit that object security on email would be preferable, but that might not be pratical right now.

While an Errors-To: field can't hurt, it shouldn't be
needed.  The problem is *broken* gateways.  There are
plenty of properly set up and running Banyan and CC-mail
gateways, we just need to harass the admins into
running the broken ones properly.
Let me quote from "scripture" (RFC-822) below in a typical message
I send to such idiots.  This particular person had neither
the use Sender: set up correctly, or a postmaster address.
----- included message ----
Your SMTP to Banyan gateway is broken and missing a postmaster address.
I sent a message to cypherpunks at toad.com, to which someone
at your site is apparently subscribed.  The listserver at toad.com
correctly puts a "Sender:" field in the header of all outgoing
messages, and according to RFC-822 all SMTP handleing agents
must send any bounces to that address.
RFC-822 specifically states (starting at line  in rfc-822.txt)
     4.4.4.  AUTOMATIC USE OF FROM / SENDER / REPLY-TO
        For systems which automatically  generate  address  lists  for
        replies to messages, the following recommendations are made:
            o   The "Sender" field mailbox should be sent  notices  of
                any  problems in transport or delivery of the original
                messages.  If there is no  "Sender"  field,  then  the
                "From" field mailbox should be used.
Also, RFC-822 states that you must have an address of postmaster
that people can send email to  (starting at line  in rfc-822.txt)
     6.3.  RESERVED ADDRESS
          It often is necessary to send mail to a site, without  know-
     ing  any  of its valid addresses.  For example, there may be mail
     system dysfunctions, or a user may wish to find  out  a  person's
     correct address, at that site.
          This standard specifies a single, reserved  mailbox  address
     (local-part)  which  is  to  be valid at each site.  Mail sent to
     that address is to be routed to  a  person  responsible  for  the
     site's mail system or to a person with responsibility for general
     site operation.  The name of the reserved local-part address is:
                                Postmaster
     so that "Postmaster at domain" is required to be valid.
     Note:  This reserved local-part must be  matched  without  sensi-
            tivity to alphabetic case, so that "POSTMASTER", "postmas-
            ter", and even "poStmASteR" is to be accepted.
So, please fix your gateway, or contact Banyan on how to
correctly configure it.

Marketing Fluff - read "we don't *want* to revel it".  Patent stuff doesn't
take long to get the initial disclosures filed.  Cypherpunks are generally engineers and are immune to such crap.  So.  Large "random" prime numbers are generated.  From what?  How?
Obviously these act as keys to your "OTP".  Figure out how to match this prime and you can generate the same "OTP".
So the data coming out appears random.  Big whoopie.  Lots of algorithms
can generate the same thing.
The key is how do you seed that random number generator? This isn't even close to being a OTP.  A OTP by definition has a random
set of data that is transmitted to the receipient over a seperate
secure channel from the actual message to be sent.  The actual message
and the OTP are XOR'ed together and sent.  The receipient then XORs
the OTP and the encrypted message to get plaintext.
That is pretty simple - even a marketing drone should be able to figure
that one out.
Now - explain how (in generic terms) your system acts as a OTP.
Yes - hopefully someone will take the time and money to decompile it.
.... but if you are so sure of yourself,
why not give away some demo copies.  Why not source of the security
functions?  (Shove that patent crap someplace - you wouldn't be selling it if your disclosures weren't already filed)

Optical amplifiers -  they are in use all right.  Want to buy one?
My employer sells them.  (get out a big checkbook though -

This is essentially true for the purpose of quantum-crypto. The cascade of phontons triggered from the incoming photons would
mask most of your original phontons - necesitating a secure "repeater".
Power for the amps must be electrical.  So, a seperate power cable must
be run seperate with the optical-fiber.  This normally isn't a problem
since the casing/etc of the fibers has lots of metal for protection anyways.
Very nice! ;-)  Flouride based amplifiers should be able to handle up
to 16 channels.  Using state of the art time-multiplex stuff of 10 Gb/sec
gives a total throughput of 160 Gb/Sec.... smoking!
Of course the parts for all of this will set you pack a sizeable chunk of change.

public review. I spent most of my time pushing for some sort of peer review.
Supposedly they have talked with Schneier and Denning, about
the method but neither has done more than talk with them briefly about the method.  (I understood from what he said that they weren't willing to pay Bruce what it
would take to do a through review. ;-)
I also spent some time educating them about PGP
and how it does do compression, ASCII armour, etc.
All in all they guy was plesant enough, but no real details on how the system works.  What I got was that
they "private" key is what you type in.  This is then hashed (he even used the word hash) into a 22 character
public key that you share with your friends.  Even at 8 bits/charcter, 176 bits doesn't sound secure
for a public key algorithm, but then again this isn't
RSA we are looking at.
All in all it still sounds like snake oil to me!

For those of you who are privacy-cypherpunks - there is
another list (run by big-brother) out there on the issue.
  Subscription Address: PRIVACY-REQUEST at FTC.GOV
  Owner: John Audette   Last Update: 12/28/95
  Description:
   A mailing list created bt the US Federal Trade Commission to allow
   interested parties to discuss the issues surrounding the privacy
   interests of consumers visiting web sites.  It is part of the FTC's
   "Privacy Initiative" to investigate whether the information
   collected at websites (either that affirmatively submitted by a
   visitor via a form or information collected based upon a visitor's
   selection of pages at a site to reflect personal interests) should
   be the subject of regulation by the FTC.

Put your 2 brain cells together and think for a minute.
If you read the stuff - you can see that the bill talks about
key-escrow, BUT you can escrow the key with yourself if
you so desire.  It also does not put up any mandates for
key-escrow requirements in encryption systems.
The bill also will force relaxation of the export restrictions.
I hope - you could read and understand that 5 line "executive"

There are provisions for exporting DES for banking purposes. Generally it is a hardware card that "can't" be reused outside of the banking transfer machine.  I don't know the details
of how such licenses are applied for, but I have a friend you used to work in that area.
On 128-bit DH - No-where near big enough.

I've sanded my finger tips down rather well with a belt sander and a fine grit belt on numerous occasions.

prints after such an operation.

@_subject: Past one terabit/second on fiber 
The ads say they are selling it - that doesn't mean shipping it... yet
at least.  (Note that my employer is a direct competitor of Lucent so I have a vested interest in setting the facts straight)
Yes - this is still very much a lab situation only though.
It will be quite a few years before we hit that in real systems.
An OC48 signal (~2.5 Gb/sec) will handle 48 T3's or 48 * 672 voice calls.
Multiply by 8 for 20 Gb/second and you get 258048 voice calls.
Pretty close to 300k I guess.
I don't know that any number fiber cable is "standard" but 36-fiber cable is not unusual.  To find the capacity of a cable, you
have to cut the number of fibers in half (as you did) because
generally each fiber is used only for a single direction of traffic.
You then have to cut it in half again because phone companies have everything redundant.  So, for a connection between two cities,
there are generally 2 cables in different locations (so one backhoe
doesn't get both), with on average only 1/2 the fibers in each carrying paying traffic.
I can't vouch much for your cost numbers - other than to apply the factor of 2 adjustment noted above.  I would add that much of a phone companies cost is in billing and customer service, etc.
Not the cost of installing and maintaining the fiber and equipement.
This is how the smaller carriers buy lots of bandwidth off of the
big guys, and remove all the billing, etc. problems to themselves.
They big guys are still making money selling the bandwidth, and the
little guy makes his profit by selling for slightly less
than the big guy and somehow making his billing, customer service, etc.
cost him less.
Internet telephony should make the use of bandwidth even more
efficient - thereby cutting costs.  The big guys who own
the fibers will still make money - the pipes that carry internet
traffic are still needed.  But the little guys will get squeezed out.
(until they become ISPs ;-).  Internet traffic could theoretically
be carried over this large amount of protection fiber (mentioned above)
that is out there for a much lower marginal cost than the current T3 or OC3 pipes that are being used.  The only "problem" being that these
are lower priority channels, so that if a failure occurs anywhere,
the traffic on them is dropped.  Most customers are demanding high uptimes so much that the idea of a very lost cost, but much less reliable service hasn't caught on yet.

@_subject: The Crisis with Remailers 
Wouldn't the "income" from other cover generators help cover the cost
of a remailer running its own cover generator?
Also - remailers could possibly give postage free service to traffic for other remailers.... i.e. only the last node (who has the most exposure anyways) would require payment.

@_subject: An alternative to remailer shutdowns 
This could be done with no "storage" as well, by a slightly
different method and still require end reciepient acknowledgement.
The end reciepient could be required to reply and include the encrypted
message. The remailer would then decrypt the message and send back the
plaintext.  Only storage would be the key vs. a message id database.
By reduction - you could just do a rot13 on the message and
append the "legal notice".   If all the information for decoding
a message is present in that message, is a different encoding
mechanism really any different from straight ASCII text?
(i.e. Netscape 9.13 might have auto decoding built it....)
Then, the user doesn't do anything "extra" - does this invalidate
the notice?
I might be wrong, but I don't think that this second method would
gain you anything in the 2 situations where operators will get
hassled.  1) Posting of copyrighted material - the lawyers will
at least harass you no matter what kind of legal notice is up front.
2) Mailing of "harassing" information - the person still gets
unwanted email, and has no way to stop it.
Heaven forbid that I use spammers as an idea base, but
to borrow something from them.... Set up the headers
on an anonymous message such that a Reply would result in
the user automatically being placed on the "deny" list.
This means that only 1 message gets through.... but, as
Hal has noted, that might be 1 message too many.
Similarily, a message sent to the user could be the
"knock", and then a reply would automatically add the
user to the "allow" list as well as forward the
message.... just an automatination of the "knock" idea.

Nothing else makes sense.

@_subject: Snake-Oil FAQ 
Libel/Slander is very different from doing a review.  Unfortunately,
in todays legal climate, it is way to easy to find a lawyer that
will harass someone for a negative review.  Unless you are prepared to fight such a legal battle, it is much easier to do anonymous reviews, and build up a reputation as a good reviewer
through use of signatures, etc.
If you have a good product, and get negative reviews, the truth
will come out eventually through other channels.  Either the product
really isn't good, or the reviewer loses his reputation and his messages
descend into the noise.
Thats life - deal with it!
