Every Sunday in 2000 after Thanksgiving Day, the Surveillance Camera
Players will lead a Surveillance Camera Outdoor Walking Tour (or SCOWT for
short) of a neighborhood in New York City. Three different SCOWTS have been
scheduled; others may follow in 2001.
Each SCOWT includes a general introduction to the emerging surveillance
society as well as a choice selection of video cameras that surveill public
space. $10 donation per each person. Each tour lasts about 90 minutes and
is undertaken rain or shine. No reservations needed. Call 212 561 0106 for
more information. SCP web site: e-mail: notbored at panix.com
