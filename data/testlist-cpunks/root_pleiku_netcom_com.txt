@_subject: ANON SITES: 
The present plan prosed by John Gilmore is good 3-4 U.S. Sites willing
to risk litigation and counter-litigation. And I have a another sort of plan
that still really requires an out of country A-server(anonymous posting server).
A number of PGP-related services may be set up behind such a screen.
Having PGP encryption in the style of PAX would be crucial to maintain
the anonymity of such services.
 Michael Grafs PGP Key-Server
 Anonymous Digital "face" banks(ala Chaum)
 Gray Market Exchange
 Encrypted Anonymous Mailing Lists(Example: Dark Technology)
 Data Havens.
 alt.whistleblowers(really "hearing aid" see Brunner, J. "Shockwave Rider"
A vast network of anonymous servers may be maintained behind the screen
of a single foreign site A-server ready to come on line at a single command
if suppression attempts are experienced.
However AARM type scripts will continue to be a threat,I
also think we should look at the possibility of both
port 25 and port 119 manipulation with auto-search and random selection
of NNTP and SMTP open servers as well as header addition to confuse
path analysis... I know this is normally regarded as unprofitable but
considering what we are up against...
Addition dialup slip and ppp hosts could use a variety of 9.6-56kb
dialup sites to provide rotating xntp synchronized anonymous
posting and mail services.Uucp sites could play as
well on email-based services via uucp.
Are any foreign sites up for running David Clunies PAX Code???

I am forced to agree with you here..... I dont think we have
the "juice" to carry off a maximum effort at this point...
I would gladly volunteer to setup such a site AND I would
need a peacenet feed instead of the "gratis" connections
I obtain from netcom.... I AM already uncoercible... as
you well know and I would need you as well as others in backing
on this effort...OK kids... Here we have one volunteer if we can get at least 3 other sites(my mininum buyin is 4 US sites)....
Hey John... what about you???
      cheers
      kelly
p.s. I would be willing to maintain a PAX type anon operation
as well as an anon-remailer.....and a KEY server...
 would also offer the PGP archives via mail server...
note that I am uucp connected and would need to upgrade
to 56 kb leased or V-FAST technology...

@_subject: POLITICAL DISPERSION: Contact with Christic Institute 
Hi All,
       Due to a recent posting in alt.conspiracy I was finally able
to make contact with the Christic Institute. These are the people who were
continually suing the CIQA during the 80's for violations of intelligence laws. They were almost completely wiped out
by questionable decisions in a federal lawsuit and loss of their
non-profit tax status during the last days of the bush administration.
     Their present status is as follows, 286/AT class machines 20-30 mb
hard disks, 1200 baud connectivity only. and have said they will attempt
to acquire a 9600 baud modem...(maybe someone on the list has a spare
that they could donate).
they have only 1 person who knows about "software" and he sounds
like he doesnt have a whole lot of time on his hands
I was either thinking about obtaining a pubnix account on their behalf..(
 or cheap commercial
shell account(netcom). or installing waffle along with pgp2.2 and praying.
Any suggestions from the group would be welcome. BTW I have
worked at expressing the power and connectivity of the internet to him.
I dont know how much sunk in at the time.The person I talked to was
       	310-287-1559 FAX
In addition I have been attempting to make contact with the Santa Cruz Action Team to get them connected. I
will be making contact with many human rights/eco/etc groups
over the next month...(I feel like a crypto-anarchist Johnny Appleseed)

@_subject: ANON:  Anonymized Mailing Lists 
Hi There,
       Has any one combined PGP2.2 and one of the mailing lists
servers such as MajorDomo to produce an Anonymous  multiple recipient
Mailing List?
I know David Clunie was working on this for PAX at one point but he didnt finish it I believe.
     Any one got anything like this?
     cheers

I would like the complete text Paul... JFK really said all this...
fascinating... puts a WHOLE new perspective on the assasination with
taken in combination with "DEEP BLACK, Puzzle Palace and Deadly Deceits"
   REALLY makes me wonder....
