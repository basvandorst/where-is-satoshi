       went looking myself once so I could machine some .308 bt  in DU
found it in an industrial catalogue catering to the large oceangoing
sailboat industry... this was circa 1986... if I would still interested that
is where I would start my research...(i.e. lee lapin and scott french(
"whole spy cataloge, bigbrother game" etc ) is where I got that hint...

the expression "good enough for Assasination Politics" came to be regarded
as high praise for digital cash systems that were tight enough for

@_subject: AARG and eugene are net.loons-why signatures of binaries always 
Hi all,
     Its obvious that some of us here are developers and still others
have never typed make or gcc in their lives.
    -v and -V options given to various forms of ld caused the embeddment of version information in the binary(Sunpro does this also, AND early versions
of MSC allowed embeddment of version information also.)
The fact that most environments dont link -Bstatic and instead link
-Bdynamic means that every time you attempt to produce a binary from
2 different systems that the dynamic link information will
be different checkout link.h link_elf.h link_aout.h in /usr/include
in addition MOST modern developement environments include a date field
when compiled and linked in the binary
     sheesh

BTW.   AARG and eugene are idiots nyah nyah nyah!!
