Here's some info about the Sunnyvale patent library.  You can walk-in
and do it all yourself, for free.  Bring a few rolls of dimes, since
they don't make change and their copiers don't have mag-cards.  Or,
you can put down a deposit and have them copy patents and mail or fax
them to you.  I've done it both ways.
It's on a back street, in an old elementary school complex.  A bit
hard to find.  Call for directions.  It's worth spending a day there
e.g. looking up crypto patents, if your days aren't in short supply.
I found the microcode to the 68000 in there, among other things.
