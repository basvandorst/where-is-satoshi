PUBLICATIONS AND SELECTED PRESS
openPDS allows users to collect, store, and give fine-grained access to their data all while protecting their privacy.
With the rise of smartphones and their built-in sensors as well as web-apps, an increasing amount of personal data is being silently collected. Personal data–digital information about users’ location, calls, web-searches, and preferences–is undoubtedly the oil of the new economy. However, the lack of access to the data makes it very hard if not impossible for an individual to understand and manage the risks associated with the collected data. Therefore, advancements in using and mining this data have to evolve in parallel with considerations about ownership and privacy.
Many of the initial and critical steps towards individuals data ownership are technological. Given the huge number of data sources that a user interacts with on a daily basis, interoperability is not enough. Rather, the user needs to actually own a secured space, a Personal Data Store (PDS) acting as a centralized location where his data live. Owning a PDS would allow the user to view and reason about the data collected. The user can then truly control the flow of data and manage fine-grained authorizations for accessing his data.

Dang kids. Get offa my lawn.
It’s been interesting, I’ll say that much. I have people on their honeymoon here in .ai asking to see me, buy me and Mrs. RAH $30 hamburgers at Viceroy, etc.
Or “prove”, “stylometrically", on various Bitcoin fora, that I'm Satoshi. Heh. I’ll never get tired of braggin’ about *that* one. :-) I expect others here know where the stylistic clues came from, but I think Grigg has the right approach to that question. Leave well enough alone.
Being, even now, generally optimistic about the future, if not my own in particular, I can’t help thinking there’s a pony in there somewhere. I *do* find it annoying that the only time people wanna talk to me about this stuff is at the top of a bubble. I expect that it may be a hint from the Almighty I should pay attention to. At the moment, PayPal, which we all looked down the nose at back then, is still, um, printing money, and a cypherpunk gave me some BTC a little while ago, a kind of eating-the-dog food exercise for old time’s sake. Or something. The price has since fallen 40%, but it’s bouncing back, and will probably be fine. “You have to be *this* tall to take this ride”, as another friend said about Bitcoin prices last week. Meanwhile I can’t think of anything I want to spend it on anyway.
Even in its current form, Bitcoin makes rather short work of those speed bumps Mr. May used to tell us about, which *may* be the real point to the exercise.
Having to file several kinds of forms to get paid for a small consulting job as US citizen outside the US was enough to make me foreswear getting paid for much of anything anymore, anything small at least, and BTC solves several problems there quite handily, push ever came to shove. Besides, my passport is stamped “Employment Prohibited”, which, apparently, I’m evidently honoring even in the breach.
So, I think BTC, or something like it, would make a nice numeraire, temporary or otherwise, having gnawed at the edges of *that* problem when most of the Bitcoinners were, as Marc notes, in short-pants. Yes, even in its current volatile state. And contrary to the opinions of people who know better than I do about these things.
It wasn't quite what Dr. Fama got the Nobel for, but New Monetary Economics might be as good once as it ever was, and Bitcoin might be the camel’s nose under that particular tent, and given that it is the ultimate fiat currency that’s quite an assertion.
As someone whose stated goal, back in the day, was to securitize *everything*, debt, equity, cash, services, title to assets in storage, transit, or just sitting there with a house on it, cats, dogs, mass hysteria -- and all derivatives thereof -- using bearer-transaction financial cryptography protocols on a ubiquitous geodesic public internetwork, Bitcoin *is* a bit, oh, please let me say it, self-referent as a solution. I saw it blow by here on this list, said, “meh”, shortly had the magic smoke go out of most of my internet presence by a power-spike in a hurricane, and never got around to paying attention to either Bitcoin, or the internet, very much at all until various people frog-marched my attention back into focus recently with me muttering variously about being too old for this shit anymore...
So, Bitcoin, if it survives, makes a *nice* hack, by solving, what Barnes, and ultimately everyone else, called the “loading problem”. And, so far at least, it solves the “and then you go to jail” part of the book-entry transaction error-handler, something Barnes was also noted for saying. That, too, only if Bitcoin survives. "...any [network] architecture that can survive a nuclear attack can survive withdrawal of government subsidy...” Godwin said on Cyberia, long ago. I’ve jokingly called it his Second Law. I suppose the Strong Form of that hypothesis, speaking of Dr. Fama, is surviving not mere withdrawal of the implicit subsidy of monopolistic contract enforcement, and all transfer-priced assets and “externalities” appertaining thereto, but also active attack from the ostensible contract enforcer itself.
I hear of others, well, gnawing around the edges, actually, of securitizing other stuff with variants of the Bitcoin protocol, but, like predicting the end of the world, expanding the blockchain to other assets "has not been found agreeable to experience.” So far as I can see.
Meanwhile, Chris Odom, aka, “Fellow Traveller”, aka, “Lovedrop” (yes, *that* “Lovedrop”), is banging away on something called Open Transactions, which inserts an actual transaction protocol, among other much more interesting things, into the works to glue Bitcoin and other stuff onto, for starters, Wagner Blinding, using, for starters, Ben Laurie’s lucre code. I haven’t seen a code-stoke like the one I see Chris with, well, since the old days. Which is nice. Very nice. Big grins all around, down here in the elbow of the Caribbean. Apparently, like me, he noticed that he was delivering instantly-usable product now, and getting paid later, too much later usually. I discovered cypherpunks in late spring of 1994 looking for a solution to something Barnes (again) called the “latency” problem. Chriss bumped into the gold-silver-crypto list, I think, about 10 years later.
Mr. Odom has been been kind enough to involve me in testing OT a bit, and, ultimately, I’ve more-or-less bailed on iterative break-it-and-fix-it. Mostly because I don’t have the patience for testing — much less writing — code, if I ever really did. But here’s the rub, I also I have no *idea* what I, personally, would do with Open Transactions these days even if I could get it running in production.
I have lots of ideas in *general*, you understand, but they’re mostly of the “let’s you and him fight” variety. Many more people than *I* would have to be involved, they, and I, would risk much more than money, and, ultimately, I’m not sure any of it would work. It’s a drag to think that most of what I’m interested in doing requires the dissolution, or at least dissipation, of The World’s Only Remaining Superpower to happen. As someone who still, barely, calls himself mostly an anarcho-capitalist but still a patriot, that’s about the only thing worse than only being interesting to other people during the top of a bubble. Yup. A Mass of Contradictions, as usual.
"Let’s you and him fight" is only two or three steps removed from Mr. Briceno’s original observation, I figure.
Hell, even “set here next to the rockin' chair, sonny, and I’ll tell ya a story”, is, ultimately, not much more help than “get off my lawn”, when you get right down to it...

@_subject: Obituary: Hal Finney | The Economist 
Hal Finney
AS IT turned out, Hal Finney was not Satoshi Nakamoto. But for a short while, at least, some people thought he might be. “Satoshi Nakamoto” is the most famous non-person on the internet. The name is a pseudonym, meant to hide the shadowy programmer (or programmers) behind Bitcoin, a computerised currency designed to liberate money from the control of any central bank. Speculating about his true identity is a popular pastime in some of the more esoteric corners of the web.
Still, Mr Finney was a good guess. As a cryptographer and a programmer he had the skills, for Bitcoin relies on cryptography to function. Having been an early adopter (he was, with the fabled Mr Nakamoto, a partner in the world’s first ever Bitcoin transaction) he certainly had the pedigree. And he had the beliefs, too. He was one of the original “cypherpunks”, a small, influential band of cryptographers, philosophers and programmers who, in the early 1990s, helped stamp the early internet with its culture of rebelliousness, distrust of government and optimistic belief in the liberating power of technology.
Two decades before Edward Snowden put the subject on front pages the world over, the cypherpunks were discussing how the coming age of the internet would allow governments and companies to pry ever more deeply and easily into the lives of their citizens and customers. But that same computer revolution would also hand ordinary people the power to fight back against the organisations that presumed to run their lives. Until that point, good quality encryption had been something available only to spy agencies and big companies. Computers would give people the power to carve out a mathematically guaranteed refuge from the powers that be, and to have a conversation that was provably, reliably private.
For Mr Finney, who had spent his high-school years imbibing the supercharged libertarianism of Ayn Rand, and who was now earning a living writing video games, that was a heady challenge. He accepted it with gusto. “Here we are faced with the problems of loss of privacy, creeping computerisation, massive databases, more centralisation,” he wrote. “[But] the computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them.” His aim was clear: “The work we are doing here, broadly speaking, is dedicated to this goal of making Big Brother obsolete.”
He began helping, unpaid, with a program called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), putting in enough hours that it became a second job. It was well-named: even today, messages scrambled with it are thought to be unbreakable (Mr Snowden used PGP for his e-mail exchanges with the journalists to whom he leaked his documents). In 1991 Phil Zimmermann, PGP’s chief developer, uploaded it to the internet. America’s spies were aghast. Exporting encryption—which was classed as a weapon—was illegal. And here a group of self-proclaimed techno-liberators were proposing to just hand it over to anyone in the world—diplomat, criminal, teenager—who wanted it. When the legal kerfuffle died down, Mr Zimmermann hired Mr Finney as his new company’s second-ever employee.
Suspended animation
For a long time he ran a free “remailer”, a server designed to forward e-mail anonymously, no questions asked, to anyone in the world. Whose business was it, after all, what people wanted to send to each other, except the sender and the recipient? His interests extended beyond privacy. He was fascinated by the sorts of futures that technology might unlock, speculating about everything from how morals evolve in rich societies to when clean energy might finally displace fossil fuels. Away from the screen, he was chatty and gregarious, a keen skier and runner.
He had to stop in 2009, when he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND). The illness gradually paralyses its victims, but, with characteristic logic, Mr Finney pointed out that it was not a death sentence—even when those muscles necessary for breathing gave out, life could carry on with the aid of a mechanical ventilator. He was surprised, he said, to discover that most people with the disease “chose” death instead. After all, MND robs sufferers only of their bodies, not their minds, and for him it was the mind that mattered. His interests went beyond computers and coding, to sociology, psychology and how technology might improve society. As long as there was a way to communicate with the outside world—even if it was only by having a computer interpret the twitchings of a facial muscle—he wanted to endure.
When even that became difficult, he put a final plan into action. In accordance with his wishes, he was disconnected from his ventilator. As soon as he had been declared legally dead, technicians from a firm called Alcor froze his body in liquid nitrogen. He became one of a few hundred people who have elected to have their bodies stored until medicine advances to the point where it can safely revive them and cure their original ailments. It sounds (and is) science-fictional, and Mr Finney was under no illusions about the prospects of waking up again. But placing his faith in a technology that has yet to be invented was a rational gamble for a committed techno-optimist. And besides, a slim hope is better than none at all.

What Exactly Is Encryption?

In times like these, it’s easy to be paranoid.
Concerned by reports of hacking, data breaches and government spying, companies and consumers are looking for better ways to protect their data. Many are turning to encryption, a method of encoding messages that goes back millennia. Encryption is commonly used to secure online banking sessions and to protect credit-card data. But for the average computer user, it remains a mystery.
Here’s a brief guide to help readers unlock its secrets.
How does encryption work?
If you saw the recent movie “The Imitation Game,” you’ve seen a rudimentary, by modern standards, form of encryption. During World War II, the Germans used a machine to turn military messages into coded strings of symbols. These days, computers running complex mathematical formulas can do the same thing much faster, and the codes are much harder to crack.
What’s it used for?
If you’ve ever done banking online, you may have noticed a “lock” icon in the address bar, or that the bar turned green. That means the browser session is encrypted by your bank.
Consumers can download a growing crop of encryption tools for texting, browsing sessions and video and phone calls. Users usually must download an app or install software that scrambles messages as they are sent. (The recipient needs to be using the same app or software to unscramble the message.)
Apple has started encrypting personal data on its latest mobile operating system, iOS 8. This means an outsider who hacks into a device or into Apple’s servers would see a string of unreadable characters instead of actual messages or FaceTime videos.
Can I encrypt email messages?
Yes, but it’s tricky. Sender and receiver must use the same type of encryption. If you have encryption switched on, but the friend you’re emailing doesn’t have it, he or she won’t be able to read your message.
Since the revelations of former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden about electronic eavesdropping by the NSA, big tech companies have made moves to add encryption. Yahoo Inc. and Google Inc. both have announced plans to begin encrypting emails of users of their services, but the projects are moving slowly.
Can encryption really protect me from getting hacked?
Maybe. If a hacker obtains the encryption keys, or the formula that unlocks the code, all that encrypting was for naught. And that happens all the time in corporate data breaches, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and senior analyst focusing on security issues at market-research firm Gartner Inc. For example, as part of the 2007 breach at TJX Cos., hackers stole a TJX point-of-sale card-reader system and brought it home. The hackers were able to break the code used to encrypt card transactions and stole data from tens of millions of customer accounts.
How can I get started?
In addition to Apple’s built-in encryption in its new mobile devices, Android users can download WhatsApp, which encrypts text messages. WhatsApp, a company owned by Facebook Inc., says it is working on offering encryption for all communication sent between WhatsApp users, including images, audio and text.
A number of vendors—including Voltage Security Inc., Protegrity and RSA Security, a unit of EMC Corp. —offer encryption of corporate data, including email and credit-card records. Silent Circle’s Blackphone is a phone for corporate users that can send encrypted voice calls, text, emails and other data—if both parties are using a Blackphone.
Why isn’t everything encrypted? There are plenty of reasons. Encryption is time-consuming and difficult to implement. It’s hard to properly manage who has access to encryption keys, and it slows system performance.

Patents and copyrights aren’t property. They’re government granted monopolies. They’re no more property than your driver’s license. Property is the application of mind to *matter*, to quote a great Flash animation. An idea can not be property. Ever.
So. Again. If it’s *encrypted*, and I have the key, it’s my property. I control the physical bits. Otherwise it’s not my property.

ObPedantry: Anselm was not an Arab, his reductive "proof of god" as “perfect" parlor trick notwithstanding.
There were *no* Arab philosophers, much less "really smart" ones. Avicenna, for instance, was Persian, and like most Arab-conquered middle eastern types by then, regurgitated earlier Greek text using Indian astronomy math, including the zero, finance, (the foreign exchange contract, the letter of credit, and the demand-deposit check, say), and science. A bare fraction of which was actually “saved” by rampaging Islamic Arab rapine, physical, intellectual, and otherwise. There were *copies*, even better ones, of the contents of the Library at Alexandria, all over the ancient middle east, and even after it was burned by both Ceasar and a Bishop or two, it was the Muslims who actually burned its entire contents. And all the other libraries besides.
Averroes, another leading “Arab” philosophical light, was a Spaniard. And an Aristotelian. So no new philosophy there, either. All of Arab “contributions” to “civilization” were derivative. The lateen sail was Roman (“Lateen”, geddit?), for instance. Damascus steel was Indian wootz steel.
The Arabs' principal accomplishment, if you can call it that, was destroying the ancient world wherever they went, and replacing it with abject barbarism for most of a thousand years. Their piracy in the Mediterranean killed trade between east and west, (and north and south) for the entirety of their command of it and was the proximal cause of the Dark Ages in the West. Their contribution to philosophy, if one could call it that, was to declare, after they got sick of listening to Persians and Egyptians prattle badly-regurgitated Greek for a century or so, that *nothing* happens without god’s will, which obviated the need for cause and effect at all. You struck two stones together, and god *decided* that there would be a spark, you see. Which is how the world got blessed with Sharia “law” and all the rest of Islam’s barbaric world view.
As long as there can be nothing unless God wills it, there can be no Islamic science. At least the Orthodox and the Catholics had to somehow incorporate cause and effect into their view of the world, or there would not be any sin. Seeding their own intellectual demise, at least, at the hands of the scientific method later on.
In the west, philosophy was made the “handmaiden” of theology for more than fifteen hundred years. For a thousand of those years, philosophy in Islam was a shit-house slave.
Philosophy didn’t actually occur in the west until Newton figured out how to use mathematics to deal with infinity in order to calculate the motion of objects. Discovered *again*, apparently. Palimpsests have been recovered from Orthodox codices made of scraped-over scrolls containing Archimedes (who else? :-)), dealing in infinitesimals, at least, if not the actual epsilons and deltas which finally nailed calculus to mathematical terra-firma by Bolzano in 1817. After Newton, a veritable festival of philosophical navel-gazing began in the West after, with the possible exception of the Stoics and Cynics, almost two thousand years. All to collapse again after Godel proved he was his own grandpa. Or, at least, he *could*, Groucho, belong to a club that would have him as a member.
And, of course, Existentialism, like Freudianism, is merely literature. Okay. Freudianism is really *bad* literature, with Freud conflating Oedipus with Hamlet. Besides, being, you know, proven to be unfalsifiable pseudoscience, in the same breath that Karl Popper took it out with Marxism in the 1950’s. Existentialism isn’t even that. It’s another example of Eric Raymond’s "Gramscian Damage”: .

Right. And nothing is new. I cite *novel* stuff in every occurrence, outlining actual human *progress*, and you go all relativistic and say they’re derivative. Fine. Derivative of what, exactly? What was the Roman lateen sail derivative of if there had not been a triangular sail before, for instance.
What is Zeno’s paradox, say, derivative of? The Pythagorean theorem? Hero’s steam turbine?
There *is* an arrow to progress. It is measurable. The arrow of islamic culture points in completely the opposite direction. The left’s anti-western urge to annihilate progress, and thus humanity, is striking in its tenacity.
It is evil.

Information that is only valuable because of book-entry transaction settlement, by the way. Like, say, (for the current generation of ancom cypherpunks, who don’t know commerce from the dictatorship of the proletariat) checks, credit cards, and, yes, bitcoin. The blockchain is merely :-) a cryptographically secure inviolate public ledger, remember. It may be possible to hide transactions there, but I wouldn’t bet my life on it.
Because we *need* biometricly-provable is-a-physical-person and-then-you-go-to-jail-if-you-lie identity in order for transactions to even execute, much clear and settle, we’ve created an entire industry based on the leftover information exhaust, dovetailing nicely with our former practice of massive industrial production runs of exactly identical goods, and thus the transfer-pricing of ostensibly marketable (as in free exchange, not as in advertising) assets, now migrated to the internet with a vengeance, to be used as evidence against us in a court of law, Arlo.
Instantaneously-settled transactions, like, say, with blind signatures, which, not coincidentally, required no counterparty identity to function, only a linked list of expired certificates, only readable at the time of double spending, is why I joined the original cypherpunks list to begin with. In 1994. We’ve been at this a long time. At the time, I had digital good that I could email to someone, like say, Oak Ridge Labs, but they could only send me a paper purchase order by return mail. Which I then had to reply to that purchase order, by mail, with a paper invoice, which they would then send me a paper check, also in the mail, which would then clear. Within five business days. Usually.
So now we’re learning, in increasingly intimate detail, something I first observed in public at the last Financial Cryptography Conference I went to, almost ten years ago: the closer you get to T-0 transaction settlement you get, the more dangerous identity-based finance becomes.
And that’s also why I still say that financial cryptography is the only cryptography that matters.

The Register
GNU cryptocurrency aims at 'the mainstream economy not the black market'
GNU and an outfit called âInriaâ have released Alpha code â version 0.0.0 to be precise â of an anonymous-but-taxable electronic payments system they say is âa currency for the mainstream economy, and not the black market.â
âTalerâ, as the effort is dubbed, looks to be an attempt to build on the concepts behind Bitcoin. So while Taler lets you use encrypted âcoinsâ as a means of exchange, it is explicitly not a new currency. Instead, it â... uses an electronic exchange holding financial reserves in existing currencies.â
âThis means that Taler is not a new currency with the inherent currency fluctuation risks, but instead the cryptographic coins correspond to existing currencies, such as US Dollars, Euros or even BitCoins.â
The technology is also designed to be open enough that governments can peer inside, levy âsales, value-added or income taxesâ.
As a GNU project, the code is of course freely-available.
For now, the effort is in its very early stages. GNU even warns, in the announcement of the project's debut, that âThere is no auditor, and hence components do not properly support auditors either. As a result, a dishonest exchange could embezzle funds.â There's also no real-world integration at present, âso only toy currencies are available for now.â
If you're interested regardless of those foibles, the 0.0.0 code does include âkey components providing logic for running a bank, exchange, merchant and wallet.â That code is described as follows:
Inria and GNU hope to have more advanced versions of Taler to share by year's end.
When they do, it may well be game on in the cryptocurrency space: Taler's already used fighting words with its âmainstream, not black marketâ talk. Bitcoin's many admirers may take offence at that kind of language and point to strong adoption. Sceptics can point to security woes among Bitcoin exchanges, governance woes and the cryptocurrency's volatility as evidence that different approaches to electronic currencies probably won't hurt their evolution.

Depends on if you’re a Marxist and think that money steals power, or an anarchist and thinks that power steals money. The latter grabs the market-elephant blindly, the former sucks giant donkey dicks in the Tijuana Donkey show of force, fraud, and plunder.
As an example of what Peter might have been alluding to, Pompey and Julius were rich Roman guys who got richer in the conquering trade, Pompey going east after pirates and then eastern kings, and Julius going after, well, Gaul, actually. And then, you know, Rome, after that.
But, like I said, it’s older than that. Since people started staying in one place in middle Anatolia about 12-18,000 years ago, about five thousand years before they actually started cultivating the wheat they were harvesting every year and moving out from there down the Tigris and Euphrates and Nile and out into Fair Europa, all farmers -- and then mechanics -- since have been subject to the depredations of former hunter-gatherers who plundered them for their “surplus” assets. And priestly former scavengers who told them lies of pie in the sky when they die to justify the actions of the guys who, you know, beat the fuck out of you if you didn’t pay up.
Because, like dogs, and hyenas, they could.
Now the priests are academics, the media, and legislative politicians. The Hunter/gatherers are either professional military (mostly harmless…) or plundering proto-warlord aristocrats like, come to think of it, all four current extant presidential hopefuls, and the current occupant of Adams’ Edifice. There. How’s that?
