Fraud Feared as Antigua Net Bank Fails By EMILE VALERE c.1997 Bloomberg News T. JOHN'S, Antigua - The Antigua and Barbuda government issued a fraud
alert Tuesday after the collapse of European Union Bank and the
disappearance of
its cofounders. The locally-chartered bank, which fired all its employees last Thursday,
marketed itself as the first off-shore bank on the Internet. The Antiguan government hired the accounting firm Coopers and Lybrand
LLP to
examine the records of the three-year-old company. Callers to the bank heard a recorded message that gave only a hint that
was amiss. ``Welcome. You have reached the European Union Bank,`` said a
reassuring-sounding male voice. ``Due to technical reasons, some of our
involving the security mode are temporarily unavailable.'' The bank's Internet site,  , was also unavailable. Meanwhile, the government is on the look-out for the bank's founders,
Ushakov, allegedly of Bronxville, New York, and Vietalui Papsouev of
Hill, Ontario, according to the Caribbean News Agency. The government
says the
two are Russian nationals. The Idaho Department of Finance on May 30 ordered European Union to stop
soliciting deposits from Idaho residents over the Internet. ``I can't say I'm surprised'' at the news of the bank's collapse, said
Gavin Gee,
director of the department. Idaho alleged the bank, without a state or federal charter, was
operating illegally.
Gee said he hopes other U.S. regulators will take similar actions
against off-shore
banks soliciting over the Internet. ``If nobody's going to take action against fraud on the Internet, we've
got a serious
problem,'' said Gee. Antigua has more than 50 off-shore banks. Prime Minister Lester Bird
February targeted three of them to be shut down because of their alleged
involvement with Russian crime rings. The Associated Press reported last week that the Bank of England warned
investors last fall about depositing funds in European Union Bank. (The Bloomberg web site is at  )< (Disbributed by The N.Y. Times News Service)< NYT-08-06-97 1054EDT<

FBI wants domestic crypto keys By Alex Lash
July 10, 1997, 12:45 p.m. PT After months on the fence, Federal Bureau of Investigation
director Louis Freeh is making it clear that controlling the
domestic use of encryption software is a greater priority than
limiting its export. "Law enforcement is more concerned about the significant and
growing threat to public safety and effective law enforcement
that would be caused by the proliferation and use within the
United States of a communications infrastructure that
supports strong encryption products but cannot support timely
law enforcement decryption," Freeh told the Senate Judiciary
Committee yesterday. The director's comments yesterday underline the conflict
within the administration on encryption policy and the
influence the security agencies have on that policy. Other
voices in the administration, including Vice President Al Gore
and an early draft of the White House's e-commerce white
paper, have long insisted that domestic use would remain
unregulated. In the hearing convened by committee chairman Orrin Hatch
(R-Utah), Freeh also expressed concern that pending Senate
legislation doesn't go far enough in giving law enforcement
access to encrypted electronic data within U.S. borders. "These legislative proposals still do not contain adequate
assurances that the impact on public safety and effective law
enforcement of the widespread availability of encryption will
be addressed," he told the committee. Freeh was referring specifically to Senate bill 909, which
mandates domestic key recovery--a technology that gives
access to a user's private keys--for all encryption products
purchased with federal money and for all federally funded
electronic networks. Security officials like Freeh argue that
inaccessible encryption will let criminals communicate on the
Internet without fear of being caught. The bill, sponsored by Sens. Bob Kerrey (D-Nebraska) and
John McCain (R-Arizona), would also require key recovery
for anyone within the United States using a
government-approved digital certificate. Digital certificates
are ID tags that verify the sender of a communication or
transaction as well as the integrity of the data within. "Registration and the use of registered agents and [digital
certificate] authorities are entirely voluntary," Kerrey told the
committee yesterday. Because digital certificates are considered necessary to spur
Net-based commerce, critics of the McCain-Kerrey bill argue
that a federal "stamp of approval" program for certificates
creates an environment of mistrust for those who choose not
to participate in the program. Such an environment is bad for
business, critics say, and will make the federal program and
the use of key recovery a de facto standard. The bill has already been approved by the Senate Commerce
Committee, and Judiciary might take it up for debate soon. The
bill has not yet been referred to the committee, however, and
no further hearings have been scheduled, according to the
committee press secretary Jeanne Lopatto. Opponents of McCain-Kerrey are already taking
unprecedented steps to state their case. The Electronic
Frontier Foundation, an online rights organization, has gone
beyond its usual Net-based advocacy to create a 60-second
radio spot. The commercial urges listeners to contact McCain
and complain about the bill. "We feel that if this bill passes it will have an extreme impact
to privacy for the American public in the next 100 years, and
the majority of people walking down the street will never
know what even happened," EFF executive director Lori Fena
told CNET's NEWS.COM. "We're preaching to the choir
already on the Net; it's more effective to reach people in their
cars." The radio ad is airing this week during rush-hour drive times
in San Francisco, New York, and Washington, D.C. The
organization will gauge the volume of response to the ad
before buying more air time, but Fena is encouraged by the
response so far. The nonprofit group has spent "in the low
thousands of dollars" on the advertisements, Fena added.

Airlines to start profiling, bag matching
New security measures for domestic flights, combining limited bag
matching with a controversial computerized profiling system, will be
operating by Dec. 31, Federal
Aviation Administration officials said Wednesday. But the proposal, scaled down from what a presidential commission
recommended in September, immediately drew fire from airline safety and
civil rights proponents. The FAA will require that "first, passengers are profiled and selected
bags are searched or matched," said Bruce Butterworth, director of civil
aviation security
operations, in an interview with USA TODAY. Airlines are expected to match bags with about 5% of fliers. A
computerized profiling system will identify those who might pose a
security risk. Example: passengers
who buy tickets with cash. If someone matches the profile, their bags would not be stowed until
they actually board the plane. Total bag matching is routine on international flights. But American Airlines executive vice president Robert Baker says he
doubts that the Dec. 31 deadline will be met because airlines are still
developing a profiling
system. "We'll be lucky to have this in place by next year," he says. The FAA says it was encouraged that a test of bag matching in May at 12
U.S. airports didn't cause massive delays. Proponents of 100% bag
matching say the FAA
caved into the airlines' demands. "This weakens the whole idea of bag matching. It's about time the FAA
decides whether it's on the side of profits for the airlines or on the
side of safety," says
Susan Cohen, whose daughter was killed by the terrorist bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103 in 1988. The presidential commission had proposed that every passenger be matched
with every bag on all domestic flights. But after the airlines objected, fearing massive delays, it agreed to a
combination of profiling and limited matching. Others say profiling may discriminate against some ethnic groups.
"Passengers should not have to give up essential liberties just to get
on planes," says the ACLU's
Gregory Nojeim. By Donna Rosato, USA TODAY

McCain Open to Key Recovery Alternative
by Rebecca Vesely 3:06pm  11.Jul.97.PDT Senator John McCain, sponsor of legislation that
would create a domestic key recovery system for all encrypted

he is open to hearing alternatives to such a plan. "We are not wedded entirely to key recovery," the Arizona Republican

Making Imaginary Sex Illegal
by Ashley Craddock 12:05pm  14.Jul.97.PDT Is there such a thing as child porn which doesn't
involve children? Logic would say no, but adherence to the rules of
reason has never been a hallmark of the United States Congress,
particularly when it comes to hot-button issues like child protection. So maybe it shouldn't be surprising that Congress has made it a
criminal offense to depict non-obscene, sexually explicit material
involving anyone who "appears to be" a minor. Maybe it shouldn't be
surprising that it made it a criminal offense to advertise materials in
any way that "conveys the impression" that minors will be sexually
depicted. But what about the fact that Congress explicitly designed the law to
make computer-simulated child porn illegal? "Besides the completely unconstitutional prohibition on using young
adult actors, we're basically talking about criminalizing
pseudo-pornography," says William Bennett Turner, a San Francisco
First Amendment specialist. "I laughed when I first read that Congress
was trying to make imaginary sex illegal. I never thought the law
would pass." But in a climate in which the US president can seriously tout the myth
that fashion photography kicked off a heroin craze among teenagers
jonesing to jump on the fastest, hippest bandwagon, the Child
Pornography Protection Act was a sure shot. And at the end of 1996,
the law quietly made it a felony to engineer, sell, or even posses
computer-simulated images of smutty kids, or sexually explicit
depictions of real baby-faced adults. The rationale behind the Child Porn Act, introduced by Senator Orrin
Hatch (R-Utah), is by and large unoriginal: Pedophiles can use child
pornography - or anything that looks like child porn - to seduce kids.
Moreover, child porn, whether it depicts real kids, childlike adults, or
computer simulations of kids, makes pedophiles a little too hot and
bothered for society's good. But the age of morphing added a new twist
to the old arguments. When perverts can whip up sexual turn-ons
from composites of photographs of children or even from computer
graphics programs, argued supporters, a new child-porn definition is
crucial. Whether those computer-age fears have any more basis in reality than
your average monster-in-the-closet didn't seem to matter one whit
to Congress. Testimony that the Department of Justice had "not come
across any pedophiles who have actually used the morphing technology"
didn't slow the bill's passage. Neither did testimony by another
witness, Jeffrey Dupilka of the US Postal Service, who voiced his
official opinion that pedophiles "probably" knew about morphing
technologies, and were "most likely" using them, but that he didn't
"know for sure." No more concrete evidence made its way into Congress
before the bill passed. Now, anyone in possession of child pornography could face up to five
years in prison - more if they're repeat offenders. Producers and
distributors could face up to 30 years in jail for repeat offenses. Alarmed by the Child Porn Act's ramifications for films that cast
young actors as sexually active kids (before your favorite porn flick,
think Lolita or Romeo and Juliet) the adult entertainment industry
responded almost immediately. In January, the Free Speech Coalition
filed a brief against Attorney General Janet Reno, contending that the
government had far overstepped the First Amendment. The acting judge decided against a trial. Both parties, he announced,
could file briefs in support of their position. So on Friday, the
filed their arguments in the United States District Court in San
Francisco. As the case has evolved, the government has moved toward the stance
that it didn't really mean to outlaw sexually explicit images of young
adults who might look like kids. What it meant to do was protect the
world from explicit kiddie morphs. It's a ridiculous position, argues Turner. So along with the American
Civil Liberties Union, last week he filed an amicus brief in support of
Free Speech Coalition's suit. "There is a real difference between
touching children sexually and touching computer keys to create
images: the former is wrong in itself and within the power of
government to prohibit; but there is nothing inherently wrongful
about using either a computer or adults to create sexually explicit
images," the document contends. The court is scheduled to hear oral arguments from both sides 8

National Security Agency markets commercial ASICs
By Loring Wirbel
SNOWMASS, Colo. -- On a scale unprecedented for a government
intelligence arm, the National Security Agency (NSA) is expanding its
selling of
ASICs and design services, even offering commercial semiconductor
designs for selected space-based and terrestrial applications. Terry Brown, NSA deputy chief of microelectronics, said the customer
list will still be so specialized that the agency won't compete directly
developers of military ASICs and rad-hard devices. "Any customer of ours
would still require a government sponsor at some level," he said. Nevertheless, at an IEEE conference held recently, representatives of
Harris Semiconductor and UTMC Microelectronic Systems wondered how and
why a secret government agency would compete against them. One representative of a commercial IC house, who asked not to be
identified, said, "Whenever the government thinks it can sell products
to OEMs, it
inherently raises some problems." The commercial efforts involve NSA's 6-inch CMOS fab, run by National
Semiconductor Corp., at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Md., and a
Microelectronics Research Lab run by NSA at an undisclosed Maryland
location. The agency has developed special ASICs for selected customers
ever since National helped open the fab in the late 1980s. Some, such as
the Mykotronx division of Rainbow Technologies Inc., were partners in
crypto chips, while others sought NSA expertise in radiation-hardness
for space applications. Looking to expand that customer base, the agency has named Leland Miller
its first director of marketing for microelectronics. At the IEEE
and Space Radiation Effects Conference, NSA had a large trade booth
advertising the capabilities of "NSA Microelectronics." Brown said NSA has special talent in data-path design, used in signal
and image processing but ignored by many ASIC vendors. NSA's fab has a library of more than 100 standard cells, optimized for
CMOS feature sizes from 0.5 to 1.2 microns. The fab handles double- and
triple-metal designs and is just beginning to add non-volatile EPROM and
E2PROM cell capabilities.

          McVeigh verdicts Monday afternoon, posting that the Oklahoma City
          bombing defendant was guilty approximately an hour before the
          jurors had made their verdicts known in a Denver courtroom.
          Spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said the error was a "technical glitch"
          caused by a misunderstanding about servers used on the site,
          which launched just last month. ABCNews.com uses a staging server
          to hold the prepared news before posting it live, but executives
          were unaware that the ticker function uploads information live

          "We've never done the ticker updating this way," said Murphy.
          Both headlines - "McVeigh Not Guilty" and "McVeigh Guilty" - ran
          for an undetermined amount of time. "It was not up for very
          long," assured Murphy. "Someone noticed immediately and ...
          deleted it from the ticker."
          It's common practice for news organizations to prepare alternate

          to get the news out as quickly as possible. But this isn't the
          first time an online news operation has had problems with a

Crypto foes have day in court By Alex Lash
June 18, 1997, 5:45 p.m. PT SAN FRANCISCO--Both sides of a landmark court battle
over the use of encryption made their final arguments here
today before a federal judge, who now will decide if the
government's restrictions on encryption exports go too far. The case focuses on Daniel Bernstein, a University of Illinois
math professor who sued the government two years ago as a
graduate student when he was not allowed to publish his
Snuffle encryption program on the Internet without an export
license. But the case extends to the all Internet users, who
are coming to rely more on privacy and security for electronic
correspondence and transactions. Strong encryption is
considered necessary to provide that security. On the other hand, law enforcement officials are worried that
the unchecked spread of strong encryption will make
communications by criminals impossible to track and decode. U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Patel has already proven
sympathetic to Bernstein's case. In April 1996, she ruled that
software code is free speech and therefore protected under the
First Amendment. From that, she said in December that the
government's regulations created unconstitutional "prior
restraint" of free expression, meaning the creation of an
atmosphere that made the free exchange of protected ideas
difficult, if not impossible. Patel can now take as much time as she wants to hand down
her decision. She must decide if the government regulations
violate constitutional or statutory standards. The judge must
also decide what type of relief to grant Bernstein and if that
relief--in the form of unimpeded export of encryption
software--should extend to everyone. Since her December ruling, the federal export rules have been
switched from the auspices of the State Department to the
Commerce Department's Bureau of Export Administration.
Patel called the lead attorneys for Bernstein and for the
government together today to determine if she should
reconsider her December ruling in light of the shift. "We think [the issues] are fundamentally the same," Cindy
Cohn, lead attorney for Professor Bernstein, told the judge.
"All the things you found wrong before are still up in the air." Government attorney Anthony Coppolino essentially agreed,
although he claimed the new rules, which were mandated by a
presidential executive order, cleared up some of the confusion
caused by the State Department rules. "The president's order
of transfer made clearer that we want to control the encryption
function, not the ideas," he said. Despite Judge Patel's differing perspective, Coppolino
maintained that the government's rules, which require
publishers of strong encryption software to apply for a
government license, were aimed at controlling the unimpeded
spread of "easy-to-access, easy-to-use" encryption but not
the spread of intellectual expression. Coppolino nonetheless seemed resigned to yet another
"adversarial" decision, as he called Patel's previous rulings,
and argued that if the judge rules in favor of
Bernstein--which seems likely given her remarks
today--her interpretation should be as narrow as possible.
Coppolino said that a national injunction on the regulations
would be overkill. "You can clearly fashion relief [for Bernstein] without
throwing it open on a nationwide basis," Coppolino contended.
Cohn, who has argued the case pro bono with the help of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, countered that Bernstein's job
requires not just his own free expression but free
communication in general. "We think that everyone else should be protected," she
argued to Patel. "There's no way that Bernstein can speak
freely if no one else can speak back." The encryption battle is also being fought in Congress, where
several bills aim to strike down the same federal export rules
that Bernstein is challenging, while one bill, sponsored by
Senators John McCain (R-Arizona) and Bob Kerrey
(D-Nebraska), seeks to impose domestic controls for the
first time.
Introduced yesterday in the Senate, McCain-Kerrey seeks to
mandate the use of key recovery--a system that allows law
enforcement officials to intercept and decode encrypted
electronic communications--for all government products and
government-funded networks. It also aims to tie the domestic
use of digital certificates--a type of electronic ID card that
verifies the legitimacy of an electronic transmission--to key
Under the plan, users will not be able to obtain a digital
certificate from a government-licensed "certificate authority"
unless they make their private encryption keys available to
law enforcement when necessary.

The fix is in...
New crypto bill clears committee By Alex Lash
June 19, 1997, 11 a.m. PT just in Just two days after it was introduced, a bill that seeks
to impose restrictions on the domestic use of encryption sailed
without hearings through the Senate Commerce Committee. The bill, sponsored by Commerce Committee chairman John
McCain (R-Arizona) and Bob Kerrey (D-Nebraska),
originally was a proposal floated by the White House as an
alternative to other bills that aim to lift most restrictions on
the use and export of encryption software. The Commerce
Committee passed the bill on a voice vote. Unless it is
diverted to another committee, the bill will be scheduled for a
full Senate vote. Privacy advocates viewed the success of the McCain-Kerrey
bill, known formally as the Secure Public Networks Act of
1997, with great concern. "This is majorly bad news," David Sobel, legal counsel for the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, said today. "It basically
mandates use of key recovery encryption in any federally
supported network, including universities. It also muddies the
waters for the prospects of liberalizing encryption policy, and
it's directly at odds with the SAFE bill that is moving through
the House." Both the SAFE bill in the House and the Pro-Code bill in the
Senate seek to ban federally mandated key recovery.
Pro-Code had early success after its reintroduction this year
but has stalled in the same committee that just passed the
McCain-Kerrey bill. Like the White House proposal, the McCain-Kerrey bill
seeks to impose for the first time mandatory key recovery
within the United States on top of the White House's crypto
export regulations.
Despite implementing tight domestic controls on encryption,
the bill leaves open a window for looser export controls. It
gives the Commerce Department secretary leeway to approve
the export of strong encryption software without key recovery
if similar products already or soon will be available.
The bill slams the door, however, on the possibility of
challenging a crypto export denial: "The secretary's decision
on the grounds for the grant or denial of licenses shall not be
subject to judicial review." The struggle over encryption policy has centered on law
enforcement access to private information transmitted
electronically or stored on computers. The government argues
that criminals will use unregulated strong encryption to keep
their plans secret. The use of key recovery requires users of
encryption software, such as secure email programs, to store
their keys in a place where the government can quickly access
them without the users' knowledge. The McCain-Kerrey bill would make key recovery mandatory
for all products purchased by the government and for any
product used on a network that is even partially funded by the
federal government. The bill also states that law enforcement
would require only a subpoena to access private keys,
whereas current federal regulations require a court order.
The new bill would also link digital certificates to key recovery
and grant government the authority to license digital
certificates. These certificates, which establish and verify the
identity of the sender of an encrypted communication, are
considered a critical element of electronic commerce.
However, if McCain-Kerrey becomes law, users won't be
able to obtain a government-approved certificate without
storing their keys with a third party. Current regulations administered by the Commerce
Department allow software makers to export encryption up to
56 bits in strength without a license or key recovery
mechanisms. That limit seems less secure, however, after
yesterday's announcement that thousands of people linked
their computers over the Internet to crack a 56-bit DES code
from RSA Data Security. In a report released last year, a group of leading
cryptographers recommended a minimum key length of 90 bits
to ensure secure communications.

Encryption bill expected to pass House
June 23, 1997
Web posted at: 10:05 p.m. EDT (0205 GMT) WASHINGTON (Reuter) -- Legislation to
relax U.S. export limits on computer-encoding
technology is likely to move ahead in the
House of Representatives this week, despite
a severe setback in the Senate last week. The House International Relations' economic
policy and trade subcommittee will vote on a
bill Tuesday, chairwoman Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, said. Current U.S. law strictly limits export of encryption software, which
information and renders it unreadable without a password or software
"key." Once the realm of spies and generals, encryption has become a critical
technology to safeguard electronic commerce and global communications
the Internet. In the Senate last week, a similar bill to relax encryption-export
controls was
torpedoed when the Senate Commerce Committee approved a substitute which
would only modestly ease export restrictions. It effectively would allow
government to crack encrypted messages in the United States by gaining
to the software keys. The Clinton administration has been a strong proponent of so-called
key-recovery mechanisms, arguing that the proliferation of strong
without key recovery would hamper law-enforcement and national security
agencies' ability to keep tabs on criminals and terrorists. The House bill under consideration relaxes export rules without
requiring key
recovery. With 125 co-sponsors in the House, and "enthusiastic support" from
and civil liberties and privacy advocates, the bill "is expected to be
passed with
limited changes," Ros-Lehtinen added. The bill could face a tougher challenge when considered by the full
Relations Committee. Chairman Benjamin Gilman, Republican of New York,
not a strong supporter of export liberalization, congressional staffers
said. U.S. software companies such as Netscape Communications, and Microsoft
Corp. have been clamoring for relief from encryption export controls. Copyright 1997 Reuters Limited. All rights reserved.

At the end of the article...
While hackers were getting busy, the crypto honchos were
getting dissed in D.C. Apparently, a group of bigwigs,
including Louis Freeh of the FBI, William Crowell of NSA,
Peter Neumann of SRI, and Ray Ozzie of Lotus, flew all the
way out to the nation's capital for a Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing on cryptography, only to be informed 20
minutes before the meeting that it had been canceled.
Grumbling ensued as the various participants stormed back

I what part of the employee base was purged?  Anyone we know?
Sounds like PGP sold their soul to the company store... (or the
corporate binge and purge mentality.)
  [arrow] PGP Pretty Good on Privacy of Layoff Details
          by Kristi Coale
          6:09pm  30.Apr.97.PDT In keeping with its core technology -
          information security - Pretty Good Privacy was tight-lipped about
          the details of the layoffs it announced to employees Tuesday
          morning.
          "We prefer not to mention the number as we are a privacy company,
          but it was small in number and limited in scope," spokesman Mike
          Nelson told Wired News on Wednesday.
          The layoffs are part of what Nelson described as a shift in the
          company's strategy from developing products for protecting
          individual privacy to being a security specialist for the Fortune
          500. Analysts say this rejiggering of priorities is not a drastic
          one, pointing to the 24 March purchase of ZoomIt, a company that
          specialized in corporate, enterprise-wide security systems.
          The shift represents a maturation of a company that built its
          reputation through a type of grass-roots organizing: distributing
          its products through freeware, said Ezra Gottheil, director of
          Internet business strategies in Newton, Massachusetts.
          "They're a real Internet company. They're also an ambitious
          company that sees it's time to move into corporate IS
          departments," Gottheil said.
          Part of that shift may mean that Internet Fast-Forward, an
          ad-filtering technology developed by PrivNet, which PGP acquired
          last November, will take a back seat - perhaps permanently.
          Although PGP wouldn't say that it is pulling the plug on the
          product, Fast-Forward is considered a "lower priority" than other
          developments, Nelson said.
          "Internet Fast-Forward is not as closely related to the tools we
          develop for individuals for privacy," he said. And the fact that
          Fast-Forward filters ads which are an "inimical part of some of
          the emerging Web commerce models ... we don't want to hinder this
          development."
          Nelson wouldn't say whether the layoffs affected anyone in
          PrivNet but noted that the acquisition generated engineering
          talent PGP wanted. That technical know-how along with other
          resources are being focused on centralized corporate security
          systems. In fact, the company has put out a casting call for more
          engineers to satisfy its resource dearth in research and
          development in this area.
          Ultimately, all of these adjustments could simply be PGP's
          preparation to woo the investors it seeks for a public offering.
          Although PGP has no immediate plans to go public, company
          officials intend to review these investment schedules this
          summer, Nelson said.
