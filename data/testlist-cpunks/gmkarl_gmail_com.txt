Hi list,
I was wondering if anybody had any information on public secure spaces
such as shielded rooms.
I would like to index such places, and create motion towards such
security being accessible for all people.

I think that even spaces compromised by only some parties would be
helpful to people who have less security otherwise.  Similarly, so many
people do actually use Tor and other products.
Would constant, public logging, during construction and use, be any
significant help with such concerns?  Sometimes I imagine a space with
both private and publicly logged areas, trade-offs for those with
different needs.
Perhaps an "open-source" approach could help, where any can contribute
concerns or improvements for the next go-around?
