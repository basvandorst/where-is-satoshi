Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 9-Mar-96 Petty Civil Disobedience by
Damaged Justice at yakko.cs That's because of a few possible reasons:
 a) Portions of the CDA are enjoined from being enforced and we have a
legally-binding agreement with the DoJ covering the rest. So the fear of
prosecution is not great.
 b) We expect to win court challenge, so fear of prosecution is not great.
 c) Nobody seriously believes the government will prosecute people using
word "FUCK," so fear of prosecution is not great.
The CDA is overbroad, and must be struck down. But at the same time, the
DoJ initially would use it to go after those who have otherwise
Constitutionally-protected porn publicly-available online. (Obscenity is
already illegal.) I'd be more interested in tracking the actions of
owners of adult web sites and those with explicit sexual images...
Perhaps we should put up our own protest web sites with one or two
explicit sexual images as real civil disobedience?
