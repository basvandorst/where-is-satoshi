You mean, something similar to say, placing them in military units

non-"embedded" reporters die*.
I'd love an example to discuss.
So your assertion is that reporting what a government body is saying is
wrong, and failing to say that they may be saying things that may be
propoganda is wrong.
Are you similarly pissed at Fox? Please share with the group.

Incorrect. I said no such thing, and you're being a twit by attempting
to credit me with such statements. Your repeated attempts to
impute opinions to others that they don't actually hold, really, is
pathetic and boring.
As it stands, you seem only capable of attempting to
impute motives to others that you imagine they might hold, based on
wildy improbable chains of cause and effect in philosophical arguments
and obscure cause and effect based on international relations in the
'60s, bundled together with some sort of New American Century twine
about how if we don't kill all the "ragheads" (your words, not mine),
we'll be enslaved or worse.
As far as your babbling and frothing about how I and many others must be
Saddam supporters, you're just not making any sense, intentionally

I absolutely said no such thing. You are a liar.
Please reference when I said anything about a "poor little vicimized
Saddam", "Terrible mistreatment", or anything even similar. Fact is, you
are full of shit. You are not only full of shit, but you are also
attempting to further your statist goals by attacking people who might
say that you are full of shit.
No matter what I say, you will hear what you will hear. Which reaffirms my general conclusion, which is you're not interesting.
Simple: the people who want to do things like knock over buildings,
should die. That taxpayer funded operations should kill them is silly,
for both the base reason and the effect.
Getting back to what we were talking about, here's a bit that you didn't
want to respond to:

failed to respond". Or perhaps, "James Donald only reponds when he can

Terrorism is stopped at home. (Synonyms abound. Freedom fighters have

"support[ing] Saddam". I do believe you're willfully attempting to twist
other people's words, and not even doing a good job of it. "A equals A" reasoning is for high school. If you look at the words I typed, instead

I have no idea what you've said in other forums. I merely pointed

There is ample evidence that you fail to argue about what people have _actually said_, impute motive and behaviour where there is none, and point to a grand Ellsworth Toohey-ish conspiracy that needs to be fought, improbably enough, by a nation-state.

Yes, as a matter of fact. RTF is an MS format, BTW. They do change it
sometimes, breaking various attempts at interoperability. They don't do
it much; it seems like something they forget to break much of the time.
No, there's no gun to anyone's head. However, as part of negotiating my current contract (I'm a partner in a small software development
company), we recieved lots of MS Word/Excel docs. When you're
negotiating new business, saying "erm, I don't do windows. Can you give
me something else" is a bit of a show stopper. By comparison, if you're
selling someone a car, are you going to stop them mid-sale and ask that
they please haggle in Euros? (And in case you're curious, our project is entirely open source driven.)
For that matter, one can drive without a license.
I see your distinction, however it is very difficult to do business
without MS software. I'm typing this on a Linux-running laptop, which is
my primary user-level machine, and in order to do business, have to run
Crossover. (And I do own my MS Office license.) All of my proposals are
written in plain text and sometimes, done in Postgres when I need
spreadsheet-like behavior. They have to be rendered in Word format for
client consumption. (Open source spreadsheets still suck, in my

directly impact my work choices.
You seem to offload a lot of your choices onto your company.
Just workin' for the man, eh?
Honestly, this is supposition, entirely unsupported by anything other
than my intuition about how companies I've worked for in the past behave. Feel free to ignore. I think they'll lap it up. Along with expensive and annoying licensing
terms, companies get no-forward emails and expiring spreadsheets. Think
about what Enron would have done with that. Hell, I suspect MS
probably evaluated what they did wrong in the antitrust trial in order
to avoid similar outcomes in the future. There's a market there.
Um. Who owns the market in "desktop productivity software"?
I use MS software for interoperability testing (much like I use
Quickbooks, some Oracle wares, etc.), and for client communication.
Everything else in my company is open source. Everything we deploy is
open source, unless the client asks for something else. They typically
pay for that choice, not only because I'm frequently not familiar with
the software they choose, but also because it's a bitch to work with
(anyone else ever have to deal with Adobe Distiller under unix?)
It isn't bullshit that to operate as a business entity, one needs MS
software. I can certainly dick around with my personal website and write
my memoirs without it, and 98% of what I do for a living is MS free,
getting business without it (read aloud as "public interfaces")
is nearly impossible. Perhaps you can ignore that, becuase you're just
working for the man, and it isn't your fault that you write MS Word
DRM is going to be another cost. I'll have to have a real MS box on

do anything but swear at other people in public.

OO even parses some documents well, most of the time. Which is of course
not good enough.

revision tracking, fast save, pass the document around some more, turn
off revision tracking, and then email you the file, It chokes. Hard.

Privacy is something alluded to by the famous "Gentlemen do not read

Secrecy is what other people cannot find out.
Anonymity (strong or not) is vastly important to secrecy.

thought the San Francisco cops were bad, before I moved here. (My

There was a mildly publicized incident in another part of Brooklyn
