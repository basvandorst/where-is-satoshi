Not typically.  The idea that the state has its own identity is obvious,
because it has a name -- the "state".  It is clearly an atomic entity,
in the same sense as a beehive or ant colony (to borrow unapologetically
from R. Dawkins).  However, discussion of the state as an singular
entity that acts to preserve itself is typically delayed until study of
Leviathan.  Then it's expanded when studying Kant's theory of
International Relations.
Those are typically 2nd-year courses, at a minimum.  IR is typically 3rd
or 4th year, but Leviathan is discussed in any number of classes, just
not polysci 101.
