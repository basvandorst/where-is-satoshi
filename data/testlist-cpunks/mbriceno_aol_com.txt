@_subject: mailing list <-> newsgroup ? 
It does come with my regular mail and yes: it is a pain.
   I stopped reading the PGP news group. This Sternlight guy is
monopolizing-and thereby destroying- the discussion. Better stay a mailing

I would be ideal to start our own credit union. We  could make it a haven of
privacy and it would give us a base from which to implement digital cash.
So all you law wizards out there: How much starting capital do we legaly
need? What are the requirements?

@_subject: Source Code NOT available for ViaCrypt PGP 
So we are supposed to trust it sight unseen?
Why in the world would anyone buy an encryption program of questionable
security --which any program for we can not get the source is-- when we can
get a supposedy virtually identical program that we know is secure for free? I can't help but wonder if the guy is feeling other pressures besides time
pressures. Just thinking. I don't think that ViaCrypt will make much money of
the people on this list.

@_subject: Coming Soon:  Commercial version of PGP! 
Have you tried the freeware version of MacPGP yet? It is very easy to use.
The next release (now in beta) will even support AppleEvents. I think it will
be quite a while before you can buy something similar.
[And why would you want to pay if you can get for free?]

@_subject: Examination of ViaCrypt's PGP by members of this group 
A number of posts have proposed that perhaps some of the more astute members
of this list should be allowed by ViaCryp to examine the source of the
commercial PGP. The idea is that if some of the people we are likely to trust
give their O.K. to the code then we can all go out and buy the program
without fear of hidden back doors.
Unfortunately this proposal has the same fundamental flaws that the recent
review of the Clipper chip by Denning et al had.
A group of even the most competent reviewers can overlook some problems in
the code. It may take a long time before a flaw is discovered. The stamp of
approval by some members of this list to a commercial PGP with a secret
source code would therefore be little more than a marketing scheme. It would
be no different from the expert review marketing scheme used to sell us
Clipper, as --I think it was John Gillmore-- has recently explained.

Some mightsay that outlawing all unsupervised communication and activities by
its citizens is-and always will be-a goal of all governments.
Protection from authoritarian eyes is one of the main causes for the ever
increasing use of crypto. Government issued crypto can never satisfy the
peoples desire to find a means that guarantees secure communications.
If the government wants its Clipper scheme to succeed, the government will
have to dramatically limit the availability of good crypto. One of the more
obious methods to accomplish this is to outlaw non-government approved
crypto.

@_subject: The New Mykotronix phones... 
I am glad that someone is finally mentioning this. The parallels are quite
clear. Both small arms and crypto can give  the people protection from
criminals, while at the same time decreasing the citizens need for
If everybody would be armend, we would no longer look at the government as
the sole provider of protectios from violent crimes, rape, or muggings. If
everyone used crypto, we would no longer have to rely on ineffecive laws that
prohibit the reading of someone elses mail or listening to someone elses
phone conversations.
The laws against both eavesdropping and violent crimes do not seem to deter
the perpetrators. Consequently, the helpless citizen demands a steped up
surveilance of potential "criminals," while offering less privacy in return.
Similarily, an individual facing armed criminals on the street often asks for
stronger gun contoll.  The government is all too willing to grant this wish,
since it knows that the unarmed citizen believes that he is unable to exist
without the protection (read: controll) of the government.

armed], and most would say Perhaps my post needed some clarification:
I do not believe that a lawfull governmental police force becomes
unneccessary once we hand every citizen a gun.
Just as the police can not grant an unarmed public's security, an armed
populace alone is no guarantee for safe streets. Only the combination of a
well prepared public working together with a responsible government can make
our lifes truely safe from infringementes by anti-social individuals. I
beleive that if people were allowed to used crypto in all communication and
carry a gun at all times, crime-be it street crime or white collar- would be
reduced to levels far below the present rate.
