@_subject: send mail for more details 
Hmm... I recently discovered that though we have man pages for
procmail installed the executable doesn't seem to be there.
If you read this (instead of just having it processed) could
you direct me to anywhere I could get the source to procmail?

@_subject: Strategies for getting encryption in widespread use QUICKLY 
rarachel at prism.poly.edu (Arsen Ray Arachelian):
Should be reasonably easy to implement depending on at what point.
A drop in replacement for serial.device (most all term programs and BBS's would most likely support this) wouldn't be healthy as at
the handshaking would have to be done unencrypted until a session-key
was established.  Perhaps if the serial.device were written to use
the normal serial.device and except a certain escape sequence that
could be sent to the serial.device as normal output that would
be intercepted as a key of some sort.  Other options include a shared library that an application would have
to look for and use.  (This would of course involve a rewrite of
all the term soft, etc.)  In any case, a sorta standard using pgp to exchange session keys
seems like a good idea.  Something worth noting though, the internet
is a packet network and most bbs via modem just stream things don't they?
I suppose you might have to use a stream cipher or just have the BBS/Term soft wait until you have an IDEA blocks worth, or a certain
time limit then crypt and send.
