Without compressing, and lowering the resolution, the data volume is prohibitive (6GB or more).  That's not to say this compression will yield poor results if done properly.  Most consumer DVD players support the Video CD format (VCD) and many an enhanced format SVCD.  SVCD, a standard from Philips, has a peak data rate of about 2.6Mbps, compared to DVD's 8Mbps.  Feature length movies generally fit on three 80 minute CDs. Audio quality is excellent (Dolby surround is supported).  Subjectively, I think SVCD video quality (if mastered correctly from a DVD) is better than SVHS.  These SVCDs can also be viewed on PCs.
