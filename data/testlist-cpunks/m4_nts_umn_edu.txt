@_subject: Document on Customizing OpenBSD after install 
Is there a checklist someplace on what to do after the install of OpenBSD 2.2?
I'm thinking like:
   1) Go into /etc
   2) crontab -l.		Do you need anything else?
   3) After the first nights security run, change ownerships and permissions on things.
