@_subject: Administrivia: old submission address to cease working 
Oxford University Computing Service have notified me that they intend
to cease forwarding mail sent to the old UKcrypto submission address,
ukcrypto at maillist.ox.ac.uk, as of 31st October. Please check that you
are no longer using that address.
Another request: if you mention UKcrypto on a website, please make
sure you are sending people to the right place! I receive a couple of
subscription requests per day bounced through the Oxford address,
which I currently deal with manually. If you link to UKcrypto, please
link to the URL
or for the archives:
