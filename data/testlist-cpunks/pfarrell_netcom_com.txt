A few years back I was into WORM disks for imaging systems. We needed to be
able to burn an image on the disk, and then go back and set a "logical
deletion" flag so that the records would no
longer be accessible.
The standard WORM device controllers wouldn't let it happen. They insisted
on verifying the checksums on the block. We considered hacking the
controller logic, but gave up as too much of a maintanance headache.
But even WORM medea are rewritable at a low enuff level.

   The GPS system was designed to have two modes, one highly acurate for
military use, and a low accuracy version for commerce. Since initially
no one had receivers, the whole system used military grade for the first
few years.
Before the Gulf war started, the military needed zillions of GPS units, so
they bought commercial marine navigrtion units. After the war, there
was talk of turning on the division, but that was made
impractical with 'differential' calibration.
To get military accuracy, all you have to do is take the commercial GPS to
known places. Such as the surveying marks at the US Naval Acadamy, or
"ground zero" in the Pentagon. Get your "imprecise" reading, calculate the
difference between it at the known value, and use it for subsequent

Last time I looked, the Pentagon was more than 100 meters in diameter.
One of Phil's later posts talks about SA being in a 100 meter range.
Obviously the Coast Guard and FAA want pretty good accuracy.
Whatever the actual numbers on the error terms are, either a moderate high
explosive, or tiny nuke, guided to within 100 meters of the Ground Zero Cafe
will probably take out all of the above ground portions of the Pentagon.
Look at what a single smart bomb (a fairly small one at that) did in the
Pentagon's favorite Gulf War video.
Similarly, just off the Naval Acadamy's grounds is a huge array of naval
communincations gear. It wouldn't take much to put atserious hurt in the
Navy's C-cubed net.
And you could easily use GPS to get close, and then image recognition for
final targeting.
Seems to me that the important concept here is that this is yet another
technology that the government can't control once its out of the bottle.
The scare tactics, and worrisome quotes about "terrorists and drug dealers"
will cause confusion among the masses, but I can't see them having any long

Or even write some code!

I've spent the summer working on a SMTP/POP client that runs under
MS-Windows.  There are two ideas behind it. First, widespread acceptance of
global communication will require that mass market user don't have to learn

local, controlled PC, we can trivially pipe messages in and out of PGP,
RIPEM, or your favorite encryption algorithm. This second part will allow
folks to send all their mail encrypted, which will not only spread the
word, but hurt traffic analysis.
But, I need help. I've got all the front-end stuff working, and can handle
the SMTP/POP protocols. But I can't get Windows to talk reliably with a
raw async link. (I don't want to require SLIP or PPP, as lots of sites
are too clueless to offer it.)

Let me quickly try to clear up some confusion. I've gotten several replies
(real quick response) that are answering a different question.
I'm not trying to reimplement TCP/IP. I'm trying to provide a Windows
version of NUpop, which is a DOS program that works fine over a
simple serial line. Most folks automatically associate SMTP/POP with
TCP/IP, but there is no connection. Admittedly they work better with
a robust, end to end protocol. But I've been using NUpop for a year
over a non-TCP/IP line. I get hundreds of messages a day. It works.
But there are no sources available to NUpop, it is a DOS program,
and it doesn't support piping messages thru PGP/RIPEM/...
I have lots of DOS libraries that do exactly the simple things I need. I
don't want to use DOS, I want native Windows code.

I have no problem with periodic deletion of keys from keyservers. They are

My objection is to anything that makes the key itself invalid over a period

I'm not sure what problem you are trying to solve. Loading the whole public
ring from the servers exceeds my definition of reasonable procesing now.
Since the number of keys keeps growing, I expect that it will never be
SOP to munge all of them. You will get keys directly, or get a few specific
ones on demand.
If you're just trying to save disk space on the keyservers, I'm not all that
sure it is worth the effort. Disks are cheap, and getting cheaper. But
your approach is as good as any. I know there are lots of keys on the
servers that are no longer active -- I collected a few hundred that I
exchanged with Phil K two years ago, and know many are unused starting with
strnlght, the folks at CERT, and Brad Cox's key of that vintage. Even if a

At least this is the text of the hardcopy that I have, and in the

Since it explicitly excludes information service firms, I expect that

===============begin quoted material================
PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
A position statement
Peter J. Denning
DRAFT 1/22/92
To plan for the 21st century, must begin with an understanding
of the current clearing in which we live and work and then
anticipate the emerging clearing.  Our public policy must be
appropriate to the times.
The clearing is a metaphor for the space of assumptions,
agreements, and traditions in which a community of people live
and act.  The name recalls a clearing in a forest: a space among
dense trees with more light and with more freedom of action than
elsewhere in the forest, a space to dwell in and chart a course
to other parts of the forest.  The clearing is not fixed: it
shifts as the inhabitants and other influences change the
environmental conditions.
Starting around 1850, people of many countries looked to their
governments to regulate commerce, erase inequality, and build
societies of better human beings.  For over a hundred years,
many people from peasents to intellectuals had faith that strong
governments would bring them a better life.  This faith was part
of the clearing in which communist governments flourished.
Although the United States took an anticommunist stand, the same
faith fostered a strong government that promised salvation by
great national programs including Social Security, Welfare, Food
Stamps, the War on Poverty, and the Great Society.
This faith is now shattered.  People no longer trust that
Powerful Government can deliver a better life.  The dramatic
collapse of communism in Europe and the Soviet Union illustrates
this, as does the growing disillusionment of the American people
with federal, state, and local governments.  Disillusionment
does not stop people from demanding that government provide
more, but they now have serious doubts that it can or will.
But the poor track record of Powerful Governments is not the
only reason for the shift in the clearing.  Information
technology has accelerated the process.  Communications that
took weeks in the last century now take fractions of a second.
Business success depends on what happens around the globee, not
on local conditions.  Radio, TV, telephone, fax, and now email
are so common worldwide that not even a Powerful Government can
control what information its citizens have.  Because the space
of opportunity for people to engage in transactions has been so
enormously enlarged in the past decade, faith in marketplace
democracies is on the rise worldwide.  Correspondingly, faith in
central management mechanisms is on the decline.
The shift of the clearing brings with it a shift of the power of
institutions.  Government institutions tend to try to hold on to
their power by regulatory coercion to enforce the old ways.
This can produce big tensions which if not alleviated can
produce breakage.
Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in cryptographic
technology.  This technology provides mechanisms for digital
signatures, authentication, electronic money, certificates, and
private communication -- offeringla way for standard business
practices based on paper to be shifted to electronic media.  The
success of workldwide enterprises depends on this shift being
completed rapidly and effectively.  As more people realize this,
the momentum for incorporating cryptographic technology into the
information infrastructure is increasing.
But in the United States, the National Security Agency has been
given the authority to regulate cryptography.  This authority
was granted in another time, in a clearing when the success of
the country depended on the ability of its government to gather
intellegence and to communicate in secret.  These premises made
sense in a world where most of the power resided in
governments.  But the world is changing.  Much economic power is
now accumulating in large, apolitical, transnational
corporations.  These organizations place their own concerns and
strategies ahead of those of the governments of the countries in
which they do business.  Like governments, they are interested
in gathering intellegence about competitors and in conducting
business in private.  Unlike governments, they want open access
to the technologies of authentification, electronic money, digital
signatures, and certificates that will allow them to conduct
business transactions accross the network.
So the old notion of national power and national security are
increased when government has the sole right to gather

Now the strength of the country depends not only on its government
but on its corporations.  The old premises have fallen away in
this new reality, but the old policy remains.  It is time to
rethink that policy before tensions between the threatened

and perhaps breakage.
A new policy aligned with the new clearing would be for the

business of governing.  It should not try.

Back in the days of Mix, Knuth worked out the model. But with modern
pipelined chips with significant on-chip cache, the model becomes
too complex to solve arithmetically.
The usual solution is to use Berkeley's Architect's Work Bench (AWB)
which allows you to model the chip's instruction set, cache structure,
pipeline stall characterists, etc. while using a compiler to
generate actual code to execute. You can then execute your algorithm
against the chip, and declare a winner.
Of course, you have to validate the chip model, and you have to know
how the compiler optimizations work, how it interacts with branch prediction
logic, etc.
While awb is readily available for the usual Unix systems, using it for
anything less trivial than a grad school compiler optimization course is
a ton of work. It makes sense when you are inventing a new chip
architecture, or even a significant revision to an existing chip.
I believe that it is far too much work to use awb (or anything of similar
capabilities) to evaluate algorithms for real world chips.
For algorithm optimization, it makes more sense to study the chip's
characteristics, and use a heuristic approach, testing real implementations.
I've already measured nearly a four to one difference in execution times
using Phil's DES code using different compilers and operating systems
on the same hardware (my 486).
But it is pretty unsatisfying to say that the best algorithm "depends" on
half a dozen variables, and that we can't reliably predict (engineer) a

I strongly agree with both Perry that it is amusing and with Eric

But I see it as more germane than Eric. It is not about
arbitrary self perpetuating bugs from source. It is
about serious security holes that are self perpetuatated
by the binaries of the complier. The compiler ignores
its own source and generates security hacked binaries,
even when the source looks like it is corrected.
One strongly held belief among lots on this list and in the PGP

guarentees security. Thompson's lecture throroughly dispells
that hope, crushing the "guarentee" completely.
Drawing from Thompson, a simple MD5 is not sufficient.

cpu architectures, build the tool from source, and compare the
results. Then, and only then, could you claim that you were

I agree completely with this. we have to move encryption onto the desktop
PCs and Macs, and make it transparent to the naive users. Eudora and NUpop
are a good start, but aren't transparent when you use PGP or ViaPGP.
I've written a non-TCP/IP Windows POP/SMTP client that will work with
commercial providers such as Netcom and Digex, but I can't get the low
level communications code to work - Window's comm.drv API is too flakey for
me to understand and get working.
I believe that my code is less than a week or two from being ready to
distrubute, if I can get some help with the communications code.
I asked a few months ago, and had one volunteer who didn't deliver.

Clearly MIME is a step in the right direction. And clearly MIME is steg
friendly, who can tell a MIME encoded PGP message from a MIME encoded
GIF file without looking at character frequencies, etc. (You _know_ that
I'm going to lie about the MIME-Content-Type flag :-)
But I haven't yet found a Windows PC client that will work without TCP/IP.
Maybe I haven't looked hard enuff.  Since 85% of all computers are shipped
with Windows, "widespread use" means Windows (or Windoze for the cynics).
I also  don't know why the network  vendors charge so much more for SLIP
and/or PPP, but until IP is as cheap as async, there is a need for lower
technology solutions.
There are also some design questions that have to be addressed on the
human interface side. For example, some folks strongly prefered not to
receive encrypted mail, because they didn't work in an PGP friendly
environment. So you need to have a client that is smart enuff to
automatically encrypt to folks who control machines on the net, and not
encrypt by default to folks using unsecure delivery such as netcom.com's
vt100 based users. And you need a nice way to override the default. Clearly
this information goes in the roledex that you keep with your client
software. I mention it only so that folks realize that the simple
publication of a PGP or RIPEM key does not indicate that a user is ready to
receive all email encrypted.
Solving these problems is exactly why we write code.

Most of this could be done with MIME, DHS, DSS, and PEM, if those standards

I personally think stealth PGP is the wrong direction. Widespread, blatent

Yes. there are.
I am motivated from the other end. I can get the client code I need, I can't
get "widespead use" at the server end. For example, GMU, which
nominally provides Internet access to all of its students, refuses to
support SLIP or PPP on any of its servers. No reason, just policy.
I gave up on GMU's services and pay Netcom to give me access. They charge
$2.00 per hour for SLIP/PPP, but all the async access I want is flat rate.
Until the politics and economics change, I believe widespread use will
require a non-IP approach. Sure IP would be better, so would ISDN.
But Eudora and NUpop work fine, over straight async. they just miss the
encryption hook.
I have no interest in debating the value of IP. I am looking for help in
building a non-IP client that can enable encrypted mail to the
great mass of computer owners who are clueless about technology.

Except for tangible money (i.e. 99.99% pure gold coins) I don't see that
any money is anything other than a mutially agreed upon way of moving
"barter tokens" between folks. Sometime the government (or Fed) can define
the true value of the barter tokens, and othertimes their attempts fail.
When the attempt fail, the usual course is to have a "devaluation" that
reflects market realities.
I don't see how digital money is fundamentally different than
private bank notes that were common in the US in the last century. They are
good if they are accepted, and useless if not.
If this is really a critical distinction, since I don't see it, I'd

A while ago some folks talked about being willing to pay for
a hardware random number generator. Not a PRNG, but a real
one. There are lots of uses listed in TCMay's document that
can't be named, but generating blinding factors for digital cash is my favorite.
I've got a friend who is a professional electronics engineer that
is willing to help, but he has some questions on the design.
The Prime Assumption: White noise due to molecular motion is truly random.  Noise generated in a carbon resistor or zener diode is white noise.  Is this true, cryptographically speaking?
The circuit is essentially a "Hiss Generator".  The hiss waveform, after being amplified to the proper
amplitude, would be sent to a rude, crude, inaccurate analog to digital
converter. From there we send it to a serial or parallel port. Probably just grab the LSB, but that is an implementation detail...
We have some design options based upon the Prime Assumption:
1.A a device would use a cheap noisy carbon resistor and a
rude, crude, noisy amplifier to amplify the noise generated by the resistor.  1.B. A zener diode may make a "louder" noise and require a cheaper 1.C How about if we take the hiss that you find between stations on an FM receiver, and digitize them through a PC soundcard? 1.D Another wonderful source of hiss is the telephone when it is off hook.
Is there any solid justification to pick one over the others?
(I expect that 1.C limits our audience too much, but maybe not, esp with VoicePGP coming RSN.)
This clearly needs support, such as  a UART or similar chip would convert the signal to RS-232 to to dangle off of your ports.  Some type of clock would be required to sync the UART, providing a more or less constant baud rate, so the computer can read it.  There needs to be a DC power supply to make this thing go.   This is accessable in the power supply of most PCs.  It is my opinion that nobody wants to put 9 volt batteries in this thing and have to remember to turn it off when they are finished using their computers.   We think that we could  create these beasts for less than $25.00 in some quantity.  The first one would probably cost about $50.00 to produce plus somebody's time (which isn't typically free or this probably would have been done already).
Seriously,  is there really much market out there for this?  Will there be a bigger market in the future as more people get on the "Information Superhighway"?  I get the impression from folks a while ago that real random data is a problem, but nobody wants to spend more than the price of two cases of beer to solve the it. Is the value of random data really that low?
More questions:
2. Do people really want to tie up a serial port with this or should it  contain a switch to cut it in and out as needed and free up the port? This sounds like an A-B switch. 3. Maybe it should go on the PC bus as an adapter card. This would greatly raise the cost, up to maybe $100, but would preserve "valuable" serial ports. Most PCs only have two, and one is used for the mouse, and the other for the modem. Since DOS can't handle more without help, this is a real limit.
4. How secure should the device itself be? Bruce's wonderful _Applied Cryptography_ talks about OS Virtual Memory managers writing out keys to disk without the user/programmer knowing, which is a serious potential problem. We have that same problem with the random number that this device generates. Wose, it wouldn't be hard for a `bad guy' to write a TSR that constantly reads the random port, and records
the numbers in parallel with whatever wants to use it for real. While I'd like to think that I really control my PC, once you get networking TSRs, smartdrv, APSI drivers, CDROM and Soundcard drivers, HIMEM, etc. loaded, do you really _know_ that they are your friends? Is this a real problem?
I can imagine a design for an internal card that allows only one read of the number, so even if a bad guy were there, they would get alternating (and thus different) numbers. I can't imagine doing this off a parallel or serial port. Is there a need for this level of sophistication (and added expense)?
Any comments are greatly appreciated. And if you are seriously interested, let me know, as that will surely add to my motivation.

fourth question is justified. I'd like more backup for this, as
all I have is speculation at this point. I don't know if it is paranoia or
Yes, if you are running DOS/Windows, you can address the world. Sigh.
And lots of other/better OS fix this, but they haven't got the market
penetration. So I'm back to addressing lots of folks, or a few
ones with real computers and real operating systems. I'd rather not
degrade into that religion, I started with TOPS-10 and moved to Tenex...
The problem with the serial port dongles are:
1) while parallel port dongels are known technology, making it work
on a serial port is more problematical.
2) Most PC serial ports are junk. Getting reliable data rates above
2400 baud is non-trivial for low end PCs. If I could claim that the
users had to have 16560AFN uarts, or better, then I could get decent
rates, but then I lose market size.
3) PCs typically don't have a spare serial port.
It is interesting that my mail is so far favoring an internal board
approach. Given that, and the forthcomming Plug-n-Plan spec from
Microsoft/Compaq/Intel/... and the hidious hassles of seting
up IRQs, port addresses, etc. Does this suggest that a
Plug-n-play board would be more attractive?
The key is that they would be more expensive, at least at first. Compaq
probably has the volume that can allow the cost difference to be
offset by lower tech support costs. I haven't got that volume yet.

I'm quite happy about the volume and quality of responses I've

What data generation rate should we aim for?
I guess I should be more precise, given that costs are usually
directly proportional to data rates, what are the minimum,
hoped for, and high end data rates needed?
For example, Tony Patti's RANGER has a very high data rate,
but is big and costs more than two cases of beer.
Is a good bit a second sufficient? 100 b/s? ???
Right now, I've only generated a few of Pr0duct Cypher's magic money
tokens. So if I had a daemon process collecting bits for me in the
background, then 3600 per hour is plenty.
I am sure that when Perry uses digicash for online trading of eurodollars,
he (and his user community) will need orders of magnitude more. But I'd
expect them to be willing to pay at least an order of magnitude more
for the gear too.
I'd like to hear grounded justification for rates, and/or
a rate/dollar tradeoff.
Don't worry about the exact monetary exchange rates. Estimates in
bits per second per case of beer are accurate enuff for this
level of design.
p.s. I just got up to the chapter of Bruce's _Applied Crypto_ that
addresses some of the approaches to this. It really is a FAQ for

Sadly, the state of PC platform SCSI is in turmoil, at least right now.
Microsoft is working hard to convince folks that Enhanced-IDE is the

I don't think you can substantiate your claim that a "great majority of

Worse, MS is pushing hard to push into Windows-for-Workgroups. Many OEMs
no longer ship Windows, even for standalone PCs. They ship W4Wg.
W4Wg's support for SCSI devices is a step or two down from even
W4Wg 3.10. My SCSI disk setup (1.7GB Maxtor) is significantly slower under

I have to admit that PEM's RSN availability against PGP 2.X's 20+ months
of worldwide availability has made me not keep up with PEM and the
latest hierarchical, government controlled certification process...
But is there an intrinsic problem with a PGP-style web of trust for
remote telnet/rlogin applications. I really don't expect to login to
arbitrary nodes on the net, but is that required? or simply a robust way
(SecureID in software?) Maybe PCMCIA cards with PGP once desktop systems
have them.

I use a similar system to Tim's, except that I use NUpop on a "PC" to
download 150+ messages a day from cypherpunks and a bunch of other lists.
We have to move the tools to the user's controlled, secure environment.
For some that may be Unix, but for close to 98% of the 'net community,
a controlled computer is a Mac or PC.  At GMU, a few supported grad students
have personal Suns or other workstations, maybe 50 students out of 22,000.
But nearly all of the students in the techy schools have at least a PC or
mac that is under their personal control. Multi-user Unix solutions
don't cut it.
More importantly, if all 700+ of us on this list used encrpytion for
_every message every day_ it would be only an insignificant portion of the
net volume. We have to get encryption out to the masses.

This is a repeat of a request that I made last fall. I got no real response
then. Perhaps as the list has grown, someone will respond....
I am looking for help on a Microsoft Windows development project. I have
most of a Windows Client SMTP mail client program written, but I can't
devine how to make the Windows Communications API work with any marginal
success. I need help from someone who has written Windows communications
The program is functionally equivalent to NUpop or Eudora. It is designed to
work over dialup asynchronous lines without TCP/IP. Not that I dislike
all the nice functionality tht TCP/IP provides, but because some netowrk
providers (such as George Mason University) refuse to support SLIP/PPP for
political reasons, and because other providers (Netcom for one) charge
orders of magnitude more for SLIP/PPP than for async support.
The resulting product will be user firendly, a native Windows program with
the usual buttons, icons, context sensitive help, etc. It will have PGP, and
maybe RIPEM, support built in. Automagically.
I plan to release the code to the net, and will give full credit in the
About Box, documentation, etc. for any help.
Please respond via email.

there will be a physical Cypherpunks meeting at the EFF's offices in
downtown Washington DC. The meeting title is:
       Cypherpunks distributed meeting
       Politics, Strategies, and Action
The meeting will run in parallel with several other c'punk meetings. If the
technology works, we will have realtime audio feeds from other sites. If
not, we'll call in using speakerphones (bring your long distance credit
card as EFF is _not_ sponsoring us.)
With the Clinton Administration's continued insistance on Clipper and the
current revision of the FBI's Digital Telophony bill, we c'punks "inside the
Beltway" need to get organized.
Please do not bring PCs or floppies. We will be inside EFF's offices, and
should not bring in, nor take out, any hardware or magnetic media. Paper
copies of the MD5 hash of your PGP/ViaCrpyt keys for swapping are fine. We
can use email or the keyservers to exchange the actual keys. Some EFF
staffers are interested in getting signatures for their ViaCrypt keys. So
this will be a good chance to expend the web of trust.
EFF is at the Metro Center stop of the Metro. There is nearby street
parking. The Metro stop is literally inside the building lobby.
Address is 1001 G street, North West. This is the corner of 11th and G.
EFF is in suite 950 East, but the meeting is on the 8th floor.
Coming by the metro, leave the station through the Woodies Deli.
Go though there, and there will be a set of double doors oposite an
escalator. Go though the doors, around a corner and up two escalators.
You should then be in the lobby of the EFF building.
Off the street, We are next door to the Grand Hyatt, which is right
across the street from the Washington Convention Center. Once again,
come in and you should be in the lobby of our building.
We will send folks down on the hour to let you into the EFF's secure space.
Outside of those times, you can set up an appointment, or you will need to
call up to get an EFF staff member to come down and let you in. Call
202-347-5400. ext 224 and ext 205 will probably get answered Saturday.

@_subject: MFC, was [Visual Basic (yes, Basic!), and "VBX" tools 
It is correct that MFC is simply a set of C++ classes, which are included
(and their source) in the Microsoft Visual C++ environments for Windows
and Windows NT. But there are significances to MFC that should be mentioned.
(They are also included in the Samatec [sic] compiler products. Probably
others RSN)
First, MFC (and related parts of MSVC) makes writing Windows applications
orders of magnitude easier than using the old SDK approach. Just as
with the Borland class suite, no one who has used MFC will ever go
back to hand-coding SDK calls, except for the occasional wild hack.
Secondly, and IMHO more importantly, MFC 2.5 makes it easy to write
OLE 2.0 compliant applications. OLE is the foundation of Microsoft's
"component software development" approach (see last month's Byte for a
good overview). OLE is how Microsoft expects folks to hook applications
together in a seemless way. OLE is used currently in Office to make Word,
Excel and Powerpoint interoperate transparently, and its use will grow when
Chicago is released (RSN, I know)
With little work, a programmer should be able to make an OLE server that
allows users to drop Word, Excel, or other documents into an "encryption
server" or write an OLE client that uses the server.
Most of this can also be done with Visual Basic, which is a cool tool.
But Visual C++ is still C, so it makes grabing parts of PGP or PGPTools
and building them into the servers and clients is much more "native"
Thirdly, MFC effectively isolates the programmer from the OS. As a long
time assembly hacker, I wasn't too keen on this. But MFC makes porting
trivial for most Windows and Windows for Workstations (aka NT) apps,
and RSN we are supposed to get MFC for the Macintosh. This will cover
some huge portion of the desktop computing universe. Once you are above
95% of the market, I don't care about arguing the last percent or two.
For those on this list that like to "write code" and speak some C or C++
I strongly recommend looking at Visual C++ and MFC. At $129 for the
"competitive upgrade" it is even pretty cheap.
Please followup off list if you need more info, like recommended
configurations, etc.

Zero crypto content....
The better way is the spontantous order that markets generate. We are too
early in the cycle to have figured out that having a standard 2 by 4
is better than cutting boards to custom sizes for each job.
But some of this is self inflicted by the folks on this list, and other
serious netheads. The vast majority of the world's populations would have
no idea what Tim is ranting about. The last figure I saw had the percentage
of home computers in the US with modems at 14%, but only 4% had accounts
at a service provider of any type.  The folks on this list are on the
leading edge, and are exposed to more of the leading edge, failure prone
experiments. MIME's encryption of ASCII so it is unreadible is just an
example of a false start.
Tim's approach to SLIP/PPP is the solution to the rest of his problems --
wait until there is a compelling reason to change. Let the academics
with time on their hands invent possible standards with incremental
improvements at the cost of incompatibility. Eventually the tiller
will be replaced with a steering wheel, and the brakes and accelerator
controls will be two or three pedals.
Contrary to Tim's claim, ASCII is not the ideal way to read information.
Fixed font, 78 character lines are hard to read. There is a reason that
books are printed using proportional type on lines only two and a half
alphabets wide -- it is easier for our eyes to read and our brains to
comprehend. But studying typography is like studying cryptogrophy,
something that takes time and effort and concentration. Interestingly, the
net is a fairly weak place to learn typography, as it is impossible to see
what is meant by "color" of a page of text unless it is properly typeset,
which requires the fonts, kerning, leading, etc... so get a book :-)

Revisionist history!
CRT's were 80 columns because Hollerith cards were 80 columns. They had
been that size since the late 1800s.
70s compilers for Fortran and Cobol used the columns. Cobol had
A and B margins, Fortran had sequence numbers in columns 1 thru 6, and the
continuation column in 7. The compilers weren't changed just because
of a new fangled I/O device.
In the good old days, there were only two I/O sizes that counted,
80 and 132.

This thread is starting to sound a lot like a religious argument.
Lets try to act like adults and hold off on the "did so" "did not"
arguments. If we have to agree to disagree, fine.
Not to point at eric in the above,  this is in response to one of his
messages, and I don't want to increase the volume on the list by using two.
There is a key point that is missed here. Lets assume you hack majordomo
so that it pipes messages thru a filter to classify signatures.
We get classes like:
   1)     "gold star: its signed" like this message.
   2)     "silver star: signed by an unknown nym"
   3)     "non-follower alert: unsigned message"
   4)     "unverified key, be _very_ careful"
   5)     "bogus alert: fraud! fake signature" (no one we know
           would do that :-)
and whatever else makes sense.
So the hacked majordomo puts in a new header that classifies the
message according to this taxonomy. It mails/forwards the messages to
the thousands of waiting c'punks. Maybe after a delay or two.
I get the message, look at the header, and say, Hmmm.
Has someone hacked the classification?
Maybe we need to have majordomo sign the message/header
so we know that the true c'punk classifier has verified it?
But then we ask, Hmmm, is this a hacked majordomo? After all, no sane
person will read and manually verify the flood of c'punk messages.
So some daemon is doing it all. And daemons can be hacked.
Pretty soon, we end up with cycles and epicycles, worse than medival
planatary motion theory. Not a winner. I don't see a robust solution,
even granting that Eric et al are smart, hardworking, etc.
anyone else see a solution?
Other than dropping this thread, or sending mail to cypherpunks at c2.org,

Then they hand you another form that says you read the stack.

It is definitly a stretch. But a web listing is probably the right idea.
I've already got some public spook information on my subpages, I think
I'll start collecting locations. I'll let someone else do the CGI map.
Nearly everyone knows that CIA has major offices in Roslyn VA. And
most are clued in to the Georgetown (a section of Washington DC)
"garbage garage" that was a CIA front (now it is a tony mall). There are
also CIA offices in Vienna VA, altho I have to admit I don't know exactly
where.  To find CIA offices, all you have to do is follow the blue busses.
DIA is marked, about a mile from the Pentagon.
But this raises a question (please, not to start a f-war)
as to what is a "spook"?  For example, the Secret Service has an unmarked
facility on 22 or 23rd street in NW Washington. They keep the Pres' limo,
etc there. Clearly from a standpoint of their clumsey raids (Pentagon City
2600, etc.) they classify as spooks.
Are contractors such as Mitre, E-Systems, and TRW, who do mega-dollars
of work each year considered spooks? I think some are, as they are
effectively out-sourced civil servants.
I guess I could simply walk into the Soviet Embassy and ask them
where the US spooks are. It isn't a secret from anyone but uninformed
There is at least one Federal Building in each state, holding VA,
Dept of Ag, etc. Nearly all have FBI and other LEA offices.
Is there an ethical question buried here? Making it easy for another nut to
kill mere working stiffs by posting the locations?

I personally believe that this topic does not deserve the heat that it

better idea Tuesday evening when I've had a chance to hear the latest from
NIST on GAK for export.
Much of the complaining in September was that vendors didn't want
to build two versions, one domestic and one for "export"
Netscape is currently doing at least two, and probably closer to
ten if you count Windows 16, 32, Mac, Motif, etc.
Except for Louis Freeh and Dorrthy Denning, I haven't heard real people
support GAK domestically, although Geoff Grevildinger's pitch at the Sept
NIST meeting was 99 & 44/100% domestic. I'll be listening pretty
carefully this Tuesday.
I think we need to save out fury for real statements about making
non-GAK illegal for domestic use. If this starts to condense out
of the Ether, I expect that the civil liberties lobbies will
get real loud. the ACLU and VTW were both vocal at the September
meeting, and EPIC was there, along with folks like Proffessor Hoffman of

Hey, I was a fan of Trial Balloon...
But lets react to reality, not net-rumours.
Nothing to date has indicated that domestic GAK will be manditory,
except, as I noted in the last post, DERD, Freeh, and Grevildinger [sp]
We are failing to get our message accross to the Joe Sixpack's
of the world. We are starting to get get some coverage in
the press (USA Today, NY Times, etc.) but this is a slow
education effort.
Preaching to the choir is pretty pointless.
Don't we agree on this? "tromping" on civil liberties sucks. That is
what I wrote last message.
The policies and technologies are relevant. hacks to disable
Netscape because people are too lazy to see that they are
already doing multiple version, or that others provide
browsers, is noise. IMHO.
If we want to find about the policies, and given that there
is a huge, public meeting in two days, can't we wait to get some facts?
I have not said any such thing. I have attemped to write up actual,
factual recordings of GAK at NIST.
What I am saying is that bitching about Netscape is a waste of list
bandwidth. If you think Netscape is full of fascists, use
another browser. Or, heaven forbid, write code.
What news is there on this topic? I am a privacy guy. GAK sucks.
So what is news?
Is it news that the Crypto-guys think GAK sucks? As TCMay has written,
check the archives. Lets not cover already covered ground.
Come on, lets either talk about news, action (Ian's, RJC's, Daimen's, ...
hacks) or what we can really do to be effective.
My point, which I clearly failed to make, was that Netscape
has to date, done a pretty good job. The quotes from Jim Clark
indicate that his is clueless. Fine, use another browser.
Netscape bombs are not relevant to what I think is the
charter of Cypherpunks.

@_subject: NIST GAK export meeting, short version 
I just got back from the NIST GAK export meeting. This is
a short writeup of a summary. I'll post a longer version later
this evening or early tomorrow morning.
The meeting was hosted by Ed Roback of NIST, who quickly introduced
Mike Nelson of the White House. Mike is clearly a political guy.
His handout says: "We believe that our proposal for exportable 64-bit key
escrow encryption meets these goals [the goals of VP Gore's letter to Rep
Cantwell, July 20, 1994]." He said that the criteria describe a solution,
but not the only solution.  He said it does not preclude other
implementations in the future. He anticipates that the State Department
will issue guidance based upon these criteria in "early 1996," and that
between now and then, any product that meets the criteria will be elegible
for expidited approval. Of course, the existing (slow as molasass) process
will continue.
I asked the first questions from the floor. The two questions were:
(1) Is this meeting concerned solely with export
of software, or does it deal with controling domestic use of strong
cryptography? and (2) since the 64-bit limit was severly criticized at
the Sept meeting, why is it still needed if there is also escrow?
His answer was that there is "no intention to control domestic encryption"
and on the 64-bit issue, that the government is "not certain it will
work." he says they "want to see it implemented and want to see
how it works" because 64-bit encryption is very strong. If the escrow
doesn't work, they don't want a lot of softare to be in widespread use.
He said that they have studied the encryption that is supposed to be widely
available on the Internet. He said that viewed by crypto experts, not
much is very good. He mentioned "two incidents" where Netscape had
weak implimentations. He feels that companies will not trust software
over the 'net. that they "want the US Government to say that 'this is
good enough'."
Clint Brooks, of NSA, then went over the revised criteria. He claimed that
they were surprized at the industry concern over "one product" for
worldwide markets. There were lots of questions. He eventually admitted
that because of the "one product" concern, export regulations will effect
domestic products. [all the more reason for Netscape to keep building ten
or whatever it is.]
Brooks admitted that it is impossible to prevent multiple encryption.
Cypherpunks would do that by using PGP and then sending it using GAK.
He said "as a person, you can set up a secure communication method, and
nothing can be done about it." His concern is not that smart people can
have stronger crypto, but that strong crypto will be easy and widely used.
He said that the 64-bit key limit is not meant to restrict RSA keys to
64-bits, but rather to restrict the session keys that are encrypted using
RSA. Unspoken was the assumption that the 2000 bit RSA secret key would
have to be escrowed.
There were some interesting (and bad IMHO) implications of interoperability.
I'll cover them more in the long version. Basically, they admitted that
the interoperability restrictions made it stupid to have an export
version, you should have a strong domestic version, and an international
version developed offshore for sale to the rest of the world.
They admitted that there can be no controls over export of data, so once
interoperating software is available both domestically and from offshore
sources, there is no value in the export controlled, crippled version.
My favorite policeman, Geoff Greiveldinger, then described the
characteristics of an acceptable key escrow agent. There was a long list
of criteria, all unseen before the meeting. The general reaction
of the audience was that these were "yet another set of criteria that
must be met." Geoff claimed that they were simply trying to address
the questions raised at the earlier meeting about who is an
acceptable escrow agent. One point that caused a lot of concern
was that at least one employee of the escrow agent has to have a SECRET
Industry, with a few exceptions, soundly said that this is a dumb idea,
that there is no market, that the criteria are too hard, etc. Except
Padgett Petersen, representing Lockheed-Martin. He said that LM thought
that the criteria were just peachy. The  usual civil liberties folks
also soundly trashed it.
There was a representative from Netscape. He said that they, as a company
think this is a terrible idea. They oppose it now, and will be issuing
a company policy soon. I didn't catch his name, and couldn't find him
to get the obviously carefully prepared text. If someone from Netscape, are
you listening Jeff W? could get me the text, I'll add it to my writeup.
 ******************
What I think it means:
I believe that the government deeply wants to restrict domestic use of
strong encryption, but they have no legal justification for doing so.
They can't expect that they will get it if they go to Congress. So they
are attempting an end-arround using the export criteria, which they
_do control_. They hope that the pain of having multiple versions will be
so high that no vendor will bother, and all we'll have is crippled
The usual civil liberties lobby folks (CDT, EPIC, etc.) want to
hold their own, industry sponsored meetings to develop workable systems.
I think that the real key is for everyone, worldwide to insist on
both strong crypto and interoperability. The Germans are already
writing fine software and making fast hardware. Microsoft and Netscape
can easily afford to do some of their development offshore. If the products
sell and are deployed, it won't matter what the govies want.
ps. there were a number of other cypherpunks in attendance. I hope
some will add their impressions of the day.

Just a quick note to explain what the govies claimed was the reason for
the SECRET clearence....
They claimed it was needed so that they can serve a court order
that is SECRET. Obviously, if the order is classified, then no one
without clearence can see it -- the existance of the clearence
is classified.
The main area that they claimed was for FISA orders. FISA stands
for something like Foriegn Intellegence Survellance Act. It is
aimed at catching spies.
The whole topic raises a ton of questions, such as traffic
analysis when your _only_ cleared operator has to process
a request. Plus, since you have to be a US citizen to get
a clearence, how can there be approved foriegn escrow agents?
And the usual, why in hell would a competent spy use
crypto escrowed in the US?
I'll put more in the long report.

This covers the criteria, except interoperability.
(To keep TCMay's prediction from becoming true, I'll put this out in parts) This really needs a hypertext media. I'll build one for html page. Please
bear with me on this, pure ASCII mail version.
This is a write-up of stuff I left out of the summary.
I'll merge them together on my nistpage, probably Friday.
You've already seen the short write up.
There is a fair amount of information on the NIST web server. Use url:
< As David Lesher noted, one of the most significant things was obvious in
the parking lot.  Unlike September's meeting, this time it was empty.
Inside the hall, it was obvious that no one came. It was packed in
September, and now, entire rows were empty. I'm bad at guessing numbers,
but its easy  to guess that only 1/3 as many people showed. Maybe less.
The meeting was in general a repeat of September's meeting, and similar
meetings that have been going on for years. Both sides talk past each
other. I think this has degenerated into a parallel with the abortion
debate. There is no common ground.
I assume that the "two incidents" don't count breaking RC4-40.  I can't
remember two Netscape security incidents, unless he means to count RJC's
buffer overflow, all I can remember is Ian's key generation problem.
He stated that they were addressing "not domestic policy, per se, but we
keep wrapping around" because of the 'one product' issue.
The criteria are on the NIST page,
url: They handed out a guide to the changes in the criteria between September
and now. This is available from NIST as url:
Here is a portion of it:
Old Criterion 1.     Moved to Old Criterion 2.     Moved to Old Criterion 3.     Split into  and Old Criterion 5.     Moved to Old Criterion 6.     Moved to Old Criterion 7.     Moved to Old Criterion 8.     Moved to Old Criterion 9.     Deleted.
Old Criterion 10.    Moved to Only in Washington. Oh yeah, they also clarified a lot of the wording.
Ideas that I thought important enough to make notes of concerning the
These criteria do not address either hardware nor non-escrow encryption.
Export controls of these are not changed, they can be exported with the
current procedures.
Brooks said that these rules are not applicable to the protection of
internal data for US corporations, even for overseas locations of US firms.
He said that getting permission to export for _internal corporate use_ is
easy, if it is to protect corporate secrets and for internal communication.
I took this to mean that a multi-national, US-based corporatgon can get a
permit for ViaCrypt and export it for their own use. [later in the day,
some people mentioned that this isn't nearly as easy as Brooks claimed.]
He said that the intent in the new wording is flexibility. They don't want
to prescribe implementation details, he wants industry to invent what
sells. He specifically stated that the meetings were not about setting
standards. This caused at least a fair amount of confusion, probably due to
the fact that NIST used to be called National Bureau of Standards, and NBS
set standards all the time. For example, a couple of folks were interested
in interoperability, say between a Netscape encryption system and one made
by, say, Microsoft. This meeting did not address this level of
about  "The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall be
inoperable until the key(s) is escrowed in accordance with  Brooks said
that the intent was to allow vendors to make a single product that doesn't
activate the key-escrow function if not needed. The idea was that when the
keys are escrowed, the encryption engine would be activated. He also said
that "manufacturers may not want to be in the key escrow business" and
would therefore want to ship products that could be activated by a third
party escrow agent.
While talking about  "3. The product's key escrow cryptographic functions' key(s)
     shall be escrowed with escrow agent(s) certified by the U.S.
     Government, or certified by foreign governments with which
     the U.S. Government has formal agreements consistent with
     U.S. law enforcement and national security requirements."
He stated that this does not preclude the use of "other agents." This
became a major issue throughout the day. Ken Mendelson, staff attorney at
TIS, asked (roughly) "Under what authority does the US Government grant
certification to agents?" The response was a run around. Another hot issue
was whether you can "hold your own keys" rather than using a third party.
Seems that the corporate users are arguing that they want to hold their own
keys, and the government reacted to that favorably (not unfavorably?).
[Later in the day, Geoff Greiveldinger was asked if US citizens have the
right to hold their own keys. Geoff was forced to admit that, "yes, you can
hold your own keys"]
 "5.    The product's key escrow feature shall allow access to the
      key(s) needed to decrypt the product's ciphertext regardless
      of whether the product generated or received the ciphertext."
Contains a significant change that was not discussed in September. It means
that having the key for either end is sufficient. Brooks conceded that this
was a big change, but claimed it was needed. The claim that one-ended
surveillance is easier is most likely true.  It clearly is easier if one
end is US based and using GAK and the other is foreign where there is
respect for civil liberties.
He even claimed that it made the system less intrusive: His argument was
Lets say they are snooping on me.  With one-ended, they can read all of my
messages, to and from, without needing the keys of my correspondents. (lets
pick Geoff G. as an arbitrary correspondent) With two ended, they'd have to
get both my key and Geoff's, and then they could read all of the messages
Geoff gets or sends.
I said it was _their_ argument. Seems to me to be groundless, unless they
got the keys of everyone in the chain, all of the folks that I talk to, all
of the folks that everyone I talk to, etc.
on "7.    The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall use
      an unclassified encryption algorithm with a key length not
      to exceed sixty-four (64) bits."
This is really aimed at session keys, or at least non-RSA keys. I suggested
that they really needed some wording that make it clear.
on "8.    The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall not
      provide the feature of multiple encryption (e.g., triple-
      DES)."
He pointed out that the wording used to say "prevent" and now just says
"not provide".  He acknowledged that "prevent" was impossible.
on "9.    The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall
      interoperate only with key escrow cryptographic functions in
      products that meet these criteria, and shall not
      interoperate with the cryptographic functions of a product
      whose key escrow encryption function has been altered,
      bypassed, disabled, or otherwise rendered inoperative."
Brooks said that this was intended to allow multiple modes, such as
compatibility with other encryption schemes. Of course, he said, the other
modes are subject to export restrictions.
Somewhere in the discussion, Ed Appel took over for Brooks. Appel is
"Director of Counter Intelligence Programs, National Security Council, The
White House" He was introduced as FBI.

Interesting. At the NIST meeting, criteria  deals with decrypting
a conversation with only the key from one end.
I thought that would be hard to implement. But during the discussion,
they called on Miles Smid [sp?] who was obviously a NIST employee/consultant
with real knowledge. He suggested that you could encrypt the
session key with the public key of both parties, and send it along.
This would allow single ended GAK.
This is not far from the idea that CME proposed that the NSA/FBI/CIA
publish public keys, and we'll hack a voluntary version of PGP that
encrypts the session key with the LEA public key -- instant
voluntary Key Escrow.
Miles Smid's idea seemed reasonable, until you realize that he intends
you to escrow your private key...

This covers the notes on agent criteria, and the industry presentations. Part 2 of three hasn't been written, it is supposed to address the issues related to interoperability. I decided it was better to get this part out than to Items on the criteria themselves that I think were under reported in my first reports:
Ed Appel: the LEA�s are very interested in Criteria  (two ended decryption) as they have more than 100 international offices.
Miles Smid described a trick for meeting Criteria  if you encrypt the session key with your own public key, in addition to the key of your destination, and if you have escrowed your private key with an Escrow Agent, then nearly any approach meets criteria    *********
On agent criteria:
   *********
Geoff G. says that the discussions on agent criteria are simply a follow-on to the main criteria The criteria themselves have been spam'd to the list.
They are also available at url:
There was a lot of reactions to the SECRET clearance
requirement, which they claimed was to handle
secure investigations (e.g. FISA). This has already
been discussed on the list, so I'll skip it here.
David Lesher asked a series of questions concerning the requirement that the Key Escrow Entity employ a person with a SECRET clearance. They included: what agency will issue the clearance? Who will authorize for the BI (background investigation)? Who will pay for it? Who does the existing RBOC clearances? Geoff dodged nearly all of them. He acknowledged that "they" will have to pay, but made no effort to define who "they" are.
Geoff said that they may want legislation support for protecting against illegal release of keys, failure to release, etc.
A fair number of the agent criteria would be considered
professional business practice (no single point of
failure, dual locations, etc.) if you thought that
escrowing keys was a good thing.

User/Industry presentations
Bill Sweet of TIS
Bill gave a presentation about his CKE product, and how hard he is working to "find a global solution."
This is actually the same product that Bill talked about in September when he worked for National Semiconductor. It was impressive then (private keys are NOT escrowed, only session keys, etc.) and is still not approved for export.
Bill talked about "information owners," they ultimately decide which security systems get deployed "in spite of various government requirements around the world." He said that "if rational key escrow systems are not offered, or do not adequately protect their information, owners will use unescrowed encryption from whatever sources available (Germany, et al)."
Bill talked about a UK University (Royal Holloway) study on UK/European needs for key escrow. He said that there was a lot of overlap with the NIST criteria, but that there were criteria that were judged as totally unacceptable. The first and loudest finding was:
"the use of the scheme should provide visible benefits to the user."
This begs the obvious question, what visible benefits to the user does GAK bring?
Two other interesting findings in the study were:
- - An entity with a warrant should not be able to   fabricate false evidence."
- - Abuse by either side should be detectable by the   other.
He suggested that these criteria be added to the NIST list of 10.
Bill went on to look at the NIST criteria. He said, concerning Criteria  (agents certified by US Government or reciprocal agreement), that "this is a show stopper!" because:

I appologise to the list for the character mangling in the original posting.
I wrote it in Word so I could spellcheck it, and I couldn't turn OFF the
idiotic smartquotes.  I've placed a cleaned up, fewer typo, and hyperlinked
version out on my NIST page,
It was Geoff G. talking, not Mike Nelson or Ed Appel. The difference
is critical. Mike and Ed have some political savvy. My best friend Geoff
does not. I believe that Geoff has never bought into "voluntary" as
a concept. EPIC successfully FOIA'd papers from the FBI saying that
they will change their tune when/if there isn't sufficient compliance.
Mike and Ed are political enough to know that they can't sell this if
they push too hard. Geoff isn't.
The podium had a light that showed green/yellow/red lights. These
let the speakers know how much time was left. For the morning, since only
NIST/NSA/FBI/... folks talked, they didn't bother to reset the light.
It was red all the time, altho it blinked occasionally.
Ed took the mike, and asked "what is the red light for? Does it glow
red whenever someone from the Government is lying?" It got a good chuckle.
It was probably also close to being true. Ed and Mike understand
the audience, Geoff never will.
It isn't voluntary for export approved software. The word voluntary is
not in the criteria. It is only voluntary if domestic users foolishly
choose to buy GAK'd products. So don't!
Criteria  says "...cryptographic functions shall be inoperable until the
key(s) is escrowed in accordance with Worse, IMHO, is criteria  which states " ... cryptographic functions
shall interoperate only with key escrow cryptographic functions in products
that meet these criteria..."
The interoperability issues stayed muddy. The government didn't spend much
effort making it clearer. The karma seemed to be that if you had two
products, say Webscape 128 and Webscape 64/Gak, selling 128 domestically
and 64/GAK exported, that you can't make Webscape128 interoperate with
64/GAK unless the Webscape128 keys are GAKed.
Part of this is burried in agent criteria  "6. Escrow agent entities that
are certified by the U.S. government shall work with developers of key
escrow encryption products to develop and support a feature that allows the
product to verify to one another that the product's keys have been escrowed
with a U.S.-certified agent."
Looks to me like the software has to chase up the chain of certification
authorities (or escrow authorities if you prefer) before it can work.

This is a vendor with strong crypto implementing Key Escrow for
the only known commercially viable market: data recovery of long
term storage.
In all of the NIST meetings that I've attended, industry says
there is a market for key escrow for data recovery when your
key  programmer "falls in love and moves to a warm water island"
They also say there is no market for key escrow for communication,
we can simply resend lost messages.
Commercial Key Escrow is, by definition, voluntary. You have to pay
to get it escrowed, stored, and returned. CKE is not GAK.
I bet its not exportable.

I helped David get a compiled version of a .DLL, but it was way too
raw to use. Specifically, all we did was make a DLL of all of the code,
exporting all of the subroutines. A usefull .DLL would only publish
the "important" ones, and leave the internals hidden. The selection
of which routines need to be classified as "important" is a bunch of
work. Additionally, I expect that some of the routines would really be
better off with a wrapper that made less of their internals visible.
All quite doable, but a non-trivial effort. I know I'm too busy to

and Nelson's Serial Communications, a C++ developers's Guide.
Since I'd much rather write C++ than C, I prefer Nelson's.
I use ewan as a terminal emulator, got it from cica or wustl, I forget
which. Dunno if sources are availavle.

@_subject: AT&T and VLSI Encryption device 
Today's (1/31) Washington Post has a tiny blurb that AT&T and VLSI will
announce a hardware encryption device for use in lots of
communications devices, including cell phones, PDAs, etc.
Today's Wall Street Journal has a bit more, says that it uses
3-DES and is a market rejection of Clipper. Also contains a quote
from Jim Bidzos of RSA/PKP. But there is little detail. There
was no mention of what PKP technology is used in the hardware.
I assume that AT&T has liscensed DH for session key exchange.
They could be using RSA with the keys embedded in ROM/EEPROM.
Anyone got any technical details?

OK, lets start some traditional politics.
Anyone know what commitee has jurisdiction?
Then the next step is who is on the commitee?
Then which cypherpunks are constituents of the commitee members?
At least some on the list write software for a living, or run ISPs and this
could effect their livelihood. Talk economic impact, not buzzwords
like "freedom" and apple pie.

My cut on why it failed is that lobbying is too hard to do effectivly on a
part time basis, and those attending that the meeting realised it.
On a full time basis, lobbying is expensive, and requires that you raise
tons of money. The EFF found tons of money, and sponsored last year's
Digital Telephony disaster. He who pays the piper names the tune. EFF
got lots of corporate money, and "liked" the 94 DT bill.
So they're gone.
I read this in their actions too.
Cypherpunks write code?
There is nothing vaguely pro-government about much of strong cryptography.
Tim's sig, fall of governments, and all that. Why should they listen to us?
Write code. Send money to EPIC and ACLU, let them lobby.

@_subject: Netscape the Big Win 
I'm not about to argue that the web isn't the hotest thing on the net,
which is the hotest thing in computing... But I've got a question
that I can't resolve.
The current trend is to bundle all types of functionality into huge
monolithic programs. Add mail to netscape, add encryption, add ...
Yet most of the computers people use are multi-windows, and soon most
will even be multi-tasking.
Why are all-in-one programs so preferable to using the windowing
capabilities that are built into every X-window, Mac or Windows system?
Why not use the best mail client, another best webcrawler, and yet another
news reader?
Microsoft has been preaching the use of OLE and component programs as its
development vision for 2+ years, Macs have been popular for ten years,
why is the trend still towards adding every possible bell and whistle
to single programs?
With components, it wouldn't be hard to have a universal
Encryption/Signature module. It would get arround any propriatary
restriction that vendors may or may not try to enforce ("can Netscape be
extended or not" becomes moot).
Is clicking on another icon really too hard?

My small PGP key was created at the National Computer Security Conference
in 1992. About half the attendees were NSA, and lots more were from
assorted defense and civilian agancies. During the free time, I talked
to a bunch of them about Phil's web of trust.
I had a really hard time understanding with where they were comming from,
and they had no clue as to why I thought hierarchical CA chains are
so bad.
I didn't convince anyone. But I have come to understand that if you spend
your entire working life in a job that is structured from the President
on down a heirarchy, you can't imagine any other organizational structure.
This includes the obvious LEAs such as FBI, ATF, all the Defense folks
and sppoks like CIA, DIA, NSA, and the standards "setting"
folks out at NIS&T.

@_subject: Acceptable NIS&T restrictions 
If we can break away from t-shirts as munitions...
I'm going to the NIS&T session this week. I'm trying to figure out
what, if any, part of the process can be made acceptable to
those in favor of bringing US policy into the 90s. I'm not sure
that this is possilbe.
NIS&T published (and it has been reposted to the list and sci.crypt
many times) their goals. Can we make suggestions to any that
are acceptable and realistic?
Here are some of their criteria:
    "Avoiding multiple encryption -- How can the product be
     designed so as to prevent doubling (or tripling, etc.) the
     key space of the algorithm?"
CME has been suggesting DES | TRAN | DES | TRAN | DES
for years. Can they really _avoid_ (i.e. prevent) this?
    "Disabling the key escrow mechanism -- How can products be
     made resistant to alteration that would disable or
     circumvent the key escrow mechanism?  How can the "static
     patch" problem be avoided?  How can this be tested?"
This is easy in hardware. Is it even possible in software?
    "Practical Key Access -- How can mechanisms be designed so
     that repeated involvement of escrow agents is not required
     for decryption for multiple files/messages during the
     specified access period?"
At least this has a chance of being real. We need to have a suggestion
for expiration times for the escrowed keys. This was a huge problem with the
initial Clipper.
Is there a reasonable middle ground between long term keys such
as PGP uses, and the ephemeral keys of a D-H exchange?
    "Certified escrow agents -- Can products be designed so that
     only escrow agents certified by the U.S. government
     (domestic, or under suitable arrangements, foreign) are
     utilized?  What should be the criteria for an acceptable
     U.S. escrow agent?"
We all know that Tim's Flakey Key Escrow Service is most likely not
"an acceptable US escrow agent." But since CKE is a good thing, what
are the characteristics of an acceptable service to us?
I've added the discussion "topics" that NIS&T sent to participants to my
WWW pages if you want to see them all,
But I expect that most of the criteria that I edited out are
unacceptable to most on this list. Without further discussion.

@_subject: Notes from NIS&T Key Escrow Export conference. 
Here are my noted and remembered impressions from Wedensday's NIS&T conference on key escrow (aka GAK) export. Please note that there is a separate conference next week on creating a FIPS PUB standard for key escrow. That standard will be promulgated, just as GOSIP, POSIX and Clipper/Skipjack were promulgated. This export conference was separate from that FIPS standardization process.
I got stuck in a construction traffic jam, and missed the introductory
speaches. Perhaps one of the other c'punks can fill us all in on what I
The first item is that the export criteria will be changed. A small number
of bits will be added to unescrowed crypto, and 64-bit escrow'd (GAK'd)
systems will be allowed. They don't care which algorithm is used, DES, RC4,
blowfish, etc. They care about key length. If it is short enough, it is
The conference seemed to be an attempt to co-opt industry into agreeing
that 64-bit GAK is much better than the current situation. After all,
it would be too strong for a "hacker in France" to break it.
When they opened the floor, there were a few comments/questions
that indicated that not everyone was convinced that this was a good thing.
I pointed out some graduate students don't consider "hacker" a compliment,
and that I thought Damian did a great job breaking RC4-40. I also pointed
out that it was broken again in 31 hours with a "bunch of commercial
systems, Sun and Pentiums" with no need for suaercomputers. I then asked if the criteria were fixed, as setting criteria controls the
result. The NIS&T approved board said that changes to the criteria was part of why the conference was being held.
The next hour and a half was presentation from "industry." Essentially
comments on the proposal. Nearly all of the spokesmen said that the criteria
were flawed. Some said that they already had commercial products
that met most of the real needs of the industry (key recovery) but they
didn't meet the NIS&T/NSA "criteria." Probably the strongest was the
condamnation by Robert Holleyman of the Business Software Alliance.
Hollyman said that BSA represents firms such as Microsoft, Novell, Lotus,
Sybase, SCO, Autodesk, and Intergraph. He said that current policy "directly
threatens" the industry because of "The US Government's continuing refusal
to adopt realistic export control policies." He went on and on.
It was clear that his position is that the proposed policy is a mistake.
After the presentations, there were more questions. I proposed one
additional criteria (based on email that I received from the c'punks):
How do we expire court approved access to encrypted data, so that once the
court orders are over, the LEAs no longer have the ability to decrypt.
The answer was that with clipper, special hardware is needed, and it goes
away when the court order does. I asked how that model worked in a software
only world. There were mumbled statements about adding it as a criteria.
The conference then broke for lunch and breakout groups. The one I was in
discussed criterias 5 and 6 of Topic 3, published in my URL
They are short enought to reproduce here.
5.    The product shall be resistant to any alteration that would
      disable or circumvent the key escrow mechanism, to include
      being designed so that the key escrow mechanism cannot be
      disabled by a static patch, (i.e., the replacement of a
      block of code by a modified block).
6.    The product shall not decrypt messages or files encrypted
      by non-escrowed products, including products whose key
      escrow mechanisms have been altered or disabled.
After I commented that the person writing the notes has the ability to
detirmine what was said, the folks from NSA and NIS&T asked me to take the notes. I love it; but I did try to be objective.
In the middle of this discussion, a government-generated, but anonymnous
paper was distributed. It had "Example Suggested Solutions." It suggeeted
that source code not be available for products suitable for export. It also
suggested other ideas, such as storing a checksum/hash and having the
system "check the cryptographic code several times during its use." There was a strong reaction against these suggestions, not because they were
bad ideas, but because the paper was delivered with no prior publication.
This precluded any planned response to its ideas.
We reworded  to say "want to Trust the Product." This means that it is untampered, works as expected, etc. We then hashed out ways to know this. The list ended up looking like:
1. is available only as object code
2. contains some "hash" function to check for modifications
3. contains some unique hash, with uniqueness based upon something         like "site," "per copy" or "per release" 4. Contains policies against modification, such as liscense language                against decompilation.
5. OS-related security, such as runs "protected mode" instead of as a         wild DOS program.
Of course, the software vendors went wild against "per copy" identifiers,
saying it would add two orders of magnitude worth of problems to The items on the list were not "must have all of these" rather it was
a pick-and-chose menu. We also required that the standard allow
for technical innovation to keep up with the evolving state of the art.
The discussion of  was more lively. We took a long time figuring out what
it said. For instance, could ViaCrypt sell a product that was compatible
with PGP 2.6.2 (non-escrowed) that also worked with the new escrowed
ciphers? It seems to me, and a lot of other folks there, that such a product
would be non-exportable. We simplified the criteria to:
  "right products won't talk to wrong products."
with "right products" meaning those that are exportable, and wrong products
being those that aren't, or are hacked, or ...
We then developed "goals" including:
1. One version for sale worldwide
2. Allow development in the US
3. Domestic Law Enforcement Agencies want Escrowed (I almost wrote GAK :-)
4. Must interoperate with everything
5. Receiver can only decrypt if escrow agencies can decrypt.
This leads to a bunch of issues and observations, including:
a. Can goals 1, 2, and 4 be met simultaneously?
There was a suggestion of a "friendly man-in-the-middle" who would
receive a GAK'd conversation, and strip off the GAK parts, and reencrypt
it, and retransmit it to a non-GAK user. Which leads to:
b. Can we prohibit a friendly MITM?
The big issue was:
c. Startup compatibility. No one will buy products unless they have
sales attractiveness. This means compatibility with existing systems.
Yet the criteria  seems to say that approved products must refuse
backwards compatibility.
This was labeled a "non starter" by the group.
The consensus was that companies can develop a substantial competitive
advantage by developing off-shore and offering both escrowed encryption
and compatibility with existing systems.
There was a discussion of grandfathering in some technologies.
This was to help interoperability. The conversation became fuzzy,
Grandfather technologies included DES, 3-DES, IDEA, and long key RC4.
One key idea was that it may make sense to allow software that encrypts with
escrowed keys, but can also decrypt with any algorithm. This allows the LEA's
to access outgoing messages, while allowing interoperability.
The discussions frequently wandered to discuss the language of the criteria.
The wording was considered simultaneously too subjective  and impractical.
For example, we considered the phrase "tamper resistant" to be preferable to the original "prevent tampering," because it is impossible to absolutly
prevent modification to software.
The issue of interoperability was raised repeatedly. It is critical that exportable products interoperate with other,
existing export products. The last issue in the session was that the length of the key, 64-bits,
was defined in criteria  There was no discussion at the conference on
this criteria. It seems that the NIS&T and NSA folks believe that
this is a closed topic. The folks in the session did not agree. They
felt that 64-bits was not enough.
Once the breakout session was over, the entire conference met together, and the "reporter" from each session reported their comments and findings.
All breakout sessions had suggested changes. The group that discussed
criteria  recommended removing it. The group that discussed criteria  (no multiple encryption) reported that industry was working on a general solution to the problem of key recovery, and that their solution would probably appear as quickly without the government's "help." Several groups identified that there are at least two separate problem domains: communications and data storage. Communications typically is short term, and has unique keys for each session. Data storage has far fewer keys that are used
for long periods. Several speakers suggested that while communications
keys were not suited to be escrowed, there was a large need for
key recovery for data storage. There was no response from the government
representatives to any of these points. One government speaker
did say that there would be a Federal key escrow standard, period.
After the combined session, there were more break-out sessions. In the one
that I attended, the folks from National Semiconductor described their
CAKE system. This is a smartcard/PCMCIA device that uses 2000+ bit public/private key encryption and signatures. They are hoping for export
approval; it is necessary for the project to be viable.  The system looks
pretty interesting, but it too complicated to describe here. In short, random session keys are generated and signed with a Data Recovery Center's
public key. The LEAs could then send encrypted session keys to the DRC, which would decrypt them, and return the unencrypted session keys which
the LEA could then used to decrypt the messages.
While this is a hardware system, its concepts could be transfered to a software implementation.
One obvious problem is that NS' system doesn't meet criteria  (retuiring
repeated involvement of the escrow agent), since it may require
hundreds or thousands of session key decipherments. It also has
a number of attractive features, such as never sending the private
key anywhere, only the session key is escrowed.
The general discussion showed concerns that in the international
community, requiring government escrow may cause lose of valuable data,
as some foriegn governments are not as trustworthy as the US. It was
the consensus that requiring users to have 50 or more escrow centers was
unworkable. Yet this could be required for large multinational companies
working in 50 or more countries, if each required a local key escrow service.
The NS model would allow both date stamping of session keys, and periodic
rekeying. Either would satisfy my "unaccepted" Citeria  technical
limits to the time that a court ordered decryption could be executed.
There was a discussion of changing the criteria so that only the transmission
of data was concerned with escrow. This would simplify the issue of
multinational escrow. We did not resolve whether this would be sufficient
or acceptable.
Today, we will talk about suitable escrow agencies.

This question was asked, it seems like a zillion times, but
probably no more than four or five times.
It is a bit of a belt and suspenders idea. But it also shows how
scared they are about real encryption.
It is clear that this meeting is a shame. Everyone in industry
says it won't be marketable. The Govies say it will be great.
What they really want is to force weak crypto on the US by
forcing the vendors to make a weak product "for export" when
all the vendors say that they have to have _only one_ version.
If they have one version, and it is weak, we are safe from
drug dealers, pedophiles and terrorists.
(BTW, I'm used that phrase yesterday, so it should be in the Federal
register's offical record.)
No, they don't care about the cipher, only the key length,
But with a 64bit, GAK'd key, you can't say much without repeating
the P, and that makes it a TTP or a FTP (two time pad, or four time pad)
which isn't very useful.  You probably can gzip "attack at dawn" to
64 bits, but not much more.

@_subject: NIST notes available 
Thanks to John Young, I have placed the test of the handouts
from Wedensday's and Thursday's meetings on my Nist pages.
url: It is my belief that this meeting was a staged presentation. Nearly every industry representative
said that this was a fatally flawed idea. It was "a non-starter." The government representatives
said that they heard the comments, but insisted on proceeding. The most depressing presentation was Thursday morning, made
by a high level Dept of Justice flack. I'll have to dig out my
notes, his name was Geoff G...
He presented the usual drug dealer, pedophile and terrorist line,
and added corrupt government officials. He pretended to talk about
foriegn bad guys. Nearly all were domestic. He clearly wants
weak GAK so that he can decrypt anything domestically that
he wants.
It is clear to me that the government intends that industry provide crippled encryption "for export"
with the never stated expectation that since industry has repeatedly said that they want only one
version of products, capable of being sold worldwide, that Domestic products will be crippled. It is equally clear from representatives of IBM, Compaq, DEC, Lotus, and others that I talked to, that crypto product development will simply move offshore. Ireland, Israel, and Germany already have significant experience in developing commercial software. It is depressing to hear our Commerce department chasing technology and jobs overseas.
GAK is bad enough. Weak GAK makes me gag.

@_subject: Day 2, nist GAK meeting 
BCc: Thursday's GAK Export meeting started with reports from the prior
afternoon's breakout meetings. I reported on the session I was in,
saying what I posted to the list yesterday (about National Semi's product,
etc.) The other breakout groups reported their problems with the
criteria, again asking that  be dropped, longer, keys, etc.
The presentation for Group "A" was different. It was a speach.
It asked that the process be stopped to let industry develop
market-driven solutions. It was greeted by applause from the
vendors and privacy advocates, with no reaction from the
government representatives.
Randy Williams of Commerce, and Dan Cook of State, described the
current export approval process. Lots of talk of jurisdictions
and types of liscenses. I quickly got lost in the jargon.
The moderator wisecracked that the official language of the session
was English. You couldn't tell from some of the exchanges.
They were questioned on import restrictions. Both Williams and Cook
said that there are no import restrictions into the US. They also
pointed out that Treasury, not State or Commerce, has jurisdiction over
An engineer from Compaq asked a question: He said that his company
buys liscenses to software, and bundles it as "value added" to
their systems. They are interested in bundling in security features.
He asked if his computers would then be subject to export restrictions.
The answer was yes. He asked if he could purchase security software
overseas and import it. The answer was again yes. He asked if
he could install that software on his computers, again yes. And
export the computers, NO. They didn't even seem to think that this
was illogical.
So Commerce, State, and the rest of the government are activly
encouraging the development of competing software industries in
Israel, Germany and other counrties. I hate to think what they'd
do if they tried to hurt US industry.
And interesting tidbit came up after the session. In an offline
conversation, the topic of "personal use export" came up. A
reliable source said that revised regulations are being developed,
and will, be avaialble soon. I explicitly asked if this meant
"PGP on a notebook computer" and was told, Yes, that will be allowed;
with the usual rules that it can't be for export, you can't be attempting
to sell it, etc. Personal use, carry out and carry back. The "source" was
asked if they had read Matt Blaze's personal use disaster story.
The name didn't ring a bell, but the story was well know and considered
a nightmare.
Penny Brummitt of NSA was to talk about Clipper's key escrow agents,
but called in sick. I didn't catch the name of the replacement.
He talked about Clipper's process, not as an example of what will
be required for GAK agents, but as an "existance proof" that some
agents can be found.  The essence was that Clipper escrow facilities are
strong, and staffed with people cleared to the "Secret" level. They also
tosed out the phrase "US Person" in regard to the corporate entity that is
responsible for the contract.
Geoff Greiveldinger, of the US Department of Justice, gave a frequently
inaudible recounting of the evils of strong encryption in the war
on D, P, & T, and also corrupt mayors. He was very personable. He also
sounded like a fascist. Throughout the meeting, all sides tried to
have a civil discussion, even though we disagreed. It was
impossible to stay civil through his drivel. Ruby Ridge and Furman
had been unmentionable up until his speach.
Mr. Greiveldinger said that acceptable escrow agents will be in the US.
This caused considerable concern among vendors trying to sell
in the International market.
Dan Weitzer of CDT (the EFF spinoff) gave a short, rousing speach. It
was a call to arms. He said that since NIS&T was ignoring the
consistant input from industry to stop this silly and stupid GAK, that
we need to immediately contact our congresscritters.
Ken Mendelsen [sic?] of TIS gave a great speach. He suggested that
the critera for escrow agents be the same as the form to export tanks
and other munitions. Then he showed the one page form used by State.
He argued that legislative solutions to the escrow agent approval process
will take too long and kill the effort. I'll try to get copies of his
F.W. Gerbracht, Jr a VP Merril Lynch, represented the Securities Industry
Association. He said that they are willing to work with the government,
but they need long keys, strong ciphers, and international escrow agents.
He used the phrase "unlimited algorithms and keyspace" as a requirement.
They also need buy in from their regulators, and presented a long list
of SEC, CFT, NYSE, NASDealers, and 50 state regulators, all who have
to sign off.
Nanette DiTosto of Bankers Trust gave a short, to the point presentation.
She said that BT has a commercial key escrow service, but that was not
what she wanted to get accross. She said that multinational banks demand
strong encryption and non-US escrow agents. And that they would
settle for nothing less.
A speaker from VTW gave a nice presentation. VTW is something like
voter's telecommunications watch. They have a mailing list, at
listproc at vtw.org. He said that escrow was doomed to failure. That there
is no middle ground. I'll try to get his slides too.
Jack Wack of TECSEC gave a pitch for his shrinkwrapped product. He
said it is exportable now, they've jumped through all the hoops.
He also gave a great crack from his son. It want roughly like:
"Dad, if you own the data before you encrypt it, how come the
government says you don't own it after you encrypt it?"
It brought down the house. (if someone has a more accurate quote, please
let me have a copy).
Professor Hoffman of George Washington gave a great speach. He listed
the Al Gore to Maria Cantwell letter's criteria, as a matrix. He then
filled in the matrix with the Export GAK's criteria. It was painfully
obvious that the NIST/NSA propsal didn't come close. He recommended
that they focus closly on the Gore criteria, and come up with an
approach that meets all the the criteria.
While I planned on staying for the remainder of the meeting, a crisis
came up at my day job. I can't say I was looking forward to more,
a day and a half was enough for me, and I wasn't the only person leaving
early. Attendance was down visibly Thursday relative to the first day

- they are going to promulgate a FIPS PUB standard next week, whether I like

understandable and clear than fuzzy and subject to subective evaluation.

@_subject: Can GAK be made "not interoperable" with PGP? 
The breakout session that I was in was directly charged with this issue.
We talked at length about it. There were NIS&T and NSA folks at the session.
The consensus was that the Government wanted to prevent a version of PGP
that was export enabled (GAK and short keys) that would be backward
The group stated strongly that this was a "non starter." That is,
it was unacceptable. Vendors wanted "sales appeal." That means
compatibility with existing software. And compatibility with existing
export-approved systems. [DES has been exported to "friendly" countries
with strict controls.]
And criteria  specifically outlawed superencryption.
No DES | TRAN | DES | TRAN | DES.
They were serious. talk to CME, he was in that session.
I believe that this criteria is stupid, or at least ill-advised.
But the govies insisted.

I think the "exact" process varies with the journalist. But you have
it generally correct. The press runs on reputations. When a writer
gets a story, they look for "reliable sources" to contact. Reputations
are based on a lot of things, including knowledge, speaking ability, looks
and the ability to emit a sound-bite that is interesting. it is a strange
process. I mean, I even got on CNN during the Morris worm.
Tim is right, there is no "we" here. We can't have an official spokesperson,
we don't agree on much. But we can work from the ground up. There
are a number of serious cryptographers on the list, or at least
friendly to the list when the S/N ratio makes sense.
With a little work, we should be able to find a fairly long list of
media contacts. We can even make it media friendly.
Doug Humphrey of Digex (nice to have a security-related company President)
Bob Stratton of UU.Net (corporate security wiz)
Carl Ellison of TIS (usually on c'punks light and at all DCcp meetings)
probably others at TIS such as Ken Mendelsen or Steve Walker
For the political side, the folks at EFF, CDT, EIPC, etc.
And there are others that could be good contacts, such as
William H Murray of Delloite and Touche,
Matt Blaze of [Bellcore|BellLabs]
It might take a while to get permission for referal, but I expect that
most security consultants would consider being quoted in mainstream
press to be good advertizing.
If we make it easy, anyone would be willing to take advantage of the
resource. We should also inclue a representative sample of folks who
disagree with us. Any real list should include Dorothy Denning and other
supporters. We can simply stack the deck.
We can make sure that the mainline journalists know where to look, and
make sure that CDT, EFF, ACLU, and EPIC have references that are ready when
they are asked for referals.

In message Wed, 24 Jan 1996 00:32:37 -0800,
It is pretty hard, that is one of the reasons the web-o-trust is broken.
You can make it better by requiring the person to actually use
the key, which proves that he/she has the passphrase.
At the last key signing at the DC-area cypherpunks meeting, I told
everyone my name was Boris Badanov. Even tho the key's userid
said pfarrell at netcom.com.
Carl Ellison suggests that the signature should have a much weaker meaning,
roughly: "The person owning the secret key associated with this public
key's tag has characteristic X." Obviously X could be "claims to be Pat"
Thus if Lucky gives me a key, I don't know what his/her real name is,
and don't care. All I have to do is see them actually sign something
I give him/her with the key.  Of course we need to rule out
man-in-the-middle attacks. For me, I would buy off on watching the
signing on a standalone laptop while I watch from accross the room.
Interesting atack: Assume there is a chain of keys, with
Lucky feeding keys to Klaus inside the laptop. I'd be signing
what I thought was Lucky's key, but it was really Klaus'.
Of course "Lucky" would have to have the secret passphrase for both
Lucky's and Klaus' keys.  It isn't clear to me if this is an
important case.
Equally questionable are tricks such as using an IR or wireless
transmitter to send my test data to another computer so that the
chain of MITM can be longer.

@_subject: how much entropy in common answers 
I've been playing arround with some code to implement CME's secret sharing using low entropy answers. (His write-up
is in In the write-up, Carl says " That means that it has very low entropy. For example, a person's first name has only about 8 bits of entropy. Car makes and models have only 2 to 4 bits of entropy -- especially if one is naming cars desirable to a teenager."
Further on, he says "Therefore, if each answer has entropy E, the attacker must correctly guess T=(EK) bits of answers. If T exceeds 90 bits or so, then the user is reasonably secure from answer-guessing attacks." (where K is the number
of questions)
My question is, how do we measure the entropy of each answer so we can
calculate when we've got 90 or so bits.  I know when I was a teenager,
the list of car lust objects was short, and everyone wanted a Mustang or
Camaro, so the entropy of those two choices was much less than half a bit.
A similar idea was mentioned in a critique of the plot of West Side Story.
The question is, on a hot night in Spanish Harlem, what percentage of
women are named "Maria"?
Clearly there are cultural issues involved. The entropy in a question
such as "what is your favorite brother's name?" is low in an Irish
family like mine where names cluster arround choices such as are Patrick,
John, Sean, and Dan.
So how do we measure the entropy objectively?

I was really hoping for some insight into the general problem.
If you knew that my family is Irish, that makes certain names
much more likely. Obviously if you know that I've got five brothers,
a little bit of work will probably let you know that they are Tom, Dick,
Harry, Mike, and John. But that is an example of a terrible question for Carl's
approach. I was asking the more general question.
Carl suggested that in general a first name has about eight bits of entropy.
But knowledge of the social environment can seriously reduce it. Jenifer was
a hugely popular name for girls in the US ten to 20 years ago. You'd
expect more Juan's and Jose's in a Hispanic community, just like you'd expect
the Dan's, Pat's, Mike's, in an Irish community.
I know that the classic definition of entropy is, but without knowledge of
the statistical universe that we're dealing with, how can I measure it?
The probability that a male's first name is Harry is probably pretty low
in general, yet it is exactly 20% if you restrict the world to my brothers.
Carl suggested "What was the name of the first person on whom I had a crush?"
But if 33% of the women are named "Maria" in the local universe, then
that is not much entropy. Yet a name of "Maria McGee" is probably fairly high entropy, as it is an unlikely combination. If you were raised
in a small rural area, there might not be all that many possible
answers to Carl's question.
This is exactly the type of local social bias that I want to measure.
We would expect that an older brother could be a role model, etc. and thus
be more likely to be the "favorite"
How do I know when I've got Carl's 90 bits of entropy?
