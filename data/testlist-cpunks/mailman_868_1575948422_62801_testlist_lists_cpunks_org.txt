   airline to [2]admit sharing passenger records with the government.
   They were proceeded in admissions by [3]Northwest Airlines and
   [4]JetBlue Airways. At the heart of the matter is the implementation
   of the of [5]U.S. Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) use
   of the provisions known as [6]CAPPS II. Some privacy advocates have
   expressed strong dissent with this plan. [7]Some concerns have even
   been brought up in Congress, though for different reasons. The
   Department of Homeland Security has a site entitled [8]CAPPS II: Myths
   and Facts."
