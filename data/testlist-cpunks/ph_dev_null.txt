@_subject: PGP Crack Challenge Ciphertext 
Below is the encrypted text of the "hidejews.asc" file which
must be decrypted in order to meet the "PGP Crack Challenge"
sponsored by Pearl Harbor Computers.
 In order to meet the terms of the contest, the winner must
post the decrypted text to the cypherpunks list, signed with
their secret key.
  Please note that in order to ensure the fairness and integrity
of the "PGP Crack Challenge" that the secret key used to encrypt
the message will be placed in escrow with a Trusted Third Party.
The person chosen for this honor is a respected member of the
cypherpunk list, Alec McCrackin.
