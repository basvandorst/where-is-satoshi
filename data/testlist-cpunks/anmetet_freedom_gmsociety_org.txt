@_subject: Why America Goes To War 
A risk of misreading America By James C. Bennett
UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
NEWS ANALYSIS ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Hainan incident is not likely to lead to war between the United States and China. This is not a conflict that can't be resolved by peaceful means.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½But for the first time in several generations, perhaps, the prerequisites for a war to fully engage the United States are falling into place.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It's clear that the Chinese leaders fundamentally misunderstand the situation. The greatest likelihood of a series of such incidents escalating into war stems from the possibility that the Chinese leaders won't figure it out until too late.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Americans often do not realize how difficult it is for foreigners to understand them. America is not a single, homogenous nation-state on the European model, but a grand union of distinct historic cultural nations, due to the settlement of different parts of the United States from distinct regional cultures of the British Isles.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½These cultural characteristics, though diluted by shifting internal migration in recent decades, have been remarkably persistent over time, both in Britain and in America, as demonstrated by David Hackett Fischer in his book "Albion's Seed." This has many implications, beginning with America's relationship with war itself.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The various cultural nations of America have traditionally had different attitudes toward war. The Southern culture, for example, cherishes a deep sense of personal honor and sensitivity to insult, and actions that step over a certain line require response. Failure to respond demonstrates weakness, inviting further transgression. Anything less is appeasement.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Greater New England model is at heart moralistic. Everyone is assumed to be reasonable, and the first response to aggression is always to be conciliatory, to seek to understand the other side, to find compromise. However, at a certain point, the opposite party may demonstrate signs of being morally lost. At this point, out comes the terrible swift sword, and the army of the Lord goes on the march. Battle is joined fully and mercilessly, and continues until the enemy is utterly crushed. The enemy can be occupied, reformed, reconstructed, and rehabilitated, but not until he has surrendered unconditionally and confessed the wickedness of his ways.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The other main cultural nation is Midland America. Midlanders tend to be fundamentally pragmatic, to divide other nations into "people we can get along with," and "people about whom something must be done." Midlanders would always rather do business with enemy nations than confront them, but after a certain point doing something is cheaper than "getting along."
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Thus America's face to the world varies according to which cultural nation is dominant at the moment. If one cultural nation has decided that war is necessary but the other cultural nations haven't been convinced, there's usually no war.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Sometimes two or more cultural nations decide that war is needed, but the others dissent. This can lead to a war in which Americans participate but the whole nation is not fully engaged.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Mexican War and the War of 1812 are examples; the personal honor of America was perceived at stake, but in each war there was widespread dissent in New England. The Hartford Convention of delegates from Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Vermont considered secession over "Mr. Madison's war" of 1812.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Other wars, such as those in Korea and Vietnam, were started primarily by pragmatists. These, too, failed to fully engage America. Some wars are tolerated so long as they end quickly and the cost is low, such as the Spanish-American and Persian Gulf wars. They were finished quickly, with few casualties, before the national mood soured.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½But when all the cultural nations of America come to the conclusion that war is needed, then war invokes the full engagement of the enormous strength, creativity and will of America. The prime examples are the Civil War and World War II. In both, long periods of drift interspersed with precipitating incidents created a tinderbox that eventually exploded.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½What makes the Hainan incident ominous is that the cultural nations of America may be gradually coming to the idea that America might fight China one day ï¿½ with the moralists convinced by Tiananmen Square, prison labor and Tibet that the Chinese leadership needs correction; the pragmatists, still excited by the Chinese market but sobered by the problematic experience with investments and joint ventures, unwilling to see Taiwan ruined; and the Southerners, sensitive to slights to personal honor, susceptible to outrage if the Hainan incident becomes a hostage crisis.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The final ingredient for terrible war is the miscalculation by the other side. The Southern fire-eaters of 1861 were convinced that the Yankees were cowards who wouldn't fight, and if they did, would give up after the first defeat. Hitler thought the Americans (and the British) were cowardly and pacifistic jitterbugging money-grubbers who wouldn't fight and couldn't win.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Misguided by the war in Vietnam and the cost-free victories of the Gulf and Kosovo, the Chinese may be calculating that the way to deter an American response is to incur significant American casualties early on.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This was the alignment during the first half of the Cold War, but restraint on both sides kept it from breaking into a great war. This was in part because the Soviet leaders had seen what an engaged America at war was like. The Chinese could miscalculate that such a level of engagement could never happen again.

My book defines "radiance" in terms of the amount of energy radiated

surface of different materials at various temperatures can be
The radiance of a cavity to the surface material can be compared and
it is higher.  The radiance of two cavities is the same, but this is
not immediately obvious to the uninitiated.  It's a reasonable thing
to measure and discuss.
If you don't already know, it's actually surprising.
It's not surprising when a hot body and a cold body approach the same
But, in the case described the two bodies start out at the same
temperature.  One radiates more energy towards the other one at that
particular temperature.  So, you would expect that one body would
become hotter than the other.

engine which would return the two materials back to the same
temperature, but also do some work in the meantime - a perpetual
motion machine.
solution.  The photons going between the two blocks of metal will
"thermalize" and the volume between the two blocks will look like the
inside of a cavity.  The rate of energy transfer in each direction
will then be the same.
In fact, if the two blocks were contained in a large thermos which
perfectly reflected the photons, the same effect would occur.  It
would be like an inside out cavity.  Each block would end up at the
same temperature.  (Perhaps slightly lower than the start temperature
because it must take some energy to fill the space with thermalized

@_subject: NYT: Organized Crime Case Raises Privacy Issues 
By JOHN SCHWARTZ
icodemo S. Scarfo Jr. might seem an unlikely champion of civil liberties in
the high-tech age. Mr. Scarfo, the son of the jailed mob boss "Little Nicky"
Scarfo, has been awaiting trial on charges of running gambling and loan sharking
operations for the Gambino crime family.
But like so many businessmen today, Mr. Scarfo kept his data on his personal
computer; and like many other businessmen, he encrypted the sensitive stuff
to protect it from prying eyes.
Today, a federal judge in Newark will hear defense motions to throw out evidence
gathered by a controversial new law enforcement technology: a system that recorded
every keystroke typed on Mr. Scarfo's computer, including the password that
investigators used to unscramble Mr. Scarfo's files. That wrinkle in the case
makes the United States v. Scarfo the latest battleground in a growing struggle
to determine the proper balance between the government's ability to conduct
surveillance and a citizen's right to privacy.
"It raises a whole issue of invasive law enforcement technology that really
hasn't been considered by the courts yet," said David L. Sobel, who has followed
the case closely as the general counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information
Center in Washington.
The Scarfo case comes at a time of rising concern about the government's power
to snoop. In other cases, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's use of an Internet
wiretap system initially known as Carnivore ignited opposition from privacy
advocates and a number of Republican lawmakers, who said the technology sampled
the communications of many customers of an Internet provider, not just the
suspects. Similarly, public uproar accompanied the announcement that Tampa
had installed surveillance cameras with facial recognition technology to spot
criminal suspects in the city's Ybor entertainment district.
The courts are paying attention. The Supreme Court, in a case known as Kyllo
v. the United States, which was decided in June, restricted the ability of
police to use thermal imaging cameras to look inside houses without a search
warrant. In the majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that the court
was confronting a fundamental question about the Fourth Amendment: "what limits
there are upon this power of technology to shrink the realm of guaranteed privacy."
When the police raided Mr. Scarfo's business, Merchant Services of Essex County
in Belleville, N.J., in January 1999, they found a computer and copied the
contents of its hard drive. But investigators could not read one file on the
machine, because it had been encrypted using a common program, PGP, which stands
for Pretty Good Privacy.
Encryption has become an essential part of doing business on the Internet for
companies and consumers alike. And the rising use of encryption technology
has long been a concern of the F.B.I., which has said the technology could
be devastating to criminal investigations.
The Scarfo case shows one way the F.B.I. has tried to address the problem.
Agents went back into Mr. Scarfo's business under court order and surreptitiously
installed what court papers identify only as a "key logger system" on the target
PC. The F.B.I. would not say whether the system was a hardware device or purely
software, or give any details about how it worked, except to say that it recorded
every keystroke entered into the machine.
Agents returned to Mr. Scarfo's business over the following months to retrieve
data recorded by the system. Ultimately, the logger captured a password, nds09813-050.
Mr. Scarfo had apparently changed his password, however, because it did not
decrypt the original file. But investigators found new versions of the file
on floppy disks in Mr. Scarfo's home, and the password worked to unscramble
the file, which prosecutors say contained accounts of gambling and loan activities.
(The annual interest rate on the loans, as calculated by the F.B.I., was 152
In briefs presented to Judge Nicholas H. Politan of United States District
Court, who will preside over today's hearing, Mr. Scarfo and his lawyers assert
that any evidence collected with the help of the keyboard logger should be
thrown out because the technology was not used in ways that passed Constitutional
muster. They say that because the keyboard logger collected everything Mr.
Scarfo typed, the court order permitting its use violated longstanding constitutional
rules that search warrants and evidence collection should be as narrow as possible.
They also assert that the technology is like a wiretap, and that therefore
the relatively difficult process of obtaining an electronic communications
wiretap order, known in law enforcement as a "Title III" order, should have
been followed, instead of the more basic search warrant procedure. Mr. Scarfo's
lawyers have demanded full technical details of the key logger system.
The assistant United States attorney on the case, Ronald D. Wigler, said in
his court response to Mr. Scarfo that the technology was used in full compliance
with the law. In the brief, he refused to discuss technical details of the
"sensitive law enforcement technique," saying that to do so would tip the hand
of law enforcement in future cases. Mr. Wigler also said that the system did
not record any e-mail communications and so the requirements for a wiretap
warrant did not apply: "Letters do not become `electronic communications' subject
to Title III merely because they happen to have been typed on a computer."
All lawyers involved with the case are under court order not to speak about
the case.
Mr. Sobel said the use of keyboard loggers was a new area of surveillance that
posed a threat to personal privacy. "If what this case means is we are about
to see an explosion in the number of surreptitious police entries," he said,
"that's a troubling development." Mr. Sobel, who has advised Mr. Scarfo's lawyers in the case and has followed
it closely, said, "It's a very serious precedent." As people's computers become
their mailboxes, home shopping malls, entertainment centers and more, he said,
technologies like the key logger system give law enforcement "a secret means
of monitoring all of that activity." Mark Rasch, an expert in government surveillance, said he was concerned about
the use of the key logger before its constitutional implications have been
thoroughly considered by policy makers.
"What I want to know is the extent to which government believes it is entitled
to invade privacy within the bounds of the law," said Mr. Rasch, a vice president
of Predictive Systems (news/quote), a network consulting firm. He is also a
former Justice Department lawyer who has consulted with a civil liberties group
following the case.
Philip R. Zimmermann, the creator of the program used by Mr. Scarfo and millions
of other people worldwide, said, "I knew PGP would be used by criminals; I
felt bad about that."
He also said, however, that "the good uses to which PGP is put are so compelling
that we have to factor that into the whole equation." He recalled inventing
the program 10 years ago with goals like promoting privacy and protecting political
dissidents around the world.
But most powerful technologies, like automobiles, "have mixed effects on society,"
he said. "The fact that criminals use cars doesn't mean that the rest of us
shouldn't have cars."

                taxpayers more than anticipated.

@_subject: Gmail as Blacknet 
The privacy news has been full of fuss and bluster lately about
Google's proposed Gmail service.  The latest complaint comes at
 with an open letter from
dozens of privacy groups to the Google founders asking them to revamp
the service.
Cypherpunks have two somewhat contradictory positions on the issue.
First, as lovers of privacy, they will share the concerns in the letter
and they would be reluctant to use Gmail as configured, at least with
any pseudonym which hoped to retain privacy.  But second, as lovers of
freedom, they would encourage Google and every other company to experiment
with new services and new technologies, allowing individuals to freely
decide whether to use them or not.
One of the oldest Cypherpunk philosophical thought experiments
was BlackNet, a hypothetical offshore data haven whose main job,
paradoxically, was to defeat privacy.  BlackNet would serve as a market
and a storage facility for information that might be of value, one example
being credit rating information.  BlackNet demonstrated that even when
third parties sought to prevent the flow of information, for example
by mandating that credit report data be deleted after so many years,
Cypherpunk technologies could keep the information available and alive.
Oddly, few Cypherpunks appeared to notice the inconsistency with a
supposedly privacy-oriented group promoting a technology which would
harm privacy.  The actual resolution is that Cypherpunks see privacy as
a means to an end.  That end is freedom.  Privacy will lead to freedom
by allowing people to communicate and contract without interference and
meddling by interlopers.  BlackNet is an example of the kind of system
which would appear if people were truly free.  That it harms privacy is
merely an incidental side effect.
The lesson is that Cypherpunks value freedom over privacy.  They will
therefore welcome Gmail as an institutional experiment that demonstrates
the value of freedom, even if they personally would rather not partake
of its services.
Ironically, some of the features of Gmail bear resemblance to BlackNet.
In particular, its claimed policy of retaining email indefinitely,
even after the recipient has stopped using the account, is reminiscent
of BlackNet's function as a data haven, as well as other Cypherpunk
projects like the Eternity Network.  This retention is objectionable to
conventional privacy groups, but Cypherpunks will recognize it as being
deeply in accord with their values.
And of course the real lesson of Gmail is that we have no way of
knowing whether Hotmail and other web based email providers are doing
the same thing, but more quietly.  These companies may be retaining
and archiving email to a far greater degree than most people imagine.
Cypherpunks know that trusting third parties to protect their information
is the height of foolishness.
rather, all web mail systems should be understood as fundamentally
inconsistent with privacy.  If you want privacy, you have to do it
yourself.  Writing an angry letter is at best going to make the privacy
violations more covert.  It accomplishes nothing in the end.

@_subject: Gmail as Blacknet 
You have missed the point of the analogy entirely.  BlackNet makes
information available even when the subjects of the information (or
any other parties) want it suppressed.  It is a censorship-proof store
of data.  If information about you is stored in BlackNet, anyone can get
access to it (for a price, perhaps), and you can't do anything about it.
To make Gmail more like BlackNet, you should first do as others have
suggested and access it via cryptographic anonymity techniques (see the
recent announcements for the onion routing network now being developed,
  Now you can use it as a store of data
for your pseudonym without linking to your true identity.
A second step is to then PGP-encrypt all email going to your Gmail
address.  This could be done easily by someone writing a mail forwarder
which accepted email for any username, looked up a PGP key for that name
and encrypted the email, then forwarded it along to the corresponding
username at Gmail.  This would be less than one page of Perl.  You would
give out the name of a system running such a script as your email address,
but your encrypted mail would then be stored and accessed at Gmail.
You'd gain the advantage of their multi gigabyte storage facility while
protecting the privacy of your own email.  And I'd like to see their
adwords facility struggling to come up with something appropriate when
the only legible text is "BEGIN PGP ENCRYPTED MESSAGE".
A third step is to get a browser plugin which would transparently
decrypt PGP encrypted email stored at web mail services like Gmail,
Yahoo mail, etc.  At one time this would have been an overwhelmingly
difficult task due to the multiplicity of browsers; at a later time,
it would have been impractical due to the dominance of IE; but today,
with Mozilla becoming a widely used, standardized, open source alternative
to IE, it is finally possible for such browser customizations to become
generally available and useful.
So there you have it, a simple three step program to turn your Gmail
account into a privacy-protected, virtually unlimited-size data store.

Regarding the question of whether debt must be merely 'forgiven'
or actually 'forgotten', see  for
information on the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970:
"The FCRA limits the length of time some information can appear in a
consumer report.  For instance, bankruptcies must be removed from the
report after 10 years.  Civil suits, civil judgments, paid tax liens,
accounts placed for collection, and records of arrest can only appear
for 7 years."
BlackNet thwarts such limitations on the reporting of consumer credit.
Clearly, providing access to this data harms individual privacy.
Yet Cypherpunks traditionally have supported this concept.  A privacy
advocacy group promotes technology which would aid the compilation of
individual dossiers and allow access to personally identifying data
about past financial transactions.
Of course, these were "classical" Cypherpunks, from the days when
"men were men and giants walked the earth".  They understood that the
way to keep data private was not to let it out in the first place.
They believed in freedom: freedom of association, freedom of contract.
They saw privacy as a means to achieve that freedom, not as an end
in itself.
Today, the Cypherpunks list is but a shadow of its former glory, with
anarcho-capitalism all but forgotten in favor of fashionable nihilism,
libertarians replaced by liberals.  Perhaps it is not too late to
resurrect the ideals of the past, but it will require hard work and open

@_subject: On Needing Killing 
No, they don't.
There are two alternative solutions to the problem of restrictions on
information flow, or more generally restrictions on any sort of voluntary
and cooperative activity.  One is to use force to fight back, even to
the point of killing the perpetrators.  This is what you are advocating
when you say they "need killing".
The other is to evade the restrictions.  This does not involve killing,
force, or violence of any sort.  Cryptography is an ideal tool for this
purpose.  It allows people to communicate and exchange data even when
outsiders want them to stop.  Via digital cash they can even contract
together, and buy and sell information and services.  BlackNet is intended
to be an example of how this could work.
The point is that BlackNet and other early Cypherpunk concepts
were intended to be based on the second approach, that of avoiding
restrictions via cryptographic protections.  BlackNet does not seek out
and kill people who try to shut it down.  It simply continues to exist
and operate, very profitably, despite the efforts of its opponents.
In a world where things like BlackNet can exist, the people who want to
stop it don't need to be killed, because their actions are ineffective.
We don't kill the crazy men who rant and rave in parks and on sidewalks.
We may pity them, we may even try to help them, but we don't kill them.
Similarly, if Cypherpunk technology succeeds, those who try to stop
communication from occuring will be no more important or effective in
achieving their goals.
This stuff should be Cypherpunks 101.  Not even that; it should be
Kindergarten for Cypherpunks.  Re-read (or read for the first time!) the
Cryptoanarchist Manifesto.  There's nothing in there about killing
those responsible for restricting freedom.  Rather, the entire essay
is about how the new technologies will allow people to communicate and
interact with privacy and security.  The same is true of the Cypherpunk's
Manifesto; again, it is about using software to defend privacy with
cryptographic anonymity.  There's no bloodlust in either of these essays.
These were the founding documents of the Cypherpunk movement.
It was only after many years that some Cypherpunks took a detour into
advocacy of violence.  In large part this was due to the influence of
Tim May, who as time went by became increasingly bitter and hateful.
Perhaps he had personal disappointments; in particular it seemed that
the failure of his more apocalyptic Y2K predictions was an embarrassment
which he took to covering with bluster and rage.
May became a loud, authoritative and dominating voice calling for violent
retribution against government agents or anyone whom he saw as a threat
or enemy.  Inevitably, he brought into the list people who felt the same
way, and drove away many who could not stand the anger and hatred which
were being expressed so openly.  His increasingly common racist rhetoric,
whether sincere or merely provocative, played a further role in sending
away some and, sadly, drawing in others.
The community changed, until today Cypherpunks are known as a community
which sees that its enemies "need killing".  It's almost a defining
characteristic.  The original goals of cryptoanarchy, privacy, anonymity,
reputation systems, and efforts to explore the underlying technology,
are largely forgotten.
But now it seems that there might be an opportunity for change.  With the
departure of Tim May, a cloud seems to have lifted.  Perhaps it will
be possible to reinvigorate the community, to give it new purpose and
new goals.  At a minimum, can we try to move beyond defining ourselves by
how many enemies we think "need killing"?  That was never what Cypherpunks
were supposed to be about.

That's irrelevant.  These arguments that Gmail is just like other services
are nothing but red herrings.
Surely cypherpunks should understand that the recipient of a message
can do whatever he wants with it.  He can save it to disk, he can
share it with his friends, or he can contract with Gmail to add targeted
advertising.  It's contrary to everything cypherpunks stand for to suggest
that the sender of a message should have some power or authority over
what happens to it once it is in the receiver's hands.
Even if Gmail were completely new and nothing like it had ever existed in
the world before, it would be perfectly acceptable for mail recipients
to use the service.  That follows from their inherent freedom to use
the information under their control.
Please save these tired arguments by analogy for another forum.
Cypherpunks agree on the basic desirability of individual freedom,
and that is enough to settle the question.

Fine; you are questioning the feasibility of the cypherpunk model for
achieving freedom through cryptographic anonymity.  It is true that
power in the physical world can, in principle, prevent the operation
of the information infrastructure necessary for the cypherpunk dream
to be realized.  Whether it can do so without also impairing "good"
information transfers to an unacceptable level remains to be seen.
But suppose you're right; suppose men with guns keep crypto anarchy from
working, and the only recourse is to use force of your own.  Then what are
you doing here?  This list is for discussing and implementing cypherpunk
concepts.  If you deny them, you should go elsewhere to pursue your goals.
The practical problem with using force is that people will fight back.
And there are far more of them than you.  In a democratic system,
government policies have widespread support.  If you start knocking off
California legislators you will soon find the massive might of the State
directed against your health and well being.  Your goals of anarchy and
freedom are never going to be popular enough to let you win by using
force in this way.
Some have said they want to use cypherpunk technology to facilitate
their plans for using force to fight the oppressors.  They can set up
assassination markets; or more simply, hire hitmen anonymously using
ecash.  In this way they can bring force to bear without risk.
But this reasoning is self-contradictory.  If force is necessary, it
is because cypherpunk technology has failed.  As you predict, "Men with
Guns" will be controlling the bits via their control of physical reality.
There will be no anonymous assassination markets to help you pursue your
violent goals.
But the reverse is true as well: if and when such markets come to exist,
it can only be because the cypherpunk dream has succeeded beyond our
wildest hopes.  A world in which such applications exist despite the
most stringent efforts on the part of the State to eradicate them is one
in which cypherpunks have truly succeeded in burrowing so deep into the
information infrastructure that they can never be stopped.  It is a world
in which anonymity is preserved, one where contracts and payment systems
have been developed for even the most risky and uncertain enterprises.
If cypherpunk technology works to this degree, then it will open up
tremendous new opportunities for people to evade the power of government.
The one overwhelming trend as we move into the 21st century is the power
of information.  This is why governments more and more are trying to crack
down and limit its propagation.  If cypherpunk technologies are able to
transcend these restrictions, as is implied by the potential existence of
assassination markets, there is essentially no limit to what they can do.
The physical world is going to be increasingly less important as we go
forward.  What counts is the flow of information.  That is what needs
to be protected and made free from interference.  If we can achieve
that, the physical world won't much matter.  You won't need your guns,
and assassination markets, if they exist, won't be a force for freedom,
but merely another hazard of the physical world, that most people avoid
as much as possible.

@_subject: Anonymity vs reputation question 
Yes, you can do this, but there are some problems.
First, what is a reputation?  Reputations are in people's minds.  Any nym
will have a different reputation with different people.  The only way
the new nym could have exactly the same reputation with everyone would
be for it to be explicitly linked to the old nym, defeating the purpose
of switching.
Therefore the new nym's reputation will have to be a simple subset of
the reputation of the old nym, in order that many nyms will have equal
reputation and the new one won't be linked.  This suggests a simple
boolean ranking where one or more respected figures can give their
endorsement to a nym, and then the new nym can start up and say that it
is endorsed by so-and-so.  As long as that person gave out quite a few
endorsements then there will not be too much linkage to the old nym.
As someone mentioned, this is the problem which is solved by cryptographic
credentials, like those of Chaum or Brands.  The "reputation judge"
gives out an endorsement credential to those nyms he deems worthy; then
through various cryptographic techniques these credentials can be shown
by the new nyms.
A simple version of this would be to use the same Chaum blind signatures
that are used for ecash.  When the reputation judge gives out the
credential, in addition to signing the nym, he also issues a blind
signature on a blinded identity offered by the nym owner.  The judge
can't see what nym he is signing, but later that nym can show that its
identity is signed by the reputation judge.  Brands credentials basically
work this same way.
A problem with this is that only one new nym gets endorsed, so the
holder can only switch identities once.  To fix this, the judge could
issue several blind signatures, say about 5, which would accommodate
that many identity switches.
An even simpler approach would be for the reputation judge to create a
common public key to be used as a signing key by everyone he endorses.
When he endorses someone he reveals to them, privately, the secret key
used to sign with the common public key.  Then all nyms who have received
the endorsement can sign with the common key in addition to their own.
When the nym switches identities he still knows the common signing key
and can sign with it along with the new nym.
The problem with this class of systems is that if anyone leaks the common
private key, then the security of the endorsement is lost and anyone
can pretend to be endorsed.  A similar flaw with the previous proposal
is that if someone gets several blind endorsements, they might give some
away or sell some, and the new buyers might misuse them, cheapening the
value of the endorsement.
Yet another method, good if there aren't more than a dozen or so nyms
which are endorsed, is to use a ring or group signature.  The reputation
judge publishes a list of keys that he endorses, and then anyone on the
list can make a signature which can be verified as coming from one of
the keys, but there is no way to tell which one made it.
This has a security problem similar with the 2nd approach, that someone
on the list could secretly give away his private key to other people,
and they could sign bad messages, with no way to tell which person
on the list created them.  The reputation judge could address this by
withdrawing his endorsement of the last few list members, and seeing if
the problem goes away, but it would be a complicated and messy situation.

@_subject: What Should Freedom Lovers Do? 
Lew Rockwell had written:
This is good advice for cypherpunks as well.  We all support the victory
of liberty, and we have a moral passion for justice.  Whether our means
are the speedious and most efficacious may be questionable, but it's
not like other forums are seeing vastly greater success.  And it's best
if freedom lovers push forward on all fronts.  Our goals of providing
liberty through cryptography are complementary to other efforts to
achieve freedom.
But the last point is the one I want to emphasize, a continuing theme in
my writings for the past several years: that the means must not contradict
the goal.  Too often have cypherpunks fallen into the trap of advocating
violence and aggression as a means to achieve their freedoms.  Tim May was
the worst of these, wishing for the nuclear obliteration of Washington,
cheering the Oklahoma City bombings, even threatening the lives of family
members of those who would break their word to him.  The destruction of
innocents must never be part of the agenda of a supporter of freedom.
Of course, if we stick to cypherpunk means, the issue does not arise.
Cryptographic anonymity threatens no one but aggressors.  It is purely
defensive in nature.  Using PGP, TOR or Freenet does not harm innocent
children or anyone else.  Yet these technologies open up new possibilities
for freedom of speech today, and hopefully for freedom of contract in
the future.
In my devotion to freedom, I apparently go beyond the point where most
cypherpunks are comfortable, in that I support private initiatives and
technologies of all sorts and oppose government regulation of them.
I am a supporter and admirer of Microsoft, which has achieved tremendous
market success without relying on government support, indeed in the
face of steadfast government opposition.  I oppose government antitrust
efforts in general, and specifically those directed against Microsoft.
Yet how many other cypherpunks have spoken up in favor of this widely
hated company?  Where is your love of freedom, if you can be silent in
the face of government infringement of their rights?  Re-read Rothbard's
fourth point, and understand that support of antitrust actions is exactly
what he cautions against.
Last year a widely published diatribe against online "monoculture" called
for Microsoft to be compelled to engage in all sorts of activities,
including rewriting all their software to run on Linux.  This homage
to statism was authored by, among others, a man who once called himself
libertarian: Perry Metzger, moderator of the cryptography mailing list.
No one who loves freedom should allow himself to be associated with any
such proposal.
Likewise, I support privately organized technological initiatives such as
DRM and even Trusted Computing.  It doesn't matter what the net impact
or effects of these technologies will be (although I think they will be
overall neutral to positive).  The only important point is that these
are free and non-coercive, without government regulation.  Of course,
DRM is presently strengthened by the DMCA, an evil and counter-productive
infringement on personal rights, but here it is important to focus on
what is wrong and what is right.  What is wrong is government restriction;
what is right is technology and contract to enforce mutually agreed-upon
conditions and permissions.
Cypherpunks should take a close look at how they choose which issues to
support and oppose.  Bear in mind Rothbard's advice against advocating
aggression against liberty, advocating planned programs, or supporting
the increase in State power in any area.  We must be uncompromising
in our support for freedom and liberty.  If we stick to our goals of
building technology to let people communicate privately and anonymously,
that will be our contribution to the freedom of the future world.

student Niels MC6ller, described briefly at
 "For my master of science
thesis, I implemented an offline digital cash system invented by Stefan
Brands. I haven't done anything about it since I got my MSc degree,
but the information about it is still available."
Well, the information isn't available, not there, anyway.  But if you
hunt around, you can find an announcement about NCash at
and the source code plus a technical paper are at
The good news is that the source code is available; the bad news is that
it is written in Pike.  No, I'd never heard of it, either.  Apparently it
is some Swedish language that was all the rage back in 1997.  However it
seems to be a pretty straightforward language, kind of Pythonish with a C
like syntax, so it might be feasible to port it to something more modern,
probably Python.  Or you could get the latest Pike interpreter and see
how well they've maintained backwards compatibility all these years.
According to the announcement, you'll also need the Pike crypto library,
but my guess is that it's been incorporated into the Pike package by
this time.
I'm sure you're aware that Brands credentials are patented up the wazoo.

@_subject: no anon conversations? 
A simple option is to use a free webmail account and access it via an
anonymizing proxy.  You can send mail that way too.  The great advantage
of this is that it does not brand you as an "anonymous mail user" and
thereby call attention to your activities.  You look like just another
of the millions of people who use such services.
For anonymizing proxies, do a google search on anonymous web surfing.
There are many more companies than anonymizer.com, although it is the
oldest and probably the best.  You can also begin experimenting with the
onion routing network at   This is like a
free version of the old ZKS Freedom network where you construct a path
through a number of forwarding nodes.  You could also combine these and
use TOR to access anonymizer.com and go from there to hotmail.com, etc.
There's a new proposal out called the Pynchon Gate from Len Sassaman and
Bram Cohen,   Sassaman is
one of the main Mixmaster/Mixminion developers, and Cohen of course
has revolutionized the P2P file sharing scene this past year with his
BitTorrent.  These guys have a pretty good pedigree for getting stuff
done, and they claim to be in the process of implementing this new system.
The Pynchon Gate will use a crypto protocol called Private Information
Retrieval to let people receive messages anonymously.  The way PIR works,
all the incoming messages for all users are stored in a big database
which is replicated at several servers.  Recipients connect to each
server and download a packet of data, which is combined at the local
machine to reconstruct one incoming message.  However the algorithm is
such that each individual server learns nothing about which message is
being fetched, protecting the receiver's anonymity.
Here's a simple example of how it would work.  The method relies on
two properties of XOR:  XORing a value with itself yields zero; and the
result of XORing a random value with a predetermined pattern is still
a random value.
Suppose there are only two database servers, each holding 8 messages,
where the messages are all split or padded to be a standard size:
    M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M7 M8
Suppose you want to fetch M4.  Now you create a random 8-bit binary
    1  0  1  0  0  0  0  1
Make a copy of that string and XOR in the bit position of the message
we want, in this the 4th bit:
    1  0  1  1  0  0  0  1
Note that because of the 2nd property of XOR listed above, both bit
strings are individually indistinguishable from random and neither by
itself gives any information about which bit was XOR'd.
Send the first bit string to the first server and the 2nd bit string to
the 2nd server.  Each server XOR's the messages corresponding to the 1
bits and returns the results, which will be the size of single standard
    Server 1:  M1 xor M3 xor M8
    Server 2:  M1 xor M3 xor M4 xor M8
The recipient xors these two messages together:
    (M1 xor M3 xor M8) xor (M1 xor M3 xor M4 xor M8)
=   (M1 xor M1) xor (M3 xor M3) xor (M8 xor M8) xor M4
=   M4
The result is the required message.  Individually, each server saw a
random bit string and neither one by itself had any indication about which
message was being fetched, hence the recipient's anonymity was protected.
The same method can be generalized to larger numbers of servers, and
that is the intention with the Pynchon Gate system.
The privacy threat with this approach is that if the servers combine
their information, they can deduce which message the recipient was
fetching, by XORing all their bit strings together.  However, as long
as even one server is honest and refuses to go along with this, the
other servers can learn nothing about which message was being fetched.
This security guarantee is similar to that of a remailer chain, where
if they all colluded they could track user messages, but if at least
one is honest then privacy is protected.  Hence it is a good match for
users who rely on remailers.
It's not yet clear that this method can be really practical, can scale
to a reasonable number of users, resist flooding, and avoid leaking
information in terms of how many requests a given user makes in a
given period of time.  These are serious practical issues that need to
be solved.
But they do have one really good idea, which is that the user-end software
will be an agent that executes this protocol on a regular basis to
fetch messages, then makes them available to the mail client by acting
as a local POP server.  All modern mail clients let you set multiple
POP servers to be queried, so this should produce nearly transparent
integration to existing mail clients.  This concept might be copied for
other mail receiving methods in the future.

@_subject: The EFF Offers a Better Way Forward on File Sharing 
Invisiblog is a service which uses anonymous remailers and gpg-signed
messages to allow bloggers to make their contributions anonymously.
The following essay is taken from the Unlimited Freedom blog:
 .
It discusses the EFF white paper on file sharing at:
 .
Thanks to Derek Slater for his pointer to an interesting new proposal
for handling music file sharing.
I've criticized the EFF in the past, but their new white paper is
definitely worth a read. "A Better Way Forward: Voluntary Collective
Licensing of Music File Sharing" has some great ideas and would be a
terrific solution to the file sharing problem if it could be made to
work. I do see some problems, but perhaps they can be solved, and in
any case the concept looks highly promising.
Voluntary Collective Licensing (VCL), as the EFF explains, is the system
used by radio broadcasters and other public performers to compensate
the music copyright owners. The broadcasters pay a fee to ASCAP and
other collection societies to gain the rights to play the music;
ASCAP then divides it up and pays it out to the artists. Having just
a few collective organizations like ASCAP makes it easy for the radio
broadcasters to license all the music they play.
The same idea in the P2P world would mean that users would pay a fixed
fee to the VCL agency, which the EFF suggests might be a modest five
dollars a month. This would then give them the rights to freely download
and share all the songs belonging to the artists (or record companies)
which had joined the VCL collective. The fees would be divided among
the artists using a combination of something like Nielsen ratings
plus monitoring public file sharing activity. Users would be free of
the threat of lawsuits or of the record companies using the various
technical countermeasures which are continually being developed and
deployed. And the record companies would be making money from the P2P
filesharing phenomenon which shows no sign of stopping.
My initial reaction to this proposal doesn't even need to get past the
first word. It's voluntary? I'm for it.
Look up at the top of this blog and you see what I'm about. Voluntary
arrangements are the essence of freedom as I see it. This is why I support
trusted computing and DRM, as well as encryption and anonymity. All of
these are technologies which people can use voluntarily to interact with
each other in new and powerful ways. Giving people access to the maximal
set of options in their lives is part of what I call Unlimited Freedom.
And the EFF proposal truly is voluntary. Artists would only join the
collective if they chose to do so; but staying outside would force the
artists to pursue expensive legal and technical warfare against file
sharers. Users would only sign up and pay the fees if they wanted to; but
refusing to pay would expose them to the hassles and hardship of illegal
downloading (not to mention the ethical conflicts). The EFF points out
that current anti-trust laws might interfere with the formation of a VCL
agency, but from the libertarian perspective I am of course entirely in
favor of weakening antitrust.
So before going on to criticize the proposal, I want to emphasize again
how pleased I am that the EFF has come up with an idea which respects
principles of freedom and choice for all parties. It makes me proud that
I have joined EFF and have supported it with contributions over the years.
However, while the goals of the VCL are laudable and the methods are
highly ethical, I do see practical difficulties which the EFF seems
overly optimistic about. These are fundamentally due to the loss of
price information which is such a crucial part of a normal market
structure. With music downloads disconnected from costs, signals are
no longer automatically provided to the producers to show how consumer
demand is being distributed. While the plan tries to provide proxies
and other mechanisms to provide this information, it is extremely hard
to do so reliably.
More concretely, there are three obvious problems with the idea. First,
people are still going to freeload, and it's possible that the greater
availability of legal P2P filesharing will be exploitable by illegal file
traders to make their jobs that much easier. Second, setting the size
of the per-month fees is going to be a difficult and risky calculation,
and it's all too likely that the artists will initially err on the side
of caution, setting them too high for the plan to succeed. And third,
finding a reliable way to divide up the proceeds which accurately reflects
listener preferences will be difficult, since cheaters will have financial
motivation to distort the results.
As far as illegal file sharing, the EFF very optimistically and
idealistically predicts that if the license fee is in the modest range
they suggest, $5/month, users will want to be honest and enjoy the ethical
and practical gains from getting their music legally and honorably. I
have real admiration for the EFF's high opinion of the file sharing
community. The EFF has worked with members of this group for years,
and they should have a good sense of how file traders feel.
But I'm sure that even the EFF would admit that there might well be a
significant percentage of people who will refuse to pay any amount for
the privilege of downloading music. I have certainly seen such sentiments
expressed in various online forums. Many people have come of age with
the expectation that music ought to be free, because that is all they
have known. They see the creation of music as an inexhaustable fountain
from which they can drink as often and as long as they wish. Now that
they have gotten used to having their music for free, they won't want
to go back to paying for it.
The existence of such people is going to make the whole plan more
expensive and difficult, in several ways. For one thing, the only thing
that will motivate people to stay with the program and not freeload
will be some kind of negative consequence if they leave. So the record
companies may have to continue their program of lawsuits and technical
countermeasures, even once the VCL plan is in place. A major potential
cost savings thus does not materialize. And even if the percentage of
freeloaders is small, the expense of the lawsuits may have to continue
to be large, in part because locating such people may be more difficult
now that they can hide among a much larger number of legal file sharers.
If the freeloaders can't be effectively deterred, then their existence
will serve as a constant temptation for legal members to quit the
program. We have all seen situations where a law which is ignored with
impunity by a minority eventually becomes less respected by everyone. The
same kind of gradual breakdown would be a constant threat to a VCL
program. It's not like radio, where there are only a few hundred or
thousand broadcasters. We're talking millions or potentially billions
of people now, and the enforcement lessons from radio are not applicable.
Another problem with the EFF plan is setting the size of the VCL fees. I
give the EFF enormous credit for resisting the temptation to put the
government in control of this aspect of the program. Politicizing this
issue would be disastrous. Letting the creators of the music (or their
agents) decide how much they are willing to let it go for is the only
free, fair and economically sound possibility.
Nevertheless, there are going to be significant practical difficulties
in getting a reasonable licensing fee. First, from the theoretical side,
it's not even clear what kind of fee we would see, if the VCL agency had
perfect knowledge. What would maximize their profits? As they increase
their fees, revenue per subscriber goes up, but they lose subscribers,
and face the costs described above to try to coax people back into the
program. But as further argued above, those enforcement costs may not
be able to be reduced below a threshold value, since people can always
leave the program and potentially still get access to music. It's a
complicated tradeoff.
It's often the practice, with new business models, to set initial fees
on the high side in order to reduce risk. Then the fees can be gradually
lowered as market demand increases. This provides for a gradual and
manageable growth rate. The VCL agency probably can't realistically sign
up and manage 100 million subscribers the first year. They might prefer
to set the fees high enough so that they have only a million subscribers
that first year, and then bring them down gradually. This will also give
them a sense of the shape of the demand curve, how many more subscribers
they get for a particular decrease in licensing fees.
For these reasons, I'd expect the fees to be quite a bit higher than the
EFF estimate of five dollars a month, especially at first. Hopefully they
would come down within a few years, and maybe the EFF goal would not be
too far off, eventually. But initially the plan will face criticism and
disillusionment if the fees are considerably higher than were initially
promised. As far as likely long-term licensing rates, I'd like to see
some analysis and modeling of this tradeoff which could shed more light
on where a good price point is likely to be found.
The third problem I listed is the difficulty of accurately figuring
out how the proceeds should be distributed to the artists. The EFF
report suggests copying the Nielsen ratings and having randomly selected
families allow their downloads to be monitored. This isn't a bad idea,
but the problem is that there are far more songs in common use than
TV shows. At any given time there are probably no more than 200 shows
tracked by the Nielsen ratings. But there must be tens or even hundreds
of thousands of different songs being downloaded in a typical day. That
means that the statistical precision necessary to fairly divide up the
revenues is going to be far more difficult to meet than for TV shows. The
truth is that Nielsen ratings have larger error bars than many people
realize, and once you divide the measurements a hundredfold or worse,
the statistical errors are likely to swamp the measured results. The
noise will overwhelm the signal.
The other idea the EFF suggests is to monitor file sharing activity,
as is done already by companies like Big Champagne. The problem with
this is that at present, no one has much incentive to try to manipulate
this data. But in a VCL system, these measurements will determine the
financial success or failure of artists and record companies. If the
system can be gamed, it will be. So far I haven't seen a proposal that
would both respect user privacy and simultaneously prevent people from
creating bogus download requests or using other tricks to inflate the
numbers for a desired artist or company. The EFF's confidence that these
two methods will work is not well justified at present.
In summary, the EFF's Voluntary Collective License proposal is innovative,
ethical, and idealistic. It respects the freedom of all parties involved
and tries to offer a path which everyone can walk to their mutual
benefit. There are still significant practical problems to be overcome,
but the goal is important and desirable enough that it is worthwhile
putting in effort to see if this system can succeed. Even if it ultimately
fails, VCL should be encouraged as a new, voluntary and creative option
for people to approach the difficult issues of file sharing today.

@_subject: Simplified base64 conversion 
I know there are readers here who are good at optimizing code.  Here are
my attempts to make simple and short versions of base64 encode/decode
in C.  I'd like to hear suggestions on how to simplify them even more.
Base64 encoding is a way of turning arbitrary binary data into printable
characters.  The idea is to take three consecutive 8-bit bytes, treat
this as 24 bits, then cut it into four 6-bit pieces.  Each 6-bit value
gets converted to a printable character from the strings A-Z, a-z, 0-9,
+, /, in that order.  That's 26 + 26 + 10 + 2 characters or 64.
Every 3 input bytes produces 4 output characters.  If the number of input
bytes is not a multiple of 3, for the last partial triplet we produce
2 or 3 characters of output using the 6-bit splitting, then pad with 1
or 2 equals signs (=) to make the output a multiple of 4 characters long.
Typical base64 implementations look more like
 which
are more readable, maybe, or at least more obviously correct.  These pull
out the basic 4-to-3 and 3-to-4 conversion functions, then have a driver
that calls these and takes care of end-message padding and such.
My approach was to use a read-and-write style.  For encoding, read 8
bits, write 6, read 8, write 6, read 8, write 6, write 6.  For decoding,
read 6, read 6, write 8, read 6, write 8, read 6, write 8.  I used a
state variable that counted to 3 for encoding (to 4 for decoding) and
a switch statement to show how to shift the bits around as needed for
the output.  Then on further study I noted that there were patterns in
the shifts that were very simply related to the state variable, so it
was possible to collapse all the cases as far as the shifts, with an if
statement for the extra output or input.
Given the state variable, doing the end padding was pretty simple, but
it would be nice if there were some way to fold that into the main loop.
For decoding, I borrowed an idea from for doing the ascii to binary conversion of the input characters,
and improved it somewhat.  The decode function ignores non-base64
characters so you can feed it input with line breaks and such in it.
(The encode function doesn't put in line breaks, but this could be added.)
One bizarre aspect of the decoder is that = signs are treated as non-b64
data and ignored, yet it still works right for the last 1 or 2 characters,
somewhat fortuitously.  For example, a 1-character input containing the
ascii letter x (0x78) gets encoded as eA==, but you could feed just the
string eA into the base64 decoder and get x out.
Anyway, here are the two functions.  They are released for free use
without restriction, although they are so short that they are hardly
worth copyright.  In exchange I am soliciting suggestions on how to
make them even simpler and more elegant.

On August 6, 2002, Lucky Green wrote a reply to Anonymous (whom I will
now come clean and admit was none other than me), about the suggestion
that TCPA (now called TCG) could incorporate anonymous cryptographic
credentials to protect users' privacy, rather than the cumbersome
"privacy CA" mechanism they actually adopted.
I had written:
Lucky Green replied:
However, it now turns out that TCG has in fact incorporated
exactly the kind of mechanism which Lucky predicted they would be
unreceptive to.  The new TCG 1.2 spec includes "Direct Anonymous
Attestation" based on Camenisch credentials.  See it described at
  Here is the
   This paper describes the direct anonymous attestation scheme (DAA).
   This scheme was adopted by the Trusted Computing Group as the method
   for remote authentication of a hardware module, called trusted platform
   module (TPM), while preserving the privacy of the user of the platform
   that contains the module. Direct anonymous attestation can be seen
   as a group signature without the feature that a signature can be
   opened, i.e., the anonymity is not revocable. Moreover, DAA allows for
   pseudonyms, i.e., for each signature a user (in agreement with the
   recipient of the signature) can decide whether or not the signature
   should be linkable to another signature. DAA furthermore allows for
   detection of "known" keys: if the DAA secret keys are extracted
   from a TPM and published, a verifier can detect that a signature
   was produced using these secret keys. The scheme is provably secure
   in the random oracle model under the strong RSA and the decisional
   Diffie-Hellman assumption.
This is a real cryptographic tour de force.  It protects privacy,
includes irrevocable anonymity, and yet if keys get pulled out of
the system and published, they can be invalidated, even while fully
protecting the anonymity of users of valid keys!  It sounds impossible,
but these guys are wizards.
We haven't heard much from Lucky on TCG/TCPA lately.  It would be
interesting to get his reaction to the latest moves.  One ironic
trend is that although TCPA was claimed to be designed to kill open
source, in fact all the work on the technology is happening on Linux!
See enforcer.sourceforge.net for an example of using TCG to validate a
Linux kernel and executables.  IBM's work on tcgLinux is another project
along these lines.  Pretty exciting stuff.

Well, you're preaching to the choir now, son.  Of course, it's a choir
of one, but c'est la vie.  The idea of finding good uses for Trusted
Computing has not exactly been gushingly popular around here.  In fact,
you yourself have been one of the harshest critics of its pseudonymous
proponent ("intelligent idiot" sound familiar?).
The problem with Palladium as a solution to spam is first, that it is
many years away, being part of the Longhorn OS release.  The latest
official estimates are 2006, rumors are that 2007 is the internal date,
and whispers of 2008 exist.  Then, it will take years before such systems
become widely enough used that spammers can no longer find pre-Palladium
systems to serve as a basis for attacks.  We're probably talking 2011
at the earliest.  We'll need adequate solutions to spam long before then.
Secondly, you could use Palladium to arrange that it was impossible
to send mail from your computer except via human interaction with your
authorized email program.  You'd have to set your outgoing mail server
to require a password (such auth systems are already in widespread use)
and you'd use Pd to lock up the password so that only the mail client
could get at it (using the application-specific sealed storage feature).
The user wouldn't have to type the password, in fact he wouldn't even
have to know there was a password, but he'd have to click the send
button himself.  (Secure user I/O paths are a Palladium feature.)
However, in doing this you give up the ability for ANY other program to
send email, at least without the user jumping through a lot of hoops
to authorize it.  Maybe that's an inherently necessary feature, but
there are arguably some "good" programs which can usefully send email,
and you'll be tossing out those babies with the spam bathwater.  Bye
bye MAPI.
Further, there's always the risk that the email program itself will be
buggy and be able to be tricked into sending something without user
authorization.  Fortunately, the number of such bugs is likely to be
few and confined to just one program, so those can probably be fixed
relatively quickly.
In short, Trusted Computing could in theory make a computer much more
resistant to being used to send spam.  It could still be taken over,
but the malware wouldn't be able to get to the password necessary for
sending mail.  You'd need some help from the ISP to require the password
and possibly block attempts to use remote mail servers.  Of course,
if the ISP is this clueful and cooperative, you'd think maybe it could
stop you from sending a zillion messages per hour in the first place.
The big problem is that TC is many years away.  But now that you know how
good it will be, I hope you will join me in my never ending battle to
bring some perspective to the one-sided "debate" over this technology.
There are good uses of TC, and maybe if people weren't so determined to
oppose it with their last breath, we might see the technology becoming
available a little sooner.
