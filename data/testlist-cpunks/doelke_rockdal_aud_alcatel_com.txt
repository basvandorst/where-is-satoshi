I would also guess it might be something similar to the orderwire in
the telecom industry.  I am more familiar with digital orderwire systems,
but orderwires are generally all similar.  You have a communications link, and some overhead on that link is dedicated to providing a voice channel for communications between sites so that people
working on the line can communicate with each other.
In a crypto system - I could see that the orderwire might be a
in-the-clear transmission as part of the overhead so that people at each end of a hop can figure out why the data (i.e. encrypted) portion
isn't getting through.
