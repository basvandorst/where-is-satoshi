Please check out IDEA contained within PGP2.2 source code...
also look at diffie hellman for session key exchange...

@_subject: CLIPPER: THe battle continues 
Now this is an idea I like... what about using the antitheft-metal base tags that leave a surface impression
when removed... it currently leaves a checkboard pattern but
that could be reworked to say INSECURE , or TAPPED... then post then on every ATT instrument around... including payphones
 the front of the label could make reference to CLIPPER and give a
voicemail number to call for further info... yippie indeed...
    cheers

Thus spake mg at cs.princeton.edu (Michael Golan):
  [stuff about the Quaderno's sound digitising capability]
The speech DSP hardware is quite fancy -- you can download your own
vocoder program, if you have the right DSP code development tools, to
implement things like DTMF-recognition. Or you can select one of the
built-in vocoders, which provide various levels of compression. The
speech program which comes with the Quaderno is just a TSR which hooks
to the speech hardware, and which writes digitised sound to a file.
No reason why you couldn't write your own speech program which grabs digitsed blocks from the DSP [you can give the BIOS the address of a routine to be called when the DSP is ready to deliver] and stuffs them
wheresoever you desire -- such as into the serial port. On the other
end, you have a DSP "play" program -- once again, you can give the
system the address of a routine to be called whenever the DSP is ready
to analogise [?] the next block of bits.
I can't remember, though, what bit-rates are available with the built-in
vocoders. If people are interested, I'll look it up when I get home this
evening [or Don Herrick -- are you there?]. Ah yes -- just remembered
that one of the vocoders churns out 13Kbit/sec with *very* acceptable
quality [for voice -- music sounds like a heap o' crap when pushed through
this particular vocoder]. So this could be stuffed into a regular V.32bis modem and transmitted fast enough to give real-time speech. With its 16MHz V30 CPU, the Quaderno should be more than ready for the task of real-time encryption in software. If my memory serves me, there's also a built-in vocoder which compresses to 2400bits/sec [!] -- the speech program which ships with the Quaderno, however, doesn't offer this as an option, so I've yet to try it. Probably pretty damn bad, though.
Another thought -- the Quaderno's DSP will record and play at the same
time, and V.32bis is full-duplex. So full-duplex conversations on the
above scheme are quite possible. Could be fun -- how to turn a good
3KHz analogue voice line into a fair 13Kbit digital voice line!
And, as mentioned recently in alt.security, you can also use the speech
digitiser for acquiring data with a high degree of randomness, which you then encrypt with a part of itself to produce data which is "truly" random.     /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\

OK So I am extremely irritating... :)(I sincerely
hope I am the biggest BURR under the saddle the government
has had in a long time) I too am disappointed... it had been my understanding
that julf was going to newgroup alt.whistleblowers... no action
on that front... I will be bringing up C-news this week and I will
see about it after that... you shouldnt have to wait too long...
   cheers

Hi John,
    In addition I suggest still some more tools
     newsclip(by clarinet... provides for news clipping)
     newsfind(on soda.berkley.edu for searches of NNTP servers)
     agrep(Fuzzy set searches)
     expn(expanding mail aliases)
     addr-check(expanding and tracing mail aliases)
     netfind(email address searches)
     Xmosaic(hypertest gui... has some useful location features)
     whois(standard NS prog)
For tracing that mysterious person on the end of the line...
    cypherpunks may want to consider
     "How to investigate by computer"
      by Ralph D Thomas
      In-detail explanation of commercial access to xcross,
      criminal justice/public records/postal forwarding/
      credit info...
And the infamous
       "How to get everything on anybody"
        Vols 1 and 2 by Lee Lapin and Scott French
       "The Big Brother Game"
        same
       "Ninja 1990"
        same...
