@_subject: Democracy is our enemy 
We are not a democracy, but a repubic (pun intended). The primary responsibility of our elected officials is to protect the minorities from the majority and to preserve protect and defend the constitution.  Many representatives clearly show they have at best a poor understanding of the Constitution, the words and intentions of the framers.  Some even show disdain for it.  How many Congressmen do you think ever read Thomas Paine's works?
I hope representative government is not.
