@_subject: Active Attacks - Already in Progress? 
Hi Theodore.
The reason the operators of the largest tor relays (Blutmagie,
TorServers, and Amunet) operate multiple instance is because this is
the best way in practice for utilizing large connections. Robert and
others are right and you should call people out if they operate
multiple relays without setting the family entry. However, both of the
relays you cite [1][2] not only have their families set, but contact
information too so you're perfectly able to ask them if you have
In particular Moritz, the operator of TorServers, both discussed his
plans to get funding for running large relays on this list [3] and
with several of us at PETS. I for one am thilled he's had success with
Lastly, it sounds like you're discussing a Sybil attack. This sort of
threat is the reason I wrote a script for monitoring the consensus and
sending alerts when large additions to the tor network are made. You
are more than welcome to keep an eye on this too by subscibing to the
script's email list [4]. Also, this script has discovered this type of
attack in the past, so your concerns are certainly understandable. For
details see the bit about trotsky on the bad exits wiki [5].
So in short, we are well aware of this sort of attack and your
vigilance would certainly be welcome. However, please try to
investigate relays a bit and contact their operators before worrying
too much about them. Cheers! -Damian

@_subject: Arm Release 1.4.0 
Hi. After over a year it's about time that I announced an arm release
so here it is! What's new since August of 2009 [1], you ask? Lots. The
project has been under very active development, continuing to add
usability improvements to make relay operation nicer and less error
prone. If you're really curious what I've been up to this last year
then it's all available in the change log [2].
For those unfamiliar, arm is a terminal monitor for Tor relays and, to
a growing extent, end users. It provides:
 * resource usage (bandwidth, cpu, and memory usage)
 * general relaying information (nickname, fingerprint, flags,
 * event log with optional regex filtering and deduplication
 * connections correlated against tor's consensus data (ip, connection
types, relay details, etc)
 * an editor to quickly alter Tor's configuration
 * torrc configuration file with syntax highlighting and validation
and quite a bit more via a curses interface. For screenshots and
downloads visit:
Peter and I are currently working on getting its debs in shape so
hopefully this'll soon be available via repositories for Debian and
Ubuntu too. RPM builds are available, though I don't have a test
system so beware: there be dragons (possibly).
If there's any python hackers out there interested in dabbling in a
bit of Tor UI development, then I'd love to have some company.
Suggestions, bug reports and feedback are also be very welcome.
Cheers! -Damian
