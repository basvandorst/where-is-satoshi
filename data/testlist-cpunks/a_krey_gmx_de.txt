@_subject: [tor-talk] End-to-end correlation for fun and profit 
Not impossible; but even if they start intercepting the relay
communication that data (and no small amount of it) is still sitting in
disparate systems and needs a) the software to actually do the correlation
and b) the means of all data being moved to one place.
Buying software for a) will probably show up in public records, and b)
may be hindered by the paranoia of the participating LEAs. Even the software
needed to get all the intercepted data in one place could be nightmarish.
