@_subject: IR Blocking. 
The FBI and CIA are operating in Australia now?  wow...  :)
Acutally, since longer wavelegnths are scattered at greater angles,
frosted glass will scatter infrared better than visible light.  It
probably doesn't amount to a large difference tho...and if it did, they
might move up to ultraviolet.  But UV is much easier you to detect, so
they probably wouldn't risk it.  :)
