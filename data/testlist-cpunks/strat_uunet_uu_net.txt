Interesting assertion. I suspect that you could say the same of any
other regional IP provider. A lot of service providers leap to claim the
appelation "common carrier", in the hope that it will absolve them of
responsibility for their users' actions. In the real world, most
providers, including UUNET and PSI, make their customers sign
agreements that said customers won't use the networks for nefarious
ends. Note that the phone company doesn't do this. It'll be a while (and a few court cases) before I have any confidence
that the U.S. Gov't recognizes IP service providers as common carriers
in any real sense. NOTE: I don't speak for anyone but little old me, besides it's
only my 2nd week here. :-)

I would take issue with this statement on its face. I refer you all to
the recent House hearings on Internet Security, and the statements
made by all of the panel members. Reusable passwords are dead. Anyone who insists on using them is part
of the problem, not part of the solution. If you won't do it for
yourself, do it for your neighbors who will be attacked from your
site.

He doesn't. I was at the hearings, and both Vint and Steve Crocker
from TIS were clear that the U.S. Gov't needed to lighten up, or we'd
take it in the pants from a competitive perspective, amongst other
things.

I'm afraid I must pipe up from my normally quiet mode to agree
wholeheartedly with Perry. Those who have been on the MBONE for a
while understand how brittle the whole thing is. There have been some
useful compromises like "Radio Free Vat" which gives out time slots
for people who want to DJ without having all of them set up a
full-time session. Also, RFV has a policy to yielding to conferences
and the like when they are scheduled. Please be discreet. The core movers behind the MBONE are truly gifted
people, and I'd rather have them on our side.
