Libraries have long sought to protect circulation records out of
concern for both privacy and freedom to read.
Libraries and the American Library Association have been openly

the risks of compromising your privacy outweigh these benefits.
Therefore, we are planning to purge all patron records with your
personally identifiable information on them once the materials are
returned and the fines are paid.")
What about search engines?
