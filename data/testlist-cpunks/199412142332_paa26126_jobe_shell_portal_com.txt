Ah, a refreshing sentiment ;)
There is an EXCELLENT article in this month's Scientific American
which touches upon this issue.  "Ensuring the Longevity of Digital
Documents".  It mentions how a Shakespeare sonnet written four centuries ago is
still readable.  Data stored/formatted in completly cutting edge ways
from a decade or two ago is in danger of becoming unreadable.  (8"
floppy disks, paper tape, CDC 876 mag tapes anybody?)
