If you want to land on a watch-list and maybe no-fly list, you just install it in your Chrome. Because as far as we can tell Google is in bed with the NSA and so the proprietary browser may just flag you to the system and done you are, or may forward all your messages in the clear. Who knows? Which is worst?
That's why there is not foocking way to trust proprietary software. Companies are forced to act like criminals on behalf of the government. There is no loyalty, respect, ethics, honesty or even business which the US government won't try to trample upon.
If one wants to go crypto, he goes all the way with OpenBSD, Tails, Kali, Gentoo, Firefox, Midori or even old and good Lynx, but not Chrome.
