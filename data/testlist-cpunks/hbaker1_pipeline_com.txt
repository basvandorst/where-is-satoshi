This delay-caused pilot-induced-oscillation reminds me of trying to drive
some of the simulated vehicles in current video-game environments.  The
video (and other) effects are stunning, but the experience is marred by the
delays between the controls and the perceived video.  Unlike driving a real
car at >100mph, for example, where the effects of control inputs are felt
immediately, the control inputs in videogame-simulated vehicles have a
noticeable delay.  These delays can cause uncontrollable oscillations if not
consciously damped by the gamer.
Analogously, a gamer who gets into a real car and attempts to go >100mph
will find the opposite situation -- he is expecting a delay, but instead
gets instant (and potentially disastrous) results, compounded by the real
inertia of his arms & legs interfering with any recovery effort.
