@_subject: Gripen: Risks of safety measures in military jet aircraft 
In RISKS-24.71 Paul E. Black quotes "maddogone" as saying,
  "The tests show it was the G-suit which activated the ejection. ... when
  it filled with air it pressed against the release handle"
In the early 1990's I spoke to a manufacturer of ejector-seats.  Ejection
was initiated by an upward pull on a handle positioned between the pilot's
legs.  The procedure was for the pilot to pull on the handle with the right
hand, with the left hand gripping the right wrist.  My contact explained
that this was not because the handle was particularly stiff to operate
(although it was not "hair-trigger") but in order to ensure that the pilot
took his left arm with him when he left.
Little chance of the inflation of a G-suit, or G-force alone, causing
unintentional operation in that case.  (I don't know if this applied to
specifically to the Gripen.)
With aerodynamically unstable aircraft, the situation is different.  If the
FCS goes down, the aircraft might break up within half a second or so,
depending on the airspeed and attitude, and I was given to understand that
ejection would be automatic, i.e., initiated without manual input from the
Perhaps someone familiar with the Eurofighter could supply some
authoritative information.

@_subject: N-version programming -- the errors are in ourselves 
Regarding the thread in RISKS-24.71 and 72, the results of Knight and
Leveson's famous N-version experiment show that, if any three of the
replicates from among those they had written were combined in a
two-out-of-three voting configuration, the resulting fault-tolerant system
would have a probability of failure 19 times smaller than one of the
replicates on its own.
This is not as much as fully independent failure would yield, but it is a
significant improvement.
