What an excellent example of how anonymous politcal commentary can
benefit society at large.  Quite worthy of it's status as heir to 'The
Federalist Papers'.  I look forward to reading more of your work in the

I followed your 'argument' until "w", "enforce the existing gun laws, don't
make new ones"  So apparently the currently unconstitutional laws are okay
with you?

Utah town requires all households to own gun
                  November 5, 2000
                  Web posted at: 11:22 AM EST (1622 GMT)
                  VIRGIN, Utah (AP) -- This tiny southern Utah town has enacted an ordinance
                  requiring a gun and ammunition in every home for residents' self-defense.
                  Most of Virgin's 350 residents already own firearms, so the initiative has lots of
                  support, Mayor Jay Lee said.
                  Residents had expressed fear that their Second Amendment right to bear arms
                  was under fire, so the town council modeled a similar measure passed by a
                  Georgia city about 12 years ago.
                  The mentally ill, convicted felons, conscientious objectors and people who
                  cannot afford to own a gun are exempt.

Yes, while it would be unconstitutional for the federal government to
pass this law, how could it be unconstitutional as a local or state
statute?  Something similar to requiring X number of smoke detectors per
square foot.  Additionally, it does not mention a paperwork requirement for
not owning a gun.
     While I admit it seems like a foolish law (akin to requiring a citizen
to vote), I hardly see how it would require 'a killing'.  Also, given their
views, killing them may not be as easy as others who are unarmed. ;-)

I went down to vote today, and noticed some signs for a state-wide school
bond issue ($3.1 BILLION) (NC).  The slogan was what caught my eye:
"Do it for the children" and, "It will not raise your taxes".
I didn't know whether to laugh, or cry.

Well, thank God for that!  We wouldn't want the inner workings of a
republic (such as a study to determine other uses for asparagus) to stop
due to a minor dispute about the presidency, would we?

Quick question for you: other than 'living' people, and 'dead' people,
what other kinds of people have ID?
     Perhaps you can steal mom's drivers license out of her purse when she
gives you your allowance?
