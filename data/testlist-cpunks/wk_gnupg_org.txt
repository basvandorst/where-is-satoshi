Well, there is a Free Software implementation called NewPG which
provides a backend called gpgsm - very similar to gpg.  It is
currently under development but we already exchanged encrypted
messages with proprietary implementations.  This backend will
eventually be included with gpg.  It does not yet work for Windows but
making it work won't be very difficult.
Like gpg, gpgsm does not handle the MIME encapsulation because this is
something a MUA can handle much better.  We have support for KMail and
Mutt in the works and adding it to Sylpheed will be easy.  See:
I don't suggest to use S/MIME; however in some domains (law conforming
digital signatures) there is currently no alternative for it.

That won't help unless you find a way to get random number as good as
the keysize.  The hack itself is trivial but I don't do it because
large keys are a headache for low-end machines and they trick users
into false security assumptions.  I am pretty sure that any PC or
usage of GnuPG can be broken by spending far less money.

Please add an argument for the available size of the buffer OUT and
check this length while encoding.  Over short or long someone will for

That depends on quality of the passphrase; it makes dictionary attacks
No.  The protection of the private key is is independent of the key.
They are in no way related.  The key is based on a random string and
only the protection of this key is based on the passphrase.  This
protection only helps against a lost (but protected) private key.

@_subject: SHA1 broken? 
The real problem with the breakthrough is, that it seems that they
have developed a new cryptoanalytical method and that might pave the
way for further improvements.  Over the last 2 decades the art of
cryptoanalysis has changed dramatically in the area of symmetric
ciphers.  This will probably also happen to hash algorithms now.
There is however a huge problem replace SHA-1 by something else from
now to tomorrow: Other algorithms are not as well anaylyzed and
compared against SHA-1 as for example AES to DES are; so there is no
immediate successor of SHA-1 of whom we can be sure to withstand the
possible new techniques.  Second, SHA-1 is tightly integrated in many
protocols without a fallback algorithms (OpenPGP: fingerprints, MDC,
default signature algorithm and more).

@_subject: PGP messages getting flagged as spam 
FWIW, a few weeks ago I received the first PGP signed spam.  The
signature was good and I believe that it was sent using a trojan
utilizing the local MUA which was configured to sign all outgoing mail.

@_subject: [cryptography] can the German government read PGP and ssh 
What they likely mean is traffic analysis and that for example the
Subject in mails is not encrypted.  For SSH my guess is that they were
able to break accounts by brute force password cracking.  Which is not a
surprise given that many SSH users believe that ssh automagically make
their root account save and continue to use their lame passwords instead
of using PK based authentication.
The whole thing is the usual disinformation by German secret services at
a parliamentarian investigation committee.  This committee is about
German secret services snooping on mail bleaving and entering the
countryb.  They seem to use those old Echelon like word lists (sampling
20% of all mails using a list of 16400 different words).  Nothing new
and likely a copy of what the NSA does for years.  For the fun part, we
may still be able to annoy them with spooky MIME boundaries.
