I'm not *sure* that your Assassination Politics trip is the worst piece of tripe I've ever seen on the list, but if it's not, it's right up there.
Those of us who are anarchists are often that way because we think the *means* the State uses are evil, not to be excused by any amount of mumbo-jumbo.  And you gleefully propose to let us *all* in on the immoral game of murdering those who annoy us sufficiently.
I'll pass.
You know, if I were constructing an agent provacateur, I'd want a persona who's willing to be loudly clueless with ideas that show minimal or non-existent awareness of basic human hopes and fears, like security from random hit-squads.  I'd have him go on and on with his ideas, until eventually they can splashed all over headlines and used to discredit the whole realm of privacy protection.
But no, I don't think you're an agent.  More fool you, you're willing to do the government's disinformation work for it without even thirty pieces of silver or a 401K.
At this point I recommend to you the 12-step program I explained to Vladimir.
