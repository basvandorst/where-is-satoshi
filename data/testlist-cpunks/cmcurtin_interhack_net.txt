@_subject: propose: `cypherpunks license' (Re: Wanted: Twofish source   code) 
This is really an interesting, and subtle, point.  The goals might
well be different, but I suspect they're more complementary than most
of us immediately realize.
Specifically, I'm unconvinced that letting people "steal" our code
really advances the cypherpunk goal of good crypto everywhere (GCE...a
new TLA?).  Proprietary implementations, or proprietary builds of free
or public domain might well claim to be high quality implementations
of well trusted algorithms.
But without access to the source, how do we know?
What if someone makes an RPM of PGP, for example, with a "feature" to
fire your keys off to Big Brother for "backup" and/or "safe keeping"?

The original poster didn't even quite understand the magnitude of the
problem, which I believe is quite severe.  PRIVACY has been covering
some of the issues related to this, especially in issue 07.17.
A much more detailed description of what's going on and how to manage
the problem is in our paper "`What's Related?' Everything But Your
Privacy", online at .
Netscape Communications Corporation's release of Communicator 4.06
contains a new feature, ``Smart Browsing'', controlled by a new icon
labeled What's Related , a front-end to a service that will recommend
sites that are related to the document the user is currently
viewing. The implementation of this feature raises a number of
potentially serious privacy concerns, which we have examined here.
Specifically, URLs that are visited while a user browses the web are
reported back to a server at Netscape. The logs of this data, when
used in conjunction with cookies, could be used to build extensive
dossiers of individual web users, even including their names,
addresses, and telephone numbers in some cases.
Keywords: Privacy, world-wide web (WWW), Netscape, Alexa, smart
browsing, what's related.

With all of the people running around claiming that data which are
pseudonymous are actually anonymous, it's no wonder that there's so
much confusion.
Trying to point out the property of pseudonymity and to highlight the
differences between privacy risks inherent to pseudonymous and
anonymous data is a great way to get yourself labeled a pedant, by the
way.  It never ceases to amaze me how some people will resist learning
something, even when such learning would clearly be in their interest.

Now there's an idea: using cypherpunk technology to enforce one's

was essentially advocating security through hand-waving and (a
no-archive) policy.  Whew.

  Tim> This is probably a design feature, not a bug.
Agreed.  Privacy policies aren't so much policies to protect privacy
as much as they are obscurely-phrased statements of what they're going
to do whilst being effectively immune from lawsuits.  ("You agreed to
it! You didn't opt out!")
  Tim> My recourse is to take my business elsewhere, of course.
Finding anyone in the industry who doesn't work this way is a trick.
Maybe we need a Cypherpunk Bank.

Don't give it to them.  Tell them about your concerns and they just
might find a way to deal.  Many will, if pressed, assign an alternate

@_subject: The ghost of Cypherpunks 
Slashdot has published Isaac Jones' review of my book describing how
we killed 56-bit DES, Brute Force: Cracking the Data Encryption
Standard.  The followup has been curiously devoid of mention of the
Cypherpunks, a critical force in the Crypto Wars and to whom I
dedicated the book.
  Did the Cypherpunks have their heyday and that's it?
