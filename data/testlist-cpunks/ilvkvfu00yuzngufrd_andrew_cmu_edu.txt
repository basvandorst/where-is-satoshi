@_subject: DRAFT agenda for DC net-conference in early May 
I recently saw a DRAFT agenda for a day-long Net-conference to be held
in early May, hosted by Congressmen Jack Fields and Rick White. Panels
include Future of the Internet, Electronic Commerce, Intellectual
Property, Law Enforcement and Encryption, and Education on the Net.
Highlights include a POSSIBLE luncheon address by The Honorable Newt
Thought DC-area cypherpunks might like an advance heads-up.
