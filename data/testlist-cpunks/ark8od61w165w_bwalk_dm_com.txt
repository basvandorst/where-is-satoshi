The attached summary is substantially incorrect. I know some of the
"flamers" you mentioned, and their intentions are *not* to stop the
Scientologists from discussing their religion.
On the contrary, the Scientologists are trying to make it very difficult
for anyone to *criticize* the Church of Scientology or reveal some of
its more wacky teachings.
