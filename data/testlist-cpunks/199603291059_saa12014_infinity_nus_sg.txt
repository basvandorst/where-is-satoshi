Does anyone have ANY code for DES or RSA encryption for use on a PIC
microcontroler?  A friend and I are developing an ASCII terminal (dumb term)
that encrypts data going to the serial port and decrypts data coming from
the serial port, so you could successfully send a message over a modem and
have it automatically encrypted\decrypted.  We have all the hardware almost
done, but we are having a hell of a time writing the code for the encryption...
Thanx in advance...
