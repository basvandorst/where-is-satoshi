This whole argument is getting rather weird, its topicality aside.
There are a finite number of legal positions in chess.  If any

the length of a legal chess game.  Hence the number of games is
finite, and we don't have to quibble about whether it's countably

The reason that most access providers don't charge by the packet for

You can do better than a bit-serial loop -- though not down to

one of which I remember.
Look at the problem as that of finding the sum of n 1-bit blocks.
Well, we can easily find the sum of a single n-bit block.  The
intermediate conversions are the magic part.
Let's look at an 8-bit word.  How shall we get, for example, from a
sum of 4 2-bit blocks to a sum of 2 4-bit blocks?  What we do is add
adjacent blocks.  The block-pair sums will actually fit in three
bits, so they'll certainly fit in four without overflowing.  And all
of this can be done bit-parallel using logic ops.
In C, this looks like:

Jef said:
What you're doing can be written as Note that the permutation is really a second layer of encryption, a
bit transposition cipher.  The obscurity-only approach of "
PERMUTE_KEY 0xdeadbeef" would be pretty weak.  If an opponent is to be
unable to detect images with embedded steganography (stegnant
images?) by looking for the length field, the permutation needs to
be strong: large keyspace, strong PRNG, etc.  Granted, it doesn't need to be as strong as the message cipher,
because the plaintext is lousy (mostly encrypted), the payoff to the
opponent on breaking it is less, and the target pool is much
larger.  But you do have the hassles of a second cipher -- at the
very least, you need to distribute keys.  Probably *private* keys,
with their attendant distribution explosion.
I think the Right Thing to Do is to require that the length
indication or eof marker be inside the strong encryption (Stealth
PGP or what have you).  Now, we may not want to do that.  First, we
may have good reasons to preserve modularity by doing the length in
the stegger.  If the encryption is stealthy, we can get away with
*only re-encrypting the length information*.  Big win speedwise.
If the encryption is not stealthy, it seems to me that we need
a PGP headerstripper, not a permuter.  The bulk of the file, after
all, *is* stealthy.
Tangentially, why choose bit permutation for your second-level
encryption?  There are plenty of schemes that will be a lot faster
than doing all that bitmangling.

OTP and some flavors of probabilistic encryption are information-

it a bit.  Quantum cryptography relies on the math of quantum mechanics,
whose validity is ultimately empirical but rather well tested.
My point is, invulnerability to *what attack*?  An attacker may know
the algorithm, or not; may have known plaintext; may be able to
choose plaintext; may be able to read a channel, or to garble it, or
to change it; may have limited or unlimited space and time; might be
able to factor in polynomial time -- there are a lot of parameters

this scheme is going to provoke loud complaints from most sysadmins
if it ever gets off the ground.  I agree with Karl's comments re
"havens" that it's unnecessary to look at "if the whole planet did
that, the net would implode" scenarios.  But sending encrypted
private mail to Usenet would become problematic even with light use,
a few hundred or a thousand people.  A thousand people times 50
messages per day is already 50,000 daily -- what's Usenet's daily
traffic these days?  And anon.penet.fi has more than a thousand
active users, and I get a lot more than 50 messages a day.
There are social strictures in place against broadcasting private
mail via Usenet, except possibly as a last resort.  If you encourage
people to put encrypted chunks on every system in the world so one
person can read them, you will probably be held in the same regard
as Canter and Siegel.  If you want to promote this, please don't
say anything about "cypherpunks"...

Hey, don't let him off this easily.  The administration *has* proposed
banning strong encryption.  They are now soft-pedaling this.
IMHO, the single worst aspect of `Clipper' is that it creates an
environment within which such a ban is more palatable.  "All citizens
have encryption available to them, readable only by authorized Peace
Officers.  So restrictions on non-Clipper encryption only harm child
molestors and drug kingpins.  You're not a child molestor or a drug
kingpin, are you?"

I find this a little odd, given that the "F" stands for "finite".
Checking Hopcroft and Ullman, they define an NFA formally as a
tuple: states, inputs, initial state, final states, and a mapping
from states cross inputs to 2^states.  No tape.

Interesting.  Have you tested it against the known methods for the
isomorphism problem?  Van Leeuwen* references an O(n log n)
average-case algorithm, and ones that are pseudopolynomial w.r.t.
degree, genus, and treewidth.  There are also methods based on
"signatures" (hash functions on graphs, basically); there's an O(n^2)
expected-time perfect signature, and an O(n) (worst-case?) one with
exponentially small failure rate.  These might provide attacks,
though none solve the general problem.
BTW, the graph isomorphism problem is not known to be NP-complete,
and van Leeuwen comments that there is some theoretical basis
for expecting it not to be.  Disclaimer: I don't know much about graph theory, I'm just getting
paid to do it.  :->

If I were in law enforcement, and I were faced with the problem of
getting a truename for an account like this, I'd trace back the
contact with the access provider.  No need to try to serve an
overseas subpoena; the user has to access the system somehow.  If
FBI's Big Brother Bill goes through, I can probably do this in
fifteen minutes.
There may also be problems in trying to buy blocks of anonymous
accounts, since the access provider will take the heat for anything
coming out of the account.  If Netcom is willing to drop Cashier
and Scumball, they may not be happy about this whole plan.

Maybe a telephony sort can answer this authoritatively, but I think
the phone company's logs record this information even for flat-rate
local calls.  If not, you can do almost anything with access to a
modern switch...
This may apply to some providers -- apparently not Netcom.

It's also possible that they're not doing a direct cryptanalytic
attack.  They might be using technical or human means to compromise
the key distribution, for example, or they might just have bugged
somebody's phone.  But, yeah, the bottom line is that they were able

If people feel this way, they are confused.  Once the code escapes the
U.S. it is legal to use, modulo local anti-privacy legislation.  Someone
exporting the code from the U.S. takes a legal risk; someone who uses
already-exported code does not.
Snarf it from ghost.dsi.unimi.it, as cautiously as you like.

Why?  If you XOR-split the message and encrypt each mask differently,
you are /guaranteed/ that all of the encryption methods must be
broken to retrieve the original.  If you use repeated encryption,
this is much harder to prove, and not always true.  There's a result
that if you choose the first cipher unwisely, you're hosed no matter
what you do on top of it.

It's pretty easy to screw up subtly and not know it.  Given that we're
discussing how to get encryption more secure than the KGB's best, I
think assuming that DES and IDEA's strengths combine additively, or
necessarily combine at all, is a mistake.  (They don't have to be
inverses (they clearly aren't) to be weak -- meet-in-the-middle?)
Unless there is some theory to this effect, or at least some dramatic
In any event, XOR-splitting is no less secure, and is much more
tractable theoretically.  It does require a higher-rate random source
than is needed just for key generation.  (Though if you're willing to
wager that the NSA can't factor fast, you could use the BBS PRNG)
And it requires linear ciphertext expansion.
Just to make it explicit what I'm talking about:
take your message A.  let A1=A
generate a random string X1, with |X1|=|A|.
let A1 = X1 xor A1; let A2 = X1
generate another random string, X2
let A2 = A2 xor X2; let A3 = X2
Then send (E1(A1), E2(A2), ... , En(An)), where the Ei's are distinct.
Recipient decrypts to get A1, ... An, and calculates
   A1 xor A2 xor ... xor An    Eli   ebrandt at hmc.edu

To be fair, you need to compare compressed-and-split with
