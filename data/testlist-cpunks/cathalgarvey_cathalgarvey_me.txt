The GPL doesn't require you to release a cryptosystem under the GPL,
only code for that cryptosystem that derives from GPL'd code. The GPL
in effect is a tragedy-of-the-commons-killomatic: It's an agreement
between me and you saying "I give you my code, if you give it to
others". There's nothing in there about "I offer you my code, and hit
you if you try to write your own instead".
Given that, I have very little time for GPL-haters, because they're
just being whiny bastards. Write your own if you don't like it.
Patents, on the other hand, are a whole different steaming pile of
shit, and NTRU is patented. So, I'm still with you on this one. If
they're somewhere where you can relinquish patents, they should do
that. If not, they should either grant the patents wholly to a public
trust, or put them under the DPL or similar and make an irrevocable
pledge never to use them except defensively, if even that.
Of course, who's to know if you implement or build on NTRU under a
'nym? It remains one of the only cryptosystems that's A) Practical and
B) Quantum-resistant.
Anyone know of any other quantum-resistant algos for *encryption* that
can actually be used today, other than NTRU?

IDD, I've searched for an Android API for detecting crypto algo for ages and turned up empty. However, you can get the tower ID, so a distributed, communally (cantenna?) verified whitelist of 'good' towers is doable, with automatic disconnection if an unwhitelisted tower connects..?
Can/do IMSI systems spoof tower id: is there anything in GSM to make towers self-verifying? I'm guessing no, in which the above would be very poor.
Also of note is API for signal strength, so a mapping of known towers to expected strength at location XYZ could be used to detect systems used to home in on phones, which usually max out on signal and tell your phone to do likewise. Indeed, a strong signal tower which still asks your phone to dial up the juice should be regarded as an attack.

(preamble: I'm not a libertarian, and I'm all for statist solutions to
actual _res publica_: things in the commons that are the responsability
of nobody in particular but to the benefit of everyone. I just don't
think patents solve a problem that actually exists or needs fixing.)
What's wrong with the voluntary-ist system, to me, is subtle. On the
face, it seems great; abolish "patents" as such and let people
patronise systems that certify patents and inventor-hood.
What I see as being wrong here is that without certification, people
essentially tend to do this already, and when they don't you can't win
them over anyway. This is the "Piracy is good" argument; someone who
would ever have been a customer anyway if given the opportunity not to
be, will generally be, and those who won't be customers if they can
avoid being customers will never or rarely be.
To put that bluntly; people will choose the product of an inventor
if it's not-shit and fairly priced/available. If they don't, it's
either a great idea compromised by stupid design, or it's crippled by
price or availability. People like to patronise the creators of good
things; we have the success of things like flattr and gittip to show
for that online, and the full caps of buskers worldwide in meatspace.
People buy products all the time that are generally shittier than the
competition because they have a brand name on them that people either
like or associate with status; take Apple as a key example.
This is the argument behind the Pirate Party movement's general
agreement that trademarks are a net benefit to creativity whereas
patents and most aspects of copyright are merely a tax on creativity.
It's more important to know who created something than to allocate a
monopoly to that person over the outputs of their creativity.
Coming back to the voluntarist system, while there's nothing outwardly
wrong about it, I think it would appear to "work" inasmuch as people
would buy from the inventors, but not because of certifying bodies and
voluntarist cartels. It would work because that's what people would do
anyway given a robust way to know where to attribute their gratitude
and patronage for a thing well-invented.
So I suggest rather than a cartel, that the certification bodies do
*only* that, and not enforce something on the purchase and sale of
products outside of that role. They should provide a way for people to
see who is generally believed to have created a good thing (whether
music, products, services or code), and provide certification platforms
for people to trust that they're delivering credit and money the right
way, and then butt out and let people get on with free association,
trade and communication.
I personally believe that in such a system, if an inventor loses out to
competition for a thing well-made, it's either because the final
product created by the otherwise bright inventor sucks, or it's an edge
case where the costs of development remain high (the justification
given for creating patents, though not the real reason they were
introduced). In such cases, there are much better (usually statist!)
methods of encouraging inventors to invent than creating a
state-enforced monopoly on production and sale of derived products,
such as research grants and/or start-up investment programmes.

Your examples suggest you're referring to that article that alleged
dictionary attacks can crack 90% of hashed database passwords offline in
4 hours, right? Can't remember the site. They neglected to say they
were dealing with unsalted md5 hashes.
A password of good length, stored using a *password hash*, is pretty
secure against attack. 'Good length' here is 20 characters or more, if
you ask me..but the "true" entropy of a passphrase is not merely the
length or character value, but number of words. So a 4-word
20-character passphrase is probably slightly weaker than a 5-word one,
because pattern-based or markov-based brute-forcers may have an easier
time working through 4-character passphrases.
All speculation, but still. A password hash that is uniquely salted
forces an attacker to brute force every possible password again for
each attacked password. A password hashed with a scheme like scrypt or
pbkdf2 can require a second or more per password hashing attempt. The
entropy of a password becomes infinitely less limiting to security when
each hashing attempt takes longer than iterating over a dictionary!
For extra points, you could probably hack up something to dissociate a
password hash from the account on the server database side, so an
attacker getting the database can't even specifically target a
particular high-value user.
There are JS libs out there for PBKDF2 and SCRYPT, and salts can be
uniquely assigned trivially. Site owners can check passwords at
sign-up time against a list of known passwords in bruteforce
dictionaries. There are probably libraries to check and enforce decent
passwords (as in, length and proportionate variability of character use,
not stupid overcomplexity), and if not then they'd be fairly easy to
hack up.
All of which means this: the problem we have today isn't that passwords
suck (although there is a minimum practical length you should enforce).
It's that the people providing the password have no control over the
security policy of the site owners, and site owners think password
security is something you enforce on users (no vowels! Pray to Slaanesh
whilst entering your passwords or face account deletion!) and that you
can store plains or unsalted md5s on your syndicated hipster blogging
platform and sleep untroubled.

If you could be assured of client-side salted-JS-hashing of the password
prior to submitting it to the server, then you could in principal use
the same password everywhere.
This used to be the norm, but SSL made it easier first to store plains,
and for (as the security concerns of break-ins became apparent) to
store server-generated hashes. Yet many, perhaps most, services don't
do their job correctly on the server-side. If it were still done
client-side, a savvy user could make sure hashing were done correctly,
and salted appropriately.
Ideally yes we'd all use unique certs for everything, but then we'd be
tied to our particular browsers.
You could make this work with a well-implemented browser sync agent,
but what about users of pathetic platforms that don't support
trustworthy browsers (iPhone, Nokia)?

Retroshare isn't "like tor", it's "the opposite of tor".
Tor establishes a network of mutual distrust (kinda; you still trust
some aspects of the network such as the directory servers).
Retroshare establishes a network of mutual trust, although you can
withhold certain details such as whether you or merely a friend known
to you is sharing the files you make available (although as mentioned
by another this is likely to be traceable with enough network data).
For high-security work, something like i2p or Tor is probably better.
For an alternative to daily, casual internet traffic, Retroshare's
*idea* is probably superior; by relying on existing relationships of
trust, you can probably get better performance, and data that's
relevant to your interests is likely to be nearby in the network
because of social networking effects.
However, the flipside is without existing relationships of trust,
you're dead in the water; I tried Retroshare for a while but had no
friends on it, so had no access to the "core network" through any
trusted links.
Also, I get mixed signals about the developer attitude to some security
aspects of the P2P side of things. For example, they use SHA1 for the
distributed hash table, whereas in my opinion one should never use an
even partially broken hash for a *hash table*; you never know what
exploits are known privately that further break the hash, and should
generally assume it's fully broken if your threat model includes
adversaries like the NSA. If you're willing to compromise on the
quality of the hash that underlies the entire P2P end of the system,
I'm wary about your attitude to security overall.
This wasn't such a big deal 'til I saw some anons advocating Retroshare
as a "usable crypto" solution. Well, it is; if your adversary is a
talent-starved rent-seeking quango like the RIAA. If your adversary is
the world's biggest circle-jerk of military cryptographers, I wouldn't
go there, personally.
Maybe I'm paranoid about SHA1? I'm eager for other opinions here.
Crypto is an area where the Dunning Kruger only gets worse the deeper

That's one way to screw with the "no filesharing" ban in Tor, which has
positive and negative consequences.
I do like the idea of layering a network of pseudonymous trust over the
Tor layer of mutual distrust, but is that not horrendously slow?
This sounds like i2p; a P2P networking layer for applications that need
not be routing-aware? Although again; i2p creates a system of mutual
distrust whereas Retroshare assumes mutual trust. The advantages and
disadvantages of either depend on entirely social factors that are hard
to model (see [Cryptography][Law] thread on range of estimates
regarding rat-content of hacker community), so as far as the philosophy
I'm not prepared to call.
Certainly it's easier to establish a route using Tor/i2p than with
Retroshare, and it's doubtful you could have true anonymity if your
friends can see when you're online and correlate with activities of
public identities they may notice through shared interests. But then,
that's not what Retroshare is for; it's for creating networks for
social and personal use.

Well, the DHT is (if I recall correctly!) used not only for locating
peers for but locating files. So, for example imagine the case where an
update to Retroshare is offered from within the network: the retroshare
devs themselves estimated that to forge a malicious hash would take
weeks on consumer end hardware, and therefore that it was an
impractical attack not worthy of threat modelling.
Leaving aside the fact that your real adversary does *not have to
constrain itself to consumer end hardware*, it's the first time I've
encountered a "serious" crypto project that considers *weeks* to be
"computationally infeasible".
This is all ignoring the fact that SHA1 was built by the NSA.
Specifically (correct me if I'm mistaken): SHA0 was based on MD5, and
SHA1 was then proposed soon after as its replacement by the NSA after
some alterations to correct *undisclosed vulnerabilities*. Ahem.
So, AFAIK RS is using a hash function redesigned (for all intents and
purposes) in secret by *the adversary* which has plenty of publicly
known attacks and may well have a critical in-built attack, and relies
on this hash to route to the correct file or peer.
Once you have a peer's keys, you can keep them and trust-on-first-use,
and RS *probably* (anyone wanna check source?) uses and checks
signatures thereafter, but if the signatures are based on a SHA1 hash
you're back to square one, where a forged hash will fit a valid

Tokens are a clever way to solve a specific problem; when you sign up
for a VPN service, whether with credit card or bitcoin, the service
knows that *one person* has just signed up, and *this person* is the
one using the secrets and settings provided to allow access to the
Tokens are transferable, and transferring tokens is encouraged. This
means that when I buy a token, the service cannot know for sure whether
I am the one using them later on, or someone I've given them to or sold
them to.
However: The VPN provider still knows that *this IP address with this
configuration of settings and this operating system (+version) is using
this browser to connect to these sites at these times*. In other words,
the actual identities of users are still very much in the clear to the
VPN provider if no other steps are taken; tokens just make it harder to
correlate these users with the payment information provided, and can
potentially allow many users in the same city (who may be NAT'd
together at the public-IP level) to achieve increased anonymity by
mixing their traffic.
You can make things much more secure (I think?) by chaining VPNs,
because now the first VPN knows your public IP address, and the second
knows your traffic, but neither knows both unless they collude.
However, both probably still can infer a lot by your OS/Browser/Access
times/traffic volume, etc.

Methinks you are conflating "elected representation" with "democracy". Election of tenured representatives is only one (failure) mode of democracy, one so terrible the old Athenians likened to oligarchy.
Other modes exist: some have been extensively stress tested, such as sortition (Athens). Others haven't seen as much testing because they aren't really possible to implement without modern networking, and even so require very careful implementation, such as liquid/direct democracy without tenure.
Saying "democracy doesn't work" is meaningless. Democracy means, in ideal, "rule by the governed". If your examples don't fit that criteria, they're not really democracies, just as the USSR wasn't really socialism, England isn't really monarchism, and The Republic of Ireland (not currently concerning itself with matters of the res publica/ public interest) isn't really a Republic.

Check out firegloves. It's outdated, and I'd love to see it getting

Still works with Iceweasel 20, so it's aged well for an apparently
unmaintained academic project. Among the key features; a restricted set
of fonts sent to sites, possibly including cycling the fonts randomly
to confuse fingerprinting by recurrent font-lists.
Note though, it breaks some websites in a manner akin to
fascist-maxima-noscript. So you'll sometimes need to disable it; Paypal
is a good example.
User-agents are the devil, though, because whatever about other sources
of browser entropy, the User Agent is a big honking bonus score every
site gets for zero effort. Worse, most efforts to minimise User-Agents
can end up maximising them instead, and there don't seem to be any
*current* lists of "most common user-agent string" to work from to
reduce entropy. I've set mine to a super-generic-looking
Windows/Firefox setting, but as other people upgrade their browsers and
OSes and as architectures get more diverse, browser UAs are getting
more and more diverse, too..

This all seems a bit backwards, though. Wasn't the whole idea of
browser rendering that the server would send one canonical page to the
client, and the client is responsible for rendering? Our browsers
shouldn't even be telling the server their dimensions, CPUs and OSes;

Funny, I was just reading about restitutionary justice this morning.
Reminded me of a longstanding thought process indicting "retributionary
justice" for many of the failing in our societal system. That is, we
punish people for things, expecting that the threat of punishment, or
the experience of punishment, will prevent crime. But, it doesn't, at
Assassination politics is just extreme retributionary justice. It's a
lipstick-on-a-pig rebranding that's easy to sell to crypto-enthusiasts;
"Look, we can use crypto to solve all societal problems, including
keeping politicians honest!". To some extent it might, but it certainly
wouldn't solve the problem as well as, er, most viable alternatives.
It'll just breed a generation of smarter crooked politicians.

People focus too much on the "profit" miners make, and not the
verifiability and anarchism they are supposed to be providing to the
bitcoin network. In that regard, arguably the most important, bitcoin
has already failed entirely.
Of course, bitcoin is a startlingly obvious example of code with
politics baked in, and you're seeing the natural play-out of that
political philosophy in bitcoin with little artificial interruption;
corruption, oligarchy, and the creation of a false market controlled by
monopolistic cartels which fluctuates in price only when it is
profitable to the cartels for it to do so.
Much of this is beyond the control of an algorithm. The wealthy will
always be able to out-mine the poor if it's a straight battle of
who-buys-more-hardware. However, bitcoin has fallen so quickly because
it's created a threshold cut-off for those below a certain income
bracket, so that those who are not already reasonably wealthy can now
not hope to compete in mining operations.
Litecoin was doing better while it was CPU-bound, because the cost of
setting up a mining operation on CPUs is more linear; the poor get poor
hardware, the rich get rich hardware, but the relationship isn't as
exponential as it is with CPU->GPU->FPGA->ASIC. Now that Litecoin's
basically GPU only, it's also a little worse than it started, but
there's no evidence at this point that it'll go FPGA.
However, I do think we need an even Lite-r 'coin, running a hash that
won't even scale in GPUs. Keep this to the unit of hardware that's most
scalar in quality/price and most accessible to the people who most need
to trust a currency; the people spending the greatest proportion of
their income in daily life, the middle and lower income fraction. I'm
interested in the outcome of the password hashing competition to see if
this yields something 'coinable.
My ideal hash for a 'coin, unrealistic as it is even in theory, is a
hash that practically defines the instruction set and architecture of a
prototypical CPU, so that translating it into specialised hardware is
either impossible, or merely creates a more efficient CPU, which is
better marketed as a CPU than a mining rig. In other words, the
state-of-the-art in CPUs is exactly the state-of-the-art in CPUcoin
mining. :)

Not so; mining is what fixes the history of transactions and protects
the integrity of the entire currency. If you can out-mine everyone
else, by even a small margin, you can rewrite recent history in
bitcoin, selectively permit transactions between other peers, cause
general havoc. The reward for mining was the bootstrap, but mining
itself is a critical part of what makes bitcoin work.
And this part is principally what's broken, because it uses a
hardware-optimisible hash.
I'll happily use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange in the same way I
would any currency. I just think we need to grow up and look at the
project critically; has it met its goals? No. Then like good engineers,
try again.
Bitcoin was supposed to be different:
1) It was supposed to be outside the control of any individual or
group. This is obviously failed, as mining pools have actually had to
voluntarily stop growing in order to not pass the 50% margin of
dominance over the mining pool.
2) It was supposed to be scaleable by individuals to prevent monopoly;
the old myth "if anyone looks like they'll become dominant, we'll all
fire up mining rigs and stop them!"-> does this look realistic anymore?
3) It was supposed to be a "free market currency" obeying simple supply
and demand, but there is evidence of price fixing and market
manipulation by those with enough money to pump and dump the currency
when it suits them.
4) It was supposed to be untraceable, but for architectural and simple
network-analysis reasons, it's not untraceable to a large enough
opponent. If you ask me, this is the reason the NSA hasn't just fired
up its sha256 brute-forcing rigs to out-mine everyone and destroy the
There are areas where bitcoin has succeeded. It's offering a real
alternative to credit cards and conventional banking online, and that's
great. But the political, architectural and privacy goals are a flop,
and the mining pools who control bitcoin at this point won't back the
developers if they try to fix the architecture. It's deadlocked; it
needs replacing. And, as big and awesome as bitcoin is, nobody should
every have expected us to get P2P anarchic crypto-currency right the
first time.

So what functions of Javascript are nonessential to the concept of a
"rich webapp" but useful for abuse and fingerprinting? If you could
strip JS down to a set of awesome functions that reduce the abuse
potential, what stuff would you strip out?
A lot of the nasty stuff isn't even JS engine stuff, it's DOM stuff

This is a very good point, but for one big glaring reason I disagree;
the costs of actually fabricating mining chips of your own design is a
capital-intensive process.
Plus, given that you're *designing equipment to print money* in effect,
you would only have a good reason to sell it if it wasn't worth the
price, right? Unless you're idealistic and good-natured.
The reason CPUs are great is because they already have market
saturation; anyone can go and buy a CPU tomorrow for as low a capital
input as you're likely to accomplish in this area. Not so for FPGAs or
I'll accept GPUs as a close-runner-up; although also available widely
like CPUs, they're harder to set up than just running an application on
your PC. I'm looking not at the profitability angle, remember, but the
anarchism angle. How can we make a 'coin where, if someone looks about
to accomplish dominance, we can all fire up the daemon and prevent it?
In bitcoin, that's not even remotely possible. Even if we all had the
cash, there's an ASIC bottleneck, and the relationship of
hash-power/cost isn't linear enough to permit us to collectively
overthrow a wealthier opponent. His €10,000 gets better hardware than 10
* €1,000 does.
So yea, Litecoin's nearly there. Maybe we can make a CPU-hash, maybe
not. But at least we can make a hash that either guarantees GPU-only
for a few years, or one that's hardcoded to match Moore's Law so it'll
always stay ahead of the curve (bearing in mind Bunnie's plausible
suggestion that Moore's Law is levelling off:

Well, I'm no singulatarian, but I do think it's naive to expect
something as complex and immutable as a block-chain based currency of
*any design* to last longer than a decade (or even half that) these
days, before needing replacement. What you should aim for is relative
stability in that term, not the "long term", so that you can transition
gently to updated 'coins as they emerge to tackle new technology.
Thankfully we do generally get good advance notice of new technologies.
We know that there's progress in Quantum, but we know its not there
yet. We know there are proof of concept DNA computers, but for now
there's no conceivable architecture for a general-purpose DNA computer;
each must be built for the mathematical task to hand (although that
doesn't rule out a mental genius creating a sha256-hashing DNA computer
and brute-forcing through nigh-infinite parallelism).
So; design your coins to last as long as they're likely to last. Don't
expect or desire them to outlast that. Given the leverage a currency
has on an economy, you could even regard a new 'coin as a "budget plan"
for the next few years, though god help you if you get it wrong. :)

ionise an air path to a detector. You might be able to use the voltage
variation in that circuit with very little modification, without even
opening the case perhaps (which is good, because Americanium is

I've found a few since, too; some I could build right away.
Leading to a n00b question: if you have a custom-built HWRNG, and you
*don't need the full output* but just a complementary source of entropy
for /dev/random, how would one seed /dev/random with the HWRNG without
washing out the good entropy already in /dev/random?
That is, I gather some CSPRNGs can consider relative weights of RNG
inputs, seeding the pool more often from some than others, or
sanitising some inputs more than other. So my custom-built HWRNG, with
possibly not-trustworthy output for crypto usages, would be a nice
ancillary input to /dev/random if I could be sure it would be only used
to supplement, never to replace, more proven and trustworthy sources.
Bonus question; if I take the direct output of my HWRNG, and use it
with a hash function and a long, random seed that is invariant, that
should even out the bits of output and help account for fluctuations in
true entropy, right?
That is:
mypassphrase = SHA512(b'some long string of high-entropy seed data')
entropy = HWRNG_READ(64)
entropy = SHA512(entropy, mypassphrase)

Hey all,
Am mulling over a federated datastore for zero-knowledge web applications, using hashcash as a "commitment" price for otherwise gratis data storage. All very straightforward, but:
Zero knowledge is as much for host protection as client protection. Hosts don't WANT plaintext.
Short of stupidly CPU-intensive stuff like letter counting, UTF8 decoding, etc, how might a server verify it's receiving encrypted data?

In case anyone else was wondering, I answered my own question, although
I have yet to learn whether this is efficient for large files. The
answer so far appears to be libmagic, bindings for which in Python are
available as "filemagic". Can then be used like so:
-> import ssl, magic
-> M = magic.Magic()
-> M.id_buffer(ssl.RAND_bytes(50))
:: 'data'
-> M.id_buffer("This is text, plain and simple")
:: 'ASCII text, with no line terminators'
-> M.id_buffer("This is text, plain and simple\nand it has more than one
-> line")
:: 'ASCII text'
-> M.id_buffer(rand)
:: 'data'
-> M.close()
(For anyone who's read the docs, yes you're supposed to use a context
manager with filemagic, and no it doesn't work on Py3.3 near as I can
So I'll run with this if nobody has better ideas; user submits data, if
it returns "data" on a check with filemagic/libmagic, it's considered
encrypted (because encrypted data should be indistinguishable from
random data), otherwise it's rejected.

If the particle flux is high enough for it to be usefully rich in random
data, you could just hash the image output and use the hash outputs as
an entropy source.
However, you'd want to be careful that you:
A) Use a good hash, and perhaps double-hash to be paranoid
B) Try to measure and correct/alarm for the flux of your radioisotope as
it decays, though depending on the isotope perhaps this isn't important.
Thinking all the thoughts on this channel through, I'm beginning to
wonder if the easiest answer isn't just a vibrating surface covered in

I'm not an expert on compiled languages by any stretch, but my 2c:
A) Dlang is designed to be memory safe, has a close syntax to C and is
easily interfaced with it. It's garbage-collected but you can disable
that, as well as all other safety guarantees, if you choose. There are
working bindings for Lua, so you can implement a scripting backend
easily. It's multi-paradigm, with room for OOP, struct-based or
functional, or whatever. It doesn't have much builtin crypto but can be
linked to C crypto.
B) Rust is designed as a memory-safe systems language and looks really
nice as a replacement for C, but I get the impression that (like Golang)
it's "too" strict and may get in the way of some low-level work. It also
has Lua bindings but I don't know how mature they are. I don't think
it's garbage collected which adds a bit of work to the securing part of
the job. I don't know about crypto support.
C) Golang is memory safe and bounds-checked, and garbage-collected, but
unlike Dlang lacks scripting bindings AFAIK, and is "too" strict. It's
not multi-paradigm, perhaps too stuck in the "Look like C" mud.
Personally, I don't like or recommend Golang, but I mention it because
unlike the above, it has *excellent* crypto-support in an external, but
officially supported, library set.
..and then there's scripting languages, which (if written correctly) can
be competitive on speed, benefit from JIT, and have the large advantage
of not requiring compilation prior to use. That means, not worrying
about deterministic builds, because the source is the program. Of these,
Python and Lua are the only ones I'd consider; former is mature,
powerful, and has huge library support. The latter is barebones and
would need additional libraries to work, but if you stick to the
somewhat outdated Lua 5.1 you can use LuaJIT which is considered the
fastest scripting language out there, faster even than some compiled
languages. Python does have PyPy, but it's such a nightmare to compile

A less controversial reading of the (US Govt Money) >>= Tor "thing" is
that, while the Tor devs may be doing their best, Tor is ultimately an
asset to the US Intelligence apparatus rather than a liability. That is,
perhaps they haven't convinced the Tor devs to insert backdoors in
anything, but Tor remains something that helpfully concentrates
dissidents while not overly inhibiting the government's ability to round
them up and imprison them when needed.
Part of this is plausible because endpoint security; 'nuff said,
especially as JS is enabled by default in the TBB.
Part of this is plausible because there are plenty of NSA docs in the
wild suggesting that while they can't anonymise everyone at once, they
also don't feel the need to as they can usually anonymise the subset
they care about eventually.
While the Tor devs seem to have a callous disregard for this line of
inquiry (which in itself is worrying), to me it's a healthy thing to
bear in mind. The bottom line is that we're dealing with a piece of
software that purports to blind the world's biggest and most politically
powerful surveillance state, yet receives virtually all of its funding
from that same surveillance state.
Draw your own conclusions based on a weighting of (ability of
individuals to hide traffic from the state) / (ability of the state to
obfuscate intelligence traffic) and taking into consideration how much
smaller the threat model is for a state apparatus with known trusted
servers and alternative traffic routes through compromised botnets and

Quite right! Good job I didn't say that, then.
I said, rather, that a combination of NSA docs, US government funding,
and the Tor project's own admission that an adversary with sufficient
ability to track and correlate traffic, means that Tor is not likely to
be sufficient against that particular adversary; the US National
Security Infrastructure.
There's nuance in there, of course. The FBI for example are pretty low
on the rungs, and won't get all the Tor-killing toys from the NSA unless
it suits the NSA. The CIA are more likely to get that access or may have
it in-house, but they'll shoot you in your bed rather than make a trial
and reveal their tricks.
Against other governments, whose exit nodes the Tor project don't
explicitly bless in the directory server(s), Tor is likely to be more
valuable. So I'd recommend Tor to a person in China or Iran because,
although both nations also have excellent anti-speech infrastructure,
the structural issues that make me wary of Tor are mostly US centric.

Routing approach, and something I'm tempted to think recommends i2p's
"Garlic Routing" as a better avenue for research. As all i2p nodes are
by default routing traffic for others, and nodes can be configured to
vary their tunnel length, correlating traffic becomes (AFAIK) far more
difficult even for a top-down adversary. Code i2p up in a safe, portable
and vertically integrated way without untrusted, unsigned code execution
(Javascript) and I'm sold.

References: <20140721162504.GX26986
For those who aren't so keen on JS crypto even when implemented as an
extension (or for those who, like me, think of Chromium as gussied up
spyware), I re-implemeted miniLock in Python and released it today on
Github and PyPI:
I added a few features, some of which are only partially implemented.
For one thing, the most secure feature of miniLock, that your key is not
stored but always generated from memory, is now optional for the
YOLO/lazy crowd; you can optionally generate a plaintext copy of your
key and use it to encrypt and decrypt. More practically, there's a
petnames system so you can store and name IDs for other people, and then
encrypt to the petnames.
Also partially implemented but not from the terminal interface is a
means to try and brute-force a prefixed or suffixed ID, though it's not
parallelised yet; I need to learn more about the multiprocess module
first. This is for "vanity" addresses, like one beginning with "cathal",
but lacking the hardware I'd need to accomplish that myself it's just
there because I could write it rather than by true aspiration.
Another handy feature; if you direct deadlock to encrypt a directory, it
will automatically zip the directory and encrypt the zipfile. Recipients
must still manually unzip the files; no way am I opening up that
security bug in my code!
Thoughts, feedback, flames etc. welcome. Unless you're bitching about
lack of explicit WinMac support; that's entirely your problem to figure
out. :)

While I'm happy to see my own work in an august list like that, I'd just
like to point out that saying anything based on NaCl is "basically the
same thing" is like accusing any scheme using sha256 and aes256
primitives of being the "same thing". If the schemes are not compatible
or close to compatible, if they have different threat models or
implementations, or different intended use-cases, they can hardly be
called the same thing.
Now, miniLock format could be used as a PGP alternative, and I'd be
interested in making deadlock suitable for hooking into mail clients
that can preprocess incoming or outgoing mail with user-configured
scripts so it could be used as such, but I don't think it wasn't written
for that (ask Nadim his intended use-case for miniLock, I guess).
So, while all of those are NaCl based, I'd say only miniLock and
deadlock are "essentially the same thing" because they're
implementations of the same protocol and basic use-case.

some global awakening where we all sing together and agree on
everything, obviating the need for social norms of any description.

So, if I understand this right;
x and k are pairs of 32-bit numbers, as Red Pike is a 64-bit block
system and 32 is the maximum int size on most platforms.
k is key material, x is a pointer to the data.
No state is preserved when encrypting x with k, so to encrypt lots of
data, you must string it into a series of "x" and apply the cipher to
each block.
Am I mistaken? Is this any better than AES-ECB, then, if no cipher state
is preserved between encrypted blocks?

Was it not in vogue during Crypto Wars 1.0 to promulgate ciphers with a
keystrength that was feasible for big-crypto to smash but not the peasantry?
If I'm reading you correctly, this cipher has less than 64 bits of
security, more than DES at time of release. But, were attacks on this
type of cipher known at the time it was written, which could be used to
lower the effective strength for those "in the know"?
Of course now I'd expect that a look around would find plenty of attacks
on this cipher family. I'm just curious as to whether GCHQ were
spreading a secret cipher algorithm to which they probably already had a
set of good attacks at the time.

But he'd have been a felon, then. And unable to participate meaningfully
in politics from "the inside", which I gather to have been his ultimate
mission. Aaron was the ultimate white-knight, he wanted to go all the
way to the White House and fix things from the inside.
Of course, he'd have failed; systems like this aren't constructed, they
*evolve* by surviving many white knights and adapting to them. Part of
the defense system (according to my pet theory of
corrupt-state-evolution) of a long-lived corruption is "wayside
tempatations" in the form of seemingly unbelievable illegalities that
are trivially assaulted on their basis, but which in so doing
permanently remove someone from the establishment.
In other words, as white knights rise through the system, they are
increasingly tempted to use their expanding power and influence to
attack problems within their reach, but when they do so they are picked
off from the ladder of power, leaving their carefree sociopathic
brethren to rise to power.
In Aaron's case, he saw copyright and privatisation of publicly funded
research as anathema, which of course it is. And being at that point of
some power and influence for his tier of political clout, he felt he
could use his academic ties to cover for his "Open Access Manifesto". In
fact, he probably could have done, if MIT stood with him and referred to
his work as research; I imagine he was surprised that they didn't.
Other "wayside temptations" are things like criminalisation of piracy,
drug war, institutional racism, censorship, surveillance, tax evasion by
the wealthy and overtaxation of the poor. All of these and more are
issues that, if addressed directly by a rising star, can either lead to
felonies or criminalities, or merely an avenue by which to strip a
person of their political viability by PR assault.
To read several accounts by those who knew him well, it appears to me
that Aaron wasn't trying to escape a long-or-short prison term, but the
loss of any chance to pursue his dream of political reform through the
supposedly-legitimate, electionary route.

I've been considering this. We all still link, and link richly and
often. It's just that our links no longer take the form of a dedicated
"link index" as they did in the nineties, and are now more often either
inline or colon-ised; either "I just found a [great resource on
whatever]" or "I just found a great resource on whatever: [link]". The
former is more common on blogs, the latter on twitter.
So, to take your idea. An index based on your web browsing habits is, I
feel, not so useful, because we all often follow links to stuff that's
not generally interesting to us, often by anonymous links (2 girls one
kitteh). So the index would be populated with lots of spurious stuff
that'd be forward-indexed and made into nonsense. You type "girls" and
kitteh-scat-porn comes up. :)
However, there's another type of index that at least some of us engage
in that's more likely to be relevant; RSS/Atom feeds, and Microstatus
feeds. The former is interest-based, the latter social-based. By
scanning the stuff we explicitly subscribe to and indexing ahead, we not
only get a curated source by which to infer "trusted" metadata (i.e. if
we follow a medical blog and it links to viagra, we know it's not a
spammer but a trusted person recommending a link), but the links
themselves are likely to be related to our interests.
By then publishing our indexes along with our blogs or microstatus feeds
(borrow an XML callback system from the fairly Byzantine status.net
standard and publish it in your post headers/about me block), we also
get "trusted" access to a web of our friends, follows and favourite
blogs by which to form a social search engine.
This has several advantages. For one thing, the social/subscription web
can be used to infer relative trust. If you follow a person who
recommends a link and several people you know also follow and trust that
person's links, then that link may be given more relative "trust" than
an outlier that only you follow.
So, that seems pretty pie in the sky, right? A standard rather than a
codebase. But there's a huge advantage to this line of thought, if
you'll bear with me. A two-digit fraction of the web right now is
powered by Wordpress.org, who explicitly advocate open/free culture. If
you can convince them to include a social search/index standard of this
type, which is virtually free in terms of computer resources, then you'd
have it deployed across the web in days as the next update rolled out.
Indeed, even if Wordpress seemed reluctant, a wordpress plugin could
probably be written quickly enough to enable such a thing and make it
available for casual use. Suddenly, a bunch of PHP-powered sites around
the web start committing small bits and pieces of resources to a social
search engine based on human-curated attestations of trust that flow
through a web, helping to confine spammers to the fringes and to users
with stupid taste.
Also worthy of consideration is Jekyll, though that's a static site so
index compilation would be more costly per-publication (you'd have to
recompile with each blogpost) and there's no scope for an active
callback where readers can suggest index additions back.
Thoughts welcome, I don't even code PHP so it's all speculation here. :)

So you're running a server, you want logs. Fine; what do you need to

to record who they are; hash the IPs with a salt. Sure, yes, I expect
you can reverse IP hashes, but at least you're trying.

I immediately thought, not of active injection of code/devices, but
passive reading of data as a surveillance mechanism. If HVAC was
advanced enough, for example, then you could use HVAC sensor data to
infer location of individuals within a large building by the changes in
airflow required to maintain temperature or humidity. Same for
electrical use if they use devices. Hell, if the system is shit-hot
enough, you might even be able to detect electrical fluctuations due to
capacitance induced by passing foot traffic.
Given that the NSA apparently don't like deploying code when passive
observation will suffice, might be a fruitful avenue of investigation if
anyone here knows their HVAC/other-hardware control systems..

I think the reasoning with Snowden was not so much to brag as to make
himself a hard-to-assassinate public figure. In his case, so few people
could have acquired the documents he did, that it was a matter of
(little) time before he was noticed to be conveniently absent as the
shit hit the fan.
If he wasn't in the public eye by that time, he'd have been disappeared
and/or shot in short order.
Funny that, I look at closed source as evidence of deception; without
deception, there is no reason to hide the source. As long as they keys
are secret, the protocol and code can be open, and should be if anyone's
to trust that they're A) beneficent and B) competent.
In the comparison of Cryptocat, which has tightened up radically because
of code audits enabled by Open Sourcing it, to Bittorrent Sync (which
used to advertise AES256 which was impossible with the keylength being
shared, now advertises AES128, nobody knows how they implement it but a
mistake like that screams "badly"), which is still unaudited snakeoil:
BTSync boast massive bandwidth usage implying a significant user uptake,
and moreso since the Snowden affair because of their snakeoil offering.
So the Open Source guy gets all the attention, audits and improvement,
while the closed source guys get no attention, no audits, and finally
notice internally that they're offering AES256 when they can't
physically accomplish it with the keylengths.
I'll take Open, thanks. At least I can see what's wrong if it errs.

Back on topic, I'm not sure that it's possible to achieve low-latency

VoiP. Tor is already pushing the boundaries of low-latency mixing with
an asynchronous protocol that doesn't *require* perfect synchrony, such
as would be required of VoiP. So you might have to sacrifice obfuscation

I may reveal some crippling ignorance, but:
UTF8 is an encoding system to allow for effectively infinite character
extensions in binary text data. The original forms of binary encoding
for text were merely to assign characters to a large segment of the 264
possibilities of a single byte; 2^8.
To account for the fact that in early data transports many of these
codepoints were considered instructions and could therefore inject
transport-specific commands etc. (if I understand the problem
correctly)*, base64/base32 were intended to allow arbitrary binary to be
encoded into a transport that accepted text without including codepoints
likely to have control significance. Amusingly, the base32/64 alphabets
are restricted further to remove characters that might, if accidentally
rearranged, cause people to see naughty words in binary.
When it comes down to it, there are only 2^8 possibilities in binary.
UTF8's extensions are indicated by additional byte sequences that
indicate "the following bytes should be viewed as an extension". I'm not
sure how many "ensuing" bytes can be regarded as an extended encoding at
a time, but I think it's only in the range of 1-3.
If we assume it's 3, and further assume that, after declaring that the
following 3 bytes are an extension, that any arbitrary binary sequence
will be interpreted as a visible, copy/pasteable character, then you're
looking at a length penalty to encode arbitrary data of 33%. For every
three bytes, you're escaping them to random characters by prefixing with
another byte.
Yes, it's more nuanced than that; you can factor in the ascii set and
use that where possible, only escaping binary values outside the ascii
set, but one way or another you're adding length to the binary string by
messing with it, with the aim being a character-representable set of
binary data that can be copy/pasted safely and passed through diverse
So the question is what's more important; ability to transport strings
of data without a significant length penalty, ability to transport
strings of arbitrary data without affecting the transport, or ability to
copy/paste (a subset of "transport" I guess).
Given these, my personal feeling is that if your concern is
transport-related, which implies that you can't control the transport,
then stick with base64. If your concern is length, then I don't feel
UTF8 will offer a significant advantage, and you're much better off
using something like length-prefixing like bencoding does it. If your
concern is copy-pasteability, then base58 works and probably is no worse
than base-utf8, while being significantly easier to implement in code.
Spurious rant over.
* Take for example the way early email was sent, where headers were
specified and then the server awaited the body of the message, the end
of which was indicated by what amounts to a string of characters; a
newline, a period, and another newline. Easily injected by accident or
design, along with other commands.

Two thoughts on this. Firstly, that this mailing list certainly does
have well resourced enemies known to employ tactics like "persona
management" and COINTELPRO, etc. etc.; I would actually find it
implausible to assume they don't stir shit up to ruin the signal/noise
ratio on the most overtly political applied-cryptography mailing list
out there.
Secondly, it's true that cheap ano/pseudo/nymity seems to permit people
to express personality traits they would moderate if they had a
reputation to maintain. This has often made me wonder about just why
Anonymous seems *vaguely* stable despite the whole, (er, membership?)
being anons.
But of course, they're not Anons, they're Pseudons. Most of the active
and influential membership go by names they've built reputational
capital upon. They can't afford to throw that capital away by being
dicks all the time. If they want to be dicks, they have to sock-puppet,
and Anon discussion format is usually chat-based on moderated servers
like IRC, so flames can get put out if the mod feels like it.. or
high-signal people can migrate to a private room trivially.
All of this makes pointless trolling like we're seeing on this list
pretty expensive compared to a mailing list with little moderation. You
can't afford to burn a 'nym because making a new 'nym is expensive
(socially, if not computationally; nobody listens to a newfag), and
there's simply no way to prevent high-signals from discussing things
without you because Chat just works better that way.
All very navel-gaze-y way of saying that Mailing lists are far more
prone to the tragedy of the commons, and that if bloody Anonymous can do
a better job of keeping the Signal ratio high then perhaps things need
further thought.

The obvious problem is that not everyone will pay, so you'll end up in a
filter bubble of people who think their speech is so important it's
worth tacking money on to make you read it, and people who think *you
listening to them* is so important it requires money.
One option to fix this is to revive mail priority levels, and set things
up so that you can only have your mail regarded by recipients as "high
priority" if it comes with cash.
Another option is to have a pseudocurrency within mail; not a real
thing, though perhaps exchangeable in bulk for real money, but just a
way to measure roughly speaking the sending-to-receiving ratio of the
That is, when I set up my account, a well-respected server mints me 10
tokens for sending email. Recipients will weigh my mail in higher favour
if I include a token, so by default I spend one per email. Recipients
get to keep my tokens, in a bitcoinish transactional fashion. If I run
out of tokens, people are more likely to ditch or ignore my mail, and I
may have to mint some more by doing something free but time consuming
like hard-proof-of-work (think hashcash in advance) or paying real money.
So, if I'm running a normal email account, I'll send and receive my mail
in a certain ratio, and that'll lead to a certain rate of coin
accumulation or loss, but it'll be manageable. I might have to do
hashcash now and again to replenish if I send more than I receive, or I
might be swimming in 'coin if I receive lots and send little.
But if I'm a spammer, I'll run out immediately, and have to buy more or
spend a lot of time minting; same principal as hashcash, prohibitively
expensive for something that requires huge volumes to catch the
occasional idiot.
This is a bastard combination of hashcash (which would have and would
still work well if implemented, I feel) and the current
white/blacklisting system for servers that impose a moderation
responsibility on SMTP servers. But I think it mixes them in good ratio.
Servers who are trusted can arbitrarily mint, but the usage of coins
makes abuse self-limiting, so there's less load on the servers to
moderate and invade privacy.

Biggest FAIL in json is lack of binary. I think a quick extension to bencoding is in order: "u" prefix for utf8, "b" for binary. Other types are pretty generally useful as-is. Replace "d", "l" and "e" with curly and square braces for readability. Bencoding's structure and basic idea is nice as it's terse and understandable, but also easy to make security guarantees about: length prefix, and on parse errors just dump the input and error out. Minimal overhead for raw binary, which is what you want for crypto, file transfers, and VoiP streams. Trivial to write in any language so rapidly portable, and can be coded recursively with relative ease without sacrificing understandability or security (much).
Thoughts? Bencoding 2.0?

You can also shove NUL bytes into any other transfer encoding to make
headaches for the recipient, it's not an encoding-specific problem. It's
up to the author of a decoder to account for their language's issues. In
C, you'd have to treat the data as binary, not a string, to avoid NUL
termination, and only decode (safely) that which is explicitly described
as a UTF8 string by leading with "u"; if that contains premature NULs,
it's an error condition.

References: Interesting; I'm scanning the code now, but won't pretend to be an expert.
First thing, your HMAC code is possibly vulnerable to a timing attack:
..using direct string/byte comparisons for HMACs can be vulnerable as
most languages will shortcut on the first mismatch. In your case, using
this attack might require the means to craft a message that matches a
certain hash, but maybe someone who knows more could use this to recover
key material? The way to avoid this is a comparison function whose time
does not depend on the likeness or unlikeness of the compared values,
for example by xoring the strings or characters.
Second issue is the use of LibPurple at all. It's widely considered to
be a security trainwreck, and given its poor reputation *and* the total
disinclination of the libpurple devs to bother with security concerns at
all, it's easy to imagine anything up to remote code execution in
libpurple compromising the whole system.
So, your tinfoil hat could be as secure as anything, but relying on
libpurple may undermine the entire exercise. Using a different transport
may be more valuable.
Finally, you're using a custom HWRNG, and reading with custom C code to
a file. Firstly, why is this a C function, when you could probably
achieve it in Python? But, more importantly, why not use the system call
to deliver this entropy to /dev/urandom, and use that? The mixing code
for /dev/urandom has received pretty good review, far more than your
code can hope for, so the more you rely on /dev/urandom IMO the better.
There's a Linux system call to mix entropy into the system pool, and
your HWRNG would be well served to use that if you ask me.
And, you could probably access that call using ctypes from Python
without requiring your end users to compile C. The less compilation
required, the more likely you are to get user buy-in.

It would be my opinion, off the top of my head, that this approach would
not be useful in a "mass surveillance" context. Many of the volotiles
under study would be abundant in ambient air pollution or even in clear
country air; that they have diagnostic significance is tied to the
context of a direct breath test, for example.
So, I can imagine a mass-surveillance apparatus attempting to detect
ketones as part of a system that detects diabetics or drunkards, but
where a simple breeze is enough to mask a potential match, and a rotting
piece of fruit discarded on the subway floor is enough to swamp the
sensors for hours.
Smell is all about context, and it's the sort of context I am doubtful
could be made useful in a computerised fashion for mass surveillance.
Quite unlike, for example, sound, vision or even smell, which are far
more easily localisable and distinguishable.

thought of services that make use of cloud-stored keys in the past. But
the critical ingredient to getting this right is CPU/RAM-hard key

"userland" code that rejects stupid passwords entirely.
Of course, hackers will be able to circumvent
shitty-password-restrictions, but we hope that the band of people

The problem with Keybase is that the infrastructure they're based upon,
PGP/GPG, is probably not using modern key generation algorithms by
default for symmetric encryption of keys. So, how many keys are
encrypted using key algos that are easily cracked? If they were using
hard keygen algos, then even bad-but-not-terrible passwords would be
not-entirely-trivial to crack. But keybase can't even enforce that,
because the PGP infrastructure is too legacy-laden.

Hey Pontifex,
Exactly, it doesn't. OpenPGP/GnuPG allows (strongly encourages!) you to
encrypt your private key, so that you can only perform private key
operations if you provide your passphrase.
*In theory*, a well-encrypted private key can be uploaded to the NSA's
own servers without hazard; this is the idea of "semantic security", I'm
told. So, uploading a well-encrypted private keypair to keybase *should*
be OK, with certain caveats.
Leaving aside that it's a bad idea anyway, because the fewer copies of
your private key there are under various passphrases the better, my main
concern is that OpenPGP never was designed for semantic security with
modern key-cracking in mind. So, decrypting private keys for use is
quite fast, whereas you really want decryption to take a second or more
so that brute-force cracking will take forever.
Really though, I'm wondering whether it makes no difference how good the
key schedule is because many people will continue to use terrible
passphrases for their keys, and keybase or their NSA friends could just
parallel-brute-force every key in the DB and compromise those keys
quickly, using them to spread falsified keys with good standing in the WoT.
You're making assumptions about my level of knowledge on the subject,
here. I'm discussing the suitability of the key schedules used for
encrypted PGP private keys by available software, and whether these
schedules are suitable for use entrusting your key to a remote, US-based
webservice in a "zero knowledge" way. Especially as probably most
OpenPGP implementations won't sanitise stupid passphrases.

@_subject: Obscurity via Cross-Coin Exchanges 
Hey all,
As it came up in the Mt Gox asides in one of the variously titled
threads on Nakomoto etc.: Bitcoin's pretty pseudonymous, rather than
anonymous. Coin transactions are public, and some can be pinned to real
identities, vendors or products, while others can be well inferred,
leaving a smaller, hard to quantify set of "really anonymous" addresses,
coins and transactions. Added to that, you have coin "taint" and badly
patched wallets that mix coins from other addresses when sending
payments, correlating various receiving addresses in one single transaction.
There are laundries, but my understanding is that they're not highly
regarded; their methods may be questionable, potentially they can be
untangled. Without a large enough set of users, you have little
guarantee of laundering; if only Alice and Bob pay in, and Alice and Bob
receive out, then the recipient set is clearly too bad to protect them!
OK, big problem. Zerocoin was designed to help fix that problem, by
minting a zero-knowledge-proof based 'coin, but it hasn't yet been
What about simply exchanging different blockchain based coins, though?
Would that not help to "launder" with reasonable efficacy, provided both
participants use crypto to hide the transaction? From the outside,
transactions occur on both blockchains, but there's no "data trail"
correlating the transactions with one another as there is within each
So, Alice buys .4 btc from a friend, but knows the friend's opsec might
be poor, or that the transaction may have occurred over a bad channel,
or that the coins were purchased from an exchange that demands valid
phone numbers, etc.: she wants to launder.
She contacts Bob, a Dogecoin seller, to set up a private exchange. She
asks him to sell her 0.4btc worth of Dogecoin in two transactions of
unequal value (to prevent analysis by exchange rate to ID their
transaction). They conduct the exchange over an encrypted channel.

So pissed off with all the crap on this plane. Everyone wants to spin
some story about how it implicates their favourite enemy. The
"Intelligence Community" are suggesting it's hackers, so they can use it
as a pearl harbour to attack the hacker community, and the media are
sucking it up.
I've seen two separate accounts from Pilots who present the view that,
based on prior examples and their own training and experience,
everything about the flight's flightpath, instrumentation failure,
radio-darkness and disappearance is consistent with an onboard fire.
Once suggested underinflated landing gear on long takeoff under
hot/humid conditions could create blowout/smoulder conditions for
frontal landing gear, which would smoke out the plane.
In prior cases where this happens, a fire in landing gear can destroy a
plane in ~5m, destroying control instrumentation. But first, procedures
for firefighting demand nonessential instruments *including radio* are
disabled while the fault and fire location are determined.
Again in prior cases, the plane will (with an experienced pilot)
immediately divert path to the nearest, not the "best", airport, which
is what this did. And again as in prior cases, it may eventually fail to
arrive as the crew succumb to smoke (oxygen masks not an option in case
of fires) and the plane will fly "dark" on autopilot until ditching in
the ocean.
That all the Pilots are saying "Probably Fire" and nobody's listening,
in favour of all sorts of bizarre and unlikely conspiracies, says a lot
about our maturity and our level of openness to fearmongering.

One account I read held that telemetry is initially disabled, then
re-enabled sequentially while the cause is narrowed down. But that the
priorities are so urgent (you have about 3 minutes to live) that
actually using the communications equipment is not an option; the pilot
must immediately land while trying to narrow the problem, full-stop.
The scenario plays out in other cases that didn't go well that the crew
ultimately succumb to smoke/monoxide inhalation and simply pass out,
leaving the plane continuing on autopilot, *and pinging quietly*, until
it ditches.
That was the scenario I read, at least. All the other scenarios seem
equally unlikely in the first place, but also unlikely to be so clean
and tidy. Hackers hack the instruments? Great! How many flight-school
trained hackers can successfully pilot a plane from the in-flight
entertainment system? In fact, how many hackers of that calibre,
full-stop, have any experience flying planes? That's your suspect group.
Where are they, then?
Government or state-sponsored hijackers? Then why such a confusing job?
Why so silent yet also suspicious? And why instantly turn to the nearest
airport, whereas hijackers would take a more circuitous route?
Want to just crash a plane because you're a fairy-tale terrorist? Then
why the silence, and no terror-inspiring speeches claiming credit, and
why disable radio communications on the plane? You want terror, right
mister stereotyped extremely-unlikely-person?
To me this has all the hallmarks of an unfortunate accident, and after
reading the pilots' fire explanations, both of which referenced
real-world examples, I'm pretty happy to agree with the experts in
aviation over the Intel wonks looking for Cyber Pearl Harbour or the
media fools looking for an amazing scoop.

I'm in devil's advocate territory here, because I neither trust nor
distrust Tor/i2p, feeling that we can't really be sure one way or
another. But:
Time for me to fulfil Godwin's Law and discuss Nazis! When the UK broke
Enigma, they were able to decrypt Nazi comms with their spies on UK
mainland, and by the end of the war they had turned or neatly disposed
of the lot of them. This was so effective that by the time the V2
rockets started raining down, the UK were able to feed false info back
along the wires instructing the Nazis to aim wildly off target, and
telling them that the casualties were drastic, and the (extremely
expensive) program a wild success.
In the modern day, you have a scenario where every significant opponent
of the fascists use forms of cryptography that *may* be vulnerable to
the fascists' level of technical sophistication; we don't know, really.
But if they *can* crack Tor/i2p in limited circumstances, they sure as
hell wouldn't let anybody know; including the monkies in the "lower"
agencies who might do something as dumb as prosecuting someone on
Tor-derived evidence. They would instead use the information as the UK
did on their predecessors: to identify, neutralise or (better yet) turn
them when necessary, but until that point simply to gather more
information and find more targets.
The patience of spies can look like inability or apathy, until they have

There's now precedent to suggest that providing FISA-ordered data in a
deliberately inconvenient format can be considered contempt of court.
The case establishing it? Lavabit printing out their server TLS keys in
small font. That's not even such a big deal, because OCR could still be
used trivially if the opponents weren't tech-illiterate. Depending on
the type of key, you could probably even detect OCR errors quickly by
checking for primality or group-compatibility for the key subunits.
So that's even less technically troublesome than what you're suggesting,
and it was contempt. I don't think the telecoms would get away with it,

I actually think, having used it for some time and liking it on the
whole, that Retroshare isn't suited to this.
The primary reason is RS only receives mail if the sender and recipient
are online at the same time. There's no store-and-forward, even though
all messages are PGP encrypted to recipients.
RS also has a lot of feature-bloat; it's better thought of as P2P
Facebook than a simple communication system.
Finally, RS is engineered to a simple and admirable purpose which makes
it unsuited to email replacement; it's Friend to Friend. That's great in
its use-case, but I think email should be:
1) Rapid and censorship-resilient routing
2) Single canonical addresses for each participant, which are
3) Churn-tolerant
4) Expensive to send, to deter spam otherwise facilitated by to (1)
5) Practical for payloads between 10M and 20M, no greater.
I do *not* think the core of a replacement email should guarantee
anonymity, but the protocol should make allowances for that if possible.
I think the above could be satisfied using a pseudo-blockchain for
name->key mappings, and a key-routed DHT for creating routes for mail
delivery. Credit is earned by routing other people's mail in
store-and-forward fashion, like email. Credit can be spent to
register new mail address:key mappings and to pay for routing of larger
messages, or to prolong retention of messages before they bounce (if
your intended recipient does not run a high-uptime mailserver and may
need a day or two to log in).
That resembles Twister, the coupling of DHT:Blockchain, but may be
better suited to the model than twister is (because twister hit problems
with scaling DHT use to many followers, I think), because email is
slower and stabler than microstatus systems; more amenable to
P2P-isation, whereas rapid updates coupled with mass-queries to other
feeds is a setup better suited to a client:server interaction. The
blockchain would need tweaking, because Twister is using scrypt, which
is now apparently ASIC-able, e.g. useless. I think a password encrypting
function whose parameters are set dynamically by the value of the prior
block might help fix matters; the goal is for the ideal "ASIC" for the
function to be a consumer CPU, not a GPU or dedicated ASIC.
Anyway, sorry for the wall of text. Killing/replacing email is often on
my mind.

I have long thought that it's high time to implement JS code signing
that can be verified by the client, either innately or through an extension.
A quick addition to the comment-metadata system devised to provide
licensing information (and parsed by an FSF extension to inform you
whether the code your browser is running is libre or not) could be used
for this purpose; what's left, then, is to establish a way to translate
code signatures into trust.
For a monolithic system like a zero-knowledge email host, that's easy;
when you sign up, you install their pubkey into your extension,
preventing MITM attacks on the JS payload. At best, that's an additional
layer over SSL, or it could be used instead of SSL (a crypto-AJAX engine
run in browser for sending and receiving data; could be handy for shared
hosting where SSL isn't an option).
However, it falls down vs. NSLs, etcetera, because hosts can be
compelled to send you malware signed with their keys. You need
trustworthy third parties who can sign and verify that code is shipped
intact. It'd be nice if you could hack a system like this to use the PGP
web of trust as a first port of call, and then to fall back to a wider
set of "trusted" people if that fails.
As a way to further enhance security, having people with these
extensions installed send hashes of the JS payloads they receive to a
comparison server would be nice. Might even detect some attacks that fly
under the radar at present, like people being sent tailored-attack
versions of major third-party libs like JQuery, etcetera. When an
anomalous hash arrives that doesn't match any "official" releases of the
lib, alarm bells should ring.

The question is not whether or not you can securely disclose that you
are under NSL. The question is whether you can do so without, when the
word breaks, being in trouble for leaking that information.
So yes, you can establish all sorts of wonderful contraptions that "get
the word out", publicly or privately, on or off-shore, so that the
people outside can disseminate warnings that you've been compromised.
But in the end, the stasi will blame you, and no matter how much
cooked-up legal convolution you wrap yourself in, they will nail you to
a cross.
My view is that engaging in such convolutions serves two
counterproductive ends:
1) It makes it seem as if you acknowledge that you should not be
disclosing the NSL; a Jury, if you were so lucky and were actually
allowed to testify before them in your defence (lol Grand Jury) would be
suspicious of your motives. Why all the cloak-and-dagger? It's easy for
the prosecution to make you seem shady and suspicious for acting in that
2) It delays your disclosure and allows the stasi time and opportunity
to preempt and prevent your disclosure entirely.
Also,  you're an optimist, clearly. The US may be exhausting
political capital fast, but it has plenty of political capital, and
plenty of economic capital to back that up when it fails. In the end,
they'll get you unless you're big enough to occupy international
attention and get a state-level ally to protect you. The only two people
to even partially escape persecution so far are holed up under the
protection of state-level adversaries of the US, and even they are still
at significant risk.

Oh, for sure Moxie has a threat model that makes sense to him, but I dispute that it makes any sense in the real world. Google's certificate system is TOFU, so whatever certificate Google pushes to a users' device is what that device trusts updates from thenceforth. And, there's no obvious way for an Android user to verify a certificate *even if they were so inclined*. For my part, as an Android user with a knowledge of and interest in crypto, I have *never* checked a signed APK. Ever.
So, if even the more technical end of Moxie's customer base don't check APK signatures, and if most people simply take what Google Play offers them, what's to stop Google pushing a malicious TextSecure? Nothing. Nothing, at all, ever. And all the machinations and air-gaps Moxie and co implement are meaningless, because the TOFU scheme makes Google the root of all trust on the Google Play market.
If it were merely about certificates, Moxie would offer up-to-date APKs through his own website and F-Droid repository, allowing him to have utter control over timely updates without an intermediate trusted agent. But he doesn't, and when I asked I finally got an answer: It's because F-Droid doesn't offer metrics, debugging, and analytics. Essentially, he wants Google play so he can get silent feedback on what the Apps are doing in the wild.
I don't object to this as long as it's opt-in for users, but I do object that it's being presented as something (threat model) rather than developer convenience. I love TextSecure, and I'm grateful to Moxie and co for creating it. It lets me layer security on a legacy platform that everyone uses in a way that's transparent and extremely user-friendly, while offering security granularity for those so inclined (cert checks). But the delivery is through an intermediary that are essentially a public-facing wing of the NSA, and they have total control over the trust/threat model for 95% of the user-base. So..I don't even.

The word you're looking for is "fascist". The Nazis were one particular expression and culture of fascist, by no means the only one and certainly not the last.
I happen to disagree with the supposed primacy of Godwin's Law because the Nazis are a cultural touchstone on the horrors of fascism in practice, a thing we should all remain vigilant upon. A friend pointed out to me that more people have died of fascism than gun crime, and that (until recently) civil gun ownership was a good preventative measure against fascism.
I was never against small arms ownership per se, but it put the argument for civil ownership of rifles in perspective for me. With Drones everywhere these days, I don't think rifles matter anymore, though; so it's moot as far as I'm concerned.
Not being a violent person by nature, I'd like to think that our future solutions against fascism are social and network-based, but there's room to discuss whether civil access to drones and other automated weapons will play a role against fascist uprisings; if the Rifle was the standard of anti-fascism in the past, is the drone the standard now? Or is it the ubiquitous camera? I'd rather think the latter, but cameras don't seem to stop militarised "police" from assaulting civilians, they just cover their badges and storm-trooper onwards*.
In the ideal case, we find a way to undermine this violence. But, when the fascists come to round up their subject of persecution du jour, I do believe those people should be entitled to self defence.
Just some evening thoughts, sorry.
*It was only when observing the behaviour of US/UK police towards civilians, particularly the former, that I realised how lucky we are in Ireland to have an unarmed police force whose title "Garda Siochána" literally means "Guardians of the Peace".

To clarify on your "complexity" argument, are you saying that the POTUS-parade may be employing technology that detects other devices by their output signatures, then fires a noise-beam specifically at them to maximise power delivery and minimise energy costs/unnecessary interference?
If that were the case, then a shielded, passive receiver ought to be OK, would that not include a HAM radio in listen-only mode? (<- Knows little about HAM) ->So, did OP broadcast much prior to the interference, or was their rig poorly shielded?
For my part, I just doubt they're using intelligent jamming because cost isn't really a factor in their requirements, is it? They can just blare out on all the frequencies they care about, and strong-arm providers at other spectra to blackzone the region. How much power is needed to jam at the frequency band you described? We're talking about a cavalcade that could, if they considered it necessary, employ a portable nuke! Power ain't a limiting factor! :)

It's important not to forget i2p when discussing darknets, and I see
many more positive uses of i2p than Tor hidden services; straightforward
social networks, search engines, etcetera. The developers curate a
simple list of "positive" eepsites for the preinstalled router, so it's
got a good community spirit. I've used it for email, microstatus and a
few other things besides, and there's a lot more diversity of hidden
services by other users because of the ease of setting hidden services
up (indeed, every user has one preconfigured by default).

By contrast, .onion *today*, along with .i2p and .bit, are all
configuration-heavy, meaning virtually nobody will actually access or
use them unless they're already completely dedicated customers. The Silk

to buy drugs "safely" online (along with plenty of other reprehensible

I'm thinking of benign web services that enrich the world in some way,
but suffer censorship or legal assault because they disturb the

whistleblowing site, or the next transborder social network. Those

mainstream in the near future, that'd be very powerful.
Of course, .onion will remain slow as sin, but for those websites they
can use .onion with 304 redirects to non-onion TLDs for each visitor; as
their clearnet TLDs get shut down they can just register new ones and
304 redirect to them on the fly for each new visitor; whack-a-mole on a

No flame war called for or implied, I'm just genuinely curious to get
Yes, granted. Although, I think where security is concerned it would be
nice for developers of the software to have their own "LTS" releases
that only get security bug-fixes and not new releases.
And, as below, that's because otherwise maintainers of stable OS
branches have to make their own LTS codebases which deviate from the
actual developers'!
Well, yes; there were occasions where bad maintainers removed the
entropy-gathering code from major crypto libraries, thinking them to be
use-after-frees! So, in general it's true that the developers should
also be the packagers.
But, what to do, then? If the devs must also facilitate packaging, that
means they must have a nod to multi-arch build/install pipelines, and
that they must support an LTS that doesn't include new "features" but
only focuses on bug-fixes and security.
How many projects do this already? Reading Smári's recent post about
working with GnuPG, and the rapidly changing, highly unstable API he has
to work with, and seeing that OpenSSL (lacking the resources, I'll grant
you!) don't seem to support a "mini-OpenSSL" with only the safe,
well-audited code, it seems that most of the fundamental code we rely on
isn't ready for LTS packaging by the developers.
So, instead the package maintainers who've volunteered for the job try
to do a patchy job of making LTS releases, and we end up with epic fail.
So what do you suggest? Arch seems to use the latest code from devs,
with all the new "features" alongside bugfixes, whereas Debian leans
toward patchy ad-hoc-LTS because official LTS is rarely available.
Neither approach is ideal for security or reliability, but the latter
approach invariably appeals more to the companies that are tasked with
handling our data!

Now, you could get the phone to take action on its own that might assist

You'll be disappointed to hear that recycling is largely irrelevant on the global scale, and was favoured by green parties as a policy only because it gets voters involved and makes them feel important to the solution. Same goes for changing to efficient lightbulbs; it's helpful, but practically negligible compared to your daily commute, your choice of diet, your insulation, etcetera.
In the end, industry, and the consumer products we buy from it that fuel its bad behaviour, is far worse for the environment than piffling things like bulbs and recycling. Buying less waste is better than segregating it.
What we need is energy decline, and what that means is travelling less, buying less, burning less. Our energy should come from nuclear, not coal. Our buildings shouldn't be made from concrete. Our diets should use less land; less meat, and higher yields (go-go-gmo!). Our products should last longer and do more (cf. Bunnie's concept of "heirloom laptops"), instead of doing less faster and then breaking and getting "recycled" by impoverished kids in bangladesh.
It's a totally systemic problem, and bullying people into just recycling makes them think that they've done their part, and the rest is up to the next worst person. They need to understand that shutting down the coal plant in their city would do more good all-round than if everyone in the city recycled everything they bought.

Yea..even the places it's been before are pretty awful, for a human. I don't think this is a local unstable point, far from it; our current climate seems very stable. But, over those epochs, we've built up a huge store of high-energy carbon, and as the CO2 left the atmosphere since those epochs, the ecosystems we have right now are not accustomed to high-greenhouse climates. So, the fact that we're now suddenly digging up what amounts to eons of free solar energy, and are burning them all at once, is a problem.
Will the earth burn? No, that's an unlikely outcome. Venus is Venus because it never developed life. Will the Earth burn *us*? Maybe. Totally plausible possibility, though still unlikely. Will the Earth burn the ecosystems that civilisation (rather than humanity, per se) depends on? At this rate, probably.
We have fallbacks; go all-in on solar & nuclear for energy and biotech for efficient, lower impact food/med production, and use nuclear/biotech to cook up some hyperefficient carbon-capture system to try and roll back as much as we can.
I'll just point at this, then, as an example of what I find exciting in this space:  - That's some staple elemental inputs, CO2, and electricity ONLY, and a massive sequestration effect per volt/meter using bacteria. Outputs are hydrogen and acetate, useful energy/industrial chemicals.
Anyways, just to say doom and gloom is rarely useful, but ostrich-heads are worse than useless. Action can be beneficial, and action need not be "live like a peasant", it can be "change your tech and culture to live comfortably or even abundantly with less impact".
As to on/off topic-ness, it's off topic. But this list has seen people bitching about who is and isn't a real native American, so I find this at least engaging and interesting.

So, a 'movement' that claims to want "journalistic integrity", which absent press censorship means "self regulation", can't be bothered policing its own ranks to stop misogynistic slander and death-threats. How many "Gamergaters" spend time chasing others for doxxing, threatening and slandering women in technology? As many as actually take part in these acts? I doubt it, and I see no evidence of such self-policing at a meaningful scale.
I'm sure there are honest, decent people using the "Gamergate" flag to call for something-something, but the fact that they're using that flag after it's been so thoroughly dragged through the muck *by other gamergaters* shows that they are content to accept misogyny in exchange for trending status on Twitter, rather than forking what's become more of a *bowel* movement into something with a measure of the integrity they claim to demand of others.

Don't get me wrong, basebands are probably swiss cheese and they are
often (or usually?) masters to the mobile OS. On my model of phone IIRC
they even directly share some RAM, so they can read/write willy-nilly
the Android RAM. So the idea of baseband attacks overwhelming the OS is
perfectly sound and something to bear in mind.
All that said, this is a glorified marketing campaign for the company in

256?), PyCrypto, and WireShark.
I never did decrypt any stuff to get their encryption protocol worked
out, so I don't have a protocol to share. I abandoned this long before
succeeding in decryption because of one critical detail I discovered,
which undermined *any* interest I had in an intercompatible app. It
became clear at this instant that the people at Bittorrent, fond as they
are of secret-sauce closed-source "encryption", hadn't a clue.
So, they were using AES256, as it turned out! Using the base32 encoded
form of a private key. So, while they were advertising 256 bits, in
actuality they had much less entropy in the key they were using than
that. I gave up; what else can be hiding in there if they didn't grasp
the basic concept of key entropy?
So now they're into P2P VoiP, and my response is DO NOT WANT. Bittorrent
Inc. have no cultural knowledge of the value of openness in software
design, especially in security or encryption, and based on my own
personal experience this leads to stupid design decisions that will
directly endanger the privacy and security of their users.

References: But you can memorise a passphrase and email address, and generate your
public key on the fly using key generation algorithms like the one used
in miniLock/deadLock. This deterministic key approach has its
disadvantages, but it addresses two key issues with PGP:
1) Your key doesn't exist when you're not "logged in" to a program
implementing the standard, so it can't be scooped and
brute-force-decrypted by an evil maid or the later installation of a
2) When out with friends, if you discover a friend who likes crypto or
convince someone else to try it, you can generate your pubkey on the fly
by "logging in", either on your own computer or theirs. Yes, this
transiently generates your private key on potentially untrusted
hardware, so it's a risk that must be carefully measured.
I think the "mail encryption for all" problem is entirely crackable. I
feel this would be trivial if we'd accept encryption tied to particular
devices, because that would hand off entirely the key management issue.
But, we don't want to be tied to particular devices, so we end up with
stupid problems like OTR keys that are different between phone and
laptop, or PGP keys not trusted on a phone, so can't decrypt. Key
generation on the fly helps to some extent, but it's hard to patch into
an existing system.
It would be nice if some future "email" was an entirely on-the-fly
affair; "logging in" deterministically generates a keypair *and* the
address in a DHT to visit to collect your most recent mail. Same process
on any device, uses proven primitives. With some UX to forbid weak keys
(like the key strength checker in miniLock) and a well designed, costly
key derivation function, you're pretty secure, and your mail can be
stored in plaintext or kept encrypted locally at the option of the
implementor or user.

Given this, I'd choose the option that doesn't require NSA binaries on my device and potentially passes data through a "dumb pipe" outside NSA's jurisdiction and budget. It costs them a lot more to tap Irish SMS networks than to simply receive, through Google, your messages directly, so at least I'm costing them more. ;)

References: The SOC in a raspi is probably no worse than the rest, but consider that the natural entropy available (for Crypto) to a SOC is much lower than a multi-component system like a laptop or tower. The Raspi 1.xx has an onboard entropy chip you can enable, if you trust it, and there'll be a new device in /dev you can read raw entropy from. Write that to /dev/random to seed the system pool and use /dev/urandom as your actual source.
Personally I'd draw from several sources to feed /dev/random: an internal hash-chain (quick Python script) (re)seeded on a password and urandom periodically, the hardware entropy generator, Ubuntu's seed server.. don't trust one source, mash them up once a minute/hour and feed them to /dev/random.

Forcing those in power *not* to look back at us, and granting ourselves greater ability to visualise power's actions, are not mutually exclusive goals. We should be doing both, including methods to hide ourselves and to better monitor and hold accountable those in power.
Of course, those monitoring are often punished, so necessarily the ability to monitor *and* hide go hand in hand.
In other words I reckon the approach of fighting mass surveillance (including acknowledging that corporations are NOT people and their surveillance is qualitatively different from my private CCTV system) and pushing for greater transparency, in tandem with mass-crypto and ubiquitous sousveillance, is exactly the right thing to do..and it's more or less what I think we're doing already globally with the cypherpunk, pirate party, and eff-ist movements.

This all makes it sound like the Irish bit is above racism, a privileged "white person" class that's never had any negative discrimination.
Back in the golden days of the British Empire there were academic discussions on how the Irish constituted a different sub-species of lesser humanity. Racism hasn't always been about skin colour, and still Irish might have it somewhat easier today (but prejudices remain), but racism of all kinds, including anti-"white" (what the fuck is "White"? What the fuck is "Black"?), is just more of the same stupidity.
Newsflash; the genetic diversity within any given "racial" population you choose is *far* greater than the miniscule genetic differences that define the characteristics we call "race". There is no such thing as "race" except that which we create in our monkey heads.

This is the classic "Barium Meal Test", a highly effective way to find a I have been meaning for some time to write a quick pythons script which implements the Barium Meal Test on plain text, perhaps even in a distributed way; by making common misspellings, by replacing whitespace with unicode equivalents (bit too obvious?), by making synonymous punctuation modifications - a dash rather than a semicolon as in this sentence couplet, for example.
Part of the idea is to help identify "moles" in follower networks of "private users" in P2P social networks, when people "retweet" private messages. If you could divide your followers into groups and give each group a different barium meal'd message, then after a few "leaks" you'd be able to identify likely leakers.
The other part was to point out how easy such identifying substitutions are to make, and to make people acutely aware of the risks involved in sharing potentially watermarked information.

Earlier, in fact. The phrase "tragedy of the commons" derives from nobel-prize-winning research that found that unregulated commons more often than not are abused to the point of collapse. It's hard to see how this can happen to a source-code commons, but only as far as you see the "commons" in source code being the code itself, rather than the free labour it represents on the part of well-meaning programmers.
By propping up proprietary shitware with your lovingly crafted code, you are undermining not only yourself, but the others out there lovingly crafting and then freeing their code. Of course, the shitware doesn't develop as quickly as the "real" curated stuff, so we see Linux thriving in so many ways technically versus Windows and Mac..but then, the lack of protections against theft of the commons is the reason Mac is doing so well in the first place.

It's worth pointing out for clarity that I wasn't rabbiting the point used by the powerful to enclose commons, where regulation means enclosure, but rather referring to enclosure itself as the tragedy.
I will happily read the directed Manifesto, thanks. But I think it's also clear that commons are often abused, though the classical abuse appears uncommon.. because unregulated commons simply collapse early. Those that appear "unregulated" are more often regulated by social structures; no less significant than threats of reprisal in the right However, online, we lack the means to enforce social censure effectively, particularly against large enclosing actors.

Well, no; he wants them to use it as much as they like, as long as they give back to the commons on which they built their foundations. There's nothing at all wrong with asking that.
RMS would likely be insulted at the idea that he would forbid essential freedoms to *anyone*, including the companies he hates.
There's an undercurrent in some patches of this discussion, if I may, that suggests that openness is orthogonal to commercial success; the idea being that GPL is "anti-business" and weaker licenses are "pro-business". I'll just throw in "citation needed" with the reminder that correlation does not imply causation.
Users (more like "Used") buy Windows all the time even though everyone knows it can be had for free. Music lovers continue to pay for music even though it's common knowledge that it can be had with less malware on torrent sites, or simply cribbed from friends. Same for books, same for everything.
Artificial scarcity creates artificial demand, but a natural abundance does not diminish natural demand. And if you want to sell open code, it had better be GPL, or your competitors will steal all your best ideas and leave you with an inferior product. With GPL, you *invite* your competitors to improve with you, while you both crib one another's work and get better and more usefully distinct over time.

Which mildly concerns me also, however it's in Beta so I suspect when 1.0 lands it'll be "additional disk space" plus additional features.
Besides, the threat model is pretty transparent (content is invisible but senders/recipients/times all visible to server owner) and the client is open source and runs on a vetted crypto-scheme. The server is not open (yet?) but the documentation on the github makes the entire protocol very clear, so re-implementing would be time consuming but Implementing a third-party server that federates, and extending the code to allow for cross-domain messages could make this a nice websocket-based standard replacement for email that's crypto-first, at last.

Well, anyone with a brain knows they do, and that statements from a US company are meaningless because nobody wants to go to jail over an NSL.
What a top-level observer can see (AFAIK) is who's logged in, probably what their username/keyID is, and how much they're talking to the server.
Because peerio uses miniLock formatted messages, the potential exists for minimal-knowledge service, but from the github docs it seems the server maintains an entry for which user is allowed to access which encrypted files, and therefore reveals to an observer who's the recipient.
So, it's a metadata-rich service, little better in that regard than email.. although the encryption is pretty well designed and unless you set up a "PIN" there's no permanent storage of private keys even on your computer, so it's also quite secure when crossing borders.
Also, there is a feature that clearly relies on compliant clients, where you can delete files from the server including copies sent to clients. Obviously if the attached files are downloaded from the system, this can't reach them, but it will destroy any "authenticated" copies of the messages from the server, if it works (you're trusting the server). OPSEC wise, this is a nice feature because it means you can clean up after yourself and keep the authenticated-data-at-rest on either end of a conversation to a minimum.

Well, I use my real name in most places and communicate a lot with real-world friends and family by email, su using Peerio is therefore a step up in security for me even if I continue to go by my usual name and use my usual IPs.
If you need hard anonymity, this is only a marginal gain over regular email because metadata (when, who, how, where) is a significant threat to anonymity. So yea, use a burner email when setting up a peerio account (no longer required after setup, probably a throwback to email-as-salt in miniLock plus contact discovery by known email address), then use through Tor (do research whether websockets are  > Cool.

Spideroak appears to be more about file storage and sync, whereas Peerio seems to me to simply be a better approach to server:client email. It's down to the bone: message-passing with attachments, and a nice UI.
As a crypto-app, it's targeted at the mainstream, and people who interact with the mainstream. People on this list will have better, more secure ways of communicating, but Nadim (to his credit) excels at making crypto-apps that can appeal to normal users while adding a significant privacy. It's an easier sell from "us" to "them".

If the server code were open, how would you know the server was actually running that code anyway? Having the protocol documented so thoroughly makes the task of writing an alternative server trivial if time-consuming. I'd obviously prefer the server were AGPL, and I hope someone will write an AGPL'd server and federation.
For now though, the client is open source, the crypto doesn't suck, the UX is excellent, and the threat model is pretty transparent. I'm *never* going to inflict PGP on friends, but I'll happily inflict this on them.

Keybase could have been a great way to encourage PGP uptake among normal people years ago when things were accepted to be difficult universally, but PGP's days are behind us. PGP makes a good way to sign code but remains a terrible way to communicate securely, because although it's "uncrackable" when used correctly, it's very easy to accidentally screw up using PGP on either end of the conversation. Also, the lack of PFS ignores parts of the modern threat model that were speculative when PGP was created.
Suffice to say that, even ignoring the issues with Keybase encouraging key escrow by "allowing" or encouraging key upload (!!!), I don't think it helps. Perhaps as a basis on which to build a web-of-trust that can be transposed into newer cryptosystems, but the key escrow part makes falsification of trust a real possibility.
Anyway, maybe that's just me.

To a libertarian, inflation is a "bug", but not necessarily to others. Models that allow infinite inflation over a long time-period are different economic models, rather than badly implemented crypto-code.
Personally, I think inherently deflationary is a bad economic model, so I'd be more inclined towards an inflationary currency.

I did for a while, but then I moved hardware and didn't see any reason to set up PGP again. At best, it was a signal to people that I cared about security/privacy, at worst it was making everything I posted non-repudiable for no useful reason.
The fact that miniLock is authenticated but repudiable makes it a better bet for PGP-usecase purposes *anyway*, and my minilock ID is in my signature (again, had lapsed by accident) for people who want to use miniLock outside of peerio.
But, miniLock isn't (opportunistic pun) "turn-key", it requires launching, authenticating, dropping a file to encrypt, typing in a miniLock ID to encrypt to (encrypting to yourself probably makes it non-repudiable if someone acquires your private key, beware!), downloading the encrypted file, and then transmitting the encrypted file Now, implementing Peerio server is something I endorse. If I weren't too busy, I'd investigate doing it myself, it looks like fun. If anyone does feel like it, they have miniLock for JS-based servers, and deadLock for Python-based servers (needs some work/bugfixes).

This is correct; Peerio uses MiniLock under the hood for crypto, and private keys for minilock are generated deterministically; when you "log out" the key is not stored permanently (although JS can't wipe RAM so a closer-to-metal client would be nice).

They're in free beta, my understanding is they'll charge for storage. There's not much that can be done to wind back the crypto as it's all client-side, and if their server were shut down, as I've mentioned before, the server behaviour is all documented on Github.
One useful way to look at this: GPG is what most recommend for crypto, but it's metadata rich and requires usually closed platforms to distribute ciphertexts (you may not use Yahooglesoft but your recipients will usually). In recent discussions on this list, the use of a centralised key distribution *company*, keybase, has also been accepted to some extent (though I'm not too happy..).
miniLock is designed as a spiritual descendent of PGP with many use-case improvements and a much simpler threat model. You can use miniLock instead of GPG across email, and it will leak less metadata than GPG by virtue of using ephemeral keys that don't directly link a message to its sender or recipients.
Peerio is like Gmail plus Keybase for miniLock; it serves exactly those purposes. We would all (me emphatically included) rather if it ran on a store/forward PGP mixnet, provided it retained good UX to appeal to the masses, but right now, it's a centralised service that hides the content and format of communications while unavoidably having total access to the metadata of from who, to whom, and when.
So yea, centralised and closed ain't good. They are the warts I'd like to see fixed with a federated and/or mixed backend. But the frontend is just as open as GPG is, and we already generally endorse the use of open front-ends to work around closed back-ends.
I may be motivated soon to re-implement miniLock in Go as a learning excercise (still a Golang noob here), in which case it could be a short hop from there to a server/client implementation for Peerio, too. But, I'm not committed to that yet and have written not an `iota` of code yet, so by all means beat me to it.

Indeed, the Pirates are seriously punching above their weight in terms of influence in EU. So much so that the other "mainstream" parties have started adopting pirate policies to greater/lesser extents; this actually lead to a drop in pirate votes, but on balance it's a good sign.
Now, Julia Reda is in charge of the draft proposals for copyright reform in the EU. They put a pirate in charge of that. And, she's done broad consultations through net and otherwise, she's publicised every visit from lobbyists, and she's released an evidence-heavy report with recommendations for serious reform; not the hardcore pirate outcome, but something no other kind of EU politician would have come out with.
Amelia and Julia are rockstars. I've been waiting and poking for a Pirate Party in Ireland to form so I can try and send more quality MEPs over to Brussels but we always lag behind on my island. :)

Without getting into the issue of whether patents encourage innovation.. I do think that medical devices are a special case. If you have a heart implant, that thing needs to be "unhackable", but also totally verifiably safe. So there should be firmware signing, no mutable state, verifiable memory safety...but the code should be open source, and if need be the firmware signing key for each device (needs to be different for each device!) should be accessible by a legitimate owner.

Are we sure about this? JS loaded from localhost can do some dangerous stuff because CORS doesn't apply anymore to local resources such as the filesystem. What context does pdf.js run in? If Mozilla didn't carefully sandbox it, and if it executes PDF Javascript embeds (does it?) then it could potentially have filesystem access?
This would mean that the closed-source spyware platform from Google might actually be safer in this case. But I don't know; pdf.js might be injected into the remote resource and therefore have CORS restrictions tied to the source domain. It's all implementation..
I'd be inclined to use pdfotext for textual data or GIMP as Steve recommended. You can probably use some combination of common PDF utils, headless GIMP, and ImageMagick to make a script to do the same thing

In fact, it's worse. DNT, if set either way, is another pure bit of browser entropy; it actually *assists* certain forms of tracking, because it can be expected to remain invariant between visits of a given This is just one of the things making me think the "web" needs a total re-boot to redesign for security from the boots-up. Servers shouldn't require user-agents to know how to treat visitors. Scripting is useful for a rich experience but should be more sand-boxable (ideally, scripts can be sandboxed to their position in the DOM tree!) and tightly permission'd. Canvas and other elements should behave deterministically; this should be part of browser test-suites. Browsers should be allowed cache fonts but not disclose to the server whether they have a font in their cache or not.
DNT was another nail in the coffin. Either a browser can be tracked by design, or it can't.

Underfunded, understaffed, but also the only reason why Facebook's facial recognition database was rolled back in Europe. Well, we're told it was rolled back, which I don't believe for an instant. Point being, the DPC has done a fantastic job with the shoestring our government gives it.
All of which is beside my point: I wasn't saying the Irish government's great and that Ireland's a safe-haven from spying; it's not. We have GCHQ sitting on all of our fibres, and we *do* host some of the world's biggest NSA assets: Facebook, Google, Amazon, etcetera.
My point was that our *government* does not engage, as far as we know, in mass surveillance, and that receiving government funding in Ireland to study and deploy privacy projects would therefore be less worrisome than receiving the same funding from the UK or US, which presents the well-trodden paradox of being "funded by the adversary".

I have to agree that these days I don't see elections, as currently performed, as being effective at representing the population.
Case in point, here in Ireland we have Proportional Representation, which helps to prevent a two-party system and means that we are more likely to achieve a voting outcome that satisfies (or dissatisfies) the most people; a compromise, instead of a strategically voted least-worst.
However, we still have the problem that only a wealthy person can run for office, in the same way that only a wealthy person can take the risk of "boot-strapping" a company or take any comparable risk. So, only wealthy people get represented, and thus regular or disadvantaged people get little representation.
Far better, I think, to take a statistically relevant sample of the population on a rolling basis: Liquid Sortition.
If I had my way, one of our houses of government would be pure liquid sortition, the other would be a form of liquid democracy, and instead of a president we'd call a large jury for each legislative change that might require constitutional oversight.
But I won't get my way. :)

Well, it wasn't made-up, he donated to an anti-equality campaign (which is his right!) but put Mozilla's name next to his vote, which is not OK.
They didn't fire him IIRC, he stepped down after a wave of criticism which was probably excessive. Still, if I were a Mozillan I wouldn't want a CEO who had a prior history of using the company name to forward a personal religious agenda, no matter how great a developer he is.
All of which is outside scope for this list, so I'll stop there.
Firefox Hello, which might be to blame, is on-topic though; is that module even open source? Mozilla are really sinking fast (ahem, EME) as a thought-leading ideology hub, so it wouldn't surprise me to learn they were bundling closed-source-open-port-ware.

Thanks for that perspective; from without, it looked like he was adding it voluntarily to tie his funding to Mozilla.
I still stand by the right of employees to protest an employer who votes against their rights, but my opinion of Eich is marginally higher, knowing that he wasn't deliberately tarnishing Mozilla for his own agenda.
I strongly disagree with his views, but I respect that he has a right to have them. If his views conflict with his suitability for a role or employment though, that's entirely on him and I don't see that it deserves a white-wash. We're soon to have a referendum on marriage equality here in Ireland, and if my employer were campaigning actively against it (they are not!), I'd be quick to raise my voice.

The downside of using a faraday cage with an activated phone: The phone will start "screaming" looking for a tower, and you'll get much reduced battery life. Turning phone off first and *then* putting it in the bag saves battery and prevents any suspected "backup battery" driven chips from getting a signal out..although if that's your threat-model, they could just record whatever telemetry they need and send later.
i.e., if a phone is suspected to be compromised and could turn on the core or auxiliary chips (with main or backup battery), and activate the microphone or camera, the faraday cage bag will prevent it from sending that data right away but it could be instructed to store that data instead and send it back later.
Personally I think removing the battery is sufficient for most phone models; the backup batteries are unlikely to be enough to drive the more concerning chips and sensors for long even if they're wired up to it in the first place.

Well, we're imagining systems set up deliberately to be beneficient. If someone wants to create an awful orwellian thing instead, they can do so; with enough guns they'll get everyone to register to anything.
So, leaving aside the non-technical question of "what if the creators are assholes with guns", let's get back to the core question; how to implement a fairly OK "Basic Income On Blockchain".
Firstly, basic income is the sort of system that you can likely only do with an external registrar for person:key correspondance, because we've never cracked the sock-puppet/sybil problem and might never do.
This registrar need not actually be able to *track* these people once registered, though; that's the whole idea behind blind signatures for voting, for example. The registrar could be asked by a person to sign their basic income allowance to any (evenly divisive of the income) number of sub-addresses, which would be blinded from the registrar, and the funds could then be redeemed zerocoin-style as income by the registrant. The registrar "knows" that someone's just claimed their income, but not to what addresses, and can therefore prevent double-claims. The registrant gets their income to one or many bitcoin addresses and can then generate new receiving addresses as usual for the Of course, this might all be meaningless if you just used zerocoin instead, because with zerocoin you could just collect your coins openly in your own name, launder them trivially, and move on.

I *gather* (without much attribution/citation wise) that it'll be pseudo-client-side, with lists of topics being downloaded from Mozilla, and click-data being (poorly) obfuscated in return as "user clicked *some link in this set*".
Not impressed, at all. This is a pattern, though;
1. Organisation wins favour by appealing to technically competent people who recommend organisation's product to less technically competent friends and family.
2. Organisation's user-base grows and organisation refocuses on a generally-applicable brand. Hackers still happy because decline takes time.
3. Organisation starts ignoring early-adopters and hacker-advocates who made it popular to begin with. Hackers ditch it.
4. Organisation coasts along on existing lay-customer-base for ages.
5. Organisation is replaced by an upstart that probably wins favour through early adopters and hacker-advocates.
People don't listen to geeks on the "important" stuff, like "Don't post your credit card selfie to twitter", but when they want a recommendation for a good web browser, chat client, or model of phone, they do. And companies forget this the moment they've crested that wave.

I'm not one to call parents who surveil children "Orwellian": a parent's job is to prepare a child for the world and protect them from the world. Some parent:child combos are trusting and the children are sane. Others, not; and it is *not* always the parent's fault if their kids aren't well-behaved human beings as teens.
That said, it's a teenager's prerogative to explore what it means to be an adult as they approach the day they take ownership of themselves, and to push boundaries and make mistakes. So, push-back and assertion of self and future rights is normal, too.

Real estate is only valuable if people can afford to rent it.
Bitcoin is already wildly price-manipulated by bots, true market value iimpossible to determine. In an economy crunch currencies universally suffer because they represent a medium of exchange only. Bitcoin especially so: it's a pure algorithmic abstraction of fiat value, worth literally nothing except that which both parties in a transaction agree upon.
Best way IMO: reduce your dependencies, rational-prepper style, and reduce your attack surface when the debts are called. Pay off debt now, buy insulation, solar panels. Learn a lot of DIY to maintain your lifestyle if you can't afford to pay others to do so. Learn a valuable skill in a future market crunch: hint, programming and encryption probably don't count much in case of total economic collapse.
Bear in mind that this isn't gonna happen quickly if it happens. It'll be slow, stepwise. Economic catastrophies every 5 years or so, progressively making the world a little shitter every time. The frantic dead-cat-bounce each time will be.more brittle and more loudly celebrated. Sound familiar? :)
The winning play, though by far the hardest, is to create an economic enclave that conserves local value and builds community resilience. Local currency would be cool, along with robust local mesh networking and local communication / broadcast media. Goal: when money outside your community declines, your currency exchange value can just change to compensate and thereby encourage local purchasing and export.
So, do we need an "economy in a box"; buy 100 cheap mesh networking boxes (black-swift.net?), burn in currency/message exchange software, install in local houses, distribute localised "economy in a box" apps to locals? It's something I'd love to see.

TBF, Servo is kind of a total rewrite of exactly the sort the world needs: memory and type safe from the ground up.
What Servo needs then (besides 'completion') is a type/memory safe JS engine to replace Gecko, and likewise a LibreSSL-like replacement for OpenSSL.
While they've got nothing to lose though, they should go further than a mere reboot. They should resume *leading* FFS, for example by making their JS engine strict by default so they become the go-to development browser again. "If it works on FF it will work anywhere" would be a nice selling point I think.
They should also take privacy seriously and totally rethink their funding model. Patreon? Premium versions? I don't care, almost anything but built-in ads and bloatware will do. Baking in P2P in a real way would be nice. WebRTC-based replacement for Bittorrent Sync? Peer to Peer calls using Jitsi instead of (vomit) "Hello"? P2P filesharing and content publication, backed by subscription for "available while I'm offline"?
Loads of scope for Mozilla and not enough vision. I hate Google more than what Mozilla are becoming but that doesn't mean I'm proud to use FF. It kills my battery, WebRTC is still broken, and it keeps getting worse.

There's two categories or buckets here if you're playing to win; One is a list of extensions you can install on *anyone's* computer without them even noticing the privacy/security boost they're receiving (because if they notice, you lose because they blame the new *ware for all their trivial problems). The other list is the power-user stuff that really works, but which n00bs will reject out of ignorance, blaming the protective software instead of the buggy websites it exposes.
My short-list for install-on-everyone's-computer is:
* Disconnect
* HTTPS-Everywhere
* uBlock Origin (don't change default settings)
* Disable 3rd Party Cookies
NoScript, Cookie-killers, RequestPolicy etcetera are too prone to creating problems for browser users; to an enlightened user, blame the website, work around, or make an exception and move on. But to a n00b, exposing errors in tracker-rich sites is unacceptable, sadly.

TBF, nobody's going to make that Privacy-Respecting laptop if people reject the "most privacy respecting laptop so far" for not being good enough. Because, we can keep moving the goalposts, here.
Librem isn't perfect, and its BIOS isn't fully free. But it's free-er than almost any other laptop being sold that's worth owning, and it even comes with a hardware switch for some key sensors.
I could ask for more, but bitching and rejecting the Librem because it's not-good-enough, and buying a laptop with NO respect for me on the basis that "I can just roll my own", continues to send the market the message 1) Free software doesn't sell

Absolutely, yes; If you ask first for privacy, and there is a good option for privacy, then that's the correct answer.
Privacy without free software is a total joke.
Ergo, given a potentially spyware rich platform that *markets* itself as Private, as Google, Apple and Microsoft for example *all do*, or a free software platform which can be trivially and fairly-well rewritten to not be spyware-rich, you choose the latter.
It follows that for a privacy respecting laptop, you must necessarily begin with a laptop that can, to some degree of certainty, be wiped clean and installed with trustworthy software.
There are many options here; the FSF certify hardware that can be as blob-free as possible. There are also lots of pitfalls, because the Linux architecture in many places implicitly trusts the intentions of device firmwares; it's likely that memory checks aren't implemented well enough on so many layers that you can never be sure without literally CMOSing your own device control hardware.
Given all these options and pitfalls, draw a "sanity line" somewhere and pick some hardware that lets you do modern stuff without torturously long waits. In that short-list, the Librem still ranks quite well, I feel.

Usability is *very* noob-friendly, just define a private URL or get one
from the server on first-visit, and send to friends. They open the link,
and are dropped into chat-server. The hardest UX part of Jitsi meet is
teaching people to click "Allow Camera and Mic" on first visit.. you'd
be surprised how big a deal this is for people actually.
In fact, the difficulty getting people to click just that one button to
use Jitsi Meet may be what finally broke my spirit and made me realise
that users are quite often too stupid to successfully use *anything* and
that only brand reputation makes them persevere to use shit like Skype.

Bittorrent's stuff is always closed and obscure. Don't trust.
Ages back I live-tweeted (topical!) my explorations into BTSync back when they were claiming 256 bit AES. Suffice toto say.. no. They were using AES256 with a 20-something-byte key..base32 encoded. I don't even.
They'll happily advertise security while not even grasping that entropy doesn't increase with encoding overheads.
