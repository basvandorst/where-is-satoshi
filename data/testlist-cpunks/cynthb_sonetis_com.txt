@_subject: From the "pissing up a rope" file... 
Results pasted in from                   Now, here are the results from last week's question
                  which asked....
                  Should there be one international group that
                  governs and controls web content?
                  85% said no...
                  while 15% said yes.
Interesting that the "sheeple factor" was as high as 15%.  (Or was it higher? Did 20 cypherpunks submit "no" 100 times each?)
This poll was accurate within 100%, 19 times out of 20 ;-) , but it
will still serve as fodder for someone's News Breaking Story.  At
the very least they could have implemented a "have-you-voted-yet"
cookie to weed out the technologically impaired who might want to
vote twice.

If you're trying to destroy a standard IC, why don't you just hook up the
power and ground pins to a 120V AC outlet?  No special equipment or
substances required, just a couple of wires.  Done it myself, and some
chips make a really neat popping sound as the top blows off :-)

If Mr. Jack-Boots And Friends are standing behind you, it's too late
anyways.  You certainly won't have time to dig out the thermite /
magnesium, place it on the appropriate chip, and ignite it.  If you're
going to the trouble of rigging up an emergency destructo-circuit, you
might as well make sure you have something that fries the chip / PCMCIA
card completely. E-mail:     cynthb at iosphere.net  | PGP Key:  See Home Page

True, if you haven't installed a circuit in advance with some sort of
switch or circuit breaker to kick in when the PC's cover is opened (in
your absence), or the Big Red Button beside your PC is pushed (in your
presence).  Assuming you're dealing with a PCMCIA card, it would be easy
to rig up an alternate "reader" to fry the card as soon as it's plugged
in. All of this has been done before - most high-security crypto devices have
built-in zeroisation / tamper response. And no, I'm not sufficiently paranoid to have this on _my_ home PC.

load of B.S. questioning her right and ability to be there.  The ones that
keep at it long enough to graduate are the ones that *really* want to do whatever it is, and IMHO are more likely to try harder.
- If she has been in business for a while, this means she has attracted
and kept customers in spite of the attitude displayed in previous posts. There are no "quotas" in the marketplace. - I wonder whether the garage owners have any preference.  In my military
experience (Signals officer), the (older male) sergeants and chiefs, when
given a choice, preferred female radar / radio technicians to male

more pleasant to deal with. Chicken and Egg: How much of "each sex [is] better suited to different

Acknowledged, agree to disagree :-).  (Very few of my male friends
can do more than sew on a button, but that doesn't weight my choice
of a *professional* tailor.)  It did, however, sound like you were
agreeing with the previous poster's (more extreme) position.
Agreed (sadly) that there is a dearth of role models like Mme. Curie
or Roberta Bondar.
There is also an unfortunate "geek stigma" often attached to those
who are good at math or science (male or female). Whether this stigma
discourages more girls than boys is questionable (psychology thesis,
anyone?), but it has probably resulted in good-math-potential brains
taking economics (or whatever) instead.  Fewer competitors for the

I used "spam" to mean scripted commercial solicitations, by a human
or robot, based on a list of names and numbers.  I'm not sure whether
this is the same definition as in the legislation. My understanding is that the legislation restricts commercial solicitations by phone to:
- certain times of day (not after 9 PM? unsure)
- one initial call, and no follow-ups if the person explicitly asks
the caller to never phone this number again (again, unsure of legal
I don't consider this scenario overly restrictive, since it gives
_them_ a chance to sell their product, and _me_ a chance to have them
delete my name from their database.  Unfortunately, without some
formal means of redress, very few telemarketers seem to remember that
they are unlikely to find new customers if they call at 7 AM Saturday
for the third time this month.
What means of redress would you suggest, in the absence of
legislation / fines, to someone who has been called repeatedly by a
telemarketer?  This person is not a current customer and so cannot
withdraw his/her business.

For starters, root is the all-powerful system administrator account on
UNIX machines, and 127.0.0.1 is the "loopback" or "localhost" IP address,
generally used for testing.  A connection to loopback amounts to a
software connection back to the originating host, and e-mail sent to
loopback won't even go out the Ethernet card / modem / whatever.
So, if I put root at 127.0.0.1 in the "From:" field of my news reader's
configuration, all of my posts will give this as my e-mail address. Depending on the news reader, I may have to set options like "override
default domain name", which would override my service provider's name.
Since many commercial mailer programs ("SpamBots") scan Usenet news posts
for potential target e-mail addresses, these programs will pick up my
phony e-mail address and send their junk to their own system administrator
instead of me :-)
The smarter programs will also scan the bottom of posts for e-mail
addresses in people's signatures (or .sig files).  The "spam-busted"
address described above could be anything that is not a verbatim copy of
my e-mail address, for example:
c.y.n.t.h.b at i.o.s.p.h.e.r.e.dot.n.e.t
Any reasonably computer-literate human will be able to figure out what my
real address is, but a cut-and-paste by a software robot won't work.

Personally, I choose to press the "Delete" key myself.

Agreed, and said private individual can do as s/he sees fit.  My only

on monitor emissions - you can read the screen someone's looking at, and not just the key-clicks.  Won't get you blanked-out passwords, though.  Much of the monitor's emissions may be out the back.
Other places to look for emissions: the power supply, and the connection points for peripherals.  Make sure you leave adequate ventilation, though (another tricky part).

True, but the highway brigands did pose a danger.  Additionally,
wandering nobility could (and did) commandeer attractive young
peasants of either gender for a "visit".  The consequences
(psychological and/or physical) for these young peasants were
Potable water is also a fairly recent innovation.  Beer and wine were
generally much safer (before they went sour, that is) than the raw
sewage that flowed downstream from the next village.  Humans have
been chewing various leaves, roots, etc. for millenia. Some of these
"natural" items are just as intoxicating as so-called "hard drugs".
SCA leanings notwithstanding, you cannot convince me that life back
then was "freer" than now.  Peasants could not leave their land,
shopkeepers and artisans were limited by the guilds, and nobles were
obliged to comply with the wishes of their "superiors" or be
labelled traitors.  Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is another useful argument here - people were so concerned with feeding and clothing themselves that they did not have time to concern themselves with niceties like freedom.
A professor of medieval studies once said that the most accurate
depiction of Ye Goode Olde Life is in Monty Python's "Holy Grail",
in the "Bring Out Yer Dead" scene.  ("Must be a king."  "Why?" "He
hasn't got sh*t all over 'im.")

I agree wholeheartedly.  Uncontrolled guns do not solve problems, they create them.  If most households have at least one firearm, it makes it that much easier for a criminal to obtain one by stealing yours while you are at work.
Canada may be regulated to death according to most libertarians, but I for
one like it that way.  I can walk alone and unarmed at night in Ottawa,
Toronto, etc. without fearing for my life.  Can a female resident of
Washington or New York say the same?  Our schools do not have metal detectors
at the entrances because they are not needed. IMNSHO the best way to fight crime is not with bigger guns than the "bad
guys", but with better social programs such as universal health care, and
improved day care so single parents can show their kids what a productive
lifestyle looks like.  This takes longer than blowing the brains out of some
teenager that feels his only path to a better life is through crime, and it
doesn't give the same adrenalin rush.  However, it works at the source of
crime, and not the consequences. Cynthia, unrepentant bleeding-heart liberal

Not identical, but we have large groups from various parts of the world,
and we are by no means ethnically uniform.  The two most numerous, of
French and British Isles descent, have very different cultures; Vancouver has large communities from Asia; etc. etc. And my brush is no broader than the "all government workers are lazy, corrupt little power-trippers"
mantra that appears here so often, uncontested. Granted that the guns are a symptom and not the underlying problem.  However, having them readily available makes it that much more likely that a person will do something regrettable in a fit of rage (or just plain annoyance).
Our history is not squeaky clean either, but at least we're trying to settle things by negotiation and referenda instead of violence.
Agreed.  There are also dedicated, hard-working, community-oriented policemen out there. (I'm probably going to get flamed for daring to say that, but tough.)

Practically speaking, using the cable TV infrastructure looks much more
promising than the power grid.  Pros: - already available in many major urban centres = less retrofit
- theoretical 30Mbps transmission rate (not fibre, but still pretty good)
- lack of standardisation / compatibility for the modems themselves (bleeding edge technology, surprise surprise)
- little choice for your ISP
- you may have to buy cable service along with the Internet connectivity

Could be a typo for PCS, which is similar to GSM but uses the 1.9 GHz band
instead of 900 MHz (GSM) or 1.8 GHz (DCS). Unfortunately, I don't think
there are dual-mode phones yet.
