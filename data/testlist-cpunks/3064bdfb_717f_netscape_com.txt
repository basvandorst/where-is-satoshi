@_subject: Netscape for Linux? 
Does this mean that a Linux version of Netscape will no longer be available, or that it *will* be available but unsupported?
That all depends on what you mean by "support".  If you mean "we will no longer make Netscape available for the Linux platform", that's not support.  If you mean "we will no longer respond to bug reports for Netscape on this platform" then that's discontinuing support.
Please be more specific in your postings?
As a project manager and developer, I have constructed many a business case for the development and/or support for products - such a case could easily be made for Linux support for Netscape, irrespective of what you mean by "support".
