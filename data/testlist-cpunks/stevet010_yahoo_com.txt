Quoting Trei, Peter (ptrei at rsasecurity.com):
I stand corrected.  I'm even reading a short bit about Nokia's new 3g phone:
        "The device, known as the Nokia 6650, is also notable for allowing
        users to record up to 20 seconds of video (128x96 pixels) with sound
        using a built in VGA camera employing 4096 colours, the first Nokia
        phone to offer the facility...."
        "Other features include a multimedia messaging service (MMS) client, a
        WAP 1.2.1-compatible browser, integrated Bluetooth, a "wallet"
        application for mobile transactions, and a Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME)
        virtual machine based on the mobile information device profile
        (MIDP)."
Includes infrared and USB as well.  Not much quickly available describing the
wallet app, but it probably isn't peer-to-peer.
IOW, a decent number of platforms are ready to go.  Cool.
