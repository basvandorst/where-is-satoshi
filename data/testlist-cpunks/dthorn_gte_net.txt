It appears to me that PGP encryption et al is really 1940's technology, albeit fancied up by 1990's computers.  Why use keys and cyphers when all you should have to do is maximize the randomization of bits in a script?  Big computers should not be able to de-randomize such encoding, since the permutations/combinations would be astronomical after just a half-dozen or so random number initializations, as well as the fact that the bits are relatively undifferentiated (just ones and zeros) and are not maintained with their original bytes, words, paragraphs, or pages?

Fraud is fraud.  It's illegal under *some* statute, I'm sure.
Fraud.  See above.
According to the Constitution, "No title of nobility shall be granted by
the United States, and no person holding any office of profit or trust
under them shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any
present, emolument, office or title, of any kind whatsoever, from any
king, prince, or foreign state."
I would point out that the "any kind whatsoever" clause is clear enough,
and as to whether Congress approved Bush et al for these honors, well,
you tell me.
Demjanjuk.  Israel (a country where the Justice department seems to have
some ethics) was so embarrassed about this that they released him, even
though there was considerable pressure to keep him under various charges.
One could also look at the Weaver and Waco cases for false charges.
It's worthy of note that juries rejected the U.S. Justice dept's murder
charges in these cases.  The original charges in the Weaver case even
included the baby, as I recall.

In the interest of reducing the amount of argument, let's speak more
precisely:  I think people *do* have the right to demand such a thing,
although they do *not* necessarily have the right to force such a thing.
Perhaps there is a thin line between "demand" and "protest", but most
subscribers should be able to figure it out.
I can't argue the responsibility part.  As far as the size issue, it was
raised (sadly) several days and hundreds of postings *after* Dimitri was
excommunicated from the list, by none other than T.C. May.  Tsk, tsk.
I made note to this list time and time again requesting that people not
state the obvious - who owns what hardware and what rights they have to
pull the plug or whatever.  I seriously doubt that even the least
intelligent cypherpunk would misunderstand such a thing. Do you really
believe that myself and other cypherpunks want to "seize" John's equip-
ment, morally or otherwise?  You are correct about certain issues being
complex, but one of the big failings of the crowd who supported Gilmore
on this action was their failure to understand the point I've made here -
that we *do* understand basic property rights, etc.
How can I say this better?  Myself and a number of other people would
really have appreciated it if John had defended himself.  The fact of
all these other would-be experts on cyber-rights and morals preaching
to the list on behalf of Gilmore, and Gilmore being silent, argues
(not proves, just argues) heavily in favor of Dimitri et al.

Why bother with theory?  By January sometime, I ought to have my own

orphaned children, we both work (good paying corporate jobs), yet it
appears we'll be collecting at least $1400 per month tax-free for the
kiddies, from various agencies, not including medical/dental benefits.
I'd guess the medical/dental will be worth $300, so $1700 divided by
172.5 (or 173.33) work hours is $9.80 to $9.85 per hour after taxes.
Imagine what it would be if we were also collecting for the grownups.
This is in the greater L.A. area.  It looks like the bigger the family,

Since I wasn't on the Internet before, the answer is no.
As to Dale insisting on Gilmore providing services, the answer to that
is clear if you actually read my posts, which you apparently claim to
have done, yet claim not to have done since you "gave up" a long time
ago.  Which is it, Tim?
Tim May writes on certain topics a la "Crypto Anarchy and Virtual
Communities" with a passion that is compelling, if not entirely
convincing, yet this "leader of cypherpunks" is pitifully out of his
element dealing with a truly rational person such as myself, since in
Tim's universe, emotion seems to be the more desirable substitute.
BTW, I never suggested guilt via not answering up to the list on any
topic.  I said it would have been clearer to the list subscribers if
John had explained things himself instead of having a plethora of
defenses coming from hacks like yourself, who don't represent John.
If you, Sandy, and the other offenders *really* want to keep the noise
down, then next time ask John directly for a reply, and if none is
forthcoming, say to the list *once*, "John will not answer up", etc.,
and let the subscribers draw their own conclusions from the silence,
instead of from your inane "defenses".

Thanks for a curteous reply.  I believe that my idea above is still a
great idea (if the subscribers are not afraid of confrontation), as it
would tend to force the issue more into the open.
You mention what "others had overlooked".  How about this: Tim May sent
a message the other day stating (in essence) that the whole "censorship"
thing was pretty much a size (rather than content) problem.  I posted
that notion twice, and there has been *no* discussion of it, as far as
I know.  Too bad Tim didn't post that at the beginning of the affair,
since everyone apparently reads *his* mail.
Can I speculate here?  The nature of the list, as pertains to messaging,
is fairly quick response for most postings.  I'm sure you realize that
that raises the emotional content quite a bit, as would be lessened if
people typed out their responses and then sat on them (and reviewed them)
for a day or so before re-posting. I have no problem with *any* discussion
that any subscriber feels necessary, but frankly, when I add it all up,
the pro-Gilmore faction went way overboard restating ad nauseam to the
effect that "John can do whatever he wants, and y'all can take a hike".
I apologize in advance for this one, but I honestly think that statement
says more about acceptance of the Iron Boot principle than it says about
what really happened.  I for one am not an insider in any of the various
cliques that surround this list, so perhaps I missed something that would
explain it better to me.  I suppose you are referring to an unspoken
understanding, but again, and for future reference, you might want to
consider the non-long-time members and speak the unspoken, as it were.

It's very simple, really.  Don't *anyone* speak for John, since John

the real reason(s), and anyone else's explanation is going to sound
hollow and unconvincing.  Doesn't anyone get the point?  John took the
action, you didn't, so either he explains or he doesn't, but I don't
think other people trying to explain for him accomplishes anything
except creating more bad feelings on the list.
No, I didn't mean that.  We've seen enough of that already.
Sounds good to me.  I don't try to keep track of who says what over a
period of time, which makes it easier to forget unpleasantness after
it settles down, even if other people don't forget my unpleasant moods
when I wish they would.
Maybe I shouldn't admit this openly, then, but I thought that admission
from Tim was quite significant, given both the physical limitations of
the processing hardware and phone lines, and Tim's apparent influence
with c-punks people, including (I would certainly guess) John Gilmore.
Convenience and practicality are certainly compelling, but...
Oh, I *do* understand.  I think personal privacy is sacred, even for
underage people who are frequently robbed of it unfairly by older people
and by bullies.  That's only one of the reasons I found the "Crypto

If you could analogize the list to a human society, then you might
understand that a pattern of decadence can set in here as it does in
the more visible society, as is run from Washington DC, etc.

I would guess that those who became and remained successful technically
(as opposed to becoming "business people") were using HP computers and
such in the 1970s.  I for one was a heavy user then, and PETs, Apples,

Let's talk about some real data processing.  dBase II on CP/M computers
(or certain proprietary hardware with adaptor cards), circa 1980-1982,
would be a good example.  If you had the right stuff, say, an HP-120 or
HP-125, or even an 80 series with the adaptor, and HP floppy drives, you
could process all day long for (years?) with scarcely a hitch.  You try
to put something like that on an Apple II with Apple floppies (using
whatever software was available), and you couldn't do the job.  The
machine and/or drives would quit in a few days, if not the first day,
and might even erase your diskettes in the process (a common occurrence
in those days).
In early 1985, just for fun, I had an HP-71 pocket computer hooked up to
a LaserJet printer and a couple of HP portable floppies, and printed my
store's databases on it.  Multiple indexes, thousands of records, each
index printed complete every day in separate copies for each salesman.
I wouldn't dream of trying that with an IBM or Apple floppy system.
Hard disks?  I *never* heard of an HP microcomputer hard disk crash in
those days, short of dropping the computer onto the floor while writing
a file.  We used to pull the wall plugs on our HP's while writing to a
file, with no bad effect.  Try that on an IBM or Apple circa <= 1985.
Computer hardware?  One thing I enjoyed doing for customers was pulling
a RAM card out of an HP-86 while it was running a program, then forcing
the card back into the slot.  Usually pulling the card had no effect,
then, putting it back in would generally reset the program.
Surge protectors?  Never sold one.  Not needed with HP's then.
An Apple II (like the other toy computers from 1975 to 1982) was a
hobbyist computer, which required frequent cleaning and scrubbing
internally to keep it running.  A pencil eraser was a common tool...
And let's not forget Apple and IBM attitudes: When I had HP's, if I ever
needed service, HP did it themselves, professionally (using static mats
etc.) and promptly.  You wouldn't find Apple or IBM offering to repair
their own microcomputers in those days (or ever).  For good reason!
Cost of service?  HP's contracts were usually 3% to 5% of the item cost
per year, compared to the "industry standard" of 15%.  Not a bad deal.

[snip my text]
I hope you find this interesting (or amusing):
When I worked at Olympic Sales in El Segundo (2/81 thru 3/83), Saturday
was the big shopping day for electronics goodies, and the Hughes, Northrop
etc. guys would pile in with their kids and have a good time pestering
the OS salespeople.
I made a lot of observations and notes, and one of the truly fascinating
was how, when parents would bring the kids in, the kids would be faced
with Commodores, Ataris, TIs, Apples, and HPs, all on and running [but
the non-HPs would almost always be running some video software (games
usually) and the HPs would have a text screen up], and the kids would
most often make a beeline for the HP-87s and HP-85s.  Particularly the
younger kids, say, 8 to 12 years old.
The argument at the time (as I recall) was that the parents were right
to steer the kids over to the Apples and Ataris, since they didn't cost
an arm and a leg. It it had been my dad, though, he would have forgone
the Apple until he could get the HP, which is a big part of the reason
I'm able to do what I do today.  More power to dads like mine (in spite
of failings here and there)!

The phrase "your beloved HPs" gives your hand away.  The truth is, many
customers I knew would reiterate exactly what you said. But when I would
press for details, I would find that they were *very* lightweight apps,
and the ability to deliver day in day out was essentially nonexistent.
BTW, I don't see above where you said what would happen to the IBMs or
Apples when the power shut off while writing to the hard disk....
And Apples and IBMs *did* require surge protectors, not provided by the
manufacturer.  And neither Apple or IBM would repair their own stuff.
This last point is very important to me, but I can see where it would
be lost on non-professional users.
HPs were made for use in less than ideal environments, which is why:
1. When you use an HP or Apple in lots of areas of Southern California,
particularly close to the ocean where most people live, the HP will
perform for a long time and the Apple will corrode rather quickly.
2. When I went to a show in Anaheim once in the summer, and the air
conditioning quit, and the temperature reached 100+ fahrenheit in the
display areas, the HPs were the only micros still running.
3. As far as calculators go, try leaving several CMOS machines in your
locked car with windows up in the summer for, say, 3 or 4 hours while
you're inside of a mall, to name an example.  See which ones still have
their CMOS data intact.
To sum up, when you haven't had to depend on professional gear for real
production work at home or on the road, you can't make these kinds of
judgements knowledgeably.  The main gripe I have about postings like
this is that they argue on emotion about a technical issue.
HP is far from a *good* company these days.  Matter of fact, the day
that they introduced the HP-150 (touchscreen) computer, they yanked the
engineers off the new-item rollout team and replaced them with IBM PC
dodos who knew nothing about HP. This is very similar to what Volkswagen
did when they dumped the reliability ads for the Beetle and started
cranking up the sexy ads for the Rabbit.  That's when Honda started to
eat Volkswagen's lunch, 20 years and running.  I can see clearly where
this strategy put HP a lot of years behind the competition.  You will
recall, of course, that HP started this whole thing with the first-ever
personal (take it home and plug it in and start programming in Fortran
immediately) computer, the 2116A, in 1966.  Expensive, yes, but still
by every technical account a personal computer.
In case you haven't noticed, and in spite of HP being full of assholes
these days (I don't use that term lightly), HP has gained market share
in PCs (not just printers) against Apple and IBM by a factor of several
times.  HP is now  in the PC server market, for example.  How Compaq
got to be  I don't know, since when I worked in Pasadena we couldn't
leave the machines on all day, since none of them would last more than
3 weeks that way.

First, let me apologize for something I try never to do.  When someone
sends private email, if I put it to the list I should remove the sender's
name (if no permission given).
I still use HP personal computers, since (despite their problems) they
are still the most effective at running for a long time and processing
a lot of data.  As far as showing your hand, I find it interesting how
many erstwhile serious users will nonetheless wave away any discussion
of the specific problems computers have (particularly the early ones),
which I can only relate to denial.  In the words of Consumer Reports
back in the early-mid 1980s, "These electronic items are the least
reliable and most problematic things we've ever tested" (quote approximate).
I never said it was impossible to use an Apple (or early IBM) for serious
work of *some* kind, i.e., simple spreadsheet work.  What I said and I
hope it came through is this:
If you were using an IBM mainframe in the period 1980-1982 or thereabouts,
you would have what I call unreliable equipment, but, you would probably
also have IBM person(s) on site to keep the stuff running.  On the other
hand, IBM PC users (outside of large corporate sites) didn't necessarily
have that luxury, therefore, if they tried to do what I could easily do
with HP personal computer equipment, their IBM PCs would die and have to
be fixed "by the dealer", with more consequent unreliability added.
How many people have you heard of who could run databases on an IBM or
Apple II floppy system, entering data with fairly large files and several
indexes, and searching and printing the data almost continuously?  Those
people who know what I'm talking about should have a good laugh on that one.

I can't argue against someone else's personal experience, but, if you
are asking me to believe that the rather cheaply made Apple II would
perform nearly as long and reliably as an HP-86/87 (for example), when
making hundreds of thousands (millions?) of accesses to floppies over
a period of weeks or months, without a disk drive tuneup or alignment,
then I must be living in the wrong reality, i.e., everything performs
the same, regardless of its construction design.
SHOCK TIME:
I'm going to shock you now, by telling you that of all the HP computer
gear I have bought, the failure rate of new computers and major peripherals
was approximately 40%, within the initial one-year warranty period.
Actually, the failure rate within 90 days was well over 30%.  When I
wrote out the detailed list and sent it to corp. HQ, they must have
peed their pants, judging by the reaction I got.
Surprised?  So how do I justify this?  All I really know for sure, besides
what I've told you, is when the initial fixes are made, I can run heavy-
duty operations for many times longer without interruption than I possibly
could with most other brands.
Wanna know who the worst offenders are in consumer electronics, not only
when it comes to warranty-period failures, but failures soon after, due
to shoddy failure-proofing?  Sony and Toshiba.  I haven't had a lot of
Toshiba equipment, but the experiences I've had, and the attitude of the
company for not fixing them, are convincing for me (just my opinion).
I have had a *lot* of Sony stuff, mostly small (but fairly expensive)
items, and their product quality is abysmal, excepting large items
such as TVs, or a couple of small "professional" items such as the
Walkman D6C cassette recorder (Stereophile's favorite) and their pilot's
radios S??-70 and -80.

The logical implication here is that a thousand people "getting together"

that something.  Not a valid implication, although the result is not
necessarily false on a per-case basis.
Ironically, discrimination, prejudice, bigotry, hate, etc. are often

If you're saying that it's wrong (bad, whatever) for corporations to have
special protections and so on (taxes, other things) that don't apply to
individuals who are (for example) not part of any corporations, then I
do agree with you.
OTOH, the evils which can be accomplished in practice (never mind theory)
by power groups such as large corporations, which cannot be accomplished
by individuals (or cannot in practice be defended against) are a problem
that society has addressed, sometimes on a case-by-case basis (usually
better), and sometimes through big legislation, which often far outlives
its usefulness.  I hope we're at least seeing the same points.

is muddied by existing practice/legislation, i.e., the homeless are dis-

so much about the economic model as it does that the model is perturbed

Looking at positive issues, one could probably find as much interesting

Nothing inherently wrong with a GUI if:
1. It doesn't make it much more difficult to do operations which are
   inherently more efficient from a command line, -and-
2. It doesn't make the computer unacceptably buggy and/or slow, -and-
3. It doesn't make the existing software base unnecessarily obsolete...
The representative article on  is in Info World a few weeks ago, as
I recall.  There are a slew of useful DOS operations that are very
difficult (and some impossible) through the Win95 interface, but I'm
sure you already knew that.
I've been of the opinion that Win95 is more stable than Win3.x, since
it has its own memory management, but that assumes that any new software
for Win95 you load up isn't buggy...
On  I'm sure you are aware that there are plenty of people around who
have "power" in this PC industry, who would like to *remove* some of the
current user options from PC's in general, for instance, the DOS command
line.  Telling users "if you don't like it, buy something else" is
analogous to telling a person "if you don't like the way our government
and their team of lawyers is destroying your country, go somewhere else".
My utilities are a collection of Basic and 'C' code, somewhat modularized,
so that a new utility can be quickly pasted together from existing
routines, with minimal unique code (or as minimal as possible).
My knowledge of the underlying processes in these languages (on a PC,
anyway) is sufficient for me to be able to quickly analyze bottlenecks
and other areas of code where routines in assembler, etc. can be substi-
tuted for better performance or whatever.
This is very basic stuff for PC "experts", of course, but lots of folks
don't know and (tragically) don't care, particularly about the removal
of current user options from the systems.  When you operate a Mac, for
example, and you are used to not having certain options, you just don't
care, right?

Actually, there is not only good evidence for the environmental argument,
but you can reason it out yourself if you give attention to some things
that don't make it into most discussions on this topic.
Example:  Environment has a profound effect on a person's mind (outlook,
perceptions, attitudes, moods, etc.), and thereby has a significant, if
indirect effect on that person's hormone production (quantity, balance).
Those hormone productions have more effect on the body and brain long-
term than any other influence I can think of.
And believe it or not, in some (perhaps unusual) cases, unexpected
changes in hormone production can happen later in life as well, not
just during the "development" years. And I'm not talking about decreased
production either.

I have a very intelligent friend who loves jazz and has several thousand

kinda crazy...  I bought some 'trane albums in the 1960's.  My impression
was that they were very intellectual, or very technical, but not highly
musical (my opinion, and I love music).
BTW, the person who claimed that Jazz was the more significant contribution
of African-Americans in America is very short-sighted.
Jazz is just one expression of a highly intelligent and complex group
of people.  You should hear some of the gorgeous songs of South Africa
as sung by Miriam Makeba, for instance.  Also, rock-n-roll emerged from
blues, R&B, etc., and is profoundly dominant in Western culture over all

It is possible to understand intelligence as "pattern matching" skills,
without having to have attendant math and statistics to define it more
precisely or clinically. This understanding (if you have it) is the key
to knowing that Black persons do *not* have less IQ than White persons,
regardless of the standardized tests.  Something I know about, as I've
scored in the top 1/1000 of one percent, etc.
Nice that you have good intuition on this point, however, the big question
in your paragraph is not wherefore the genetic determinant, rather, it is
the understanding of intelligence in its overall context, which I dare say
most researchers in that field are probably ill-equipped to grasp.

There is *no* more real research that the research I do myself, and know
about myself:  1) I have generally tested in the top 1/000 of one percent
of the population in "intelligence", and  2) I have expended considerable
effort in personal study and experiments with what the human body is
capable of under given circumstances.  I have rubbed elbows with the
world's most well-conditioned people (physically), for one, and have
learned (for two) how to never get sick again (21 years running).
I hope I didn't give the wrong impression - genetics are certainly a
factor in anything human, however, environment has an overwhelming
influence on subsequent development. It's not 100% to 0%, in other words.
I hope I don't regret saying this, but the above study has a far greater
chance of being "politicized bullshit" than anything I'm likely to say,
even when it's not from my personal experience.  Get serious, Igor.
How the devil are you going to evaluate the fairness, honesty, and other
attributes of such a study?  Do you know the researchers?
If you were evaluating the integrity of a University study on the sexual
preferences of a Tsetse fly, there is a reasonable possibility of taint
in such an innocuous study, due to the grant money and how the outcome
data can leverage other monies, etc., but a study of Black -vs- White
IQ's?  I wouldn't read such a study unless I were stranded on a desert
island with nothing else to do.  I'd be better off reading something
more relevant to real life, such as the power struggles between the
ADL and Willis Carto, or Fred Goldman and O.J. Simpson, whatever.

I have not associated closely with any Black persons since 1981-1983, but
at that time, when I had worked with several such persons in Los Angeles,
in close quarters (me being the only White person), I was profoundly
impressed with the diversity and complexity of the issue (I was curious
about the issue due to my circumstances, although I certainly did not
mention it) in dealing with real people.  My experience tells me that
persons who administer intelligence tests and other related tests, or
persons who subscribe to study of such things, should get up close to
(for example) Black persons for an extended period of time, and I think
they (the White persons) would then seriously question any test results
which showed a consistent superiority for Whites.
I have recently (Oct. 1996) more-or-less inherited three half-Navajo
children, upon the death of their father (mother died 1993).  The kids
are 9, 11, and 13.  I have described to various people (schoolteachers,
parents, computer programmers, and so on) that raising kids of this age,
at this point in my life, is no more difficult than just living my own
life without them.  Getting past the emotional weaknesses that can
hobble you as a parent or guardian is paramount, and once you do that,
the rest is a cakewalk.  But what I really wanted to say was that my
experience with these children now (whom I didn't know until mid-1996)
has convinced me more than ever that intelligence is not only not
primarily genetic, but may also be recoverable to a large extent up to
the beginning of the teen years, if not beyond that.  I would guess that
children from most any background, young enough and lacking actual
physical brain damage or extremely severe psychological trauma, can
probably be brought up to the point where they can perform on an equal
level with the best our society has to offer.
The main and overwhelming factor in developing children who can accomplish
at a superior level is the personal attention of a caregiver, and what
that attention consists of.  There are some things you can read about
in a book and guess what they mean, and there are some things you can
know when you're staring them in the face...

Confucius say "To him that taketh offense, let him also take the gate".
(Sorry for the stupid pun, and I always assume the non-personal, but,
the subject begged for clarification.  I feel very limited in my
communication, given what I am thinking and trying to express it
clearly in English syntax.)
I would love to head up such a study, but with a difference: Instead of
doing purely passive research, which may have only an academic audience
(never minding the occasional Bell Curve etc. book), I would like to
impress my own training methods on the subjects, to see what their
physical and mental capacities really are (as far as my abilities
go, anyway), rather than simply watch.  It would be nearly impossible
(actually, probably impossible) in the USA to raise Black children and
totally isolate them from the mental awareness that a large segment of
the population has judgements about them having to do with their race.
Very sensitive people such as myself (and perhaps the Black children
under study as well?) know all too well the instant(!) impact that
such a realization and subsequent awareness has on a person's conscious-
ness (self-image, confidence et al), and how debilitating that awareness
can be in real life.  I don't think the studies reflect that. Then again,
to play Devil's Advocate for the studies, perhaps the studies just can't
be that broad in their scope, but, such a sensitive issue demands it.
There are so many factors, including (but not limited to) the unknown
agenda(s) of the senior persons in the money chain at the colleges,
think tanks, foundations, you get the picture.

Again, as a statistical exercise, this might be OK, but, quite a bit of
what you would see in the exceptional areas of the curve in childhood
would be rather obvious in adulthood as well. The fact that this doesn't
seem so obvious across the statistical curve is only evidence of poor
granularity in the data.
A typical researcher or team of same would not be proper candidates to
lead an interventionist study such as this.  You'd need people with
proven track records.  As I keep telling my wife again and again, when
we go into a book store and she picks up some book on a "health" topic:
What's the author's track record, not only for him/herself, but in
leading others?
It's just that in my personal experience, I've found that the vast
majority of children fall into the category of "exceptional potential".
I guess what I'm saying is that the accomplishment/test norms for most
children are far enough below where I could get them to with personal
attention, that  1) The norms are useful (to me) only as a stasticical
exercise, and  2) The differences between typical children and typical
children performing at or near their potential obscures the differences
found amongst the norms.
This is, I believe, what I and others feared from studies which provide
material for books such as the Bell Curve.  Knowing that the potential
of an allegedly unintelligent (or less-than-average) child might be so
great that that child (if lucky enough to get the opportunity) could
actually develop to be a significantly better performer than another
child with 40 more IQ points, even if the child with the higher IQ has
a reasonably good environment to develop in. Those kinds of possibilities
are (I think) near and dear to what some of our more enlightened founding
fathers in the USA had in mind when they wrote what they did, way back when.
I value the writings of all philosophers, BTW, but I reject the notions
of any that I or any other autonomous individual (a human is more-or-less
autonomous by definition, yes?) could be defined, limited, or otherwise
constrained by studies such as we've discussed.  I say constrained since
these studies do not happen in a vaccuum, and there is always going to be
some kind of fallout.

This experience on your part, of installing 100-plus Macs with only one
needing service, is beyond amazing.  Most computer people will readily
admit that HP (for example) is the best, reliability-wise, yet I have
purchased quite a few of their computers and major peripherals over the
past 20 years, and I have experienced an approximate 40% (!) defective
rate during the one-year warranty period, more than 30% falling within
the first three months.
As to why I still use their stuff - it's because the others are worse,
a fact which is almost universally agreed on.  How can this possibly
be, you ask?  Could it be really bad luck?  No. Could it be mishandling?
No.  For a reality check, another famed electronics vendor, Sony, has
the same problem, but even worse than HP.  Unfortunately, in the Sony
case, their products don't wear well after fixing, excepting a couple
of their rather expensive "professional" series products.
I suspect that the 100-plus Apple owners don't really use the machines,
otherwise, if they were so reliable, why does Apple desperately avoid
repairing their own products, when HP has provided top-level professional
technicians (not boys in dusty back rooms of cheap-ass computer stores)
to fix their products, and done so consistently ever since the beginning
of the PC business in 1966?

enough pressure on to satisfy the Times' agenda.
Further (and at the risk of being identified with a particular political
slant, which I don't have), this "newspaper" is actively collaborating
with other international interests to put the nail in Free Speech, via
the Holocaust issue.  Carto of Liberty Lobby fame (the bane of the ADL)
is down for the count again, and unlike the last two or three times, he
may not survive this one, probably because his supporters are thinning
out from old age. Carto's main theme in life, which I got in person one
day in 1993, is that the Holocaust has been co-opted by the National
Security State for a variety of reasons, one of which is to curtail
Free Speech (Holocaust deniers thrive on Free Speech), by passing laws
everywhere that make it a criminal offense to "doubt the Holocaust".
Again, my point isn't to argue any law, just to point out where change
in the law is going to come from.

There are times when you're a child (for some of them) that you can't

use their help (however intrusive), sometimes that's a whole lot better

After seeing the initial post, I ran out to get a copy, but they were

considered stego, even by a commercial publication such as Dr. Dobb's.
Can anyone confirm this?
I wrote an article for them in 1991 (after they printed my PC Computer
Manifesto), and at that time, the editor was really keen on filling in
some of the blanks left by the usual rushes to new compilers etc. that
leave everyone else ignored.
So they started sending me books to review.  After reviewing about six
books, all negatively (the books were crap), they didn't send any more
books, and wouldn't respond further.
I guess at the time their philosophy was something like "Yes, we live
in a world of crap, so, since we have to make a living with this crap,
let's deny that it's crap so we can continue to sell the stuff", etc.
Kinda like *certain* c-punks, who have nothing to say, so they blame
myself or Dr. Vulis for interfering with their degenerate doings on

My experience with several such magazines is that when a new editor

Critical thinking is hard enough, then having to research and document
your findings and get someone or someplace to distribute them, well,
it's too hard for most folks.
So most folks fall into these camps (or others perhaps):
Those who accept the conventional wisdom, i.e., Oswald did it, or,
Nurnberg was a real showdown, where the world got justice for the
Nazi atrocities.
Those who oppose the conventional wisdom with truly unsubstantiated
conspiracy theories:  Karen Silkwood was programmed to drive off the
road by a psychotronic computer located in Brussels which uses satellites
to send the beams of energy to the victims' brains.
Doing the hard work is not only hard, but depressing when nobody reads
it.  Probably a lot of people find the IHR (formerly Carto) publications
more interesting than the rather mindless crap put out by the ADL, to
name an example.
Telling people about the Holocaust ad nauseam here in 1996, which the
L.A. Times for instance does a lot, doesn't accomplish what I believe
is the stated objective, i.e., to prevent a reoccurence, not only against
Jews, but against all so-called undesirables.
Cypherpunks are not the only people who give plausible argument against
interference in places like Bosnia, but the fact that they do, and that
mass killings are still sanctioned for all sorts of erstwhile valid and/
or practical reasons, puts a serious challenge to the Holocaust promoters:
What exactly are you trying to do?
If Albert Einstein can promote the A-bomb to the President, knowing it
will kill hundreds of thousands of erstwhile innocent people at a single
burst, what is the point of continuing the propaganda?  To finance more
bombs so we can kill more Hitler supporters?  Sadaam was compared to
Hitler, but Ramsey Clark didn't buy it.  Lots of people who made lots
of money investing in Nazi Germany are still selling well in the U.S.

tossed a dollar into the cup, at which point the astonished Union soldier
exclaimed "thank you, sir".  The next week at the club, the same thing
happened, and the soldier asked "Excuse me sir, but why would a Southern
officer such as yourself be showing so much sympathy to a Union man like
myself?"  To which the Southern officer replied "Actually it's not that,

You talk about "standard" English in the U.S., as though the U.S. spoke
*true* English.  More bullshit.  Be that as it may, the principal agents
of the early United States (Presidents, etc.) were Virginians, hence
Southerners. Sure, the barbarian hordes followed from Europe and settled
into Northern manufacturing and so on, and from them you establish that
that represents "standard" English?
You would know, if you had read some of the suppressed history of the
U.S., that barbarians who "speak Northern" have propagated tremendous
amounts of disinformation, including setting up speaking exhibits of
U.S. Presidents, where even the Southern Presidents "speak Northern or
Midwestern", i.e. a ficticious history.

A true Civil War is two factions fighting for control of the same
government or taxable land area.  One could argue that the North and
South were both fighting for control of the South, but that would be
a specious argument.  If the South had intended in their declarations
of separation to free up the Northern states as well, then that would
add weight to the argument.
BTW, the fact that there were incursions into the North by the South
is no more evidence of Civil War than Chechens incursing into Moscow.

that the South started the War, having "attacked" Ft. Sumter (their own

Some of the postings here about people making a non-hire list because
of their speech "accent" is reminiscent of other forms of targeting.
I thought AP was more oriented toward selection based on behavior,
although in some people's poisoned minds, another person's speech
patterns/accents could be interpreted as behavior.
Don't you suppose that when some of the party-line-liberal (brainwashed)
persons (esp. from the Northeast or the Bay Area) hear a person speaking
in an authentic Southern "accent", that they often feel a twinge of fear,
as though someone from the KKK or whatever has just entered their immediate
surroundings?  I know that sounds kind of silly, but people do have those
knee-jerk reactions to certain visual and auditory clues, particularly
when they've been bombarded by big media with all those stereotypical
images over the years.

Dr. Vulis has in fact been forcibly unsubscribed.  He's on my "who
cypherpunks" list as of 12 Oct 1996, but does not appear as of
04 Nov, 30 Nov, and 18 Dec, when I last asked for a list.
The fact that he still reads the list and does posts only adds to the
arguments against censorship, specifically John Gilmore's censorship.
(This has got to be embarrassing for Gilmore, hee hee.  I'll bet he
practices keeping a straight face in front of a mirror, in case anyone
brings it up in person.)
If, as has been said, assassination is the ultimate form of censorship,
then Dr. Vulis has been shot, stoned, beat on, and cement-booted, but
he still lives and is a thorn (no pun intended) in the side of would-
be censors on the Internet.

It's been my experience in the L.A. area as well as elsewhere in the
U.S. that stores will take hundreds if the purchase is a significant
fraction of a $100 bill, or more than $100.  I've also found that
restaurants, for example, will nearly always take a $100 if the check
is over $20, and some will take it when the check is less than $20.
Common sense is the key, i.e., if the tab is $101, and you give them
two $100 bills, expecting $99 change, expect some static.
In spite of the brainwashed multitudes' attitudes about carrying cash,
and standing like beggars in an ATM line where muggers are prowling
nearby, the L.A. authorities actually urge(!) people to carry a few
hundred dollars at least in case of earthquake or other emergency.
Recently when I was in my bank drawing out some cash and getting change
(in a way that I suppose customers don't normally do), the teller made
a snide remark about my habits, so I raised my voice and said "Remember
the adage 'possession is 9/10 of the law?', well, when you possess my
money it's really your money, and I don't like that.  I'm withdrawing
my money, OK?"  That was the one and only time they made any remarks.

I subscribed to this list at the recommendation of someone else, and at
the time it was my first experience on the "new" Internet, i.e., browsers
and such (three years ago when I got on and off it was numeric menus only
as far as I know).  It's interesting to me how many ways there are to do
things, and how many ways there are to get around them.
For example, there must have been more than one way Gilmore could have
dealt with Dimitri (he chose the worst), and there must have been several
ways Dimitri could get around the ban (he chose a very easy methodology,
apparently, which sure makes me wonder what Gilmore was trying to do).
Hasn't been enforced?  Are you saying that Gilmore is trying to tell us:
"Hi, I'm John Gilmore. I'm cutting Dr. Vulis off the list, but actually,

This is really weird.  Maybe the person asking for SS cards is just

since 1965, shortly after it was issued.  I did three years in the U.S.

US numbers to only SS numbers circa 1967-1969), and nobody has ever
insisted I have one, although I've seen a reference maybe once every few
years about the need to have one.
Real-world humans lose cards all the time, hence the need to implant
people with ID chips as soon as the chips are secure enough to use as
guaranteed permanent and unique ID.  Not my first choice, of course.

Forget the law.  If you don't plea-bargain, you have to face the jury.
What's the jury gonna do?  Depends on a mixture of their own knowledge
and feelings, and whatever instructions the judge gives them.
1. Your state of mind re: defending yourself will influence the jury.
2. The judge's instruction as to necessary force will influence them.
   (Understand that your situation is not the same as a police officer)
3. The jury's decision about whether your actions were appropriate,
   based on what they think your options or rights were.
Juries do not, in my memory, let people off the hook when they shoot
a person who is suspected, say, of raping their child, as the woman
did in (the Bay area?) a couple years ago.
OTOH, juries do sometimes allow pretty amazing extenuations.  The case
in Meigs County Tenn. circa 1986-87, when the man in the bar was being
harrassed by acquaintances - he went out to his truck, got some guns,
and came back in and blasted two or three guys.  He got off clean.

The above is a nice ideal.  You should of course get a "really good" consultant,

most of all, or at the very least, require the most research to find.
The ideal of capping the cost is commendable as well, however, when the consultant
finds midway through the project that his initial estimate (made as carefully as he
possibly can) is way too low, he will now have an incentive to lie, cut corners, etc.,
*particularly* if the customer looks like one of those antsy types who might withhold

Since this is such a perfect example of making unfair judgements about other people's

There is nothing wrong with having a life expectancy of 35, if you grow up in a society
where the normal lifespan is 35.  To say that it's "bad", and that we "simply must"
dispense our technology upon "them" is bogus.  Sure, most techno-freaks would leap at
the chance to expand their own lifespans to, say, 200+ years (with good health), and
acquire nifty advanced techno devices as well should some unforseen advanced race or
species dispense that stuff on us.

When Reagan and his financiers descended on China in 1985, they commenced a deal that

Some (not all) economic theories are quite simple, like the physics of flowing water or

In the U.S., for example, you have the world's most highly disciplined and aggressive
consumers, and in China, for example, you are seeing what is becoming the world's

Personal and business references that you can check out are a good start, but beware
of expecting much from org's such as BBB, etc.  The reasons are twofold:
1. Most org's today are (despite the fact that they have computers on their desks)
   extremely shy about picking sides in computer software business matters, because,
2. Unlike nearly any other business, software development/implementation is not
   predictable in many situations like house or bridge building.  Costs and hours
   may run many times what was estimated, unless the up-front estimate was so
   exhaustive (paid for, huh?) that it could be relied on as usably accurate.
   The fact is, the more cookie-cutter the project is, the more likely it will meet
   estimates.  Unfortunately, most customers don't want cookie-cutter for a number
   of reasons, one being the reluctance to pay for old (tried and true) technology.
Another qualified OK - you may be able to identify the weasels all right, but if you
expect the "good guys" to absorb all cost overruns for way-inaccurate estimates, well,
maybe they will on the phase of the project that they have a solid committment to,
but then they'll still leave you with a dead end product if it costs them way too much,
and they'll do it legally, and they won't need you as a reference anyway, since they
will have other satisfied customers.  And with all this, it still comes down to the
fact that a comprehensive, thorough, and accurate estimate on a significant computer
project is either impossible, or it'll cost way more than a customer will want to
pay for.  You already know if you've been to court that telling the "honest truth"
will not get you the best result many times, so it shouldn't surprise anyone that
these kinds of projects would not bring out the most honest side of people.

next thing to be enacted to further tighten the screws on the "Doctor", and add more
limits to freedom?

Isn't this the same argument used by the state whenever they want to differentiate
between your "rights" and your "privileges"?  Can they reject one of your privileges
whenever they want to, at their discretion?  No.
So if c-punks is really "private", how does it decide (arbitrarily?) who to include
and who to reject?
Note that I'm not saying that it's absolutely wrong to reject anyone, at any time
necessarily, I just don't think your last sentence about a *private* list was well

I've been looking up some of the words tossed around in this thread, in a dictionary
and elsewhere, to see if I can understand you.  It still sounds to me as though you
believe totally in authoritarian systems.  I don't consider myself a Socialist, but
I believe that some of the well=known concepts of ownership (the U.S. Constitution
has some of these) have both a popular meaning and a hidden meaning.
Question:  When you say *owner*, does this mean he runs the list on his own personal
computers, at his home, or at his business which he owns himself, or could it
mean that he's functioning on behalf of an educational institution and the term
*owner* has a different meaning than what most people would assume?
Maybe I shouldn't ask this kind of question, out of fear or something like that.

A more practical and realistic example might be if Dale was living in an apartment,
and Dale's mother walked out to the garage to get into her car, and the next-door
neighbor started calling her the most vile and foul things (but no direct threats
of harm or whatever), and Dale called the Police, and the Police said "there's
absolutely nothing we can do, and further, if you should happen to get into a
scuffle with the neighbor defending your poor old mother, even if the neighbor
starts the fight, we will arrest you and take you to jail", ad nauseam.
When asked directly what the male police officers would do if someone tried that on
their mother or wife, they would be evasive and non-committal, because, as you see,
they have to defend themselves first before they can defend you, the paying client.
This is far more realistic than your example, since the immediate neighborhoods where
these situations develop are a better model for cypherpunks than the inside of one
individual's home.  Other models I can think of might be a free-speech forum such as
a radio talk show, with rather strict guidelines due to the FCC or the host station,
or (less likely) a continuous, never-ending party hosted at an individual's home,
where that individual can exercise total autocracy in throwing someone out.
I could probably do better with this, or even leave it alone, if the arguments were
more rational and less of "I feel this is wrong....it just feels wrong", etc.

My computer and my access to cypherpunks is not inside of anyone's home.  One could
argue that all speech originates and/or is controlled anywhere, which is not the
point here.  Here, John has opened up whatever computer hardware for an essentially
public forum (I could detail the process of subscribing for you in intimate detail
and with all of its shades of meaning to demonstrate that it is perceived by a very
large segment of the subscribers as public), and has taken action to oust someone.
Now, don't you think it odd that if people really perceived this forum to be "really
private", that they would so strongly object to this ousting, particularly of the
person in question, who is not even liked by these objectors?
You can argue until doomsday the "privacy of home" issue, but I'd suggest to you that
a possible way to settle this in the minds of that large segment of participants who
disagree with you would be for John to make it more visibly clear on this forum that
the forum is his private child, and he can do whatever he darn well pleases with it.
Of course, what you're suggesting (subtly) is that one of the things John can darn
well do is keep silent, and continue to do as he pleases, which makes me wonder

A vastly more accurate analogy is that the "Doctor" is not in fact inside of the bar,
as none of the cypherpunks are inside of anyone's home but their own.  Vulis is some-
where else, sending his brand of beer to the bar in competition with a number of
other "vendors".  Customers and vendors alike complain that Vulis' bottles have
offensive portraits on them, possibly famous sports figures in an unflattering light.
So the bar owner bans Vulis' beer, but he sends it in anyway through a third party,
and several patrons discover that they can easily remove the outer label from the
bottle and see the original portraits.
There are similarities to Prohibition here.
Now the bar owner, being the owner, can throw out anyone he wants to anytime, and he
gets away with this with little or no trouble lawsuit-wise, since the courts are much
more lenient with owners of bars and rock-n-roll venues that with, say, Denny's
As I've said before, all forums on the net can be arranged at some point in the future
to be "privately" owned, and the question is, can there be a free speech forum where

My first comment on the subject:  It's only irreversible if certain conditions hold.
First, if the masses become dependent on a large software program which has to be

which is controlled by those who benefit from said control (not the masses), then
those who "compile their own" would tend to stand out and be more noticeable.
Second, any truly secret messaging taking place represents a serious threat to the
military, and contrary to some naive popular opinion, those guys are not going to
lay down for this, unless it happens on an immense scale, i.e., the *majority* of

So how do you get a fair trial on a controversial issue?  I'm asking this seriously.
In the O.J. case, if the "evidence" followed standards and weren't tainted, and they
didn't have a racist psycho like Fuhrman all over the case, and neo-Nazis over at
Cedars-Sinai collecting O.J.'s blood, then we wouldn't have so much controversy.
But the "mass majority" decided he was guilty anyway, damn the evidence or how it was
collected, or what that could mean if you or I were framed, so, take a look around at
cypherpunks, and how they disagree widely on issues, and ask yourself how you could
get a fair trial from a cypherpunks jury.
But the jury system is still *much* better than judges only, as long as the jury isn't
stacked.  For example, the new O.J. jury is nearly all white, and since that particular
venue requires only a majority (not unanimous) decision, the jury is defacto all white,
which is tantamount to a lynching.

This is a misleading challenge.  There's a helluva difference between the OTP and a
Public Key system.  If, for example, it can be proven that I can crank up PGP to its
most cryptic level, and send the OTP overseas with "absolute security", so that I
can now send messages with the OTP which was crunched with PGP's highest security,
then that would mean something.
Just so there's no misunderstanding:
1. The OTP is absolutely unbreakable. (if done correctly)
2. The OTP encryption cannot be decoded on the other end unless you can deliver the
   OTP to the person on the other end by a secure means.
3. PGP, which is not usually used at its highest level of security (for all bits in
   a message), *will* be used at its highest level of security to send the OTP to the
   person on the other end.
4. The OTP arrives on the other end, completely safe from snooping.
Now you see the problem.   above can't be assured, and that is why Ed says that PGP
is not shut off "right now", because it's probably not "really secure".
I'm amused to think that, in a nation armed with 20,000 or so nukes, the paranoid of
paranoid nation-states as it were, some of the erstwhile intelligent citizens think
that the U.S. military are just sitting around wringing their hands over the "fact"
that the citizens have "unbreakable" crypto.
Bear in mind the Scientific American articles on Public Key crypto back in the 1970's.
The military knew the score back then, and if you think they just sat back and allowed

My main point, which is really difficult to make, since software issues
are so complex today, is that I've been involved with projects on a
similar scale as PGP, where several programmers contributed code to a
particular executable program, and when this is the case (especially
where the source is not obvious as would be data entry code and the like),
it's just not practical for one person working alone, unpaid, to break
the source down into manageable chunks and study it and make enough notes
so that every portion of it is clearly understood and validated.
People in the past have discussed 50 million line Fortran programs to set
up jet training simulators and so forth, and by comparison a 60,000 line
source in 'C' might look doable, as far as complete annotation is concerned.
To illustrate the point, then, I recently had a chance to estimate the cost
of converting a non-'C' program to 'C', which would result in a 'C' program
of about 6,000 lines, or about 1/10 the size of PGP.  My best guess was
about 500 to 1,000 hours, and to analogize that to PGP, where I wouldn't be
writing or converting code ostensibly, just annotating it, I would still
guess 2,500 to 5,000 hours, if the job were done correctly and thoroughly.
If the job is not practical/feasible, then IMO I can say it's not doable.
OTOH, if some one or a handful of people wanted to make the source code
of PGP really accessible to the masses (of programmers at least), they
should start with a plan to make sure it's broken down into a heirarchy
of functions so that:
1. No one function is too large (say, no more than 50 lines or so).
2. All functions use reasonably short variable names (ex: 'iTrapon').
3. Variable names are consistent in capitalization.
4. Function names follow the heirarchy and are logically intuitive.
5. Constant and  names follow a heirarchy as well.
6. Where a choice is possible between setting out a construct that
   (visually speaking) looks very complex and is difficult to follow,
   and making it simpler, take the simpler path.

@_subject: Apology to Dale Thorn 
I've made errors attributing stuff to wrong parties (oops, cringe).
And I apologize for not offering a viable alternative to PGP.
In another posting, I made a suggestion for making the source code to
PGP *really* public, i.e., in a form that the average programmer can
verify and edit (for personal use only, of course).
I'm tending to think that, instead of using PGP for all encoding (even
though it may have multiple facilities for all situations), a message
could be encrypted with a good trusted private-key system or whatever,
then the private key encrypted with the Public Key software and sent
either separately or with the message.
The above might be more cumbersome, but it could be automated with
messaging automation techniques. At least it would reduce the dependence
on PGP to encrypting only the private key(s), which would encourage using
PGP at its most secure (slowest) level of encryption for the entire process
of encrypting the private key data.  As an aside to OTP's, this would not
apply for obvious reasons, i.e., the length of the key.
Of course, this still requires validation of PGP in whatever portion of
the code would be required to encode the private key.  My recommendation
for really serious users would be to separate out that code and recompile
it separately from the remainder of PGP (for personal use only, of course).
And in case it got lost in my rhetoric, I do appreciate that there's no
substitute for the Public Key process.

not do some bit dumps into an ASCII file that contains just "1"'s and
"0"'s, and then view the file by holding down the down-arrow or page-
down key (assuming a fast enough cursor speed)?
The file would look something like this:  10101110000010101101000101101
but would fill the entire screen, and by scrolling through it, it seems
you would notice any obvious bit patterns.
Just a thought....

@_subject: Legal Deffinition of Encryption? 
Do you assume that all useful algorithms are patented or copyrighted?
Would you further assume that executable encryption programs would have
to be resident on some particular media long enough (say, 30 seconds to
a few minutes) that agents who have just broken the door in will be able
to preserve either the source code or the executable code and take it
with them as evidence?
I know that the FDA cracks down on what it terms "dangerous substances"
and "practicing (something or other) without an appropriate license",
but the folks it crashes in on are generally distributing herbs, vitamins,
and other goodies which wind up inside of people's bodies, so there is
a measure of legitimacy to their protections, if not to their methods.
Protecting people from ideas and algorithms which go into their minds is
feasible only when the ideas are complex enough and require sufficient
physical manipulations (designing and building a fusion bomb, for example)
as to make the implementor of such things quite noticeable.
So the only possible Public Key encryption has all been designed and
patented, and there's no other algorithms that can be brought forth,
let's say, by someone who doesn't want a patent, but merely wants to
put the idea out into the public domain?
I suppose if some angel were to float out a new Public-key algorithm onto
the Net, then there would automatically be an anti-angel (from the NSA?)
who would show that it was in fact patented, and had to be withdrawn?
My guess is, if they tried this too many times through legal channels,
in spite of all manner of legislation, there would be a backlash of
sufficient proportion to render their efforts less than useful.

I hope I'm not repeating this in more than one or two places, but the
idea originated as a way to verify PGP code, i.e., if one could verify
some minimal portion of it sufficient to send a small message (i.e., a
private key), one could then rely on his/her own favorite (and really
well verified) private key software to do the bulk of the encryption.
Relying on one software program (despite the hoopla) to "do it all" is,
in my book, a prescription for disaster.  The peer-review statements
notwithstanding, the PGP source code, at 60,000 or so lines, and without
a doubt way too complex for one individual and his/her closest trusted
associates to verify, cannot be trusted without a really clean rewrite,
using a heirarchical design of some sort, where all code is completely
consistent and well-annotated, broken into numerous small functions,
and is very easy to read and follow.
If you think the above can't be justified, as in the example that PGP
will have to be continuously updated in its central routines, so as to
maintain its "edge" in security, well, that would imply that its security
is seriously lacking if attacked by advanced hackers.
I know it may not be a perfect analogy, but remember the HSCA board review
from the late 1970's regarding certain forensics in the JFK case?  If I'm
not mistaken, the central points demonstrating conspiracy were upheld by
only one professional out of approximately 12, i.e., Cyril Wecht.
Now you're not going to convince any jury I know of that Oswald did it,
or did it alone, but getting past that and to the professionals who did
the reviews of certain evidence, it should be obvious that in cases where
there may be *very important* programs for which the public needs to be
convinced of this-or-that, the government-controlled institutions (i.e.,
the major universities) can come up with all the experts it needs to
convince people of this-or-that.  Some of these I know personally...

As a war, not genocide per se, but you could include as many as 100 million
Africans killed in the slave trade, as long as the U.S. Park Police don't
get dibs on verifying the official count.  You might also include a large
number of Chinese "laborers" in the 1800's.
When I was in school in the 1950's and 1960's, the schools said there were
no more than 3 million N.A.'s here circa 1600 or so.  The official count
remains controversial.  BTW, since Columbus, the Conquistadores, et al
gutted much of Central and South America, include them too.
I wouldn't even bother with these two. The numbers are not that reliable,
the topic is still way too hot for open research even today, and besides,
all sides killed probably 100 million or better in WW2, most of them from
purely terrorist bombing.  The significance of the "Holocaust" should
not have been co-opted for commercial purposes as it has, but as they
say, wishing don't make it so.
30 million is the "low" count, probably includes "hard" purges and
identifiable political prisoners and very close associates, and perhaps
some family members.  Total unjustifiable non-war homicides on the part
of the Stalin government (while Stalin in charge) may be 65 million or
Similar comments as above - unjustifiable homicides on the behest of the

after the founding of the FBI by Napoleon's grandson.
Word is that while the World Jewish Congress declared war on Hitler in
1933, the ADL actually *suppressed* Jewish dissent in the U.S., at least
until 1937-38, because it was "good for business". I wouldn't call these
ADL people "Jewish", I'd call them pals of Prescott Bush and Averell
Harriman, to name a couple of supreme scumbags.  The same people and
ideology who propped up Hitler are foaming at the mouth now over their

Neither "aga", nor myself, nor anyone else I know has suggested what you

The fact is, the list does run, and you'd have a hard time convincing me

*more* capital and doing *more* support if he hadn't cut the "Doctor" off

What myself and others would like to see (and we're willing to argue for
such a thing as much as is humanly possible) is a non-hypocritical list,
where a person is not banned for the content of their speech as Vulis was.
People who agree with you drone on ad nauseam about Vulis' "actions",
another denial technique IMO. What Vulis *did* was speech, not "actions".
Frankly, I would much rather read his postings than the anti-speech drivel
that's been posted so much here lately.
I'm guessing John must be thinking one of a couple things:
1. Like a home property in Beverly Hills, where all the lawns are neatly
   trimmed, and everyone behaves so properly, John looks at "his" list one
   day and freaks out, saying to himself something like "gadzooks, Vulis
   is trashing my list, as though he moved in next door and lowered the
   value of "my property".
   And don't get me wrong, I understand the feeling, it's just that when
   you've decided you have a "right" to control something like cypherpunks,
   all you're really going to accomplish is to lessen your own reputation,
   because you can't control cypherpunks like you can property in B.Hills.
   If you like the Beverly Hills analogy, try to come up with a scenario
   where (as in Beverly Hills) you can get the cooperation and approval of
   85% - 95% of the residents (subscribers) to boot out the undesirables.
2. John may have become concerned about his possible liability for some
   of the postings (accusations of child molesting, etc.), and panicked
   and did the knee-jerk damage control he thought best.
   Now, under ordinary circumstances, a list "owner" or operator may not
   be responsible for any of the traffic content, as long as it can be
   demonstrated that they "weren't aware" of any libelous content. In the
   case of cypherpunks, though, Gilmore could scarcely deny knowing about
   some of this stuff.  **This is mere conjecture on my part**.

Point 1: HP (if you follow their history) would love to do something
exactly like this.  Microsloth and several hardware vendors (including
HP) are currently working on handheld computers which run a subset of
Win95 (called Pegasus), which are due out this year.  If this project
flies, they'll surely graduate it to laptops, to portable phones and
pagers, etc. etc.  Building a certain amount of the O/S into ROM has
its advantages....
Point 2: I've said something like this before, but here's a place where
it could mean something.  If c-punks and others could divvy up as many
of the supporting functions of "strong" crypto as possible, and issue
them in a set of commonly-available libraries for any and all programmers,
along with source code, then an application programmer (theoretically)
could order up some of these libraries and write some useful crypto code
in short order.  This would be much better than taking on thousands of
lines of source code directly.  This would also allow several vendors to
issue similar libraries, and surely someone on the Net could arrange
for comparitive product reviews.
This way, once you have a product up and running, if you (for example)
would like to replace the XYZ function with something a little better,
without impacting the rest of the code, you could order a replacement
for that function and plug it in, perhaps with no code modifications.

I'm jealous.  And I'm not kidding.  The NY Times costs $1.50 or $2.00 for
a daily in L.A., and considering the La-La Times is $0.25, paying 6 times
as much for the NY paper seems almost reasonable.
Out here in Disney Hell, we have 2 (count 'em) papers for 12 million or
so people in the L.A. basin, the O.C. Register (same as L.A. Times, but
reflavored for the suburban white folk in Orange County), and of course,
the (barf) L.A. Times itself.
A few years ago, the L.A. Weekly (free) enjoyed both an immense distribution
and a pretty good reputation.  Gone.  Long gone.  There's a much smaller
free weekly in O.C. (of all places) that has much of the credibility that
the L.A. Weekly gave up, but sadly, very limited distribution.
But I'm sure that goes to all levels in comparing NY and L.A.  If you
wanna collect a good stack of independent reading material in NY, I'll
bet you don't have to drive through 100 miles of hell to get the stuff.
So far NY has been pretty well insulated from what goes on here, and I
suppose that's because anyone who values such things as intellectual
freedom would prefer to live there as opposed to La-La land.  But if
you're saying it can't happen there, or that things really are getting
better, no.
Media consolidation is a public fact, it's been all over the financial
pages for some time now.  Have you not heard (just to name a couple of
examples) of the big weapons manufacturers like GE and Westinghouse
buying up NBC, CBS, etc.  Most Americans, you should know, get their

The biggest influence on IQ are the so-called "engrams" (fears, super-
stitions, anxieties, etc.) planted in your brain early in life.
Some of this can be overcome with mental exercise, and awareness of what
negative influences are holding you back.  Much easier said than done!
IQ as they attempt to measure it can probably be most easily explained
as pattern matching skills. Unfortunately for testing, and although you
can be every bit as intelligent at 70 as at 10, your pattern-matching
skills change and evolve over time, so any given tests will only apply
(more or less) at the age group they are optimized for.

The danger in conspiracy theories (and you can check the L.A. Times for

The fact is, though, that only government possesses the power to ruin the

As far as the difficulty in creating the infrastructure to monitor every-

is listen in, and have smart programs to sort out what they want to look

Not at all, and I think you could make some interesting equations out of

Factors for raw intelligence, i.e., pattern matching skills.
Factors for aggressiveness, assertiveness, self-confidence, etc.
Factors for manipulative ability (to manipulate people, etc.).  I don't
know how to properly categorize this last item, but perhaps a professional
psychologist would.
In sum, I think you could observe successful people and establish most
of the relevant factors, but be aware - if you are not an insider in
several of these "success circles", you might miss one or more key
factors, particularly those that would be denied by successful people,
such as willingness to do things people don't like to talk about openly.

Sorry for the extra mail, but I couldn't resist.  At age 12, in a family
of 7, my father lost his salaried job at Goodyear corporate HQ, and we
went on welfare for awhile.  I can tell you for a fact that both then and
now, welfare is worth *more* than $10/hour, if you have a family.
We not only got lots of food free from the govt. food warehouse, but they
took care of the other annoyances to some extent.  Some help was county
welfare, some federal.  Then, when my father didn't go back to the gravy
job, my mother got a good job with (you guessed it) the county welfare
dept., got a good supervisor position, and has retired with a nice pension.
Today I'm a well-paid computer programmer, and yet once again I'm on the
receiving end of welfare benefits (you would not believe how many there
are) in a round-about way, which I can't explain for obvious reasons.
Problem is, even though I can see billions going to people who don't need
the money, I can't think of a solution that could be evaluated as *fair*
by the people who pay for the system.  To suggest that we could support
people only when they *really* need the help would be to suggest what,
bread lines, maybe, instead of a check in the mailbox every so often?

The above comments, and the snipped comments about "a few more Wacos will
wake the people up etc.", assume that the govt. hasn't learned anything
about the politics of mass surveillance over the past few decades.
In fact, they've learned a lot.  The surveillance can be kept completely
quiet, and when they need to take someone out, they can do that very
quietly as well.  And not a whole lot of people will be angry, because
they'll crank up the reputation destructo-machine/P.R. press to preclude
any problems there.
Waco was an aberration, because key people were hiding behind a quantity
of other non-key people, and the FBI blundered in and grandstanded to the
point of creating a Kent State kind of scene.  To suggest that future
Waco's are necessary to take out troublemakers is shortsighted.

Just in case someone replies saying "It's not all that bad", or "It can't
happen here", etc., you should know this:
The United States government has not been responsive to the people for
a long time, but what's become evident in recent years is that they're
also no longer responsive to basic law and order.
They do respond to extreme pressure, as was applied in the Weaver, Waco,
and other similar cases, but, as a general rule, they do whatever they
want all the way to the top of the Justice dept. with impunity.
Example:  George Bush's old pal at the Wash. DC P.R. firm hires the
niece(?) of a Kuwaiti official to testify in front of Congress in full
view of the American people on television, that the Iraquis were throwing
babies out of incubators in Kuwait, thereby securing the necessary votes
in Congress to prosecute the Gulf War.
When it was discovered (after the "war") that the Incubator Baby Scandal
was a lie, nobody was prosecuted.  Further, in blatant violation of the
U.S. Constitution, Bush and Schwartzkopf were knighted by Queen Elizabeth
II of England.
There are also numerous examples of the Justice dept. being caught red-
handed forging documents to frame people for whom they had no evidence or
insufficient evidence to prosecute, and what happens in those cases?

Re: Below text.  One of the most fascinating aspects of the Simpson case
(to me, anyway) is how persons who know about conspiracies, mafia hits,
etc., are still willing to believe OJ is guilty (fer sure), looking only
at the "evidence" presented by the same folks who (send for list).
I spent many days at the house, talked to a lot of people, read a lot of
material, in short, I researched the case, and here's what I found:
Remember the pictures of Nicole that got so much coverage?  Edited on a
computer by National Enquirer, as they have done on so many other jobs.
Interesting that Enquirer used the same company which "verified" the
Oswald photos for the Bruno Magli shoe photos of OJ.  This company's
main business is propaganda and disinformation for govt. agencies.
Funny OJ would wear sneakers to McDonalds, change to Brunos for the hit,
then change again after showering.  Work clothes and dress shoes, hmmm.
Is Simpson an abuser?  Get a video of Joel Steinberg's wife's testimony;
see an abused person, for real.
Challenge: Find one instance in OJ's life where he hit someone (for
real), and caused:  1) a broken bone, dislodged or chipped tooth.
                    2) a cut requiring at least one stitch.
                    3) any other real injury.
The point is *not* that OJ didn't inflict mental cruelty and a certain
level of "yuppie violence", but don't insult me with the notion that OJ
somehow compares to real domestically-violent men, some of whom I know.
The idea that the police found a few drops of Simpson's blood in the
middle of two gallons (500,000 drops?) of victim blood is about as
likely as "Oswald" shooting Tippit with a revolver and leaving empty
cartridges at the scene, near the body.  And remember, "Oswald" left a
plethora of other "evidence", too.
So where would they get OJ's blood?  Try Cedars-Sinai.  OJ left blood
there more than once, and plenty of it.
Did you know that Al Cowlings (drove the bronco) was a/the driver for
alleged mobster Joey Ippolito?  Joey disappeared just before the hit on
Ron and Nicole.  OJ's alleged coke partner from Buffalo was iced with a
couple of girls days after.  Denise Brown (battered women foundation)
sits in open court with her date Tony "The Animal" Fiato, another
mobster on the Witness Protection program.  Ron's psychiatrist's office
is broken into a la Daniel Ellsberg, and Ron's file is stolen.
Do you see anything fishy about any of this?  I, like many other people, was glued to the TV when they led "Oswald" out to the car.  I saw Ruby do the hit.  If you've seen one Untouchables (circa 1959) melodrama, you've seen them all, and with Ruby, the glove did indeed fit.  Please don't be another sucker for the govt. on this one.

FAQ for Cryptography Of A Sort (COAS)
Author  : Dale Thorn Revised : 29 Sep 1996
[Source code and documentation follow this FAQ]
Q: Is COAS an actual product?
A: COAS is an encryption engine supplied in source-code format, which
   calls some commonly-available (and replaceable) functions included
   with commercial computer-language libraries, which in turn perform
   some of the rudimentary tasks required by the program.  Public Key
   features are not currently supported in COAS, therefore, messaging
   applications are not as well supported as is local file encryption.
Q: What are the main differences between COAS and other non-messaging-oriented
   crypto products?
A: 1. COAS repositions bits based on multiple encoding passes using one or more
      Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNG's).  Since COAS is provided only in
      source code format, and since the source code calls the PRNG function in
      the compiler library(s), COAS is actually independent of specific PRNG's.
      NOTE: PRNG limitations, as described in the popular literature, do not
            necessarily apply when repositioning bits in multiple passes, as
            opposed to modifying bits as is normally done in other software.
            Think of "brute force encryption" (more on this below).
   2. COAS does not use a "key" as such, and thus does not "encrypt" the bits
      in a text bitstream.  Instead, it uses an input value (text or numeric)
      as an entry point into a common PRN sequence.  Since the entry point is
      a secret, and since bits are moved using random block sizes, from their
      original bytes into unrelated destination bytes, cryptanalytic attempts
      must necessarily begin with brute-force guessing as to the entry points
      in the PRN sequences, in order to associate the correct bits with their
      original bytes of text.  Multiple encoding passes raise the number of
      guesses exponentially.
   3. COAS source code is extremely small, the primary intent for which was
      to provide a sample encoding engine for local/personal computer files.
      Due to its small size and simplicity, the source code can be easily
      modified by casual users, who may add in their own custom routines.
      NOTE: It cannot be overemphasized, that crypto programs which have
            a widely-respected reputation must also be held suspect when
            A) The very nature of those programs is to deceive, -and-
            B) The source code is either not available, or is so complex
               as to discourage ordinary people from working with it.
Q: But if COAS uses a common, ordinary PRNG, how can it possibly be secure?
A: I can think of two arguments against using PRNG's:
   1. Encoded text is easy to decode by brute force on most computers, -and-
   2. Encoded text can be seen as having regular patterns when "viewed" from
      the vantage point of programs employing higher-dimensional mathematics.
   Addressing the former, a single-pass encryption of a text file using the
   typical PRNG might be breakable in as little as .000001 second on one of
   the larger, faster computers available, however, the same approach might
   require as many as 10^24 years if the number of encoding passes reaches
   ten or more.  To simplify: try to guess the number I'm thinking between
   zero and 32,000.  You can make 16 billion guesses per second, so it will
   take only .000001 second (on average) to get the correct answer.  If you
   had to guess ten numbers correctly (and sequentially), it would require
   roughly (16,000^10) / 16,000,000,000 seconds, approximately 10^24 years.
   Addressing the latter, the ability to "view" the text as a lattice in a
   higher dimension is likewise diminished by the discontinuities inherent
   in multi-pass encoding, when bit-group sizes are determined dynamically
   by PRN's following the secret entry points into the PRNG sequences.
Q: What about the possibility that two or more encryption passes could be
   decrypted in a single pass, as in the scenario where a third key K3 is
   functionally equivalent to two separate encrypting keys K1 and K2?
A: Since COAS encoding is controlled through entry points into a PRNG's
   number sequences (adjacent encryptions may also use different PRNG's
   and/or bit-move logic), searching for a "key" or algorithm which can
   unpack two or more layers of coding will prove futile when all entry
   points into the PRNG's are different, and different PRNG's are used.
   A couple of points to consider:
   One, the output of the PRNG (or any number series) does not describe
   the bit move-to locations; those are determined by sorting the PRN's
   then moving the bits according to the sequence of the original array
   positions of the PRN's prior to sorting. Since some of the PRN's are
   duplicates, the original array positions relative to each other will
   be determined by chance, i.e., the vagaries of the sort process, etc.
   Two, since the bits are moved rather than modified, and since groups
   of bits vary in size, an attempt to find particular bits that belong
   to specific bytes after multi-move shuffling, using any compound key
   or algorithm in a single decoding pass, will certainly prove futile.
Q: Since the personal computer implementation of COAS uses 16-bit integers to
   initialize (set entry points into) the PRNG's, would ten encryption passes
   be somehow equivalent to the use of a 160-bit key in conventional programs?
A: If the conventional program used a 160-bit key in a manner similar to COAS,
   it would still have to:  1) move bits, not change them. 2) use an indirect
   method for specifying move locations.  3) model the processes used in COAS
   quite closely, since there's no straightforward mathematical approach that
   can duplicate the conditions described in the previous question and answer.
Q: What's the difference between the techniques used by COAS and the use of a
   One-Time Pad (OTP)?
A: The theory behind the OTP assumes that (unlike the use of a Public/Private
   key) subsequent encryptions using the same OTP key would reveal the nature
   of the OTP, i.e., any newly-encoded files and messages would share certain
   common identifiable characteristics which could be exploited to facilitate
   the decryption of all files using that pad.
   COAS, on the other hand, doesn't alter any of a file's bits, and therefore
   does not "add" its PRNG entry points' characteristics to a file other than
   shuffling bits in accordance with the original physical positions of PRN's
   which have been sorted by size.
Q: Is it possible for anyone to alter the contents of files encrypted by COAS
   so that a person performing the eventual decryption would not realize that
   the file(s) were indeed altered?
A: Less likely than incidental or brute-force decryption.  Each bit is moved
   once in each encryption pass, and if any bits were moved or changed, that
   many bytes (or nearly as many, since bits are not moved in byte-divisible
   groups, so most will end up in unrelated bytes after encryption) would be
   affected, and the resulting bytes would not likely pass even the simplest
   checksum test.
Q: Is COAS a "weak" product (cryptographically speaking), either because of
   limitations in its own internal algorithms, or in the commercial library
   functions it calls?
A: COAS can be used in ways that produce weak encryption, which is really
   an advantage in encouraging beginners to get started, given its simple
   user interface. Whether it can produce "strong" encryption or not is a
   matter of opinion, where said opinion is not so much a function of the
   product's alleged weaknesses, as it is the fact that cryptography grew
   up from a long history of hand-ciphering and the mathematics attending
   that growth, and the obvious resistance to new paradigms in this field.
   While mathematical proof of encryption strength is highly desirable in
   most applications (some would argue essential in certain applications),
   I see things this way:  Computer software of any kind, which cannot be
   analyzed by common persons (average programmers), whose innards cannot
   be exposed to the masses for whatever reason, should not be used where
   it could effect control over the lives of those people.  Looking at it
   a different way, it's wise for any individual or group to evaluate the
   software that's available, and make their own judgements independently
   of "expert opinion" in the field.

New  CCRP  documentation - changes as of 28.02.1996
----------Command----------    ------------------Output-------------------
CCRP                           Usage parameters.
CCRP  filename  /e             Encrypt each byte in 'filename' so that the
                               data cannot be seen, or, if the file was an
                               executable file, it cannot be executed.
CCRP  filename  /d             Decrypt (restore) each byte in 'filename'.
CCRP  filename  /e  key        Encrypt or decrypt 'filename', but add an
CCRP  filename  /d  key        additional factor (a key, or a password)
                               to the encryption and decryption.
                               NOTE 1: The key/password (if used) must be a
                                       contiguous string of characters with
                                       no blank spaces between any characters.
                               NOTE 2: If a key is entered for encryption, the
                                       same key must be entered for decryption.
                               NOTE 3: Encryption may be performed 2 or more
                                       times in sequence before decryption,
                                       using a different key each time, for
                                       additional encryption security.  In
                                       such case, the decryption steps must
                                       be performed in the reverse order
                                       (last encryption/first decryption).
                               NOTE 4: Encryption and decryption are mere
                                       complementary processes, so that if
                                       the decryption step were performed
                                       first, followed by encryption, the
                                       end effect would be the same.
      WARNING(!) Encryption changes the contents of a file, and if you cannot
                 perform the decryption process properly, including the use of
                 keys/passwords, you won't be able to recover the file at all.
                 Normally, before making changes to a file, you are advised
                 to make a backup copy of the file, but since the purpose of
                 encryption is to make the file unreadable and unusable, to
                 have a usable backup copy of the file on the same computer,
                 or even in the same area that the computer is located in,
                 wouldn't suit the primary purpose of encryption.
NOTES: If maximum security is the objective, you might want to encrypt a file
       several times (in several passes) with a different encryption key each
       pass, using different programs, and mixing the encryption/decryption
       order (OK as long as different keys are used).  Examples:
ENCRYPT.BAT (encrypt the file; see Note 4 above concerning the /d switch)
bcrp filename  /d  Little_Miss_Muffet_Sat_On_Her_Tuffet
ccrp filename  /e  The_Quick_Brown_Fox_Jumped_Over_The_Lazy_Dog
bcrp filename  /e  We_Have_Met_The_Enemy_And_They_Are_Us
ccrp filename  /d  Let_Him_That_Hath_Understanding_Count_The_Number_Of_The_Beast
DECRYPT.BAT (decrypt the file; see Note 4 above concerning the /e switch)
ccrp filename  /e  Let_Him_That_Hath_Understanding_Count_The_Number_Of_The_Beast
bcrp filename  /d  We_Have_Met_The_Enemy_And_They_Are_Us
ccrp filename  /d  The_Quick_Brown_Fox_Jumped_Over_The_Lazy_Dog
bcrp filename  /e  Little_Miss_Muffet_Sat_On_Her_Tuffet

I presume heirarchical authority.  That's what we had in the U.S., even in the 1960's.  The specific authorities running bogus juries were generally county-level.  One could argue that the states, and by extension the feds, looked the other way as long as they could, and indeed they did.
Once they could no longer look the other way, those higher-level authorities should have proceeded against the local governments as I specified, rather than undermining the Constitutional enumerations.
If there should happen to be a good argument that the feds and states couldn't proceed against the locals because these higher-level authorities were somehow compromised (other than general scumbagness), I'd like to know how.

Sometimes I wonder if I came from another planet, or is everyone experiencing the same thing, i.e., I have two relatives high up in Scientology (recruiting, placement, fundraising), several in LDS, even a Pagan or two, and I'm not even from California.
If the Mormon database is so innocuous, why are they so *desperate* to build it?  Genealogical?  If you ever rode on a train, a plane, or took a cruise, you're in it.  They have everything.  Or, in the vein of Hoover or Wackenhut, "you can never have enough".

I was in L.A. County Court in 1986, and I noticed a TV reporter in the bleachers.  The judge gave an injunction to some neighbors that their neighbors could not sell drugs, sleep on the lawn, etc., and it became big news then, since nobody had ever thought of that before.
So it looks like the law is evolving....

True, but what's reported is a joke, just like other media scams.
I didn't say no possibility, just very little probability.  And what motive did this wealthy man have to savagely (inhumanly, yet) murder those two people?  There are people who have plausible motives, though.
CIA, remotely?  I guess Colby, Jr. living next to Nicole is outside the boundary of remote?  I guess A.C.'s boss Ippolito, *close* friend of George Aronow, *close* friend of George Bush, etc. is also out of bounds?  Ever hear of international coke rings?  OJ was up to his neck in Mob, and looks like Denise Brown likewise.  Too remote for you?
Lessee, an apple and a banana are "not even remotely comparable", due to so many differences, etc.  But, I can eat both of them, and get nutrition from both, so, they *do* have quite a bit in common.
The Warren Commission, and all "official" treatments of the JFK assassination were not based on the real evidence, nor was the OJ trial. If you're one of those people who saw Ruby do it, and you said "gee, musta been just another wacko", then you could look at the OJ trial the same way and say "gee, just another crazy black man", etc.

The only reason I would bother to mention this is merely to caution people to think: What could *possibly* happen if the shoe were on the other foot.  If the Constitution is about anything at all, it's about balance of power, and when *any* power transfers more to one interest than another, interesting changes can occur.
BTW, there have been articles in the L.A. Times about attempts by persons not of the Mormon faith to prevent Mormons from dominating the cultural life in SLC schools, other public venues, etc.  This raises the eternal question: Can a group live the way *it* wants to without interference, or is group culture always going to constitute a threat to persons in the vicinity who don't share that culture?

Sounds to me like there's a need for a program that can produce secure encryption, yet the output looks like "real junk", i.e., not anything like what one of the *better* programs would produce.  Then you can claim (with testimony of experts if necessary) that "I didn't encrypt it, must be just garbage".  And even if you got some bozo govt. person testifying against you, you shouldn't have much problem making them look stupid and vindictive in front of a jury.

@_subject: Utah as a Religious Police State [RANT] 
I hope I can add something useful to this:
There are quite a few religious groups which claim Zionist spinoff beliefs.  Rastafarians (spelling OK?), Mormons, Jews, Christians, and probably a host of others.  Some of these groups specifically exclude others who make similar claims.  There is good evidence that the Jews, to name one example, did not originally (whenever that was) make claim to being a Chosen People, etc., but added it later.  Certainly Mormons and other Christians "added it later", no question about that.
St. Paul in the Christian "new testament" makes it quite clear that, at least from his time onward, the value of being a Jew is in the spirit, not in the flesh.  Deep stuff, indeed.
Then there's the question of how one obtains the "right to exist" as an ethnic identity, hopefully without having to exterminate someone else.
I for one was raised in a very conservative Christian culture, and we were taught that God "gave" Canaan (later Israel) to the Israelis, when it was already occupied.  Refer to Dick Gregory's comments about Columbus "discovering" America, and how he should be able to go downtown and "discover" himself a Cadillac.
BTW, in a review of HP products I once read (they made the first personal computers, circa 1966 I believe), it said that HP people, in their main plants in Corvallis OR and Ft. Collins CO, had a really great "work ethic", and that they were almost all Mormons and "born again" Christians.  That probably says more about homogenous culture than about any particular culture, I would guess.
Bottom line for me is, I sincerely appreciate a lot of the good values some of these religions bring to their followers, but let's be serious, if any of these groups get too much power, look the *hell* out!
P.S.  I cringe every time I hear one of the CNN bozos pronounce Israel
      as in real estate, or get real.  I think they all have to attend
      the Rick Dees school of broadcasting, so it's a standard, like
      GAK or something is going to be the standard.

I think you will find ultimately that personal communication is just that, i.e., personal.  OTOH, the means by which that communication are effected (phones, computers, with or without encryption) are the things that the government wants to control, presumably to get at information that you and I couldn't conveniently communicate in person, in private.
The very idea that people don't have the right to hide their private conversations from *anyone*, including police, is ludicrous, and can't possibly be enforced, but the devices (if any) that are used, that's another matter.

The point is, the govt. already has the info, much as if you had a bunch of computers and digiboards or whatever monitoring all your neighbors' phone calls.  It's whether they can legally present the info in court to put you away or not that matters.  The law tends to move in the direction of recent decisions, particularly in saying that the police "acted in good faith" in collecting the info, and that they "didn't conspire to collect the info deliberately knowing it wasn't legal", etc.
Problem is, the govt. will continue to ease the restrictions on the latter argument, since in the former, they *always* act in "good faith".

Frankly, it doesn't matter per se what "your people" pledge to do or not do, what matters is you, and me, and other individuals who *learn* not to kill, and to not have a desire to kill, and so forth.
"Your people" are always going to frighten others and stir up paranoia, for the very simple reason that:  1. They're human, and therefore are predators, and  2. In a large group like the Mormons, they have real power.  And this applies to all such groups, BTW.

Did y'all see the NBC (I think, got this from a friend) ad for the new
monitoring system for cars?  It's based apparently on the lo-jac (spelling unsure) technology, but expanded so the monitor can locate the car anytime immediately, and can determine all car statuses such as whether the engine is on (and the monitor can kill that), how much gas is in the car, whether the windows are up, roof up, everything basically.  So if they want to detain somebody, they turn off the engine, put the windows up, lock the doors, and have someone come and get you (you're locked in until they get there, see).
BTW, this is a reality now.  This was an ad for a current service.
This apparently is part of the reason why all cars now are moving in the direction of more electronic features, all of which can be put under centralized control.

You seem to be missing or confusing some points:
AP, as I understand it, is not necessarily revenge, any more than any other type of business deal.  You don't stab the competitor primarily because you wanna get revenge, you just do it as a practical matter, to lessen the competition.  You fail to grasp the predatory reality of what humans really are, and in that failure of illumination, you succumb to the illusion that humans are something closer to divine spirits than, say, a hawk, an eagle, or a wildcat.
Your religious beliefs are fine, I'm sure, as far as they go, but if you can agree with the principle of "separation of church and state", then you should see that trying to apply one's own personal religious convictions in dealing with the people who run Mother Earth is a fool's game.  Go to church, worship God, then, when you're doing business, treat people with the same courtesy you'd want from them.  The original Golden Rule.
You already agree that police killings *may* be justified, i.e., are not necessarily murder, then, as though "the people" have no right to apply the same techniques themselves (they "must" surrender this option to the state etc.), you label what the people would do as murder.  Bottom line is not whether AP would be murder, but whether you think the people have an inherent obligation to always surrender the right to kill to govt. authorities, even in a state where the govt. authorities are far beyond the point of "trust".
The last point about only a few players being able to afford AP is also shortsighted, from what I understand.  The collective anonymous contributions of a lot of little people could help unseat a much larger tyrant, which should go a long way in helping the tyrant control

If you recorded the debates yourself, and if you could do the analysis (much easier than faking anything), you'd have something to compare to the talking-head versions from TV.  Unfortunately, the major media will not likely present any voice-analysis info unless it's done by one or two of the nation's top labs, which (it goes without saying) get most of their work presumably from government agencies.

Most of America is still to the right of you on a map, and close to 95

"x-percent of white people think he's guilty" (usually 70 percent or
thereabouts), while I, Dale Thorn, found it to be just about 100 percent
anywhere in the country (except maybe the Bay Area, where they still

A lot of B.S. has been discussed for several decades.
These last numbers - "less than 50%", "complete errors like 95%" are splendid proofs of what I said in the first paragraph above, that most people (like yourself) are totally controlled by their programming.  Unless, of course, you simply wave it all away with a magic wand.
BTW, if you understood my argument, it wasn't so much about specifics of religion et al (which could be easily misinterpreted), it was about how people act entirely on their past programming, mitigated to some extent by incidental circumstances.  If you're inclined to give too much weight to the incidental circumstances, remember the first thing they tell you when you join the CIA: there aren't any coincidences (of any real significance, anyway).

The laws were developed to protect the big guys and their investments, be it the Constitution (protecting slave owners and the Yankee investors who depended on Southern production), the USC and UCC, or NAFTA and GATT.
Serve the people.  Good idea.  Assassination has been serving the big guys essentially unimpeded by public objection or protest, so how can a person argue against AP without first applying the objection to govt.?
When the U.S. Justice Dept. can fake evidence to "get" someone they don't like (Demjanjuk, for example), and then the Israeli supreme court, realizing that the U.S. govt. has far less integrity than they'd imagined, had to release the man because of this embarassment, in spite of vehement opposition in their own back yard, what do we do then?
Actually, when the authorities become as corrupt as they have in the U.S., the law of the jungle is already applied defacto to the masses anyway.  Again, laws mainly protect those the lawmakers serve, and the little people get just the crumbs when the system is more-or-less young and working.

Seems to me there's a difference between "the only time messages are read" and "the only time messages are *supposed* to be read".  Since Bert says the former, you have to wonder...   And as far as "regular monitoring for compliance" goes, does the Post Office monitor first class mail now ("regular monitoring")?  Do they have a monitoring law besides the ability to open letters with a warrant?
I hate to be rude Bert, but for the zillionth time, what you oppose is entire irrelevant to this subject, unless you are *the* decision maker in designing binding crypto products and making attendant regulations.
Well, Bert, who do you blame for the mass of cameras going up all over Los Angeles? (Not to mention small, neighborhood microwave transceivers)
In the U.S., there's a thoroughly-implemented concept called co-opting, well described in senate hearings on intelligence circa 1974-1976. Fortunately, you were able in the above paragraph to get past the "choosing your own TRP" clause, and show the real cards.  So where in the U.S. are you gonna get TRP's who will not *ever* "leak" your files to an interested agency without proper warrant?
Whoops!  Looks like I spoke too soon.
And which trust is that, Bert?  They sure as hell don't trust us, now do they?  And unless you can show exactly where and when the "corruption" occurred, how do you know what was compromised?
How does it protect from criminals?  Only non-criminals (or extremely stupid criminals) will submit their data to a third party.
One principle you should keep in mind, Bert, and that is that cypherpunks are not merely paranoid (paranoia as a Way Of Knowing), they're very adept at telling you exactly how the criminals and terrorists will get around this hokum, and you're in denial about it.

Well, sad to say, a lot of Navajos are being used as intermediaries for "black-ops" projects.  It's the sovereignty scam (used when it's useful to them), like British subjects intercepting U.S. phone calls, etc.
You're getting close to something.  There's going to have to be a definition of intent for international (and eventually domestic) audio communications, to establish the originator's intent, even ignoring stego issues.
If they're not careful, they could open up a juicy can of worms.  For example, when the L.A. Times ran a recent headline to the effect that areas around China were becoming a hotbed of weapons dealing and so on, you could interpret that (if you're paying attention) as an invitation to weapons dealers and buyers to "come and get it while it's hot".
Look at the time lines for getting secure crypto into the hands of the more-or-less average person, then imagine a much shorter time line for the spinoff programs that do these specialized tasks. Short time lines don't give bureaucrats much time to work with, so if such programs get into wide use, the govt. will have to generalize the prohibitions more than they've announced so far.

You can't exactly resist them, that's true....
How much limiting you can effect depends on how badly they want whatever info.... Just like some people say that the answer to problem speech is more free speech, not suppression, I say the only answer to the NSA (shy of pulling their funding somehow) is to simply throw so much stuff their way that they can't have live people read it, and they can't sort through it with profiling progams etc. since all of it would look so interesting that they couldn't just discard it.
You could even (and please don't quote me on this) flood them with "really interesting" looking snake-oil crypto, or fairly easily breakable e-messages with buzz words that require human operators to analyze.  This latter item would require the originators to familiarize themselves with current (and rapidly changing) street slang for such concepts as "doing a hit", "bombing a car", "kidnapping an executive", and so on.
People on this list are lining up resources to crack single DES, ostensibly to hold up in front of some Congressional committee and say "look, we did it, now you'll have to cancel your export proposals", etc.  Well, I spent a number of hours with people like Willis Carto and Bob Fletcher, who have waved a great deal of interesting stuff in front of Congressional committees, and look what it got them.  In Carto's case, bombed, raided, discredited and demonized, and bled of much money, and in Fletcher's case, shot, gassed, and his son chemically attacked with loss of lung, ....
I have to wonder, if we were to develop some disinformation software, and maintain a database to drive it, if we couldn't use some of the resources they're gonna throw at single-DES to create zillions of messages, each varying slightly in content (the main function of the disinfo software), and with randomized headers to defeat the NSA filters and whatever.  It should not be at all difficult to cull a list of interesting places to send the messages to....
If Jim Bell's AP is to be the free man's bastion of last resort, one might consider in the meantime organizing a network of anonymous disinformers, who could generate and dispense disinformation as screensaver app's on whatever CPU's they have lying around.
Just exploring the idea of how much and what content would provoke the NSA et al would be great fun, and very educational.  The only *serious* crypto required, I think, would be for assuring anonymity over a long period of time, for a number of participants.
Since you couldn't monitor the NSA response directly, you'd also need to analyze a wide variety of media to look for hints about same.  If enough people got involved, there would be more opportunity for specialization of this sort.

So Bert, let's just call a spade a spade, eh?  Since you readily agree that organized criminals probably won't use binding crypto, and that TRP's will probably leak our info to spy "agencies" and so on, then that would make your system yet another of those programs that can't monitor organized crime directly, but instead harasses non-criminal citizens in the hope that the agencies can eventually get to the criminals via an indirect connection, i.e., the citizen happens to buy something at a web site run by Crime, Inc. (assuming that Crime, Inc. is not in fact just another agency-run sting operation).
As far as fraud is concerned, my main concern is that important (or any) documents etc. are not forged, including my personal communications.  This is particularly important to prevent frame-ups, which run rampant in the U.S.  I suppose they don't frame people in your country.  Well, it's public knowledge that the Justice Dept. does this sort of thing here, so knowing that, are you still suggesting we trust them, simply because you trust your government?  Or are you suggesting that with all of this new technology, that the U.S. Justice Dept. will evolve into a more ethical agency like your govt. allegedly has, instead of the other way around?

C'mon now, you guys sound like a bunch of old men, groaning over the checkers board about how you can't keep track of the six or seven medications you take every day.
Some amazing and true facts:  I'm 50 years old, learning Windows programming (yuk!), and actually, never went to college, but make good money writing code and also teach other programmers certain techniques....  I can also run a mile in six minutes, and haven't missed a day of work since 1975.
People die, things die, so what.  There are so many things to do, and not enough people to do them.  Get busy and you'll feel better.
Don't expect anything to be static.  The "right kind" of talented people will find the other like-mind folks, on this list or elsewhere.  It doesn't need to be managed or True invention as a concept is controversial.  One could make a valid argument that "new" inventions, while not new in every way, or even in a way that has agreed-upon significance, are nonetheless as inventive in many cases as the great ones like the telephone, the laser, or the public key concept. Perhaps you could analogize judgement of a particular invention to judgement of a person's intelligence - no clear, concise table of numbers to work from.
"Pinnacle" appears to be another (possibly flawed) judgement, usually be persons who don't fully understand the methods and motivations of individuals who have "great" There's a scene in the old Star Trek, in one of the very first episodes, when Gary somebody-or-other starts getting a *lot* smarter after passing through a barrier at the edge of the galaxy.  Kirk walks into the sick bay, and seeing Gary(?) reading some really deep stuff on the computer, says something to the effect "I never knew you got into person xxx, etc.", to which Gary replies "actually, he's kind of simple once you do get into him, childlike, even."
My suggestion is, learn to be more like that (you can, actually), and save the nostalgia for appropriate situations.  Don't put yourself down with all that hero-worship.  That's for kids.

This is exactly why the hell *we* shouldn't be in Bosnia.
Very simple explanation. You go to that much trouble (murder) when you *really* need to get some SOB or parasite off of your back.  I'm still not sure BTW how to relate to the betting pools, etc., as a (relatively) healthy market-driven instrument.
If you're talking about the "new" KKK (a la David Duke), forget it.  Duke was and is a CIA agent, from his missions in SE Asia for his father circa late 1960's. It's amazing how much of this media hooey sticks in people's brains.  Did you know that the largest contingents of KKK members of all time, by far (50,000 per city), were in Akron and Columbus, Ohio?  And where the KKK originated, in SE Tennessee (about a mile from where I worked for four years), is also where one of the greatest events for freedom ever took place - an armed uprising of the citizenry with its sole purpose to get an honest vote count for local sheriff, which they did. It'd be nice to get a public vote count today.
As far as contract killers with an agenda of their own, Joey the Hit Man (a real person, and very scary) says that professional killers very rarely kill for personal reasons outside of getting paid.  Just don't do something stupid like John Gotti's next-door neighbor did, and backing out of your driveway, accidentally back over Gotti's daughter and kill her.
This in some ways is the most crucial question in these rants.  Are you saying that society can really reject digital cash?  That it will go away completely when this society says it should?  I guess I'm to assume here that the "secret" agencies will maintain use of such cash for their purposes, while *preventing* the rest of us from using it somehow.
Can I assume that since the Internet is global, that e-cash will be too?
A lot of people make disparaging remarks about "third world" countries, where you have to bribe everyone to get anywhere. But can these ranters really claim that the U.S. is any different when it comes down to serious issues?  Try attending some city council meetings, with the intention to "make a difference", and you'll see what I mean.

I read the DOI, and its meaning was clear. It stated that while people are disposed to put up with the excesses of govt. to a certain bearable extent, that when the govt. tilted toward totalitarianism, the people should revolt. How can you say "Self Evident" and "extremely abstract" in the same context?  Self evident merely means that when you subtract out the factors of disinformation that are applied in political/economic areas to guarantee the cash flow to the bosses, you can see clearly that nobody has a Right, "divine" or whatever, to rule someone else.  It's not abstract, religious, or anything. Think of the analogy in sound reproduction.  The salesman is trying to tell you that perfect reproduction doesn't exist, so you should consider that $20,000 system to be like a "very fine musical instrument".  On the other hand, your finely-tuned mind is aware that there is an "true original" sound that you're trying to reproduce, and whether it's 100% attainable is not the relevant issue. In other words, don't let the bosses confuse you with their rhetoric, if you're well-read and intelligent, you should be able to trust your own instincts.  That's what self-evident means.
As to the removal of "God", they said "...endowed by their Creator...", and I think that Creator when capitalized is more than clear, i.e., "God".  Almost all of the signers were Freemasons, whose membership requires belief in God (although I don't know that they require extensive testing as to how their members conceptualize God), and so it would appear that the exclusion of the term God would be more an act of conciliation or even superstition than a rejection of anything.

[remainder deleted]
You could ask yourself, as a technical matter of some importance, just
how you came to be thinking about purpose, or about it in the way that
you think about it, i.e., was the thought developed in you through
bombardment from "philosophical" sources, or did you actually develop it
independently?  Try to track that down and deconstruct it, and it will
help in getting a handle on the issues you want to look at.
On the other hand, you could try what I call the Consciousness
Experiment. Intelligent persons have argued (contrary to the notions of
certain religious philosophies and possibly even quantum physicists)
that there is no *free will*, since all *things* are fully predictable,
given sufficient detachment from the universe being studied, and
sufficient resources to analyze the motions of all particles, waves,
and/or other constructs.
In the Consciousness Experiment, you get up every day and attempt to do
something *good* for which you have absolutely no motivation, kinda like
a "Mother Teresa act" or whatever.  Use your imagination.  The goal is
to separate your "purely altruistic" (for sake of argument, whether this
is real or not) acts from your base acts, i.e., eating, sleeping, and
even loving (in the sense of attachment to particular persons as opposed
to living beings or "earth things" as a whole).
If you can stay focused on the goal, to "prove" that you truly are a
sentient being and not just a living-flesh motivation-driven automaton,
then eventually you will have an answer of sorts to your question, but
with your mind in a different frame of reference or perspective, I
believe you'll be somewhat amused at your original posting on this
topic, assuming you keep a copy around.

Short history of Wriston/Reagan ripoff: 1982, Wriston (speaking of Willie Sutton, "I rob banks because that's where the money is") said "I look out over the American landscape and I see 1.2 trillion dollars in Savings and Loans...."

New  CCRP  documentation - changes as of 29.10.1996
----------Command----------    ------------------Output-------------------
CCRP                           Usage parameters.
CCRP  filename  /e             Encrypt each byte in 'filename' so that the
                               data cannot be seen, or, if the file was an
                               executable file, it cannot be executed.
CCRP  filename  /d             Decrypt (restore) each byte in 'filename'.
CCRP  filename  /e  key        Encrypt or decrypt 'filename', but add an
CCRP  filename  /d  key        additional factor (a key, or a password)
                               to the encryption and decryption.
                               NOTE 1: The key/password (if used) must be a
                                       contiguous string of characters with
                                       no blank spaces between any characters.
                               NOTE 2: If a key is entered for encryption, the
                                       same key must be entered for decryption.
                               NOTE 3: Encryption may be performed 2 or more
                                       times in sequence before decryption,
                                       using a different key each time, for
                                       additional encryption security.  In
                                       such case, the decryption steps must
                                       be performed in the reverse order
                                       (last encryption/first decryption).
                               NOTE 4: Encryption and decryption are mere
                                       complementary processes, so that if
                                       the decryption step were performed
                                       first, followed by encryption, the
                                       end effect would be the same.
CCRP  filename  /p             'Pad' 8th bits in 'filename', which must be a
                               '7-bit' ASCII file.  If any 8th bits were set
                               before this option is invoked, a message will
                               be displayed to that effect and changes will
                               not occur.  If all bytes in 'filename' have
                               ASCII values less than 128, then no 8th bits
                               are currently set in that file.
                               If the total number of 1-bits in 'filename' are
                               greater than or equal to the number of 0-bits
                               in the file, a message will be displayed to that
                               effect and, as above, changes will not occur.
                               This option will set only enough 8th bits to
                               equalize the 1-bits and 0-bits in the file,
                               or as many 8th bits as possible if the total
                               bytes in the file (only the 8th bit can be set)
                               are less than the number of 0-bits minus the
                               number of 1-bits in the file.
                               The purpose of bit-padding is to 'normalize' the
                               number of 1-bits in a file before encryption, to
                               further obscure the nature of the source text.
                               The intent of CCRP is actually to NOT alter any
                               bits during encryption, but rather to move them
                               into random positions within the file, so that
                               attackers cannot determine which bits belong to
                               which bytes, etc.  Bit-padding gets around this
                               requirement in that it can only be invoked as a
                               command option separate from an encryption step.
                               Note further that if bit-padding or un-padding
                               is attempted on a file which is in an encrypted
                               state, the file will be damaged beyond repair.
CCRP  filename  /u             'Unpad' 8th bits in 'filename', which must have
                               been a '7-bit' ASCII file prior to padding with
                               8th bits. This option has no warnings, and when
                               used on a file which was not originally '7-bit'
                               ASCII text, will damage the file beyond repair,
                               since the exact 8th bits to change back to 1's
                               cannot be determined.
      WARNING(!) Encryption changes the contents of a file, and if you cannot
                 perform the decryption process properly, including the use of
                 keys/passwords, you won't be able to recover the file at all.
                 Normally, before making changes to a file, you are advised
                 to make a backup copy of the file, but since the purpose of
                 encryption is to make the file unreadable and unusable, to
                 have a usable backup copy of the file on the same computer,
                 or even in the same area that the computer is located in,
                 wouldn't suit the primary purpose of encryption.
NOTES: If maximum security is the objective, you might want to encrypt a file
       several times (in several passes) with a different encryption key each
       pass, using different programs, and mixing the encryption/decryption
       order (OK as long as different keys are used).  Examples:
ENCRYPT.BAT (encrypt the file; see Note 4 above concerning the /d switch)
ccrp filename  /p
bcrp filename  /d  Little_Miss_Muffet_Sat_On_Her_Tuffet
ccrp filename  /e  The_Quick_Brown_Fox_Jumped_Over_The_Lazy_Dog
bcrp filename  /e  We_Have_Met_The_Enemy_And_They_Are_Us
ccrp filename  /d  Let_Him_That_Hath_Understanding_Count_The_Number_Of_The_Beast
DECRYPT.BAT (decrypt the file; see Note 4 above concerning the /e switch)
ccrp filename  /e  Let_Him_That_Hath_Understanding_Count_The_Number_Of_The_Beast
bcrp filename  /d  We_Have_Met_The_Enemy_And_They_Are_Us

FAQ for Cryptography Of A Sort (COAS)
Author  : Dale Thorn Revised : 27 Oct 1996
Q: Is COAS an actual product?
A: COAS is an encryption engine supplied in source-code format, which
   calls some commonly-available (and replaceable) functions included
   with commercial computer-language libraries, which in turn perform
   some of the rudimentary tasks required by the program.  Public Key
   features are not currently supported in COAS, therefore, messaging
   applications are not as well supported as is local file encryption.
Q: What are the main differences between COAS and other non-messaging-oriented
   crypto products?
A: 1. COAS repositions bits based on multiple encoding passes using one or more
      Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNG's).  Since COAS is provided only in
      source code format, and since the source code calls the PRNG function in
      the compiler library(s), COAS is actually independent of specific PRNG's.
      NOTE: PRNG limitations, as described in the popular literature, do not
            necessarily apply when repositioning bits in multiple passes, as
            opposed to modifying bits as is normally done in other software.
            Think of "brute force encryption" (more on this below).
   2. COAS does not use a "key" as such, and thus does not "encrypt" the bits
      in a text bitstream.  Instead, it uses an input value (text or numeric)
      as an entry point into a common PRN sequence.  Since the entry point is
      a secret, and since bits are moved using random block sizes, from their
      original bytes into unrelated destination bytes, cryptanalytic attempts
      must necessarily begin with brute-force guessing as to the entry points
      in the PRN sequences, in order to associate the correct bits with their
      original bytes of text.  Multiple encoding passes raise the number of
      guesses exponentially.
   3. COAS source code is extremely small, the primary intent for which was
      to provide a sample encoding engine for local/personal computer files.
      Due to its small size and simplicity, the source code can be easily
      modified by casual users, who may add in their own custom routines.
      NOTE: It cannot be overemphasized, that crypto programs which have
            a widely-respected reputation must also be held suspect when
            A) The very nature of those programs is to deceive, -and-
            B) The source code is either not available, or is so complex
               as to discourage ordinary people from working with it.
Q: But if COAS uses a common, ordinary PRNG, how can it possibly be secure?
A: I can think of two arguments against using PRNG's:
   1. Encoded text is easy to decode by brute force on most computers, -and-
   2. Encoded text can be seen as having regular patterns when "viewed" from
      the vantage point of programs employing higher-dimensional mathematics.
   Addressing the former, a single-pass encryption of a text file using the
   typical PRNG might be breakable in as little as .000001 second on one of
   the larger, faster computers available, however, the same approach might
   require as many as 10^24 years if the number of encoding passes reaches
   ten or more.  To simplify: try to guess the number I'm thinking between
   zero and 32,000.  You can make 16 billion guesses per second, so it will
   take only .000001 second (on average) to get the correct answer.  If you
   had to guess ten numbers correctly (and sequentially), it would require
   roughly (16,000^10) / 16,000,000,000 seconds, approximately 10^24 years.
   Addressing the latter, the ability to "view" the text as a lattice in a
   higher dimension is likewise diminished by the discontinuities inherent
   in multi-pass encoding, when bit-group sizes are determined dynamically
   by PRN's following the secret entry points into the PRNG sequences.
Q: Since COAS only moves bits and doesn't change any of them, wouldn't that
   make cryptanalysis much easier, since the number of 0-bits and 1-bits in
   the encrypted file would be identical to the numbers in the source file?
A: While the COAS encryption processes don't actually change any bits, the
   bit-padding and de-padding options in versions 3.x and above will allow
   you to change 8th bits to 1's in "7-bit" ASCII text, after which you do
   any encryption steps followed (eventually) by decryption and de-padding.
Q: What about the possibility that two or more encryption passes could be
   decrypted in a single pass, as in the scenario where a third key K3 is
   functionally equivalent to two separate encrypting keys K1 and K2?
A: Since COAS encoding is controlled through entry points into a PRNG's
   number sequences (adjacent encryptions may also use different PRNG's
   and/or bit-move logic), searching for a "key" or algorithm which can
   unpack two or more layers of coding will prove futile when all entry
   points into the PRNG's are different, and different PRNG's are used.
   A couple of points to consider:
   One, the output of the PRNG (or any number series) does not describe
   the bit move-to locations; those are determined by sorting the PRN's
   then moving the bits according to the sequence of the original array
   positions of the PRN's prior to sorting. Since some of the PRN's are
   duplicates, the original array positions relative to each other will
   be determined by chance, i.e., the vagaries of the sort process, etc.
   Two, since the bits are moved rather than modified, and since groups
   of bits vary in size, an attempt to find particular bits that belong
   to specific bytes after multi-move shuffling, using any compound key
   or algorithm in a single decoding pass, will certainly prove futile.
Q: Since the personal computer implementation of COAS uses 16-bit integers to
   initialize (set entry points into) the PRNG's, would ten encryption passes
   be somehow equivalent to the use of a 160-bit key in conventional programs?
A: If the conventional program used a 160-bit key in a manner similar to COAS,
   it would still have to:  1) move bits, not change them. 2) use an indirect
   method for specifying move locations.  3) model the processes used in COAS
   quite closely, since there's no straightforward mathematical approach that
   can duplicate the conditions described in the previous question and answer.
Q: What's the difference between the techniques used by COAS and the use of a
   One-Time Pad (OTP)?
A: The theory behind the OTP assumes that (unlike the use of a Public/Private
   key) subsequent encryptions using the same OTP key would reveal the nature
   of the OTP, i.e., any newly-encoded files and messages would share certain
   common identifiable characteristics which could be exploited to facilitate
   the decryption of all files using that pad.
   COAS, on the other hand, doesn't alter any of a file's bits, and therefore
   does not "add" its PRNG entry points' characteristics to a file other than
   shuffling bits in accordance with the original physical positions of PRN's
   which have been sorted by size.
Q: Is it possible for anyone to alter the contents of files encrypted by COAS
   so that a person performing the eventual decryption would not realize that
   the file(s) were indeed altered?
A: Less likely than incidental or brute-force decryption.  Each bit is moved
   once in each encryption pass, and if any bits were moved or changed, that
   many bytes (or nearly as many, since bits are not moved in byte-divisible
   groups, so most will end up in unrelated bytes after encryption) would be
   affected, and the resulting bytes would not likely pass even the simplest
   checksum test.
Q: Is COAS a "weak" product (cryptographically speaking), either because of
   limitations in its own internal algorithms, or in the commercial library
   functions it calls?
A: COAS can be used in ways that produce weak encryption, which is really
   an advantage in encouraging beginners to get started, given its simple
   user interface. Whether it can produce "strong" encryption or not is a
   matter of opinion, where said opinion is not so much a function of the
   product's alleged weaknesses, as it is the fact that cryptography grew
   up from a long history of hand-ciphering and the mathematics attending
   that growth, and the obvious resistance to new paradigms in this field.
   While mathematical proof of encryption strength is highly desirable in
   most applications (some would argue essential in certain applications),
   I see things this way:  Computer software of any kind, which cannot be
   analyzed by common persons (average programmers), whose innards cannot
   be exposed to the masses for whatever reason, should not be used where
   it could effect control over the lives of those people.  Looking at it
   a different way, it's wise for any individual or group to evaluate the
   software that's available, and make their own judgements independently
   of "expert opinion" in the field.

"News" stories are now circulating on radio about child pornography on the Internet, and how an organization called "Save The Children" is working very hard to identify the trafficers and their accomplii.
Save The Children is complaining that they can't find all of the dirty dealers of kid-porn, since much of the traffic is encrypted!
So who is Save The Children? First, since they're an international organization raising funds in the U.S., they obviously operate at the pleasure of the State Department. Ho hum. Remember the incidents at the Denny's restaurant chain where Denny's was sued for discrimination against minorities? Did it seem a little bizarre for the 1990's?
At the close of the litigation, Denny's suddenly sprouted tons of free fund-raising advertising for Save The Children, including placemats at each table with beautiful logo and address and phone number. Just send the money, etc. My questions to interested persons included whether someone may have approached Denny's for such cooperation BEFORE the discrimination suits, and whether Denny's may have refused at first.
Well, don't jump to conclusions, and this is *NOT* a veiled accusation.
I merely suggest that interested parties extend their inquiries into the various Internet-Monitors to include Save The Children. And by the way, I wonder what World Vision and National Medical Enterprises are up to these days?

I'm sure everyone is familiar with how newspaper articles are not necessarily "pure" news, i.e., they're often slanted toward a particular point of view.
Go back a few years, maybe 20 or more, and look at the front page of the L.A. Times (or probably any big-city paper). Many or most news pieces written by UPI, AP, etc., now 100% are written internally.
What y'all might want to think about is not just slanting and bias, but how certain people and organizations can actually *plant* a phony story on page one of a major paper like the L.A. Times. Go back a few months and check out the front-page article on real estate prices in the Calif. "Ventura Keys" area. Totally false. Story alleged that prices were "skyrocketing"; prices actually were absolutely flat, after having fallen by 35% or more in the previous couple of years.
Whoever authorized this story, if they didn't get a big kickback or gain some points for some future operation, then I can't imagine why they would print such a thing.
I hate to suggest anyone become more cynical than they already are, but, the front page(s) of a big-city newspaper are some of the most valuable real estate in western civilization, so do the math....

My two cents worth: Since the purpose of the forum is to explore issues affecting personal cryptography and privacy, etc., TWA 800 as an excuse to crank out privacy-depletion laws is certainly of concern here, though one could argue for sub-forums to cover related issues.
Reminds me of research into Simpson affair - can you really understand what such a case is all about without "shaking the bushes" and "raking the leaves" quite a bit? So much essential data is avoided by both sides who have pre-determined agendas, that we're left with broken threads of inquiry everywhere. One could argue that Simpson is inconsequential, until one considers changes to the law, particularly to citizen juries.
Perhaps the ideal would be a top-level forum for crypto-specific issues, then sub-forums for specific related topics, and a catch-all sub-forum for related messages not fitting into the specific sub-forums.

Per the tendency of federal agencies to let it be publicly known that they lie openly to trap suspects (and apparently this technique has been OK'd for local enforcement as well):
This is going to backfire on them (and us), and probably has already.
If govt. protects its "sources and methods", however nefarious, to the extent that the public is never asked to assent to these methods (even though a few of us know about them anyway), then the public doesn't have to become overtly cynical about what's going on.
On the other hand, whether you think the people have this much right to know or not, when the public consciousness embraces the concept that the police openly and regularly lie (and that it's a "good thing" they do), the result will be greater public cynicism, distrust, paranoia, hatred, and anarchy (the bad kind).

This seems similar to the Declaration-of-Independence argument about the "right of the people to overthrow the govt.", etc.
You can't expect the Constitution (a doctrine of law) to provide details on extra-legal activities such as violent overthrow of the govt., nor can you expect judges to explain in court how to ignore the Law.
And if all else fails, you can try picketing...
A well-written company charter (as an example) would contain provisions for exceptions to the charter, not to abrogate or undermine the charter, but just as a kind of escape valve. One would note the exception(s) for historical purposes, and for purposes of future litigation, and so on.
I can't help but wonder if the U.S. Constitution would have been better for something similar to this, instead of pasting on Amendments for every little thing.

@_subject: Cryptography of a sort - redux 
If anyone remembers my original postings from a couple weeks ago (my
first-ever on The Net), I described a method to "shuffle" bits in a
text-stream, using simple random-number generators, to insure that the
text cannot be descrambled by brute-force methods.
It has occurred to me only after this time that there was significant
misinterpretation of what I proposed. I do not change any bits of text,
I merely reposition them, therefore there is no applicability of
standard analysis techniques (XOR masking, whatever) to the decoding
process. The result file contains the same number of zero and one bits
as it started with, through any number of encryption layers.
The only way to recover the original text is to reposition the shuffled
bits correctly, which requires brute-force guessing of the
pseudo-random-number output. This guess is very simple for the first
encoding layer, but compounds exponentially in subsequent encodings, so
that after half a dozen or a dozen passes, where the executable
program(s) is called from scratch for each pass, the shuffling rapidly
approaches true randomness, and cannot be decrypted in practice except
through the exact mirror-image reversal of the encryption passes.
An example: How long would it take for you to guess the number (between
0 and 32000) I'm thinking of, if you could guess 16 billion numbers per
second? Would it be .000001 second, on average?
If you had to guess the ten different numbers I'm thinking of, and get
all ten correct sequentially, it should take an essentially infinite
amount of time, yes? And remember, since computer bits have such low
differentiation (ones and zeros), looking for "patterns" and so forth
just doesn't apply in this type of encryption.
As to the Public Key part of the argument, once there is general
understanding on the above points at large, it might then be worthwhile
to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of how to make/distribute Private keys, etc.
One gentleman on this forum made an argument recently, something to the
effect that it wouldn't be worthwhile for Hacker X to try to break into
datastream Y, assuming datastream Y is encoded with such-and-such a key,
that datastream Y is sufficiently unimportant, and motive for such a
breakin would not be great enough to justify the expected effort.
To such arguments, all I can say is, this is the computer age, and
enough mundane transactions can add up to something significant, or, one
could lower the expected-effort ratio, you get the picture.

This fascinating aspect of law enforcement described above is something you can test for yourself:
Probably whatever state of the U.S. you (might) live in issues you a driver's license, to obtain which you read a booklet and pass a test. Get your booklet and read everything your state mandates about defensive driving, particularly in maintaining a minimum safe distance from other vehicles, given current velocities.
Now try to practice that safety on your state freeways. You will:
1. Be severly harrassed, threatened, and possibly injured or killed (more-or-less deliberately) by another driver who feels it's his/her right (incorrectly of course) to mount your car anally, rather than simply go around.
2. Be harrassed by the state police for "obstructing traffic" (even though the other driver initiated the problem, illegally), because after all, the state police are told (subliminally, I guess) not to protect you, but rather to keep traffic moving, which is "good for business".
3. Be charged as the party at fault when another driver runs into the back of your car, even when you are travelling in a straight line, within five MPH of the speed limit, and the freeway is practically Needless to say, such a charge is not hard to turn around if you're smart and know how to write stinging letters to the insurance company, if not the state govt. It's just interesting as hell to see the police follow a different book than their (presumed) bosses, the state govt. Common reason would suggest that the police would view a true defensive driver as a "troublemaker" (some sort of anarchist, perhaps?), and want to get that driver back into "normal" driving mode, or off the road I mention this because you can't normally test police attitudes with the gun-firing approach, but you can with a car. If my instincts prove correct, however, few people who read this post will see the reason in it, being in the majority of aggressive neurotic drivers (just a guess).

Why not have the filter be more like a sieve, and dump the low-priority stuff into separate containers, then sort them by personal criteria such as message size, frequency of key words, etc.?  If you maintain multiple sorts, you can look over the stuff when you have a chance, and mass-dump a series of messages that don't make a cutoff you specify at read-time.
Since I write my own utilities, I can mix and match keyword parsers, multiple-indexed text browsing, and so on. Of course, the commercially-

I just wanna see one case where a federal judge will try to bleed a big company for contempt for "refusing" to decode and hand over some ostensibly encrypted data.

More to the point, if you can't figure out how to reform the offender (impossible in current prisons), and you can't get the offender to compensate the victim(s), you could at least tap into the perp's subconscious a little way and apply some inhibitors.
One technique that works on a lot of violence-prone individuals:
Chain the bad guy to a secure post in a dark basement somewhere, and leave them for 24 hours. On returning, flip on the light, give them a few seconds to be able to at least see your outline pretty well, then put an empty revolver next to their head and fire. Now turn off the light and leave.

Come now, surely you don't think putting assassination into the hands of the common people (Democracy, yes?  The same stuff Clinton is preaching all the time, remember?) is going to be worse than letting governments control all the action?  If you're going to allow governments to do the job, you and your fellow citizens should have been more involved in the political arena, to monitor these kinds of activities, so the government (of the U.S., for example) didn't have to get such a bad reputation.
A few years ago, William Torbitt (pseudonym) wrote in part: "Penal codes have had two historic purposes - to deter crime and reform the offender.
.....However, when the head of the National Police agency joins with a handful of other govt. leaders, and they both in turn throw in with organized crime to murder the president, and the people have an uneasy feeling that something of this nature has taken place, it is only natural that crime and violence increase, and the basic deterrent to crime has broken down."

I'm hearing even more strategy, it would seem.  I don't see the relevance of how govt. behaves (i.e., like a bad uncle who hangs around too long and molests the kids, etc.) to who's responsible.  If you live in the U.S., that govt. is your agent, carrying out your representatives' instructions, and paid with your tax dollars.  Unless and until this becomes a literal dictatorship (and there is a valid argument that it applies even then), you are responsible for whatever your paid agents do, from the street cop to the top politico.
It's too bad your fellow citizens shirk their duty and watch TV instead, but issuing the above kinds of denial doesn't take the blood off of your hands or mine.  Now maybe it would take God (for example) to judge whether you, I, or Joe Blow is more guilty, for lack of participation or some other citizen crime, but you can't put all the blame on your hired agents for their crimes, when you know very well what kinds of things they do, and you continue to fund them.  You have to be considered an accessory, at least.

When you get right down to it, this calls for a mini-encyclopedia of crypto products (or even sub-products such as pre-processors or "encryption engines").
The basic outline for any products included (and don't forget, just getting included is some sort of endorsement, if you know what I mean) could be a feature/bug listing, using common crypto terminology, and could be followed by side-by-side argument paragraphs from the author and from a reputable review panel.
The usefulness of the list would probably depend on:
1. The participation of all those names people like to name-drop on this

2. And/or the quality of the list itself if done without (1.) above.

People have argued for genetic disposition to certain things, and I think they are sometimes (most times?) confused between genetics per se (genes et al) and the way environment creates much of the being indirectly.  For example, you are born with a chemical factory inside of you.  The amount and timing of hormonal secretions from myriad sources inside the body has a dramatic effect on the development of the being, and environment has a dramatic effect on the amount and timing of said hormonal secretions.  You can bias the formula all you want, but it can go in unpredictable directions, due to the great variety of influences.

Please excuse my bluntness, but you obviously get your info out of a book, whereas I get mine from actual experience, which I can demonstrate quite well.

Your testimonial of IQ's is equally dubious, excepting you should come up with a test that measures actual intelligence.

I wonder how Sandy will take the vote on continuing or abandoning
the moderation experiment?
In most states, one juror out of 12 can kill a conviction.
In a revolution such as U.S. 1776, only a tiny percent of the people
supported the revolution.
Will Sandy go with a majority decision (pure democratic), or allow
the moderation to go away if a significant minority wants to kill it?

To me, 486 and 50 mhz suggest something HP is getting far removed from,
so don't expect much help there.  Few if any computer outlets will be
able to handle the HP peculiarities.  You shouldn't have any trouble
getting the general parts list off the internet here and there, and

Some of the guys in the HP user group have UNIX running on Vectras,
but they also use a full raft of hardware tools, which I don't have
access to.  There's an actual HP-48 calculator, complete in every way
including appearance, running on that version of UNIX.  Don't remember
the name, but it comes on a few CD's, and costs around $50.
To me, 486 and 50 mhz suggest something HP is getting far removed from,
so don't expect much help there.  Few if any computer outlets will be
able to handle the HP peculiarities.  You shouldn't have any trouble
getting the general parts list off the internet here and there, and
there used to be HP forums to provide off-line support on Vectra
hardware, but it might be harder with older equipment.
Suggestion: Call HP Palo Alto at 415-857-1501, and tell them you need

Naturally he hit a pothole.  Censorship has its price, and you
folks just discovered it.  But censors never give up, do they?
Especially when there are hidden agendas.
John Gilmore is so disrespectful of the human beings on this list
that he whines and complains about their "attitudes", as though
he had a right to control them.  What a jerk.
Not willing because of some additional burden?  No.  It's because you
were outed as a censor and a jerk, and you can't get back the respect
you previously had.  The sour grapes you're displaying here are worthy
of a little child, not an adult.
Read: I'm gonna take my bat and ball and go home...
Everything was fine until you decided to screw it up.  Then your
emotional, denying little brain trys to blame it on everyone else.
There are places to speak, and people try to speak in those places.
When they are cut off, then they complain.  Nobody complained before
you had an open forum that you weren't providing same.  That's your
denial kicking up, not mine.
Intended purpose?  Did you really believe that setting up an open
forum gave you the right (or any option) to control the content?
Are you so immature that you can't handle complaints?
I know a lot of things, especially after they've bit be in the ass.
Especially about censors and CIA-related trolls like yourself, who
set up forums to collect info on unsuspecting American citizens.

Your reputation is in the toilet.  You're nobody.  In fact, you're

Yet another accusation that Dimitri's purpose is to "shut it down".
The very fact that it's you who have the com puts the lie to that.
Another experiment run by the same incompetent bozo who screwed up
the first experiment.  Don't you clowns ever get it?  You do, but
then again, you have a hidden agenda.
So you think you've fulfilled your obligation?  There's only one
thing that will ever save you.  Get down on your knees and confess,
saying to God and the list subscribers what a pathetic sinner you
are, and beg for their forgiveness.  Then get to work for the people,

Funny, isn't it?  Those people who *allegedly* suffer the most dis-

If I were gay, which I'm not, I could get all the boyfriends I want.
But being heterosexual, I would very much like to have women friends
(just as friends mind you) for ordinary social purposes, yet it's not
that easy.  I'd guess the gays are much more liberal with their multi-
friendships than straight people are.
Another funny thing - I'm an ordinary English/Welsh/Dutch White person,
and I've had plenty of White friends, and an equal percentage of Black
friends given the number of Black people I've known, but I've never
had a friend who was gay or lesbian, as far as I know, and I think
I could tell.  I can only guess that the gays are very clique-ish,
or their brains are wired differently than non-gays.

was to hire Black ministers with engaging personalities to travel
thru the South to propagandize for birth control.  It was believed
that the best access to the Blacks was thru religion, and Sanger's
steering committee wanted to create the illusion that these projects
were under the control of the local Black leaders.

If you really intended to do this as an experiment, this method would
not work.  The way it works (and what she meant I believe):
1. Start with 100. Observe them very briefly and pick the most obvious
   candidates from immediately-discernable features. How accurate this
   would be is not so much hit or miss by misidentification as it is
   making too broad an evaluation on the first round.
2. Now that you've eliminated the most obvious of the gays and the
   most obvious non-gays, take only what's left and observe for
   somewhat longer, and you should be able (if you're as good as her)
   to pick off quite a few more.  In the end, of course, there has
   to be doubt about quite a few, which is the whole point of having
   a non-discriminatory policy, so that nobody feels compelled to
   make judgements where they are not warranted.
If you think I'm carrying this too far, check out the comedy movie
with Tom Hanks and Sally Field, where Hanks identifies a Jewish
doctor by superficial appearance alone.  It's my only point.

and sociopaths", etc. that I try not to reply to any of the crud I
see posted by those clowns.  But when someone tries to be reasonable,

1. Disrupters don't like bullies.
2. Disrupters don't like mindless authorities.
3. Disrupters don't like control freaks.
4. Disrupters don't like liars and hypocrites.
5. Disrupters don't like NSA/CIA/DEA/FBI trolls.
6. Disrupters don't like Animal Farm policies and elitists.
In short, if Gilmore had come down on the real problem people once
in a while, they wouldn't have agitated the "disrupters" nearly as
much as they did.  But he wasn't about to do that, because he's one

I thought Einstein's ideas on social matters (incl. religion) were
naive and sentimental.  There's a difference in saying "I believe
there's a God" and "I believe in a God".  Of course, either way one
could be implying a hidden or unspecified set of agendas concomitant
with such a belief.
In the movie "Jesus Of Nazareth" is a classic example of why to
believe or not believe in a religion, i.e. things unseen:
At the end, the followers are in a small room, fearing for their
safety and all, and they say to Jesus "how is anyone going to
believe all this stuff" (or words to that effect), and Jesus replies
"because you are my witnesses.  Tell them and they will believe".

I'm so disgusted by the other disinformation put out by John's loyal
friends (i.e. "respected" cypherpunks) on the subject of "disrupters
and sociopaths", etc. that I try not to reply to any of the crud I
see posted by those clowns.  But when someone tries to be reasonable,
conversation is possible.  So how about some points on "disrupters":
1. Disrupters don't like bullies.
2. Disrupters don't like mindless authorities.
3. Disrupters don't like control freaks.
4. Disrupters don't like liars and hypocrites.
5. Disrupters don't like NSA/CIA/DEA/FBI trolls.
6. Disrupters don't like Animal Farm policies and elitists.
In short, if Gilmore had come down on the real problem people once
in a while, they wouldn't have agitated the "disrupters" nearly as
much as they did.  But he wasn't about to do that, because he's one
of the problem people himself.  Fooey on you, Gilmore.  May you never

I love working with girls, regardless of the job. I personally prefer
the ones who don't suck up to "the guys", and who don't subscribe to
what society prefers girls should do or look like.  Unfortunately,
most offices won't hire them unless they conform in ways that I feel
are offensive, so the really independent ones wind up mainly in low-
paying jobs or going it alone (i.e., driving a truck).
Nothing wrong with driving a truck, of course, but it would be nicer

"Out of control" says it all, don't you think?  (as in "control
freaks", that is).
No, it decreases rapidly when your forum more-or-less suddenly
becomes a hot item on the web.  If it weren't hot, nobody would
bother, believe me.
"Scale" is a term used by controllers.
Look at the big picture.  Some people have proposed unacceptable
methods for controlling human population, and it should be no
surprise that the same mentality would pervade these forums.
Unless, of course, the forum itself (and its proponents) are
themselves the "agent provocateurs".
Loyalty?  Amongst anarchists?  Two points: Loyalty on c-punks was
almost entirely a negative factor (i.e., sucking up to Gilmore).
Two, Tim May is for Tim May (as he should be), and he didn't abandon
his ideals one bit, which is a helluva lot more to say for him than
Gilmore or Sandfort.

Not the same thing at all.  Any posts he may have made about any
list topic (whether "on-topic" or not) I did not jump on him for.
I have made specific comments disagreeing with people about factual
or theoretical particulars, or I've made disparaging comments about
list "leaders" using their "reputation capital" to shove other people
out of their way like bullies, but I haven't taken to calling
ordinary list subscribers names because I think they're paranoid
(which I'm really not, though I'm a "professional" conspiratologist),
or because I otherwise disagree with them.
I looked at one archive the other day, and it contained 850+ messages
by me posted to cypherpunks between approximately 1 Sep 96 and late
Jan 97.  I think you'll find them very consistent, and although I
could be accused of harboring my own arrogance in some areas, I can
handle any criticism you put forth, since you (for example) don't
slander me gratuitously or viciously.
Several months ago, I made a post where I said that approx. 95% of
people stay within the confines of their parents' religion for life,
meaning that while they may change denominations, or split different
hairs on various dogmas, they still remain Catholic if their parents
were Catholic, etc.  One of the list "leaders" chose to say I didn't
know what I was talking about, even though I very well did know what
I was talking about (and I told him so), so he replied that he didn't
want me putting his email address in any of my posts (i.e., don't
hit the reply-to-all button unless I manually delete his name), and
has steadfastly ignored me ever since.  I don't mind being ignored,
in fact, it gives me time to do better things than argue with persons
who don't really listen, but what pisses me off is this bully-like
arrogance on the part of some of the clique who would really like to
get rid of people like me, but can't recommend it since it would

The only "software" I have newer than 1989 is Win95 and Netscape.
I only run these on one computer, to make net and email access easier.
My other computers run straight MS-DOS.  I had UNIX in 1986 on a
portable HP computer, but HP dropped support for it (what else is new).
If I had the time to do it, and I could get a concise written spec of
how to interface with whatever I need to, I'd write my own O/S and
datacomm software. So I make compromises where necessary for expediency.
PGP to me is not necessary (I can encrypt without it), but I do recognize

Looks like we're coming to the old "irresistable force meets immovable
object" consensus, yes?
The sheeple are going to plod along slowly and resistantly towards
personal, "secure" encryption,
while the rulers would rather eat their children than give up money.
My guess is that the public (see: sheeple) is *never* going to become
technically oriented, no matter how many gizmos or crypto programs they
have and can use. Therefore, the rulers, possessing ever greater numbers
and quality of intrusive devices, will inch forward toward total control,
despite temporary advances by the sheeple.
The (perfect) example of the 1960's revolution was vastly outweighed by:
1. Decapitation of any independent leadership, i.e., assassinations.
2. Co-opting of schools, businesses, media, welfare programs et al.
3. Tremendous advances in disinformation and propaganda technology
   which has no analogy amongst the general public.
Some people think the Internet will help the average guy win back some
freedom, but the reality is that capital is still being shifted away
from the common folk to the wealthier folk, even as the Internet expands.
The sheeple have had one (unintended) weapon on their side:  The fact
that the scumbag fed agencies and their beneficiaries have been fighting
amongst themselves a lot (see: assassinations). This will instantly stop
if the sheeple become a real threat.  You won't believe how fast.
It's the dream of every elitist that they will someday be able to enjoy
a really comfortable and yet productive existence, where the non-elite
are satisfied and happy with their jobs (or are somehow being supported
without unduly burdening the elitists), and most important, are just
comfortable enough that they won't riot (or at least won't riot in the
elitist neighborhoods).  Most likely the electronic implants and drugs
(Soma, HDTV/3DTV) will alleviate most of the sheeple's unhappiness, so
as to reduce the requirement for the elitists to give any more attention
to these problems.

C'mon Gary, why would anyone want to bother with all of this crap?
Chip implants are already in millions of pets.  It's simple, cheap,
and there's no work for the owner.
Thousands of humans are also implanted, i.e., Green Berets, Seals, and
similar types, women with breast implants, and so on.  There's a move-
ment on to implant most children, so they're not as vulnerable to kid-
napping, etc.
I realize most people are still afraid of the 666 stuff (direct evidence
from the phone company shows most people will not accept  with 666
prefixes), but they'll get over it when they see the benefits, and how
it frees up their time so they can watch more TV or play on the Internet.

the U.S. is much more cosmopolitan now.
Nonetheless, it's interesting how much of the FUD from conservative
Christianity (to name an example I'm familiar with) still has a strong

1. Dale Thorn is very similar to Damien Thorn.

   this can be the equivalent of 666 for a Basic programmer, taking
   one digit at a time.
3. If you sign (with a pen) the name quickly, using counterclockwise

Not my point. My point is, you make sure the chips are deep enough that
they can't be removed without removing a great deal of body mass (and
probably killing the subject).  The chip also has to be monitorable
externally, so that a number of transponders or whatever positioned in
many different places can isolate each chip and ID it, much like police
do with auto licence plates.
This way, it's vastly more difficult (or impossible) to operate the
so-called white-slave rings now sponsored by various elitist groups

Fear?  What fear?  I had a long and productive life before I subscribed
here, and what with 1,000 or so programming projects awaiting me (and
most other competent programmers), I certainly won't be wasting time
bemoaning the fact that Sandy Sandfort "won" here, any more than I
bemoan the fact that most wars anywhere are won by the bad guys.
I'll tell you something else. If I have an opportunity to contribute to
a project that can fight censorship of this kind, I will do so eagerly.
OTOH, I have no "tentacles", nor will I ever have such things.  I am not
a communications, security, O/S, or other such kind of programmer/person,
and I will not get into those types of applications short of physically
saving my life.  In other words, if Sandfort/Gilmore cuts me off in the
long run, it's doubtful you'd hear from me again unless something is
forwarded from Freedom-Knights, and even that is doubtful.
One would think you would understand the principle of using examples
to illustrate a point. The very idea that those names would automatic-
ally inspire fear is amusing.
Having read a lot of the crap put out by organizations from the KKK to
the ADL (all scumbags BTW), I no longer take the naive position that a
person is "liberal" (hence, one-dimensional) or "conservative", or any
other convenient tag.  Some people are liars, hypocrites, and assholes,
though, and I prefer to determine that by their actions rather than
their speculations.
You mean I don't tailor my prose to what people want to hear?
Better yet, I don't go somewhere else where maybe I would be more
welcome with my ideas?  I'm embarrassed for you, for your lack of
imagination.  And if the "snake oil" tag refers to my ideas on
crypto software (i.e., PGP), well, you have a long way to go
before you provide a serious mental challenge to me.

This is cool.  I get to respond to a literate question.  How unusual.
1. Sandfort is the person who would never drop an argument, no matter
   how long, until he had the last word.  I know since I went rounds
   with him a time or two.  As far as I can tell (not being a profess-
   ional psychologist), Sandy has some emotional limitations that would
   make him a poor choice to moderate such an intense list as this.
   Certainly the moderated list would still be quite intense, since
   the intent is to be a political/social forum. Sandfort unfortunately
   appears to be a special friend of Gilmore's, and I don't think John
   has taken the time to consider the outcome.
2. The only possible scheme that could work long-term would be a moderated
   list plus a deleted (excised?) list of posts which didn't make the
   moderator's cut. Having a moderated list and a full unmoderated list
   is certain to fail, and I'm not too sure that they don't have this in
   mind already.
3. Not making the unmoderated list first-up (i.e., cutting posts first,
   then making the "full" list available later) is suspicious, or at
   least a bad idea.
4. Moving everyone to the moderated list and then having people who want
   the full list unsubscribe and resubscribe is more evidence of bad
   faith.  If what Sandy says is true (I don't believe it), the vast
   majority of posts (excluding obvious spam, probably 75 or more a day)
   will be in the moderated list, therefore I think anyone can see that
   merely cutting the spam and bad flames is not the ultimate intent.
   To do that, all they would have had to do is announce a bucket where
   they're dropping the excisions, and let whoever wants them to pick
   them up from there. Maybe they thought that would make them look bad,
   but before this is over (if they continue on their present course),
   they're going to look much worse.
I just can't believe Gilmore wants to have Sandfort do this.  There's
gotta be someone he can trust who has a viable reputation.  Then again,
who with a decent reputation would want to moderate cypherpunks?
BTW, thanks for the literate reply.

Unless the reversal of gain/loss in the 5th data row is permanent,
c-punks are losing 0.8 bodies per day, or 294 subscribers per year.
Actually, the constant high turnover suggests something else:
Many people join the list and get back off again due to the high
volume and their own personal time constraints.  Unless Sandy can
cut *way* back on the number of posts to the list, i.e. excise a *lot*
more postings than just the blatant Spam and "Timmy is a....." posts,
it won't make any difference to those people who come and go.
In effect, Sandy is going to have to cut the number of daily posts
(to the moderated list) from, say, 100 per day down to, say, 20 or
25 per day.  This would certainly be a goal of his, since most of the
subscriber comments I've heard indicate that even 50 posts per day of
"relevant political/social commentary" is way too high for them.
As to the net loss in subscribers, the moderation of the list could
have a substantial effect on the number of subscribers short-term,
but whatever trend we have here will continue regardless, since the
real value and character of the list is not determined by the posts
which are removed (unless it were that some of the character and value
is going to be removed), but by long-term factors which are to be
expected when the principals get older, less involved, and less
contentious (like Sandy, wanting to avoid conflict).

So leave, anyway.  When I lived in the Deep South for several years,
during which time I learned some things about the South that were
seriously distorted in the propaganda you get in the North, I began
to cringe every time some Yankee would come down there and say things
like "Ya' know, I don't like the way you people do this or that, or the
way you talk, or the way you exclude outsiders, ....".  Same principle
applies here.  Somebody's always wanting to change things, they say
it's "for the better".  Bullcrap.  I'd like to say you'll find out if
you stick around long enough, but the traffic is rather heavy here,
and I have things to do....
The big-time spam problem should be addressed as a technical issue,
not as a censorship issue.  There are many good ideas, and frankly,
if the spammers got *really* serious, hand-editing would *not* work
no matter how hard they tried.  As far as the "Timmy is a..." posts
go, I would *not* want someone hand-censoring or editing these posts
just to remove those annoyances.  I'll bet you can find plenty of
people on cypherpunks who would rather have myself and a handful of
other "pests" removed than worry about the relatively small number
of "Timmy is...." posts. You're not gonna make everyone happy, period.

Of course, I hope I'm wrong, or that there's some technology or

I am sympathetic to what you're saying.  I am also sympathetic to the
opinion that there are some things that people practice which are OK
if they affect only them and nobody else, but are not necessarily OK
when they affect others.  One of the things that make a society a
society is the relative accomodation or tolerance that society has
for various practices and beliefs which are outside of the norm.
The PC premise is that it's OK to have certain practices and beliefs
which are outside (sometimes way outside) of the norm, but that to keep
from hurting the feelings of what are (or in the PC people's opinion
should be) protected classes of people/practices/beliefs, we should
refrain from speech or actions which has the effect of offending
these people.
You'll note in the last presidential campaign, to name an example, much
of the media beat up on Pat Buchanan, going so far as to call him a Nazi

whatever, did they speak out against this public labeling of Buchanan?
I don't know a damn thing about the real Buchanan, although I know that
William F. Buckley Jr. is a real scumbag, to name a relevant example.
I'm sorry if I don't conform 100%, but I just don't see any real justice
being called for and worked for by the PC mob - I only see selfishness
and an ongoing attempt to transfer more power from the mainstream public
into the hands of various special interest groups.
Tell you what, though.  If any gay interest group comes out for justice
in a substantial way, that is, if they call for changes I can believe in,
I'll support them to that extent at least, and try to stay out of their

Now, I've stated this on the list before, but nobody's reading us, so
it won't matter if I repeat it [hee hee].  John has the full attention
of the FBI, CIA, and several other such orgs (any disputing that?).
Those guys are about as likely to allow John to do whatever John wants
as they are likely to allow you and I to run our own currency exchange
in Barbados, unhampered by them.
This cuts both ways:  If Gilmore kept the list open, the feds can sit
on their butts and troll to their hearts' content.  One presumes the
list is a good source of names and info, even if some of the names are
just connections to other leads, in other areas of business even.
If Gilmore wrecks the list, it has the very distinct possibility of
discouraging a *successful* replacement list for some time to come,
perhaps forever.  Think about how successful the assassination business
was for the feds for some time - today they get patsys and hide them

   mobile phone is from the scanner (on average), the fainter the
   mobile person's voice is going to be, and it is often virtually
   inaudible. There are two 25-mhz cellular ranges, upper and lower,
   and I think 2600 or 411 mag. has detailed which carries what
   info.  Someone with a scanner may be tuning in the upper range
   when they really want the lower, or vice-versa.

You're the heat.  You've been watching Bo and Jo, driving around at
night tuning in to the security cars who watch all the nice houses in
Brentwood.  You wanna nail these guys, since you know they pass on the
info (who's away, and where) they scanned to professional burglers.
So you get some evidence that they've been scanning security or
whatever, and you bust 'em.  How to present the evidence?  I don't
think it matters much after O.J.  Matter of fact, if the plaintiffs
win the civil trial, it should be a major boost for presenting bogus
and sloppy evidence like the Bo and Jo example.  Cross your fingers.

They're not gonna toss the law out, since the law doesn't really deal
with thought crimes, i.e., hearing something you're not supposed to
hear. The law allows them to prosecute people who deliberately monitor
to collect information which can be used against the people being
monitored, or to take advantage of them (steal trade secrets, etc.).
There's a presumption that the person about to be prosecuted has a
collection of information somewhere (on paper, on disk....) that they
otherwise could not possibly have gotten legally.
I've listened to judges describe something similar, in person - the
use of mailing lists by former employees, usually salespeople, where
the names/addresses and other info on the list might be proprietary.
Lawyers for scumbags love to sue over this one, since it's harder for
a judge to declare bad faith or a frivolous suit against the plaintiff
when the issue is unfair competition instigated by "theft" of a mailing
list.  The rule comes down to whether the info is generally available
legally, or whether it absolutely had to have been gotten illegally.

Scanner manufacturers have been getting around a lot of this by putting
ever more of the scanner's intelligence on EEPROM or flash chips, and
providing a computer interface to the scanner.
Software to do the rest can be gotten thru the web, or thru addresses
in 2600 or 411 magazine. I'm getting anxious to get a new scanner that
can follow the cellular hopping, ditto for police using the new trunked
systems that also hop frequencies, ditto for decoding digital, and for
decoding other common scrambling like the crap that Motorola puts out.

This is exactly the reason the jerks (Gilmore, Sandfort) CHANGED THE

This is one of the oldest and most well-used national security tricks

allow people to attack others, then cut the responses.
If he does this, and he doesn't rectify it when it's called to his
attention, he would need to be punished in some way.  One of the
questions I have is, how do I know what's cut when all I subscribe to
is the uncensored list?  I do *not* want to subscribe to the filtered
list plus the "flames" list, out of principle.  Is this something that
would be forced on me/us in order to monitor the censorship?

All this assumes that Sandfort and Gilmore are real, sincere, and
somewhat honest people.  Which of course is not at all the case.
There is an agenda here, it has a hidden money trail, and the dis-
information put out as to the "real" purpose of the moderation should

"Cypherpunks" who assume Sandfort is doing this out of the goodness

Do we now have to have occasional assurances that the "unedited" list
is not being restrained?  I thought that was a given, beyond question
of any kind.  I thought *all* of the controversy revolved around the
edited/censored list (having stole the original list's name), and that
everyone understood that the uncensored list was untouchable.  But now

I've gotten several confirmations on this, and no negatives, so....
What I remember is that Hart and Schweiker were on one of the intel
committees in the early 1970's, working more-or-less side by side with
Frank Church et al, uncovering the real dirty laundry of the CIA and
its infiltration of nearly every college and important business and
media in the USA.  Hart's minor spillage to the press must have pissed
someone off, so they got the famous picture with Rice in all the papers,
and Hart's presidential bid went right down the toilet.

Your/Gilmore's *renaming* of the original list, and co-opting of the
*original* name for the edited list is prima facie evidence of bad
faith, i.e., a transparent attempt to fool the public into accepting
that the edited list is the *real, original* list, despite the dis-
claimer put forth in the introduction to the new plan (a paragraph
that few will read, and much fewer will remember).
I'll make you a deal, even though I hold no *real* cards.  Set the
original name back to the original, unedited list, and vice-versa,
and I'll back off of all these complaints, assuming that you don't
try something else that impinges on the integrity of the original list.
As far as hidden agendas go, the flip side of that coin is that I'm
expected to believe that Gilmore is the Mother Teresa of the Internet,
or something like that.  Personally, I don't care what scam you or he
could possibly (hypothetically) be involved in, as long as it doesn't
impinge on certain essential liberties and truths, in a way that
offends me.  If you insist that what you and he are doing is totally
non-profit, has nothing to do with government grants or spying, etc.,
and is purely a personal hobby-type pursuit, well, I don't really
believe in the Easter Bunny, and please forgive me for not believing
this one.  Note that I'm not attacking you purely because I'm alleging
(hypothetically) that you have an ulterior motive for the work you're
doing on cypherpunks, I'm merely pointing out reasonable speculations

Somebody correct me if I'm wrong.  We already get the censored stuff
on the alleged-to-be "unedited" list, so by looking at the censored

The idea that "sin" and "evil" are abstract and somewhat arbitrary is
merely a human (and therefore faulty) perception.
If God can be perfect by definition (for sake of argument), then "sin"
is taking one's attention from God's intent and turning to man's intent,
which is inherently selfish.  "Evil" is the selfish thing you do, when
you should do the unselfish thing.

The list only suffers when you guys stop posting crypto/political
info.  For example, if tomorrow there are 100 new posts, and 10 of
them are crypto/political relevant, and 10 more are like this one
(I'm ignoring the other 80 for this example), then the list is only
10% relevant.  Take away these 10, and it's 11.1%, but 10 less posts
to read.  Turn these 10 into something relevant, and voila(!), the
list is now 20% relevant.

Most of the erstwhile elite types do the ordinary things in a quite
ordinary way.  Get dressed, eat, collect and send e-mail, and so on.
The un-ordinary things (for example) are the thought processes which
take place while typing out a post.  Those thought processes don't
generally intersect directly with the mundane things such as operating
the computer, unless the operations themselves are unusual and demand
the full attention of the person involved.

I have a CD today (used to be an LP in the late 1970's) of Enrico
Caruso arias, digitally processed thru something called Stockham/
Soundstream digital process, circa mid-late 1970's.
They took a number of samples of a modern (1970's) tenor's singing
(someone whose voice had similar characteristics to Caruso's) and had
the computer run it against the original Caruso recordings in an
attempt to subtract out extraneous noise, resonances, and so on.
The process helped somewhat, making the voice seem closer intead of
somewhere a couple of rooms over, but the essential quality of the
mechanically-recorded sound was still there, i.e., very dull and not
at all life-like.
They were supposed to release a lot more of this stuff, and they did
some, but major interest was never there, and I haven't heard any more
about further research in the intervening years, although I'll bet it's
gone way beyond where it was.

it followed that they would notice certain administrative messages more
than non-elite people, and also remember those messages better.
I had no contention with the remember-better part, assuming that was
stated somewhere, but my argument is that greater intelligence does
not necessarily lead to paying better attention to mundane everyday
things like administrative messages and notices. The specific example
was whether most cypherpunks subscribers would take more than momentary
notice of the new list arrangements, and whether they would consciously
think about whether they should change their status (subscription), and
if so, why.  My contention is that most would not give it any serious
amount of attention.  This is no different IMO than whether erstwhile
"intelligent" people pay greater attention to road signs while driving

I could agree with "some of the points" of the Ebonics program were
it not for the fact of the hidden points.  Unbeknownst to most folks,
supporting a program on any erstwhile points will give support to the
program on *all* points.
One specific example:
When I worked for Firestone corporate from 1970 to 1981, we were
bullied into giving to the United Fund. (BTW, I learned how much
my boss was making by reading the punches on the IBM cards.) The one
bone they tossed us was we could specify which worthy causes our
personal contribution would go towards.  The trick was, if a certain
greater-than-expected number of people specified a Catholic charity,
for example, more funds would then be moved into the other charities
to balance that out.  Presumably those funds would come from those
folks who hadn't declared a designee.
In my view, once the contributors' specific designations were made,
the remaining undesignated contributions should have been split
across the designees according to the original percentages declared
in the U.F. literature.  Anything else would be a farce.

My point about the antibiotics is that the male gays take a dis-
proportionate amount of them, which compounds their problems.  It
suggests to me that the immune system is already seriously debilitated
or damaged before AIDS can take hold, rather than the notion that a
healthy person can get it from the virii alone.
One could argue that in the cases where the cures (antibiotics) add to
a person's problems by further corrupting their immune system, that
they should simply change their habits.  Since I don't see that as a
reasonable possibility, the only thing left is that the public should
be made aware of *all* of the relevant facts, even those which are

I'm not precisely sure, but remember, I'm not saying that your typical
suburban, well-to-do, successful gay male falls into this category.
There are, OTOH, a lot of people in the city who have lifestyles which
are not represented accurately in the prime-time sitcoms, and the ones
who fall into the greatest health-risk category are IV drug users and
gay males (in the city, remember - i.e., Santa Monica boulevard).
Remember too those ads for male sexual lubricants - you cannot use
a condom with those lubricants.  Safe sex, I don't think so.
You're kidding, yes?  Anything besides good food, exercise, sleep etc.
is bad for the immune system.  Antibiotics (usually "dead" germs of
some sort) are horrendous things to inject directly into your system.
In October 1959, after lapsing into a coma from a massive sinus
infection, I was given "a million units of penicillin" in the
children's hospital when first admitted.  I recovered OK after
two weeks, so I'm certainly not opposed to antibiotics for those
who really need them.  OTOH, our U.S. economy today is antibiotic-
and-hormone crazy, injecting cows, pigs, and chickens to name a few
animals, all in the hopes of raising production.  So why is the rate
of cancer going up so high?  It seems nearly everyone I know is
getting this degenerate disease when they get older.  Check out the
videos by Howard Lyman, who used to be a big-time "chemical" farmer.

Let's be realistic about how AIDS is acquired.  A small analogy:
In my pockets I carry two wallets, one with $100's and the other with
smaller change, about 50 bills in various small denominations.  Let's
say tomorrow I spend a $10 bill at the bookstore, and the guy behind
the counter says "this is a phony bill".  So where did I get it?
Well, if pocket change were always LIFO (last in, first out), I might
be able to remember, but there's a good chance I wouldn't, since I go
to a lot of places and do a lot of small transactions.
Now I'm only talking 50 or so small bills, acquired and redistributed
over a period of at most a few months.  AIDS, OTOH, is likely to be
a development from years of  1) Contact with germs, chemicals, food
additives, antibiotics other medical treatments, sexual contact, etc.
and 2) Immune-suppressing activities such as lack of sleep and exercise,
anxiety and stress, and so on.
It seems to me that "proof" of someone acquiring AIDS from one stab
with a contaminated needle is a very nebulous thing. As far as nurses
go, the contact I've had with many of them tells me they are also
(on average) drug users extraordinaire.  Again, you'll be able to
find a very clean hospital in a big city with a bunch of nice clean
nurses in it (a lot of sweet old ladies is the image coming to mind),

The virus I believe is best explained by the numerous articles that
were published in the 1970's on "gene splicing", and the fact that we
now have two certified (official) government requests on paper that
call for the development of an agent precisely like HIV, which were
in fact funded.  One was requested in 1979 (I think) by someone
representing the Ft. Detrick folks ($10 million), and the other
request was formally made by the World Health Organization.  Why
would the WHO want to develop a nasty bug like HIV?  Use your
imagination.  Does the virus actually cause the immune collapse?
That's still controversial, from what I hear.  Try to find some of
the material by Jakob Segal, who is heavily suppressed in the USA.
Also check out Jon Rappaport (who also did some excellent on-the-spot
interviews in OKC after the bombing), also Dr. Robert Strecker, whose
brother was murdered trying to investigate the political threads of
the origins of AIDS/HIV.
True if all other things are equal.  Try subtracting out some of the
cancer factors, and perhaps they'd die of something else.
Try an interesting experiment. Get an ordinary hamburger at McDonald's.
Take the "meat" out of the bun and break it in half, then hold the
broken edge up to your nose.  It helps to have good sense of smell,
but you'll probably get the picture anyway.

I wish this were true, at least of nations which would be friendly
to someone like me (white, Western, etc.).  A bully on a school
playground can always be knocked down, no matter how big or how
vicious he is.  Sadly, the U.S. bully cannot be knocked down.  Bad
enough you get nuclear, chemical, and/or biological stuff waved at
you - if you get into a hot war like Desert Storm, your country is
carpet-bombed with fleets of B-52's until it is thoroughly debilitated.
How does one country get on top and terrorize the whole world?  By
following Tom Wolfe's intimation concerning the pirates: "The people
on the East coast were constantly victimized because they couldn't
comprehend just how vicious and ruthless the pirates really were"

People who read this might argue that the "true power" is international

I wish this were true, at least of nations which would be friendly
to someone like me (white, Western, etc.).  A bully on a school
playground can always be knocked down, no matter how big or how
vicious he is.  Sadly, the U.S. bully cannot be knocked down.  Bad
enough you get nuclear, chemical, and/or biological stuff waved at
you - if you get into a hot war like Desert Storm, your country is
carpet-bombed with fleets of B-52's until it is thoroughly debilitated.
How does one country get on top and terrorize the whole world?  By
following Tom Wolfe's intimation concerning the pirates: "The people
on the East coast were constantly victimized because they couldn't
comprehend just how vicious and ruthless the pirates really were"
(quote approximate).
People who read this might argue that the "true power" is international
now, and not confined to the USA.  I say it doesn't matter which end
you look at it from, the "true power" has been concentrating and
centralizing itself for some years now, and you can use any nation-label
you like.

The real babes in So. Cal. go to tanning salons. That way the evenly-

There are two really major beaches in the L.A. area that I know of.
One is Bolsa Chica, several miles long, north of Huntington Beach,
which attracts most of the young'uns south of L.A., and Zuma in the
northmost points of Malibu, which gets a lot of Valley people
(fer sure).  To quote the L.A. Weekly of a few years ago, in a
"Best of L.A." review, "Why do all those hot young girls go to Zuma?
Because that's where all the hot young boys are."
But the real babes don't go there.  They get skates and nifty little
costumes and zip up and down the boardwalks in Santa Monica and
Pacific Palisades mostly, in case some hot producer/director should
happen along.

When I recall my growing up years and the political/social arguments
I participated in, I can hardly believe the things I've learned since,
esp. things like government agencies sharing asset forfeitures as a
means of funding further seizures (kind of snowballs, if you know
what I mean).  Check out H.R. 3355 of late 1993, which authorizes
Janet Reno to personally treaty up with the local cops in every U.S.
city of 100,000 pop. or more, i.e., most of the U.S. population,
and virtually all of the "crime".
There was a previous post today, perhaps yours, which made the point
that while erstwhile freedom fighters are trying to put out one fire
or another, the govt. boys are lighting dozens more.  I guess that
means we'll have to pony up a lot more tax money to pay those guys.
Whoops!  I forgot - they can self-fund now with the asset seizures.

Lived all over So. Cal. for 12 years, 4 years in SE Tenn., close to
Atlanta.  Atlanta has some nice babes, warm weather.  I fell totally
in love with a girl from Chattanooga, who was probably the best college
radio D.J. who ever lived.  Lived in Charleston for a short while.
Much smaller than Atlanta.  Very cozy.  Spent a lot of time in
Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Detroit. The best babes there are usually the
Chrissy Hynde (Akron) types.  Spent 2-1/2 years in Southern Germany.
Very, very nice.  Loved Berchtesgaden (sp?).  Interestingly enough,
I have a fondness for English girls.  Must be the ancestry thing.
I'd really like to talk to some Welsh girls - my mum's grandparents
came to the U.S. from there.  What about you?

I have a great deal of respect for power.  When I was 6, I unwound a
coat hanger and put both ends into an electrical outlet.  All I
remember from that is something like a sledgehammer hitting me, and
I went backwards rather quickly.  And I never did it again.
But seriously, I was just telling the folks over the weekend, if I
had my hand on the button, a lot of people would die very quickly.
As in The Day The Earth Stood Still, a single act of aggression would
suffice to be immediately terminated.  The best place to begin, in
the USA at least, would be the public freeways.  There you have the
most acts of aggression in a short space, and the best pickings for
liquidation.  Give me the power, and I'll show you all those nifty
techno-ways of eliminating people that have been kept from the public
by our benevolent government ("sources and methods").
BTW, I don't give a damn about someone "cutting me off", since I'm
not aggressive enough (outside of my liquidation duties) to be bothered
by that in most cases.  I'm primarily concerned with vehicles who get
too close behind, who pass with no safety margin, etc.  I call these
people anal-compulsive (as opposed to anal-retentive).  You've seen
the videos on PBS, the various animal species whose male members
perform occasional "mounting" of others to intimidate.  There are a
large percentage of humans who try to do the same thing, demonstrating
that they (IMO) have no further need of their lives.

Good question.  The law we have right now already assumes that there
are situations where a criminal will not go peacefully, if at all.
In some countries (years ago?) such as England, bobbies were known
to not carry firearms for ordinary street duty.  Am I right?  But
here in the USA, that would be unthinkable.
So my proposal doesn't eliminate the responsibility portion of law
enforcement.  I'd say, if a target were eliminated thru negligence,
malfeasance, or other wrongdoing under "color of law" or whatever,
let the courts handle that as they do now.
My suggestion would give the law enforcers the ability to dispense
the first level of justice expeditiously, which they cannot accomplish
now due to all of the red tape and the corrupt legal system (lawyers
specialize in getting chronic offenders off, particularly "traffic"
offenses).  By transferring a major portion of the bureaucracy to
the pencil pushers, we can free up the street cops to do what they
do best, namely bust or eliminate criminals.
I dare say that the downside of this is much less pleasant than the
virtual anarchy (in the bad sense) we suffer now.  If the police get
out of control, A.P. will arrive just in time to plug a few of those
holes, so to speak.  Ideally, future robotics should be able to
provide something like Gort (sp?) to take the place of human officers,
given advances in the kind of pattern matching needed to deter
aggression and the like.  Those who don't make it past the robots,
well, the rest of us can learn to behave, and we'll be much better
off when we do.

I used Altadena as a generic example of a suburb, although Camarillo
would be even better, since it's not so cosmopolitan as most of the

inner city, for a lot of reasons.  I love the place, dirt and all.
BTW, I was *not* referring to walking around, I was comparing driving,
mainly on the freeway.  Statistics have come out in major papers that
back my experience up 100%.  I drive from P.C.H. @ Seal Beach Blvd.
to the Ventura County beach area every weekend, and back again.  I
used to go down the 101 to the 405, then south on the 405 to Seal
Beach Blvd.  Nowadays I take the 101 all the way into town to the 5,
down the 5 to the 605, and down the 605 to 7th Street in Long Beach.
It's 3 miles further thru town, and 20 minutes slower on average,
but I get only about one psycho per 20 round trips now, as compared
to at least one per trip on the 101-405 combo when I went that way.
The difference was striking, and I can only surmise that rednecks and
their ilk are more fearful of attacking other people in the inner city
as opposed to the outlying regions.

All true.  But I'm not suggesting the creation of anything new here.
Cops already carry guns and kill people.  All I'm suggesting is that
they be empowered to kill when:
1) The crime is aggression against another person or persons;
2) The evidence is so solid (recorded?) that the officer (who risks
   being prosecuted if he kills unjustifiably) can carry out the
   enforcement without undue apprehension;
3) These things are reviewed by the elected representatives of the
   people, to make sure there's no hanky-panky going on.

Actually, the computer you type on will be very easy to pick out
of the noise field with modest spy equipment sitting down the street.
There's a company (I lost the brochure) who sell EM attenuator
material, some preconfigured, and presumably some bulk.  It should
be easy to find on the Web.  Once you get some really dramatic
attenuation, particularly of the keyboard (and particularly during
password confirmations, etc.), you should do your own preliminary
monitoring with some of those band-sweep gadgets.  Steady noise
of course is nothing compared to the spikes from some of the keyboard
Once you've identified all (we can hope, can't we) of the problem
signals still leaking through the shielding (albeit at greatly
reduced levels), you can direct different kinds of efforts there,
including random noise from other computers which use the exact
same output devices.
HP has been selling Tempest-approved PC's since the early 1980's
(if not before), and at not too steep a price, either, so it can't
be all that difficult, once you get a handle on it.

I'd argue that the worst thing was probably television, since now
people don't go outdoors a lot and talk to their neighbors like
they used to.  Today, in most cities, you don't even know the
neighbors unless they blocked your parking space.
There are tradeoffs between the old and new - in the old society,
say, the USA circa late 1800's to early 1900's, we were much more
violent.  The big stir about shooting 4 students at Kent State
would be severly dwarfed by the mass killing of 1200 in one day
in New York city in the anti-draft riots of the mid-1860's, and
the bombings of the MOVE neighborhood in Philly circa 1985 and
WACO circa 1993 would be insignificant compared to what happened
to the American Indians.
Personal (non-government) violence was rampant long ago - men and
women as parents routinely called up the Bible verse "spare the rod
and spoil the child" to beat the living crap out of their kids.
Persons who were grown up in the 1940's and 1950's will recall the
days when parents would beat their kids in public when "necessary",
and when at home, beat kids so badly that you could hear the scream-
ing a block away.  Don't even ask about the violence against women.
This is only one example of the horrors of living in the "good old
days" - if necessary, I could catalogue some other examples.

Today we have to be much more subtle to drag the kids off to kill
and die, hence the Ken Burns-style poster at the U.S. Post Offices
which says "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do", i.e., one of
the first lessons in logic courses is the unspoken lie in the quote.
In the old days, they didn't have to be so subtle - they could call
up all manner of demonic images of the enemy, or claim that God had
called them to slay the infidels, which was rampant as late as the
"Civil" War circa 1865.  There's a song "The Battle Hymn Of The
Republic", which was crafted to crank up the emotion to kill the
Southerners.  (It never occurred to king schmucko Ken Burns that
slavery wasn't against the law until 1863).
It actually surprises me (how naive, you say) that they could get
away with the Incubator Baby Scam in Congress circa 1991.  Funny
thing is, one of my young charges visited the Museum Of Tolerance
in Los Angeles recently, and there was an eerily similar account
of Hitler's men throwing Jewish babies out of the hospitals....
Women would disappear for weeks at a time, from time to time,
generally to fix some "female problem" at the hospital (no need
for the kids to visit, better to have fun visiting aunts and uncles,
or have a nanny over for a couple of weeks) until the "problem"
was taken care of.
If you could allow me to use the freeways as a model for potential
violence, when there is a very stressful situation at hand, and
people are allowed to do things that they would never do outside
of the confines (and protection) of their cars, it is this:
At home in the old days, with a wife and several kids (families
were mostly larger then), you often had a boiling bot for stress,
and the (effectively) legal act of beating one's wife severely
would be covered up by the "family, friends, neighbors, and church".
Especially the church, the good old Christian church (my experience)
where God is a terrible God and the punishment for even raising an
eyebrow to His Agent on Earth (daddy) might be a body damaged for
life in some way.  The power and the temptations inherent in the
sovereignty of a man's home were too much for most people to
manage honestly and fairly, hence the heavy reliance on Bible
verses to cover up/justify the excesses.
This BTW is one of my most important reasons to distrust Libertarians
and other Right-Wingers, i.e., the sovereignty of the home principle.
It cuts both ways, you see...

I inherited three kids (9, 11, and 13) in November, and am starting
to get used to the schools' intrusions just now.  So far, I've
prepared one form for the kids to hand to the teacher when there
is an off-campus trip scheduled.  Like who's driving, are they
certified by the school board, chaperones (who are they), etc.
Recently they did a surprise dental inspection of the youngest kid.
I'm preparing a form to tell the schools that any certification they
require on the kids as to health, etc. will be provided by our
doctors, not theirs, so the kids can skip their inspections.
So far I haven't met with any serious opposition, but who knows?
(I'm informing them that I'm a Puritan, and follow very strict
religious practices)
Today's Long Beach paper had an extensive article on "pregnancy
counciling support groups" for sixth grade girls (in Santa Ana?),
and the "support groups" were mandatory. Religious fundamentalists
are certain to hit the ceiling on this one - not just the increase
in sexual awareness aspect, but the hoodoo-voodoo aspect of a
"support" group that smacks of New Age practices (their article,
not mine).  According to the article, the groups have an amazing
record, i.e., pregnancies down by 80% or more among the teenage girls.

As a person who was once a child in a very unhappy home (5 kids,
nobody talks to anyone else), I can testify that I would have been
willing at several points to take a chance with the State.
Would it have helped or hurt more?  I believe that would have depended
on knowing how much worse things would have gotten at home (some
homes get worse, some get better, some stay the same), and just how
bad it would have been under the State.  I think those are the issues,
but how are you gonna predict which is worse, unless you have some
real incriminating evidence against the parents?
On a related note, there's a valid point about the State raising
kids being not only unnatural, but leading to bad things preparing
the kids for a future statist society.  Just another factor as far
as I'm concerned, when the life and safety of a defenseless child
is in question.

Good points all.  I'd add that since society and standards are
evolving, and the state's negative influences are gaining along
with the positive ones, a goal of keeping the state at bay is a
good one to pursue.  One issue that concerns me, though, is the
kids' access to their own redresses. There was the kid who "divorced"
his parents, and probably other examples where kids have brought
third parties (other than government) between them and their parents.
I think this sort of thing has merit in some cases, but would likely
be exploited by Hillary types for bad.  If kids can (or will) have
more access to grievance-intermediaries, how can that be controlled,
just enough so it doesn't get out of hand (or has letting the genie
out of the bottle already lost the case for future parents)?

What you just said is the unspoken fear and dread every one of us
wakes up with in the morning (those of us who are still sane).
The U.S. Founding Fathers warned of the need for constant vigilance,
and nowhere is that need better illustrated than here.

"Good" disinformation, such as the MJ-12 stuff released by Bill
Cooper, John Lear, Bill Moore, Jaime Shandera et al, has a quality
that is compelling, if weird and hard to swallow.
The Higher Source crapola OTOH, won't pass first-level inspection
with any experienced UFO/conspiracy buff.  Don't waste your time.
Look for another explanation (i.e., find the money trail).
