Well, I run three remailers, and as far as I know, the system
administrators don't know about them.  Actually, for the two on
rosebud.ee.uh.edu, I don't think the admin would care since it doesn't
take up much cpu time.  The remailers run on previous accounts I had
when I was a student at UH.
As far as Rice, the usage policy states:
:Sending electronic mail directly to an unofficial automatic mail
:handling program is not allowed.  Unofficial means something that is
:not a standard part of the system and has not been installed by the
:Owlnet system management.  Using an automated method to direct any
:incoming mail to an unofficial program is not allowed.
so the chances of me running one here are zero, since I can't really
risk the hassle with my only account.  Well, running it from a school account is probably the least expensive
option :-)  If you have your own machine then that's the way to go!
