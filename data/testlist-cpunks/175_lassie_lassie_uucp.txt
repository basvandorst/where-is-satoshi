Here is a really STUPID FUCKING IDEA: Use a different public phone
for each call and limit your time on the phone to less than two

No free man shall ever be de-barred the use of arms. The strongest
reason for the people to retain  there right to keep and bear arms
is as a last  resort to  protect  themselves  against  tyranny  in
government. <-------- Thomas Jefferson                            --
