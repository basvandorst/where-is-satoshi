@_subject: SunExpress to expand "unlockable" software distribution 
It would probably be a public service if some interested parties were
to determine the ``encryption'' method that Sun Express, the standard
Sun ``license manager'', and other packages use.  At the moment, the
details of these technologies are not described in the public
literature (as far as I know).
Rather than have these companies discover years too late that their
"unlockable" software is really unlockable by anyone who understands
cryptography, it'd be better for them to learn it this year, while
they are still handling low volumes of programs that way.  Also maybe
they will stop dumping these programs-that-you-have-but-must-pay-to-run on us.
