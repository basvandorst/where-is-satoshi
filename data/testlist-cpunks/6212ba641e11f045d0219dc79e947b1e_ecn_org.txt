It doesn't make much sense to renounce your U.S. citizenship if your
relatives, who you care about and who you want to visit, still live there.
What did Vince Cate expect?  He wants to be free to enter the U.S.
temporarily, but doesn't want to be a citizen of a country the U.S.
deems sufficiently similar to itself?  From the American State's

with that kind of status threaten the existence of the U.S.
