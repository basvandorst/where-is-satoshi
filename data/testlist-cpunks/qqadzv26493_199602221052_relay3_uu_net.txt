Re-read my whole statement.  I copy the relevant commentary that you
sloppily forgot to read:
I already entirely anticipated your objection.  And destroyed it.
Quantify, quantify.  How much of a problem?  (Hint:  If you seriously believed there was a problem with this idea, you would be able to give a few examples on how to avoid them.  Reading your commentary, you did none of this.  All the tubes can be filled at the last minute by pulling a vacuum on the
system and letting atmospheric pressure fill all the tubes.  No impurities,
or at least it's a perfectly homogeneous mixture.
"might"?  Well, could you be more specific?  How many nanoseconds would be
too many?
So what's your point?
Sure about that?
Pigs might fly.
How low?  Be specific.
The "gun" design wasn't used with the plutonium, because IT WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED! "Fat Man," the bomb dropped on Nagasaki, used the implosion method.  "Little Boy," the gun-method bomb, used U-235.   Plutonium detonates far too rapidly to use the "gun" method.   The scientists knew that in 1945.  You seem to be at least 50 years behind the Sheesh!  I guess we now know what field YOU don't know about, huh?  Or, perhaps more likely, this is a specific DIS-information campaign.   You want someone to waste a critical-mass worth of plutonium.
