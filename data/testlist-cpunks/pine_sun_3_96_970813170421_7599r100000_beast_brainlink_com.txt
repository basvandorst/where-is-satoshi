@_subject: Encrypting same data with many keys... 
If there were random padding, I don't think it would increase the
security.  PGP uses one conventional key and multiple PK encryptions of
it, with different padding (I think).  Then you only have one message to
send out, i.e. pk1,pk2...pkn,convenc instead of pk1,cenc1 pk2,cenc2...
