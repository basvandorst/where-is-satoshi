I do use the term "evil" occasionally, but it's usually referring to ideas
or nasty hacks, and usually in a jocular fashion.
At first I thought in this section you were arguing against this particular
use of the term 'evil,' and then you go on to say that the use of this term

Evil *is* a subjective concept, and whenever you hear it you should

While reducing loss will certainly help, the NICT paper you link to will
not. Quantum cryptography relies on only having a single entangled
particle going to each end, so that if anyone intercepts either particle
and attempts to measure whatever property you're using to derive the key
(polarization generally), the keys will not match because the quantum
state will be destroyed.
The paper you link to talks about creating large numbers of entangled
particles. While this is useful for sharing quantum computations over
long distances, it is not at all useful for quantum cryptography,
because one could intercept a small number of these particles, measure
them on each of the possible axes used for the cryptosystem, and figure
out the shared key.

No problem. Not having read the actual paper, I'm not even sure what
they meant by "noise" preventing amplification of quantum signals in an
EDFA. Quantum states cannot be copied, which seems like a more
fundamental problem, but perhaps they are talking about the potential
for using an EDFA just to create a large number of entangled particles.
I'm fairly optimistic for a couple of different reasons. First of all,
progress on quantum computers has been very slow and the experts in the
field who have spoken up believe it's unlikely the NSA has a major
breakthrough on this front. Second, I'm skeptical that quantum computers
can even be made to work at all. While D-Wave and others have built

evidence that they behave as one would expect for such devices, nothing
has yet been demonstrated that could not easily been achieved with a

expired or we'll have found alternative cryptosystems that do not

(Take everything I say here with a grain of salt; I'm not a quantum
physicist, nor have I ever even taken a quantum physics class. I just
read a lot about this stuff and think about it a lot.)
Quantum entanglement is inherently difficult to explain because it's a
consequence of the prevailing interpretation (the Copenhagen
interpretation) of quantum mechanics, that the spin axis isn't actually
"chosen" until you measure it. Unfortunately, the information that's
supposedly "transmitted" instantaneously doesn't originate from outside
the system, so it can't be used to send anything useful to human beings.
There's an explanation that's slightly less awkward in my view: that the
information about what axis you're measuring the spin on actually gets
transmitted backward in time along the particle's path to the point at
which the particles became entangled. It's less awkward because it
doesn't require anything to happen faster than light, and it doesn't
allow paradoxes because you can't actually get anything useful back
out. This interpretation is known as "time symmetric quantum mechanics,"
but unfortunately there aren't a whole lot of papers on it because the
Copenhagen interpretation is quite dominant.
Special Relativity itself actually doesn't forbid traveling or sending
information faster than light; it just forbids accelerating a massive
object to or through the speed of light. There has been talk of
"tachyons," particles "born" traveling faster than light and possessing
imaginary mass, since the earliest days of SR. Since they would allow
the creation of paradoxes and have other strange properties such as
accelerating as they lose energy, most physicists assume they do not
exist. They've even created a principle, the "Causality Principle," that
forbids them. The Causality Principle simply says that all observers
must observe two events that are causally connected (i.e. exchange any
information between them) occurring in the same order. This property can
only be true if information is transmitted at or below the speed of
The Causality Principle is the weakest principle that prevents paradoxes
within Special Relativity, but it turns out a minor tweak to SR enables
a weaker principle to prevent paradoxes: the addition of a "privileged"
refernce frame. In particular, the reference frame in which quantum
entanglement is assumed to operate, which may also be the reference
frame of the cosmic microwave background. The revised, weaker Causality
Principle says that any two causally-connected events must be observed
to occur in the same order *to an observer in the privileged reference
frame.* That gets rid of the speed of light limit entirely, as long as
you don't travel back in time in this one particular reference frame. It
would probably also make the Copenhagen interpretation of QM preferable
to the time-symmetric interpretation, but I haven't thought that one
through yet (in fact, I don't understand how they measure the speed of
the quantum connection yet either).
That means quantum entanglement *could* actually carry useful
information, and we could (in theory, anyway) construct an Ansible.
Before you go off saying "but SR says there's no privileged reference
frame!" it actually doesn't. It says you don't *need* one. Lorentz
constructed the geometry Einstein borrowed for Special Relativity
specifically to explain why the Earth's motion relative to the
luminiferous ether could not be detected. Einstein's major contribution
(for SR, aside from E=mc^2) was the realization that Lorentz's geometry
obviated the need for a luminiferous ether entirely. But perhaps quantum
entanglement can give the luminiferous ether a new life.

This is exactly the model of the mind that I believed in when I was in
college. These days I believe that consciousness consists of information
but that information, far from being static, is actually the connections
among potential events. It's like a complex machine: pull lever A here
and gear B over there moves. The complex set of (abstract, not concrete)
connections that makes up the "model" of our reactions to various sets
of stimuli *is* our consciousness, versus there being some component in
there that produces the illusion of consciousness.
I'm sure that sounds sort of crazy; condensing such a large set of
varyingly intuitive leaps into a single paragraph is probably not such a
great idea. Happy to provide more background on the list or privately

Very interesting. "Cryptosphere" is a good name for such a system,
though from what you describe there the project seems more concerned
about identifying content than people, whereas my idea centers around
identifying people, with content being secondary.
Yeah, to me verifying key fingerprints is a lost cause - people will
never do it. Instead we need the socialist millionaire protocol for
bootstrapping, and a web of trust. Or the very simple fact that you got
someone's public key via a MITM-proof channel in the first place, like a
QR code on a business card, NFC, etc.
Can you elaborate on this? By metadata I was thinking of things like
filename, content description, ratings, etc.
Given that the part that needs to be small is the public key, what's the
benefit of using the same private key? Once you have an Ed25519 public
key, you can always do an authenticated Diffie-Hellman exchange with an
ephemeral session key, which gives you perfect forward security if any
individual session private key is compromised.
I ran across CurveCP before and had forgotten about it. Embedding and
congestion control are primary requirements for me, and libutp fits the
bill, even allowing the user to provide a callback for sending and
receiving data, which is where I'd apply the encryption.
The system you describe could certainly make a good platform for what I
describe, though I'm far more interested in the "applications"
themselves, i.e. chat, publishing, sharing, etc., than in the underlying
infrastructure. My primary concern about the underlying infrastructure
is that it be secure, easy to install/use, doesn't use a tremendous
amount of CPU or bandwidth (this should ideally run on mobile phones),
and connects reasonably quickly.
All of the applications could even be written in Javascript and
distributed through the network itself, signed by their authors. They
could run as web workers using a particular protocol to talk to the main
app if the network runs in a browser, or in QtScript if it's a native Qt
app. I have no idea how to securely run untrusted JS in Java, though.
I'd like to implement as little of this as possible, since it's a pretty
big undertaking and will require a number of iterations to get something
usable. That's why I am thinking of things like embedding I2P and
Freenet or Tor and Gnunet. I'd prefer C++ and Qt over Java, though
building for Windows will be a bit of a challenge, especially for Gnunet
with its huge number of not-very-crossplatform dependencies like
libgcrypt, among others. I'd love to have it able to build in VS, but
Tor won't either IIRC.

Hopefully Moore's Law will save us, but I actually expect that, should
Bitcoin continue to grow, most payments will be made through payment
services of some kind, with the actual transactions only used to deposit
money in your account with the payment service. This is analogous to how
gold was used once banking became popular.
Should these payment services become full-fledged banks, they could help
with the deflation problem as well by engaging in fractional reserve
banking, the same way banks did with gold. Many people have a negative
impression of fractional reserve banking, but in fact most of the
instability experienced in the US was actually caused by restrictions on
branching and requirements that banks invest in the debt of states that
kept defaulting. Bank failures were much rarer in countries without
these requirements. For example, Canada had *zero* bank failures during
the Great Depression and only created a central bank for the purpose of
facilitating international payments, so that Canadian banks and
businesses didn't need accounts in London.

difficulty can be easily adjusted according to some difficulty

Sorry for the delayed response. I managed to lose track of this message
migrating between Gmail and my own server.
I like Ed25519 because the public keys are 255 bits long, which makes
them potentially usable directly as identifiers. However, more recent
events have changed my thinking on this. Schneier speculates that one of
the NSA's breakthroughs the Snowden documents talks about may be an
advance in the cryptanalysis of ECC systems, and he recommends sticking
with better-studied, more conventional systems based on the conventional
discrete logarithm problem.
On top of that, given the dynamic nature of cryptographic technology,
it's probably not a good idea to lock oneself into a particular
cryptosystem or hash scheme or even to require that identifiers be keys
themselves. An identifier scheme could support Ed25519 as one
particularly convenient key type, but eventually we'll want to support
fingerprints as identifiers and fetching of public keys from a DHT.

Either way, this is not equivalent to introducing trust into the system
where it did not exist before. My claim about proof-of-stake not being
trust any more than proof-of-work is stands.
I was proposing using coin days destroyed as part of the "difficulty"
computation, which would mean they actually DO have value, since you cannot
use the same coin days more than once, and they would reduce the number of
CPU cycles you need to burn in order to produce a block. The idea is to
reduce the cost of mining in terms of pure CPU cycles by giving value to
something that currently has no value: coin days. So you actually CAN do
such math still.
This is not a pure proof-of-stake system, though. I am as skeptical of pure
proof of stake as you are.
Not knowing you, this doesn't tell me much, since the same could be said of

There are a couple of problems people are trying to solve with
proof-of-stake. The first is that the value of mining will eventually go
down, meaning people will be willing to devote less computing power to it,
reducing the cost of an attack. The second is that, even if it didn't go
down, we don't necessarily want a huge fraction of the world's computing
power devoted to mining. The goal is to take some limited resource that
doesn't depend on a trusted third party and that is difficult to corner and
use that to distribute voting authority. In addition, we'd like the people
doing the voting to have an economic incentive to vote correctly. Bitcoin
does that by paying them to vote and revoking the payment if their block
doesn't end up in the main chain. Proof-of-stake does it by hoping that the
voters care about the integrity of the system, similar to only allowing
landowners to vote, only (hopefully) without the ability to prevent others
from becoming stakeholders, which I think is your main worry about it.
Incidentally, the coin days are from ALL of the transactions in the block,
not just your own. I'm not sure if I was clear about that before. You could
maybe override a transaction that had fewer coin days, but you'd have to
burn a similar amount (though less) of CPU time in addition.
Speaking of which, is there any reason peers couldn't watch for forks and
incorporate any still-valid transactions into new blocks and permanently
blacklist any outputs that get double-spent? You could create a special
"blacklist" transaction that just incorporates the two separate spends into
the main chain, so that everyone could validate that the account holder
attempted to double spend.

and blog post.
I think this is a good idea. Spam can be handled by just signing all the
pages and having signed white and blacklists to create a web of
trust/distrust. Proof-of-work could be used when creating new signing
identities in order to make the blacklists useful.
I imagine something as simple as StumbleUpon, just "I like/dislike this",
perhaps with tags. One could add a signed inverted index as well to
facilitate searching by phrase.
Been thinking about it for a while ;-)

References: Worst case, can't you just compute pairwise keys for each pair of

it's easy to understand and implement, and most multi-party conversations
don't end up with that many participants anyway.
I think the biggest problem with trying to do anything clever here is that
keeping everyone in sync while simultaneously preventing DoS by one

ensure everybody got the messages in the same order, and you'd have to keep
around old keys and messages until everyone acknowledged them, otherwise

Given that a V2V system can only warn of an impending collision with
another V2V-equipped vehicle, this seems ludicrous to me. Passive systems
like radar and lidar will be cheap enough to be in nearly every new car
soon enough.
However, even if V2V ends up being mandated, whether it's abusable is very
implementation-dependent, and there are already plenty of ways to track
vehicles: license plate scanners, toll transponder readers, even just plain
old image processing on existing surveillance cameras to track vehicles
probabilistically. Oh, and then there's that cellphone you're probably
carrying with you.
Some of these are easier to avoid than others, and a V2V system could
probably be disabled easily. But we're already being tracked, and I doubt
there's much incentive for a politician to go out on a limb to make it even
easier. If we really want to avoid tracking, it's the efforts to network
and database security cameras and ALPRs that we need to go after. Those are
much harder to avoid, even if you don't own a cellphone and ride a bicycle
or walk everywhere.

It works far less, though, since most people expect others to rely on
search engines, so they don't bother to link anymore.
Here's a thought: browser extension that stores your "personal" web index,
and gives you a typeahead menu when you write about concepts in your index,
prompting you to convert phrases to links. Like the way Facebook always
wants to convert the names of people and pages to tags. Even if it were
just primed with Wikipedia, that would drastically reduce the amount of
Google searching people need to do when reading stuff you write.

to improve the utility of the AwesomeBar interesting.
An even simpler proposal: assuming the AwesomeBar doesn't already include
live bookmarks in its autocomplete functionality, add it. Then anyone can
simply publish their bookmarks via RSS and anyone else can import them.
Then someone can just add functionality to create live bookmarks that pull
signed and possibly encrypted (with Ed25519/Curve25519 of course) RSS feeds
from a DHT.

So what do people think of David Brin's "transparent society" approach to
this problem? We can't completely stop ourselves from being watched, but we
can make use of all this technology ourselves. Police have ALPRs and
dashcams and bodycams, but by and large they have actually resisted
expansions of their own surveillance because they want the flexibility to
be able to make up justifications after the fact. Phone cams have for the
most part taken that choice away from them. The result seems likely to be
less police abuse than at any point since at least the early 20th century
in the US.
Even Snowden's leaks were enabled by very similar technologies to what the
NSA deploys against us.
Is there any reason to believe that, overall, technology will benefit
governments more than it does individuals?

Sounds possible but much harder to do and with lower impact than
backdooring a widely used CPU, at least until a bunch of people the

important" than non-anonymous connections during attacks. You may not agree
that that's a good heuristic, but if that's your problem with it, say so.
"Anti-DoS attack improvements, by Mike Hearn. It's currently possible to
jam a Bitcoin node by connecting to it repeatedly via different IP
addresses, as there is a fixed limit on how many connections a node will
accept. Once full, no other peers or wallets can connect to it any more and
serving capacity for new nodes and P2P wallets is reduced. If the attack is
repeated against every node, the entire network could become jammed.
"This patch set introduces code that runs when a node is full and otherwise
could not accept new connections. It labels and prioritises connections
according to lists of IP ranges: if a high priority IP address connects and
the node is full, it will disconnect a lower priority connection to make
room. Currently Tor exits are labelled as being lower priority than regular
IP addresses, as jamming attacks via Tor have been observed, and most
users/merchants don't use it. In normal operation this new code will never
run. If someone performs a DoS attack via Tor, then legitimate Tor users
will get the existing behaviour of being unable to connect, but mobile and
home users will still be able to use the network without disruption."

Way back in the beginning I said an ever growing block chain would cause
unacceptable costs and inconvenience, and lo and behold, it is causing
substantial and ever growing costs and inconvenience.
Of course, restraining the block chain to manageable growth without
losing other good characteristics is inherently hard, and it was a lot
easier for me to point at the problem than to fix it.
 I had been hoping that we would see more stuff happening off-blockchain by
now, with Bitcoin acting more as a clearing house between smaller payment
providers, but all the regulations protecting the big banks from
competition make it really hard to do anything off-blockchain that looks
even remotely like a payments service. Side chains of some kind seem like a
reasonable approach, and I'm guessing that it will be the difficulty of
dealing with the "central" block chain that will finally force people "over
the hump" into using some kind of sidechain payments system. I really want
to see micropayments, for example, and those seem to be too unwieldy and
expensive to do the main chain.

Transparency is also useful, and privacy can be built on top of it through
the use of, say, Chaumian e-cash backed by a blockchain-based
cryptocurrency. It's a lot easier for the issuing organization to prove
that it has a certain amount of Bitcoin than a certain amount of gold.
E-gold and even one of the gold ETFs have been accused of double-counting.
And if you're using Tor to connect to the network and break up your
transactions, it's pretty easy to obfuscate, even without ZeroCoin, and
ZeroCoin just fixes the whole problem.

Really? What rich person has gotten richer through Bitcoin so far?
Remittances seem like the biggest use of Bitcoin at the moment. Sure,
there's plenty of speculation, but your claim that Bitcoin's purpose is to
make the rich richer is also speculation. And FUD.
I can't imagine you've read a single thing written by the people who
influenced the creation of Bitcoin if you think that the collapse of fiat
currencies is an unintended consequence. Any fiat currency that is so bad
that its users prefer to use Bitcoin deserves to collapse. Of course, so
far, while Bitcoin has become popular in places like Argentina and
Venezuela, the US dollar remains by far the more popular alternative
currency in those places. And if Greece exits the Euro and starts printing
Drachmas there, they will have to worry about people trading their Drachmas
for Euros, not for Bitcoin.
 By what evidence do you estimate that this is a "likely" scenario? You may
be right that many nation-states and banks will be loathe to accept an
untraceable and uncontrollable crypto-currency, but that's the whole point;
they're not going to have a choice. Cryptocurrencies don't have to be legal
to be disruptive. The main problem that they've run up against before now
is the lack of healthy underground markets to take advantage of them. Given
time, governments' and banks' opinions and policies about cryptocurrencies
will become irrelevant.

This is not what most people mean when they say "rich get richer." They're
talking about 1%ers or whatever. In any case, you still seem to be making
unfounded claims about the intent behind Bitcoin, when we have statements
of intent in the creator's own words. Many believe Satoshi is also rich,
Bitcoin-wise, but we don't even know for sure that they have the key to the
account or that they will ever spend that Bitcoin. Personally, I hope they
do. The creator of Bitcoin deserves to be rewarded.
No real way of knowing. I only have anecdotal evidence.
Probably a lot. But that's true of cash as well.
My apologies. I was confused by your use of the phrase "government cash."
Government cash is fiat, but not all fiat is cash. But the cashless
societies already being proposed and implemented are fully centralized and
much easier to trace than Bitcoin, because they require bank accounts with
their concomitant "know your customer" regulations. Bitcoin doesn't make
this situation worse, and by enabling other applications on top of it,
including untraceable e-cash, will only make it better.
Can you elaborate? Does your use of quotes around the word "popular"
indicate sarcasm? My understanding was that a number of merchants had
started using a payment system that used dollars from foreign credit cards
to buy Bitcoin so that they did not have to accept the government-imposed
exchange rate. I'm definitely interested in your insights on this, since
I've never visited a country that was experiencing rampant inflation,
unless you count the US in the late '70s, about the time I was entering
grade school.
I think you overestimate the government's ability to exert control,
something many of the participants in this list have devoted their lives to
reducing. It's the whole point of Bitcoin, so it seems like you're
basically just saying "Bitcoin will fail at its mission and instead just
get coopted by the powers that be." Or maybe you think that Bitcoin is just
a reckless toy created by greedy first worlders?
It depends on what you mean by "exist." The people on this list have
created several. It seems like a major reason that none of them has taken
off has been the need for trusted third parties, something that can be
reduced or eliminated through the use of the blockchain, if not Bitcoin
itself. Bitcoin could, for example, be used as a clearing currency between
various Chaumian e-cash issuers, the same way gold used to be used as the
international clearing currency until Bretton Woods.
Indeed, something I have repeatedly ranted against. So far the regulation
has not had much impact on Bitcoin itself. No legally "tainted" or
"whitelisted" coins yet.
I'm not even sure what form outlawing Bitcoin would take in the US. I
suppose they could try to define mining or even running a full client as
operating a payment service. But that would take some backtracking after
all the regulatory efforts. Which may be a reason I should not be ranting
against regulation; it hamstring's government's ability to completely
outlaw it later.
Perhaps, but that actually seems to be the crux of what we're arguing about
here, and of many arguments on this list. What are the actual capabilities
of the adversary? You don't want to underestimate, but at the same time, if
you overestimate, you may miss a potential solution. Some are probably
living as hermits because they think they're being monitored and/or given
cancer by the smart meter mesh network. Personally, I tend to doubt that
the government's capabilities significantly exceed what's available to the
general public, except in terms of the money they're able to bring to bear,
which is blunted somewhat by the extreme inefficiency of government
A "litmus test" issue might be whether you think the NSA's expressed
surprise over Snowden's leaks was genuine. I tend to think it was, and that
his documents are genuine. I see no reason for the NSA to be substantially
more competent than, say, the OPM. They're each large organizations with no
bottom line that attract people of flexible moral character who are
attracted to power and/or job security. I don't think those traits tend to
lead to effective organizations, as much as a number of Hollywood movies
would like us to believe.
A kind of fun book on the OTHER side of the spectrum from what I believe
about government's capabilities is Daniel Suarez's book Influx, about a
government agency tasked with keeping technologies out of the hands of the
public. I think you'd need a pretty substantial head start before
technological advantages can overcome organizational and general human
disadvantages, though. I.e. leaks, infiltration, etc.

thing and detect and backdoor each of the major open source processor

On the other hand, I also seriously doubt Intel CPUs are backdoored, so
maybe my paranoia isn't properly calibrated. Even if you generally trust
Intel, though, FPGAs could still potentially protect you from all the
investment the NSA has undoubtedly put into finding bugs and side channels
in the widely used CPUs, though. And being much simpler, something like
OpenRisc or J1 or SPARC v8 probably has far fewer places for such
flaws/side channels to hide.
On the gripping hand, none of those processors gives you an equivalent of

something very grave is going on. And as usual, not a single hex dump of a

supposedly disabled Ethernet port, not out of their supposedly disabled

thing. But as I read, I kept wondering where the "there" was. But this
feels far more like the sudden significance everything takes on when you
take a hit of acid or are about to have a temporal lobe seizure than a
genuine realization.
 I'm not saying these capabilities don't exist; I'm sure they do. I'm not
even saying the author is lying or stupid. But most of us who are attracted
to security research are a bit "on the edge" to begin with, and it seems
like Snowden's revelations and the like have created all-powerful bogeymen
in some of our minds and pushed us over the edge. We have people making
claims like the NSA can break any encryption, that computers are
communicating by sound (yes, BadBIOS is another of these), and that they've
been "painted" by a network with all sorts of vague capabilities.
I've been reading these stories with an open mind. Maybe some people in
this field just talk that way. Maybe they're vague because they want to
keep their research proprietary. But if that were the case, why not say so?
Why not say what work you have yet to do and give an approximate date for a
full announcement?
Even assuming some of these claims are true, not asking for more evidence
robs us of the ability to defend ourselves. Running off to build f2f
networks is fun and all, but it's not going to do a lick of good if we have
no idea what we're up against beyond some vague descriptions, especially
when you consider that the capabilities of our adversaries go well beyond
the technological. There is such a thing as technological security that's
"too good", when you've spent all your time defending against technological
attacks only to succomb to, as others on this thread have pointed out, a
rubber hose.
I love that this group is open minded. I love that anyone can make a claim
and it will get seriously considered by many without requiring special
credentials. But I also feel like a lot of people here are very easily
ratholed by extraordinary claims that lack not just extraordinary evidence,

It seems to me the real problem would be the community making a big deal
about the fork, not the fork itself. Maybe the fork will take off, in which
case anyone who has a position in Bitcoin now will have a position in the
forked currency, or it won't, in which case who cares? Sure, Bitcoin might
be less valuable for a while while people wait and see how the fork does,
but anyone who thinks a hard fork is a large risk to Bitcoin compared to
all the other risks it faces is deluding themselves.
I think we would all be better off if the community said, "Fine, fork if
you want. May the best fork win," than to sing doom and gloom every time
someone decides not to follow the community process. Besides, a bunch of
different people being involved does not a decentralized system make. Not
if they all have to follow the same process and forks without consensus are
not allowed. That can actually be worse in many ways than a benevolent
dictatorship, because it will quickly ossify as the community grows larger
and more diverse.
If Bitcoin itself had to get community consensus before it was tried, we'd
have no Bitcoin. I have no problem at all with someone deciding to fork it.
In fact, I *prefer* it, because I think in the long run it makes my own
position *more* valuable to have different forks trying different things.
Anyone who holds Bitcoin before the fork gets the sum of the values of
their account on each fork. Over the long run, the value on most forks will
go to zero, but then it's at worst a max function.
Claiming that forks make Bitcoin less valuable sounds to me a lot like
Bernie Sanders saying we don't need so many choices of deodorant.

It seems to me that people are terrified by a hard fork because they have a

By the way, "consensus" is a red herring thrown out by those who never want
there to be a fork. There can never be consensus for a fork, because
otherwise it wouldn't be a fork. Claiming there needs to be consensus is
just a way to try to make it look like any fork is somehow unilateral and
undemocratic. But to succeed, any fork by definition needs broad support.
In fact, it's about the most democratic you can get: people put their money
and their mining power on the fork they want. It's those opposing any fork
who are the authoritarians. Obviously, when you consider who's making the

Which means that those with a stake in Bitcoin are better off if a fork
becomes popular than if an altcoin does, because if a fork becomes popular
they will already have a stake in the fork, whereas if the altcoin becomes
popular at the expense of Bitcoin they will have nothing. Of course, if a
fork undermines faith in Bitcoin without becoming popular, everyone will be
screwed. But I don't think this is likely; either it will become popular

Bitcoin, one that would not have affected a proposed fork or altcoin but
that instead wipes out Bitcoin holders and undermines faith in all

you make lots of false dichotomies here, neglecting the variations in
exchange value between these possible altcoins and forks.
"will have nothing" is not correct.
  maybe a little, maybe a lot, but more than "nothing"
 I'm simplifying out of necessity. Obviously there are intermediate
outcomes possible.
totally screwed - this is where the heated passions about a non-census
hard fork come in. lives on the line, in a not so exaggerated sense.
Yes. And a failure to accept responsibility for one's own decisions. Anyone
gambling everything on Bitcoin right now is an idiot, in my view. Their
opinions should be discounted as they have proven their own judgement
lacking. Perhaps they will be vindicated, but the fact that you happen to
win a poker hand you played badly doesn't retroactively mean you played the
hand well. It means you got lucky.
and by no means am i threating anyone with harm!  i am explaining that
when someone puts  the last half decade of their life and fortune into
a thing, messing with it will always generate inflamed arguments.
regardless of if you're ultimately right or not.
Never said you were the one making threats, and I agree this sort of thing
will create inflamed passions. All the more reason to try to filter out the
opinions of  those with a large stake.
i don't care how you describe that messing, consensus or not, it's
poking in sensitive places all the same...
 A fact that makes Satoshi's decision to remain anonymous seem even wiser
in retrospect. Perhaps this will be required of any such system in the
"not likely" - you're going to gamble livelihoods on a hunch that it's
not likely?
I'm not proposing anyone gambling anything. The gambling is being done by
those holding Bitcoin. Holding Bitcoin places no obligation on anyone else.
It's not a stock or bond or other instrument with an associated contract.
you can see why many are so reluctant - the due diligence is lacking
and the demeanor more experiment than careful transition...
I doubt there is anything the larger stakeholders (as fraction of their net
worth) would accept as due diligence. Nor is any required to start a fork.
Any due diligence is the responsibility of those choosing to operate on the
fork. Those involved should do it to maintain their reputations, but if
they don't, and people get burned, their reputations will suffer. Death
threats and advance pseudo-democracy not required.

this is not about poor user decisions,
 this is about violation of the contract "a bitcoin is forever (and in
the blockchain)"
With a hard fork, the Bitcoins exist in both forks. If one dies, they live
on in the remaining one. If Bitcoin itself is never forked and dies, the
contract is violated. But I have to ask, contract with whom? This is part
of the specification of the protocol, but people are only bound by it
insofar as they choose to implement the protocol. And probably as far as
they choose to participate in the network. But a fork need not require any
interaction with the original network aside from fetching the block chain
prior to the block it forks from.
 you see expediency, and no excuses for those lacking judgment.
 their eyes prescient instead, until one comes to change the rules out
from under their feet...
I see what could be the only viable course. Consensus is not practical in a
large, diverse community with vastly divergent goals.
 to assume old coins can "just be" resolved for all holders in all
circumstances is to lie, and there is nothing else to call
"deprecating old coins unilaterally" other than a hard-fork, and a
non-consensus one at that.
Nobody can deprecate old coins unilaterally. It's up to each individual to
decide what they're worth and whether to participate. As I said, as I
understand your use of the term "consensus", a hard fork is by definition
non-consensus, because if there were consensus everyone would just switch
to the new protocol. Sure, people could consent to allow others to work on
another protocol, but there will always be plenty of people who only want
there to be one chain, so consensus of that form is impossible.
sure; these are very different from a "non-consensus hard-fork"
 [deprecate old, force to new]
intentionally trying to divert and betray the contract inherent since
the start - a bitcoin is forever - is more than "just a fork", it's
also a stab in the back.
I am sympathetic to the view that "law" = people's reasonable expectations,
but whether those expectations are reasonable is really what we're
discussing here. I think Bitcoin is both too immature and too decentralized
to be able to say yes. Maturity will eventually trump decentralization for
this purpose.
 i don't know how to solve a transition like this, but i know a forced
hard fork is near the worst way to handle it.
I think "forced" is too strong a word here. Against whom is force being
used? Who is having to do something against their will? Or who was
defrauded and by whom? From a consent standpoint, this is no different than
forking any other open source project.
agreed; thanks for the patient response to my dismissive retort.
best regards,
 And thanks for taking the time to discuss this.

AIUI state-sponsored actors have primarily been targeting people from their
own state, so to the extent "hayrab" governments have been going after
accounts, it's been other "hayrabs" trying to free their own people. And
the Chinese and Russians figure largely as well, again primarily going

Christian and Jewish and are probably going after the accounts of Muslims
quite frequently.

David C. Rose's "Moral Foundation of Economic Behavior" cites some pretty
convincing evidence that individualist moralities (perhaps what people here

I was already biased in that direction when I picked up the book, so I'd be

that all the other human beings are also using up resources, so if we did
not coordinate our use of resources (via the market) we would exhaust them
and perish.
As an anarchist I disagree with this characterization.

No. Society is an emergent phenomenon whether or not you want it to be. It
does not pre-exist individual interactions with one another. A thousand
people who never meet and whose actions never affect the others do not form
a society. It is not until they get together and interact that you have a

Even without a government, I think an anarchic society will still need
institutions to function, even if those institutions are entirely
voluntary. I can imagine sets of institutions that would allow corporations
in a similar sense to how they exist now, i.e. limited liability and some
form of "personhood." The most likely such institution would be some kind
of court system where, in order to have access to the court as a means of
seeking restitution, you must agree not to go outside it to go after any
other participant, and must not have done so before.
This is a question I think about all the time.
I see revolutions as a symptom of a broken society. Reform, or evolution,
is certainly preferable.
The French and English revolutions both resulted, after a while, in better
societies than they started in, as far as I can tell. The Haitian
revolution ended slavery there. I don't consider the American revolution,
on the other hand, to be a counter example, though it clearly inspired the
French revolution. Not to say that the French revolution and other reforms
of European monarchies wouldn't have happened anyway.
Same here.
While I think agorism's approach ("grow the counter-economy and the state
will eventually whither away") is provably ineffective, I do think it has a
lot to teach us here. Its main problem is that government is always "just
good enough" that people will continue to resort to it, and people are
forced to pay for it whether or not they make use of it, and they may not
opt out of its jurisdiction. One must not only create alternatives to
government services, they must be alternatives people actually use.
One of the pieces of evidence used against Ross Ulbricht was a post of his
in which he stated, "I am creating an economic simulation to give people a
first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without
the systemic use of force." Whether or not Silk Road was that "simulation",
the general statement is exactly what we need to do, in my opinion. Create
systems of "law" and "governance" that do not require the use of force.
These systems do not have to be all-encompassing; they can be small and
narrow in scope. They just have to make it so people don't feel like they
have to resort to government (i.e. force) to achieve their ends.
Just like they do with the "wild west", I think people drastically
underestimate the amount of spontaneous order in black markets. Hollywood
certainly feeds of it with post-apocalyptic movies & TV shows that depict
everything going straight to "anarchy" the moment there's a hiccup in
government. But history demonstrates that in fact the exact opposite is
true. The only time things descend into "anarchy" when the government falls
is when the collapse of the government was caused by violence in the first
place, or where the government's failure had left society "hollowed out."
Somalia is probably the best known example of this happening. I think
Russia after the collapse of the USSR is probably a more typical example of
what I believe to be the common case.
Security of property and computer systems is an area that's pretty ripe for
non-government solutions. I doubt most readers of this list assume that
they can just rely on police to prevent their car from getting stolen or
house from getting broken into, or think the police will come along and
investigate after the fact, then catch the thief and get their stuff back.
No, we all have insurance, locks, good passwords with two-factor and/or
public key authentication, probably cameras, safes, crypto, etc. A lot of
that is pretty hard to use, though, so maybe we should be focusing on
making the solutions we use available to the masses.
Thanks for this post, by the way. One of my favorites on cpunks to date.

Agreed. I'm just saying that such an arrangement is not inconceivable in an
anarchic/voluntary society. And without the state to force it on everyone,
assuming no single "court" system comes to dominate and abuse its monopoly
position, I doubt it could be nearly as harmful. And even if some court
does become a monopoly, since opting out of even a monopoly voluntary court
system is far easier than opting out of a state.
Agreed. Though even under the status quo there are situations where
corporations lose their limited liability, such as in certain criminal
scenarios. Limited liability can only apply in a voluntary society where a
transaction has taken place. Third parties can always sue in some court
that does not recognize the limited liability, and it may well be that even
within the same court system, they decided to drastically limit the scope
of limited liability, for example only to situations where a transaction
has taken place. Not sure what that would mean to, say, product liability
where a third party is injured, though. But unlimited product liability
could result in a far smaller number of products. Who'd make a car, for
example? Or an airliner? Sure, the airline could require passengers to
agree not to sue, but they can't do that for people on the ground. Under
the status quo there's blanket indemnification for airlines and aircraft
manufacturers. That is probably not the best solution, but I also don't
know what is or how one would implement it in a purely voluntary society.
Intuitively I think (hope) it must be possible, but I am by no means
Or maybe unlimited liability is just no big deal and limited liability has
always just been a way for some people to gain advantage over others.
Perhaps without a system like the US's that encourages frivolous lawsuits,
there would be no need.
I think by the time revolution happens, people HAVE done these things, and
the government's response has been to crack down rather than reforming.
Exactly what is happening in the US right now with police brutality.
Perhaps if more people got involved, the government could have been
convinced to reform rather than cracking down further, but it is a central
tenet of governing that you need to have a reasonably large and productive
class that is happy with its modicum of control, i.e. the "middle" class.
Keep them happy and protected from the lower class, and you can keep
society under control.
I suppose it depends on how you're counting. Reform happens all the time.
Not often reforms the size of what you get from revolutions, but I'd say
far more positive change happens through gradual reform than directly from
revolution. But perhaps I'm setting the bar too low by qualifying it with
"If only enough people would resist". But keeping people from resisting en
masse is government's specialty. This is classic prisoners' dilemma. As
Mike explains in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, sometimes you have to make
things worse before they get better. I.e. convince people to revolt by
making it so they are no longer comfortable.
I think Uruguay is actually on the forefront of drug legalization. Colorado
is ahead of Amsterdam, even, because drugs have never really been legal
there. Buying and using is legal, but a bunch of other necessary parts like
growing & transporting are not. The authorities just look the other way,
but can change their minds at any time and have cracked down in the past.
Indeed, and even if/when it succeeds, Google will just become another
vertically-integrated telecomms giant.
Research can never prove something is secure, only that it's insecure. Low
latency onion routing is about as crappy as you can get when it comes to
anonymity, just a step above a chain of proxies. I see no reason a high
latency mix net couldn't be made sufficiently secure with, say, operators
in mutually antagonistic countries.
Maybe. Definitely if you assume that government will eventually outlaw all
anonymous use of the Internet. Of course, then they could always phrase the
legislation in such a way that an N2N mesh network is also covered. Are you
forwarding packets from your neighbor to a different neighbor? Well, you're
"providing a public communications service" or some such bullshit.

I haven't yet been able to convince myself that "large and dominant
syndicates" are even necessary. Do we really need large scale coordination
separated into different cliques like that, or is it possible to have a
single large network (in the abstract sense) of distributed transactions?
If transaction costs get close enough to zero, the optimal firm size goes
to one. So the question becomes how much we can reduce transaction costs.
This feels right to me. Which is to say I think it's right but don't know
enough to make a good argument for it.
I don't know if I understand the point well enough to debate it, but I'm
interested to know what your definition of "public" is. Does such a thing
exist with respect to government? Aren't they really government roads?
Please forgive me if that's the exact kind of discussion you want to go
onto another thread.
Yes. Which will be the trigger for the next financial crisis or the one
after (since I think real estate is still fucked).
Or just lobby the government to require the use of your products.

I've been slowly slogging my way through Robert K. Massie's _Dreadnought_,
and it struck me how openly the government of the British Empire considered
themselves primarily protectors of the commercial interests of British
companies. I suspect future historians will think us terribly naive to
think that capitalism and mercantilism are different things. Capitalism,
for the most part, seems to be just mercantilism with less transparency and
the more competition for the government's favor. "Competition" being
competition to see who can give the most political donations to the right
people, etc.
I think most of the time it's not even fear of being shot,  though. It's
fear of losing privileges. Anyone can be blackballed in any industry at any
time. Just associate them with kiddie porn or name them as a "person of
interest" in some investigation.
I think it's both, really. You qualify it with "political" here, and I
think that's right. Unfortunately it's a pretty "charged" term, though, so
it will only convey your meaning in particular circles.
I haven't yet been able to figure out how much of a collectivist or
individualist you are, but "democracy" strikes me as a fairly collectivist
term. It's rule by the people over all the other people. I prefer rule of
oneself by oneself. To the extent possible, at least.
Perhaps "opt-in direct democracy" would be a better way to define
I'm a fan of "polycentric order" or "polycentric law" myself. Though that
may assume certain factors that you don't think are warranted.
How about families or even just individuals?
The temptation to design is a very hard one to avoid. It took me a long
time to break myself of it. In fact, it was an individualist anarchist who
finally broke me of the habit.
Despite probably being the "wrong" kind of anarchist according to many
here, Hans-Hermann Hoppe does a pretty good job of obliterating the notion
that voluntary societies cannot defend themselves from traditional
nation-states in _The Myth of National Defense_.
In any case, though, Zen (and I) expect such a society to evolve alongside
and among traditional nation-states, so it has to be able to protect itself
or it could not exist in the first place. So there's no need to "site" the
society anywhere.
If we do get access to our own planet, though, it might help things along a
bit. Of course, then you run into the problem that all
intentional/constructed communities run into, which is that they have an
extremely low probability of success. This is one of the reasons I've
mostly gotten over the idea of seasteading as the answer to our problems.
Of course, while an *individual* seastead might have very low probability
of success, tens of thousands might produce a couple of interesting ideas.
 ...
And a "transition" or "emergency" government that's really just a
dictatorship and lasts a very long time.
And often this is "literally" true - the old servants become the masters
and the masters become worm food. And then the old servants are just as
brutal of masters, if not moreso, than their old masters. Especially if the
new masters really did comes from the lowest echelons of society where they
have no experience at all with leadership. At least internal coups don't
tend to have this problem quite so badly. But they also don't tend to
change much.
Personally, I don't plan to go to war at all, ever, if I can avoid it. And
by "avoiding" I mean "can physically escape with my loved ones," not "I've
tried everything else to effect change and now must take up arms." I care
enough about my home to kill an individual or small band who try to invade
it, and even to band together with my neighborhood to do so, but not to go
to war. I'm not sure I could tell you what the crossover would be in terms
of level of organization, but I'd guess it's at the level where we need to
resort to any kind of abstraction.
They are not on the bottom, though. They are the bourgeoisie. They
typically form alliances with those on the bottom by promising to make
their situation better, though never better than their own. Go with us to
war and we'll share the spoils (unequally) with you.
Historically, it's been very hard for small syndicates to grow into large
ones without winning favor from the existing players. Today we have Ubers
that can grow without having a revolution. It used to be much harder.
I don't consider this a likely contingency. The trend has been toward LESS
violence, and there is no particular reason to believe that there's a
simple inverse relationship between income and fertility rate. Doesn't mean
I am not hedging against such a possibility, but I'm certainly not betting
on it, just making it more likely my family and I could survive it if it
The economies of developed countries are too intertwined for USD to "go
down hard" without taking a lot of other economies with it. What do you
think will happen to the Chinese economy if, for example, the US suddenly
stops buying their products? They'd have a bunch of saved dollars to spend,
and the best way to spend them would be on American goods. More likely it
would be gradual and we'd see a shift in the US back toward manufacturing.
The US government actually *wants* the dollar to decline in value. It makes
US products more competitive both domestically and abroad. It causes
inflation and thus reduces real incomes and debt. It would put a bunch of
people back to work. Sure, skyrocketing oil prices would hurt the US
economy, but look how much US investment there is in electric cars, solar,
etc. And nobody in the US is going to be buying Chinese solar panels when
they're no longer cheap. They'll be buying American ones.
Yeah, I don't see history as a series of disasters either. Just paradigm
shifts. But I guess I'm fundamentally a "progressive" and not a
neoreactionary. But then again, I don't see how anyone who understands
evolution can think it can't apply to human knowledge & culture as much as
it does to genomes. Unless they're predisposed to believing there's nothing
they can do anyway, because they would otherwise feel back about NOT doing
anything. Most of us do seek meaning, after all, and it can be hard to
accept that your life thus far has had none. Or maybe I'm just more
sanguine about it because I have my backup strategy: kids. And I want to
believe they're not destined to live in a world that's shittier than the
one I grew up in.
I'm not opposed to "radical decentralization of industry and agriculture,"
provided there is not a significant reduction in productivity, which with
improvements in technology there doesn't have to be, especially when you
account for the increase in resilience & the reduction in the (presently
hidden/subsidized) cost of transporting food/goods over long distances.
I suspect this is the direction technology is already leading us, though.
Take steel mills as an example: they reached peak scale in the 1950s or so
and then got outcompeted by smaller, more flexible mini-mills with smaller
machines with less up-front investment. Farming equipment is getting
smaller and smaller, and I suspect a lot of the current scale of farming is
a result of artificial barriers to competition, *not* the technology or
genuine economies of scale. Get rid of those barriers, and the scale will
naturally fall as smaller, more flexible firms and individuals jump into
the market.
I think the only thing I'd add here is that it's important not to lump all
genetic modifications together. While some of them may be "gratuitous" and
dangerous, others may turn out to be vital, like salt tolerant crops, more
nutritious grain varieties, etc. I suspect patent reform would go a long
way toward reducing the problems with genetic modification.
I would submit that progress toward a more voluntary society would ALSO
produce greater resiliency. How do you propose to convince a large fraction
of the population to move away from cities, farm, and make their own stuff?
How do you propose to get them to stop using computers, or to decentralize
the manufacture of computers? I'm not saying this is not doable. In fact, I
think it IS doable, but it's going to take the development of new
technologies. I'd love a chip fab that I could own as an individual or in a
partnership with a few friends. I'd love a robot gardener that could turn
my back yard into a farm without my needing to spend a significant fraction
of my time doing it (which is also known as "subsistence.")
And without a global market for food, how do you propose we deal with local
disasters? Shall we force societies to rely on charity in cases where under
the present system they would have just increased their imports slightly?
"Eat local" doesn't work when there's a "local" drought.

Yes, but when you say "mercantilistic device" I think "device used by
mercantilism," not "device that is inherently mercantilistic by its
nature". If you mean the latter, I don't think the generic concept of a
corporation qualifies, since it's just "a group of people who have chosen

Apple has created a MUCH higher value target than an individual iPhone, and
I doubt they've made it enough more expensive to crack than an individual
iPhone that they won't eventually be forced to break it. Of course, forcing
them to break it is tantamount to outlawing such a system anyway, so it
doesn't actually have to be impossible to break, just hard enough that the
law has to change in a significant way before they can be force to break
it. In which case they'd just switch to key escrow anyway and we'd all feel
sorry for them because well at least they tried.
Perhaps it's my lack of imagination, but this doesn't seem to move the bar
much on the "reckless, dangerous, or impossible" thing. They were able to
build the vault because its functionality is essentially identical to the
Secure Enclave chip. Its construction, AFAICT, does not prove that one can
build a similarly secure system that could allow selective access, because
the immutability of the system means you would still need some kind of
master key to authenticate to it to get it to decrypt individual secrets.
You still need physical access, of course, but then it's just a plain ol'
HSM, is it not?
The other property that lets this approach work is that even if the device
fails, that just invalidates people's keychain backups. It doesn't destroy
their original keychains. I'm guessing that Apple scales the service and
avoids the possibility of the loss of a single device invalidating all
backups by having a way to add new master keys over time. Such a mechanism
couldn't be used to decrypt any existing backup, but it could be used to
force Apple to add an escrowed key and get every iPhone to reencrypt its
backup with the new key.

Racism and nationalism are two sides of the same coin. The Nazis were first

own sense of identity is so weak that I can't handle other people
expressing identities that are significantly different from mine." Those

I think the answer is that they're difficult subjects to address. People
generally prefer to address issues they think they understand. Not to
excuse it; it's something everyone needs to work on, but it's going to take
some time. There's also the self-selection effect where most of those who
"roast you in words, with glee" differ from trolls only that they seek out
some form of legitimacy for their trolling. It seems to me that a far
better way to deal with "anti-social communication" would be to ignore it
and encourage others to do so if it's trolling, or to privately reach out
to the person to try to help them understand why their method of
communication is counterproductive, if it seems like they can be gotten
through to.
To be fair, none of us is going to kidnap you and throw you in a cage, nor
shoot you, nor blow you up with a nuclear weapon. There are degrees of
bully. Though I think it would be more appropriate to describe government
as "a home for kidnappers, murderers, and thieves masquerading as a
collective defense."
Yep. Trolling is a problem in any public community. The best way to make
trolls go away if there is no active moderation is to ignore them, but that
requires encouraging those who respond to them to avoid doing so in the
future. IOW, you need leadership regardless of whether you have moderation
for a community to thrive. Moreso, in the absense of moderation.
In crypto-anarchy generally, yes. In this particular community, well, like
in any community it's going to take hard work.
Indeed. I thought this was a crypto-anarchist community, not a space for
social inepts to come where they don't have to take responsibility for
their complete lack of empathy or even basic consideration for others. But
that's probably an unrealistic expectation given the general state of
nerd-dom right now.

This is why you use an attenuator. I wouldn't think law enforcement DF

Perhaps, but I'm not about to suggest that anyone break the law.
How do you train out of band? By modelling the environment? That's an
interesting thought, and I suspect Google Earth has enough data to be able
to do it in a lot of places. Are you aware of free or inexpensive software
packages for doing this?
Aren't you just talking phased array for something like this though? Or do
you mean using phase information from the receive antennas to reconstruct
the environment rather than using phasing at the transmit side to steer
your beam? That's a very interesting idea since it can give you a 360
degree view with no need to steer your beam, in the same way that some

they're a tiny minority. It allows a much greater diversity of thought.

That movement is lasting echos of the closing of the frontier, at least
according to Dan Carlin (and his explanation seems compelling). You can
blame Teddy Roosevelt.
But this is a question I often think about myself. At least in Germany's
case, there was certainly a major trait that was visible from the outside:
crushing debt and economic malaise the country had no way of digging itself
out of. Massive national humiliation. Greece is in a similar situation
today, and Russia seems not far behind. An American political colloquialism
comes to mind: "It's the economy, stupid!"
Which brings us back around to the paragraph you quoted: there was a
revolution because people's needs were not being met. There is no guarantee
that a revolution will wind up with something better than the thing that
caused it. Especially since revolutions are typically driven by a tiny
minority, with the majority being incited by whatever it takes to motivate
them, typically lots of bogus conspiracy theories. Even the American
Revolution was this way, with a large fraction of the populace believing
there was a conspiracy in England to "enslave" the colonies.
I think you will always hear this from authority. It is "blame the victim"
plain and simple. And if you consider the authority legitimate and "just
doing their job," is it not true? The insidious thing about it is that it
presupposes that legitimacy.
how far must this corruption spread before it cannot be stopped
Good question. I was just talking about a related topic recently with some
coworkers: revolutions seem to happen when they are closest to being
unnecessary, otherwise they wouldn't be possible. So I think the answer is
that for corruption to spread that far, it must be pervasive throughout
society, not through some separate thing called "the State." Which means if
the State is really that corrupt, revolution may well be impossible, and
the only solution may be war by other states. Instead, revolution will
happen not because the State is extremely corrupt, since that would require
a corrupt society, but because it is weak and the people perceive it as
can the tools of technology and manufactured consent provide the state
Hmm. I think the notion that the State and the public are not truly
separate applies here as well. So it's not so much that it wouldn't be
detected as that the corruption would encompass all of society.
This is kind of my worst nightmare; that my optimism has been misguided all
this time. I wrote a post on liberty.me about how to deal with an
invincible adversary that may be relevant here:
In the foreward of an obscure book I've started reading, The Omega Seed by
Paolo Soleri, the foreward author talks about how the Christians, instead
of continually trying to fight ineffectual revolts against the Romans as
their Jewish forebears had, instead focused on building communities. I
think we need to focus not only on building communities where we're
connected to one another, but where we're strongly connected to people
around us who may not share our exact beliefs. However you might feel about
cops, for example, if you're friendly with the cops in your community,
they're much less likely to be willing to lock you up and throw away the
key on false pretenses. Even if they know your general beliefs about cops.
Being connected to people makes it much harder for them to believe bullshit
about you. For that reason I doubt I'll be remaining on liberty.me much
longer. I don't want to live in an echo chamber.

people who aren't willing to play ball to remove themselves from society in

omnidirectional antennas on some of their customers' roofs to daisy-chain
other customers off of, not because they use any kind of dynamic mesh
routing protocol. This approach might actually work for setting up a
freenet: negotiate directly with local businesses (particularly public
places like coffee shops) and residents to set up local hotspots, then put
up high-gain directional and omnidirectional antennas on a different band
or at least channel to handle the longer distance links.
Of course, the businesses/residents involved are probably going to be
primarily interested in access to the "regular" Internet, but that doesn't
stop you from using strong encryption on the links themselves, tunnelling
onion/mixnet networks, offering local services in private IP space, etc.
Over time, you can replace tunnels over the government-controlled Internet
with wireless links or leased lines with strong crypto. It won't stop the
network from getting shut down if the links are specifically cataloged and
targeted, but it seems like current "internet kill switch" proposals
primarily focus on the layer 3 infrastructure, not on the link or physical
layers. And certainly not on RF.
But even if you do that, if you are offering a "public" service, and you
actually get a lot of users, it seems likely you'd end up being a victim of
your own success, noticed by regulators and then forced to comply with the
same regulations that cover the Internet, including any retention and "kill
switch" requirements. You might be able to mitigate some of that by
encouraging mac address spoofing and end-to-end encryption, but that
doesn't stop a government from taking over one of the local services and
putting a gag order on the operator, then tracking someone to a specific
coffee shop and sneaking up behind them and pinning their arms to their
sides so they can't wipe their machine. Having a dead man switch/"panic
button" on any local servers, routers, etc might help with that,
particularly if there's plausible deniability there. "Sorry, can't comply
with your retention order because our hard disk just died and it's going to
take us months to get the server back online." It works for the Chicago PD
with their constantly "malfunctioning" dashcams, so why not for us?
One side benefit of bringing back freenets in a big way might be the
ability to push back against regulations that have compliance costs. If a
bunch of people voters care about are dependent for their Internet access
on freenets that would have to shut down if they are required to retain
logs for years and set up systems for easy law enforcement access,
politicians might think twice about pushing for such things. Provided they
can't get away with characterizing freenets as dens of "hackers", drug
dealers, terrorists, and child pornographers of course. Which is why it's
important to remain connected with society and not become hermits hiding
out in Internet backwaters.
There's always more social/community-oriented solutions ala Max Hernandez's
Thieves Emporium where you have secret access points and people need to be
vouched in, but that is incredibly hard and would likely remain quite
small, because the probability of infiltration approaches 100% once you get
into the thousands of participants. And of course, if it's small and
secret, nobody will notice when it and its operators/users quietly get
Obviously these approaches are orthogonal to one another, and you can use
any combination of them.

I laughed out loud when I read on the Invisible Things Labs' Blog that Xen
is "only" a "few hundreds of thousands of lines of code."[1] Sure, this is
small compared to most modern monolithic desktop OSes, but it's not
particularly small compared to a stripped down Linux kernel build, and it's
absolutely gigantic compared to a modern microkernel. The Nova
Microhypervisor and seL4 are each about 9000 SLOC.
But when I shared this disbelief with a couple of friends who at least have
a passing understanding of computer security, each of them just shrugged.
And of course both Nova and seL4 have had a lot of trouble gaining any kind
of foothold in the market.
Am I completely off base in thinking that it should be self-evident that
one should start building any secure system by minimizing the size of their
trusted computing base? Or is the issue that applications are still the
source of most vulnerabilities, so it's premature to try to make the kernel
super secure? Or that there are too many ways to violate isolation in a
microkernel by compromising shared server processes?
I ask because I am wondering if I should "learn to stop worrying and love
the bomb" and (re-)embrace Xen and/or Linux, or if I should continue
pursuing some approach along the lines of seL4/Nova/Genode for building
secure systems?

Thanks for your reply.
On Wed, Feb 10, 2016 at 7:00 PM Peter Gutmann This is my general experience with programming, yes, though it is somewhat
orthogonal to security.
It makes it someone else's problem *in userspace*. Linux supports all that
stuff, but it does so *in kernel space*. And while seL4 and Nova don't
address device drivers, Genode does, by reimplementing the Linux (and
NetBSD, and OpenBSD, and FreeBSD) kernel interfaces (yes, I know in the
Linux case this is a moving target, but Linux has a LOT of drivers, so even
if you're stuck to a narrow range of versions, you can still get a lot of
mileage out of this approach) and then running each driver as a separate
server process.
I'm not talking about raw size or complexity here; obviously having lots of
features and support for lots of devices means high complexity, but it
doesn't require that all that complexity run with full system privileges.

References: <20160706143322.GB30352
My frustration is primarily with people who think that the US media are
somehow "independent" just because they're not directly funded by the
government. But at least government funded media sources have to work hard
to *appear* independent, because they don't get the presumption of
independence. The result is that you hear BBC asking much harder questions
of MPs than you see asked to, say, the President by US media.
The only real solution is to find sources that truly *are* independent,
because they have no special access, don't embed with military units, don't
get invited to White House press conferences, etc. Find the outfits the
politicians refuse to talk to.
In any case, though, I'm not sure I'd choose Putin as a spokesperson
against sycophantic media. He's just missing the good ol' days when the
government mostly controlled what reached Russians' ears.
There are two sides to every story, but usually both sides are wrong. And
the midpoint between them is wrong too. The real story is off on some axis
perpendicular to the line between the two sides. To paraphrase Chomsky
since I've so far failed to find a quote that concisely sums up the point,
if you want to control what the public thinks, narrowly define the
parameters of the debate and then ensure that there's vigorous debate
within those parameters. This is what the Western MSM vs Russian media
sounds like to me. It's all just nationalistic nonsense.

Agree with the need for decentralized architectures, though ZeroNet is only
part of the way there. It's fine for small, static sites, blogs, and small
chat rooms, but the mail and ID services are each controlled by one
individual, and all their data are flooded to all users. We really need a
platform on which to build decentralized apps, more like Freenet or Gnunet.
As for centralization in Tor, it wasn't clear to me from the article that
the related sites were actually legit as opposed to, say, clones. Since
they found sites that only linked among themselves, they must have just
been mass scanning onion addresses. But what we really care about are the
sites a lot of people actually use. For such a purpose, finding and ranking
the sites by spidering from a few well-known seed sites would be more
useful than enumerating all the hidden sites. They talked about a bunch of
sites being hosted by the same hosting provider, but given that they had
identical SSH host keys I'd guess they were all actually the same machine,
since it would be criminally negligent for a hosting provider to use the
same key across all its machines.

References: <20160628084946.GB3088
I like a lot of what you say, and it's great to read the perspective of
someone who is completely outside the western propaganda-sphere, but I find
your devotion to Putin to be both baffling and concerning. There is simply
no way a former intelligence agent and director of an intelligence agency,
ANY intelligence agency, who then somehow rose all the way to be President
of a large, powerful country is "unimpeachable." The rest of the things you
say about him may well be true, except perhaps for the "better world" part.
Nobody can unilaterally stand for the rest of the world unless they are
willing to collaborate and compromise with a lot of other people.
This is not to say that Putin is any worse than any US leader, of course.
But substantially better? I seriously doubt it. I'd be equally concerned
about any US or European leader who inspired a level of devotion similar to
what Putin inspires in his followers. Of course, it is in large part the
West's fault that Russians look to someone like Putin in the first place.
We failed to dissolve NATO after the USSR collapsed, which is part of a
pattern of the US acting like it "won" the cold war (the same way it thinks
it "won" WWII) and thus now owns the planet.
Agreed, though I am not sure about the "nationalistic" part. Multipolar, as
an acknowledgement that not everyone wants the same thing, but I'd prefer
we were all skeptical of our own nation and accepting of others.
"Major war" in the sense that this may be when the world finally realizes
it is not, in fact, unipolar. Once nations start realising the US cannot
keep its promises to protect them, they will start looking elsewhere and
taking more responsibility for their own defense. I feel like the US's
turning to Iran for help with Daesh, along with asking countries to
continue to invest more in their own militaries, is a pretty strong
indication that the US realizes this is happening and that many here are
actually willing to accept that fact. But this is by no means a popular
view here, with both Trump and Clinton promising in their own ways to "make
America great again". I'd prefer "Make America part of the world for the
first time."
I imagine there are those in the US who would welcome a new cold war. They
are obviously trying to create (have created) a new one. It seems like
there's a pretty big risk of taking us back to a bipolar world rather than
a unipolar one.
Not sure I buy this particular theory, considering how strongly GWB pushed
for the invasion from his first day of office. I think it comes down to
simple revenge for the plot to assassinate his father.
Oil is obviously strategic, but I think you overestimate the US's belief in
the risk of the decline of the petrodollar. I think the US convinced Saudi
Arabia to keep pumping despite declining oil prices in order to weaken
Russia economically while propping up its own flagging, net-oil-importing
economy. This plan only works in the short term, though, and it will end up
making Russia stronger in the long term, since Russians aren't idiots and
will diversify. I think Putin's decision to ditch tech and focus
exclusively on energy was a huge mistake that made it more vulnerable to
this strategy than it would have been otherwise, but there is still time to
reverse that mistake.
I don't have a strong opinion on this, other than that it is a matter of
opinion. You request facts, and you state a couple, but you actually need
references. And even with references, accepting bribes is not the only form
of corruption. I consider benefiting from bad things done on your behalf,
even when you did not order them, to also be a form of corruption if you do
not denounce them, investigate them, prosecute them, etc.
It is always true of politicians and cops that it's very hard to point to a
specific evil thing they did. After all, if you could prove it, they would
have been impeached, no?
Well, if it passes, you can always hope the various western countries pass
similar laws. I don't think the US is likely to succeed, but you never
know. The FBI keeps hammering on this "going dark" bullshit.
I don't think the USG has a single intention. But at best, they have
seriously underestimated Russia and been incredibly disrespectful toward
them. But it does seem plausible to me that there are elements in the US
government who wish to pull all of Russia's old partners away to isolate
them. Which seems idiotic to me.
I certainly won't attempt to dispute it. Just the part about Russia's or
Putin's ambitions being particularly pure.
Politicians are never "really fine humans." But I have no doubt that Putin
loves Russia and wants to make it great again. But I have similarly little
doubt that Donald Trump loves America and wants to make it great again. The
devil is in the details.
Perhaps their current leader is pretty damn great, by any and all
Maybe, compared to other politicians.
Multi-polar with relatively high freedom of trade and movement, yes.
Bi-polar with strong nationalism and economic isolationism? No.

throwing their support to the nominee of the Liberal Republicans because
they hated Grant so much. Grant himself was surrounded by scandal but still

The Chinese are pro-China, but they recognize that the US is a very large
market for Chinese goods, and for now their economy is built on exports.
Whatever they may think of the US or Europe, our fortunes are tied together
by trade unless/until they decide to become "self-sufficient," which works
both ways. When this starts to happen, war may not be too far behind.
Exactly. But yeah, 7%. They may be the largest FOREIGN debt holder, which
I'm pretty sure is what Trump actually means.
Yep, just bookkeeping tricks. But yeah, didn't protect the banks back in
the days (1990s) when they weren't allowed to branch across state lines,
were required to hold a large fraction of their debt in their own state's
bonds, and states kept defaulting. And it means a US government "default"
will have interesting consequences.
Not even really stealing. The Chinese people already paid for it by keeping
their goods cheap for us 'muricans. They're basically American taxpayers
for all intents and purposes.
It's hard to blame Trump for believing that the problem with the national
debt is that the US owes a bunch of people money, and therefore the
solution is to negotiate some sort of settlement whereby the US pays less
than face value on its debt. But not blaming him and thinking he's
qualified to be President with such a view are completely separate things.
The problem is not that the US has too much debt. The problem is that the
US is running out of credit. And by "credit" I mean generically *trust.* No
negotiated settlement can recover lost credit. Quite the contrary; if the
US is going to saber-rattle in order to avoid paying what it's promised to
pay despite having its debts denominated in its own currency, that can only
hurt the US's credit with other countries.
Debt is also not the only promise the US federal government, to say nothing
of state and local governments, have made that they are going to have
trouble keeping. There's a bunch of other mandatory spending that's growing
every year faster than GDP with no plan to reduce it: pension obligations,
social security, medicare, welfare. 2/3 of the Federal budget is mandatory
spending. Half of discretionary spending would have to be cut in order to
balance the budget. Half of discretionary spending goes to the military.
And of course, huge cuts like that will also cut into revenue, at least in
the short term, while doing nothing to actually reduce the governments'
unfunded liabilities.
That said, the US is actually in fantastic shape compared to most of the
"developed" world. So interest rates remain low for the US because it's the
nicest house in a really shitty neighborhood. Dark times are ahead for the
entire developed world unless economic growth rates come up quite a bit.

effective for a given application depends on the resources your adversaries
are able and willing to apply to breaking it.
Agreed. It's also the fundamental fallacy behind all of the NSA's attempts
to weaken crypto.
The latter seems perfectly plausible to me. Groupthink.

I am pretty sure I understand your position, and I'm sympathetic to it, but
as an unpatriotic (in the sense that I do not support the government and I
feel physically ill when I see people waving flags) American, I'm afraid
that swapping America for Russia helps me see it better.
I think this points out a fundamental flaw in the Olympics, and in fact in
the entire international system: Individuals do not exist as entities in
the international system. There is absolutely nothing democratic about the
Olympics. The games exist to glorify states over individuals. The Western
media do highlight superstars, but for the most part only American athletes
get highlighted in the US.
I gave up on the Olympics years ago. It is a fundamentally corrupt and
hypocritical institution. And as you can see, it's being used as a tool of
the West to try to punish Russia.
So I totally agree with you, that's not the way a democratic world should
work. But I'd add that the Olympics are not the way a democratic world
should work. In a democratic system, states exist to serve the people. They
should be at the bottom, not at the top.
I agree, though I think most people have always just followed the herd.
Most people have always thought "rule of law" has meant "order", and that a
powerful government unconstrained itself by law, as long as it was tying to
do "the right thing" was the way to maintain "rule of law." Never mind that
precisely the opposite is true.
Which means the line has been being held by... what, exactly? Inertia,
probably. The West has been essentially coasting on the inertia of WWII and
then on the Cold War, which kept lots of people employed in a system that
is unsuited to anything but mass construction for mass destruction. The old
corporate/crony capitalist system is breaking down because the only thing
it's good for is war. The "war on terror" is the wrong kind of war to keep
it going, because high tech weapons are for the most part useless.
Terrorism requires political, policy, *human* solutions. But the system is
not evolved to put the kind of people in power who are capable of creating
those kinds of solutions.
Ironically, as undemocratic as it was, the system that existed in Europe
prior to WWI was probably better suited to small scale conflicts than our
current system. The French Revolution introduced the concept of "total war"
to Europe, and the old system was not adapted to that.
Now "total war" would likely destroy us all, but we're also pretty shitty
at small scale wars. As you've said before, we need to have a multipolar
system again. Such a system would reward diplomacy over saber-rattling.
Doesn't matter so much if there's still a lot of tension, as long as it
doesn't escalate to war. As long as individuals don't get too caught up in
the tension, because the only reason to have states in the first place is
to let individuals conduct their lives in relative stability and peace.

There was a time when your edits would have bothered me, because what I
thought of as "capitalism" was just people freely exchanging with one
another. But that was just a libertarian attempt to coopt a term that was
originally meant pejoratively. I do believe in free exchange (though "free"
is obviously open to interpretation) and some form of private property
(again, open to interpretation). What I don't believe in is economies
enslaved to the state for the purpose of powering the war machine.

In '93 when WfWG 3.11 came out and even in '98, Linux was basically a
hobbyist OS. Nowadays the problem isn't the OS but the applications. If
you're just using a web browser, it's not a problem, but that's essentially
what ChromeOS is from the perspective of the average user, and Android is
rapidly filling that space and has plenty of applications.
Which brings up an interesting point more relevant to the original topic,
which is that to have any amount of security you really need to know what
you're doing. I'm not holding my breath for the government to do anything
about that besides exploit it to increase its own power and spy on us.
The first thing that should come to one's mind when thinking of
government's relationship to private industry and cybersecurity is AT&T's
(and others) cooperation with the NSA and the government's subsequent
shielding of them from any liability for it. That which is permitted
rapidly becomes mandatory when government has all kinds of extra laws it
can enforce at its own discretion, and privileges like indemnification that
it can extend or withdraw as it likes.

It's not entirely clear that it's even legal in the US to force
backdoors/key escrow/etc. And even if it is, the USG seems to prefer more
subtle means of control. Forcing key escrow or backdoors is something of a
sledgehammer, and it gets a LOT of attention from civil libertarians.
Also, I think Apple has had a hand in keeping it from happening. They have
a lot of influence (read: money to pay for lobbyists and donate to
political campaigns), and their whole business model is built on not having
access to your data, to distinguish themselves from Google, which gets a
large fraction of its income from serving targeted ads. Facebook and Google
are starting to do end-to-end, but both companies seem a bit more hesitant
about it. I suspect WhatsApp did it in part to hold Facebook to their word
that they would never scan private messages for ad targeting purposes, and
FB Messenger end-to-end is opt-in AIUI. But even if a ban on end-to-end
might slightly benefit each company by giving them an excuse for retaining
access, the USG seems to prefer key escrow, which doesn't benefit them at
all while creating an additional cost.
Personally I'm a bit conflicted over the whole thing. Pragmatically, not
morally. A ban on end-to-end or even forced key escrow would push the more
idealistic people to start working on and using better open source
solutions. One should not trust any crypto that can be turned off silently
with a remote flag flip.

People renting out entire houses as investments on Airbnb are just a
reflection of the fact that the hotel business is a racket. Don't blame
Airbnb; they're just the messenger. Likewise Uber and taxis. Both
organizations take power away from the rent-seekers and by proxy the
government. Yes they are still centralized and self-interested, but the
real bad guys here are the corrupt city and state governments that are in

References: Neat! It does seem like you're trading "pollution" of the band for power
consumption, though. Even ignoring the tone generated by the "plugged in
device", which is carrying energy but no information and much of which is
wasted, their modulation technique results in significantly more energy
outside of the passband of the receiver than inside. So overall power
consumption goes way up, even though it's not from the battery-powered
device. And then if a bunch of people start using these, the total amount
of energy you need to pump out will keep getting higher and higher due to
the added interference, which will cause battery powered devices to have to
use more power. Possibly surmountable, but still interesting. I suspect
(and I think you may have had this in mind as well) that backscatter
modulation will end up being more interesting for covert applications,
where you use a tiny device with a tiny (or no) battery that transmits by
reflecting some signal that is already in the environment, like an FM radio
station, and you use a receiver that is designed for receiving the
reflected signal including the "mirror image" and a couple of the extra
harmonics. You could see that as a kind of "free" spread spectrum.

On Fri, Mar 11, 2016 at 10:06 PM, Georgi Guninski I can't find any evidence USDA did this, but I do recall reading that the
Japanese health authorities had. But the old levels, much like FCC RF
exposure limits, weren't based on any science showing harm, just on the
levels they'd typically see. That doesn't mean the new levels aren't
dangerous, but it also doesn't mean the old levels were safe. It's all
about cost of compliance. We just need more research to know what levels
are genuinely safe or dangerous. Though to some extent the Japanese are
providing this by acting as a living experiment. If there isn't an increase
of cancers from eating food at the higher levels, then hopefully the higher
levels are fine.

They can't "prove" it, but AIUI given the current evidence there would have
to be something pretty strange going on for it not to be quantum effects.
But even if they ARE using quantum effects, they still need to prove
they're faster than any classical algorithm for some problem.
Depends on what you mean by "practical". Perhaps fewer applications due to
the fact that you can only approximate the answer (with accuracy increasing
as you increase the number of braids), but potentially more scalable
because the braids are more stable. If IBM's computer can't be scaled up to
the point that it's more than a toy, but TQCs can, then the TQC would be
the practical one.
