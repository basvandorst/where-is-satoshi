@_subject: Instant Remailers 
individual to run a remailer anonymously. The idea is to set up the
primary address of the remailer as a nym. That was easy. I've almost
finished the modifications to Mixmaster to allow it to call Raph Levien's
premail package. I've set it up to cause all outgoing mail to chain
through 2 more random remailers before the message is delivered to the
destination. This effectively allows me to operate as a "hidden
remailer-in-the-middle". I'll provide more details when I finish the code
and it's been thoroughly tested.
