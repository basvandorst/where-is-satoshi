Do you trade the QQQ, NASDAQ, or OEX 100? Trade the NQ (Emini NASDAQ) completely electronically in seconds. Sell into falling markets with no up tick rule. Use the leverage of the futures markets to your advantage. E-mini NQ market specs: Each Point: $20.00 per contract
Contract Value: $20.00 times the index: approx 1733.00 x $20 = $34,660
Day Margin:  $3,500 per contract
Scenario:  Buy 10 Contacts at 1733.00
Day Margin: $35,000
Each point = $200 (10 contracts time $20 per point)
Sell 10 Contracts at 1750.00
Profit / Loss = 17 points times $200 = $3400
Remember, the exact opposite can happen too. In other words, if you bought 10 contracts and sold them for a 17 point loss, your account would incur a loss of $3400. Email me more information
