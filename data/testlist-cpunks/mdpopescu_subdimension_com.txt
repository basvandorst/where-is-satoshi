Now I know the general opinion of AARG, and I can't say I much disagree. But
I want to comment on something else here, which I find to be a common trait
with US citizens: "it can't happen here". The Chinese gov't can do anything
they like, because any citizen who would try to "keep watch" would find
himself shot. What basic law of the universe says that this can't happen in
the US? What exactly will prevent them, 10 years from now, to say
"compelling state interests require that we get to do whatever we want with
the little box"? You already have an official "gov't against 1st ammendment"
policy, from what I've read.

References: Wrong. I can do this - I can write IOUs "redeemable" in other IOUs or,
"sometimes", in gold or silver.
The reason the IOUs emitted by the Bank of England were *initially* accepted
was that they were redeemable in gold or silver. *One* reason they are now
accepted is that they are legal tender - you can pay your taxes with them,
and companies are forbidden from accepting them as payment.

Errata: "companies are forbidden from accepting them as payment" is, of
course, "companies are REQUIRED TO accept them as payment".

It does appear that the law in England is not as "demanding" as I believed:

Yes, I agreed with you with regard to the law as it is in the UK. I
corrected my mistake.

Now, I love hyperbole as much as the next guy, but you have no idea what a
Chinese-type police state could declare outlawed. I heard about a country
that declared illegal people's own gold. Wait, maybe you heard of it too!
If China declares that all people with an IQ over 70 are to be killed
tomorrow, they WILL be killed tomorrow, and those few who manage to escape
will be prosecuted by everyone - especially by those with IQs below 70. I've
seen something like this at work in my country, right after our revolution -
the "We Work, not Think" slogan was actually very much in use, and I won't
be very surprised to find people who still believe / embrace it. (People
WERE attacked because they were "intellectuals", which was worse than
"burgeoise" for several months in 1990.)
You still failed to say why. This is Tim "Saying that gold will be outlawed
is silly" May for you.

Murray Rothbard's law number 17: all economists specialize in the field they
suck most. Friedman is good in many areas, but he sucks in monetary stuff,
so obviously he specialized in it. There is NOTHING libertarian in
Friedman's ideas about money.
Oh, a socialist... ok, that's why you like Friedman when he speaks about

There's no such thing as "efficient level", except in the tautology "the
market outcome is always efficient". We both created stuff we didn't expect

@_subject: Markets (was Re: Hayek was right. Twice.) 
I can't see a market defined as anything else than "private property and
voluntary exchange".
Irrelevant. Does Linux scale to your intended target any better? How about a
voluntary army in WW2? People do even "grand" things without expecting to be
paid (or even worse, expecting to die from it), because they want to. If you
want them to produce more, feel free to pay them. Arguments "I don't like
that they only produce this much, so YOU should pay them" are at least

Regarding our recent thread on copyrights and artists who won't create
anymore if they're not getting paid, has anyone ever played with the WinAmp
plug-ins? Some of them are amazingly beautiful.
Now, are they upset that people copy them? On the contrary - some of them
are accused of creating bogus accounts to boost the reputation of their
plug-ins, or lower that of their best competitors. So much for "we won't
create if we aren't paid" - and, again, I'm not talking Britney Spears or
Picasso here, I'm talking beauty.

I have missed that one; however, it is wrong - if people hold them, then
they become MORE valuable, and thus you have high deflation - the purchasing
power of money grows - which is great. And if their value gets so big that
subdivisions start to become necessary, one can always convert them to "new
betabucks", each old one being worth a million new ones. End of problem.

@_subject: overcoming ecash deployment problems (Re: all about transferable off-line ecash) 
Right. And a shortage of anything, cash making no exception, is solved
automatically (if the market is left alone). The value of a monetary unit
will rise until its price will be considered (by the cash holders) high
enough - that is, until they will value something else more than the cash.
Shortages are NEVER a problem if the market is left alone to clear it - they
simply indicate an undervaluation of the commodity.
Once you put the gov't into the equation, all bets are off :)

I have an application that replaces the caption on the "I agree" button to

Of course, it's a stupid little program, I'm sure anyone can come up with
something better in no time... BTW, for any lawyers around here - shouldn't
the mere existence of this program be enough to blow up the idea that you

Is there a defense against MITM for Diffie-Hellman? Is there another
protocol with equivalent properties, with such a defense? (Secure
communications between two parties, with no shared secret and no out-of-band
abilities, on an insecure network.)

I guess I should have said "no *previously* shared secret".
Well... I assume an active MITM (like my ISP). He's able to intercept my
public key request and change it. Plus, I now realize I should have put an
even harder condition - no previously shared *information*, even if it's
public. I need to know if two complete strangers can communicate securely
over an insecure network, even if they communicate through an untrusted
party. Wasn't there a protocol for two prisoners communicating through an
untrusted guard?

This is the one I vaguely recalled, thank you.
Interesting attack... assuming that a one-block delay doesn't look
What if every message except the very first one has a hash of the previously
received message?
A -> (M ->) B: half 1 of message A1
B -> (M ->) A: half 1 of message B1 | hash (half 1 of message A1)
A -> (M ->) B: half 2 of message A1 | hash (half 1 of message B1)
B -> (M ->) A: half 2 of message B1 | hash (half 2 of message A1)
A -> (M ->) B: half 1 of message A2 | hash (half 2 of message B1)
... and so on
Nah... won't work; since M captures A1 and B1, he can compute the hashes for
both the initial bogus message and the (delayed) genuine ones. Same if they
try hasing all the previous messages.
What if they send the hash of the *other* half? (The program splitting the
messages already has the full ones.)
A -> (M ->) B: half 1 of message A1 | hash (half 2 of message A1)
B -> (M ->) A: half 1 of message B1 | hash (half 2 of message B1)
A -> (M ->) B: half 2 of message A1 | hash (half 1 of message A1)
B -> (M ->) A: half 2 of message B1 | hash (half 1 of message B1)
... and so on
Nope, no good... M fakes the first message in both direction, and then he
always has a good one, so he can compute the hashes.
The only thing that might, as far as I can see, succeed (with a high
probability) would be for everyone to hash the *next* half - meaning that,
together with half 2 of message N, there will be the hash of half one of
message N + 1. However, I don't see how this would be possible for an
interactive communication...
