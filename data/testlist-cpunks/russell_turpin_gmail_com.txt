@_subject: [FoRK] The torture memos have been released 
The ACLU is hosting them here:
Bush's torture policies have been known for some time now, but it's
important to shine as much light on this as possible. Gary Greenwald,
who has done well at following the extent to which Obama sometimes has

greater respect for civil liberty comments here:
Kudos to the ACLU for pursuing the legal and political process that
led to the release of these memos.
