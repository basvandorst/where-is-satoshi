There have been several requests for information on the company that makes the radiation detectors with RS232 interfaces that I mentioned.
Here is how to reach them:

Perry -
     Sorry for the rude question.  I have been following this thread      closely but must have missed the original message regarding using      radiation detectors to produce random numbers.

Generating good random numbers is key to operating a solid cryptographic system. I've argued that computer interfaced radiation detectors are the optimal way of generating such numbers because they are hard to screw up -- biased diode noise and other sources are too easy to misdesign or misuse. Aware is a source of such detectors.

It is a well-known fact that it was common practice for NSA operatives to

masquerade as Injuns in the 1800's and waylay Pony Express riders in order                             ^^^^^^
I think you'll find the NSA was not in existence in the 1800's.
to intercept communications between targeted parties. This practice lost popularity towards the end of the century with the advent of boxed cereal, and with it the Lone Ranger Decoder Ring, since the operatives were too underfunded to afford anything more than oatmeal.

Why am I getting this when I am already subscribed to the list??????

Welcome to the cypherpunks mailing list!
If you ever want to remove yourself from this mailing list,
you can send mail to "Majordomo at toad.com" with the following command in the body of your email message:
    unsubscribe cypherpunks cypherpunks at toad.com
Here's the general information for the list you've subscribed to, in case you don't already have it:
About cypherpunks
I. Administrivia (please read, boring though it may be)
The cypherpunks list is a forum for discussing personal defenses for privacy in the digital domain.  It is a high volume mailing list.  If you don't know how to do something, like unsubscribe, send mail to
 majordomo at toad.com
and the software robot which answers that address will send you back instructions on how to do what you want.  If you don't know the majordomo syntax, an empty message to this address will get you a help file, as will a command 'help' in the body.  Even with all this automated help, you may still encounter problems.  If you get really stuck, please feel free to contact me directly at the address I use for mailing list management:
 cypherpunks-owner at toad.com
Please use this address for all mailing list management issues.  Hint: if you try to unsubscribe yourself from a different account than you signed up for, it likely won't work.  Log back into your old account and try again.  If you no longer have access to that account, mail me at the list management address above.
For other questions, my list management address is not the best place, since I don't read it every day.  To reach me otherwise, send mail to
 eric at remailer.net
This address is appropriate for emergencies (and wanting to get off the list is never an emergency), such as the list continuously spewing articles.  Please don't send me mail to my regular mailbox asking to be removed; I'll just send you back a form letter.
Do not mail to the whole list asking to be removed.  It's rude.  The -request address is made exactly for this purpose.
To post to the whole list, send mail to
 cypherpunks at toad.com
If your mail bounces repeatedly, you will be removed from the list. Nothing personal, but I have to look at all the bounce messages.
There is no digest version available.
There is an announcements list which is moderated and has low volume. Announcements for physical cypherpunks meetings, new software and important developments will be posted there.  Mail to
 cypherpunks-announce-request at toad.com
if you want to be added or removed to the announce list.  All announcements also go out to the full cypherpunks list, so there is no need to subscribe to both.
II. About cypherpunks
The cypherpunks list is not designed for beginners, although they are welcome.  If you are totally new to crypto, please get and read the crypto FAQ referenced below.  This document is a good introduction, although not short.  Crypto is a subtle field and a good understanding will not come without some study.  Please, as a courtesy to all, do some reading to make sure that your question is not already frequently asked.
There are other forums to use on the subject of cryptography.  The Usenet group sci.crypt deals with technical cryptography; cypherpunks deals with technical details but slants the discussion toward their social implications.  The Usenet group talk.politics.crypto, as is says, is for political theorizing, and cypherpunks gets its share of that, but cypherpunks is all pro-crypto; the debates on this list are about how to best get crypto out there.  The Usenet group alt.security.pgp is a pgp-specific group, and questions about pgp as such are likely better asked there than here.  Ditto for The cypherpunks list has its very own net.loon, a fellow named L. Detweiler.  The history is too long for here, but he thinks that cypherpunks are evil incarnate.  If you see a densely worded rant featuring characteristic words such as "medusa", "pseudospoofing", "treachery", "poison", or "black lies", it's probably him, no matter what the From: line says.  The policy is to ignore these postings. Replies have never, ever, not even once resulted in anything constructive and usually create huge flamewars on the list.  Please, please, don't feed the animals.
III. Resources.
A. The sci.crypt FAQ
anonymous ftp to rtfm.mit.edu:pub/usenet-by-group/sci.crypt
The cryptography FAQ is good online intro to crypto.  Very much worth reading.  Last I looked, it was in ten parts.
B. cypherpunks ftp site
anonymous ftp to ftp.csua.berkeley.edu:pub/cypherpunks
This site contains code, information, rants, and other miscellany. There is a glossary there that all new members should download and read.  Also recommended for all users are Hal Finney's instructions on how to use the anonymous remailer system; the remailer sources are there for the perl-literate.
C. Bruce Schneier's _Applied Cryptography_, published by Wiley
This is required reading for any serious technical cypherpunk.  An excellent overview of the field, it describes many of the basic algorithms and protocols with their mathematical descriptions.  Some of the stuff at the edges of the scope of the book is a little incomplete, so short descriptions in here should lead to library research for the latest papers, or to the list for the current thinking.  All in all, a solid and valuable book.  It's even got
the cypherpunks-request address.
IV. Famous last words
My preferred email address for list maintenance topics only is hughes at toad.com.  All other mail, including emergency mail, should go to hughes at ah.com, where I read mail much more regularly.
Enjoy and deploy.

@_subject: Netscape's random numbers 
Congrats, nice job!
      The Netscape license explicitly prohibits decompiling (except where such       prohibition is illegal).  When this hits the media it will be important to       avoid being tarred with the "hacker breaks rules and breaks in" brush.       More subtly, it's probably a bad idea to call into question the overall       business model of client binaries on the net.
So.  At least they're honest and let everbody know.
      Instead, emphasize importance of open code, public reviews, ability to       link in your own code that meets public specs, etc.  All of these things       the Internet was designed to do, and U.S. ITAR regulations are designed to       prohibit (globally, anyway).  And also that the bad guys will never play       by the rules.  And re-emphasize that solutions are possible, just that the       U.S. government prevents them from being deployed in a global economy.
Here, here!
      Perhaps draw parallels to the recent Microsoft Word virus.

@_subject: Net KiddiePorn Hype on TV 
That's not all.  This morning I was listening to National Peoples      Radio when there was a story about the "Cyber Angels."  It appears      that the "Guardian Angels" from NYC are now out on the net trying to      catch people talking about child pornography.       This will be real interesting to watch.  I don't remember all of the      story, but the best part I heard was when some "Cyber Angel" was      talking about listening a chat session and according to her, GIFs are      codewords for pornography.

Yet Another Alarmist TV Show About Child Molesters on the Net:
During their coverage of an NFL game on Sunday, the Fox announcers plugged an upcoming episode (sometime this week) of _New York Undercover_. They used a depressing line like "Think the Net is a safe place to play ?  Think again !"  Apparently the show will portray a child molester luring kids via the Net, etc., etc. "In a story pulled straight from today's headlines !"
Anyway, the mainstream media trashing of the Net continues. Check your local -Futplex
