Summary: House Science Committee goes on-line
Keywords: Congress House Science Committee
This is the initial posting from the Committee on Science, Space,
and Technology of the U.S. House of Representatives, chaired by the
Honorable George Brown of California.  We have agreed to serve as
the "beta" testers for House Committees trying to learn how to use
the Internet.  We posted this message to some of the USENET
newsgroups that discuss topics relevant to our jurisdiction over
Federal civilian research and development activities to:
     (1)  Increase the number of people who know we do have
          Internet access;
     (2)  Indicate how we can be reached on the net; and
     (3)  Start learning how to take advantage of this information
          system in our daily activities.
Getting the Congress to use Internet has been discussed in a few
threads on various USENET newsgroups of late.  Some of you may be
familiar with the E-Mail Pilot Project established by the Committee
on House Administration, chaired by the Honorable Charlie Rose of
North Carolina.  Those Members of the House currently maintaining
an electronic mailbox for constituent communications may be found
by e-mailing "congress at hr.house.gov" with the text "HELP" or "INFO"
in the message body.  You will receive an automated response with
the necessary instructions.
Also, the text of legislation introduced in the U.S. House of
Representatives during the current Congress is now available on a
W.A.I.S server located at the House Information Systems data
center.  The server may be accessed from the directory at
quake.think.com or using the following information:
     Server:        diamond
     Port:          210
     Database Name: USHOUSE_house_bill_text_103rd
It can also be found on gopher.house.gov in:
     Congressional Information/Legislative Resources
The database contains the text of House bills beginning with
October 1993 and is updated daily.
What follows now is the message you will automatically receive in
response to messages sent to housesst at hr.house.gov, the Committee's
Internet address.  It describes items like the Committee's gopher
server, which you can also find at gopher.house.gov.
                  ----------- begin -----------
     Welcome to the electronic mailbox system for the Committee on
Science, Space, and Technology of the U.S. House of
Representatives.  This Internet service is provided for ease of
communication with the Members and staff of the Committee.
     If your message is addressed to a specific Member, it will be
printed out in hard copy and forwarded to the Member's office for
response by U.S. Mail.
     If your message is addressed to a staff member of the
Committee, it will be forwarded electronically to that staff member
for response.   Depending on the nature of the response, it might
reach you in either electronic or postal form.
     Messages for the Committee press office will be acknowledged
electronically and then followed up on, if necessary, with material
by post or fax.  You can reach the press office directly via
Internet at "sstpress at hr.house.gov".
     The Committee also maintains a bulletin board on the House of
Representatives Internet gopher server at "gopher at hr.house.gov". Much of the public information material provided by the Committee
is available on this gopher system.
     Much of this information also is available on the Committee's
"Straight Talk" voice-response system.  Dial 202/225-3018 and
follow the menu instructions for a touch-tone telephone.
     Thank you for contacting the House Science Committee.  Please
be patient as we experiment with this new way of better serving
your communications needs.  If you wish to write to the Committee,
please direct your correspondence to:
           Committee on Science, Space, and Technology
               2320 Rayburn House Office Building

                      Washington, DC  20515
                   ----------- end -----------
At this time, we suggest you supply both your e-mail and postal
addresses in any communication to the Committee.  Each office in
Congress has its own policy for responding to public inquiries. So, if we forward your e-mail to a particular Member's office, they
may choose to respond with a regular letter.  Our Committee hopes
to increase our use of e-mail in responding to public inquiries.
We have chosen the following subset of USENET groups for our
initial foray into the net.world:
Please feel free to repost this message to other groups that might
find the information of value.  Your comments on what should be
carried by this channel of communications would also be welcomed.

In C, you open file f and
  while (((c = getc(stdin))!=EOF)&&((d = getc(f))!=EOF))
    putc(c^d, stdout) ;
If I remember correctly, Adam Back  has a signature
block for the full C program to do this.  It's that tiny.
In a way, that program is better than RSA in 3 lines of PERL.  It's
provably unbreakable (provided the ranno source, f, is used only once and
is truly random).

@_subject: crypto for porno users 
I hear occasional uproar from LE types about porno traffickers using strong
crypto like PGP.
[I've been known occasionally to say things for their shock value, but this
time I'm quite serious.]
As a society wanting to limit the spread of porn, we should encourage those
trafficking in porn to use strong crypto.
1. If two people are sending porn from one to another over the net, the net
2. If cops want to track down some pornographer (e.g., because he's dealing
3. Encryption of porn would work against the kind of porn distribution
4. Personal file encryption encourages individuals dealing with porn to
These advantages are balanced against the possibility that there is some
group of pornographers who communciate together, who are identified by the
police, who would be wiretapped *and* who are not infiltrated -- and
therefore whose conversations are unavailable to the police.  The larger
such a group, the less likely it will remain non-infiltrated, so these
groups are probably very small.  There might be some of these -- just as
there might be a few pornographers who have diaries that are encrypted and
unbreakable.  However, strong crypto opens a number of opportunities for
successful investigation -- and it's my guess that in the balance, strong
crypto adds up as a net advantage to the police rather than a net drawback.

@_subject: crypto for porno users 
Hi Jay.
We've been hearing about such things (using the mails) for some time.  I
don't know how the cops avoided entrapment when they posed as kiddie porn
customers or pedophiles when they were doing the AOL sting.
It's that informal network which is the danger to the pornographer.  The
bigger the network, the closer to certainty that it's been infiltrated.
Strong authentication via crypto does not create a trusted group.  Trust is
a human:human decision -- subject to severe flaws, none of which are solved
by crypto.  [Can you devise a crypto protocol which will prevent or even
just detect adultery, for example?]  With each additional person, there is
a probability of deception.  For this informal network of yours, deception
by any one participant constitutes a security failure.  If you want to
avoid that, therefore, you need to keep the group *very small*.  If it's
that small, then it's not that interesting a target for LE.
Ah -- but that's the point I was making.  Crypto gives the appearance of
security -- whether it's in the informal network or with file storage.
It's often a bank vault door on a cardboard house.  For much of what people
do, especially if there's a large net, it's not rational to expect to
achieve security.  But -- if people have done something to achieve
security, they're likely to be fooled into trusting it to be adequate.
Meanwhile, if *everything* on the perp's machine is encrypted, you're
probably in good shape.  That means he'll be required to type passwords too
often -- so he'll either pick a small one or have some machinery which
stores the password.  Both give cryptanalytic advantages.
This isn't a guarantee that *every* perp will be wide open.  Some won't be.
It means that a bunch of perps will be wide open (out of their own
carelessness -- like the breaks into the Enigma net).
The question you need to look at is not the control-freak question which
Freeh seems concerned with:
A)	the probability that some one perp will manage to hide his data
but rather the SIGINT question:
B)	the expected percentage of perps who will fail to hide their data
Have a good day.

..so..why the UUCP style address?
Actually, in my view, signed postings are the first step.  With those (and
the right S/W (not there yet)), I get to know that a bunch of postings came
from the same person.  I even know who they came from:  the person who
is capable of signing with key 0xXXXXXXXX.
Since the only way I have of getting to know the person is through those
postings, I get to know that person and through that knowledge I decide
whether or not to trust.
And, yes, I can be fooled.

@_subject: Open letter to Geoff Greiveldinger, DoJ 
I just posted the following.  I'll have to wait to see if the moderator
accepts it.
NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology) held a two day
public meeting on September 6 and 7, 1995 to discuss Software Key Escrow as a
possible means of achieving export of cryptography.
In the morning of 9/7, Goeff Greiveldinger of the Department of Justice gave a
description of the kinds of crimes which DoJ wants to use wiretapping to
solve.  He closed this litany of lawbreaking with the assertion that software
manufacturers don't want to provide products which allow such lawbreakers to
keep their criminal evidence hidden from law enforcement.
I'm sorry to disillusion you, Geoff, but I *do* want to make such systems.
Would you have Ryder stop renting trucks because some terrorist decided to
fill one with explosives and kill many innocent children?  Would you have
Americans stop making automobiles because bank robbers have been known to use
cars for getaways?  Would you have all new buildings constructed with FBI
microphones in every wall because some criminals meet in private rooms in
order to plan crimes?
When an American company sweeps its conference room for bugs, finds some and
destroys them, it doesn't matter whether those bugs were planted by industrial
spies or the FBI.  The company has a right to eliminate them.  When that
company ties two such conference rooms together by video-conference equipment
and encrypts the line between them using strong link encryption, it is
performing the same defensive operation in cyberspace.  It is protecting
itself from spies and it doesn't matter that the wiretaps it frustrates might
be illegal ones by industrial spies or legal ones by the FBI.  The right to
attempt to achieve privacy is a long-standing one in this country and not one
to allow to be lost.
When I design and build systems for privacy for my customers, I am providing
products for law-abiding, honest people.  I am aware of criminals, of course.
Criminals are the threats against whom I protect my customers.  These
criminals are usually not in the government but that doesn't mean that I
believe I should offer my honest customers up for a strip-search in
cyberspace.  The law enforcement agencies of this free country have no right
to expect blanket access to the ciphertext of citizens.  It will take
legislation to get that right and I will do everything in my power to keep
such legislation from passing.  Barring such legislation, I will make sure
that honest American citizens have cryptography with which to attempt to
maintain their privacy, even from the government.  We have the right to
attempt to keep a secret from government agencies and continuous demonstration
of that right is an important part of this free country.
On the other hand, I am sympathetic to law enforcement officers.  I have
several friends in that business.  I have asked my friends and acquaintances
who do surveillance (2 IRS agents investigating organized crime for tax
evasion; 2 undercover cops in Boston's highest drug neighborhood; 1 DEA agent
in the midwest) if they ever encounter encrypted communications or files.
They don't.  Neither does anyone in their offices.  Of course, even if they
did it would remain so important to preserve our right to attempt to keep
secrets from the government that their frustration would just have to be
accepted.  The fact that this isn't a real problem makes my decision that much
easier.  I am left with no moral qualms at all.
In summary, criminals are so few that I will not design for them.  I will not
treat my vast majority of honest users as if they were criminals just because
some criminal might someday use my product and frustrate you.
ObRisk: We run the risk of losing our fundamental right to attempt to keep a
secret from the government -- a practice we need to preserve in order to
protect ourselves from criminals in cyberspace.  There are powerful forces in
the US government attempting to cajole us into giving up that right.
