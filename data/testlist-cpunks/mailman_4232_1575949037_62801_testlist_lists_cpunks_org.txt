The prefix FC00::/7 (i.e. first byte 0xFC or 0xFD) is reserved for
"unique local addresses" (see and RFC 4193). However, I don't think that the arguments that Greg Troxel put
forward apply to such addresses, in general. It's quite plausible that a
Tahoe-LAFS grid could be made up entirely of nodes that are inter-routable
using FC00::/7 addresses.
