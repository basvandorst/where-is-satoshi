What about this:
If (a+b)^(a0+b0) == 0, then the plaintext is the same as the ciphertext.
This happens for one out of every 256 bytes.  Ordinarilly this isn't a
problem, but if the key is reused, and there is no IV, it can leak a byte
of plaintext.
So it seems that you would need to change the key for each message, or at
least use a random initialization vector.
