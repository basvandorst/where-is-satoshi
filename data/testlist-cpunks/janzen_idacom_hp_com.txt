I had to reformat the TAL press releases to make them readable, so I
thought I'd save others the trouble...
TETHERLESS ACCESS LTD. ANNOUNCES STRATEGIC ALLIANCES FOR WIRELESS MAN
October 4, 1993, Fremont, California
Tetherless Access, Ltd. (TAL), a leader in the development of
user-provided wireless metropolitan area networks (MAN), today announced
the formation of three separate strategic business and technology
alliances.  The alliances envision the provision of wireless access,
applications development, packet radio hardware development and new
services for wireless connectivity to the worldwide Internet.
TAL has developed a "plug-and-play" interface for the Macintosh platform
for the unlicensed operation of packet radio systems.  The systems
enable peer-to-peer wireless connectivity over AppleTalk networks within
a MAN environment.  The system software also provides transparent
connectivity to TCP/IP networks and to services available on the
worldwide Internet.
User-provided wireless networking allows anyone within range of another
system to automatically make a network connection.  This "ad hoc"
network means that each node not only generates its own traffic, but
also relays the transmissions of nearby nodes.  Each system owner
becomes a "de facto" member of the network.  The system provides a
low-cost connectivity solution for community networks, libraries,
schools, businesses, telecommuters, and an easily deployed
communications infrastructure for developing countries.  "In association
with our strategic alliances we will deploy wireless MANs on a worldwide
basis with a focus on providing access to the Internet" said Dewayne
Hendricks, President of TAL.
Pandora Systems of San Francisco, CA, a software development and network
operations company, will design Internet-based wireless networking
products and services.  Pandora's principals have been involved in the
establishment of PeaceNet, GreenNet, The WELL and have developed
numerous Internet applications including Veronica, one of the most
popular and useful navigation tools available on the Internet today.
"The Internet and wireless communications are both experiencing dramatic
growth.  The combination of these environments offer unparalleled
applications development opportunities" said Mark Graham, President of
Pandora Systems.
InterNex Information Services, Inc. of Menlo Park, CA, a provider of
high bandwidth connectivity to the Internet, will provide wireline
access points to the Internet for wireless MANs in major metropolitan
areas throughout the U.S.  InterNex and TAL will jointly market network
services to businesses, educational institutions, communities and
Cylink of Sunnyvale, CA, the leading worldwide supplier of commercial
communications security products and spread spectrum wireless modems and
systems, is cooperating in the supplying of spread spectrum radios for
deployment in TAL's MAN packet radio systems on a worldwide basis.
Cylink's founders are leading authorities in encryption and spread
spectrum technologies, and the company currently services customers in
over 40 countries.
Tetherless Access, Ltd., based in Fremont, California, is a leader in
the development and deployment of "plug-and-play" wireless metropolitan
area networks.  The company's products allow customers to achieve
efficient, low-cost, flexible, high-quality wireless data communications
in metropolitan network environments and to the worldwide Internet.
TETHERLESS ACCESS, LTD. ANNOUNCES NET/MAC PRO WITH SUPPORT FOR POWERTALK
October 4, 1993, Fremont, California
Tetherless Access, Ltd. (TAL), a leader in the development of
user-provided wireless metropolitan area networks (MAN), today announced
NET/Mac Pro, a new version of its NET/Mac Internet Protocol application
for packet radio environments.  NET/Mac Pro adds support for a personal
gateway that allows PowerTalk81 users to exchange mail with SMTP servers
over a TCP/IP network.  PowerTalk is Apple's new mail and messaging
technology, built in to System 781 Pro.
This combination provides convenient Internet access for Apple Macintosh
users through wireless Metropolitan Area Networks.  TAL's standard
products have led the way for wireless TCP/IP network access on the
Macintosh.  Now, with System 7 Pro, this access is simplified even more
by not having to use a separate SMTP client program to transfer mail.
"The PowerTalk universal mailbox and drag send capability integrated
with our NET/Mac Pro product allows our users to deploy wireless MANs on
a worldwide basis with a focus on providing easy access to the Internet
mail services" said Dewayne Hendricks, President of TAL.
TAL has formed strategic alliances with InterNex Information
Services, Inc.  of Menlo Park, CA, Cylink of Sunnyvale, CA and Pandora
Systems of San Francisco, CA.  Together the four companies will provide
hardware, software and services which can be used to provide low-cost
MAN connectivity solutions for community networks, libraries, schools,
businesses, telecommuters, and an easily deployed communications
infrastructure for developing countries.  "In association with our
strategic alliances we will deploy wireless MANs on a worldwide basis
with a focus on providing access to the Internet" said Dewayne
Hendricks, President of TAL.

@_subject: Canon copiers 
Yes.  But the thing that makes _me_ skeptical is that there are many kinds
of currency in the world besides the US dollar.  A counterfeiter could simply
copy a stack of bills that aren't in the copier's database (eg. one of the
new currencies issued by countries that were part of the former Soviet
Union), then head on down to the nearest foreign exchange office.
This wouldn't do the job either.  Our Canadian bills, for instance, come
in a different color for each denomination.  Bills from New Zealand and
Thailand, among others, come in a range of colors _and_ sizes.  So your
copier would have to have quite the database...
And what about changes?  The Canadian mint has been altering a number of
bills to add better security features.  Any color copier owners out there
receive mysterious, unsolicited "preventative maintenance" visits lately?
Agreed.  I think we can put an end to _this_ thread, at least!

@_subject: help/subscribe 
Since you mention stdin, I assume you're running UNIX.  In that case, it's
very easy to do this using awk; no C programming required.
To try this out, create a small awk program called subscribe.awk, which
contains one regular expression per "flavor" of subscribe request.  The
command in braces is executed if a match for that regexp is found:
  /[Pp]lease subscribe me/ {exit 1}
  /[Aa]d me to the/        {exit 1}
  /How .* subscribe/       {exit 1}
  [etc.]
Create or capture a suitable example message.  To test it:
  % awk -f subscribe.awk subscribe_message; echo $status
  1
  % awk -f subscribe.awk other_message; echo $status
  0
Or, you can use awk as a filter:
  % cat subscribe_message | awk -f subscribe.awk ; echo $status
  1
  % cat other_message | awk -f subscribe.awk ; echo $status
  0
Now, just wrap it in a shell script which responds with an appropriate
message (you can of course have subscribe.awk return a different exit
code depending on which regular expression is matched), and call the
shell script from your $HOME/.forward file, mail filter, or whatever.

@_subject: Compress before encrypting?  (Was Re: NSA Helped Yeltsin...) 
Most compression programs add a characteristic signature to the beginning
of the compressed output file.  If a cryptanalyst guesses that you may
be compressing before encrypting, wouldn't this make his job easier?
To me, this sounds as though you're adding a known bit of "plaintext" to
the start of each message.
If you're encrypting files that you wish to store securely you could just
clip off the signature, I suppose.  But this would be unsuitable for sending
messages, because your compression program is now incompatible with everyone
Or am I missing something?

@_subject: Compress before encrypting?  (Was Re: NSA Helped Yeltsin...) 
OK; so ideally this is something that would be built in to one's
encryption/decryption program.  I was thinking of UNIX compress,
gzip, and the like.
That's good to know!  Thanks for the explanation, Jay.

@_subject: procmail 
OK.  First -- just checking -- I assume you're running some version of
UNIX.  I'm using HP-UX 9.03 on an HP 9000 workstation, but everything
should work pretty much the same on other systems.
First, you have to tell the mail system that you want your mail to be
filtered through the procmail program.  You do this by creating a
one-line file called ".forward" in your home directory:
"| IFS=' '; /usr/local/bin/procmail -p"
The quotes are necessary.  Replace /usr/local/bin with the name of the
directory in which you've installed the procmail program.  Do a "chmod
644 .forward" to make sure that your mail software can read this file.
Now you can create a ".procmailrc" file in your which tells procmail how to
filter your mail.  Here are some excerpts from mine:

@_author: Martin Janzen 
@_subject: The Cypherpunks' Electronic Book 
I'm not familiar with Majordomo.  But allow me to suggest that this project
might work well if it were organized as a set of World Wide Web pages.
 Starting Point You'd start with a home page located on an easily accessible machine, just
like the Cypherpunks home page that someone (Sameer?) created a while ago.
This machine would run the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) daemon;
a process which accepts requests from WWW browsers and returns hypertext
 Adding Information Now, if someone wants to contribute information to the CEB, they could
create one or more HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) pages.  This is
easy to do; HTML is just ASCII text which contains some simple markup
commands -- like this message.
To add the new pages to the CEB, the author could do one of two things:
 Send the pages to the CEB maintainer, who adds them to the CEB on
the main machine.
 Set up his/her own HTTP server, and ask the CEB maintainer to update
the CEB so that it includes a hypertext link to the author's machine.
Readers can now use a browser like Mosaic or Lynx to read the contents.
 Advantages The WWW approach offers a number of advantages:
 familiarity
The Web is growing at a tremendous rate, and Mosaic is rapidly
becoming the browser of choice.  If the goal is to DISSEMINATE this
IMPOR.. -- sorry, to make the CEB easy for people to use, it would
help if it were based on a technology with which people are already
 distributed responsibilities
It's easy for individuals or groups to set up and maintain servers
devoted to specific topics.  Once a link has been made from the
main CEB, the CEB maintainer doesn't need to be involved in every
change to that subtopic.
 distributed text
The CEB text (and any other software, etc. that you want to include)
doesn't all have to be located on the same machine.  This feature can be
used to reduce the load on individual servers, and to add to the
reliability of the system.  (For instance, the home page could be made
available from several servers, possibly located in different countries...)
 graphics
If authors want to include graphics in their pages, this can be
done relatively easily.
 convenient software distribution
Most WWW browsers make it easy to download files; just click on the
files, and tell the browser where you want them stored.
 feasibility
You don't need to bother Eric!  :-)
 Disadvantages The main disadvantage is that updates would not be provided automatically.
Even if the CEB were to provide a "What's New" page, a reader still has
to follow that link and look at the page occasionally.  Periodic updates
on sci.crypt and other appropriate groups would still be a good idea.

Trade in black-market data is a growing problem for business.  What, if

By Clinton Wilder and Bob Violino (Issue date: August 28, 1995)
The new frontier of cyberspace represents vast opportunities for
innovation, entrepreneurship, and profit-making. But there is also a
dark side to the online world, one that poses a worrisome threat to the
security of corporations.  The Internet has spawned an illegal market
in which thieves use the latest Net software tools to trade stolen
information, including corporate trade secrets.

So are you saying that by signing a nym's key, you're asserting that you
know _the individual(s) behind the nym_?  If so, would this association
not weaken the anonymity of the nym whose key you've signed?
Furthermore, by signing a nym's key you place yourself at risk.  If you
sign the nym's key with your own key -- or sign using the key of your
own nym, and that nym is subsequently "outed" -- then anyone wishing to
find the individual(s) behind any nym whose key you've signed can
attempt to coerce you into revealing this information, since you have
claimed to know it.

I won't repost the entire article here, but here are some highlights:
  - The system is initially intended to secure email between federal
    government employees.  Deployment is expected to begin next year.
  - Key management is decentralized; each department hands out its own keys.
  - Top-secret messages will be encoded using "palm-sized computer cards"
    (presumably some kind of PCMCIA device).
  - The Communications Security Establishment (~= NSA) helped to design
    the system, and claims that it's "more sophisticated than existing
    public versions".
    (This is the part that still worries me a bit, even though EFC's
    David Jones is quoted as saying that he has no concerns.  Will the
    algorithms be published?  Also, why develop a new, untested system --
    why not just buy the thing from RSA, Viacrypt, etc.?  Stay tuned...)
  - There's a great quote from Bob Little, deputy secretary of financial
    and information management for the Treasury Board:  "[The CSE] don't
    have access to the keys . . . and never will.  We did it to avoid
    the American experience with the Clipper Chip."
  - The RCMP (~= FBI) is not amused.
All in all, it sounds like a positive development for once.

@_subject: Vexatious Litigants  (was: SurfWatch) 
I read Henry's question to refer to the case in which the Web page
author rates a page "too low"; that is, in such a way that despite the
use of RSAC/SurfWatch/etc. software, "undesirable" material gets
through the filter. Suppose that an author provides a page which lists, say, clothing-
optional beaches, complete with pictures.  The author rates it as
"suitable for family viewing" -- either naively, believing that no one
will be offended; or deliberately, to make the point that the content is
harmless and _should_ be considered suitable for family viewing; or
simply in order to widen the potential audience.
Henry's question (as I interpret it) is this: If prudish parents now
catch their kid looking at a page with pictures of barenaked people,
figure out why the page wasn't filtered out, and file suit against the
author, what is likely to happen?
ObCrypto, sort of:  What if the page were retrieved through an HTTP
proxy which, unbeknownst to the author (and the filtering service/SW),
deliberately removes or alters the PICS-Label or other rating
information?  The author did, after all, _provide_ the "undesirable"
material....  To what extent does the author's intent matter?  Must Web
authors now add a digital signature to each page (including its rating
info), to prevent tampering? Martin Janzen           janzen at idacom.hp.com

@_subject: HP & Export of DCE 
Yes, there are.  The term "RPC" is sometimes used generically, to refer
to any remote procedure calling mechanism, but also refers to at least
two distinct implementations.
The first "RPC" was produced by Sun's Open Network Computing group.  This
is still the most commonly used, as Sun made the source code available
at no cost [1].  Many vendors (including HP) now provide it as a
standard part of their UNIX distribution [2].  A transport-independent
version, TI-RPC, was later produced, but this doesn't appear to be quite
as widely used, though I think it is in Solaris.  (Sorry, I don't know
of an archive site for this; try Alta Vista et al.)
Sun's version of "Secure RPC" includes Unix (uid-based) and (in North
America) DES authentication.  The basic mechanism can support other
authentication schemes as well, though I've never actually heard of any
alternative implementations.  This is the "Secure RPC" whose key exchange
was cryptanalyzed by LaMacchia and Odlyzko [3].
Another "RPC" comes from the Open Software Foundation, who unfortunately
chose the same acronym for the remote procedure calling mechanism in their
Distributed Computing Environment (DCE).  This DCE is a part of the OSF/1
operating system, but implementations are available for many versions of
UNIX, often as a separate product or option.  The DCE Security Services
are discussed a bit in the DCE FAQ [4], and O'Reilly has an entire book
on the subject [5].
To confuse matters further, it now seems that Microsoft has added an "RPC"
mechanism to Windows NT and 95.  This is sort of compatible with OSF DCE
RPC, but not entirely; see [4].
In short, it would help to avoid massive confusion if people were more
specific: refer to "DCE RPC", "ONC RPC" (or "Sun RPC", if you must :),
or "Microsoft RPC", not just to "RPC".

@_subject: How to use procmail 
A fine idea.  Procmail makes the Cypherpunks list infinitely more readable.
1) First, here's how to get it:
2) Build the procmail program and install it in a suitable location.  I
have no idea what your familiarity with UNIX and C is; you may want to
have your sysadmin help you with this.  Alternatively, you could use
Alta Vista or equivalent to search for binaries for your system.
3) Create a file of procmail "recipes", which tell it how to process
your mail.  This file is called "$HOME/.procmailrc".  Mine begins like
this; fix up directory names as needed for your system:
The last part sorts all mail whose header contains the word "cypherpunks"
into the folder $MAILDIR/Cypherpunks.  Now the fun part -- writing your
"recipes"!  You can get as specific as you want: Rules are evaluated in top-to-bottom order; first matching rule wins.
Anything not matched ends up in your usual $ORGMAIL folder.
4) Run your incoming mail through procmail.  To do this, most Unix systems
let you create a file called "$HOME/.forward" with the following contents
(including the quotes):
"| IFS=' '; /usr/local/bin/procmail -p"
(Replace "/usr/local/bin" with the directory in which you installed procmail.)
5) One thing to watch out for:  procmail is executed on the machine which
handles your mail.  If this machine has a different architecture than your
own machine, you must build procmail for the mail handling machine, not
your own.
Also, the permissions on your $HOME/.forward and $HOME/.procmailrc files
must be set so that they are readable on the mail handling machine.  If
your home directory is NFS-mounted, this should happen automatically;
otherwise, you may need to copy them to the mail handling machine manually.
Finally, the procmail process may not have your userid, so you must make
these files world-readable:
chmod 644 $HOME/.forward $HOME/.procmailrc
For the first day or two, check your $HOME/.procmaillog file frequently
to see whether there are any problems.  Check with your sysadmin to make
sure that your mail isn't ending up "all over the floor".  Send yourself
mail to test "recipes".
6) Once it's running smoothly, you can get fancy and run the following
shell script, which reads the $HOME/.procmaillog file and produces a nice
summary, sorted by mail folder:

GB>I don't see how there can be such a thing as negative reputation
GB>capital. Wouldn't that mean B believes the opposite of what A says?
B wouldn't necessarily believe the _opposite_, but if R(A,B) is negative,
then B would treat whatever A says with greater skepticism.  ("Consider
the source.")
Alternatively, R(A,B) << 0 might mean that B has decided that A's posts
tend not to be worth even the time it takes to read them, and has set
his killfile accordingly.  (Think of someone who makes unsupported
assertions: this is not a reason to believe the _opposite_ of what he
says, but to ignore him.)
GA>If you anti-believed someone in a consistent manner, couldn't they exploit
Sure; see any number of Cold War spy novels for examples.
One point that I think deserves mention, but that I haven't seen yet in
this thread, is that R(A,B) is contextual; it should be R(A,B,subject).
To accept the word of an authority outside his area of expertise is a
common logical fallacy.  (Think of political endorsements by famous actors.)
Conversely, so is dismissing something just because its proponent has a
negative reputation in another context.  (At the risk of flirting with
Godwin's law, an example might be that just because a certain well-known
evil person liked Karl May novels and music by Wagner, this does not in
itself make these things bad.)
GB>For instance, when a certain infamously-low-reputation (deservedly so)
GB>individual recently joined the cypherpunk lists, others who had endured
GB>him in the past tried to relay their impressions of him. It proved very
GB>difficult to convey, and they were somewhat attacked for their efforts
GB>and not entirely believed.
GB>In other words, he *could not* spend down to 0, despite years of
GB>unflagging effort.
I'd interpret this situation a bit differently.  In the eyes of many
list members, this individual _did_ spend down to 0 -- and below, I'd
argue, based on the number of people who announced changes to their
killfiles.  But this was because of his actions on the list; it was
_not_ because of the impressions of others.  Most of the regulars on
this list are, IMHO, logical enough thinkers, and of sufficiently
independent mind (to put it mildly), to wait and see for themselves.
Results in other, more conformist or authoritarian groups may vary...
In other words, it would appear that "reputation capital" is difficult
to create or destroy based only on the word of others; it has to be earned.
(Hmm, is it easier to destroy than to create -- are we more likely to
adjust our R(A,me) score downward based on what others say about A?)
TCM?> But
TCM?> what if the American Heart Association publishes a detailed study on the
TCM?> fat levels of MacDonald's products and declares it to "Dangerous." The
TCM?> effect will probably be greater, as R (AHA, many people) = high, and by the

TCM?> rep of the AHA propagates semi-transitively to the rep of MacDonald's.

TCM?> theater food...sales dropped almost overnight, and now the fat levels of
TCM?> popcorn, etc., have been changed for the better.)
I agree with the first paragraph; however, I'm not sure that the second
paragraph gives an example of this.  The high levels of saturated fats
in movie popcorn were (as I recall) publicized by the previously little-
known "Center for Science in the Public Interest", a group with nowhere
near the reputation capital of the AHA.  Their claims were taken seriously,
not because the group itself was particularly reputable, but because the
results were dramatic and easily verified.   A better example might be
that of Surgeon-General Koop vs. the tobacco companies.
GB>I've already made the points I wanted to make, so I may not have further
TCM>Nor me.
Well, I've probably said enough, then, especially considering that no
one is paying attention any longer.  Wouldn't want excess verbiage to
lower what little reputation capital I may have here...  :-)

@_subject: Junk Phone Calls, Metered Usage, and Cellphones 
I have a similar plan.  My cell phone company includes call forwarding
in the package, so I deal with the possibility of junk calls by forwarding
calls from my cell phone to my regular number (which has voicemail)
during the day, then turning off the cell phone.  This way, the calls
are intercepted right at the switch (I assume), so no airtime is used,
and no charges are incurred.  Works for me...

You might start with the Mail Filtering FAQ:
It's pretty Unix-specific, covering procmail, Elm filter, and mailagent.
For PC-based mailers, you're probably better off checking the documentation
and/or the web page for the one you're using.  Finally, take a look at the
comp.mail.* newsgroups.
Or just use the search engines, throwing in combinations of the above terms...

@_subject: Making Imaginary Sex Illegal 
It's even less of a hallmark of the Canadian government; we've had this
sort of thing for a while.  From the Electronic Frontier Canada archives:
Apparently he was convicted on obscenity charges for scanning in and
modifying pictures from department store catalogs.  However, he was
acquitted of distribution because it couldn't be proven that he did the
actual uploading.  (The lesson being, don't digitally sign all of your
outgoing traffic automatically?)
That's a good point, and will almost certainly come up in someone's
defence arguments sooner or later.
The cypherpunkish answer, I believe, would be to say that images of any
sort should not be illegal, but the means by which they were produced
may be.  In other words, do what you want on your computer, as long as
you leave real kids alone.
Of course, actual laws on the subject will bear no resemblance to the
CPish solution...

                Mondex: A House of Smart-Cards?
  With e-cash, privacy is illusory and security is questionable
by David Jones
Mondex International has already conceded that its electronic
'cash' isn't really as private as they once claimed.  Now critics
are questioning whether their security is all it's cracked up to be.
If crooks managed to create counterfeit cyber-cash, and if Mondex
failed to detect it quickly enough, the deposits backing up the
electronic currency could be drained dry, leaving customers out
of pocket -- unable to redeem the 'value' on their cards.
Do participating banks have any contingency plans for what
Mondex calls its 'meltdown scenario'?

@_subject: CORBA Security beta from IONA 
I just received the latest "IonaSphere" newsletter from IONA, makers of
the Orbix Object Request Broker (ORB), and noticed this item which may
be of interest to some of the people on this list:
I28-B> IONA announces beta of CORBA Security Implementation
OrbixSecurity enables organizations to deploy their mission-critical
distributed systems on multiple platforms securely.  It is tightly
integrated with IONA's leading object request broker Orbix and facilitates
the creation of CORBA level 1 secure distributed component-based
In parallel with the development of OrbixSecurity, IONA is also working on
a secure socket layer (SSL v3.0) solution.  SSL will be bundled in the
company's Orbix/OTM enterprise suite of object development and management
tools, also scheduled for the third quarter.  SSL security offers
authentication (based on X.509 certificates) and encryption (based on
public and session key technologies).
Subsequent to the initial general availability of OrbixSecurity in the
third quarter of 1997, IONA will be working towards level 2 security
support (which deals mostly with the definition and administration of
security policies and domains) via product extensions and third party
The OrbixSecurity beta is available immediately on the Sun Solaris and
Windows NT platforms.  To participate in the beta program send an e-mail
to beta at iona.com

@_subject: Layoffs at PGP 
Well, PGP spokesman Mike Nelson wins the award for the Freudian slip of
the day:
    "Internet Fast-Forward is not as closely related to the tools we
    develop for individuals for privacy," he said. And the fact that
    Fast-Forward filters ads which are an "inimical part of some of the
                                           ^^^^^^^^
    emerging Web commerce models ... we don't want to hinder this
    development."
The  server says:
    Inimical \In*im"i*cal\ (?; 277), a. [L. inimicalis, fr. inimicus
    unfriendly, hostile; pref. in- not + amicus friendly. See Amity.]
    1. Having the disposition or temper of an enemy; unfriendly;
    unfavorable; -- chiefly applied to private, as hostile is to public,
    enmity.
    2. Opposed in tendency, influence, or effects; antagonistic;
    inconsistent; incompatible; adverse; repugnant.
    We are at war with a system, which, by its essence, is inimical to
    all other governments. --Burke.
Perhaps he meant "intrinsic", or "integral" -- although I rather like
the version with the typo myself...  :-)

Yes, I saw this in a bookstore.  It looks interesting; if and when I
wade through my current stack of unread books, I intend to pick it up.
I'd be interested in hearing the opinions of any c-punks who have read
it, if you think it's relevant to the list.
It's Lord William Rees-Mogg.  His co-author is James Dale Davidson,
the founder of the U.S. National Taxpayers' Union.  The two of them
previously wrote "Blood in the Streets" and "The Great Reckoning",
and publish a newsletter called "Strategic Investment".  Davidson also
wrote a pamphlet called "The Plague of the Black Debt" (!), which
appears to be intended as an advertisement for the newsletter.
(I sent away for a sample copy of SI a couple of years ago, and found
it to be a rather odd bird as far as investment newsletters go.  As I
recall, it did have a fair amount of investment analysis and advice --
presented in a rather breathless, hyperbolic style, IHMO -- but it was
mixed in with numerous articles dealing with Whitewater, Vince Foster,
and so forth.  I didn't subscribe.)
