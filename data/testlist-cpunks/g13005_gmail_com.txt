Its nice to know that while they pour money into tracking Diabetics, and
other less common (more life threatening) ailments get pushed to the
wayside. Why not have a thrid party escrow the data for the government? At
least then the data minus personal nfo's can be kept private.
Are there any Hipaa concerns with their present model?
Why not start tracking steroidal/steroidol use to make sure that those of us
where our life actually depends on daily testosterone, vs. those who abuse
Of course I'm sure we can all think of better things to do with New York's

Here is my dumb question for the day, but can someone show me where my logic
has run aloof?
The NSA's claim is not to have listened to the content, just collected it.
"Assuming" their telling the truth on this, I thought they may be trying to
create a bell-curve type application that scans the messages for content
based on predetermined criteria (similar to content filters I assume).
However, the flaw I see is similar to the idea behind changing speed limits
on residential streets. Public safety sets up the electronic signs to
monitor speed limits, and flashes if you travel above the posted limit.
Except the data can be ruined (for lack of a better word) if the drivers
sneak up on the sign and gun-it past it, repeatedly!
How this applies to the NSA model: If normal citizens are polluting their
data by using more vulgar or "terror driven" speech. How will they know
legitimate traffic from crank-yankers?

Maybe its just me, but my brother-in-law and I used to wonder why most of
AT&T's cable traffic routed thru the east coast before going out west (or
asia). This would have been well within the range they decided to setup
camp. early 2002 thru 2003 (maybe 2004). On the MOT backbone traffic was
routed normally, yet at-home it took extra routes.
Tracert after tracert from within att's net, would mention long routes. It
would bounce 3 or 4 times go out the chicago trunk then end up on some cia,
or other federal line, then go back (but this time around chicago) and end
in cali. If our destination was Japan, or Siberia, the chat latency was
I was glad when comcast took over, but then again maybe all this humdrum was
removed from the line (tracesrt's).

of course were riduled as being paranoids or were those

though my favorite plugin was "Carnivore is sorry!"
Everytime, him and I are talking with friends or associates who bring up the
nsa this, or the fbi is spying, we just laugh, because we look at them and
say, "and this suprises you how? hmm, funny I seem to remember mentioning
this a long time ago, and you thought I was a crackpot!" Then we just look
at them, deny what they are saying..."I'm sure I don't know what you are
talking about." or "Maybe you should see a doctor about your recent flares

they would simply offer free internet access, and burry a 'we have the right

Can anyone recommend any good reading materials on switching designs?  I'm

In an ideal world I'd like to make the supply modular and also have built

Thanks for the links & design pointers. I'll willing to admit that I'm not
an expert, but always eager and willing to learn something new!
 [yes I know the lurker finally speaks...lol] I'll try yo keep this brief.
A little history about my background. I was born in the chicago area a dual
citizen (American/German[Transylvanian]), from good stock. Ingenuity,
design, art, music, and sciences, are some of the traits I share with my
family & relatives.
I studied electrical engineering for 3 years in high school (graduated
early), then 2 more in college before switching into the computer network
field. While in college I worked at the sba patent office, reviewing
patents and researching designs.
Going back a little further, when I was a kid I ran a small repair shop,
fixing tv's stereos, etc (anything with cord or ran on batteries). I had a
real knack for fixing broken electronics so they wouldn't break again.
In the early 80's I got interested in computers and have been online since
1985. I used to be an avid reader of 2600, and frequented the meeting in
chicago during the 90's. [I admit I still have my first redbox]. It was
also during this time frame I became heavily involved in amateur and cb
The radio experience led me down the path of becoming an On-Air
personality, where my first radio program attracted 3 million listeners. :)
I'm not afraid to learn theory and good design before embarking on a new
electronics project or any project for that matter. I do admit to suffering
from hobby overload from time to time, especially since I'm interested in
almost everything. I have learned almost everything I know by reverse
At my present job I am well known for having the ability to reverse
engineer a new technical process, document it and train others.
Lately I've found myself burning out of the network engineering field, so
starting projects such as these help me keep things in perspective [house,
car, food, wife, etc]

to believe they can compare themselves against facilities like Equinix.
Especially if the NSA needs more than 10Mega Watts of power all to
themselves. :)
“Building C7 in Utah provides our customers with data center designs and
operational mantras that address many concerns the IT buyer has today; such
as low disaster risk, abundant low latency connectivity options, future
proofing power and cooling, and a footprint they can grow in — all at a
lower cost. C7 in Utah offers a cost-effective alternative to the Las
Vegas, Phoenix, and Denver markets and is well on par with data centers
from Equinix (EQIX), CyrusOne (CONE), and Digital Realty Trust (DRT). The
customer experience is our focus, and our designs to provide
uninterruptible power and cooling are paramount.”
