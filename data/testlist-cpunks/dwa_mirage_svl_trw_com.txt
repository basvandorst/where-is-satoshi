Assuming this is true, it would seem that even good, old fashioned,
paper currency doesn't provide the level of anonymity that one
would think.  Scary...

Check out:
Their idea of "Voice Privacy" is to repeatedly XOR a 260 bit session key
with the data stream.  I quote:
So, while analog calls are not encrypted, you can look forward to COMPLETELY
SECURE (sarcasm) digital transmission.
Wonder how much the Gov'mint bribed the phone companies for this stunt...

@_subject: Factorisation and Discrete Logs (was Re: EE Times on PRZ) 
It seems to me that factoring a large number is no harder than finding
a discrete logarithm.
Assume, for the moment, that an efficient method of computing discrete
logs has been discovered, rendering systems like Diffie-Hellman key
exchange unusuable.
I contend that RSA is now equally unusable.  The following variant of
the Pollard p-1 method should provide an efficient factorisation method
for an RSA modulus, say N.
Choose, at random, "a" such that gcd(a,N) = 1.
Compute x such that:
     a^x = 1 (mod N)          [ Discrete log time! ]
Partially factor x; say x = f  *  f  *  f  ...   where f  is not necessarily
prime.                       1     2     3              n
Note that it is usually easy to partially factor a "random" large integer.
Simply using trial division up to some limit; or, at worst, pollard rho
or pollard p-1 (on x) should suffice.  If you're truly unlucky, pick
another value for a.
     M = a^(10000! * f) (mod N)
Where f is some partial factor of x.
gcd(M-1,N) should yield a non-trivial factor of N.  If it doesn't,
another choice of f and/or a should work.
I'm by no means a professional mathematician, but it seems that this
scheme should work.
Comments, anyone?
