Someone walking around a city shooting a rifle is likely to attract a
lot more attention than a secret network would.  Secondly, the
transmitter doesn't necessarily have to be exposed, it could be kept
hidden and only the antenna would need to be exposed.  You'd have to be
a damn good shot to hit a wire antenna.  Plus the antenna would be easy
to disguise or hide in many places.
Well, you may know that you can reach a certain person thru site and that stie  can be reached thru site 35 or site 68, and so
on...which gives you a sort of virtual-space map, which would reveal
nothing about actual phyical location of the sites or the person you are
contacting.  Suppose you were connected to site  and you were
communicating with site  thru site   Site  could be 50 meters
away, or 2 km, and you would never know the difference because you
didn't have any way to directly contact site   Hence we have achieved
our objective - you know how to contact site  in netspace - it has a
cybernetic location relative to other sites, but that tells you nothing
about it's actual physical location.
