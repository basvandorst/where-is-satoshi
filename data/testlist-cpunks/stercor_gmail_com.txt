Did I read correctly?
An Instant Messaging (IM) add-on to Tahoe-LAFS?
SILC is all but dead.  I can't even find the source code nor contact its
author, Pekka Riikonen.
I don't know whether there are alternatives to SILC.
SILC was a really cool project.

Brian:  Define safely.
I'm in a volunteer grid.  Bulletproof code is important for reliability.
This does _not_ reflect your coding ability.
It's a characteristic of large systems.  I've written large systems and
had unintended consequences from "small, harmless, guaranteed-to-work"
changes.  But, we didn't have a testing environment as complete as
Tahoe-LAFS has.  If new code passes the testing suite, it's most
probably clean.
Change of mind: I like to be on the cutting edge.  I'll put the new code
into place when it's someone says its safe to do so.
Thanks for all your work,
