Said Matthew James Gering,
I'm afraid sir, that your ingonorance is showing.  Pick up any college
(hell, high school) ecomonics textbook.  Certain types of businesses are
inheritly advantagious to monopolies.  The electric company is the classic
example- their is no cost effective way for an electric company to supply
power to a given area unless it is a monopoly.  Certain types of businesses
are suited to certain types of competition, and, unregulated, monopolies
are exactly what you get.  This was exactly the situation that occured at
the turn of the century and it happened because regulation was
non-existant!  Your statement is wonderfully trite but I see no evidence to
support it.
"DOS/WIN based computers manufactured by companies such as IBM, Compaq,
Tandy, and millions of others, are by far the most popular, with about 70
million machines in use worldwide. Macintosh fans, on the other hand, note
that cockroaches are far more numerous than humans, and that numbers alone
do not denote a higher life form." - New York Times
