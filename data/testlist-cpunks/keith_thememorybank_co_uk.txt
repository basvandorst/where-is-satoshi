@_subject: <nettime> The Monetary Future: How Bitcoin Is Being Destroyed 
I wish I could write like that guy. The article exaggerates the threat
posed by Bitcoin and the will/ability of the custodians of state money to
shut it down. But the argument prompts a question that has bugged me for a
while now. How does it come about that one, but only one online exception
to the old regime is allowed to flourish in each sector: Amazon, E-bay,
Facebook, Paypal? Is it the logic of winner takes all or because a licence
is granted to one exception that can be made to toe the line? I recall once
an official of the Fed said they were in two minds whether to classify
Paypal as a bank which would of course shut it down since it couldn't
afford the overheads imposed as a result. But they didn't.I am sure there
is a big fight coming up, but I don't think it will pit the new network
economy against old bureaucratic power. We will not build a better
worldindependently of the institutions that have organized humanity's leap
in 200 years from living off the land to the threshold of global society:
states, cities, capitalist markets, corporations, organized science and
It is more likely that successful developments will build on selective
partnerships between large-scale bureaucracies and self-organized
movements.  In Latin America from the 90s the idea of "popular economy"
sustained a new kind of alliance pushing for social democracy and linking
small farmers, urban informal workers, industrial unions and branches of
the state.  Brazil's government under Lula organized a system of community
banks which combined local currencies and microfinance with devolved
decision-making.  Some governments do play an indispensable role in support
of bottom-up initiatives (think Jaures' associationisme). Just as the
shipping firms of Bordeaux and Nantes played a major role in the French
revolution and the industrialists of Milan and Turin in the Risorgimento,
some capitalist firms today may also play a progressive part in bringing
about greater economic democracy. Safaricom's sponsorship of mobile banking
in Kenya (M-Pesa) is a striking example.
So 'old radical' may not have much to offer the young after all, a
perspective that reproduces the tired polarities of twentieth century
revolutionary discourse.

@_subject: <nettime> Bitcoin, the end of the Taboo on Money 
BitCoin is a bubble like any other. The question is whether it will be the
death knell of techno-utopianism (which I doubt) or rather another
egregious example of cognitive dissonance (Festinger et al When Prophecy
Fails). I wrote the next paragraph last week before the "market correction"
One of BitCoin's boosters in the Guardian video said that it is as big as
the internet, maybe bigger. I have had old friends contacting me via
Facebook for advice on whether they should jump in. What we have here is a
cross betwen a stock market bubble and a Ponzi scheme. BitCoin is a
commodity currency, like gold, but with none of the customary or
institutional supports that keep the gold price up or the euro (RIP) for
that matter. As such it fits the folk model of what money really is. (But
it isn't). Its value is solely a function of animal spirits. These have
been fed by a Spring campaign in the universal media. The history of
bubbles is well-known. Some people get in early and make quick money,
others borrow beyond thei rmeans to get a slice of the action, then there
is selling to cash to take profits, the price falls, panic selling follows,
the bubble bursts.
Actually the analogy between BTC and tulips is strong. At least the flowers
were beautiful. Sure, some people will make money. They always do, but not
as many as lose their shirt just for being drawn in by an exponential curve
going irresitibly upwards. Jaromil's vision reproduces the neoliberal
fantasy that markets can flourish without a political framework. See the
saga of Europe's single currency passim. The existing states can't do the
job either which means we are in for a lot of trouble. You haven't even
seen what a seriosi US/China currency war will look like. There is more to
all this than pinning labels like libertarian and social democratic on
people. This piece is politically and economically naive. But since when
did artists and designers have the time to master historical political
