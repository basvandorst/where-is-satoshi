The human genome has approximately 3 x 10^9 base pairs. Each base is represented as the following binary code: G=1000, A=0100, T=0010, C=0001. Thus the human genome represents about 3 gigabytes of info (uncompressed),
as Perry said easily transmitable by fiber optics.
When you all do finally get your genome sequenced, the last thing you should do is let anyone see it (perhaps only small segments of it). I can think of no better use for cryptography than to keep citizens genomes to themselves. Would you give anybody a crystal ball which tells of your past, present and future? Some of us write genetic code and, IMHO, one's own genetics are a source code which should not be freely distributed.

There are four base pair combinations, but HUGO (Human Genome Organization) has elected to use 15 letter symbols in it's representation
of the genome coding sequence (X is any base, for instance). 15 symbols, 1 byte.
Lee Hood is working on the technology (PCR, for which Kary Mullins just won a Nobel Prize will help) for sequencing large amounts of DNA code, granted it's
15 years away at least, but just wait. Also, Have you been reading French Anderson in the New York Times?

@_subject: Bandwidth limitations, DNA binary coding 
Oops, I stand corrected, 15 symbols half a byte. What I was trying to convey is that GenBank (the repository for genomic sequence data) has a specific format for binary representation of DNA sequence data. Most genomic analysis programs use GenBank sequence format now (some use EMBL which is similar) and probably will in the future. Thus, the half byte per GATC symbol is defined as convention, not by the fewest binary digits neccesary for encoding them. It may waste bandwidth but that's no problem for fiber optics. Which is how this thread started.
This brings up an interesting topic. There are four classes of DNA: Foldback DNA, highly repetitive DNA, middle-repetitive DNA and single-copy DNA. Foldback DNA consists of palindromic sequences which form hairpin like structures. Highly repetitive DNA is made up of short sequences from several to hundreds of bases long (repeated around 5 x 10^5 times). Middle repetitive DNA consists of longer sequences, hundreds or thousands of bases long (these appear hundreds of times in the genome). Single-copy DNA sequences are usually genes themselves, of which (in humans) it is estimated that there are around 1 x 10^5.
Since the genome is highly redundant (in mammals up to 60% of the genome is repetitive sequence), you could probably compress alot of it just by designating symbols for specific repetitive elements. Most of the repetitive nature of the genome is found as highly repetitive sequence localized as
tandem arrays (not in introns). However, a second class of element known as SINEs and LINEs are found in introns, gene flanking regions and intergenic regions. The most widely characterized SINE is the Alu sequence, which is approximately 300 bases long and scattered throughout the genome over 5 x 10^5 times. This constitutes 5-6% of the genome! That's a lot of I often wonder if the redundancy is a way to encrypt a species genome, thus keeping different species from genetic communication. The "key" being millions of random base pairings which allow like species to decrypt their own genetic code and successfully have progeny. Pairings between species that are too
dissimilar would be a refractory event because the key is not homologous. By the way, genes are made up of exons and introns.

Once again encryption is on the minds of the business community. In the Nov. 22 issue of business week, Carl Ellison is highlighted along with Whitfield
Diffie in an article which asserts that those of us once considered paranoid
are soon to be considered prescient. Excerpts from the article:
I will venture to say that paranoid (in this context) will soon be synonymous  with cautious.
It would be interesting if the gov't ended up with a cryptography system
that has a back door and everyone else had a secure system. Fun with reversal of fortune.
Finally, Whitfield Diffie's quote, "Clipper is the most rancid idea to come along in quite some time".
As the pendulum swings further toward freedom to encrypt, it's going to take
ever more of us to keep it there. Teach anyone who will learn so the pendulum
rests on many shoulders. Also here is my Cypherpunks ID Key, I swear that it belongs to the nym my mom gave me and who signed this message, when a better verification method presents itself I will avail myself of it.

@_subject: Traffic analysis and file size 
There has been some list discussion about defeating traffic analysis of remailers by altering the incoming and outgoing size of the files. But is this not accomplished by merely encrypting with the remailers public key?
Assuming it is an encryption supporting remailer that is. When the file size changes as PGP encryption is stripped off it and the files are not sent out in the exact same order as they arrive, would it not be very difficult to ascertain that file of size X enters a remailer and emerges as size X-y. Or
can one easily deduce y from PGP's parameters? Even if y is easily deduced this problem can be overcome.
I have used various layers of compression utilities and encryption to change message size so that as the first layer of encryption is stripped off, the file is then in a File.zip state. This is then unzipped revealing another
encrypted message with an address header. Upon being sent to the next series of remailers this same course of events could then be replicated ad nauseum. Combine this strategy with file stuffers and one would likely have a hell of a time trying to match incoming/outgoing file sizes and where they originated from/are going to. Granted this is a pain, but it would seem that automation could easily be implemented.

I have been on the list for only 2 months now and I must say I enjoy the
communication. Yes, there is alot of noise that comes thru the list but alot of
it could be eliminated by not CC: to the list and communicating privately with
those who have posted information of interest to you. I find alot of the back
and forth communication annoying. Perhaps, if one notes something of interest to them from the list, they should communicate more with those who write them and evince interest in that subject and less with the list. I have found that
when I see something I like on the list (it is usually a first posting) and
contact that person directly they are very gracious and glad to help me out.
I'm not particularly technisavvy yet, but when I have asked people directly for
some pointer to information so that I can then go out and learn about it myself
(rather then expecting them to educate me), they respond very positively. Also,
those who do not think that there is a crypto-movement should hope that there
is, otherwise they may soon find themselves outlaws of a much higher level.
This is just my two cents, and sorry for the noise but I've seen a bit too much
negativism posted lately to allow myself to remain silent.

recipient of PGP encoded messages which look like this:
PGP gives me an error message if I try to decrypt this ciphertext. However, if
I edit the ciphertext beforehand (connecting the two truncated lines) , the
ciphertext can be decrypted. Is this just a glitch in the transmission? What
would cause a text line to be disrupted onto two lines? I suppose it could
occur during downloading or when it is sent thru the NET. My friend uses MacPGP
2.3. This has happened the last two times I have gotten my buddies messages.
Any ideas as to what the possible causes of this simple glitch could be? Thanks.

@_subject: Problems of anonymous posts 
Continueing in the discussion that Hal recently posted:
Having received from Karl (using my own identity) some digicash strings to use as postage for his remailer, I know that my reputation, while using his remailer, is on the line (if he knows that I have these particular strings, I assume he does). This innovation suggests a method for implimenting a postive reputation scheme. One may apply to the operators of remailers for an initial
allotment of digicash to use as postage using a digital psuedonym and signature. The initial allotment would be a small number of strings. If the strings are used responsibly, then the person could reapply and receive more strings. Irresponsible use would result in refusal to grant postage and thus limit access to the remailer system. There does seem to be a problem with the concept of pseudoanonymous positive reputations; that is, how to prevent someone from establishing an endless string of digital identities to use irresponsibly? This problem is limited by granting a small number of postage strings at first, thus forcing the person to frequently discard and establish identities as he trashed them, but this nuisance may be only partially inhibitory.
The digital signature of a pseudonym would be required to be displayed at posts. Complaints about irresponsible use could then be attributed to a pseudonym, enough complaints would result in revocation of postage and denial of reapplication for postage.
Unfortunately, this places quite a burden on those who run remailers as they
would have to be the ones who decide what posts are acceptable and unacceptable (as well as hearing about an awful lot of stupid crap). But, it does have the effect of: 1) limiting unacceptable use of remailers 2) establishing a positive reputation (which could be used at other remailers)
3) maintaining anonymity
4) inhibiting endless strings of pseudonyns to be used bogusly (although not    eliminating the possibility)
The major problem in my mind is the undue burden placed on remailer operators.
However, there must be some clever folks out there who can figure out a way to
help out in this regard.
Also, could someone point me to some information about the IP bouncers Hal mentioned? Thanks.

@_subject: Lock Out 
Well, I must say I was jarred from dozing this morning by Tim's post that the Clipper proposal is a done deal. I suppose I have always realized this but never allowed it to percolate up into my conscious. Executive fiat does have
it's disadvantages doesn't it. Then irdial-discs (what the hell are irdail-
discs?) wrote about battling Clipper on the economic front. On the face of it
this would seem to be impossible. A gov't subsidized technology has too many advantages due to subsidy, mandates etc., right?
Kind of. We all know that the U.S. Gov't has backed all manner of winning
projects in the past. Take synthetic fuels for example, truly a master stroke in economic development of a technology. The problem? The market
although artificially inflated at the time couldn't sustain a price needed
to allow cost effective synth-fuel development, Gov't or not. The Gov't
will pay for expensive chips, maybe even big Corporations can be forced to
at first. But, if a cheaper, easier alternative is available, well then, we'll
see how long VLSI & Mycotronix will make chips while bleeding red ink. Gov't
absorbing development costs, yes, but direct subsidy, I don't think so.
How can we make them bleed, then? Let's take Microsoft's strategy to them.
Here I differ in opinion with irdial. The way Microsoft dominates the market
(while putting out a sub-standard operating system to boot, sorry couldn't help it) is to package it's software as a bundle with the purchase of a piece
of hardware. You get the computer, you get DOS-Windows, FREE (sort of). What
are you gonna use? The hardware manufacturer pays a fee per computer, Microsoft makes money, the computer seller gets to offer "free" software and everybody's happy. Except the purveyors of good operating systems because they
are locked out. What if a software version of PGP was bundled with modems and
soundblaster cards? I know I got a modem communications program with my modem,
still use it too. The software version of voicePGP (The Voice of Freedom!)
would still make money for it's designer (presumably prz) and lock out clipper (alot more expensive). Anyone with a computer and modem can use PGP
thru their phone!
One could even market it as the guerilla product on the NET, now available
when you buy your modem from us, VoicePGP. Just hook your phone thru the computer and speak without Gov't interfence or fear of intrusion. I think using sharp market principles crushes tawdry Gov't "programs". Microsoft has
a great strategy, let's use it on Crippler. I also think software is the way to go, easier, cheaper and more dynamic. Hopefully, the Gov't won't be able to outlaw other crypto fast enough. Speed is crucial, Phil. If modem and soundcard manufacturers can be persuaded to bundle voicePGP with their hardware, the Gov't could well be LOCKED OUT. That's nice.

Below is the information NCSA/EIT sent me about S-HTTP, you can skip the press
release at the end if you have already read it. It was posted to the list a
short while ago.
Vaccinia at UNCVX1.oit.unc.edu
Thank you for your inquiry regarding Secure HTTP.  This message
provides some details on the protocol and the status of its
The April 12th joint EIT/NCSA/RSA press release regarding Secure
Mosaic is included at the end of the message.
OVERVIEW OF S-HTTP
We have developed a new protocol for dealing with a wide range of
cryptographic modes and algorithms in the context of the World-Wide
Web, based on the Web's existing HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
We call this protocol "Secure HTTP" or "S-HTTP".  This protocol has
been designed to enable incorporation of various cryptographic message
format standards into Web clients and servers, including, but not
limited to PKCS-7, PEM, and PGP. S-HTTP supports interoperation among
a variety of implementations, and is backwards compatible with HTTP.
S-HTTP aware clients can talk to S-HTTP oblivious servers and
vice-versa, although such transactions obviously would not use S-HTTP
security features.
IMPLEMENTATIONS AND LICENSING
EIT will make available freely usable source code for implementing
S-HTTP in both clients and servers. These reference implementations of
"Secure NCSA Mosaic" and "Secure NCSA HTTPD" will support two crypto
engine implementations: via an integrated TIPEM library (offering
PKCS-7 support) and via an "outboard" RIPEM application. RSA has
agreed to permit the distribution of their TIPEM library, in binary
form, without charge in conjunction with the non-commercial
distribution of NCSA Mosaic.  Implementors of non-commercial clients
or servers may wish to use the already available RIPEM system (which
is itself based on RSA's RSAREF library).  Commercial implementors or
distributors of WWW clients and servers are encouraged to pursue
licencing arrangements with RSA or their licencees.
FEATURES OF S-HTTP
S-HTTP does not require client-side public key certificates (or public
keys), supporting a symmetric session key operation mode. This is
significant because it means that secure, spontaneous transactions can
occur without requiring individual users to have an established public
key.  While S-HTTP will be able to take advantage of a ubiquitious
certification infrastructure, its deployment does not require it.
S-HTTP supports end-to-end secure transactions, in contrast with
current usage of the existing HTTP authorization protocol which
requires the client to attempt access and be denied before the
security mechanism is employed.  Clients may be "primed" to initiate a
secure transaction (typically using information supplied in an HTML
anchor); this is used to support encryption of fill-out forms, for
example. In S-HTTP, no sensitive data need ever be sent over the
network in the clear.
S-HTTP provides full flexibility of cryptographic algorithms, modes and
parameters. Option negotiation is used to allow clients and servers to
agree on transaction modes (should the the request be signed? encrypted?
both? what about the reply?); cryptographic algorithms (RSA vs. DSA for
signing, DES vs. RC4 for encrypting, etc.); and certificate selection
(please sign with your "Mastercard certificate").
ABOUT PKCS-7
PKCS-7 is a cryptographic message syntax standard developed by a
consortium of companies lead by RSA.  PKCS-7 is compatible with the
Internet standards for Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) in that signed-data
and signed-and-enveloped-data content, constructed in a PEM-compatible
mode, can be converted into PEM messages without any cryptographic
operations.  PEM messages can similarly be converted into the PKCS-7
signed-data and signed-and-enveloped-data content types.  In other
words, PKCS-7 and PEM implementations can interoperate.
PKCS-7 has the following advantages:
a) PKCS-7 permits transport of 8-bit data (contrast with PEM, which
requires Base-64 encoding).
b) PKCS-7 can have a signature-less mode of operation. This permits secure
messages to be sent from senders who do not have RSA key pairs.  Signature
is mandatory under PEM.
c) PKCS-7 permits more flexibility in certificate format and trust models.
d) PKCS-7 is explicitly designed for algorithmic flexibility.  New
cryptosystems, message digest algorithms and signature schemes can be added
just by defining new types.
An "alpha quality" implementation of Secure Mosaic and HTTPD was
demonstrated in public on April 12th.
The protocol document is to be sent for external review (to RSA, NCSA
and TIS) at the end of April. After revision, we plan to submit it as
an "experimental protocol" RFC -- by late May, we expect.
The reference implementation will be supplied to beta testers (to the
protocol reviewers, and selected CommerceNet sponsors). Public release
(to CommerceNet participants) is scheduled for September. CommerceNet
will operate a certification authority, suitable for operators of
S-HTTP servers (open to CommerceNet participants), beginning at that
We expect that NCSA will make the reference implementation available
to the Internet community soon after.
Periodic progress reports will be reported to Internet mailing lists
(such as PEM-DEV), and available on the EIT and CommerceNet Web
servers (URL's  and ORIGINAL PRESS RELEASE
Secure NCSA Mosaic Establishes Necessary Framework for
Electronic Commerce on the Internet
PALO ALTO, Calif., April 12, 1994 -- Enterprise Integration
Technologies (EIT), the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois and RSA Data
Security today announced agreements to jointly develop and distribute
a secure version of NCSA Mosaic, the popular point-and-click interface
that enables easy access to thousands of multimedia information
services on the Internet.
The announcement was made in conjunction with the launch of
CommerceNet, a large-scale market trial of electronic commerce on the
Internet. Under the agreements, EIT will integrate its Secure-HTTP
software with public key cryptography from RSA into NCSA Mosaic
Clients and World Wide Web (WWW) servers.  WWW is a general-purpose
architecture for information retrieval comprised of thousands of
computers and servers that is available to anyone on Internet. The
enhancements will then be made available to NCSA for widespread public
distribution and commercial licensing.
Jay M. Tenenbaum, chief executive officer of EIT, believes secure
NCSA Mosaic will help unleash the commercial potential of the Internet
by enabling buyers and sellers to meet spontaneously and transact
"While NCSA Mosaic makes it possible to browse multimedia catalogs, view
product videos, and fill out order forms, there is currently no
commercially safe way to consummate a sale," said Tenenbaum.  "With
public key cryptography, however, one can authenticate the identity
of trading partners so that access to sensitive information can be
properly accounted for."
This secure version of NCSA Mosaic allows users to affix digital
signatures which cannot be repudiated and time stamps to contracts so
that they become legally binding and auditable.  In addition,
sensitive information such as credit card numbers and bid amounts can
be securely exchanged under encryption. Together, these capabilities
provide the foundation for a broad range of financial services,
including the network equivalents of credit and debit cards, letters
of credit and checks.  In short, such secure WWW software enables
all users to safely transact day-to-day business involving even their
most valuable information on the Internet.
According to Joseph Hardin, director of the NCSA group that developed
NCSA Mosaic, over 50,000 copies of the interface software are being
downloaded monthly from NCSA's public server -- with over 300,000
copies to date. Moreover, five companies have signed license
agreements with NCSA and announced plans to release commercial
products based on NCSA Mosaic.
"This large and rapidly growing installed base represents a vast,
untapped marketplace," says Hardin. The availability of a secure
version of NCSA Mosaic establishes a valid framework for companies to
immediately begin large-scale commerce on the Internet."
Jim Bidzos, president of RSA, sees the agreement as the beginning of a
new era in electronic commerce, where companies routinely transact
business over public networks.
"RSA is proud to provide the enabling public key software technology
and will make it available on a royalty-free basis for inclusion in
NCSA's public distribution of NCSA Mosaic," said Bidzos.  RSA and EIT
will work together to develop attractive licensing programs for
commercial use of public key technology in WWW servers."
At the CommerceNet launch, Allan M. Schiffman, chief technical officer
of EIT, demonstrated a working prototype of secure NCSA Mosaic, along
with a companion product that provides for a secure WWW server. The
prototype was implemented using RSA's TIPEM toolkit.
"In integrating public key cryptography into NCSA Mosaic, we took
great pains to hide the intricacies and preserve the simplicity and
intuitive nature of NCSA Mosaic," explained Schiffman.
Any user that is familiar with NCSA Mosaic should be able to
understand and use the software's new security features.  Immediately
to the left of NCSA's familiar spinning globe icon, a second icon has
been inserted that is designed to resemble a piece of yellow paper.
When a document is signed, a red seal appears at the bottom of the
paper, which the user can click on to see the public key certificates
of the signer and issuing agencies.  When an arriving document is
encrypted, the paper folds into a closed envelope, signifying that its
information is hidden from prying eyes.  When the user fills out a
form containing sensitive information, there is a 'secure send' button
that will encrypt it prior to transmission.
Distribution of Public Keys
To effectively employ public-key cryptography, an infrastructure must
be created to certify and standardize the usage of public key
certificates.  CommerceNet will certify public keys on behalf of
member companies, and will also authorize third parties such as banks,
public agencies, industry consortia to issue keys.  Such keys will
often serve as credentials, for example, identifying someone as a
customer of a bank, with a guaranteed credit line.  Significantly, all
of the transactions involved in doing routine purchases from a catalog
can be accomplished without requiring buyers to obtain public keys.
Using only the server's public key, the buyer can authenticate the
identity of the seller, and transmit credit card information securely
by encrypting it under the seller's public key.  Because there are far
fewer servers than clients, public key administration issues are
greatly simplified.
Easy Access to Strong Security
To successfully combine simplicity of operation and key administration
functions with a high level of security that can be accessible to even
non-sophisticated users, significant changes were necessary for
existing WWW security protocols.  EIT developed a new protocol called
Secure-HTTP for dealing with a full range of modern cryptographic
algorithms and systems in the Web.
Secure-HTTP enables incorporation of a variety of cryptographic
standards, including, but not limited to, RSA's PKCS-7, and Internet
Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM), and supports maximal interoperation
between clients and servers using different cryptographic algorithms.
Cryptosystem and signature system interoperation is particularly
useful between U.S.  residents and non-U.S. residents, where the
non-U.S. residents may have to use weaker 40-bit keys in conjunction
with RSA's RC2 (TM) and RC4 (TM) variable keysize ciphers.  EIT
intends to publish Secure-HTTP as an Internet standard, and work with
others in the WWW community to create a standard that will encourage
using the Web for a wide variety of commercial transactions.
EIT will make Secure NCSA Mosaic software available at no charge to
CommerceNet members in September and NCSA will incorporate these
secure features in future NCSA Mosaic releases.

@_subject: VAX remailer? 
I have recently come into possesion of a VAX account which I would like to run a remailer thru. I have gotten a variety of code from soda which I have little comprehension of. Does hal's instructions contain instructions
in ASCII? Mine don't seem to. Other remailers seem to only work on UNIX  machines. Our VAX has VMAIL and, I guess, VMSMAIL. If someone could tell me
if it is possible to run a remailer out of a VAX account (no root) and steer me toward some code that has instructions on how to set it up, it would be nice. I am a bit clueless on this so some tutoring might be needed. I do have access to various compilers. Please respond by private mail, if I can get this going I'll let you all know.

@_subject: VMS remailer? 
For people wanting to get more remailers going there seems to be a serious apathy for helping people get them going. After posting that I had come into possesion of a VAX account from which I might run a remailer and then asking for some help, I got all of ZERO responses (except from people asking me to help them if I did manage to get any information). Since I had already checked out the available code which only seems to work on UNIX accounts, perhaps someone might inform me that one cannot run a remailer from a VMS account. I
assume this is the case since no one deigned to answer. Pretty bogus.

@_subject: Mail-Future Free Remailers 
In actuality having only purely commercial remailers in a chain would likely
lead to security concerns of the following nature. When remailers end up requiring postage, people will tend to use the cheapest remailers to cut down on costs. Who will be in a position to offer the cheapest rates under a commercial proposition? Someone who has deep pockets, perhaps? An entity that
really doesn't rely on profit to stay in business? Our own governmental TLA's
could attract much remailer traffic by offering unbeatable prices (with our own taxes), even a modest price edge skews traffic in their favor.
This speaks highly for the "every man a remailer" concept. If you know people who run remailers and trust that they are not compromised, a mix of commercial and philanthropic remailers may actually be the most secure chain of remailers
to use. One could then safely use the price edge of the commercial remailers and the advanced features they offer and at the same time thwart the TLA planted remailers attempts to trace traffic (at least ideally). This could be done by inserting personally trusted philanthropic remailers into the chain in strategic places. Hal has been mentioning such strategic placement of remailers which is very interesting indeed.

I have been having quite a bit of difficulty with my encrypted drive mangling
files. After getting secure drive 1.3d installed on my hard drive, I find that various files are being corrupted and many times after accessing the drive a bunch of crosslinked files are present. The TSR was being loaded into high memory (login /s was included in my autoexec.bat and safe mode was on after the boot); I use Novell DOS 7.0. I had to uninstall the encryption on the drive and am thinking of trying Secure Device to see if the problem persists.
Has anyone had any problems such as this? Any suggestions would be welcome as
I desire to keep PGP on the encrypted drive. Encrypted floppies do not seem to be a problem (good thing I keep an encrypted floppy backup of my PGP files :-) Does anyone know where I can get a utility to decompress the secdevice.arj
file? Is it the same as .arc files? Thanks.

I wrote about a possible trapdoor in Skipjack to which Perry replied:
How true, yet the NSA also had a lot to lose by putting out a flawed backdoor in Skipjack which essentially negates much of this features (LEAF)
value. They did so none the less. In addition, I remember the comments of Stuart Baker; the audacity was typical of an organization which would
put in just such a hole and smugly disbelieve that anyone would find out.
In addition, it is possible that the agency is not alarmed about their LEAF
problems because they don't need to use it. Of course, even if the whole
algorithm was compromised I don't think they would show alarm outwardly. The possibilty is still there.
Since one does not know the Skipjack design, a belief that it does not contain a trapdoor is without evidence and also a supposition. My contention
is that the NSA is cocky enough to disregard the consequences of putting
holes in Skipjack. Me neither, and randomly generating new LEAF fields would not give me comfort as to the security of my transmissions. Which is the main point
here in my mind.

Perry responding to one of the points I made Said:
I do not contend this, I contend they were negligent in checking their work.
That they were lax in their standards and that this lackadaisical attitude bespeakes arrogance. An arrogance that would allow them to think that they COULD put in a trapdoor (besides the LEAF) in Skipjack and easily get away with it.
It would be in the NSA's self interest to have there own little door into Skipjack, wouldn't you say? Especially when the agency is quite satisfied that no one knows their algorithm. I don't see the evidence you are operating on, but will grant you the self interest part I mentioned above.
Well, they did say so. But, I did agree with the play down mistakes position in the last post.

Request-Remailing-To: rperkins at nyx.cs.du.edu
Request-Remailing-To: nowhere at bsu-cs.bsu.edu
Request-Remailing-To: vaccinia at uncvx1.oit.unc.edu
The preceding remailer message path was generated using Hal's Chain utility. One can find this program at soda.berkeley.edu pub/cypherpunks/remailer, get Chain.zip. It automates alot of the drudge in chaining remailers. It will even encode messages using PGP if you have the remailers public key on your ring and your PGP directory in your path statement. For instance, to get the above remailer path I typed the following:
chain vaccinia at uncvx1.oit.unc.edu vox rperkins nowhere  foo.vox
Thus my address will be the final destination, the message file (foo.let) is converted to the remail ready file, foo.vox. The remail ready file must then be manually sent to the first remailer in the chain, in this case remail at vox.hacktic.nl. It will then go to rperkins at nyx.cs.du.edu and then to
nowhere at bsu-cs.bsu.edu, finally being sent to vaccinia at uncvx1.oit.unc.edu. The Chain.ini file (from the chain.zip file) contains the remailer addresses and whether a PGP public key for the remailer is available on your public key ring. Remailers for which you have keys will automatically be encoded and begin thusly:
Encrypted: PGP
N.B., It may be neccesary to edit the chain.ini file (it is merely an ASCII file) to update the list of remailers. I recommend this utility for chaining
to most remailers. Remember that remailer at soda.berkeley.edu does not support the format,     ::

@_subject: clipper + enaction = illegal alternate encryption 
This is the reason all other forms of encryption will be outlawed if the
clipper proposal goes through. I foresee at least two lines of enforcement.
The first is that one is held in contempt of court (assuming they can find some charges to press) until you give them your key. How long can they keep you in the slammer on a contempt charge? This option is already available and seems to work, at least so far. The second is to make alternate encryption illegal and thus they will get you even if they have no evidence to charge you with. After all, if the police are monitering you AND you are encrypting information, you must be guilty, right? Encryption will be enough evidence to convict. This makes life easy for law enforcement and will surely be the next step after clipper. If they can't
get you for the alleged crime you are committing then use of illegal encryption will provide a consolation prize. They really HAVE to make alternate forms of encryption illegal to make clipper of any value to them,
despite the rhetoric we are now hearing (at least some people are hearing).

@_subject: Clipper Cracks Appear 
Seeing as it is politics week here at cpunks, I have found some interesting  comments from our friends at whitehouse.gov. Commentary by John Carey in BusinessWeek Magazine (Big Brother Could Hobble High Tech, 3/24/94 pg. 37) states that:    So why is the Whitehouse pushing the retrograde notions? One reason is the Clintonites fear of appearing soft on crime and terrorism. "No one wants the
head of the FBI walking around saying: 'I don't have the tools to do my job'"
says Bellsouth's Markey.
   Things aren't entirely bleak. The administration, taken aback by vehement opposition from industry, congress and civil libertarians, is suggesting it may back off. "People are willing to work things out" says White House  Staff secretary John D. Podesta, who is involved in technology issues. FBI
director Freeh says he's willing to accept higher hurdles to get court appointed surveilence. And there are tantalizing hints that the white house
is reconsidering its hard line on the clipper chip. Seems that we are having an effect and cracks are starting to leak compromise from the Gov't. This is, however, just the beginning. A ploy used successfully by many groups (New York city's transit authority are masters at this) is to put forth an outrageous proposal, such as clipper etc. Then they soften the demands so that the opponent becomes disarmed, allowing that which the Gov't had intended to pass all along to go through as a compromise.
This cannot be allowed. Time to step up the attack a notch. Write the  whitehouse and ask them if they want to go down in history as the presidency
that ushered in the era of Big Brother. I know Bill won't read it but someone has to. Keep on your congresscritters (I like that word) and put stuff in your local paper. Arm the populace. Lastly, I think many of you are giving
this countries people less credit than they deserve. Many simple men and women
founded this country. Try not to be so pompous.

@_subject: Profiles and DTII 
I would like to offer up a scenario which I have heard allusions to, but has not been concretely spelled out. It is admittedly farfetched, but not out of the realm of possibility. Imagine a room full of Cray XMP's running an AI program developed ala FinCen, NSA etc. This program can obtain "setup" information (because DTII has passed) without need for even a warrant. The program detects certain patterns of information transfer (phone, Net, whatever) that it deems suspicious. Suspects are then "explored" further. What kind of computing power would it take to implement complete survailence
on say, Washington, D.C.?
This system is very similar to how law enforcement agents now patrol the nations highways. People fitting a certain profile are detained by the police,
and searched. Has it been determined if such search and seizures are legal?
I recently wrote to NBC to inform them of what the detection of their calling patterns (in real time) could mean to the confidentiality of their sources. How many people would commit sensitive information to the media knowing that they could be easily monitered? It should be constantly pointed out to the media that they have a great deal to lose by passage of DTII, Clipper et al.
The information exchange business could easily be coerced by Gov't in the near
future. Just a few ramblings I wanted to get off my chest.

Matthew Ghio wrote about a gedanken experiment in breaking DES:
See "Efficient DES Key Search" by Micheal J. Weiner, Bell-Northern Research,
P.O. Box 3511 Station C, Ottawa, Ontario, K1Y4H7, Canada.
Abstract.  Despite recent improvements in analytic techniques for attacking the Data Encryption Standard (DES), exhaustive key search remains the most
practical and efficient attack. Key search is becoming alarmingly practical.
We show how to build an exhaustive DES key search machine for $1 million that
can find a key in 3.5 hours on average. The design for such a machine is described in detail for the purpose of assessing the resistance of DES to an exhaustive attack. This design is based on mature technology to avoid making
guesses about future capabilities.
This manuscript is available by FTP but I don't remember where, does anyone else? At least for a known-plaintext attack, specially designed hardware of the type described in the paper is, indeed, much faster. The author mentions the prudence of using DES in triple-encryption mode. I like BIG keys.

@_subject: List Down? 
Could someone tell me if the list is down? I have'nt gotten any mail for the past two days. Perhaps, a router into our site is down? Anyway, if it is the list and not my node, I would at least have a better fix on what is happening. Thanks.

@_subject: PGP 2.6 incompatibilities 
First I would like to say that Mr. Bailey is being taken (should have recanted
while you had a chance), that being said, it is worth it to get someone to examine the code in a thorough manner. I'll ante up $10 to help alleviate the pain of losing this bet, Mr Bailey. Only good things can come of such a bet in my opinion. Perhaps, the above code analysis will present some new insights into patches and maybe even improvements!         Someone wrote the list to say that the RSAREF code in 2.5 is not as good as Phil's, MIT seems to agree since it now has implimented new RSA code "while you wait". I'm not using this new code unless the type of patch Adam Shostack has suggested is implemented, that is, it is fully compatible with previous (i.e. 2.3, 2.3a, 2.4) versions. This attempt at divide and conquer cannot be allowed. I would like to use a PGP which does not violate intellectual property rights (no matter the shaky legal patent grounds, at least here in the U.S.), but I'm not willing to use an "us" (americans, canadians) version of PGP leaving "them" (anyone else) totally incompatible.
That just incapacitates all of us. Bring on PGP 2.6a.

@_subject: Broken PGP 2.6 
Perhaps I'm being something of a romantic, but one of the reasons that I was
drawn to PGP as an encryption system was because it was code that could be worked upon and improved by those who have bright minds. This is the reason
people use it, a product designed by many intelligent people to be the best,
using the best implementations of code that could be thought up. This latest version seems to be an attempt to derail this effort and implement a system which is a compromise that neither improves PGP nor allows further code improvement in the future (Re: Hals remarks on "hacked" versions being non-RSA approved and thus having little hope of implementation). This SUCKS, frankly. And I am not sure I can buy into PGP 2.6 in it's present form. I suppose I may be forced to, but I can't support the effort as it has so far come to pass.
RSA has had more than enough time to target infringers and afraid of their patent standing have not done so. They have coerced certain factions to fix their problems by supplying an easy alternative to their legal problems;
initiate the release of a de facto standard that doesn't violate their patents. The thing is, that if they hadn't made that one last little shove, I would have taken their alternative. I draw the line at crippling new PGP code improvements :-(
It is not rational to tilt at windmills but we have been doing so for a while
now. Rationally, it certainly is easier to just accept 2.6. A step in the right direction? I don't think so.

@_subject: Smoke & Mirrors 
A friend of mine has a business setting up networks for business's in the Baltimore area. He contracts out the security end of the setup to a firm
called "Smoke and Mirrors". They create firewalls and handle encryption
capabilities. I think the company is in the baltimore area, and was wondering if anyone on the list has heard of this company? With a name like smoke and mirrors I guess they better be good. Anybody know?
