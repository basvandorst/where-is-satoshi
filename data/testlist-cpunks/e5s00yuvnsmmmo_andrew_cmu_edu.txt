@_subject: Cypherpunks investigated, FOIA? 
Have the cypherpunks requested data on whether they are being investigated
 by the same agencies under the FOIA individually or as a group listed by
 that name? If so, what are the results, if any, so far?
Does anyone know if this has been done? The FOIA, that is.
