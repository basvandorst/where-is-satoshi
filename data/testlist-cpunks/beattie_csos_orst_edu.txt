I disagree, one can use e-mail to steal.  E-mail consumes resources,
resources for which the sender may have no right to use.  If the sender
is sending messages which the recipient does not wish to receive then
his resources are being taken.  If the recipient has now way of stopping
the messages then the recipients resources are being taken against the
recipient's will and the recipient should be able to have the messages
stopped before they consume the recipients resources.

I must assume that the actor who spams me or sends me unsolicited
email or any email for that matter derives some benifit from this activity or they would not do it.
If I make it clear that I do not wish to receive email from an individual
or group and that individual or group continues to send email then I contend
that they are using my resources in a way that I have not authorized.
clearly I disagree.
