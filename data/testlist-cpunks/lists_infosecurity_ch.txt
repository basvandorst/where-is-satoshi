@_subject: [tor-talk] Automatic vulnerability scanning of Tor Network? 
Yes, i agree, we can find a common point.
We just all need to move in the same direction, with conflicts and
constructive criticism, but in the same direction.
Let's try to sketch down on a etterpad or trac ticket an idea on how to
implement something like this in order to:
- evaluating and pushing hardening of system/network security of Tor nodes
- avoid/mitigate alerts and risks for Tor Operators
That way we can try to match the needs perceived by all different
parties, balancing the risk/return of the initiative.
I'm gonna dump in this email a set of useful links collected during
browsing to do that.
We are probably not interested in Nessus & Metasploit AutoPwn, but it's
important to know that anyone can just aggregate everything into a chain
of automatic portscanning + vulnerability scanning + vulnerability

@_subject: [liberationtech] Namecoin: secure, 
Hi all,
i encountered such a project called Namecoin: Namecoin  is a peer-to-peer *generic*
name/value datastore system based on Bitcoin technology (a decentralized cryptocurrency). It allows you to:
  * Securely register and transfer arbitrary names, *no possible
    censorship!*
  * Attach values to the names (up to 1023 bytes)
  * Trade and transact namecoins, the digital currency *NMC*.
There's also a proposal to use NameCoin for naming system for Tor
 .
I am wondering if this system has been already seriously considered as a
resilient human readable crypto naming system for other crypto and anti
censorship projects, as it seems quite promising but i didn't get deeper
Any opinion?

@_subject: [liberationtech] Cellcrypt? 
I work since 2006 as a CTO for a company competitor of Cellcrypt
It's a proprietary encryption technology, not subject to auditing to
anyone other than government customers.
It follow a "legacy" technological approach to cryptography by
leveraging secrecy, that's something in the culture of military
encryption technologies.
There are existing IETF standard protocols to satisfy almost any VoIP
encryption needs and a wide range of software (opensource/commercial,
desktop/mobile) that let you do encrypted phone calls on different
security model (end-to-end vs. end-to-site).
You can read an overview of most voice encryption related security
protocols (proprietary and non-proprietary) with a bit of history on
I consider Snake-Oil [1] any approach that doesn't use:
- open standards
- open code (at least for encryption)
As my personal effort for transparency i managed the release of
implementation of cryptographic modules on  .
Additionally you should pay attention to protect the SIGNALING, as the
phone-call-logs analysis could provide a worst impact on user privacy
than the content of a conversation.
Almost any interception goes before with an analysis of the
phone-call-logs (CDR) in order to detect targets in a communication
social network.
SIP/TLS (SIP over TLS) provide that kind of protection.
If you use a DHE capable SIP client, you can achieve also Perfect
Forward Secrecy protection for signaling (as long as you don't keep log
on server).

@_subject: [liberationtech] Chinese preparing for a "Autonomous Internet" ? 
Hi all,
i wanted to notice that there is a new internet draft in IETF that
should make us think on the chinese government respect strategies to
internet governance issues.
DNS Extension for Autonomous Internet(AIP)
This proposal by China Telecom, China Mobile & Guangdong Commercial
College propose.
Even if we know that "root servers" are very well distributed across the
world / countries trough a collaborative system, chinese see this as a
"central control".
"  But its central control
   method is not suitable to autonomy and scalability and can't keep up
   with the fast development of Internet. To national internet network,
   owning its independent root DNS server and realize autonomy in
   Internet is a problem not only for the cost but also for the
   technical difficulty. It is almost impossible in current DNS
   architecture."
  "In order to realize the transition from Internet to Autonomous
   Internet, each partition of current Internet should first realize
   possible self-government and gradually reduce its dependence on the
   foreign domain names, such as COM, NET et al."
So basically the chinese play is not of being part of a collaborative
internet, but driving strategically the direction to become an
independent island in the world.

@_subject: [liberationtech] Silent Circle Dangerous to Cryptography 
I run that kind of mobile voice crypto business since 2006, had worked
with Phil on our Board of Advisor, but i basically have not much trust
in the "SAAS" business model for that kind of stuff, given my own
personal experience.
When i meet customers (mostly Enterprises and Governments, ONG get it
for free), the big obstacle is not the technology but is the "trust".
SilentCircle have worked a lot on the concept of "Trust" by having
trustful people on-board, however i do think that who really need
communication encryption support, normally doesn't have the skills to
evaluate and understand how a technology or security mechanism works.
As written on
 at lists.stanford.edu/msg00446.html,
i tried in past to run and market a service for mobile voice encryption,
but there was always one question from customers:
"So, all my phone calls goes trough your systems?"
After that question, from a commercial point of view, for Enterprise &
Government customers, represented a dead-end.
So now, like CryptoPhone and other companies doing voice crypto, i had
to provide that stuff only with in-house server for customers.
Still i would be very happy if SilentCircle realize a marketing model
where they can have customers interested to use their service!
We need more innovation that field, we need opensource and free
products, commercial products, software as a service products:
At the end we it's just important that what you get from a community,
you provide it back to the community!
Yeah, when i spoke with Nicolas from Calyx he showed me the same US law.
US Law is *extremely better* than EU Directive on the same topic, as in
EU is not specifically considered and as long as you are an "Electronic
communication service provider" you are obliged to provide assistance
and cooperation with "Lawful interception" requirements mandated by
ETSI-LI and further.
If you do provide the encryption tools along with the "electronic
communication service", it's your clear intention and goals to put
yourself in a condition that will not let you respect the lawful
interception legal requirements.  So your basically violating the law.
The only way is to work on the concept of what is an "electronic
communication service", as we did (at privatewave).
Here you can find our legal and technical analysis on how to run a voice
encryption services in Italy (EU) not representing an "electronic
communication service"
I don't think that this could practically happen, basically due to the
liability and trust risks that Google or Apple would incur.
Given their stock market capitalization, their CFO would never permit
something like that, and for that reason i consider Apple or Google
store the most secure software delivery method even, there are too many
interests to get this backdoored :-)

@_subject: [tor-talk] Porn make the world more free: Tor Porn Bundle? 
i've been at internet governance forum (in italy) yesterday and
starteddiscussing a topic with several internet freedom/policy activists:
"porn make the world more free"
It seems a joke, but it maybe an important consideration.
A teenager (12-18 yo) in 2012 use internet porn websites for masturbation.
That's a real facts, i expect, almost everywhere.
In places like Saudi, a 14th years old young have a strong need of
masturbate like in any other place in the world.
But he don't have access to internet porn with his broadband internet
In the Saudi example there are already now people providing paid (and
risky) access to porn for masturbation's needs:
This as an example of a real need that stimulate people in finding
circumvention methods.
So, when a teenager in Saudi need to masturbate he have to find out a
censorship circumvention tool.
Ok, how can we think to make out of it (masturbation and porn) something
good for freedom of speech?
Imho we may think to create something like "Tor Porn Bundle": A version
of TBB specifically designed to provide easy access to Porn.
Then promote it trough custom targeted campaigns across all Arab World
(and language/countries where internet porn is censored).
Which would be the main result in mid-term?
That most teenagers (and also non teenagers, but probably in minor part)
in that closed-society will learn, understand and start using censorship
circumvention tool for an important, basic need: Masturbate!
We should not underestimate the relevance of this need because it fit
along with the "Basic" human needs, like eating.
So the effort and perceived rewards that a person have working on the
path to satisfy that need is very high.
In that hypothetical Torn Porn Bundle, we may deliver a pre-populated
in-language list of porn websites.
But also some "free" "in language" media website and other free / non
censored information sources and social networking tools.
That way, after masturbation, the user will be able to have a clear and
simple path to start accessing the web in a free way.
As a side node i would like to remind that the "porn industry" is valued
billion of USD.
If porn industry would became partners of freedom of speech players, it
could means a lot of money for investment in campaigning and technology
development, because it would means opening new markets to them.
Opening a new market means having new consumer that means they would be
able to calculate the economic ROI of an investment.
* Porn supported the development of internet backbone
* Porn developed early internet multimedia streaming technologies
* Porn may make the world more free

Sure, also GlobaLeaks 0.2 is designed in a way to minimize the impact on
TorHS latency and avoid "white page effect" on user's browser.
Totally agree, especially it's absolutely reasonable that we will see a
growing number of Applications that include Tor as part of their code
and use Tor Hidden Services a unique way to communicate.
It would be very useful to have an official statement by Tor Project on
the current scalability / performance impact of Tor Hidden Service with
a Guideline to let Application Developer (bundling Tor, using TorHS)
avoid breaking/hurting the Tor Network.
That way the limits are clear and the way to be "Polite with the Network
considering it's current limitations" would be explicit.

@_subject: [tor-talk] TOR Fone - p2p secure and anonymous VoIP tool 
For my daily-for-profit-job i made in past stuff for secure telephony
over GPRS that:
- can have variable latencies on CS1 between 800ms-2200ms
- is a reliable transport (the low level of the OS does retransmissions
at GSM RLP level)
To work over high latency (and tipically also low-bandwidth) with
reliable transport (like TCP/Tor) you need to use those multimedia strategy:
- setup a large static jitter buffer (you define the added artificial
latency of the call to compensate variable latency)
- reduce transport protocol overhead by setting a large "packetization time"
- detect retransmission behaviours, in that case apply small TX cutting
With such approach you can avoid "PTT" and even if the communication
will sounds like an old analog satellite connection, it works.
