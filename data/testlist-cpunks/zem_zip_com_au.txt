Most numbers stations use shortwave broadcast or amateur bands - roughly
1-30 MHz.  Licenses are required in the country where the transmitter is
located, not elsewhere.  Shortwave stations are almost always intended for
international broadcasting.
Here's the FCC's application form for a shortwave transmitter:
"Any qualified US citizen, company, or group may apply to the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) for authority to construct and operate a
high frequency (HF) (shortwave) international broadcasting station. [...]
It should be noted that an international broadcasting station is intended
for broadcasting to a foreign country and is not intended for broadcasting
solely to the United States."
More on numbers stations here, including loggings and presumed locations
of some transmitters:
As an aside, this showed up on the spooks list a week or so back, I don't
think it made it to cypherpunks:
(Sep 22 2001)
"WASHINGTON -- FBI agents on Friday detained a 44-year-old senior analyst
with the Defense Intelligence Agency, a vital part of the U.S. national
security establishment, and charged her with providing U.S. national
secrets to Cuba.
Among the contents, it added, were instructions on how to erase material
from the computer, tips for radio reception, and references to ``the
numbers that you receive via radio.'' A short-wave radio was also found.
The complaint said that the FBI identified text consisting of 150 sets of
numerical groups.
``The text begins, `30107 24624,' and continues until 150 such groups are
listed. The FBI has determined that the precise same numbers, in the
precise same order, were broadcast on February 6, 1999, at AM frequency
7887 kHz, by a woman speaking Spanish, who introduced the broadcast with
the words `Atencisn! Atencisn!' '' the complaint said."

I have a machine with 2 gig (or thereabouts), located in Australia.
Bandwidth is low (64k ISDN) but the machine is available.
If high bandwidth is a necessity I know someone who might be able to help
depending on the content.

Sure.  Just noting that the capability is there, since it's easy to
overlook.  It works reliably in my experience.
This I don't understand.
Can you describe a scenario under which an encrypted fs is valuable enough
to justify typing one command, but not two?  OpenBSD's target audience is
not exactly clueless newbies.
Or is speed so important that you'd sacrifice security?  Any encrypted fs
will take a performance hit; I think you'll find loopback overhead is
insignificant next to the crypto.
Is booting from an encrypted fs ever useful?  Use read-only media if
tampering is a concern.  Configure and mount other encrypted filesystems
from /etc/rc.  If you can install and maintain OpenBSD, you can manage
It's worth noting their primary goal is network security, not crypto.
Rubber hoses don't factor significantly in their threat model.

2.7 had problems.  It's worked reliably for me since 2.8.  YMMV.
Sure.  Union mount the sensitive stuff over /etc as necessary.  CDs are
tamper resistant because they can be removed and carried.  Encryption is
not very useful as a tamper protection measure - it won't protect against
a DoS, or replacement of a partition with a trojan.
Encrypting system binaries is rarely useful.  It creates bootstrapping
problems and doesn't provide much benefit.  Encrypting /usr/local is
Let's take a step back - this thread started because you suggested
win2k's encrypted filesystem was more useable than openbsd's.  Now your
argument against openbsd is that it's not invisible.
Out of interest, can Windows boot from an encrypted disk?
Yes, there are many different threat models ranging from casual to
paranoia.  Neither win2k nor openbsd will satisfy the truly paranoid.  But
openbsd does have a useful encrypted filesystem.
You're welcome to whine about the loopback not being the right colour or
whatever.  Hell, I'd skip the loopback layer if I could.  In the meantime
I'll use what's available.  My /home partition is encrypted - is yours?
Encrypting data is useful.  Encrypting system binaries is of little value.

Create a loopback device.  "-k" means encrypt - cipher is blowfish,
there's no way to change it.  After vnconfig, /dev/svnd0 becomes a block
device; use newfs and mount as with any partition.
Here's the man page:
The performance hit is acceptable, it's much faster than CFS.  OpenBSD's
encrypted swap uses the same mechanism.
