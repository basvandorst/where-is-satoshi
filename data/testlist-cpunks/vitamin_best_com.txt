I apologize if this is off topic.
I received free one month trial in July from Netcom and in mid July I
canceled my account with
Netcom due to lousy customer service.  When I called I was treated rudely
because of canceling netcom.   I called again the next day and the person who answered
the phone apologized me for the behaviour of the previous employee and I was told my
account will be canceled.   Low and behold come July I got my credit card statement and netcom had billed me.  I promtly called them and was assured that my account
would be cancelled.  Come September I was billed again for August and September.  Once again I called and she assured me  it would be cancelled.   Again, it
was not.   Come October they still billed me.  In my November statement they are still
billing me.  I prefer L.A.  Better Business Bureau and District Attorney emails and
physical addresses.
Someone please help me!!!!!
Thank You

I am looking for drivers for US Robotics  for my HP Laserjet .
I've contacted theU.S. Robotics support via an e-mail. They confirmed that this
driver exists but it is available from BBS only.   Is there anyway I can access through web or ftp site?
Thanks a mil
