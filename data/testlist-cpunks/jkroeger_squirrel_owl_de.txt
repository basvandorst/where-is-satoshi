I've installed a Mixmaster/Ghio remailer combination on my
Linux machine with the address mix at squirrel.owl.de.

The Ghio remailer has the following features:
$remailer{"squirrel"} = " cpunk mix pgp hash latent cut ek"
My connection for email is via a UUCP link that is polled every two hours.
Do not expect quick turnaround of remailed messages.  List pingers
please note.  This can be a disadvantage or an advantage depending on your
needs and expectations.
Please read the help file before using the remailer.
You can get it by sending an empty mail with subject "remailer-help"
to mix at squirrel.owl.de.
I adapted and extended the original remailer help files and inserted a
section about reply blocks and pseudonyms.
C'punks, please mail questions and comments directly to me, as I'm
not subscribed to the cypherpunks list.

@_subject: Squirrel goes Mixmaster-only 
Hello remailer users!
I'm sorry, but my ISP complained that the huge mail traffic for
squirrel overloaded their servers.  Effective immediately, my remailer
accepts only Mixmaster packets and is not listed in Raph's type-1
statistics anymore.  The operation of the nym server at weasel.owl.de
is not affected.

@_subject: Squirrel Type-1 remailer is up again in PGP-only mode 
Hello remailer users!
I've solved the mail traffic problem with my provider and put
the type-1 remailer at squirrel back up.  But it will only remail
PGP-encrypted messages to reduce the convenience to spammers.
Accepting only encrypted mail should also enhance the security since
it is harder for attackers to identify which encrypted incoming mail
corresponds to which outgoing mail.
Raph, please put the Squirrel remailer
$remailer{"squirrel"} = " cpunk mix pgp hash latent cut ek"
on your list again and point out that it only accepts PGP messages.  Thanks.
If someone removed the PGP-key from their keyring,
here is it again (you can find it on the key servers too):

I apologize for the lost mails during the shutdown.

@_subject: New alias server weasel.owl.de 
I'm running the Squirrel Remailer  for some
weeks now and finally managed to install a "newnym" style alias
server (like nym.alias.net) with the hostname weasel.owl.de.
