I'm still amazed that anyone takes this proof-of-work/hashcash stuff
At best it's the "War Games" approach, let's make the server play
tic-tac-toe with itself to avoid nuclear holocaust, or the Bill
Shatner logical paradox that makes the robot's head blow up.
The Sphinx's riddle also comes to mind, works better for supernatural
beings however.
I realize the defense of the dumbest ideas is always that any
criticism can be represented as rudeness, ``how rude of you not to see
the brilliance of my ideas!'', so one goes on and on anyhow but I
wonder if there's any way to disabuse this nonsense once and for all,
particularly in the minds of those who think it's a good idea?
In the words of someone famous whose name I'll leave out of this: This
idea isn't right, why, it isn't even wrong!

Like the movie "War Games" when a young Matthew Broderick saves the
world by causing the WOPR computer to be distracted into playing
itself tic-tac-toe rather than launching a pre-emptive nuclear strike.
It was a MOVIE, made in 1983 nonetheless, get over it.
More seriously, what attracts people to this penny black idea is that
they realize that the only thing which will stop spammers is to
interject some sort of economic constraint. The obvious constraint
would be something like stamps since that's a usage fee.
But the proposer (and his/her/its audience) always hates the idea of
paying postage for their own email, no, no, there must be a solution
which performs that economic miracle of only charging for the behavior
I don't like! An economic Maxwell's demon!
So, just like the terminal seeking laetrile shots or healing waters,
they turn to not even half-baked ideas such as penny black. Don't
charge you, don't charge me, charge that fellow behind the tree!
Oh well.
Eventually email will just collapse (as it's doing) and the RBOCs et
al will inherit it and we'll all be paying 15c per message like their
SMS services.
I know, we'll work around it. Of course by then they'll have a
multi-billion dollar messaging business to make sure your attempts to
by-step it are outlawed and punished. Consider what's going on with
the music-sharing world, as another multi-billion dollar business
people thought they could just defy with anonymous peer-to-peer
The point: I think the time is long past due to "grow up" on this
issue and accept that some sort of limited, reasonable-usage-free,
postage system is necessary to prevent collapse into monopoly.

That's the big problem with all micropayment schemes. They sound good
until you try to work the business plan, then they prove themselves
impossible because it costs 2c to handle each penny. And more if
issues such as collections and enforcement (e.g., against frauds) is
taken into account.
This is why, for example, we have a postal system which manages
postage, rather than some scheme whereby every paper mail recipient
charges every paper mail sender etc etc etc.

This is why there's a need for some sort of reasonable, organized
response outlined in writing.
In my experience law enforcement (and others) will try to shift
whatever investigative tasks are convenient to them to anyone in the
Why not, it costs them nothing to have you running around all day and
night doing investigative work for them.
They will generally cite the seriousness of the underlying crime as
(bottomless) justification for your contribution.
The rational response is to sit down as a group within some framework
and come to some agreement* with them as to what is a reasonable and
sufficient response in these cases.
Otherwise you're just the complaint desk at Macy's taking all comers
and subject to whatever they can dream up to try to get you to solve
their problems.
* Agreement with LEOs is best, a unilateral document would at least
open discussion one would hope and move towards that end.

@_subject: William was raided for running a Tor exit node. Please help if 
Back in the early days of the public internet we didn't require any id
to create an account, just that you found a way to pay us. We had
anonymous accts some of whom dropped by personally to pay their bill,
some said hello but I usually didn't know their names and that's how
they wanted it, I'd answer "hello ", whatever their login was
if I recognized them. Some mailed in something, a mail order, even
currency tho that was rare but it did happen, or had someone else drop
by to pay in cash (that is, no idea if they were local.)
LEO occasionally served a warrant for information, usually child porn
biz (more than just accessing child porn, selling it) tho I don't
remember any anonymous accts being involved.
I never expected to be held accountable for anyone's behavior unless I
was knowingly involved somehow (just the usual caveat.) LEO never
showed any particular interest in the fact that we were ok with
anonymous accounts. If I was made aware of illegal activities we'd
shut them off, didn't really happen much, maybe some credible
"hacking" complaint on occasion.
It's funny, it's all illusion like show business. It's not hard to set
up anonymous service, crap, just drop in at any wi-fi hotspot, many
just ask you to click that you accept their T&Cs and you're on. Would
they raid them, I was just using one at a major hospital this week
that was just like that, if someone used that for child porn etc? But
I guess stick your nose out and say you're specifically offering anon
accts and watch out I guess.
