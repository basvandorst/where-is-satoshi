5-14-96. FiTi:    Reports on "Photobook," a "visual intelligence" comp.sys     for facial recognition designed by Alex Pentland at MIT's     Media Lab to "identify people who use multiple     identifications to commit fraud."    BT, the US Army, Kodak and Sensormatic are nibbling and the    White House is ogling it to "combat terrorism." Also:       The program could help find missing children, verify       indentification for electronic purchases and track down       on-line pornographers. Although the Big Brother aspect       may be troubling to some, to others it will provide       comforting security.    FAC_ial
