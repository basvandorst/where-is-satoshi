@_subject: Interpreting the Constitution 
References: It begins here and is extended by the 14th.  A judges job is to apply the law to the case presented to him.  For all federal judges (and today state judges) the law is a stack of rulings by other courts and laws based by legislative bodies.
For a federal court the stack is
The Constitution.
The accumulated federal statues
Case law
For state courts we have
The Constitution (per the 14th)
State Law
Case law
Any layer can be overridden by the layer above it, so state and federal judges are expected to take all layers into account to minimize the number of rulings that have to overturned on appeal.  It is also expected that lower courts take a more strict view of the law than appellate courts as the appellate courts job is to rule on points of law while the lower court is a primarily a finder of fact with ruling on law a secondary role (the difference between appellate and original jurisdiction).
