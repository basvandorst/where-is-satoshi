Beep say,
"How about this as a way to stump Clipper?
Generate a dialog between you and a friend of no relevant consequence.
Load this sound byte into your system as a AIFC file (sound bite, or byte)
Encrypt data/message/information/recipe/whatever into the low-bits of
the sound bite."
See my post "X's Last R". The problem is that PGP tattle tales on itself, it
having no raw encrypted message output format (~indistinguishable from random
data), and thus reverse steganography is trivial and can be automated. It could
be less trivial if you use a steganography (hiding a message in another
message) along with a secret scrambling routine for PGP messages, but then
you are in the silly situation of "encrypting" an already encrypted PGP
