See also "remanence":
(S)ATA actually has a protocol command ("secure erase") that will  cause the disk to over write all of its sectors, and not be usable  until its done. This doesn't exist in SCSI / SAS / FC as far as I know.
Generally speaking one over write is sufficient to prevent data from  being accessible, but various government standards specify anywhere  between one and four passes:
Degaussing or complete destruction is usually necessary for the "top  secret" stuff. DBAN is a useful (open-source) utility that I tend to  recommend for regular folk:
While it could be useful, there are penalties in various jurisdictions  for leaking data (especially with government-related stuff), so I'm  not sure if Sun would want to potentially expose itself to  inappropriate use that doesn't clean everything properly.
With ZFS encryption coming up, it could be sufficient to have your  data sets encrypted and then simply "forget" the key. The data is  still technically there, but (theoretically) completely inaccessible.
