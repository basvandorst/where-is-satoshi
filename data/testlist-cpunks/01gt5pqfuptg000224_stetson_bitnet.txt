But we both call the same system (at least the people I x-change keys with)
usually mindvox or a private system with a respected name... and in the case of
Minvox, we do a DCC on IRC... straight person-to-person...  to be
eavesdropping... one, they'd have to tap my line, heavy equipment needed to tap
a 16.8k HST v.42bis connection, seeing as I pretty much max out a phone line
and HST's are really picky... or two, they'd intercept a DCC on the IRC at
berkeley... but that's a 57.6k connection... however, that does seem
possible... does anyone have any suggestions on how to make e-transfers of keys
more secure, because, besides snail-mail (which would please the feds a lot) I
have no other way of getting my key to them...
geez, I didn't know it was this complicated... if someone screws with the key,
it just doesn't decode, correct?  nowadays, with MNP and ARQ-retries and all of
our little .bis buddies, not to mention the CRC's in transfer protos, wouldn't
that make an error in transfer EXTREMELY remote... so the only other way'd be
tampering and even then it just wouldn't decode, so what... you get the key
again... but I oversimplify the situation, I guess...
Oh, and I know this is going to make me sound like a complete idiot in front of
my peers, but I've always did straight tranfers of keys...  how do you put
ascii keys into your keyring?  I can't seem to make MacPGP do it... sniffle...
and if ihe reason I can't decode the key is due to an error in transmission,
forget this entire message...
