@_subject: What Clinton's proposal will mean to the Rest of the World 
Having just digested the press release, and the subsequent
followups on sci.crypt and on here, I am beginning to wonder what
ramifications this might have in other countries, specifically the
"Superpowers". Surely setting such a precedent in his own country will
spark off a flurry of activity in places such as the UK, Germany,
France et al, so that they are not "left behind", so-to-speak? To be quite honest, I can't see the English government taking such
radical steps about secure telecommunications, quite simply, because
BT have such a lacsidasical [sp?] approach to new and emerging
technologies. Take for instance, IDSN. Their philosophy of marketing
and "selling" ISDN is laughable - I once read a newspaper article which related a tale of a Corporation who wanted to learn if ISDN could be useful to it's business practices, and it seems that BT just kept jostling them between department (Dept X: "Phone Dept Y",
Dept Y: "Phone Dept X" etc). Can anyone really see that the US government (or whoever) will
completely outlaw all strong data encryption? This violates the
basic human right of free communications/privacy. What a world we live in, huh?

@_subject: Any PGP utils for Emacs? 
Does anyone have any elisp to integrate PGP into Emacs? I'm fed up of
having to use VI to send/receive all my encrypted mail, and there's no
point in me writing any code if someone already has.
So, is there any out there?

@_subject: [uk.transport] Speed Camera with OCR 
I thought this might be of interest to fellow cypherpunks, especially
to those of us in the UK.
Has anything like this been done in the US or Canada?

@_subject: Which remailers are up & working? 
Does anyone have an up to date of the anonymous remailers which are up
and running? I used the  Entropy and Hal's  the other day, and on both
cases I got bounced mail back.
What gives?

@_subject: Help needed in the Cypherpunks cause! 
Hi all,
I've been on  this list for  quite a while  now, mostly  listening and
learning, but with the occasional post now and then. What I've learned
is that it's important for us all (even outside the US) to "spread the
word" (as it   were) and let  people know  how important Privacy,  and
associated  areas are to us.  In fact, I saw a   program on UK TV only
yesterday in which Ann Winterton (an English Member of Parliament) was
advocating that  the UK Government  allow British Telecom to routinely
(ie,  without a permit/warrant etc)  tap and  intercept people's phone
calls. Without  a warrant!!! Her excuse  was that we needed to capture
child pornographers,  who were downloading them  using the PSTN. Yeah,
Anyway,  my call for   help is this. I've  got  to write my Final Year
thesis  starting in September, and since  we've got free reign on what
we say and  do, I'd like to take  the subjects of Encryption, Privacy,
Digital Cash (etc, etc, etc), and write a *decent* and *truthful* (ie,
a Cypherpunks view, *NOT* the media's,  or the Government's) thesis on
what it's all about, what it's not, how it all affects us, and what we
can all do. My intention is that  when it's all finished, I'll release
it into the public domain, and produce a Postscript file to be used as
an "intro" to the Crypto-world.
And since I'm no expert, and I want to make this a document showing us
in  a good (and honest) light,  it would be nice  if I could have some
suggestions as to the content, layout and format of the document. I've
prepared a  few questions, and if you  all wouldn't mind sparing a few
moments of your time in answering them, I'd be very grateful...
1, Do you see the need for a document such as this?
2, If not, how come?
3, What would you like to see covered in such a document?
4, What, if anything, would you like *not* to be covered?
5, How would you like it to be worded (ie, technical/beginner etc)
6, How would you like it be laid out?
7, Thanks in advance for your comments!
-Peace from London!

@_subject: CYPHER: Problems with pgp2.2 ELM scripts? 
Hi all,
Has anyone apart from me experienced problems with Vesselin's perl
scripts for ELM that came bundled with pgp2.2? I'm running ELM 2.4 pl21,
on a Sparc IPX, and basically, sometimes morepgp works, and sometimes
it doesn't. mailpgp is proving fine. Now, I'm no perl wiz, so I can't really dive in and fix it, nor am I
asking for someone to fix it (unless they want to), but it would be nice
to know that it's just not my utter ineptitude...  ;=)
