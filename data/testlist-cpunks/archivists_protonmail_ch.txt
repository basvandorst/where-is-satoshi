I'm a pen tester by trade. I don't believe these are for wireless attacks. They appear to be RF signal detectors; the dB scale is to indicate signal strength and for locating the proximity of broadcasting access points or devices.

Well that's interesting. I wondered why there were three units.
He put it in near the stairwell door (almost next to our door RFID), but
it was in full view of anyone walking to the elevators. So I don't think
he was trying to hide, otherwise he would have done it from behind the
stairwell door and not in plain sight. Maybe it was just bad opsec?
Awesome. Thanks for the advice. Will look wireless intrusion detection.
WPA-Enterprise too.
