Dear Cypher,
Nortel Networks is launching the next generation web environment so you can
harness the real power of the Internet.
'My Nortel Networks' is a new, personalized environment that gives you easier and faster access to the information you need.  You can customize your 'My Nortel Networks' page as well as the Customer Support website  by selecting the Content that is important to you and your business. And by taking control of the what, when and how information is displayed, you save time and have a powerful window into Nortel Networks. The launch of the new, My Nortel Networks will integrate the current  Custom News and the Marketing Product Catalog.  As subscribers of these services, you will automatically get My Nortel Networks.
The Customer Support Product Catalog will also be available within the new My Nortel Networks later in the Summer.  As My Nortel Networks gets closer to launch we will be contacting you again with more details, including how you can get access from day one.
My Nortel Networks - a web experience as individual as you.
