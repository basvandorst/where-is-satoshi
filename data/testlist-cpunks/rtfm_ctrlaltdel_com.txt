Clueserver.org would like to deny any connection to the above forgery
contest.  We are, in fact, working on our own contest involving a delivery
of e-cash to the first person who can predict the time and date of the
urinals in the FBI headquarters being electrified.  (Bonus e-cash if Freeh
is the first to pee in one.)
