Now That It's in the Broadband Game, Google Flip-Flops on Network Neutrality
By Ryan Singel
1:55 PM
In a dramatic about-face on a key internet issue yesterday, Google told
the FCC that the network neutrality rules Google once championed
don't give citizens the right to run servers on their home broadband
connections, and that the Google Fiber network is perfectly within its
rights to prohibit customers from attaching the legal devices of their
choice to its network.
At issue is Google Fiber's Terms of Service, which contains a broad
prohibition against customers attaching "servers" to its ultrafast 1
Gbps network in Kansas City.
Google wants to ban the use of servers because it plans to offer a
business class offering in the future.
