The Law Enforcement Field is used by my clipper chip to make the

that my clipper chip could have a subtle flaw causing the LEF (sp?)

to use it to to communicate with other clipper chips?  Would anyone be
able to tell that my chip was broken without the help of the key

My mini-essay for the cake-paper:
  The most important right is that of free speech.  The area in which
free speech is most important is political speech, and the most
important kind of political speech is political dissent.
  If all speech is subject to government scrutiny the right to
dissenting political speech is greatly reduced or eliminated.  The
chill of big brother's gaze silences many dissenters.  Key escrow is a
way for the government to gain the ability to scrutinize all of your
speech; it is an attempt to take away your most important right.

Speculation: The "A5 `scrambling code'" is used as the spreading code
for a spread spectrum radio.
Spread spectrum radio has some features cypherpunks may find
interesting: both stegnagraphic and cryptographic.  A Spread Spectrum
signal is usualy based on xoring a very high rate "pseudorandom"
bitstream with the intelligence to be transmitted.  The resulting wide
spectrum signal is usualy transmitted via radio.  As a result the
signal is very hard to notice since the watts/hz can be orders of
magnitude under normal narrow band signals (stegnography).  As a
second result, once detected the signal cannot be understood without
syncronizing an identicle "pseudorandom" bitstream at the reciever
(cryptography).  The reason that gov't types would fear the dispersal
of the technology is obvious.  Btw. many of the wireless lans use
exactly this technology.

Brad Huntting  asks:
  You are right.  This is perhaps *the* central design issue of this
kind of spread spectrum system.
  One standard solution is to use "gold codes".  Gold codes are
special in that they are very self dissilimar.  That is they look very
unlike any shifted version of themselves.  So you can build a very
simple corelator which tries all the possible shiftings of a code to
the signal, until one pops up with "low frequency" data rather than
"high frequency" noise.
  Another is to begin a transmission with a special sync header (and
concievably intersperse additional ones bassed on the expected
frequency of loss of lock).  Currently available PLL's working at
900MHz have very low phase noise, and I can imagine the construction
of fixed frequency PLL's with even lower phase noise.
  A third is to transmit BOTH the spreading code, and the data.  You
can think of this technique as sending two channels of data, one which
is all 1's (or 0's), the other which is a little more interesting.
The two channels are then combined at the reciever to yield the data.
  A fourth is to use an externaly generated sync signal -- for example
a radio transmission that both sender and reciever can hear.  (For
this aplication, I don't see how this would be used...)
  Aditional solutions are possible.  (What is this S.A.W. thing I read

I who did this.  It was I who introduced the class to the concept of
computer viruses.  I developed the idea with a guy named Eric ??? with
whom I worked at the time.  It was in private with Eric that I came up
with the name (or perhaps he may have sugested it).  I based the idea
on the "worm" from one of John Brunner's novels which I had just read.
  The name is a natural choice for this class of program, and I don't

In-reply-to: Hal's message of 17 Jan 93 13:47:45 EST <930117184744_74076.1041_DHJ40-1 at CompuServe.COM>
  Here is a minor change which can be used with the Poor Man's Cash
protocol to increase the burden on banks which wish to trace
transactions.  I will call it Poor Man's Wallet protocol.
  Rather than maintain accounts, have the bank maintain only a map
from bills to values.  The bank will support three kinds of
transactions: Combine, Split, Validate.
  To check that a bill is good, I ask the bank to VALIDATE b1.  It
responds with v and b2.  V is the value of b1, and b2 is a new bill
that has the value of b1 (- bank fee).  (Naturaly the new value of b1
will be 0.)  Worthless bills b1 could result in either a b2 with a
value of 0 (thus issueing a new 0 worth bill) or with no bill at all.
  To add money to my wallet, I ask the bank to COMBINE a bill b1 from
somewhere else, to a bill b2 from my wallet.  Both b1's and b2's value
get zeroed, and a new bill b3 with value = to v(b1) + v(b2) (- bank
fee) is returned to me.
  To break a bill down to more convinient sizes (perhaps when I wish
to pay some one), I ask the bank to SPLIT a bill b1 into b2 and b3,
where v(b3) = v(b1) - v(b2) (- bank fee).
  It may be better (as far as anonymity goes) to require the bank fees
be paid with a seperate bill.  It will be better to have many banks,
and to have the banks each validate bills of other banks.  Since in
this case your anonymity is the maximum of the anonymities of the
chain of banks involved.

@_subject: An ebank's vulnerability. 
I think that the physical location of an ebank's value reserve (be
it gold, corn, stock certificates, whatever) is really the trickyest
problem.  At that location the bank can be attacked by governments (or
other crooks).
  [enter fantasy... Person with gun says "Well, if all this money is
your's, then you sure owe us taxes (protection).  Don't pay and you're
going to jail (to the bottom of the river).  If it ain't your's, then
(I'll just take it for myself) you're a bank, and you're going to
jail." ...leave fantasy]
  One solution I see is to not have any physical deposit at all.  This
is what most governments do isn't it?  But without a physical resource
for reference the question of the value, or the origin of ecreds
becomes tricky (at least for my limited economic knowledge).  Suppose
I create a really great joke and try to sell it.  Where does the buyer
get the ecreds from?  If I wanted to buy a taco, would the vendor take
ecreds?  Would they take ecreds *I* printed up?
  Another solution is to use the banking system of a country which
*ALREADY* has anonymous value storage as a comodity for sale.  Supose
some enterprising Swiss citizen wanted to set up ebanking, I bet they
could do it.  I wouldn't mind my ecreds being denominated in Swiss
francs either.  But I suspect the Swiss government might drop by the
bank every year to collect some taxes from the accounts.  At what tax
rate would this become unacceptable?
  Someone could always set up an ungoverned value storage location.
Smuggling gold (or other valuables) into, with in, and out of governed
areas shouldn't cost too much, since valuables generaly have at least
the value/weight and value/volume than marijuana has.  The cost of
smuggling, and defending the valuables becomes the limiting factor.

@_subject: thresholding to enhance secrecy 
Summary: You can improve the secrecy of weak cypher systems by using
thresholding.  You can gain linear (or better) improvements for linear
increase in the cyphertext size.  No claim for change in signature
strength is made.
  Thresholding is the name for a way of breaking up a peice of
information into X peices so that Y <= X peices are needed to recover
the information.  If even Y-1 peices recovered, you still have no idea
what the original information is.  A simple thresholding system which
requires 2 out of 2 peices to recover the original is to transform M
into R and R+M where R is a random bit stream, and R+M is the same
random bit stream xored with the message.
  Concider the weak cypher systems S1, S2, S3...  where each has a
probability of being 'broken' X1, X2, X3...  requireing the (expected)
expense of E1, E2, ... EN effort.  Threshold your message P into N
peices, P1, P2, P3, PN, such that all N are required to recover the
message.  Send S1(P1), S2(P2), S3(P3)... SN(PN).  I belive that the
probability of breaking this system should be (1-X1)*(1-X2)*(1-X3)*
...*(1-XN) and that the effort to break it to be E1+E2+...EN (with a
smaller deviation that the sum of the deviations of Ei).  This is only
a linear increase in effort, but more than linear increase in the
probability of secrecy.  (right?)
  If people fear that PGP doesn't provide strong enough secrecy, we
could switch to PGP^3, or even PGP^10.  And if people are going to
compress their messages anyway, there doesn't seem to be any good
reason NOT to switch to PGP^2.
  There is probably a similar system which increases the strength of
signatures too.  Any ideas?  (I suspect the naive aplication of
thresholding here will DECREASE signature strength.)  How about a way
to *exponentialy* increase the effort and probability?  Then it
wouldn't matter much how weak our cyphers were!

@_subject: Secure comm program, Sockets + LINK 
Supose you opened up a socket on the local machine.  And that you
ran your usual telnet to connect to it.  The program listening on the
local socket would be responsible for running one end of a 'LINK' like
secure protocol.  It would connect to either the remote telnet socket,
or a special purpose socket at the remote end.  There either you can
use a pipe to a pty (standard telnet -> login shell -> LINK -> pty),
or in a special socket through LINK out the telnet socket.  (There is
an obvious extention with multiple hops through LINK-socket programs
which should provide the same kind of anonymity that is provided by
the CP remailers.)
  In this way, the data passing over the (presumed unsecure) net
connection (which might well be slip) is encrypted.  I am presuming
that both the local and remote kernels are 'secure' enough that you
would want to use them.
  The upside is that you get to use 'comercial grade' telnet==comm
  Of course this stratagy is no use for folks who don't have sockets
on both ends of the channel.  It is also likely to be obsoleted as
soon as secure-ip gets out.  Some ambitious sole might want to try the
analogous stratagy where a local pseudo-serial-device is created in
software, thus again getting 'comercial grade' comm==telnet programs.
  I sugest this stratagy, because it is one I am concidereing under MS
Windows.  I have a telnet which is acceptable, I have slip, and I have
the source to LINK, so...
(local-telnet) --kernel--> (local-LINK-SOCKET) ----unsecure-network---+
                  (remote-telnet) <--kernel-- (remote-LINK-SOCKET) <--+
(remote-pty) <--kernel-- (remote-LINK) <--kernel-- (remote-telnet) <--+
  Infact it would be nice to see some socket (perhaps 32?) become the
standard for the secure telnet service.
  Meanwhile, I did peruse the LINK source and am a little unhappy with
the actual protocol used in setting up the secure channel.  It is only
authenticated in one direction, rather than both (as I understand
it).  I would like to see two way authentication, and (perhaps)
Diffe-Helman key exchange.

From: Timothy Newsham    I assume you're talking about the link program I wrote.
Yes, I was talking about your program Link.     If so:   I never really considered the RSA exchange as authentication
   although it can be thought of that way I guess.
Right.  The only person who can participate (on one side) of the
exchange is the one with the private key which matches the other
side's public key.  This does provide a weak level of authentication.
(An opponent can record 'authentication' sequences, and replay them
later.  For this to be usefull, the opponent will have to have
discovered the session key which is/was being selected by the
   If (when) I implement DH key exchange I guess I should add some
   sort of authentication.
I was concidering a different authentication, and secret session key
selection protocol (the one that got away :>).  It would only use RSA
(or any other suitable public key system) to sign and check
signatures, as well as encrypt and decrypt data.  No new number
theory.  However, it would require both parties to know the public key
of the other.
This sort of protocol would be ideal for logins.  Both parties
authenticate the other, and no-one else can read the channel.  No
passwords are ever transmitted over the channel either.
You and I use a "sum" (xor perhaps?) of our two key halves as the
session key.  At any time one of us can simultaneously request
changeing the sesion key, and chalange the identity of the other.
To do this, I send you a new key half encrypted under your public
key.  You respond with a signature of the resulting session key
encrypted under my public key.  We then start using the new sesion
key.  At this point both directions are authenticated, and observers
can't determin the new sesion key.
Things are complicated a little by the fact that all comunication is
done under a secret session key.  Things also become a bit more
complex because there may be data you sent before recieving my key
change request.

My concerns about two way authentication become clear when you
concider the LINK+sockets program a substitute for rsh, rexec, login
or similar programs.  You don't want to be spoofed, and you don't want
others using your account.
  When you are using LINK in the way it was originaly designed, you
more or less *have* authentication in both directions.  From you to it
since discovering a private key given a public key is concidered
hard.  From it to you since *presumably* the only user able to read
the key file on the shared machine is you.
  The bootstrap problem (how you get the public key to the machine
with only unsecure chanels at your disposal) is interesting though.  I
wonder if it can be solved without DH key exchange?

If you compare the digital interceptor, to the voice interceptor,
fairly, you will see they are in equally strong positions.
  When I am phoneing a person I know, I am automatically checking the
`signature' of their voice.  The other party on the line might be able
to convince me they have a cold, but I hope I will have enough wisdom
to postpone discussing the March 15th assassination plot untill the
cold clears up.
  So we should compare a voice interceptor on a channel where the two
people don't know each other's voice to the unsigned digital
interceptor.  In this case, the interceptor can claim to one party to
be the other party, and remain undetected.  This is the Diffe-Helman
  Alternatively we should compare the voice interceptor on a channel
where the two people do know each other's voice to the signed digital
interceptor.  In this case, the interceptor will either be detected
should some minimal authentication and verification be tried, or the
interceptor will be unable to even listen in.  The weakness remains
here, but it has been patched over with authentication, and signed
verification of the channel key.  This is the Diffe-Helman weakness
  The (potential) interceptor is the reason why we must be so very
carefull when validating other people's public keys.  I know there is
no interceptor between me and the people who's keys I sign.  If I can
be sure of no interceptors between one of them, and the person I wish
to speak to, then I will be able to establish a secure channel.

In short, I sugest doing what you are thinking about: use two keys,
a high security key, and a low security key signed by the high one.
  Use a low security key signed by a high security one.  Change the
low security key every so often.  Keep the low security key under a
pass phrase unrelated to the one you use for the high security key,
and don't ever even store the high security key on the multi-user
system.  Then use some package (like my pgpmail.el) which connects
your multi-user system's mail program to pgp.  Sign your posts and
casual mail with the low security key, and if/when it is compromised
you will be able to issue convincing key change notices using the high
security key.  Naturally you should get other folks to sign your high
security key, not the low one.

@_subject: DId you ever think... 
In Crypto 93 is described a class of 2^55 (if I remember correctly)
IDEA keys for which IDEA offers scant security.  Your chances of
getting one of these is only 2^55/2^128 == 1 in 2^73 if you choose
your IDEA keys with a uniform distribution from the IDEA keyspace.
(The authors also propose a simple patch -- XOR each key part just
before use with 0DAE.  Does any one know of plans to implement this in
PGP, or of reports that this scheme doesn't solve the problem, or
introduces other problems?)
  So, DD wasn't lying, or even necesarily being tricky.  Other cyphers
have fallen before, and some cracks _are_ visible in IDEA already.
  Also, after reading Crypto '92 and '93 for a while, I am more and
more impresed and suprised with the work that NSA put into creating
DES from Lucifer.  Impressed that it was so good, and suprised that
the work was so honest (as far as anyone will report to date

  No, my writing ability is not in error here -- my mental model of
the history of DES is what is in error.  I will now update my personal
model of DES development to include two steps at IBM.  Lucifer ->
proto-DES at IBM, and proto-DES -> DES at NSA.  Learn something new
every day...  Since about 1977 I wondered what the 'rediscovered
crypto techniques' were.  Thanks!

Are you saying that IBM developed DES entierly on their own?  This
doesn't fit my model at all.  But, I'm not afraid to be wrong.
  Gladly! Please tell (learn) me: what was the history of the
development of DES.  How were DES, IBM, NSA, NIST (then NBS), and FIPS
related?  Wasn't there some concern on IBM's part about liability --
Thus the us Governments participation, including the 'secret' changes
to DES?
  Why would I do that?

@_subject: Weak IDEA keys... 
Well, I re-read the article, and here is the real dope.
In Crypto '93 Joan Daemen, Rene' Govaerts, and Joos Vandewalle write:
Abstract.  Large classes of weak keys have been found for the block
cipher algorithm IDEA, previously known as IPES [2].  IDEA has a
128-bit key and encrypts blocks of 64 bits.  For a class of 2^23 keys
IDEA exhibits a linear factor.  For certain class of 2^35 keys the
cipher has a global characteristic with probability 1.  For another
class of 2^51 keys only two encryptions and solving a set of 16
nonlinear boolean equations with 12 variables is sufficient to test if
the used key belongs to this class.  If it does, its particular value
can be calculated efficiently.  It is shown that the problem of weak
keys can be eliminated by slightly modifying the key schedual of IDEA.
[Typo's are probably mine :)]
  So, it isn't as bad as I thought.  Chances are about 2^51/2^128 ==
1/2^77 that you will get a bad key if you choose keys at random with
even distribution from the IDEA key space.  PGP tries to do exactly
this.  Once again, though, let me ask: has any one done anything about
implementing the _very_simple_ patch the authors describe?  PGP 2.5,
or 2.6 anyone?
  I am not _really_ paranoid, but I would hate it if a critical
message about the March 15th assassination plot were to fall into the
wrong hands because of a bad choice of IDEA keys.
  A related technical question: are there other easy to compute 2^n x
2^n -> 2^n 'invertable' functions than the three used in IDEA? (namely
(1) xor, (2) sum mod 2^n and (3) product mod (2^n)+1 with 0 taken to
represent 2^n.)

Oh, for instance, say liability to the banks who's electronic fund
transfers were stolen or forged.  But yeah, my understanding was that
IBM wouldn't release the cipher for general consumption unless some
Gov't would 'standardize' it and take the liability heat.
  Even the smaller 56 bit key was IBM's idea?  Why!??!?  Weren't they
in the business of making a _strong_ cipher?

This strikes me as another variant on the venerable 'book' cypher.    To quote Kahn (is that even close?  The guy who wrote _The Code  Breakers_.) 'What you gain in key size, you loose in key coherency.' In general book ciphers are not very strong.  (At least thats what I    think the big boys said...)   But, speaking of random numbers.  In Crypto '92 (or '93?) there is    this great protocol for two players (Andy and Beth say) to listen to a  poorly heard (radio) source (a low power satalite, or perhaps Radio    Free Bosnia) and extract a shared secret key -- even when an evil  opponent (Eve say) is listening with much better equipment.  This is really a great result!  It is at least as exciting as DH key exchange  (to me).  It's strength is based on probability and information theory    and not on 'unproven' complexity theory assumtions (such as 'discrete   logrithms are hard to compute').  But -- how do we make it work on the

@_subject: Broadening the use of Cryptography 
Long ago when I started writing pgpmail, I felt one reason people
weren't using PGP much was inconvineince.  So, I wrote code to fix
this.  Now if you use GNU Emacs to read and author mail (as I do) you
can use my pgpmail (FTP://ftp.markv.com/pub/pgpmail/*) to
automatically encrypt, decrypt, sign, and check the signatures -- all
with little or no effort. (C-c e to encrypt, everything else is 0
interaction, save entering your PGP passphrase.)
  Now admittedly, this only works on systems where GNU Emacs can read
mail and run PGP.  This translates to primairily multiuser unix
machines.  Sigh.  Well, at least you can do as I do, maintain 1 key
for low security multi user systems, and another (high hassel cost)
key for high security.
  The next project I am working on is a 'packet privatizer'.  Expect
alpha release sometime this or next year.

I do love to learn, I just wish it didn't have to involve pageing
through many bounce messages.  I have learned that most mailer
programs are unhappy with very long reply-to addresses.  You can rely
on about 200 to 300 chars, no more.  Too bad -- it looks like the real
easy hack won't work for too many hops.  It should work through two
remailers each with 512 bit keys, or one with 1024 bit key.
  One reply I got mentioned that author's previous experiments along
these lines.  (I am not mentioning the author's name so as to keep
their private message private.)  They mentioned trouble with the
reply-to field hack I tried; some mailers wee dropping the nice long
magic numbers.  They said the most reliable field was the subject
field.  I bet many mail agents are unhappy with long subjects too.
Hopefully they support subjects atlease as long as reply-to fields.

@_subject: Real world crypto problems -- Usenet 
Summary:  Use (anonymous) certificates to fix Usenet, and mailing lists.
  I think this message is interesting to the readers of cypherpunks
because it describes the a decentralized, crypto supported, solution
to the problems of e-speach in e-public places.
  If a message is found on a usenet group, a mailing list, or any
other 'e-public' space for that matter, one is tempted to assume that
its content is apropriate for the space, and interesting.  But who
certified that?  On moderated lists, the moderator(s) did, and things
usualy go a little more smoothly.  On unmoderated lists, only the
  Were there a way to attach signed judgements to posted articles (as
articles naturally), you could program your mail reader to skip
articles which aren't judged highly enough by your favorite judges.
Then, the flames would die away -- few people would judge them
interesting enough.
  The incentive for the reader is to improve their judgment of judges,
and so spend more time reading good stuff (neural net learning
anyone?).  The incentive for the judges is to earn 'reps' or money
(how to sell judgements?).  The incentive for the poster is to be
heard (improving their 'rep'), and so if no (important, in the
poster's opinion) judges like their stuff, they will feel an incentive
to improve their posts.
  Naturally the anarchist in me feels that any person shoud be able to
act as reader, poster, or judge at any time.
  What Usenet, this, and other lists lack are digital reputations.  I
belive it is a 'real world' problem which is aproaching the size of
the 'private email' problem.  I am going to abandon the private IP
stuff for a little while, and see if I can hack up a pseudonymous
certificate system ala Chaum from the bones of magic money.

=			  But *why* ratings?
  Readers only want to read good stuff; so they will enhance rating
capable post perusers, and they will comunicate with that post peruser
by rating authors of ratings, and other authors of general posts.
Think of it as a really smart killfile, you tell your post reader if
you liked, or didn't like an article, and it learns what ratings are
important to you.
  Authors want to be heard, and build up a 'rep' (and digital cash),
so they are incentivized to post good stuff, in apropriate places (and
when good enough, to sell the stuff).  Flamers will still flame, but
they will see clearly how many people read, or like their flames.
(and good flamers will sell their rants over in alt.flame...)
  Raters want to build up a 'rep' (and digital cash), so they are
incentivized to rate things (and like other authors, when their stuff
is good enough, they will sell it).

=		Which rating dimentions should we use?
  I really like the idea of a ratings system (no suprise).  But I
sugest a little more anarchistic, spontaneously ordered system.  Start
with _any_ set of dimentions, and let other people rate the
dimentions.  Popular dimentions will be rated highly, and unpopular
ones lowly.
=		  How should we format the ratings?
  I really like the format dimention-name.rating-digits with the
digits taken to be a value from 0 to 1.  But rather than only being
able to rate one article in one rating article, how about condensing
multiple ratings as shown below?  Then each ratings service (or
person) could batch things up, and distribute them with less

@_subject: low-overhead encrypted telnet 
The IP security program I have been working on (slowly) is a packet
redirector and cryptdec.  You ask it to encrypt packets comming in on
one socket, and pass them out to another socket (also to decrypt those
comming in on the second socket and pass them out the first socket).
Thus you can run one of these on the X server, and one on the X
client, and all the X trafic becomes encrypted over the net.  You can
telnet to the local redirector, to the forign redirector, and then to
the standard telnet port.  Or FTP, or whatever.
I am still learning about net software, and this vision may not be
easly implemented, or sockets may be the wrong level of interface to
the net, I dunno.  But I do know that my unix (SCO) and my X server
(WINDOWS) both support this stratagy.

@_subject: reply-to feeds an anon pool, jpp=pr0duct=cypher 
I have built an 'easy anonymous reply' program.  You can now use
reply-to addresses of the form jpp=0x123456 at markv.com, where 0x123456
is a public key id.  The obvious advantages are 'easy' reply-to's, no
stored return address of any kind, and automatic encryption.  The
obvious disadvantages are the need to scan through alt.test for
messages, that I have a list of all the 'bad' folks out there who want
anonymous addresses (though it is not clear how terible it is for me
to have a list of their public keys), and that I keep logs of the mail
messages.  My logs will be kept until I am sure the stuff works, and
then I will junk'em.  So encrypt, and use remailers if you need to --
I won't try to stop a government search of my disk.
  As a 'prop' to Pr0duct Cypher, I have a special hack that will send
mail addressed to jpp=pr0duct=cypher at markv.com to alt.test encrypted
with that famous CypherPunk's public key.  (And as a courtesy to you
all, I allow you to spell the address in any case, and with the letter
oh instead of the digit 0 if you want.)
  I might sell similar addresses for digicash -- send me mail with a
bid if you are interested.
  Below is the help file you would get if you mailed to
jpp=poolhelp at markv.com.  Try it out...
  If you send mail to jpp=0x123456 at markv.com, my program will look up
the key matching 0x123456 on my 'pool' key ring.  If it finds a
matching key, it will encrypt the whole message (including headers)
with that key.  Then it will post the result to alt.test with a
subject line matching 'Ignore 0x123456 blah blah blah' where blah blah
blah is the key's 'identifier.'  My mail program will be run for any
address which begins jpp=0x, so you can only use PGP keyid's.  As a
result, my program won't let you use a key if the key id is already in
use.  See below.
  To add a key to the 'pool' key ring, send mail to jpp=poolnew, the
body of the message should contain the public key in pgp format.  If
the key has a 0x123456 key id which is the same as a key already on
the keyring, my program will send a message by reply mail, and post a
message to alt.test, which has a subject 'Ignore jpp=poolnew key
already in use', and a body mentioning the key clash.  It will also
post using the clashed with key, the same thing, encrypted for the
'legitamite' user of that key with all your mail information, so that
they can talk to you about the problem.
  I will reward you if you can show me that you have managed to
'steal' a 0x123456 key id -- if you can get yours added to my 'pool'
keyring, even though there is already one there.  I will reward you
more highly if you tell me how to fix the problem.
  To remove your key from the keyring, send a signed message (in
simple english, spanish, or esperanto) asking me to remove your key.
Send the mail to jpp=poolmaster at markv.com.  For any other request,
send mail to jpp=poolmaster at markv.com (in english, or very simple
spanish or esperanto).  If you want to improve this help message, send
a copy to jpp=poolmaster at markv.com, and I will (probably) replace this
message with yours.
  For now, and untill I am sure this code is debuged, I will keep
comprehensive logs of the running of my code.  Use remailers, and
encryption as you think apropriate.
  All bets are off until I announce this service as operational -- all
service you get before that date is accidental (on my part).

10 cases == 240 cans right? or is it 120?
The question remains -- how many df's per 12 oz (I assume) can of
coke?  I also assume you mean cans of diet coke, rather than Diet Coke
(brand, and possibly empty) cans.  So, how much aluminun, and how much
Diet Coke brand soft drink is 1 df exchangeable for?

@_subject: Effects of S.314 (Communications Decency Act) 
For my congresional 'representatives'.
S.314 is not a moral bill.  Making the owner of a computer (or
computer network) responsible for what its users store (or transmit)
is like making the owners of a parking lot responsible for what is
stored in the cars parked there.  It just isn't moraly reasonable.
S.314 is un-American.  America has always been a place where speach is
freeest.  We have consistently held the expression of ideas to be one
of the very most important rights.  To hold the owner of a buliten
board responsible for the illegal messages posted to it, is to force
the buliten board owner to become a government censor in all but name
(and wages).  It effectively ends the bulliten board's use as a venue
of free speach.
S.314 is harmfull to America.  The kind of 'chilling effect' this bill
wil place on the computer (networking) industry would put american
companies at a serious disadvantage.  Could I really operate an
airline reservtion system for a large airline if I could be held
liable for illegal information transmitted using my equipment?  No.
Could I operate the masive software and hardware networks that the
phone system requires?  No.  But, I bet the company I own in Mexico,
or in Canada could.  They aren't burdened with such (artificially
created) liabilities.  Or perhaps I could get a special waiver from my
friends in Washington. Hmmm.  How much will these sorts of 'work
arounds' cost american bussiness?
S.314 is not enforceable.  There is no certain way to tell if a file
of data is an illegal one.  Stegnography and cryptography, along with
the fact that what a bit means depends on which programs are used to
interpret it, mean that even this message could be porno, terrorist
threats, or arangements for drug trafficing.  Imagin searching all the
cars in your parking lot for drugs.  Very expensive, and not very
reliable.  Tons of drugs travel past just such inspection sites each
year.  Now imagine how tough it would be if the drugs could be turned
into perfectly normal steal in the body panels of the vehicles!  That
is what stegnography and cryptography do to data.  Turn perfectly
'awfull' data into data perfectly indistinguishable from noise, and
then hide the noise as indistinguishable-from-inocent 'errors' in
other data.  Concider the spelling in this message -- convert each
word into a bit -- 1 if it is speled right, 0 if not.  Or how about
spacing, or, punctuation -- Hmmm.  Now supose we add otras idiomas,
aux eble muchos languages en cxiu mesagxon.  Will computer (network)
owners be responsible for the spelling, punctuation, language, word
choice, and grammer of all the electronic mail sent, received, and
S.314 is bad for *your* career.  If you vote to support it, I will
vote against you in upcoming elections.  I will work to impeach you.
I will never employ you, I will not read your memoirs, I will not do
business with you in any way what so ever.
I urge you to think twice, and then vote no on S.314.

Uh oh!  Egg on my face.  Will someone explain to me how the amendments
in S.314 make owners of ISPs or other computer systems liable for
'bad' data?  I apologize for my previous uncalled for (so it seams to
me now) ranting.

@_subject: My pgp emacs code in ftp://ftp.markv.com/pub/jpp/pgpelisp/* 
I have been hacking yet another emacs to pgp interface for some time
now.  I am happy with the current state of affairs, and am releasing
it for general consumption.  It supports automatic decrypting,
signing, signature checks and interfaces nicely with rmail.el and
  Also it includes a set of remailer functions which parse the ping
reports from Raph Levien  and give you a simple
interface to chaining a bunch of remailers together.
  The code is liscense free; use it, sell it, hack it up, export it,
claim it is yours, I don't care.  Feel free.  (How could I stop you
any way?  I suspect that number theory, and complexity theory *are*
the real natural rights.)
  My code is in ftp://ftp.markv.com/pub/jpp/pgpelisp/*
  It is not yet very well packaged.  Read 2b.emacs.  I still want to
clean up the remailer stuff a little before I spend time packaging.
(C-C commands, reply block building, and estimates of a chain's
reliability, (support for ghio and julf {pseudo, ano}nyms?))
  Unfortuneately my net connection, and means of support here at markv
will likely soon be gone :(...  This may be the last chance I have to
distribute or work on this code for a while.  If the code impreses you
with my ability to hack, you might want to make me a job offer :) Or
point me to jobs.  OTOH, if my ability to hack doesn't impress you,
please be quiet until I do get another job :).

Sandy, and other C'punks,
THIS IS A RESPONSE TO A GRAMMAR FLAME.  But not, I hope, a flame
I respect your opinion, Sandy, and am glad you like what I wrote.  And I
certainly don't take your grammar 'flame' personally.  In fact, I
_agree_ with what you have said.  But for one thing -- one of my
points was to rub their noses in a particularly stinky example of
stegnography.  What secret messages are concealed in my letter?  Can
anyone know?  That was an essential point to my letter.
In retrospect I would change the analogy from parking lots to mail
carriers.  (Does it make sense for a mail carrier to be held liable
for the 'bad' mail they happen to deliver?)  I would also probably
point out that the internet community standard for what is obscene is
awfully loose, and seems to focus mainly on a brand of pork meat
product. ;)
I just got off the phone with my 'representatives.'  Perhaps calling
them doesn't have the same impact that a letter does, but it is very
immediately gratifying.
j(who _can_ drive a spelling checker)'
P.S.  Yes, you made an error in your post :).  If you will proof my
letters to my reps I will proof yours.  Deal?

I have improved the list software, changed the list address into a
real internet style mailing list.  You should now be able to be join

Here is a copy of the welcome message, FYI.

@_subject: Protocols for a Data Bank 
^^^^^^^
  Why in the world would the bank want to sign blindly?  The bank
would be undertaking an obligation of an unknown nature.  Would you
sign a blank check?  A blank contract?  I wouldn't.
  Unless the comunication mechanism ensures anonymity, the bank can
know who deposited what, and who 'withdrew' what.
