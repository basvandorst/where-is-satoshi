@_subject: encrypting virus (KOH) 
I did not save the original potassium hydroxide posting, so I am not sure
whether it truly constitutes a "virus", but I can't let any defense of
"benign" infection mechanisms go unchallenged.
If someone gives me a floppy, and, by running a program contained on it
or booting off of it, some algorithm contained therein is permanently incorporated into my system *without my explicit desire and command*,
to me that constitutes a viral ATTACK on my system, by compromising the
sanctity of my data, whether or not the author's intent was benign.
Even if a question like "Compress [Encrypt] drive C: ?" were presented,
I'd be rather perturbed (especially since I use a Mac :-), since the
question would probably be completely outside of the context of what I
was trying to do (eg. run a GIF viewer, checkbook balancer, compiler,
whatever), and would not provide sufficient notification of potential
ramifications from answering in either the negative or the affirmative.
Should that happen to *me*, I'd immediately go for the reboot switch and
never use that floppy again; but most non-hacker computer users I know
would be pretty lost, and feel rather violated if they chose the wrong
option and something bad happened.
Now, if a smart compressor/encryptor wrote itself along with the files
it was treating, and then wrote a nice README file which explained that
files on the floppy were compressed/encrypted, would be automatically
decompressed/decrypted, and that the treatment could, if you wished, be
performed on your hard drives and/or other floppies by making a backup
and then executing the following command, that would be perfectly fine.
Low-pressure sales techniques are far more humane than high-pressure:
one gets time to scratch one's head, think about alternative strategies,
reconsider one's intent.  And a decision to reformat possibly years of
data from a universally-accessible native format to a proprietary format
certainly should not be made in an ad hoc manner.
If a compressor/encryptor has a mode whereby it can automatically compress/
encrypt native-mode floppies when they are first mounted, that's quite a
useful feature.  But in this case I would have first had to have made a pro-active decision to install the software on my system, and thus been
apprised of the ramifications.  I would certainly still want and expect
at least a minimal query like the above before anything is changed, otherwise
it would be too easy to forget the mechanism is in place, get a floppy from
a friend, and without knowing it return to them an altered and possibly
unuseable disk.  Not good.
I thought Cypherpunks were all for self-determination?  If there's anything
in the computer world which strips us of that it's a virus or trojan horse,

@_subject: Crypto Patent Abstracts #1 
I finally got to the library to do some patent searches.  Attached to
this mail is summary information on 6 significant crypto patents.  Note
that some of the patent numbers which have appeared in prior postings on
cypherpunks were incorrect, but I managed to track down the references
via other means; someone should make sure they're correct in any relavent
FAQs etc.
Of the 6, I have full-text for 4 of them:
and partial text for one more:
I hope to be able to get a full version of Hellman-Merkle, as well as:
within a week.
So, is there an FTP site I should place these on?
Have fun,

ABSTRACT: In a data exchange system working with processor chip cards, a chip card
transmits coded identification data I, v and, proceeding from a random,
discrete logarithm r, an exponential value x=2.sup.r (mod p) to the
subscriber who, in turn, generates and transmits a random bit sequence e to
the chip card. By multiplication of a stored, private key s with the bit
sequence e and by addition of the random number r, the chip card calculates a
y value and transmits the y value to the subscriber who, in turn, calculates
an x value from the information y, v.sub.j and e and checks whether the
calculated x value coincides with the transmitted x value. For an electronic
signature, a hash value e is first calculated from an x value and from the
message m to be signed and a y value is subsequently calculated from the
information r, s.sub.j and e. The numbers x and y then yield the electronic
signature of the message m.

ABSTRACT: A cryptographic communications system and method. The system includes a
communications channel coupled to at least one terminal having an encoding
device and to at least one terminal having a decoding device. A
message-to-be-transferred is enciphered to ciphertext at the encoding
terminal by first encoding the message as a number M in a predetermined set,
and then raising that number to a first predetermined power (associated with
the intended receiver) and finally computing the remainder, or residue, C,
when the exponentiated number is divided by the product of two predetermined
prime numbers (associated with the intended receiver). The residue C is the
ciphertext. The ciphertext is deciphered to the original message at the
decoding terminal in a similar manner by raising the ciphertext to a second
predetermined power (associated with the intended receiver), and then
computing the residue, M', when the exponentiated ciphertext is divided by
the product of the two predetermined prime numbers associated with the
intended receiver. The residue M' corresponds to the original encoded message

ABSTRACT: A cryptographic system transmits a computationally secure cryptogram over an
insecure communication channel without prearrangement of a cipher key. A
secure cipher key is generated by the conversers from transformations of
exchanged transformed signals. The conversers each possess a secret signal
and exchange an initial transformation of the secret signal with the other
converser. The received transformation of the other converser's secret signal
is again transformed with the receiving converser's secret signal to generate
a secure cipher key. The transformations use non-secret operations that are
easily performed but extremely difficult to invert. It is infeasible for an
eavesdropper to invert the initial transformation to obtain either
conversers' secret signal, or duplicate the latter transformation to obtain
the secure cipher key.

ABSTRACT: An improved software cryptographic apparatus and method are disclosed. The
apparatus and method enables the encryption of the object code of a program
so as to enable relocatable code operations. The apparatus and method will
adapt program execution for a mixture of encrypted and nonencrypted code. A
particular advantage of the apparatus and method is its accommodation of
interrupts and branches while carrying out the cryptographic function.

generated from a secret transformation of the message sent by the authorized
transmitter; the cryptogram is again transformed by the authorized receiver
using a secret reciprocal transformation to reproduce the message sent. The
secret transformations use secret cipher keys that are known only by the
authorized transmitter and receiver. The transformations are performed with
nonsecret operations, exponentiation, that are easily performed but extremely
difficult to invert. It is computationally infeasible for an eavesdropper
either to solve known plaintext-ciphertext pairs for the secret cipher keys,
or to invert the nonsecret operations that are used to generate the

But, they have a free dialup to the PTO's online "USPAT" database, which I
have been using for the past few months.  I will be there using the system
sometime during the week of June 22.  It would certainly be possible for me
to capture abstracts, legal info (assignees etc.), etc. on a floppy and
transfer it to the c-punks archive.  Depending on how busy the library happens
to be, I might also be able to get the fulltext of claims, and even maybe the
full disclosure statement, for a limited number of patents (it takes a *long*
time to download, and anything but citations is considered bad etiquette if
anyone is waiting for the single terminal).
I am willing to do this (time permitting, of course), if:
    (1) a person of credibility can assure me that I am not violating any
        copyright or other legislation by doing so.
    (2) one or more cypherpunks takes responsibility for gathering and
