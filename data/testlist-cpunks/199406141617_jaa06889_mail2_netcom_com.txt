I *cannot* figure out why nobody has responded in a week to this
new revelation, as it has total relevance to the Cantwell Bill!
Once again,
Sumex-aim.stanford.edu, the internet's biggest Mac ftp archive has
been *EXPORTING* MacPGP2.2, many times a day, every day for over
a YEAR. This is automatic, since there are mirror sites in most
countries on the internet, including Singapore and China. *Had*
someone picked up on this sooner, there would still be time to spread
the word to the point where congresscritters would know this was
going on.
I don't care any more. Y'all deserve what y'git. I send my fax.
