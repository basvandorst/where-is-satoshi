It's the easy way out (and I mean DOWN and OUT)!  I mean, if we're simply
going to change them out everytime, why bother to figure out which ones aren't
evil/stupid (I mean, out of all those politicians, there's got to be 1 or 2!

@_subject: Amway and Brave Combo Evidence Update 
On that page I point to with the X-tian fish discussion, I linked the
"moderator nazi" with the right-wing because of his use of this symbol "&" to
replace the "And" in "Andy".  I have come to learn, it's got 2 meanings.  It
looks like the symbol for the "Know-nothing" movement is - "K & N".  Of
course, to know the significance of that, you have to know something about the
"Know-nothing" movement.  I think anyone that's ever observed many of the
lists around, will see some remarkable similarities.  Check this out -
Know-nothing (1827) 1 a : IGNORAMUS b: AGNOSTIC 2 cap K & N : a member of a
19th century secret American political organization hostile to the political
influence of recent immigrants and Roman Catholics
Know-nothingism (1854) 1 cap K & N : the principles and policies of the Know-
Nothings 2 : the condition of knowing nothing or desiring to know nothing or
the conviction that nothing can be known with certainty esp. in religion or
morality 3 often cap K & N : a mid-twentieth century political attitude
characterized by anti=intellectualism, exaggerated patriotism, and fear of
foreign subversive influences
Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 10th edition
'Know-Nothing' Movement
U.S. political movement in the mid-19th cent. The increased immigration of the
1840s had resulted in concentrations of Roman Catholic immigrants in the
Eastern cities. The Democrats welcomed them, but local nativist societies were
formed to combat "foreign" influences and uphold the "American" view. The
American Republican party, formed (1843) in New York, spread to neighboring
states as the Native American party and became a national party in 1845. Many
secret orders sprang up, and when outsiders made inquiries of supposed
members, they were met with a statement that the person knew nothing; hence
members were called Know-Nothings. The Know-Nothings sought to elect only
native Americans to office and to require 25 years of residence for
citizenship. Allied with a faction of the WHIG PARTY, they almost captured New
York in the 1854 election and swept the polls in Massachusetts and Delaware.
In 1855 they adopted the name American party and dropped much of their
secrecy. The issue of slavery, however, split the party, and many antislavery
members joined the new REPUBLICAN PARTY. Millard FILLMORE, the American
party's presidential candidate in 1856, won only Maryland, and the party's
national strength was broken.

Cypherpunks, these are the bastards that have control of congress.  If you are
serious about freedom, you must go out and register to vote, and you must vote
the real punks (Christian Coalition types (the CC is simply a front for the
Know-nothing movement, and I'll bet you now believe me. ;-) )) out of power.
They are the bastards that are controlling speech (and thought, IMHO) on that
Camelogue list (the Humpheads).  AND they were doing the same thing on that
Brave Combo list (The Bucketheads gang that I seem to have incapacitated.
Hey, can I say that I saved the Brave Combo?  ;-) )
And the evidence is on Brave Combo cds.  Not only the one that I'm on, but now
that I've gone in looking at it from this angle, I see they've been
documenting the invasion of the Bucketheads for 10 years.
It starts with Humansville with the cover showing a "the" 'beast', IMHO
raising it's ugly head out of the water.  Also on that one, is a song called
"Move" which starts with a message that was left on Jeffrey Barnes answering
machine one night, that threatened him to turn down his music.  There was no
music being played in his house that night.  They were trying to tell him to
censor the Brave Combo.  I haven't had a chance to search that album for other
stuff yet.  Those were the obvious things.
The theme continues for the next 4 Brave Combo (only (they were doing
collabarations also during this period)) studio releases.  Since yous guys are
Cypherpunks, I'm not gonna give you that many more clues (for right now, there
are some songs patterned after certain specific Bucketheads that you probably
won't get the connection, but if you think of various folk you've met on the
net, I'll bet you find some remarkable similarities in the
lyrics/titling/liner notes)
So, it continues on to the next ones (and in this order) -
Night On Earth
No No No-Cha Cha Cha
Polkas For A Gloomy World (BTW: Grammy nominated, lost (probably due to the
Know-nothings.  Study this one's liner notes VERY carefully (and Mystery Spot
Polka lyrics for sure))
And up to the one I'm on - 'Group Dance Epidemic - Fun ...... and Functional!'
Those are all excellent cds, but if you don't want to spend the money, all of
the lyrics are on the Discography page (
at the official website (which the Bucketheads still seem to have some control
of.  How do I know?  Guess which lyrics they DON'T have there.  The Jeffrey.
(and other reasons) I forced them to put the Mystery Spot Polka's lyrics up
there when I attempted to discuss it on the list (and I was censored.)  They
had to try to show that it wasn't being censored.)
So, I'll post my interpretation of The Jeffrey because of that -
The Jeffrey
(Barnes, Cripps, Finch, Hernandez - Wise Monkey Music)
(Jeffrey (spoken)) I am the master of my own universe
And I dance just as good as I want to
I am a genius because I want to be
I have created a dance in my own image

(backup) One, two, three, four

I'm waiting.  I've been waiting.
Wow!  Someone came along and analyzed my song, and (pretty much) nailed it!
How can you tell the dancer from the dance.
That is what is revealed by careful analysis of my song - how YOU can know
about certain-type of people that "lurk (dictionary definition)" the Brave
Combo list
(girl) moans - Oh, Oh, Oh Oh Jeff, your dance is devine
I like your song, Jeff (SERIOUSLY!  :-) (I really mean this, Combo fans! ;-)

Move my body with your hands

Jeffrey's answer - Join FreeGroup

U (
(backup (sung)) Your hips will take care of themselves
Hippies will take care of themselves
(Jeffrey) 'Hip'ssssssss
Yes, he's the creator of his song and dance.  The song describes a dance
created by man, the "Know-nothing" movement (otherwise known around here as
the "Chicken" Coalition).  The dance is, well, I've already given you a hint
as to where that is, Cypherpunks!
Resume the active things!
Get off of your butts and stop being politically apathetic.  NOW!  Take these
guys out of power (they're preventing you from expressing yourself, and
they're trying with all their might to prevent Jeffrey (Carl, etc.) from
expressing himself)
(backup (sung)) Hips will take care of themselves
I am the master of my own universe
And I dance just as good as I want to
I am a (UNDISPUTED) genius, because I used my own free will to decide to play
the 'United Snakes ... '  ;-) in the BRAVE Combo (he plays 2 saxaphones at the
same time.  In harmony)
I have created a dance in my own image
My song and dance is just like me.
LOOK AT ME!
He's Mad!  Only one Combo fan knowing the true meaning of his song and dance
is NOT good enough for a genius!  Analyze his song and dance.  He's waiting.
A review of recent history reveals that Brave Combo fans that truly 'get'
their music are HIGHLY rewarded.
(liner notes)
The band once discovered Jeffrey Barnes doing this dance all by himself in a
corner.  He denies all responsibility, as his conscious mind was elsewhere at
the time.
Part I
All dancers get on dance floor
(with great enthusiasm)
1.  Do nothing.
2.  Stand with your arms folded across your chest.
3.  Shift your weight from one leg to another
4.  Exhibit all symptoms of extreme boredom.
When this becomes unbearable, move on to Part II.
Part I represents 'closed-mindedness'/censorship/Bucketheads
Part II
1.  Put fist out with thumbs up.
2.  Attach your thumbs to turntables in your mind.
3.  Rotate your thumbs clockwise.
Check out the right
4.  Rotate your thumbs counter-clockwise.
Check out the left
5.  Your hips will want to wiggle, let them.
But Hippies will want to investigate things other than just left and right,
you better let them.  :-)
When this becomes unbearable, return to Part I.
Part II represents "open-mindedness"/freedom/Stan
Repeat Part I and Part II until you wish to stop.
So you Bucketheads can do your 'dance' for as long as you want, but while
you're doing that, us Hippies will take care of ourselves.
Various lines in there refer to various posts that I posted during that so-
called "flame" war.  If anyone wants to see a few of those, let me know.
"I want you to know", that compared to breaking the Buckethead gang, getting
on that cd meant very little to me, except, that it was designed as a tool for
me to use against the Know-nothings.
I think I'll go post that over on the Brave Combo list.  'Tis a shame that my
only audience, is the Bucketheads (and the Camelogue moderator nazi is lurking
(dictionary definition) the list.).  The Bucketheads ran everyone who wouldn't
"drink" with them off.
Guess what, Cypherpunks.  I'm betting that 95% of the music (probably other
forums as well (Republicans For All Americans is one I know about for sure))
lists (and websites) are in control of the "Know-nothings."  We have got to
get those kooks out of power, or it will be too late.
It's VERY possible that your favorite musicians are trying to send secret
messages out to thier fans through their music/lyrics and cover art, personal
notes, etc., on this very same subject matter.  Look for these clues to find
out if your favorite bands lists/websites have the same "pesky" problem.  They
can't tell you outright because they got Know-nothing goons watching 'em.
"That's all we know."
Serious shit, Sherlock(s)!

Hi cyphers, I'm back.  A certain 'nobody' invited me!  ;-)
Apparently only as far back as 1993, the definition of the word "spam" from
the on-line jargon file was this (according to the New Hackers Dictionary) -
spam [from the MUD community] vt. To crash a program by over-running a fixed-
size buffer with excessively large input data.  See also Buffer Overflow,
Overrun Screw, Smash the Stack.
Obviously that definition has changed since then.  I've seen it go from that
to repetitive commercial advertising, and I've seen it used to brand someone
as an outcast of a list for future removal simply because a small minority
didn't like what that person had said (so it was being used at that time to
mean 'objectional material').
And in all the times I've seen the word fly, there has never been anykind of
volume that would come close to overblowing the forum's mechanical
So, I'm curious as to who/what dictated the meaning of that to change so

is so lax, they could disable the entire Internet in a half-hour. Members of
the hacker think-tank called ``The Loft,'' who were praised by senators for
calling attention to the problems of computer security, also warned that they
could transfer Federal Reserve funds by computer and disrupt electrical power.
One hacker, identified by his online handle ``Mudge,'' told the Senate

Alice's Restaurant Massacree - by Arlo Guthrie
This song is called Alice's Restaurant, it's a - bout Alice - and the
But Alice's Restaurant is not the name of the restaurant that's - just the
name of the song
That's why I call the song Alice's Restaurant

You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant
Now it all started 2 Thanksgivings ago thats on 2 years ago on Thanksgiving
when my friend and I went up to visit Alice at the Restaurant, but - Alice
doesn't live in the Restaurant, she - lives in the church nearby the
restaurant in the bell tower, with her husband Ray and, Fasha the dog and
living in the bell tower like that they got a lot of room downstairs where the
pews used to've been, having all that room, seein' how they took out all the
pews, they decided that they didn't have to take out their garbage for a long
We got up there, we found all the garbage in there and we decided it'd be a -
friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump.  So we took
the half-a-ton of garbage put it in the back of a red VW microbus took shovels
and rakes and impliments of destruction and - headed on toward the city dump. Well we got there there's a big sign and a chain across the dump saying
"closed on Thanksgiving" and, we had never heard of a dump closed on
Thanksgiving before and with - tears in our eyes we drove off into the sunset
looking for - another place to put the garbage.  We didn't find one -
'Till we came to a side road and off the side of the side road was another 15
foot cliff and, at the bottom of the cliff was another pile of garbage and, we
decided that 1 big pile was better than 2 little piles and rather than bring
that one up, we decided to throw ours down.  That's what we did. Drove back to
the church had a Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat went to sleep and
didn't get up until the next morning, when we got a phone call from Officer
Said "Kid -  we found your name on an envelope at the bottom of a half-a-ton
of garbage and - just wanted to know if you had any information about it" and
I said "yes sir Officer Obie, I cannot tell a lie - I put that envelope under
that garbage."
After speaking to Obie for about 45 minutes on the telephone we finally
arrived at the truth of the matter and said that we had to go down and pick up
the garbage and, also had to go down and speak to him at the Police Officer
station so we got in the red, VW microbus with the shovels and rakes and
implements of destruction and headed on towards the Police Officer station.  Now friends, there was only 1 of 2 things Obie could've done at the Police
station, and the 1st was that he could've givin us a medal for being so brave
and honest on the telephone, which wasn't very likely, and we didn't expect
it, and the other thing was, that he could've bawled us out and told us never
to be seen driving garbage around the vicinity again.  Which is what we
expected, but when we got to the Police Officer station, there was a 3rd
possibility that we hadn't even counted upon, and we was both immediatly
arrested.  Handcuffed and I said Obie "I - don't think I can pick up the
garbage with these handcuffs on."  Said "Shut up kid, get in the back of the
patrol car" and that's what we did, sat in the back of the patrol car and
drove to the quote "scene-of-the-crime" unquote.
I want to tell you about the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts where this
happened here, they got 3 stop signs - 2 police officers and 1 police car, but
when we got to the "scene-of-the-crime", there was 5 police officers and 3
police cars - being the biggest crime of the last 50 years and everybody
wanted to get in the newspaper story about it.  And they was using up all
kinds of cop equipment that they had hanging around the Police Officer
station.  They was taking plaster tire track footprints dog smellin' prints,
and they took twenty-seven 8 by 10 color glossy photographs, with circles and
arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was to
be used as evidence against us.  Took pictures of the approach, the getaway,
the northwest corner, the southwest corner, and that's not to mention the
ariel photography.
After the ordeal, we went back to the jail Obie said he was gonna put us in
the cell, said "Kid, I'm gonna put you in the cell, I want your wallet and
your belt."  I said "Obie, I can understand you wanting my wallet so I don't
have any money to spend in the cell but what do you want my belt for?" Said
"Kid - we don't want any hangins."  Said "Obie, did you think I was gonna hang
myself for littering?"  Obie said he was making sure, and friends, Obie was
'cause he took out the toilet seat so I couldn't hit myself over the head and
drown.  And he took out the toilet paper so I couldn't bend the bars, roll
out, roll the toilet paper out the window, slide down the roll and have an
escape.  Obie was making sure, and it was about 4 or 5 hours later, that
Alice, remember Alice?  It's a song about Alice.  Alice came by and with a few
nasty words to Obie on the side - bailed us out of jail, we went back to the
church, had another Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat and didn't get
up until the next morning, when we all had to go to court.
We walked in, sat down. Obie came in - with the twenty-seven 8 by 10 color
glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each
one, sat down.  Man came in said "All rise." We all stood up	and Obie stood up
with the twenty-seven 8 by 10 color glossy pictures and the Judge walked in,
sat down with a seeing-eye dog and he sat down.  We sat down.  Obie looked at
the seeing-eye dog.  And then at the twenty-seven 8 by 10 color glossy
pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one -
and looked at the seeing-eye dog.  And then at the twenty-seven 8 by 10 color
glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of
each one and began to cry - 'cause Obie came to the realization, that it was a
typical case - of 'American Blind Justice', and there was nothing he could do
about it, and the Judge wasn't gonna look at the twenty-seven 8 by 10 color
glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of
each one explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us.  And
we was fined fifty dollars and had to - pick up the garbage in the snow, but -
that's not what I came to tell you about.  Came to talk about the draft.
They got a building down in New York City it's called 'Whitehall Street' where
you walk in and get injected, inspected, detected, infected, neglected and
selected.  I went down to get my physical examination one day and I walked in,
sat down - got good and drunk the night before so I looked and felt my best
when I went in that mornin'.  'Cause I wanted to look like the all American
kid from New York City.  Man I wanted, I wanted to feel like the all, I wanted
to be - the all American kid, from New York and I walked in, sat down I was
hung down, brung down, hung up and all - kinds of mean, nasty, ugly things,
and I walked in, I sat down, they gave me a piece of paper that said "Kid -
see the Psychiatrist, room 6O4.  And - I went up there, said "Shrink, I wanna
kill. I mean I wanna, wanna kill.  Kill.  I wanna, wanna see, I wanna see
blood and gore and guts and veins in my teeth. Eat dead burnt bodies.  I mean
kill. Kill. KILL. KILL."  And I started jumping up and down, yellin' "KILL.
KILL."  And he started jumping up and down with me with me, and we was both
jumpin' up and down, yelling "KILL.  KILL."  And the Sergeant came over,
pinned a medal on me, sent me down the hall, said "You're our boy."  Didn't
feel to good about it, uh, proceeded down the hall getting more injections,
inspections, detections, neglections, and all - kinds of stuff that they was
doin' to me at the thing there and I was there for 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours -
I was there a long time goin' through all kinds of mean, nasty, ugly things
and I  - was, just having a tough time there and they was inspecting,
injecting every - single part of me, and they was leavin' no place untouched.
Proceeded through and I - when finally came to see the very last man, I walked
in, I walked in, sat down after a whole big thing there, and I walked up and
said "What do ya want".  He said "Kid, we only got one question - have you
ever been arrested?"
I proceeded to tell him the story of the 'Alice's Restaurant Massacree' with -
full orchestration and five part harmony and stuff like that and then all the
phenomina "Stop It Right There" said "Kid - did you ever go to court?"
I proceeded to tell him the story of the twenty-seven 8 by 10 color glossy
pictures with the circles and arrows, and a paragraph on the back of each one
"Stop It Right There" and said "Kid - I want you to go over and sit down on
that bench that says 'Group W' - NOW KID!"
I, and I, I walked over to the, to the bench there, and there is - there's
Group W's where they, where they put ya, if you may not be moral enough to, to
join the Army, after committing your special crime and - there was all kinds
of mean, nasty, ugly looking people on the bench there -  mother rapers -
father stabbers - father rapers! - father rapers sittin' right there on the
bench next to me and, one, they was mean and nasty and ugly, and horible and
crime, fighting guys was sittin' on the bench.  And the meanest, ugliest,
nastiest  one - the meanest father raper of them all, was coming over to me,
and he was mean and ugly and nasty and horible and all kinds of things, and he
sat down next to me and said "Kid - what did ya get?"
I said "I didn't get nothin', I had to pay fifty dollars and pick up the
garbage". He said "What were you arrested for, kid?" and I - said "Littering"
- and they all moved away from me on the bench there and the hairy eyeball,
and all kinds of mean, nasty things, 'till I said "and creating a nuisance"
and they all came back, shook my hand and we had a great time talkin' about
crime, mother stabbin', mother raping, and all kinds of groovy things that we
was talkin' about on the bench.  And everything was fine, we was smoking
cigarettes and all kinds of things, until the Sergeant came over - had some
paper in his hand, said "Kids - This piece of papers got 47 word 37 sentences 58 word we want to know detail
of the crime time crime and any kind of thing you got to say time and tune
about the crime unknown arresting officers name and everything you got to
say..." and he talked for 45 minutes, and nobody understood a word that he
said, but we had fun filling out the forms and playing with the pencils on the
bench there and - I filled out the 'Massacree' with the 4 part harmony and -
wrote it down there, just like it was and everything was fine and I - put down
the pencil and turned over the piece of paper and there - there on the other
side - in the middle of the other side - away from everything else on the
other side - in parenthesis - capital letters - quotated - read the following
words.  "Kid - have you rehabilitated yourself?"  I went over to the Sergeant and said
"Sergeant, you've got a - lot of damn gall to ask me if I've rehabilitated
myself, I mean - I mean - I mean, I just, I'm sittin' here on the bench, I
mean I'm sitting on the Group W bench - because you want to know if I'm moral
enough to join the Army, burn women, kids houses and villages after being a
litterbug."  He looked at me and said "Kid - we don't like your kind - and
we're going to send your fingerprints off to Washington" and friends -
somewhere in Washington enshrined in some little folder is a - study in black
and white - of my fingerprints.  And the only reason why I'm singing you this song now is because you may know

Motorcycle (Significance of the Pickle) Song - Arlo Guthrie
I don't want a pickle
Just want to ride on my motorsickle
And I don't want a tickle
I'd rather ride on my motorsickle
And I don't want to die
Just want to ride on my motorcy - cle
You know, it's been about 12 years now that, I've been singing this dumb song.
You know, it's amazing, it's amazing that somebody could get away with singing
a song this dumb for that long. But you know, hey you know what's more amazing
than that is that, is that uh, somebody could make a living singing a song
this dumb.  But, that's America!
You know, I told about everything there was to tell about it.  When I wrote
it, how come, why, what for, but you know the one thing, that I always used to
neglect to explain, was the significance of the pickle.
It was the time I was riding my bike, I was going down a mountain road.  I was
doing 150 miles an hour.  On one side of the mountain road there was a
mountain, and on the other side there was nothin', it was just a cliff in the
air.  But I wasn't paying attention you know I was just driving down the road.
All of a sudden by accident, a string broke off my guitar.  It broke you know
right there went flying across the road that way, wrapped itself around a
yield sign.  Well the sign didn't break, it didn't come out of the ground, the
string stayed wrapped around it. Stayed in the other end of my guitar, I held
on to my guitar with one hand.  I held on to the bike with the other.  I made
a sharp turn off the road.  Luckily I didn't go into the mountain. I went over
the cliff.  I was doing 150 miles an hour sideways, and 500 feet down at the
same time.  Hey, I was looking for the cops, 'cause you know, hey I knew that
you know it, it was illegal.
Well, I knew that it was it.  I knew I didn't have long, to live in this
world.  And in my last remaining seconds in the world I knew that it was my
obligation to, write one last farewell song to the world.  Took out a piece of
paper, I pulled out a pen, and it didn't write I, I had to put another ink
cartridge in it.  I sat back and I thought for awhile and then it come to me,
it come like a flash, like a vision burnt across the clouds.  I just wrote it
down.  I learned it right away.  I don't want a pickle, just want to ride on
my motorsickle.  And I don't want a tickle, I'd rather ride on my motorsickle.
And I don't want to die, just, want to ride on my motorcy - cle.  Hey I, you
know, I knew it wasn't the best song I ever wrote, but I didn't have time to
change it. But you know the most amazing thing was, that I didn't die, I
landed on the top of a police car, and it died.
I come into town, I come into town at a screaming 175 miles an hour singing my
new motorcycle song.  I stopped out in front of the deli and out in front of
the deli was a man, eating the most tremendous pickle, a pickle the size of
four pregnant watermelons, just a huge monster pickle.  He walked up to me,
pushed a pickle in my face and started asking me questions.  It was about the
same time I noticed a pickle in my face I noticed a cord hanging from the long
end of the pickle going up his sleeve down his shirt into his pants and shoes
out into a briefcase he had near his feet.
I knew it wasn't a ordinary pickle.  But it was about the same time I noticed
the cord hanging out ot the pickle that a 4 foot cop arrived, with a 5 foot
gun.  A cop that one time, must have been around 6 foot 3, but was met at the
bottom of a mountain, by a flying, singing, writing, weirdo freak.  He walked
up and with one tremendous hand he grabbed the pickle away from the other guy.
He threw it, a hundred feet, straight up in the air.  And while the pickle was
half way between going up and coming down, he took out his gun and put a 3
inch bullet hole right through the long end of the pickle.  It started coming
back down.  He stuck out his foot.  He caught the pickle on his big toe.  And
balancing the pickle on his big toe he reached his huge hand into his little
pocket, pulled out a 10 foot ticket.  He borrowed my pen, he wrote it up, then
he rolled it up, and stuffed it in the bullet hole in the middle of the
pickle, took the pickle with the ticket and shoved it down my throat.  It was
at that very moment, that the pickle with the ticket was going down my throat
that, I knew for sure that, that I didn't want a pickle.
I don't want a pickle
I just want to ride on my motorsickle
And I don't want a tickle
I'd rather ride on my motorsickle
And I don't want to die
Just want to ride on my, motorcy - cle
And on to the meat of the matter, the FBI -
Subj:	Re: Another Cop Bashing Story + FBI Bashing
<< YES!!! I actually do have an original copy! It's on the album "ARLO" . I'll
work on that transcript this weekend. I also have "Hobo's Lullaby" Pretty cool
stuff dude!   >>
Ok, then you deserve this -
The Pause of Mr. Claus - Arlo Guthrie
(introduction) This next song, we're going to dedicate to a great American
organization.  Tonight, I'd like to dedicate this, to our boys, in the FBI.
Well, wait a minute, it's hard to be a FBI man.  I mean, first of all to be a
FBI man you have to be over 40, years old.  And the reason is, that it takes
at least 25 years with the organization, to be that much of a bastard.  Now,
it's true you just can't join, you know it kinda it needs a atmosphere where
your natural bastardness, can grow and develop and, take a meaningful shape in
today's complex society.  But that's not why I want to dedicate the song to the FBI.  I mean the job
that they have to do, is a drag!  I mean they have to follow people around.
You know, that's part of their job.  Follow me around.  I'm out on the
highway, and I'm drivin' down the road, and I run out of gasoline and I pull
over to the side of the road, they got to pull over too, make believe they ran
out.  You know, I go to get some gasoline, they have to figure out whether
they should stick with the car, or follow me!  Suppose I don't come back and
they're staying with the car.  Or if I fly on the airplanes.  I can fly half-
fare because I'm 12 - 22, and they got to pay the full fare.  But, well, what
the thing is when you pay the full fair, you have to get on the airplane first
so that they know how many seats are left over for the half-fair kids.
Allright and sometimes there aren't any seats left over and, sometimes there
are but that doesn't mean you have to go!  Well suppose he gets on and fills
up the last seat.  So you can't get on, then  he gets off, then you can get
on!  What's he going to do?  Wait, well, it's a drag for him.
But that's not, that's not why I want to dedicate the song to the FBI.
During, during these hard, days, and hard weeks, everybody always has it bad
once in a while, you know you, you have a bad time of it, and you always has a
friend that says "hey man, you ain't got it that bad, look at that guy."  And
you look at that guy, and he's got it worse than you!  And it makes you feel
better that there's somebody that's got it worse than you.  But think of the
last guy.  For one minute, think of the last guy.  Nobody's got it worse than
that guy.  Nobody, in the whole world, that guy, he's so alone in the world,
that, he doesn't even have a street to lay in for a truck to run him over.
He's out theeerre, with nothing.  Nothin's happening for that cat.  And all
that he has to do to, create a little excitement in his, own life, is to bum a
dime from somewhere, call up the FBI, say "FBI?" they say "yes?" say "I dig
Uncle Ho and Chairman Mao and their friends are coming over for dinner.",
hang up the phone.  And within two minutes, and not two minutes from, when he hangs up the phone
but two minutes from when he first put the dime in, they got 30,000 feet of
tape rollin'.  Files on tape, pictures, movies, dramas, actions on tape.  But
then they send out a half a million people all over the entire world, the
globe, they find out all they can about this guy.  'Cause there's a number of
questions involved in this guy.  I mean if he was the last guy in the world,
how did he get a dime to call the FBI?  There are plenty of people that aren't
the last guy, that can't get dimes, he comes along and he gets a dime!  I mean
if, if he had to bum a dime to call the FBI, how was he going to serve dinner
for all those people?  *How could the last guy make dinner for all those
people?*  And if he could make dinner, and was gonna make dinner, then why did
he call the FBI?  And they find out all of those questions within two minutes!
And that's the, that's the great thing about America!  I mean, this is the
only country in the world, I mean well it's it's not the only country in the
world that could find stuff out in two minutes, but it's the only country in
the world that would take two minutes for that guy!  Well other countries
would say "Hey, he's the last guy, screw him!", you know?  But, but in America
there is no discrimination.  And there is no hypocracy, 'cause they'll get
anybody.  And that's, that's a wonderful thing, about America.
And that's why tonight, I'd like to dedicate it to every, FBI man in the
audience.  I know, you can't say nothin' you know.  You can't get up and say,
"Hi!", you know, 'cause then everybody knows, that you're a FBI man, that's a
drag for you, and your friends!  They're not really your friends, are they.  I
mean so you can't get up and say nothing 'cause otherwise, you got to get sent
back, to the factory.  And that's, that's a drag for you and an expense for
the government.  And that's a drag for you.  We're going to sing you this Christmas Carol.  It's for all you bastards out
there in the audience tonight.  It's called 'The Pause of Mr. Claus'.   Why do you sit there so strange
Is it because you are beautiful
You must think you are deranged
Why do police guys beat on peace guys?
You must think Santa Claus wierd
He-e has lo-ong hair and a beard
Giving his presents for free
Why do police guys mess with peace guys?
Let's get Santa Clause 'Cause
Santa Claus has a red suit, he's a communist
And a beard and long hair, must be a pacifist
What's in the pipe that he's smoking???????
Mr. Claus sneaks in your house at night
he must be a dope-fiend, to put you uptight
Why do police guys, beat on peace guys?
What can I say?  We have alot of fun.

If you've heard rumors about Amway being a cult, it's true.  It's part of the

I caught an Amway employee (works in Ada and everything) on a music list
engaging in the censorship of the messages in that band's music.
But first, a who's who of the people involved in the war on the Arts/Music -
You'll notice Mr. and Mrs. Richard DeVos of the DeVos foundation listed, his
son runs Amway, and Richard was the guy who started it (along with another

Of course, I do admit, that I do speak from a left POV. ;-)
You see, the band is a band called Camel, and I like to talk about their
lyrics.  One song's lyrics I posted was this one -

Basicly, Russell is part of a right-wing gang working the Camelogue list.  It
is documented here -   It's called
The Humpheads.  When you get the the code - "&y", though, haven't updated
that.  Here's something I snuck to the Camelogue list -
3) Fish.  X-tian fish.  You can find a real one here on &y's server (if not in
the supposed user's address ;-) ) - But these guys don't like to do business with folk other than their own,
that's why they use that symbol.  Here's where &y's X-tian fish is - "&y".
Take the & and remove the top loop of it in your mind, and it certainly looks
MUCH like an X-tian fish!
That's how I found &y's picture, I looked for that symbol on his server.  You
see, his compadres know what to look for.  Can you say "right-wing
conspiracy"?  Sure, I knew ya could!
&y (Andy) Burnett is the "moderator nazi" (his words) of that list.  He has no
real info about himself on his facad server - Roadkill Consulting
(  But he had a picture stashed (in a 5 meg movie) in a
place that only his right-wing buddies (or someone observing the right-wing
conspiracy) would think to click.  On one of his supposed user's boring pages
at the very bottom in fine print where he thanks "&y" for his webspace, and
the "&y" is a link. So, if you also see a bunch of evidence against folk other than the Amway
employee, remember, that Amway employee is part of a gang, and that
accomplices in crimes are JUST as guilty as the actual trigger-person,
therefore, you need to know what his compadres are also doing.
