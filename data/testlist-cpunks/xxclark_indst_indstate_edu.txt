@_subject: Smaller PGP source archives 
Anyone know of an ftp site with the latest PGP source in two
   smaller files, rather than one large one?
        No Unix account and insufficient disk space on this end at the
   moment.
        Any help appreciated.

According to nobody at alumni.cco.caltech.edu:
        PGP 2.2 runs without a hitch on at least one 10 MHz+ XT
  box in which the 8088 was replaced with an NEC V-20 and an 8087
  co-processor added when new... about six years ago.
        Probably far more XT boxes running, worldwide, than some
  are capable of imagining.
        Key generation on the XT is as exciting... and as fast...
  as a baseball game, but who generates new keys daily?
        Encryption speed is more than adequate.
         Not so high a brag-ability index as its companion box,
  a 486/66 EISA... but to use that machine for encryption seems
  an utter waste of processor power.
         `Course, if one can only afford a 486, I suppose one
  must make do as best one can...

        Last I knew, "Secure Clear" is simple frequency inversion, and can
   be defeated by:
                   a $15 kit added to a scanner, or;
                   tuning the freq on a single sideband receiver.
        I've even heard of individuals who had trained themselves, or
   been trained, to understand the freq inverted signal.
        Check out Cincinnati Microwave's spread spectrum frequency
   phones. I don't know if they use frequency hopping or direct sequence,
   but they may be secure against all but military and LEA types... and

@_subject: Canon copier engine 
Read something like this in either Electronic Design or Electronic
   Products, within the last nine months. Sorry, can't cite.
        Claims were for the _new_ color Canon copiers to be sold beginning
   1994.
        The article claimed the memory of the copier held representations
   of all major paper currencies. Any attempt to copy would produce only
   a black rectangle in stead of a bill.
        The worrisome item was the statement that the copiers would add
   some sort of unspecified marking to each copy made, allowing copies
   to be traced back to their source.
        No details on the latter, of course. Don't recall if there was
   even a hint of invisibility.
        With the SS concerned about money funnier than that we use each
   day, I had no trouble believing in a machine capable of currency
   recognition.
        What I could never decide to believe without proof, however,
   was the marking/traceability claim.

@_subject: Canon copiers 
Called a Canon copier dealer today. Here's what he said regarding
   the copying of currency [only after my convincing him I was not inter-
   ested in a career in funny money]:
        All Canon color copiers have _always_ marked their output with
   the serial number of the machine on which they were produced. [I failed
   to ask about non-color copiers.] He mentioned, specifically, currency,
   photographs and food stamps as examples of copied items from which the
   serial number could be recovered by Canon.
        Canon color laser copiers CL-300 and CL-500, not currently being
   produced, but still available, do _not_ have the anti-currency device
   included. They _do_, he said, place the machine serial number in copies
   made.
        Canon color laser copiers CL-350 and CL-550 _do_ have the anti-
   currency device included, which he said is a black box to local repair-
   men. He continued to say that not only would these models, when given
   currency to copy, produce only a black rectangle, but also:
        - store a copy of what one had attempted to copy in memory, and;
        - lock the machine in such a manner that only someone from the
          Canon factory "might" be able to render the machine useable.
        These machines also place the machine serial number in copies
   it allows to be made, he said.
        Only on the last item did his answer seem uncertain. His first
   response was that "the machine would be virtually destroyed."
        Anyone want to test this for us?
        He _did_ suggest which Canon copier would do a good job copying
   currency.
        I still haven't found the trade mag in which I originally read
   this...

Extract from EFFector Online Volume 6 No. 1
        "... The briefers admitted that the proposed system is not really
 an escrow.  The agencies holding the key components will not have any
 duties or responsibilities to the Clipper users.  The escrows' obligation
 will be to the government, and they will be liable to Clipper users only
 under the Bivens doctrine, where any failure must be shown to be wilful.
 ..."
        If it isn't really an "escrow", why do we continue to use the
   term?
        If keys are, in effect, surrendered before the fact, why not
   call it the "key surrender system" when we write or speak about
   this miasma? Or any other term more nearly accurate than what it
   is not...
        Haven't seen a single post promoting tax evasion all day.
