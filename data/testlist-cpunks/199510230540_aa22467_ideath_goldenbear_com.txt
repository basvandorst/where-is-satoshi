Was at a party Friday night and ended up having a few beers with a friend who works at a medium-large software publisher.  Turns out his
company recently received a letter from Netscape to the effect that
"we've noticed that there are 'x' copies of Navigator active
at your site - you should remember that commercial use requires a license fee", etc.  The friend didn't know if the count was per IP
address or per "magic cookie installation" (see discussion of a few weeks prior) or some other metric.
Not that getting paid for your work is evil, but it looks like Netscape's
interest in the use of its browser goes beyond simple curiosity or the
sales of advertising to third parties. Is the bean counter number sent to every site, or just to .netscape.com
