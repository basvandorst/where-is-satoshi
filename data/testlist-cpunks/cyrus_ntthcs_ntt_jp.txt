Pynchon may not be as stupid as that. Has anyone gone to check up on Mr.
Vineland lately? Perhaps the address in the DMV computer is that of a
fried chicken franchise in Lost Hills, CA! Just cause you have some data
doesn't mean it's useful. [Gratuitous Blues Brothers reference to Wrigley Field inserted automagically.]
