It would be a shame to solve all the practical problems and only then discover that your architecture is wrong. :-) That's why I think people are interested in doing thought experiments first. (OTOH, it's kind of pointless to discover the right architecture if you'll never have the resources to implement it right.)
Personally, the TFS paper convinced me to give up on P2P storage until we get FTTH. Wes Felter
