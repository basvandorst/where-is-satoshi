House Rep. Arrested on Morals Charge
Rep. Bob Goodlatte was arrested today for selling PGP at a local
schoolyard.  "Since there has been so much scrutiny on election
contributions, we have to get cash however we can." Rep. Goodlatte said.
It is not known how much money was raised by Rep. Goodlatte in this
fashion.  An unknown accomplice known only as "Truthmonger" is sought by
the Justice Department in regards to this incident.
In other news, Rep. Goodlatte faces a trademark suit from the Starbucks
corporation over his name.  "Goodlatte is associated solely with our
company.  Therefore the use of that name violates our intellectual property
rights.", said a Starbucks Spokesperson.

Some of the site that cookie bomb do so out of ignorance.  Old versions of
Apache have such cookie bombing set by default.  (They changed the name of
the option soon after.  The option was originally called "Mod_cookies" and
people left it figuring that if they disabled it, they could not use
cookies.  Actually it is a method for tracking usage patterns within a
site.  The module was renamed to reflect that.)  I am willing to bet that most of the sites that send cookies are not even
using the data they provide.  Few log file crunchers can make use of the
cookie data from user tracking in any worthwhile manner. Any company that
relies on cookies to hold onto membership information is foolish. (Cookie
files only hold 300 entries.  Surf enough and the membership infomation
gets washed away with the tide.)  Cookies are not needed for storefronts.
There are better ways to accomplish the same thing. (There are CGI
storefronts that save the information on files on the server, for instance.)

This is one of the big problems with PGP currently, BTW.
I pointed out a number of years ago that you could get a complete list of
all keys (and the nyms they were associated with) without any sort of
passphrase. ("pgp -kvv" using the private keyring.)
It was shrugged off as no big deal.  (This was before Carl Johnson got
busted and they used his private key ring to show nym association in just
the fashion I described.)
This could be prevented by encrypting the keyring, but unless it is built
into PGP itself, it is going to make life hard for most people who use PGP
front-ends.  (I can modify such tools, but most people out there are not
As for the "concealing of evidence"...  We are reaching a point where
trying to protect ANYTHING from the prying eyes of the feds will be
considered a "crime". Get used to it.  You will probably have to break laws to retain any shread
of privacy in the future. (Of course, the first rule of not being seen is
"Don't Stand Up.".)
The way that law enforcement has been approaching things is to look for
exceptions where people are able to avoid their grasp and to make laws
and/or regs to cover those "loopholes". ("Be thou the loophole in the
law.")  Any effort to exploit existing loopholes in the law will be seen
as intent to break other existing laws.  (In order to punish you more

They go after pot growers because few of them shoot back.  (Unlike dealers
in harder substances.)  With the seizure laws, these raids become a high

@_subject: Reading List (for the umpteenth time....) 
One of the other problems with reputation capital is that reputation
depends on perspective. The people who I respect and listen to are not always the ones that you
will repect and listen to. reputation is a more individual thing. I think
if you mapped who people found worthy of reputation that it would break up
into a number of different groupings.
And sometimes the reputation capital that someone has with me depends on
the subject.  There are some people I highly regard in the computing feild
that I strongly disagree with when it comes to politics or matters of
personal hygene. [Insert RMS joke here.]
It would be also interesting to see if in the standard Cypherpunkian
reputation capital system how many people's votes would be up for sale.
[Insert Libertarian joke here.] What I would find more useful in that sense is a system that would allow
rating, not for some sense of community barter or whatever, but as a way
to weed out the multiple voices.  When you start communicating with
literally thousands of people, being able to note which are the worthwhile
ones and who are the loons without having to go through a pile of notes
would be useful.  (I have envisioned something like this for my never
finished Mail App, but I keep getting distracted by shiney spendable
objects.) Making that set of judgements avaiable to others is the tricky
part. (There are people whom I regard as friends whom I have to filter
much of what they say. Just because they are friends does not mean I agree
with them. Just where those points are could become... difficult.)
It would be an interesting experiment.
I have considered building an IRC server where everyone is a randomly
generated nym. You can then judge people ny the content of their words and
not by the preconcieved reputation.  (Using certificates to track who is
who.)  You would then be able to rate each nym with whatever rating you
The problems I see in such a design are:
* Multiple accounts (either cooperating friends or tentacles)
* People ditching accounts and rebuilding when their reputation got too
* People who are true on some subjects, false on some subjects and
meaningless on other subjects.
* people who just "play the crowd".
* People who are just there just to fuck up the system.
It would be an interesting experiment.  I have a feeling it would devolve
into a game theory-like strategy game at some point though.  (Or look like
Slashdot, which would be worse.)

I live in portland, OR.  Not exactly small, but to find anything
interesting is difficult to say the least.  (There are a few places, but
the selection is limited and usually quite expensive.)
Then again, some of the things I have found on the net you can't buy even
there.  For example, I have seen at least 40 episodes of "I'm Sorry I'll
Read That Again" available on the net.  There are about eight available on
tape in England.  (According to Amazon-UK.)
Personally I see the whole unauthorized copying issue as a reaction to the
excesive prices charged for music.  Think of it as "market forces" at
work.  (What other option is there?  People have been so indoctrinated
into the idea of having music available 24 hours per day, that can't think
of having anything less than the full fix.)
Interestingly enough, I have seen studies quoted that people who download
alot of music also buy alot of music as well.  (I know I do.)  I am
willing alot less gets spent on "product bands" though. Maybe that is why
the record companies get so pissed about it.

@_subject: MS Product Activation for Windows (licensing) 
Whenever I install a copy of Windows (rare these days), I always copy the
install files to the hard drive.  The reason for this is that half the
time when Windows decides it needs something else, it cannot find the
CD-ROM drive.
This new policy guarantees that I will never buy a Microsoft OS again.
I actually upgrade the motherboards on home machines.  I cannot afford to
repurchace, replace and reinstall every piece of software on those
machines just to upgrade the hardware.
Fuck them! Not for a game machine. (Which is about all that Windows gets
used for around here. That and Eudora.)
This is going to make life HELL for every sysadmin who has to deal with
this crap.  I expect that you will see alot of admins printing the serial
numbers and taping them to the machines.
Microsoft is just trying to squeeze every last dollar from their
customers. Many of them are going to get tired of it and tell them where
to go.

The reason for this is that if the cover is ripped off the book in that
manner, it is usually one that has been "stripped".  That is when a
paperback is reported as "not sold" and instead of sending the books back,
they just send the front covers for a refund.  (Books are heavy and they
figure it is not worth the shipping.)  The books are then supposed to be
destroyed. Some dealers will then sell the books after they have been
refunded in this manner.  (Gotta get that extra profit!)
That is why that warning is there.  It is because the books have probably
already been claimed as destroyed to the publisher and a refund issued.

There is a good reason that there are a large number of Mormons in the

Mormons are taught to obey authority from a young age. They are taught to
obey the government that is in power. They also have a very strong moral
code that is inflicted on them, as well as being taught not to drink or
smoke or have any of those other vices that might make them a risk to
those in power.  They only thing that might keep them out of higher office
is that they are taught to be honest.  (We won't go into the intelectual
dishonesty involved in the faith to begin with, but that is a rant for
another time.)
They also have been taught that the men of the church will save the
constitution in the last days.  (Which has a certain amount of irony,
since most high profile Mormons in public office spend a large amount of
time destroying the freedoms mentioned therein.)

References: <200109301455.f8UEtYV41051
A more appropreate lyric for the situation...
These are the laws of my administration
No one's allowed to smoke
Or tell a dirty joke
And whistling is forbidden...
If chewing gum is chewed
The chewer is pursued.
And in the hoosegow hidden...
If any form of pleasure is exhibited
Report to me and it will be prohibited.
I'll put my foot down, so shall it be.
This is the land of the free.
The last man nearly ruined this place
He didn't know what to do with it
If you think this country's bad off now
Just wait 'til I get through with it
The country's taxes must be fixed
And I know what to do with it
If you think you're paying too much now
Just wait 'til I get through with it...
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair
I'm strictly on the up and up
So everyone beware
If anyone's caught taking graft
And I don't get my share
We stand 'em up against the wall
And pop goes the weasel.
If any man should come between his husband and his bride
We find out which one she prefers
By letting her decide
If she prefers the other man
The husband steps outside
We stand 'em up against the wall
And pop goes the weasel.

The current administration keeps waffling on if this is a war or not.
When it suits their purposes (getting money out of congress, censoring the press, and trampling on the constitution and bill of rights) it is a War.  When it does not suit their purposes (like how they treat prisoners), it is not a War.

Not really.  It depends on what they are exploiting.  Does every piece of code need to be validated all the time? Once a program is running, does something running in its code space get revalidated or soes it just run?
I don't see how paladium stops buffer overflows or heap exploits or format bugs or any of the standard exploits that are in use today.  (Not without crippling the entire system for bot the user and the programmer.)
It seems to change little for script kiddies if the machines are going to communicate with other systems.  (Unless the DRM holders will control who and how you can connect as well.  And they just might do that as well...)
The perveyors of this also claim it will stop spam and e-mail viruses. They only way it can do that is by making paladium based systems incompatable with every non-DRM machine on the planet.  (So much for getting e-mail from your relatives!)
The only problem this hardware seems to solve is shackling the user into what data they can see and use.  If Microsoft follows their standard coding practices, the script kiddie problem will not go away with this technology. It will probably increase.  And it will be illegal to effectivly stop them.

Furthermore, people have come to expect that they should be able to play whatever disc shaped media in their computer.  At some point there will need to be a software based player.
But the real issue is that all of these DRM methods rely on "security by obscurity".  Such methods eventually fail.  Either the actual method is discovered and published or the DRM method fails in the marketplace and is never heard from again.

"There is a fine line between insanity and parody and he has erased that line." - Quote refering to Scott Lively, a member of the Oregon Citizen's Alliance, who claimed that gays were responsible for the Holocaust.
Part of perpetrating an effective hoax is presenting absurd ideas in a manner that people want to believe.
The problem is that every once in a while the people you are attacking with the hoax will make a statement so far off the edge of reality that nothing you can come up with could match it.
"Loyalty Day" fits that category quite well.

Large companies regularly scan their open source (and proprietary code)

"borrowed" from other places.  They also have open source tools that do
similar things.
The idea that open source is filled with stolen code is FUD.

Amazon carries isolation pouches for cell phones that work very nice to
