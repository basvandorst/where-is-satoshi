Don't post irrelevant stuff here.
I've noticed an awful lot of crap posted from the replay remailer
to this group over the last few months.  Wish I could figure
out who this jerk is.

In some areas they may be a tad more liberal, but in general they
are not.  They do indeed have laws preventing freedom of speech
(especially with regard to right wing politics, the holocaust etc.)
Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that all German ISPs
do not carry various political/controversial newsgroups such as alt.revisionism due to legal reasons.
A more serious problem for those of us in EU countries is that the German government have influence on other EU states - only a week or
two ago they tried to push through European wide legislation
restricting freedom of speech.

@_subject: e$ seigniorage (and is this the cost of untracability?) 
I think you're both right - Seignorage is the interest on the difference
between the cost of producing the token and the face value of the token
from the time the token is issued till the time it is redeemed.
In the case of most government issued currencies though, the tokens can
never be redeemed, so the total interest will be equal to the difference
between the cost of manufacture and the face value.
It is interesting to note that casinos could earn seignorage on their chips
in circulation, and issuers of book/record/gift tokens will certainly earn
seignorage on their tokens in circulation, and since these different types
of token money reduce the amount of government currency in circulation,
these earnings will be at the expense of the treasury.
Sure, and this is equally true of cheques and credit cards replacing
government currency.  As to whether the government is concerned, that is
subject to debate.  If so, why all the government attempts at reducing
cash transactions?
For e-cheque systems, the beneficiaries will be the consumers, in that the
money which was previously in their wallets will now be earning interest in a
bank account (assuming of course that the bank passes this benefit onto the
customer).  In the case of ecash (from DigiCash), however, the withdrawal
of ecash from an account is done some time previous to it being spent and
deposited, therefore the ecash is "in circulation".  In this situation, the
ecash issuer will earn seignorage on all the circulating ecash.
Two questions arise:
    - What will be the typical time between the withdrawal of ecash
    - Does the untraceability of ecash (of all types) rely on a time delay
      between withdrawal and deposit (I guess it does), and if so, is the
      interest that the consumer inevitably loses (and the ecash issuer gains)
      the price the consumer must pay for untracability of transactions?

Interesting note - I think that if the time between withdrawal and deposit
ever reaches zero, then we have a e-cheque system (which is fully traceable).

It's even sillier over here in Europe, and the paperwork is probably
a couple of order of magnitudes more expensive (due to the translations
required).  Quick example (but old figures) - the EU spends $10 million
a year to campaign against smoking, and then spends $1200 million a year
to subsidise tobacco production.
Thought for the day - Think about what the 'S' in IRS stands for.

I'm sure you're right.
Perhaps, but only to the extent that you could win what others have lost.
These machines only ever pay out a percentage of what is put in - it is
not possible to beat the machine (long gone are the days when the designers
calculated all the probablities and relied on "the law of averages" in
order for the machine to win).

Surely the process of counting up until you get a prime means
that the chances of getting certain primes are greater than

Agreed, but it's precisely the sort of thing that is misinterpreted
by prosecutors and has to be resolved by a judge after a potentially
long stay in prison whilst awaiting trial.  (All depending on
circumstances of course).  Too close for comfort I'm afraid.
I think the following is a tad better:

impede, or prevent) the communication of information (in furtherance

@_subject: steganographic trick 
It's funny you should joke about this.  A good friend of mine was under
serious investigation for a crime which he was not involved with, simply
because he fitted a profile.  His house was raided and he was under
surveillance on and off for 9 months.  During the house raid the cops
took away a "suspicious" disk (containing an encrypted (although not PGP)
file).  During the 9 months he was sometimes "tailed" by up to 6 cars,
and they had fitted a radio locator to his car.  They spent nearly
$500,000 investigating him, and also blew their local computer budget
trying to crack the encrypted disk.
He knows all of this information since he became friends with the
investigating officer after it became clear that my friend was innocent.
After my friend was told about their efforts to crack the disk, he showed
the investiagting officer what the encrypted file was - a .gif of Mickey Mouse!
(Note to skeptics - this is no UL - this was a good friend of mine)

This is an unfair analogy.  Now if you had said that you rented cars
without asking for proof of identification, thus making your car hire
centre very useful to robbers, that may more closely resemble the
anon-remailer situation.

I was thinking of something much simpler,
This of course assumes that the remailer runs as a process - if it doesn't
then there is no reason a 'remailer helper' cannot.
The only disadvantage of this is that the remailer cannot be rebooted
without a passphrase being entered, but then there are ways around this
(entering the passphrase remotely over a secure link etc., or more
sophisticated 'remote authorisation' systems).
The advantage of this is that the password is never on the disk,
only in memory (which will take serious (read "expensive") to extract).
I am amazed at all of the talk of smart cards etc., when all that is
really needed is a password entered at boot time.

@_subject: Leahy bill nightmare scenario? 
I didn't initially use the the car-hire analogy, I was just trying to
bring it more into line with the anon-remailer situation.  Perhaps a
better example would be an agency set up for the sole purpose of hiring
cars on behalf of anonymous customers - as long as the customers didn't
abuse the anonymous facility too much, then I guess they would be allowed
to carry on operating, much like the remailers operate at present.
However, I guess they're in for trouble when their service starts being
abused at the expense of big brother, and I guess their policy of shredding
all evidence at weekends won't help matters either.
But this doesn't match the remailer scenario - this example is better
likened to me letting you use my email account whilst at my house.
Yes, but when was the last time someone physically mailed copyright source
code (eg RC2) to half the world?  When was the last time a pair of lawyers
made worldwide news due to making a phone call?
Again, the anon-postal-mail/anon-telephone-call analogy doesn't work.

This is especially true in the UK, since the magistrates (the panel of

However, that's not how SVGA CRT's do it.  NTSC (TV video) modulation is done by phase modulation of the 3.579545 MHz subcarrier.  SVGA has three different baseband analog signals feeding three electron beams.
Even so, they still should be able to pick up SVGA with a little tinkering.
