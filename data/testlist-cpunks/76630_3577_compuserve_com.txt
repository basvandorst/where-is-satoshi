Potential First Amendment problems with an encryption ban --
Let's assume that the Clinton administration bans non-Clipper encryption
I then transmit the following and am arrested --
Won't the prosecution be embarrassed when I decrypt it in court and present
the plaintext:
      1st Amendment
      Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
      religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging
      the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the
      people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for
      a redress of grievances.
I don't see how the mere fact of encryption itself fits a message into one of
the 1st amendment exceptions -- pornography, national security, libel, etc.
Since it is easy to establish in information theory that a cyphertext is a
form of *information* itself and not just a *means* of transmitting the
information contained in the plaintext, outlawing the encryption of plaintext
because the algorithm is unapproved is classic censorship of a writing
*because* of its content.
Additionally, there are several types of communications that cannot legally be
wiretapped.  These would include lawyer-client and husband-wife as well as
certain others.  Since the privacy of these communications requires that you
make an effort to keep them private, you could argue that in these cases the
use of secure encryption is legally required.
The crypto-fascists have used these sorts bluffs ever since the late 1920s
when someone was discouraged from publishing a history of the State
Department's code office.  The NSA also threatened to lock up the developers
of the RSA encryption system if they published "A Proposal for a Public Key
Encyption System" in the Proceedings of the IEEE in 1977.  They published
anyway and are still walking around.
Don't let them bluff anyone again.  It is neither legally nor technically
possible to ban secure cryptography.

...telephone communications from illegal eavesdropping.  But the new system is the focus of controversy because the federal government has built in a way for law enforcement agencies to listen to private conversations.  NPR's Dan Charles reports:
You don't usually go to the White House to learn about computer technology.  But last Friday, officials there unveiled a new silicon chip.  The Clipper Chip, as it's called, is programmed to turn electronic transmissions like telephone conversations into gibberish that no one unauthorized listening in can understand.  And it turns that gibberish back into normal speech or data at the other end.  Whitfield Diffey, a senior engineer at Sun Microsystems in Silicon Valley, says this Clipper Chip is an example of the technology of secret codes or cryptography.  "This is in some sense a relatively ordinary cryptographic chip, of which there lots."
Banks, companies, and government officials can use these chips to make sure no one eavesdrops on financial transfers or confidential discussions.  And the government says this new chip will offer more powerful protection than anything people could buy up to now.  But there's another reason why the government wants people to use the Clipper Chip, and it's why a lot of people are up in arms about it.  Every one of these chips will have in its circuitry a unique key --- a very long number
--- that only the government knows.  And if an agency of the government,
like the FBI, wants to listen in, that number will be like a master key that allows them to decode the conversation.  "The mechanism is very much like what the real estate agents do with houses.  Right, they take you to show you a house and they don't have a key to that house in their pockets.  But they get to the house, and
there's a lock box hanging on the front door.  And they have a master key
in their pockets, and they open the lock box, and take out the key to the
door, and open the front door, and go in and show you the house."
The special key that the government holds is like the key to the lock box.
Even though someone using the Clipper Chip can choose their own key to keep
other people from listening in, the chip is programmed to always keep that
changing key inside the lock box, where the government can get at it.  The
reason for that lock box is that the government occasionally likes to listen
in to the phone calls of suspected criminals at home and hostile governments
For the last two years, law enforcement officials have been worrying publicly
that the Mafia or terrorists will start buying powerful scrambler phones to
keep the FBI from understanding their conversations.  The government doesn't
want to ban this technology because, increasingly, legitimate businesses
depend on it.  So the government developed its own version --- the Clipper
Raymond Kammer, Acting Director of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, says it's a good compromise.  "On the one hand you've got a need
for personal privacy.  And I think most of us intuitively understand that and
desire it.  I know I do.  And on the other hand, you've got the right of
society to try and assure itself that it's safe from crime.
But computer scientist Whitfield Diffey, who's one of the pioneers of modern
cryptography, thinks the lock box is a terrible idea.  He says that trying to
deny even criminals the right to a private conversation is dangerous.  It is
something absolutely essential to the functioning of society.  "We are taking a long step towards saying, 'No, you can never be sure that you're going to have a private conversation on the phone.'  And therefore, a real right of privacy only belongs to people rich enough to travel and meet face to face."
Government officials say they have policies in place to prevent abuse.  Law
enforcement agencies will have to request the key for any lock box from two
separate independent agencies, each of which will have only a piece of the key.
This should also make it harder for anyone to steal the keys.  Diffey says the
Clipper Chip will encourage more government eavesdropping, simply because it's
there.  "Technology makes policy," he says, "if the government invests hundreds
of millions of dollars creating a computer chip designed for wire taps, it will
try to take advantage of that investment whenever possible by carrying out
more of them.
The success of the government strategy will depend on people buying the chip.
AT&T will soon be selling a small flat box, half a foot long and about four
inches wide, with the Clipper Chip at its heart.  It costs just over $1000,
plugs right into the cord that connects the telephone handset to the phone
itself.  People who have it can talk to each other in complete privacy ---
unless the government wants to listen in.
This is Dan Charles in Washington.

Not quite.  The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals recently threw out the sell,
and distribute parts of the Child Pornography act on the traditional 1st
grounds that retailers can't be punished for failure to examine (and get the model's age certificates) for every page or every film frame of every item in their inventory.  Such blanket coverage is vague and overbroad.  Who knows what the Supremes or other Circuits not located in San Francisco will do but the state of the law is still fluid.
The question of morphing or animated kiddie porn is an interesting one.  I haven't read the law so I don't know if they would be arguably covered.  Pure *text* kiddieporn is legal of course.  Remember all the battles over text pornography?  Isn't it great that the video/graphics revolution has eliminated most censorship issues concerning pure text.

creates a lot of public outcry.  Linking PGP to terrorism, drug dealing, or kiddie porn would be a great first step towards getting some laws against "unlicensed cryptography" on the books.<<<
Too late.  Open systems are beyond the point of no return.  Worriers
forget the "tipping factor".  Once half of the mass of an object is
above its center of gravity, it starts to fall over fast.
The unsexy bits of the digital revolution - EDI, electronic trading,
the quants, the ISO reference model have already worked their wonders
and started the tipping process.  Perestroika (restructuring) is
here to stay.
Without PGP, without cypherpunks, without UUNET, without any of it
governments would still see their mechanisms of control crumble.  Cheap
computing and telecoms by themselves are enough to render the nation
state technologically obsolete.

A digital cash economy doesn't have to be separate from the regular economy.
        1.)     You mail cash/MO to First Digital Bank of Cyberspace (at an
        maildrop) together with a public (unique if you like) key and anonymous
        address (on Julf's remailer perhaps).
        2.)     The Bank opens an account denominated in the (traded) currency
of your
        choice or a commodity (gold).  There is no reason not to use existing
monies to
        back digital cash.
        3.)     You request digital banknotes and the bank emails them to you as
detailed in
        David Chaum's Scientific American article.
        4.)     You find someone to accept the digital cash.  Initially it can
be used for
        gambling and telecoms/storage fees, eventually buying digital goods
        print, audio, video, VR) will be easy.  Remember, within a few years 100
        homes in OECD countries will have 1.5 megabit lines into them.  This is
a huge
        market for digital entertainment.
        5.)     After a bit of development when the First Digital Bank of
Cyberspace cuts a
        deal with a physical offshore bank, it can issue VISA debit cards and
ATM cards in
        a  Nome de Guerre.  This is already done for large depositors, the nets
make it
        possible to do it for all.  You can then access your account from any
        in the OECD.  Remember money market funds are pseudo banks these days
with VISA
        cards and check writing and all.
        6.)     If you want to close your account, and you can't find any way to
spend your
        money as digital cash, you can have funds wired to a regular bank
account you
        maintain in a Nome de Guerre, have it wired via Western Union with a
code phrase
        because you've 'lost' your ID (for small amounts), have it wired to an
        country bank in your truename and go pick it up in person, arrange a
gold purchase
        from a dealer somewhere and have the funds sent to him by wire or draft
and take
        physical delivery of the gold.  (There are many other techniques known
to privacy
        experts).  Eventually there will be plenty of moneychangers on the nets
happy to
        take your digital cash.
Most money is already digital.  The digital cash technology just gives us a way
to make
easy financial transfers over public networks.  If there is a demand for
transactions over the nets, the money will be supplied.

No need.  This is the advantage of piggy backing a digital cash application
onto an existing offshore financial institution.  It is true that if I sat
in the US and started to offer digital cash accounts I would be subject to
a lot of regulation.
DC would probably be held to be a 'security' and there are all sorts of
financial regulations involved.  It might be possible to get a regulatory
waiver for an experimental system if we got an academic partner like the
Iowa Political Stock Market which also traded 'securities' with account
sizes up to $1,000.  On the other hand, other jurisdictions are not as
regulated as the US is.
Generally, solicitations for unregistered securities cannot be directed to
Americans except in international publications.  I would advocate that all
physical mail involved in such an application be sent and received overseas
(The City of London would be convenient) and that all email be sent via
Julf's remailer.  We could also start an internet DC email group (as a
feedback and semi-advertising medium) sent from Finland.  (Julf willing of
course.)  It would be interesting to see the litigation about whether or
not such a publication is a "domestic" publication.  It should be easy to
find non-US residents to be the nominal "publishers."
Now all we need is a banking haven jurisdiction with good internet
connections...  I *have* been looking.

Nothing.  Just like the First National City Bank of New York or Bank Leu,
Zurich.  You should deal with someone with a rep and perhaps a history.
Obviously the risk of fraud would be greater with a digital cash issuer completely unconnected to an existing financial institution. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  AKA the rich countries (plus Turkey).  The 12 EEC Countries (we can all name them, can't we? %{) + Canada, US, Japan, AU, NZ, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Austria, Switzerland, and Turkey.
That's not a bug that's a *feature*.  Those are the main arguements in *favor* of DC.  The main argument that DC can use against D.C. is that conventional regulatory techniques have been obsoleted by the nets, downsizing effects *all* sorts of institutions not just corporations, and the denizens of the District had better start figuring out what they will do when they are forced to get honest work.

Assume that your application is running (mirrored) on five machines in five different jurisdictions and the machines will lock out one or more of their number if they receive a panic code, or one goes offline unexpectedly, or is not accessed in exactly the right way, you could easily respond to a subpoena duces tecum by stating truthfully that the requested records are not (or are no longer) under your control.
The machines themselves can also be protected by careful choice of location and judicious use of remailers and requirements that they only be accessed by telenetting, etc.
Besides what's the big deal about contempt of court.  If you are worried about doing 2 years or less, locate yourself in another jurisdiction.  No need to expose your body to high risk legal regimes.

But a charge of Sedition is such a rare honor.  It's tough to get the Feds
to bring one.  One Sedition trial during WWII and one against White
Supremicists a few years back.  Feds lost both.  Besides, if the system is
run by non-Americans outside of the US, sedition can't apply (can it? - no
treason certainly).

Dr. Wiles [Andrew Wiles of Princeton University] presented his results this week at a small conference in Cambridge, England, his birthplace, on "Padic Galois Representations, Iwasawa Theory and the Tamagawa Numbers
of Motives."  He gave a lecture a day on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday with the title "Molecular Forms, Elliptic Curves and Galois Representations." There was no hint in the title that Fermat's last theorem would be discussed, Dr. Ribet said.
"As Wiles began his lectures, there was more and more speculation about what it was going to be," Dr. Ribet said.  The audience of specialists in these arcane fields swelled from about 40 on the first day to about 60 today [23 June].  Finally, at the end of his third lecture, Dr. Wiles concluded that he had proved a general case of the Tatiyama conjecture.  Then, seemingly as an afterthought, he noted that that meant that Fermat's
last theorem was true.  Q.E.D.  Duncan Frissell
The bulk of whose experience with Fermat consists of a close reading of
"Mathmateca Fantasia" and other maths science fiction as an adolescent.  Loved the 5 color map theorem as well.

It is rarely to one's advantage to "assist the police."  In fact in British English the sentence "Fred C. Schwartz is assisting the police in their investigation" means that Fred C. Schwartz is the prime suspect.
(Trivia contest for ex right wing nuts - Who was Fred C. Schwartz?)
My search warrant story need not use penet.fi.  In the early 80's I was residing in a rented house in a city located in a region of the country that was once Democratic Farm Labor Party territory.  Being an inveterate reader of the newspaper, I was one day surprised to discover that our house was to be searched by the authorities at some point in the next few weeks.
Specifically, the article said that the houses on  block of  street were going to be searched as part of a survey to determine how many had illegal basement drains.  Apparently the criminals who had constructed much of the housing in that neighborhood in the 1920s had connected basement drains to the *storm sewers* from whence who knows what hideous substances could drain into the navigable waters of the United States without undergoing tertiary, secondary, or even primary treatment.  What's more, they had not complied with the Water Quality Act of 1970, as amended.  Who could believe that such evil exists in the human heart.
My wife (who in many ways was just the sort of female Kipling had in mind when he penned 'Deadlier Than the Male') and I decided to resist this search.  Since I was away during the day, it would fall to here to deal with the authorities.  In due course, a sewer inspector rang our doorbell.  My wife demanded to see his warrant.  He was shocked and mortified.  He tried to talk her into allowing the search.  He used primate arguments like "everyone else is letting us in."  My wife used Northern European arguments like "I'm not everyone else."  He went away.
Over the next few weeks, various bureaucrats called my wife and tried to get her to change her mind.  They said, "You're not going to force us to waste all that time and money and get a warrant, are you?"  She replied, "Consider it a valuable education on the 4th amendment."
Eventually, they showed up with a warrant and some cops just in case we resisted.  My wife took her time reading the warrant.  It said they could search the basement so she led them around to the back door and led them down to the basement where they discovered our criminal drain.
If I hadn't been working 70 hours a week, maybe I would have had fun and tried to quash (not squash) the warrant and explored the modern case law involving regulatory searches - a nasty area.
When we told our neighbors what we had done they said that they didn't know that one could resist a warrantless search.  A good time was had by all.  Quo warranto?
This was also a town where the public and catholic schools all ended summer vacation on the same day.  After that day, my youngest daughter was going about from place to place without apparent lawful occupation when an officious intermeddler asked her why she wasn't in school.  She then told her questioner what I had told her to say, "My father doesn't believe in your schools, he says that they are all dominated by communists."  Shuts them up every time. Duncan Frissell

So call the ACLU and see if they are interested.  Buffalo is a State Uni and subject to the 1st Amendment. Sounds like they are censoring messages based on content (or lack of content in the case of anonymity.  Could the University Post office refuse to accept or deliver anonymous letters?  It is unlikely that a government could force a publisher to reveal the identity of an anonymous author.  There are cases in point in
which people wanted NAACP membership lists where the orders were overturned
on the basis of freedom of association and speech.  Likewise anti-mask ordinances in some cities.  As long as your remailer wasn't causing volume problems, regulation would fall outside the "time, place, and manner" restrictions.  Maybe the Electronic Frontier Foundation would be interested as well.

In another couple of years, the "remailers" will not be *in* buildings but running as distributed processes on machines from Anchorage to Wellington.  Hard to raid.  You will be able to set up your own communications server located "somewhere on the nets" to handle message forwarding to you.  Hard to raid a billion "processes".
This over romatization of government power and violence is peculiar to writers of technothrillers and certain libertarians.  You know who you are.  Government is good at point force.  It can bomb and raid fairly effectively.  This ability to put a mass of organized muscle in the field was decisive in earlier technological eras.  If you are fighting peasants bound to the soil or undisciplined barbarians, a Roman Square could prevail.  Government is less able to apply force on a widespread basis.  It depends on the respect, fear, or acquiescence of its subjects.  If those weaken or disappear governments weaken or disappear.
Markets apply "force" (incentives) across a wide front.  They do not require fear or acquiescence to survive.  They are self-enforcing.  Even commies know trade.
As we become stronger as individuals (I just spent a week's pay to buy more computing power (hardware) than existed on earth in 1955) we have less fear of (others) government and greater capabilities for self-
government.  The "anarchy" debates are beside the point.  If the market is engaged in breaking down hierarchies, the government monopoly cannot stand either.  King Canute cannot order back the sea.  Radical restructuring (peristroika) is on the march.  Strong individuals cannot avoid replacing "others government" with self government.  Others government is only stable when a monopoly institution can maintain control over information and force.  Information and force are becoming widely spread.  We are seeing the collapse of the coercion metaphor at least in its wholesale form.  When people and markets turn away from the state, it disappears.  If its monopoly is broken, we will be in the realm of competing legal systems.

The Feds are *not* going to outlaw encryption.  They believe in encryption.  They even have official bodies designed to encourage encryption.  They are not even going to outlaw encryption they can't break.  They are internally split on the issue.  By the time they got around to actually *doing* anything, we will have been online with a fully encrypted communications system for years.  They can't move fast enough.  They lack the overall control of the networks to implement such a proposal.  There would be First Amendment challenges.  In order for such regulation to be enacted, there would have to be a collective appreciation of the risk that encryption poses to the world's States (it risks their destruction but we won't tell them that).  This is too much of a high order abstraction for a collective decision making process to handle.  We've had powerful encryption techniques for a while in any case.  One-time pads are more than 100 years old, aren't they.  "Publication" in the international realm is not subject to local laws in any case.  International publications routinely carry ads for goods or services that would be illegal to sell in the individual countries reached.  Sometimes a country like Singapore will censor a publication like the Asian Wall Street Journal.  Ridiculous since it can be read online.
Outlawing encryption is a form of censorship and censorship will prove increasingly difficult as time goes on.  If they can't keep crack cocaine out of Sing Sing, how can they keep PGP out of my computer (or computers under my control somewhere in the world). The enforcement problems are staggering.  What about sentencing.  What is the social damage involved in my sending my wife a 2.5K encrypted file.  Pretty petty offense.  Even if encryption was generally outlawed, anyone involved a privileged communication (spouses, attorney-client, physician-patient, priest-penitent, etc.) could continue to use the technology since assuring privacy is one of the technical requirements of exercising such a privilege.
Say, what if I as an attorney operate an anonymous remailer.    I know that privilege probably wouldn't attach because I wasn't a party to the communications but it would make for some entertaining litigation.  No one has yet answered my legal question of several months ago.  If you have an unbroken coded message, how does the prosecutor prove beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty that it is a coded message.  Even if it has identifying headers and footers, that say "PGP 2.2" you can claim that you just put them on to random noise for fun in order to tweak the noses of the authorities.     Duncan Frissell

(Feyd Eli)
The Royal Signals Establishment at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England  is known as General Communications Head Quarters (GCHQ).  It is also called 'Cheltenham' after its location.  It performs many of the same sigint jobs as the NSA.
There was a controversy a few years ago when the US wanted Maggie to outlaw (socialist) union membership by the Civil Service employees at GCHQ because the Regan administration considered it a security risk.
