References: Just because it's a "deadly" (what war isn't?) and "illegal" (Bush's
lawyers would take issue with that) doesn't mean the proper course of
action is to leave.  Right or wrong, we created this mess.  We now bear
some responsibility for cleaning it up.  Once everything is cleaned up,
he's right: we should leave immediately.  Have we yet fixed the pipelines
that "terrorists" have blown up because of our presence in Iraq?
For some strange value of "real culprits," perhaps.  19 of the "real
culprits" are already dead, and who knows how many with some knowledge of
the attacks are already in prison.  From what I've heard about the way the
cells operated, Atta had primary control over the details of the plan.
Osama just had to approve it.  Osama probably deserves to die for his role
in various attacks, but is he a "real culprit" of 9/11?
