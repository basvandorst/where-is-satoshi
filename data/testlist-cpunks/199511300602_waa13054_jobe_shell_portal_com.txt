@_subject: key for Alice as promised (not) 
Alice here ...
Sorry to follow up on my own post, but I made a boo boo.  A real, big
boo boo.
Actually, I made a big mistake here.  It's not good enough for me to
call them.  Usually I have them first call me, and then I call them
I learned to do this in real-estate when I had my property management
Very often, someone would call the office, and say something along the
lines of "This is Constable Acheson, from the Calgary City Police.
Could you please tell me the forwarding address of your former tenant,
Alice" (or Bob, or whatever).
My standard response always was to ask for whoever identified himself
as "Constable Acheson" to provide his division.  Then I'd hang up,
check the number for the main switchboard in the phone book and then
call him.  This way, I'd be sure it was actually him, and that he was
calling from where he claimed.
You'd probably be surprised (or maybe not) how many times, there was
no such Constable.  Luckily, I just didn't give out my information to
just *anyone*.
And the same stuff applies here ... with reading and verifying the key
over the telephone.  With the phone call there should be a hangup and then
some third-party authority to confirm that the channel of communication is
*really* a valid channel. Sorry, about leaving that part out.  It was a boo boo, eh?  But it's important, RL stuff.
Yep, it was the real me this time ... and no, I didn't add another
"signature" encrypted or not encrypted to the bottom of this post. Let me ask this though??  Would the "quality" of my post changed one way
or another, if this was signed, or not?? IMHO, the message should make sense (or not) either way.
                           ... Alice ...
