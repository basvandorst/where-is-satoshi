SUPPLEMENTARY PRE-PUBLICATION NOTICE
"AID AND COMFORT": Jane Fonda in North Vietnam
During the Viet Nam war, Jane Fonda journeyed to Hanoi.  She met with senior Communist civilian and military leaders, held press conferences, toured sites of alleged bombing, "interviewed" American prisoners of war, and, most important, made a series of  propaganda  broadcasts.  Did Hanoi Jane commit treason?  By examining her childhood motivations, her radicalization, her POW "audience," her activities in Hanoi, and through a detailed analysis of the American law of treason, "Aid and Comfort": Jane Fonda in North Viet Nam makes the case that more than sufficient evidence existed to indict and convict Hanoi Jane of the crime of treason.  In addition, the book reveals the shocking story of how the House Committee on Internal Security and the United States Department of Justice swept Fonda's conduct under the bureaucratic rug so that she would never be indicted.  The appendix to the book includes the text of all Fonda's broadcasts in North Viet Nam.
