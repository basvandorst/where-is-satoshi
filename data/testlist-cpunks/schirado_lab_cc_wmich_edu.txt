A concise and thought-provoking article, Tim; I've missed your presence
on the Extropians list since your departure. Glad to see you still in top
Always keeping in mind, of course, that these are merely theoretical
exercises, correct? The idea of crossing a bridge when you come to it is
fine, but we're talking here about bridges that don't exist yet, and
won't without a lot of effort on our individual parts. The building can
never be built without a solid foundation.
I haven't been able to track down a copy yet, although I've read all of
Vinge's other works by now. (His future version of the Net still seems
all too possible. "Death to vermin", indeed!)

I think your post sums up the possibilities of cryptoanarchy to empower
individuals quite well.
My one bitch at this point is that privacy in the real world is so much
harder to achieve than in the virtual world of cyberspace.

@_subject: PROGRAMMING: Assessment wanted. 
I'm not a programmer, so this is all over my head. I'm just
throwing this out as a public service. I will forward mail
to the original author.
If a subscriber has the time and interest, I can supply them with
sources to build a new public key cryptography system based on
unpatented and UNPATENTABLE (because they are already published)
cryptographic systems which have an entire level of better security
than that RSA rubbish. So far, it appears that keys in the
neighborhood of 100-200 bits are equivalent to the "600" bits for RSA
and the "military grade" claims of 1024 bits (PGP) should be easily
doable in around 300-400 bits.
Requirements: You need to either have a good grasp on finite
mathematics (fields, rings, and such..just a basic understanding is
all that is necessary) or willing to spend the time to learn it (about
a week if you are already math-inclined).
You need programming skill too (of course).
I would also recommend that you use a different compression system
from that LZ-based stuff that half the world is using in favor of
higher order Markov tree things (I will supply complete references for
this too).
I am doing this because I have the necessary information but lack the
time to develop this project further.
Okay, for a good overview paper of doing it in hardware (the software
solution is also possible..just that you can't do it quite the
same..online that is), see _An Implementation of Elliptic Curve
Cryptosystems Over F-2-155_ , IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in
Communications, Vol. 11,  June 1993 (page 804).
Essentially, nonsupersingular elliptic curves over the finite group of
characteristic 2 become reducible to the discrete logarithm problem.
Watch when you are looking for papers and doing the research for stuff
by Neal Koblitz..he really knows his stuff and wrote a very good
introductory book to finite arithmetic and cryptology, although the
elliptic curve system in the book was written before the hole in the
supersingular case was known.
Elliptic curve cryptosystems appear to be the strongest known public
key cryptosystem on a per-bit basis in existence. The algorithm is
still horrendously slow (just like RSA-based stuff) so don't expect to
be doing the encryption/decryption in real time unless you're building
it in hardware.
The paper mentioned above has all the references you'll need. Use a
good solid block cypher for actual encryption and just encrypt a seed
using the public key stuff. Do us all a favor and publish it in
library as well as full-blown software package form and allow for
plug-in encryption modules as well as key management systems so the
software doesn't have to be done all over again each time. Same with
any compression software you put in it.
As far as compression (lossless) goes, you'll have to search for the
papers on that because my copy appears to have been borrowed and not
returned. Look for "Prediction by Partial Matching" or "PPM". This is
a multiple-order Markov solution which does better than the LZ-based

1) In non-mathematical terms, if possible, what difference does this
   make in terms of security?
2) Does anyone know why is this undocumented?
3) What changes did you make? Sounds like it would be a well-received
   set of patches to be made public.
(I'm well aware of the current arguments regarding algorithmic strength
being no substitute for secure key management; I'm merely curious.)

1) What involvement, if any, does Phil Zimmermann have in the creation
of this "new version of PGP"?
2) Will "PGP 2.5" continue to be freeware; i.e., has RSA changed its
stance on licensing?
3) If the answer to 2 is "yes", has the strength of the encryption
been compromised in any fashion?
4) Isn't this some sort of transparent "back door" grab by some
unknown person(s) as a method of encouraging people to switch by
fostering the belief that versions of PGP lower than 2.4 are somehow
illegal or otherwise illegitimate?
(The last is only semi-sarcastic.)
Basically, I think I speak for a hefty chunk of list subscribers when
I say: I want to know who's behind this.

Okay. "Writing code" is the activism of choice here, as opposed
to speaking out, spreading the word to Joe Sixpack, etc. No
First: There have been many non-code discussions over the last
few months, many of them begun by respected list members (Tim
May, Eric Hughes, etc).
Second: If something is posted to the list that you find stupid,
you all SAY that we should just ignore them. But of course, you
post this itself to the list at large. Which prompts another
round of go-between, attack and counter-attack. You say that the
"clueless" need to get thicker skins? Pot calls kettle black,
film at 11.
You accuse the clueless of wasting time and bandwidth, and then
perform the same thing (in a far superior fashion, of course,
since your spelling and grammar skills show you to be a better
person anyway).
In a nutshell: If it's not related to the list, DON'T POST IT.
Take the crap to e-mail.

@_subject: PGP 2.5: Mini-review 
Having not seen any activity on the list for the last week or so (I hope
everyone's busy writing code!), I figured I'd simultaneously check to see
if the list still existed, and share some interesting excerpts from
NEWFOR25.DOC, from the PGP 2.5 MIT-legit package.
PGP 2.5 is apparently still written by Phil Zimmermann - at least, it
purports to be - which in itself is a considerable relief to those of us
who had no idea who was responsible. The source code is also available,
as before, and I'm sure programmers the world over are even now poring
through it in minute detail, looking for backdoors and such. I also
expect we'll be hearing from them relatively soon, to tell us of the
presence or absence of any suspicious code.
Not being a programmer myself, I can only comment on a few aspects.
First, there is this:
I recall someone mentioning at one point that increasing the size of a
key beyond 1024 bits did not justify the increased computing time, but I
do not recall the reason why. I believe the reasoning was not that it
offered no additional security, but rather, that it was already difficult
enough to crack 1K keys, and if you're really that worried about security,
you should be tightening up in other areas, such as deciding who to trust
and who not to, deciding what information to enter into the computer and
what to keep in your head, or maybe making a homemade TEMPEST shield. :)
I'd still like to see the math explained a little better, though.
Also, has anyone found those references to elliptic-curve crypto? The
original article is _An Implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems
Over F-2-155_ , IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, Vol.
11,  June 1993 (page 804). (Schneier mentions that Next Computer's
Fast Elliptic Encryption, FEE, uses elliptic curves, and is patented by
R E Crandell, USP# 5,159,632,27 October 1992.) Also, look for works by
Neal Koblitz.
So even though the keyservers only have 5,000 or so registered users,
there are enough people out there using PGP and NOT registering their
keys with the servers that this extra bit of coding was necessary? Hmm.
24 bits gives us 16,777,216 unique ID's. 32 bits gives us 4,294,967,296.
Are there really over 17 million PGP'ers out there, or is my math-impaired
brain missing something painfully obvious?
Which would seem to indicate that PGP is mainly being used for e-mail!
So, all in all, PGP 2.5 would seem to be more than just a possible
conspiracy by MIT/RSA/et. al., and more than just minor bug fixes that
most people wouldn't care about. With the possible exceptions of the size
limitations on keys, and whatever arcane pieces have been hacked out of
the RSA code to comply with whatever demands they may have made, PGP 2.5
appears to be a legitimate upgrade, with more than a few bugfixes, both
major and minor, as well as the all-important improved security (as far
as can be seen).

Yes, physical resistance to authority is, more often than not, a bad
idea, and hopefully most of us know why (even if you're right and even
if you're being attacked, they're not above planting a gun/drugs/other
thing on you to justify beating/killing you).
But the Supreme Court has said, most emphatically, that there is no
"requirement to identify oneself", regardless of whether an officer
has probable cause to stop and question the individual. Brown v.
Texas, 443 US 47 (1979).
I'd repost the relevant excerpts from this great case again if I
hadn't already posted it so many times to so many different fora.
Suffice it to say, regardless of whatever else may be at issue, the
"ruling establishment" (i.e., the highest legal authority in the
country) has stated that there is no requirement to identify oneself.
Just had to get that off my chest. We now return you to our regularly

Tim May writes all sorts of stuff, and concludes:
I only disagree in the most trivial sense with this point. If you
weren't required to re-establish your excludes every time they expired,
it might not be such a hassle.
A secondary concern is that some net users do not have very much disk
space available in their account, and would rather not have stuff come
in in the first place.
Once again, I find that if I set up my mailer to delete every C-punk
message except the ones from Tim May, Sandy Sandfort, and Duncan
Frissell, I get by just fine. They end up quoting people enough that
I don't have a problem keeping track of threads. And I'm reasonably
sure I haven't missed anything I might be interested in.

Never say never.
Even coming from Tim, this surprises me just a little. Never
think that government won't do something. The effectiveness
of their 'solution' may be minimal, but billions can be
wasted, and countless lives ruined, before it can be stopped (or
more likely, dammed; once government achieves power, it is loath
to relinquish it without a death struggle).
Some nation's groups of 'leader'-thugs may be in a better
position than others to go for such a power grab at this moment
in time. But any and all of them should be constantly scrutinized
for the inevitable slide down that slippery slope. The "article"
by our pal Martha which the SF Chronicle had the poor judgment
and atrociously swollen cojones to publish, is one of the most
dramatically explicit warning signs of the year so far... and NOT
because the year is yet so young.
And to think, Tim used to be the pessimist on this list, saved only
by the reassurances of Duncan and Sandy... :-S
