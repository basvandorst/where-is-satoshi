@_subject: The Twilight of the Remailers? 
that there be bastion remailers on the end of the chain. Without them, the
"middle-man" concept won't work. I thank the remailer sites the allow the
middle-man to work.
retirement and those that are silently considering retirement, I would
like to announce that the middle-man remailer should be available for
download as early as this weekend. Utopia.hacktic.nl (basement) and c2.org
have agreed to carry the middle-man remailer on their FTP sites. As soon
as I can get the documentation finished, I'll post it.
