Message not delivered to recipients below.  Press F1 for help with VNM
error codes.               VNM3043 -- MAILBOX IS FULL
   The message cannot be delivered because the
   recipient's mailbox contains the maximum number of    messages, as set by the system administrator.  The
   recipient must delete some messages before any
   other messages can be delivered.
    The maximum message limit for a user's mailbox is    10,000.  The default message limit is 1000 messages.     Administrators can set message limits using the    Mailbox  Settings function available in the    Manage User menu  (MUSER).    When a user's mailbox reaches the limit, the    user must delete some of the messages before    the mailbox can accept any more incoming messages.
UNDEFINED-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
True.  But it is a seperate program from email clients which means that anyone
wanting to use Private Idaho has to download it, install it, and learn how to
use it in conjunction with one's email program.  Most people who may have a
need for anonymity have probably never heard of PGP or Private Idaho.  I
think that until remailer functions are actually built into the programs that
people use, remailer use will be rare.
