Look at  for prototype

What type of attack was used in the famous test? Known plaintext? It

Every product I ever worked on started off as a big ugly prototype
sprawled across a table top hooked to all sorts of life support systems.
And not all products are taken to market by those who did the initial
design work. License. For something like we're discussing here I think
the *big* cash outlay comes post-prototype with mask, fab, plastics,
production lines and marketing. Upfront it's mostly neurons.
I expect it would be easier to convince a manufacturer to participate
with a working prototype than it would with only an idea.
No it is not. 500k gates may be too much but I maintain that you simply
cannot trust the Wintel HW, Windows or anything you cannot analyze in
detail and freeze. Besides, people like little palm-sized gadgets.
We all know the magic price points. But is that particular product all
that interesting? Even if peer traffic is encrypted the system can be
infected and can transmit anything ( disk, RAM eg ) to other adresses.
I'm afraid I don't know enough about the networking stuff to feel that a
system can be secured while it is on-line. Now an embedded system for secure e-mail that used a PC as a gateway
might be kind of cool. You drop encrypted attachments onto a driver that
sends them to the unit where you read them. Anything you enter and
encrypt at the unit is presented as a file at the host to be attached
and sent. USB would be plenty quick for that sort of stuff.
You might say that it should be done on the host as SW or on another PC
but we're back to the Wintel HW again. No thanks. I wonder what could be
done with a palm pilot. Are full schematics and BIOS and driver code
available? You *might* throw out everything but and build it there.
You'd want to do some EMI testing.
I still like my SCSI/IDE gizmo for off-line PC's.
Yes, and it needs to be priced accordingly. Although corporations do

Gun talk is amusing. I agree that what is going on with gun law is
disturbing but as far as disagreement with the Reptilians is concerned
power is political. As soon as it becomes violent you've lost. Except in
the event of a full-blown revolution. Then we all lose.
Don't you think that this sort of a poker bluff would be a little too
much even for the boldest thinkers in gov't? The stuff they fear most
would be commoditized and I think, in spite of your point, far more of
it would exist than does now. Marketeers would reduce it to bullet items
on packages but many engineers would deliver reasonable products within
the cost constraints.
Is that why CP exist? Because cryptography has some legal gray areas? I

Unless you have a really fast ( 1 Mbit / s? ) data connection you're
going to want to do some voice compression. The algorithms I've seen
break the audio into discrete time frames and (de)compress frame by
frame. As a point of reference say about 16 bytes for every 33 msec of
voice. Quality roughly follows data rate, of course. This makes a block
cipher seem not so unreasonable.
Block cipher or stream cipher, either way you're going to have to
introduce a latency of _at_least_ a couple of frames to allow for
resends or deliberate out-of-order frame transmission. This makes the
block cipher look like the better choice.
I think that using HW voice compression and a 33.6 modem you could get a
full duplex secure conversation over POTS with a latency in the 0.1 -
0.3 second range and a direct cost in the vicinity of $100. With a
reasonably quick microP any encryption method could probably be done as

expensive, and I think that I could make it look nice on walls.
The cages I've used were framed in wood and had several layers of copper
screening. The mesh was like standard window screen, <.125". There were
two, I think sometimes three, layers. The corners/joints were copper
sheet. The screen was soldered to the corners. The doors were stepped or
beveled and had several sets of fingers - indside edge, outside edge,
perhaps one intermediate. Screen makes ventilation easier. Power should
be brought in through a separate, partitioned, shielded box with
filtering in each partition. Phone lines, same thing. You trust your
apps, os and TCP/IP stack to not rat you out? If not, work off-line
One cage I saw had ferrite tiles on the solid walls to minimize internal
reflections which would cut down on leakage too.
Al foil if it were thick enough would be OK but how do you reliably join
edges? Al has a bad habit of oxidizing rapidly in air. I guess you could
fold edges over several times - seems tacky.
Converting your study is non-trivial. The door would look like crap. You
would need the euivalent of a door over the window. Build one in your
garage. Make it out of sections so you can move it. 6' x 8' seems about
right for a couple computers and some lab equip. Is the cost justified?

@_subject: Grounding 
I really have to disagree about shielding and leakage.
Electricity runs from a high-potential point to ground. If it isn't
it radiates away into space where it can be detected. If the Faraday
isn't grounded it simply acts as a parasitic oscillator and re-emits the
signal from inside, though at a lower amplitude. Remember, charge rests
the *OUTSIDE* of a object so that any charge picked up internaly gets
to the outside surface.
Consider a battery-powered spark gap inside a copper box. Lots of
beautiful wideband noise. I refuse to ground my copper box. I'm going to
suspend it from a weather balloon over Menwith Hill. The solutions to the wave equation inside the cavity have a real part ~0
in the exponent. The boundary condition at the inside surface of the
copper box splices together the solutions in the cavity and inside the
conductor. Which solutions, BTW, have a real component that is non-zero
so the waves are of exponentially decreasing amplitude the further into
the Cu you go ( skin depth, power loss ). At the inside boundary, the higher the conductivity the smaller the E
field at the surface, the shallower the skin depth and the more power is
reflected with less loss.
The amplitude of the internal Cu ( exponentially decreasing ) solutions
at the outside surface determines the extent to which the wave leaks out
because the solution is imaginary again outside. If it helps, the solution looks like the Schroedinger equation solution
for a particle in a potential well when at least one boundary is a
region of finite potential.
Leakage has nothing to do with being grounded since the wave can be
generated without the total charge residing on the surface of the box (
DC potential ) changing at all. What's there just moves around a little,
that's all.
I don't think it takes a whole lot of copper to do the job: the skin
depth is pretty small. A copper screen behaves much like the copper
sheet execept that it deviates as the wavelengths become closer to the
dimensions of the holes. You might say that the resistivity increases
with frequency. It leaks more.
The 1st rule of electrons:
 They always take the shortest path to ground.
 If they can't get to ground they radiate their excess energy away as
 photons.
Oh, for crying out loud! Where did this stuff come from?
I prefer the three laws of thermodynamics in layman's terms:
i)   You can't get something for nothing
ii)  The best you can do is break even
iii) You can't even do that
Works for my checking account too.
BTW - I'm still at a loss to understand what the geology has to do with
RF shielding. Chaff, I think.
BTW^2 - The more conductive the TARMAC the more clutter you'll get

Wrong metaphor for RF energy. It's not water. A ground is not a storm
Imagine two conductive spheres ( earth and moon ? ) and an RF generator
in a box sitting *peacefully* in space. Classical 3-body problem. The DC
potential that exists between any of them has absolutley no effect on a
wave travelling anywhere ( unless you want to get into the topic of
nonlinear materials ). So forget about everything in the scene except
that generator in the box. Shielding consists solely of preventing the
wave from getting out of the box into free space where it can be
detected. There is nothing special about *any* of the DC references.
Earth may be special ( source of women and beer ) but not to a wave.
Besides, chaining my laptop to a giant copper spike in a geologically

It's not a question of a Schroedingers Wave Equation, it's a question of
Maxwell's Equations. Yeah I've got my old copy of Jackson. MTW too, for all the good it did
me. Maxwell's equations can be used to form a wave equation too. I only
bring up the Schroedinger equation because the solutions to simple
particle-in-a-box examples are easy to generate and easy to visualize.
Anyone who even began a decent Physics program should have done many of
these. The probability function for the Quantum example *looks like* the
amplitude for the EM example...analogy is a good tool.
What conductor? The shell is equipotential unless you're trying to play
games with me so there follows there can be no current flow through it
except radialy to the outside of the sphere.
DC, Yes. AC, things are happening.
To solve the diffeq's for an EM wave incident on a conducting surface
you have to make the solutions !inside! the conductor match the
solutions outside the conductor. Only if the conductor is *perfect* does
your assumption of nothing going on inside the conductor make sense.
BTW - the skin depth for Cu at 100MHz is about 0.00026". The skin depth
is proportional to f^(-0.5).
In brief, here's what happens to the wave incident on a copper sheet:
Wave is incident on surface
Most of the wave is reflected
  the better the conductor, the more is reflected
the portion that is not reflected is attenuated in the conductor ( loss
any amplitude on the other surface of the sheet radiates energy.
It should be obvious that, if the conductor is good, there will be very
little amplititude inside the conductor, low loss reflection. Further,
that 4 mils of Cu should provide ~80 dB loss in even the tiny amount
that is not reflected at the inner surface. At 100MHz. I haven't solved
this system for many years and I'm not inclined to go back to it now.
Take my word for it : a little RF can get through a copper sheet but
only a *very* little. It's the finite conductivity that alters the
simple scenario.
Let's walk through it using your model....
The spark gap generates sparks and that builds up free electrons in the
space inside the sphere (whether it is gas filled or a vacuum is
irrelevant). As that charge builds up it will be all of one type,
Now the electrons repel each other and therefor move in a circular
with the spark gap as the center. They strike the surface of the sphere

                  Policy
                  One of the most important, if not the most important
means by which financial
                  institutions can hope to avoid criminal exposure to
the institution from customers who
                  use the resources of the institution for illicit
purposes is to have a clear and concise
                  understanding of each customer's practices. The
adoption of " " guidelines or procedures by financial
institutions has proven extremely
                  effective in detecting suspicious activity by
customers of the institution in a timely
                  manner.                   Even though not required by regulation or statute, it
is imperative that financial
                  institutions adopt "  "
guidelines or procedures to enable
                  the immediate detection and identification of
suspicious activity at the institution. The
                  concept of "  " is, by design,
not explicitly defined so
                  that each institution can adopt procedures best suited
for its own operations. An
                  effective "  " policy must, at a
minimum, contain a clear
                  statement of management's overall expectations and
establish specific line
                  responsibilities. While the officers and staff of
smaller banks may have more frequent
                  and direct contact with customers than their
counterparts in large urban institutions, it
                  is incumbent upon all institutions to adopt and follow
policies appropriate to their size,
                  location, and type of business.                   Objectives Of "  "
                  Policy
                    1.A "  " policy should
increase the likelihood the
                       financial institution is in compliance with all
statutes and regulations and adheres
                       to sound and recognized banking practices.                     2.A "  " policy should
decrease the likelihood the
                       financial institution will become a victim of
illegal activities perpetrated by a
                       customer.                     3.A "  " policy that is
effective will protect the good
                       name and reputation of the financial institution.                     4.A "  " policy should not
interfere with the
                       relationship of the financial institution with
its good customers.                   At the present time there are no statutory mandates
requiring a " " policy or specifying the contents of such
a policy. However, in order to
                  develop and maintain a practical and useful policy,
financial institutions should
                  incorporate the following principles into their
business practices:                     1.Financial institutions should make a reasonable
effort to determine the true
                       identity of all customers requesting the bank's
services;                     2.Financial institutions should take particular care
to identify the ownership of all
                       accounts and of those using safe-custody
facilities;                     3.Identification should be obtained from all new
customers;                     4.Evidence of identity should be obtained from
customers seeking to conduct
                       significant business transactions; and                     5.Financial institutions should be aware of any
unusual transaction activity or
                       activity that is disproportionate to the
customer's known business.                   An integral part of an effective " " policy is a
                  comprehensive knowledge of the transactions carried
out by the customers of the
                  financial institution. Therefore, it is necessary that
the " " procedures established by the institution
allow for the collection of
                  sufficient information to develop a "transaction
profile" of each customer. The primary
                  objective of such procedures is to enable the
financial institution to predict with
                  relative certainty the types of transactions in which
a customer is likely to be engaged.
                  Internal systems should then be developed for
monitoring transactions to determine if
                  transactions occur which are inconsistent with the
customer's "transaction profile". A
                  "  <customer" policy must consist of
procedures that require proper
                  identification of every customer at the time a
relationship is established in order to
                  prevent the creation of fictitious accounts. In
addition, the bank's employee education
                  program should provide examples of customer behavior
or activity which may
                  warrant investigation.                   Identifying The Customer
                  As a general rule, a business relationship with a
financial institution should never be
                  established until the identity of a potential customer
is satisfactorily established. If a
                  potential customer refuses to produce any of the
requested information, the
                  relationship should not be established. Likewise, if
requested follow-up information is
                  not forthcoming, any relationship already begun should
be terminated. Structured Transactions
                  Section 103.53 prohibits the structuring of
transactions for the purpose of evading the
                  currency transaction reporting requirements. Anyone
who causes or attempts to
                  cause a bank to fail to file a CTR or to file a false
CTR is covered under this section
                  as well as anyone who attempts to structure or assists
in structuring any transaction
                  with one or more domestic financial institutions. A
cash transaction in excess of
                  $10,000, which is subsequently withdrawn upon
realization that a CTR is being
                  prepared, should be reported as a possible attempt to
structure a transaction. See
                  also 31 U. S. C. 5324.                   Examiners should be alert to consecutive transactions
involving cash in excess of
                  $10,000. Suspect transactions should be pursued
further. The following are examples
                  of types of transactions that may be reviewed for
possible structuring activity:                     1.Cashed checks - pay particular attention to
multiple items cashed by the same
                       person.                     2.Cash deposits.                     3.Savings withdrawals/certificates of deposit
redemptions.                     4.Personal money orders or official checks sold.                     5.Official checks sold or cashed - look for
consecutive items.                     6.Savings Bonds sold or redeemed.                     7.Traveler's checks sold or cashed.                     8.Loan payments or loan proceeds made in cash.                     9.Securities sold or purchased for cash if the
financial institution acts as agent for
                       an individual and the transaction involves more
than $10,000.

This stuff has been on and off the list for quite some time now. I think
the general opinion is that you cannot trust any software that does not
come with full source code. Especially operating systems ( read :
Windows ).
Furthermore, hardware could be untrustworthy. As an example of the latter just imagine a keyboard chip that takes the
serial data signal, ANDs it with the clock and runs the current-limited
output through a metal loop on the die or couples it to an outside trace
that is not likely to be filtered. Instant keyboard transmitter. Short
range but probably usable. Try it outside the chip, I'll bet an old AM
radio will pick it up pretty well. If you have better receivers try 1x,
3x, 5x ... clock carrier frequencies.
What sort of other things would you design into an OS or a CPU or
peripheral chips if you wanted to snoop? Let the OS do the keysnoop for
you and send it off through the network? Keystrokes seem like the
obvious choice because they are low-bandwidth and have a high
information content but someone who's smarter can probably think of all
kinds of other stuff to send. ls -al > G-buddy. You know, keystrokes are
so low in bandwidth that I bet a receiver/recorder could be placed on
your premises, say behind an outlet for power, and checked
surreptitiously only when needed - how long would it take you to fill a
1Gb drive from your keyboard?
I don't think that there can be real security unless you use embedded
systems ( unknown to the OS and Host HW ) for critical roles and
maintain two machines - one clean in a cage, the other on-line and
without any sensitive information. Use sneakernet between the two using
media that you can readily analyse.
If I can think up a feasible method to do something in 5 minutes it was
probably already done a long time ago and the people who do this stuff
full-time have probably taken the field to amazing heights. They seem to
be able to get cooperation from commercial companies too.
Snooping probably won't be done wholesale, too expensive in terms of
manpower, and I don't know anyone who needs real security but, in

These ideas have been around for more than a few years. In the past year
or so I've seen two systems on Discovery Channel. One was a flat strip
that was unrolled across the road and generated some ESD when the car
crossed it. The other one was a cockamamie toy rocket car that would be
deployed by the pursuing car and run under the pursued. They say it
shows promise.
These things are fine. It would probably require small effort to devise
effective CM. The project solicitation is pretty nasty however: they
very casually talk about high energy RF. I would say pointing that crap
at anyone would come under "reckless endangerment". I miss the days of mechanical ignition points and carbureters!
BTW - Did you see the bullshit that happened up in Vallejo? Cops sent a
dog into a culvert after a suspect. The suspect shot and killed the dog.
The police had a full-fledged funeral, casket and all for the fucking
dog. Flowers all over he place, mourners. Now they're buying goddamned
kevlar vests for their dogs. Fuckheads. Who's the citizen? The human or
the dog?
As for the suspect he's charged with something for killing the dog.
Simple destruction of property, which would be a charge befitting the
act, is probably not enough to avenge beloved Bowser's death. Because
it's a cop-dog-on-duty the penalty is probably more than restitution and
some community service. Jail time for defending yourself against an
attack dog?
I think maybe our society is suffering from a form of mass insanity

Many thanks in advance for your generous and gracious assistance.
Please tell me where I've headed off the proper path.
Without having read any detailed descriptions I thought an AP bot might
do the following :
Form a token pool associated with some desired event.
Accept tokens from any source into that pool.
Transfer the entire pool of tokens to the entity that could demonstrate
foreknowledge of significant details of the actual event outcome.
Couldn't this be more general than just AP? Generalized it could be used
for any collectively rewarded effort but its main application looks like
anonymous conspiracy. This may be good, maybe not. What I was wondering
was if in a very generalized form the server might be "innocent," a mere
public bulletin board.
Also, couldn't a server like this be implemented as a distributed system
that could survive the destruction of some fraction of its body?

Hi Bill,
I suppose we need more altruistic gestures placing good stuff into the

The security is only between the handset and the base unit. Once the
signal hits the POTS it's the same old story - open line.
ALSO - the channels and the hopping sequence used in the
"spread-spectrum" systems are predefined. Kind of like making a stream
cipher with a very short bitstream you got from the government printing
orifice. Using any other sequence is a crime.
The real purpose of the spread spectrum phones is to allow increased

It is possible using external HW to get keycodes and random numbers into

OS font engine. In this way you could create a slightly secure app ( a
mail client for instance ) on an insecure system like windows. It would
still be easily attacked if it were specifically a target but would
probably be immune to any general purpose loggers in either the keyboard
path ( except on the kyb itself ) or the OS font engine. If you think the OS font engine can be trusted then you can create an
app that given a handle feeds the keycodes to any standard application.

@_subject: CDR: Re: stego for the censored 
Since the amount of information you need to send and the channel/event
capacity for stego'd information are unspecified maybe you're looking
for a general solution. Part of a general solution might be a
scatter-gather mechanism.
The information you need to send is broken up into multiple pieces and
an index. The simplest method would be a flat structure but a tree is
acceptable. Redundancy via overlapping segments could be introduced.
Redundancy/error correction might be useful if Mallet is inclined for
example to mess with whitespace in your e-mail. Anyway, the pieces are
stego'd into multiple carriers that are made available via any and all
protocols. Once a recipient has the top-level index they can gather the pieces and
reconstruct the original. Scattering the information over multiple sites and accessing it via
valid sets of linked pages for example might help in disguising the act
of retrieving any particular carrier. A typical browse sequence might
include many unused files and only one carrier. A single carrier might serve various fragments from multiple original
input documents intended for different recipients. If a single carrier is safe and acceptable a webcam might be a nice
broadcast for a few channels of text. It does simplify the task of
identifying the sender and making a list of possibly recipients. A
shifting set of sources would probably be safer.
Message fragments could be transmitted over any period of time with the
top-level index being the final step. That would help the sender avoid
detection of the actual transmission since it could be interleaved with
other activities.
Likewise reception could be over an arbitrary period of time and
interleaved with other activities.
There's a high bandwidth cost associated with the scatter-gather process
but it does allow arbitrarily sized messages and I'm assuming the cost
of getting caught is extremely high as is the desire of authorities to
view content, locate the sender or other recipients and suppress the
information if it is detected.

These regimes are likely to suspect conspiracies whether or not they are

will be applied whether there are secret messages or not. If you want to
actually communicate then you have to risk SOMETHING.
Scatter-gather is just a mechanism to handle arbitrary sizes of messages
and add some potential cover traffic. It is no less safe than any single
exchange of stego data. Possibly it is more safe since the data density
in the carriers can be made very low and an observer cannot easily
isolate a complete carrier set from the cover traffic.

Get with the program Bob, they're not "warrantless searches", they're
searches (AKA fishing expeditions) conducted pursuant to an
"Administrative Subpoena."
Which seems to be very common in child support legislation, EPA,
Financial Institution's production of records, OSHA, SEC, IRS etc...
It looks to me like a weakening of the Constitution in the sense that it
effectively lowers the standard for conducting a search of someone's
effects to the level of an agency rather than a court. Not that courts
are tough to convince. It's truly evil but it addresses many agency's
concerns of getting what they want in a timely manner. I say make them
go through a judge for any and all searches but hey, they have the black
hellicopters don't they?
Here's an excerpt with some familiar equestrians :
Lastly, H.R. 3048 also grants Secret Service the ability to obtain
administrative subpoenas for use in their investigations. The only
agency currently allowed to issue administrative (limited subpoenas
issued by the Attorney General for information), is the Justice
Department. These subpoenas can only be issued by the Justice Department
in relation to crimes involving drugs, federal health care
investigations or the sexual exploitation or abuse of children. The
measure allows the Treasury Secretary to issue an administrative
subpoena for investigations of threats:
     · against the President, Vice President, and their spouses or
immediate families;      · against former presidents and their spouses,      · against candidates for President or Vice President, their spouses
and immediate families;      · against visiting foreign heads of state or other distinguished
foreign visitors protected by the Secret Service. We're right back to the same old issue of forced disclosure of keys.
"Here are the records you asked for but I don't think you'll be able to
make much use of them"...RIP-USA can't be too far away. It's probably
here already since my guess is that should you offer records in
encrypted form any Administrator or Judge would say that you are in
contempt since you effectively have the records in your possession and
refused to produce them. So much for technology.

I'll stipulate that the common citizen, when faced with a tirade about
killing those who perform abortions and a list of names and addresses of
offenders, would not immediately put 2 and 2 together to make 3 and
start killing doctors. Now put yourself in the position of an average
citizen who sees his own name in the list following a tirade about
killing those who drive gasoline-guzzling, polluting, Corolla-crushing
SUVs. I'm sure he would feel threatened. So the site in question is not
the same as a site that simply expresses a political opinion or
distributes instructions on how to create dangerous devices. It is more
like a site that distributes this info and then list specific targets
that should be considered as applications. The site owners took a
concrete step towards carrying out a threat : they gathered and
published personal information. I'm sure the appeal to the jury was
along these lines.
OTOH perhaps you're right that speech of all sorts should have the
highest of protections regardless of how it is perceived by a
vanishingly small number of persons in the audience be they potential
agents or targets. In which case the choice of methods for dealing with
threats would be left solely to the individuals who perceive them.

Until recently the US government strictly controlled the strength of
 cryptography in software exported to different countries, in order
 to protect the government's ability to access and monitor
 communications data. The regulations were relaxed after pressure
 from industry but Madison believes that this may have driven the
 NSA to find ways to carry out surveillance. "They're not going to
 give in over exporting strong cryptography without getting
 something in return," he says. I can't believe that they would voluntarily enter a period of weakend
capabilities. My guess would be that he has the event ordering wrong.
More likely the security types had alternatives in place and this, along
with the easy flow of crypto code over the borders meant that relaxing
the crypto regulations would not alter the landscape. It might even

I am not an optics expert but I DO have a clue. And any coherence in the

What is a laser Jim? LASER
Amplification by the Emission of
An atom in an excited state, ie one that is not in the ground state, may
be stimulated to release a photon by an incoming photon. The most
interesting part of this is that the emitted photon after the
interaction is in phase with the incoming photon and in the same
direction. Get lots of these interactions taking place in the right
medium and you get a river of photons all in phase. That's what coherent
means in optics - in phase.
Check your Webster's and please read the definition that says "3.
Physics. ..."
Go to any optics book. Want references?
Thermal radiation ( what you are imaging with your snooperscope ) is not
coherent by any definition that I know of. You could say that light and an optical system form a "coherent" image
because the image is recognizable but that usage might be confusing
because of the common and accepted use of coherent with reference to
LASER light. Form an image is probably adequately descriptive.
The walls of the house do not "break the coherence." The more
interesting processes that would be going on at and in the walls of the
house would be reflection, scattering, absorption, diffusion( thermal)
and reradiation. These effects would probably vary widely with
construction materials and wavelength. The end result as these
wavelengths are incident on a wall might vary from little or no effect,
through blurring to outright shielding.
What your talking about is reflection, scattering, absorption etc...the
coherence of the light don't enter into it. Go back to your physics boooks Jim. You missed it again on this one.

Decent thread. I still think there is plenty of opportunity for the laws
of mathematics to make other laws moot  but this is interesting.
I have a few, hopefully not useless or inflammatory, comments.
1) The piece of useful information most easily extracted from this
thread is that the best defense is that the "evidence" never existed and
the device lacks the capability of creating it. Is it possible that the
courts could decide that using or designing a device lacking logging
features or that compiling a device from source with logging
capabilities but with those capabilities selectively disabled is in
itself an act of spoliation? These are acts done without any specific
knowledge of people, places, things or events likely to be of interest
to a court. General knowledge of the effects of designing, compiling or
using such a device might be shown.
1a) Isn't there a PA statute prohibiting altering the headers on a
1b) Could a remailer be declared to be a common carrier and subject to
1c) Could a remailer operator be compelled to add or enable logging
features without notifying users?
2) Most of the cites seem to describe cases involving corporations. Is
it reasonable to think that while in theory corporations and individuals
could be treated identically that in practice there are more
documentation requirements on the part of a corporation, especially in
the case of one that produces a product that is sold to the public?
Would the expectations be different for individuals not engaged in
commercial activities?
3) The same technology that is providing all this super eavesdropping
and logging capability is also making it easier to fabricate or plant
evidence. Electronic evidence may seem wonderful to a prosecutor but
aren't we going to have to deal with its vulnerability at some point?
Maybe only after someone with deep pockets gets hurt.

I haven't read the mixmaster source but it seems to me that end-to-end
encryption protects the contents. The traffic analysis part seems
vulnerable on two basic fronts : subversion of a node and overall low
traffic levels. Nested encryption protects a subverted node from being able to trace the

guarantee a matchup of "from" and "to" but it improves the odds.
With low traffic levels through a chain the statistics of traffic

The Honorable Edith Jones has a VERY healthy attitude towards electronic
snooping. IMHO she's outraged.
Is the Washington-mandated snooping part of a power play where the
behavior of the judiciary needs to be monitored and controlled in
real-time or is it incidental to the stated goals of cleaning up office
computer usage?
Now I wonder how Judge Jones feels about snooping on the population in
general? Is she a standout among judges or do those in power feel
outrage only when the abuse is close to home? Do those in power want to
create the virtual version of gated communities and limit the membership

for years.
If you don't have a Faraday cage and a spectrum analyzer and you still
want a rough idea of how noisy your device is you can tune an AM radio
to a vacant space between stations, crank up the volume, and listen for
your device's noise. Turn it on and off, press some buttons, you can
actually make some pretty good correlations between what you hear and
what your equipment is doing. There will probably be some nice configurable SW radios soon. I don't
know about sensitivity or noise problems that might go along with this
but it seems pretty interesting. Maybe someone who knows more could

I think he's probably wrong here - I would guess that the most affluent
and articulate parents send their kids to private schools because
they're too busy keeping the lifestyle financed to run a school or
realize that they would probably suck at it. If I win the Lotto I'll
consider it. I'll risk $1 today.
Funny that, the only people I've ever met who were home schooling their
kids were fundamentalist christians who objected to all kinds of
perceived immorality and wrong teaching like sex ed and evolution. In my
estimation they were poorly equipped to give their children a good
education. I have no doubt that there are many exceptions to what I've
seen but those who will do a really fine job of educating their children
are probably in the minority of homeschoolers.
You mean like when we send young males to war so the ones who stay home
will have less competition?
Keep an open mind about the home schooling/private schooling vs. public
schooling discussion.
One facet that I see is that fundamentalists via a strong influence on
the republican party are trying to divert public funds to religious
organizations. My reading of the 1st is that the state may not establish
a religion. Giving money to a religious organization is tantamount to
establishment. My reading of the 1st also leads me to the conclusion
that the tax-exempt status of the churches is wrong. They should pay
their fair share of the fucking property taxes like every other victim.
Another facet is that the well-to-do are attempting to remove their
funds from the systems so they can use those funds to educate their
children as they choose. A voucher system would surely benefit me
financially. This is a reasonable desire but it will have a negative
effect on the public school systems and a subsequent negative effect on
the society as a whole. I know the masses are a bit thick but do you
want them to be even thicker? And not all bright people come from
priviledged backgrounds. Do you want to limit the opportunities for some
of the brightest kids in the country before they've even had a chance?
I'm not saying that it (vouchers or other defunding) should be ruled out
but you should at least think about the implications a bit. Aimee style question :   How many of you were home schooled?
  How many went to private schools?
  How many went to public schools?
I would guess roughly 1% 9% 90%
I wish there were more ( and better ) educational choices and that those
choices were reflected reasonably in the financial systems but every
proposal I've seen so far sucks moose bladder through a hairy straw.

@_subject: speech + action 
It's not easy to find great links but I still say that speech + action
is something that a prosecutor can use to the disadvantage of the
accused even if the speech is legal and the action appears to be
ineffectual or undirected. Look at how AP was used. 18 U.S.C. 23 1 seems
to link speech directly with the action of paramilitary training, even
if there is no specific target. The speech portion of the offense
enables a heavy response to the otherwise unpunishable action. Whether
or not anyone has been convicted under this statute there it sits, ready
to pounce.
Admittedly these are weak cites but I do think the (
legal_but_unpopular_speech + unpunishable_action = crime ) idea is
embodied in laws. I think eventually it'll somehow get extended to
address the cyberterrordangerouslyeducatedchaosprogrammerdeaththreat
that faces each and every freedom-loving, net-browsing Amurrican today! Maybe the pro bono brigade of the unorganized, non-organizational,
casually associational, non-paramilitary, non-coding, non-militia,
profusely verbal cypherpunks flying circus will chime in with some fun
In 1986, the ADL formulated model state legislation that would ban
paramilitary training "aimed at provoking civil disorder."[104] In
drafting the model bill, the ADL specifically stated that the statute
must not violate First Amendment   freedoms of speech and association.
Another objective was to draft the statute narrowly so that it would not
prohibit legitimate lawful activities such as target shooting and other
sporting events. This was important, the ADL stated, for "minimizing
opposition to the bill by powerful special interest groups." [105] Laws
based on the statute have passed in Arkansas, California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri,
Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, Virginia, and West Virginia.[106]
 - please read
the last paragraph - keeping records of public speech becomes part of
the procsecutor's toolbox - the speech seems to be a necessary component
of the prosecution.
"The current federal paramilitary training statute, 18 U.S.C. 23 1,
punishes only those who instruct others in fomenting violent civil
disorder. Clearly, the statute should punish trainees as well. Similar
statutes have been enacted in at least 24 states. "
 - Read this one and
think about how speech could be used to facilitate indictment.

that does DRM but I do care about having it forced down my throat at the
hands of congressvermin and corporations which, as I see it, is
practically a certainty.
Tim's essay was mostly the familiar stuff, nicely organized and
presented. The style was almost academic but I notice he did slip one
"spokesvermin" reference in there.
So, Tim, we seem to have raced closer if not past the fork in the road,
especially since September. Recalling Yogi Berra's "when you come to the
fork in the road, take it", have we taken it? And if so which path?
The fork analogy may be too simple. The natural path for a vital culture
is the crypto-anarchist path. The path of increasing state control is
the natural path for the maintenance and accumulation of power. We all
see the forces in operation, it's pretty much the topic 24/7. I think
the forces that bind this mess together increase with distance, the more
free the net becomes the greater the perceived threat and the desire to
reign it in. The tighter the controls the greater the desire to break
free. On each side there are those for whom compromise is unacceptable.
In the middle are the nearly oblivious masses who can with varying
degrees of success be swayed one way or the other from time to time.
Fear seems to be their main motivator.
Rather than making a choice and following any single path we are
following two concurrent and divergent paths and the energy level is
increasing. We are headed for a period of escalation. It's definitely a
new 'War on Drugs' scenario, just as dangerous, just as futile and just
as sustainable.

Isn't there anything that can be done about reducing the risks of

Since the assumption is that the attacker sees all of the network

Why not get each recipient who is getting mail for the first time to
sign a waiver of some sort before they can pick up their mail. When an
unsigned user gets a mail they are sent a notification mail explaining
what remailers are, roughly how they work, some of the perceived
problems with what might be sent via a remailer etc. Then tell them how
to sign the waiver and give them a deadline before their waiting message
is deleted. Some signing options might be : propagate to other
remailers, one-time use, expiration date, refuse all mail, delete any
mail w/o delivery code etc...

I guess if your critical server is simply some sort of service provider
and the only data requiring security are the operating keys then your
hostile location is OK since rebuilding a system and restoring a few
keys ( which can be hidden just about anywhere ) is easily done.
Otherwise the loss of the data could be costly. If your data is static then it would be relatively easy to stash a copy
somewhere. If your data is dynamic then backups are necessary. Backups
can be tracked to their resting place. So their location needs to be (
physically and legally ) secure from the threat(s). Unless you can
readily hand carry the backups to the secure storage area it will need
to be connected in which case you might as well locate your server there
in the first place.

Sure but take some dramamine first if you get motion sickness.
Are you implying that the wavelength for incident photons changes upon

The energy loss at the mirror is lost photons not altered wavelengths.
The lost photons have varying fates.

@_author: mmotyka at lsil.com 
@_subject: Attention to detail lacking 
I think you often don't word things carefully enough. The resulting
discussions get pointless in a big hurry.
You stated that every photon interacts, loses energy and is re-emitted. I think the reflected beam has the same wavelength as the incident beam.
Your blurb about absorption and cascades is only true for some fraction
of the lost photons that constitute the inefficiency of the mirror.
Others have a different fate.
Maybe that's what you meant but you did say "every photon."
And here's an exchange with Tim :
The sun produces shitloads ( check your CRC Handbook for conversions
between the shitload and more familiar units ) of power :
says 386 billion billion megawatts If we know the spectral characteristics of the sun ( the black body
spectrum perhaps? ) we could come up with a photon count. I'm not sure
whether you mean to talk about photon counts and adjust the power and
wavelength variables or you really mean to discuss something that
operates somewhere between IR and UV. Let's assume the latter. It is
after all a LASER.
You did say "surface of the sun". To me that means integrate over 4 pi.
3.86E26 W regardless of the radius. I doubt if anyone has made a laser
that operates at that power level even for one fs. Let's try the other approach...
The power output from the sun is about 1350 W/m^2 as measured here.
Maybe that was what you meant as a reference power level. Let's see,
1350 W/m^2 -> 1.35E-3 W/mm^2 so a 1 mW laser with a beam area of .74mm^2
is "as bright as the sun" at least in terms of gross energy density.
That disregards spectral effects. Not too tough to be "brighter than the
sun". I don't think you could even light a bucket of gasoline 1 m away
with it no less knock down a rocket. It's also pretty easy to handle
with a basic mirror. I'd say that's a pretty wussy power level for
something that needs to melt a rocket in flight. Focussed to a spot that
is 1/1000 the area of the parent beam it starts to get interesting but
let's see you hold that spot steady from a 747 in turbulence long enough
to burn a hole in a nice shiny casing going 8000kph 200km away.
So if we're going to discuss physics let's do it with a bit of care.
Maybe it will be more interesting. I'm no expert but I'm willing to try.

`(g) ENCRYPTION RESEARCH-
`(1) DEFINITIONS- For purposes of this subsection--
`(A) the term `encryption research' means activities necessary to
identify and analyze flaws and vulnerabilities of encryption
technologies applied to copyrighted works, if these activities are
conducted to advance the state of knowledge in the field of encryption
technology or to assist in the development of encryption products; and
`(B) the term `encryption technology' means the scrambling and
descrambling of information using mathematical formulas or algorithms.
`(2) PERMISSIBLE ACTS OF ENCRYPTION RESEARCH- Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), it is not a violation of that
subsection for a person to circumvent a technological measure as
applied to a copy, phonorecord, performance, or display of a published
work in the course of an act of good faith encryption research if--
`(A) the person lawfully obtained the encrypted copy, phonorecord,
performance, or display of the published work;
`(B) such act is necessary to conduct such encryption research;
`(C) the person made a good faith effort to obtain authorization
before the circumvention; and
`(D) such act does not constitute infringement under this title or a
violation of applicable law other than this section, including section
1030 of title 18 and those provisions of title 18 amended by the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.
`(3) FACTORS IN DETERMINING EXEMPTION- In determining whether a person
qualifies for the exemption under paragraph (2), the factors to be
considered shall include--
`(A) whether the information derived from the encryption research was
disseminated, and if so, whether it was disseminated in a manner
reasonably calculated to advance the state of knowledge or development
of encryption technology, versus whether it was disseminated in a
manner that facilitates infringement under this title or a violation
of applicable law other than this section, including a violation of
privacy or breach of security;
`(B) whether the person is engaged in a legitimate course of study, is
employed, or is appropriately trained or experienced, in the field of
encryption technology; and
`(C) whether the person provides the copyright owner of the work to
which the technological measure is applied with notice of the findings
and documentation of the research, and the time when such notice is
`(4) USE OF TECHNOLOGICAL MEANS FOR RESEARCH ACTIVITIES-
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(2), it is not a
violation of that subsection for a person to--
`(A) develop and employ technological means to circumvent a
technological measure for the sole purpose of that person performing
the acts of good faith encryption research described in paragraph (2);
`(B) provide the technological means to another person with whom he or
she is working collaboratively for the purpose of conducting the acts
of good faith encryption research described in paragraph (2) or for
the purpose of having that other person verify his or her acts of good
faith encryption research described in paragraph (2).

I'm really not completely clued-in to all of the publishing options but
my gut instinct says that the more rapid and widespread the dispersal
the better. The originator of proscribed information needs to be
anonymous but it seems that if the recipients are many and diverse then
the level of guilt associated with reception can be ameliorated. A mixmaster chain firing the info off into a whole shitload of lists
looks like a pretty good way to ensure that information is not made
extinct. If a DeCSS source+bin zip had been anonymously mailed to 40 million
people the terrain for the legal fight might have been different. I
think JQPublic hasn't yet grasped the absurdity of "illegal information"
and might react unpredictably if told that possessing or forwarding
certain e-mails was a crime. Non-techie people I've spoken with about
the state of affairs flat out didn't believe me.

The larger problem notwithstanding there's at least one little bit of
language in this piece that is odd :
  "He said the government is    seeking all of Leggett's    material, including all    originals and copies."
Even if we make the extreme assumption that there is some pressing and
justifiable need for federal prosecutors to have access to her materials
how do you explain the need to possess "all originals and copies?" It
doesn't make sense. Why should she not be allowed to keep a copy of her
work? How does the existence of an uncontrolled copy lower the value of
the original in the case of a recording? Or in the case of her own notes
why would a copy not suffice.
Looks like a reporter ( or anyone else for that matter ) should keep
well hidden backups of their notes and work so that they can comply with
Napolean complexes, fishing expeditions and spin control operations and
not lose their life's work.

How about placing blocks of data on a safe site? A petit Napoleon would
be able to subpoena a plaintext copy of the data and possibly make a
fight about getting the keys but would not be able to deprive the owner
of the data. That is, to me, the strangest and most disturbing part of
this story considering how easy and cheap it is to make decent copies of
almost anything written or taped. Why should an owner not be allowed to retain a copy?

OKOKOK - stored, not hidden.
 - This is her current predicament - she refused to produce physical
 - Doesn't look so bad - she can produce all physical copies and still
get access to her safe site. Safe is pretty generic, meaning possibly
out of the jurisdiction, out of her control and visible to herself and
possibly others as plaintext or otherwise. Not sure how it is possible
to hassle her if she produces all physical copies as ordered but has
taken steps to maintain future accessibility for her own purposes.
Pardon me for being sloppy about "safe site".
If the motherfuckers want all of the copies they can achieve that goal
assymptotically by downloading the data repeatedly. Disks are cheap.
 - not entirely unlike  really - the data is out of her control.
Only difference I can see is that there is a record of a transfer with a
date prior to the subpoena.  admits of this same solution if blocks of data are mailed to some
safe location on a regular basis. I don't see why some official type of
escrow is required as long as the unsquelchable distribution predates
the subpoena. BTW - would a subpoena such as the one served on the journalist specify
that the contents of the records were not to be communicated to anyone?
Not a particularly useful answer and not necessarily justifiable on the
part of the court. I think eventually a better answer would have to be
produced, one that justified the censorship. We're back to what
originally struck me as odd, and wrong, about this item. Whoever has her
stuff should copy it and move the copy offshore because something is
very wrong on the part of the court.

Oh pointy one,
I suppose you feel the same way about discussions of law as I feel about
discussions of physics. I think if we studied the archives  we'd find
that my physics is pretty well on target. I try to stay out of it but
sometimes I just can't help myself. It's not necessarily a bad thing.
When I said IANAL I did not offer legal advice - I only offered what I
think is right. Maybe that's what IANAL means. Shake loose a little of
your own earfudge and try reading it that way.
Right and wrong are not strictly the same as what is legal and what is
not. That imperfect alignment is the topic of many of the discussions on
this list. It may be idealistic and out of line with reality but no more
so than is the idea that the law defines right and wrong, is absolute
and in control. Besides, without a little idealism we'd all be eating
the King's shit three times a day and telling ourselves it's delicious.
SO, thanks bunches for your time. When I need legal advice I'll
certainly hire a lawyer and not someone who prefaces his statements with
IANAL. When I want to discuss opinions of what is right and what is
wrong I already know enough to take what a lawyer says cum grano salis.

@_subject: Spoliation, escrows, courts etc. 
I think there are several actions and states mixed up here and it makes
it difficult to extract the most pertinent opinions. I'm as guilty as
anyone of mixing the stuff together. I'll try to be more specific this
time. Let's start with the type of information the TX reporter might have. This information might be divisible into four classes : A) documents freely given by their owners
B) documents of dubious provenance
C) documentary works
D) editorial works
For information let's stick with C) and D). No real need to muddy the
waters. The sense of outrage is most keen when it comes to works created
by the reporter.
There are a fairly small set of states to be accounted for :
1) unaware that the information could become the object of a court
2) aware that the information could become the object of a court action
3) aware that the information was in fact the object of a court action
Now my sense of right and wrong says states 1) and 2) are equivalent and
that only state 3), awareness of a subpoena, is potentially relevant but
our relevant pro bono guy says not.
There are a few actions that are of interest
i)   disclosure
ii)  destruction
iii) revocable storage of copies
iv)  public distribution of copies
v)   irrevocable storage of copies
Whether it was clear or not, and despite it's being a frequent topic, I
don't think anyone was all that interested in the destruction of
evidence or the withholding of information, so that leaves iii), iv) and
v). Another frequent element of discussions here is the ease and
accuracy with which digital information can be copied and distributed
but I think most would agree that iii) is not interesting legally or
technically since like i) and ii) it comes down to can you conceal
information or not - a plain old ordinary fight. We're really left with three states :
  Perception and awareness of the court's degree of interest
    none, potential, forceful
and two actions :
  irrevocable storage of a copy as public or private
that are interesting. Narrowed down in this way my sense of right and wrong says the author of
the information can do as they choose and should not have to rely on
officially approved excuses to avoid incarceration. I feel this way
pretty much across the board for all types of works but for the moment
let's stick with non-software items such as a reporter is likely to
author. It seems as though, in the interest of justice, a court should
not have the power to confiscate or suppress an author's own work.
Examine it prior to publication? Possibly, but seriously debatable.
Aren't there any limits or controls on the actions of the court with
respect to an author? Aren't there some things that a court is simply
not allowed to do and will never even attempt? Is the only recourse in
the case of genuine abuse a long expensive losing battle against the
forces of darkness? To allow a court to punish the publication or
distribution of one's own works, even under subpoena, seems like an open
invitation to abuse. Oddly, thinking about this topic has made me remember some interesting
discussions with the person responsible for forcibly shutting down the
radio stations, television stations and newspapers as part of a (
successful and longstanding ) coup. It's a bit scary. I don't think the
power to destory^H^H^Hroy the press should be a fundamental part of the
structure here. Maybe we accept the actions of a police state more
peacefully when they're neatly clothed in formalities and done by baby
steps but that doesn't alter their underlying nature. As with a coup,
let's require full-blown military intervention to shut down the press.
At least then we'll have no doubts about where we stand. BTW - it will be interesting to actually find out detailed facts in the
case of this TX reporter. I'm sure Jim will graciously forward a link.

As for the "civil libertarian/anarcho-capitalist challenge" the poor in

their children and don't have the energy or the will to think about
political philosophy and realization through technology. That is the

I think when writing a Master Boot Record ( it's been 10 years since I
wrote tools that did this ) you can leave as much space as you want
completely uncomitted anywhere on the drive. This space should still be
accessible by logical block address on the device. What could get fairly
interesting is that drives typically reserve some sectors on each track
for replacement use should one of the logical sectors on the track go
bad. Western Digital  offers utilities that manage
their drives, apparently even the recent models. What I wonder is are
the proprietary APIs published or would the tools have to be reverse
engineered? This would allow access to substantial storage that would
not show up using that standard ATA calls. In the end though, that storage must be accessed from code in the BIOS
or the booted OS so wiping those will probably do the job. Seems like whether you're talking about asset recovery or Napster and
copyright the only solutions are men with briefcases and guns or

I have my own gripe about this and related items. We've all read about
MS's nasty license agreements and how they affect the spread of
alternative operating systems. Well, I wanted to pick a decent graphics
card that would be well supported under Linux. ATI has a lot of hooplah
on their site about how they are Linux-friendly so I started there. The
card I tentatively chose was the All-in-Wonder Radeon. It has MPEG2 HW,
TV Tuner, Graphics engine, TV out. There is XFREE86 support and there is
a project that has video capture working but no matter where I looked I
couldn't find technical docs for the thing. Isn't that where most driver
projects begin? It's what I've always stared with anyway. So I called
their Developer Support number and was told, in spite of the talk about
Linux support on the website, that they don't give that technical
reference out to just anyone but that some information had been released
to the Linux community. I have yet to locate exactly what was released.
I know it does not include the register set description for the TVout
portion and having seen SW DCT code in project sources I wonder if the
HW is being put fully to use. A HW DCT makes a huge difference in
performance. The net effect is that Linux development is hobbled. Is
this because ATI is protecting some sort of IP?
Anyway it kind of ticks me off.
So there's more, I'm pretty suspicious of BIOS and MS OS snoopiness.
Wouldn't it be nice to have open source BIOS? There is a Sourceforge
project called FreeBIOS and a cousin called LinuxBIOS. Again, I like to
start with documentation. Well the motherboard mfr offers little in the
way of technical info. Same for the chipset mfr. Unless you're a

Abraham Lincoln :
"Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Government, they can
exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their
revolutionary right to dismember or
overthrow it." President Abraham Lincoln, "First Inaugural Address" (available at
 "Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the
right to rise up, and shake off the existing government, and form a new
one that suits them
better. This is a most valuable,---a most sacred right---a right, which
we hope and believe, is to liberate the world. Nor is this right
confined to cases in which the
whole people of an existing government, may choose to exercise it." (Speech in the United States House of Representatives, Jan. 12, 1848) As far as I am concerned, to the extent that a government restricts
speech against it, it betrays its weakness and strengthens the
oppostion. When was the last time we heard one of our current crop of

Yup. Maybe a bootFLASH can be replaced with some SRAM which must be

lost short of extreme detection measures that is ). The little gizmo
reads the encrypted BIOS, decrypts and transfers it to boot SRAM.

convince Muslims everywhere to side with them and fight the infidels.
The US is trying to convince people we are not at war with an entire
religion. For the moment this seems to be true. So far the US has
managed to get some level of assent from the world community and
minimize the spread of unrest. Granted those nuclear weapons are
probably always accessible but why would the US use them now and
guarantee failure? It doesn't make sense. In short, why rush failure? It's already likely enough. There will be

If you're running an open source OS on one of the machines under test

Alternatively, you could probably just add a 3rd party to the setup and

that one driver could drive the two receivers. Just timestamp what you

Could this be applied to software development? I suppose that depends on
whether the software in design is prohibited or not. Until the DMCA is
altered or deleted there's already a class of SW that is illegal. It
doesn't seem so far-fetched that a discussion of content piracy followed
by an active coding project could be attacked. Why not a discussion of
tax evasion methods followed by a development project? And don't forget
that it's still possible to run afoul of the crypto export regulations.
Are our visionary legislators capable of outlawing new classes of
software? It's a sure bet. I'll leave it to the lawyers to argue over
how specific the speech and actions need to be.
Want to test it? Start a project with the stated goals of providing a
neat open source project with the stated purpose of cracking and
exchanging e-books and start posting code. If you were to start YAPPFSP
( yet another peer to peer file sharing project ) would you state its
purpose as "to share pirated music data?"
I'm sure there are plenty of conspiracy cases involving the more blatant
crimes like kidnapping etc...
Are there any militia cases? Like you said, try and find one. The law as
written does seem to outlaw speech. The anti-militia laws are
interesting in that the least popular are likely to suffer first from
"creative" legislation. If an approach is successful against the
unpopular then it can always be expanded to include new groups. I offer
the bomz and drug speech legislation as further attempts along the same
lines. Successful, no, not yet, but they'll keep trying.

@_subject: The Liberty Dollar 
The value of the Liberty Dollars is determined by both their
denominations and by their "bases". For instance, a $10 LIberty bill
with a "$10 base" also printed on it could be redeemed for 1 oz. of silver.
A $10 Liberty bill with with a "$20 base" printed on it
could be redeemed for 1/2 oz. of silver.  A $20 Liberty bill with a "$20
base" printed on it could be redeemed for 1 oz. of silver.
   Now, if you bought a $10 Liberty bill with "base 10" on it and NORFED
then started using a $20 base - no problem - your $10
Liberty bill could still be redeemed for the 1 oz. of silver that you were
entitled to at the time you bought the bill. You are not left
"holding the bag".
   As explained in the NORFED text below, if you are a redemption center,
then you can get a price break by buying in volume. This
increases your profit. As far as your customers who buy Liberty Dollars from
you - officially you charge a set premium on these dollars
to customers, but I bet you don't have to. I think that you would be allowed
to give a price break to customers. This would cut your profits
but that might not bother you too much and maybe you are an ideologue. This
would also allow the Liberty Dollar "end buyers" to take a
minimum loss. If done well, all the Liberty Dollar buyers would take, at
most,  a small hit on the store of value function.
   Also, there  are other values of honest, non-fiat money.  For instance,
the Liberty Dollar is inflation RESISTANT.  That would protect us
in inflationary times.  We are so used to inflation that we think it goes on
indefintely. However, it looks to me like we are headed for a deflationary
depression. I think that in that case the Liberty Dollar would  almost
certainly  lose value against the $US, but
I think it  would give good general protection against deflation too. The
TRANSACTION function: I think this is where much of its
potential lies and this needs a lot of experimenting. GENERATION: The
Liberty Dollar is partially backed by silver and, therefore,
is NOT DEBT CREATED!  This is a very major value! Debt generated money dooms

Explain to me how a computer hacker is more dangerous than a drunk
driver on the freeway? A hacker who interrupts power could be said to
put hundreds or thousands of lives at risk but so could a drunk driver
who spends an hour on the freeway. One is parallel the other is more or
less serial, so what?
I guess rationality has little to do with what we're seeing : enabling
technologies scare totalitarians.

if you'll just leave your back door ajar. I could suggest some alternate
meanings for "empowered". Sorry for the imagery. Tools of empowerment
Clarke said the recommendations -- which currently number 77 but could
change before the official announcement -- will include
government-provided software and other tools to make them easier to
implement. He declined to say what the specific recommendations are. "It's designed to not just say (they) have a responsibility, but to
empower them by giving them the tools," Clarke said.

Quite clearly cash has got to go! I'm not sure how tough this would be
to sneak past the slumbering electorate. Pretty tough I expect. But the
usage level is certainly going down while the percentage of electronic
transactions is skyrocketing. We've even had concresscritters suggesting
that the transport of $10K !interstate! should be illegal. I think this
came up when the most recent international transport rule changes were
made. It's getting more wierd every week now. An adjustment in the other
direction will come along soon - I hope but doubt.

All except for "home" and "login" - the "key" ones, so to speak.

I guess bifurcation points and speciation seem very clear because of the aliasing problems in our sampling methods. The speciation exists but is prolly ( probably ) often fuzzier than we think. Almost everyone would say that an American Bison and a Scot's Highland are two different species but they can hybridize. Maybe we non-Biologists measure the distance between "species" inaccurately.
Choose your measure : population? power? innovation? environmental impact? rate of The US seems more vital by some measures. Less so by others. More dangerous to the species by others.  That is interesting.
Is the evolution towards a more efficient language an active or passive process? Is it driven by an internal inclination towards expansion, freeing up system resources as it were, or is it a coping mechanism for sensory overload?

I read a few Burgess novels as a teenager - A Clockwork Orange, The Eve of St. Venus, One Hand Clapping, The Wanting Seed and I don't remember them that way. I remember them reading smoothly and clearly without a great struggle. Probably time to revisit one or two just to double-check my old brain.
I know the experience -  in the southern US, in Scotland - it's all English. Really? People are probably creating language constantly like a software evolutionary experiment. Much of it probably dies out. What remains appears to be "speciation". Write much Forth lately?

Harmon Seaver That's about what I've seen.
There's probably an X10 module that would let your Linux box cycle the power on your modem/router/switch. try $50 : If you're not using a domain name then your script could publish your IP address on your home page ( in the clear or not as you choose ).

Yeah, but they're open to a "database attack" - collect all of them with
their replies. I don't think you can randomly generate riddles from a
theoretically huge space (comparable to generating one random number from a
128-bit space).
