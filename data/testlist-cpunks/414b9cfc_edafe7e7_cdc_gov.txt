No, verislime is not good enough for me, for ethical reasons, not
security reasons.
What's good enough for most businesses is anything that keeps customers
from seeing self-signed cert warnings.  Given the choice, I'd pick
geotrust over no-thawte or verislime.
The only reason they're in business is because of browser warnings.  It
has nothing to do with "physical security" offered by the CA, or threat
models, or anything of that sort.
For e-commerce, nobody needs high security.  Anyone using a
high-credit-limit account online without a liability limit in case of
account theft is a moron.
The old must give way to the new, falsehood must become exposed by truth,
and truth, though fought, always in the end prevails.  -- L. Ron Hubbard
