@_subject: DOS Script Programming Request 
To any interested party:
I need 3 simple DOS scripts to be writter or translated from a UNIX script to DOS. The scripts need to do the following:
1) Look into a specific directory and execute a .bat file that will sign encrypt the file(s) in the directory using Viacrypt's PGP and wipe out the original.  It then needs to move the cyphertext file(s) to a second directory.
2) The second script needs to log on to a netcom account, enter user id and password and upload the cyphertext files in the second directory using Z-modem transpher.  The netcom account is already programmed to mail the files to the correct address.  It then needs to logout and move the transfered files to a third directory.
3) The 3rd script needs to delete all files in the third directory that are over 15 days old on the 1st and 15th of each month.
The first two scripts need to run on a timer and in sequential order on a daily basis.  That's it.
If you are interested, let me know and I will fill you in on specific details. Also include a proposed charge for the programming.

@_subject: SCO Unix Crontab Problems-Need Help 
I have a bourne shell that I need to execute in SCO unix 4.0 from a crontab.  The script is a communications upload using ecu.  The script runs just fine in terminal mode, but when it is executed in cron, it is not able to gain access of the modem for some reason.  Q:  Is there something special that needs to be added to the crontab line in order to allow for tty access.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions.
