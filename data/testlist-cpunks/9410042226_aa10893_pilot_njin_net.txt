Depends on your definition of secure.  Since it is run on Julf's
personal computer, I'd say the hardware is secure from tampering.  But,
given that it does not support PGP, and has the potential to reveal
anonymous IDs when cross-posting, and has had problems with spoofed mail
etc, I would say it's not very sercure.
