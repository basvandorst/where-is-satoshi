@_subject: New rallying cry (was  Re: FOI- Arizona Stadium Tax Nazis) 
Thanks for posting. I've forwarded it and copied the board members,
as a courtesy:
I'm one of those who believes there may be something to the claims that Secretary Knox perjured himself when he told Congress that the 16th Amendment had been properly ratified.  I've recently come up with this eerily familiar rallying cry.
"No taxation without re-ratification".
