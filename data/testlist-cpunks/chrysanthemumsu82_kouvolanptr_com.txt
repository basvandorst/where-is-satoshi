we are happily enjoying being able to play outside again. i love the comments i get from all of you. where you can get great steak and shrimp
i love the color palette and obvious softness. haha, that's my girl. when you need to be home, may you find your way.
she's amazing. and it's so yummy
i am excited about my new running shoes.
really really happy.
she'll be here friday and saturday april 3rd and 4th, and she'll be taking appointments for all day/ night both days at my house. and you are happy.
i am not going to worry...about a thing.
i love her style. and my wheels are turning with projects to put together for a locals knitting class. i always enjoy knitting lacy stuff but this pattern was especially fun, super easy, and portable.
and i love it (thanks, coco). i recommend rounding your troops for a similar conversation, and a brainstorm session for how to prepare for what lies ahead. just sayin.
my happy plans for this evening include knitting and watching two favorite movies: far and away followed by tristan and isolde.
but then again, we looove roadtrips.
