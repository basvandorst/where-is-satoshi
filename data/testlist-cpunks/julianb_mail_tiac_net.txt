@_subject: Netscape download requirements 
What exactly is the reason for Netscape asking for the name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number of anyone who wishes to download the US-browser? If I remember correctly MIT in distributing PGP only asks that you affirmatively assent to obeying export laws (and the terms of the rsa license).
I have not heard at any point that the MIT system does not meet the legal requirements of ITAR. Is there perhaps some other reason Netscape wishes to have this information? --Julian Burke
