Nah!! It's Compu$erve bouncing mail because the mail-box is probably full.
I can very easily imagine the net totally flooding it!! :-)

@_subject: ANON: Sysadmin Policies at Universities (and HS) 
Hmmm.. Unless you guys in the states get third level education for free you've *already* plunked down some $$$ as course fees. I would assume that a portion of the fees for an IT related course would be applied to purchase/upkeep of the
relevant kit.
IMHO the attitude of educational establishments which can border on the paranoid whenever they come across usage of "their" systems which isn't typical
is very similar to the classic model of the commercial DP gruppenfuhrer... Both
can be regarded as empire-builders..

@_subject: Unacceptable slander by dclunie 
Forgive me if I appear slow over this but I don't see any problem with Davids Mailbombing a mailing list like cypherpunks with 80K of dross is not acceptable
behaviour (whether it was through ignorance or malice) and in those circumstances contacting the site postmaster seems a reasonable thing to do.
I do agree with another post who suggested that the admin side of the list does
need to be tightened up so that future incidents like this do not occur. However we are in danger of blowing this up out of all proportion.

[shortened even more]
Think about this scenario for a moment: dclunie sends mail to the system
adiministrator of an institution complaining of the mail sent by a
particular user. The system administrator confronts the user, who then
explains the situation. He explains that he has sent numerous requests to
be unsubscribed from the list, but they continue to send large volumes of
mail. Out of frustration, he sends an 80K file to the list hoping it will
get someone's attention. The mail continues, and several members of the
list makes threats of "dirty tricks" and "mail bombs" against him. Now one
of the "cypherpunks" is sending libelous mail to the system administrator.
The system administrator now understands the situation; an educational
institution on the net is made aware of a rapidly developing campaign of
harrassment and vandalism by the cypherpunks. So what happens now? Are the
cypherpunks winning?
Are you people blind to what you are doing? What fools!!!
