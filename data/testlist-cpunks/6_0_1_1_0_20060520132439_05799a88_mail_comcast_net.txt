I think this is entirely too clever, and while I don't agree with
sneak-and-peak warrants in general, as long as they exist, these
countermeasures clearly violate the non-disclosure terms.
A "warrant canary" does in fact disclose sneak-and-peak warrant service.
Anyone arguing otherwise must rely on some limited, naive definition of
"disclose."  Not even Webster's, the clearinghouse of shallow and narrow
definitions, defines "disclose" as "communicate something to something
through positive action."
Does anyone have a link to a sample sneak-and-peak warrant no-disclosure
