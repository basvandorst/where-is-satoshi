@_subject: Disinformation 
I'm new to this list, but not to the issues discussed.
As far as "the ends justifying the means" - jeez, have'nt we all learned *anything* yet? I spent 4 years in the Israeli army witnessing all manner of atrocities commited (on both sides) in the name of lofty, noble goals.
The first victim of oppression is always the truth - lets not play into their hands. If our anti-Crapper-Chip case is strong enough on it's merits (and we all obviously believe it is), then we only weaken ourselves by resorting to disinformation. "They" will always lie more artfully than we can - it's how they got elected in the first place. it's what they do for a living. Have a little more faith in the truth, don't sell out.

@_subject: VIRTUAL meeting needed 
What about MediaMOO
(MIT MediaLab)
Storm the temple!
I'll be happy to talk with the janitors to ensure they can handle all the guest accounts simultaneously and set up a suitable environment
(there is a virtual auditorium which is set-up to handle a large gathering and there is precedent for this type of meeting).
Can anyone give me an idea of how many people were on for the last meeting?
