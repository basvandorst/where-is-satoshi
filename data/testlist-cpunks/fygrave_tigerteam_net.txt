Wrong. Having russian background I guess I have more clear understanding
what these guys are trying to say: The government is definetely
ineffective in protecting its citizen, providing the social wealthfare
to them and such, but on the other hand the government corruption, deep
involvement with crimilal circles and udertable deals with big foreign
corporations bring the country into the situation when the rulling top
of the country is having/sharing a huge amount (can't bring any number) of
all the profits, while the rest of population (especially pensioners in
russia (people of age of 50 and above, who are brought up in
post-socialist environment and are totally incapable to adopt to new
environment)) are thrown and maintained in poverty.
not all are vodka drinking idiots. but your statement makes sense. :-)
What's worse, is that it's been observed in some country side areas,
when one guy is managing to do good on his land, the others get jealous
or something, and his house could get burnt eventually with no reason..
happened a few times a few years ago.
Come on. Keep in mind that this statement was written by 'a party of
pensioners'. Which means by people in age of 50 and above with strong
socialist background. They are trying to find a solution to the problem,
the only problem here, is that they still apply old patterns to it.
Union? Which Union? I doubt russia is welcomed to European Union (update
me if I am wrong) and there's no former Soviet Union either. More over
the Union of Idependent Countries, seems to be getting gone piece by
piece, at least now you need to proper visa if you want to visit Russia
from one of the 'former' republics.
Quality is usually good. ;-) (you can use a pocket radio to hitch nails
f.e. ;-)) Design is scarey, but that's a postsequence of post-socialism
way of working. Noone cares if something looks good as long as it is
practical ;-)
[snip snip]
whatever.. hope my comments are helpful ;-)

The difference is: those people are incompetent in performing the roles
which they were elected for (i.g. being governors of country's wealth,
building laws and rules in the country to assist economy development and
such), but those people are very *competent* in ripping the other people
off. That is the primary reason why they went for the game to be elected
in government and that's the primary reason why they got power to do so.
Indeed. "Don't give power to those who desire it. Those who do, desire
it for their own profits".
What is ex-satellite? ;-)
I doubt that a significant number is either. There could be certain
percentage that is higher than in other countries, which might be the
reason of such image of a nation to exist.
:-) Well, hard to say which 'real version' of capitalism is good. I would
strongly vote against american model for sure, which turns people and
people's relationships into mostly money-based relations. IMHO
relationships in eastern europe and asia are more human and less money
dependent than in US pretty much because of such reason.
It was a good thing (tm). That's what european union is coming too.
Easier econimics relationship between parts of the union. Easier
traveling. Centralised model of control of such union is a bit flawed
though, but definetely is better than heaps of small countries with its
own barriers.
