Hash: SHA1
Now that Lavabit is off, we should seek another server with encryption.
My question are, there are another encrypted email service like Lavabit?
Or we have to create a new encrypted email service?

It seems that a lot of RAM are required.

I think that the Goverment don't need to ask for a Backdoor in Linux.
The goverment can ask Intel for a Backdoor in the hardware.

If the wolf are eating sheeps, we need to fight against the wolf and
help the sheeps. We need better encryption and anonymity to speak with
freedom and fight against the ignorance and lies. The point is, how we
can create new and better algorithms to protect the human rights?? A
society of sheep don't deserve a government of wolves.

 To difficult the espionage and try to improve anonymity. Without open
and transparent organisms (ISP, governments, etc) real privacy and
anonymity is impossible.

Our idea is not to build a perfect program, is to build a program to
accomplish one goal and improve it as we learn more (in deep
cryptography we are newbies) to do it more useful (and publish it when /
if we get to a reasonable level), but the first step is to present the
idea to be criticized I think. We will learn more about cryptography and
alternative nets (like DC nets), thank to all.

I want to present an idea to improve anonymity and privacy on the
intrernet that me and my companion are building.
How it works: To improve anonymity, the diferent hosts are connected
with groups of multiple hosts that comunicate each other spoofing the
source ip and broadcasting the messages that have to be sent to some
host. With this method the reciever don't know who want to download X
file and if the NSA or FBI get the logs of the reciever they can not use
it for trace the origin. The sender don't know who have X file because
they have sent a broadcast request for download a file and will recieve
the file with spoofed ip, is 99% anonnymous, the only problem is that the ISP can always know if you are using this program.
For the cryptography we use SHA-3 (keccak) for hashing, AES, ECDSA and
the better algorithms and methods that we know (we are only amateur
With cryptography is easy to protect data against the ISP MitM but it's
more dificult to send private messages to a single person. For this
reason the topology for the network is of isolated groups with their own
private key for the members, obviously a group can be public. Of course
a group of 2 people is useless because there are not anonymity xD Bigger
groups, more entropy, more anonimity.
For the "POC" we are using UDP. UDP only can send small packets of
~64kb, therefore, it can be used for a chat but is too slow to download
big files. We have sacrified speed to increase anonymity and privacity.
We have "tested" it in a small group of people and for this reason we
can not say if it works or not, but in theory it works!
And that is the idea :) , what do you think?
PD:Sorry for my english :P

   In the Onion network if the first node is fake, they can get your
real ip and catch you, in our network all the source ips are fake
(spoofed ips), therefore, if they read the logs they don't know who are
you really.
onion nets obfuscate your ip with proxy, our project delete your real ip
and put a one fake. For this reason all communications are with groups
and broadcastings.

We know that the sources ips generally are dropped, this is the only
problem that we have.
But if multiple hosts can use the same ip how the connection can be
traced? Only the ISP have the information, the receiver don't know
anything a part from the content of the packet.

We know that ISP have the 100% of information, but the idea was to give
less information to the receiver. Even yet I couldn't find any
transparent ISP, seems that all ISPs are trolls xD, maybe pirateISP are
more transparent¿?...
