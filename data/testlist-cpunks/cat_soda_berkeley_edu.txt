@_subject: keywords 
yes, my remailer does insert keywords, and you can expect that i will
continue refinining the keyword insertion system so that it will be harder
to automatically filter out.
some people have said that keywords should be an option, not a default.  i
rejected this idea, because keywords are useless unless they are widely
there is safety in large numbers.
from the cypherpunk perspective, ideally, all or most net communications
would consist of encrypted text, with the only plaintext being keywords, i
if the keywords really do bother you, you can use some other remailer.
also, if you have good keywords lists, please send them to me.  i might have
missed something.

@_subject: what gtoal wrote about something 
somebody (was it gtoal?) said something yesterday about how you could have
the remailer encrypt the address of the person sending it and put that
encrypted address in a block at the end of the message.  this would be a
good way to do it because the remailer operator cannot reveal a database of
aliases and also not having a database makes the remailer easier to maitain
and operate, resulting in a remailer with response capabilities, and yet as
easy to use as the traditional cypherpunks remailer.
i thought that was a cool idea, so i implemented that on the soda remailer
(remailer at soda.berkeley.edu).  give it a shot.  just use it as you normally
would and you will see how the response feature works.  or finger
remailer at soda or send mail to remailer at soda with Subject: remailer-info.

@_subject: rng, anyone? 
i'm doing some stuff on this remailer which requires a good rng.
perl's rng just calls c's rng, which totally sucks.  does
anyone know of a cryptographically sound rng i can use?  i could
just call it from perl or something.

@_subject: how do i do this with pgp? 
i'm writing a lot of perl scripts that need to interact with pgp.
however, i have not found an easy way of getting a passphrase to pgp
from a script.  i realize of course that this is for security; pgp
only wants things typed in from a keyboard.  however, there are plenty
of times when automated processing is desired, and security of the key
does not need to be perfect.  in these cases, the only way (it seems to
me) to get pgp to work is to setenv PGPPASS, which is really terrible
security.  is there a better way to do this?  will there be some
easier way in future versions of pgp, like being able to read
the passphrase from stdin?

@_subject: remailer@soda 
remailer at soda (formerly hh at soda) now uses pgp's implementatoin
of idea for the encrypted response block function, making it
much more secure (i hope).
the code will soon be released.
