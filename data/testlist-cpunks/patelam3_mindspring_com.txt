Maybe the "wiretap" hooks in the carriers' systems are accessable
more globally than they would wish us to believe.

@_subject: When did Mondex ever claim to be anonymous? 
You have claimed many flaws with the Modex system and there are even more
you have not mentioned.  I won't go into that here, except one.  When the
hardward fails how do you purchase, enter, or exercise your rights of
purchase or entry?  Privacy, there is none with a system like the Modex.  A
trial was held in Atlanta during the Olympics and it was a total disaster.
The system worked half the time.  People had money they could not spend.
But, believe me the system is coming and the world doesn't need another
avenue of access to personal data and private issues.  Bring on the
encryption and encrypt every thing.

@_subject: Montgolfiering, the Hot Air Balloon of Cryptography 
To nobody at replay.com (Anonymous):
I will use simple words so you can understand.
My IQ is not 207 but I know BS when I see it.  Too much bravado without
substance.  Too much hot air without mass.  You claim that thermodynamics is
about hot air.  Anyone with a basic course in physics knows that
thermodynamics is not just about hot air.
Present the algorithm and it's proof if you want someone to listen or stop
wasting everyones time with your rantings.
