I think Tim was referring to someone gleaning your private key, which would be a Disastrous Thing (tm). If that's not what he was referring to, I still think it's a possiblity.

     I gather that it would be a Bad Thing (TM) to have someone get both      the encrypted and clear text forms of your message (from either you or      from the recipient)
     Maybe regularly changing your encryption keys is a Good Thing (TM)
