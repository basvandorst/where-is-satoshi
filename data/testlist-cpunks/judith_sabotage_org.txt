@_subject: french cypherpunks 
Hi there,
Are there any french cypherpunks or french
speaking canadian cypherpunks on this list ?
I have to discuss privacy on the net in french.
To read some articles on this subject would be very helpfull
to learn to use the right type of jargon: the dutch-french dictionary does not handle jargon of any type. Btw: did anybody scan their photo's of the HIP '97 (in this case
near the cypherpunkerstent-site) yet?
I couldn't find any.
best regards,
