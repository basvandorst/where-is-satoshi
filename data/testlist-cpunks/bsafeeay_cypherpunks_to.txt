BSAFEeay alpha 1 is now available! BSAFEeay, also known as BSAFE International, is a public domain implementation of the BSAFE API, implemented outside the US and based on public domain source code which uses BSAFE, such as SETref.
BSAFEeay currently implements enough of the BSAFE API to support
SETref, with more support coming soon. Combined with SETref, BSAFEeay
enables the first entirely public domain SET implementation.

        BSAFEeay is NOT a product of RSA Data Security, Inc. and you still
must license RSA in the US.
