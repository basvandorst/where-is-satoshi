@_subject: PICS is not censorship 
I do not believe that PICS is a form of censorship, except for those people - children and employees - whose computing environment is beyone their direct control and who have to live with a browser that filters based on PICS labels.
For much, much more on the Internet content regulation debate, see my WWW site.
PICS is basically an excellent idea in my view.  It provides a means of child protection which is not censorship of the net or censorship of sources of information.  It is also useful for other things.  However I don't beleive it is practical or desirable to insist that
all people use PICS and a particular value system to label their WWW
material - there is likely to be no suitable value system which is
adequate in all situations.

@_subject: OECD policy: constructive comments? 
The US, French and UK government policies on crypto control are The OECD has a group of so-called experts who are likely to reach the same conclusion about how governements "must" have access to the content of criminal communications.
For a commented version of a leaked draft the OECD crypto guidelines, see my WWW site.  Recently I got some email from someone at the OECD who is on the secretariat working on this.  The didn't seem to mind me publishing the draft and they seemed to appreciate my comments.
These people seem to be in their own government circle - but if you can get through to them, at least some of them will listen.  They are likely to be intelligent, concerned people, but due to their lack of wide perspective (something they really should be working harder on, for sure) they may come up with some totally unrealistic policies.
In fact, most of the draft seems to be really good - it is only the last bit on law-enforcement access which is crook and this seems to be at odds with the rest of the draft.
It is no good complaining about them sitting in their bunker if we won't crawl out of ours.  If you have some constructive comments on the draft, let me know and I will put you in touch with the OECD secretariat.  - Robin

@_subject: PICS is not censorship 
I agree to a certain extent with Timothy May about the potential for
content labelling of Internet resources being made compulsory in the
US.  The country seems at times to be run be run by nutcases and
their elected representatives. There are huge swings in fashion
regarding prohibition, liberty etc.
To the extent that this is a risk, lets hope it is only an American
problem.  I understand that the Australian Broadcasting Authority
 does not recommend compulsory
This may be seen to imply that PICS is a ratings service or a single set of values.  It is not. PICS is a protocol for labelling things, either within themselves or labelling them remotely.  There can be any number of value systems for labelling things.  See my site for links to the PICS site and some discussion.
However, talk of "compulsory PICS" really must mean that all content be labelled with a PICS protocol label (presumably inside the resource itself) according to _at_least_one_ globally or nationally mandated value system.  Even with a descriptive rather than an evaluative value system (see ABA Chairman's recent speech at above link) I think it would take years to come up with a descriptive value system which would be generally useful for filtering material according to child protection, cultural specific issues (like Singapore banning horse race tipping and astrology) and protecting adults/employees from violence, erotica, gambling etc. etc.
Then the value system would be impossibly complex. Then, how would you decide whether something was properly labelled.  This is probably off topic for Cypherpunks (if that is indeed possible) so I won't say any more.

@_subject: OECD crypto policy draft guidelines 
There is an ad-hoc group of government representatives (called an
"expert group" actually) working on an OECD set of cryptography policy
They have a big five day meeting coming up starting 12 December in
A September draft of their guidelines was leaked and put on a WWW site in Austria:     as a Word 6 file.
I got it, turned it into HTML and put it on my site with comments.
   Recently, someone from the OECD crypto secretariat emailed me indicating they had read my comments and found them reasonably I have since added more comments, which I emailed to the secretariate
person.  If anyone has something constructive to convey to them, email
me and I will put you in touch with them.
I understand there will be an article on the debate in the next weekly edition of The European newspaper.
The people at Quintessenz apparently have a later draft which they are
scanning and will put up on their site ASAP.

@_subject: OECD crypto policy draft guidelines 
What is this list about?? Religion, the semantics of reality vs.
perception or doing something constructive about crypto policy???
The latest draft of the OECD guidelines are now at my WWW site.      Check them out - especially para 59.  All the bad bits have been relegated to debateable things in square brackets.
Get your mind into this and get your comments to Marc Rotenberg - who I understand is involved with the OECD crew.
So much for "PICS is not censorship" being off topic for this list!

@_subject: Draft OECD crypto guidelines on WWW 
I have obtained the OECD draft crypto guidelines from:
   where they are a Word 6 file.  I have converted them to HTML and put
them at:
   This is probably not the absolute latest draft, but it is the best I
can get.
I think there is a lot of good material here, but they still seem
wedded to the idea of key-recovery or some other means of governments
accessing plaintext or keys.  They seem to assume there will always be
a copy of the key around the place somewhere.  In general, in the
future cryptographic exchanges will use fresh key-pairs for each
session, so not even the user can get a copy of the private key. Maybe
key-recovery techniques are designed to cope with this, but the
question is why would anyone want to use such a system other than that
the government (and some corporations aligned with the government)
want them to?
There is no reason why ordinary or criminal users should be
interested in key recovery/escrow, or weakened key-spaces - what they
need is simple to use, totally secure, end-to-end encryption.  The
whole aim is to make a bulletproof secure pipe that doesn't depend on
any other data, technology or administrative actions.
The draft guidelines have my comments at the start, including a
suggested rewording of paragraph 88 which currently states that
crypto systems *should* provide for lawful access to the
plaintext/key.  The OECD people do not seem to have considered the fact that
criminals will wrap their material in a crypto system they can trust
before putting it through the government mandated system that they
don't trust. My comments include a more detailed discussion of this
argument, particularly in the situation where criminals are
communicating with non-criminals.     In a nutshell, how is all the cost, risk, doubt and    complication of key escrow/recovery etc. justified by its    benefits for serious crime prevention/deterrence, when the    great majority of criminals and a large number of ordinary    private and commercial users will be applying their own    strong encryption first?
Does anyone know of writing that specifically tackles this question?
This is a separate question from those about whether governments can
be trusted, or about absolute rights to privacy etc.  It is simply a
cost/benefit analysis.  To me the benefits for reducing serious crime
seem slim indeed and the costs - not least the general feeling that
people may be using daily a system specifically designed for tapping
their communications - seem to be very high.

@_subject: Dorthy Denning is a boot-licking fasicist!!! 
Spelling please!  "Dorothy".  She is a US academic.
It may be emotionally satisfying to rail against (what for us may be
evident as) the wickedness and stupidity of our opponents.
I did not see the testimony, so I can't comment on it.
However I believe that Dorothy Denning is motivated as much as many of
us by the desire for a healthy society.  The sharp difference in
crypto policy can probably be explained by a differing understanding
1 - The likely behaviour of professional criminals, normal people,
    government officials and criminal government officials in the
    future with various forms of crypto system.
2 - Different levels of trust and fear regarding crime in general,
    big-time crime in particular and the use and abuse of law     enforcement and other government powers.
3 - Probably other things too.
I think that there are different personality types at work here. Adding to that is the tendency for governments to employ people who
generally trust governments, their desire to perpetuate their former
abilities to detect and deter crime and especially the problem of
Groupthink is the tendency for like minded individuals to reject
uncomfortable notions, and so develop a seriously inadequate
understanding of reality.
JFK admitted they were stupid to commence the Bay of Pigs invasion. Clinton will probably say the same thing about crypto export controls.
There is clear evidence that, being surrounded by like minded advisers, both presidents were the victims of groupthink.
If we nod our heads to "Dorthy Denning is a boot-licking fasicist!!!"
then we too are succumbing to groupthink.
   for Dorothy Denning's response to my challenge for justifying costs of
key-escrow/recovery against the likely benefit in crime reduction. I
don't think it is a very strong response, and while many on this list
will know more about her than I do, her response does not strike me as
the work of someone who is unintelligent, uninterested in the future
of society or a fascist.
The net result of various misunderstandings (such as Clinton and Co.
must have about the freely available nature of strong crypto) may well
be stupidity on a grand scale.
There are personality types who lean away from privacy and towards
dangerous levels of government control.  I think this can be amplified
by the circumstances in which these people work - and groupthink is a
big part of that.  oecd_dr.htm is a recent draft of some OECD crypto work, with my
comments, especially concerning the likely behaviour of criminals
communicating both with other criminals and with non-criminals.  It
also has some information on an essay by Irving L. Janis called "Group
Think" which I recommend to everyone who is involved in policy
