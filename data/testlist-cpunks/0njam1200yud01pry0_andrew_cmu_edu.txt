@_subject: A Rumor and Reputation Paradox... 
Re: Rumor's regarding Tommy Hilfinger's remakrs, I'm not sure it's as
simple as he said/he didn't say. True, he didn't spurt racism on
Oprah, however, has some quotes that indicate that he might very well have made
comments derisive to black culture if he *had been on Oprah. Mayhaps
the reason that the rumors are so persistant is that they are so
plausible. In that case, maybe they shouldn't been seen so much as a
failure of the reputation economy...
Qoutes from Tommy Hil:
"Many of these people would rather have a Rolex than a home"
"I don't condone violence, and I think 'gangsta rap' should be
 outlawed, but the music is powerful because the musicians are
 irreverent and don't follow the rules. I don't tell them where to  make their money, and I don't tell them where to spend their money."
Tommy Hil and other "street" fashion designers are about exploitation.
There is no respect or community there. I suspect the rumors' success
in bsed on that. They are false, but they represent truthful
