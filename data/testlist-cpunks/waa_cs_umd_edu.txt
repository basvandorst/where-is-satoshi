You may want to look at EAP-PAX. We tried to engineer around the  patent land mines in the field when we designed it. This of course  doesn't mean that someone won't claim it infringes on something.
We also have a proof (not yet published) of security in a random  oracle model.
Best, Bill
p.s. EAP-PAX is work with my student T. Charles Clancy.
