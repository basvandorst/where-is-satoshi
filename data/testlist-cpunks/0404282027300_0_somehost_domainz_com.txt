Presidents don't pass laws.  Presidential campaigns would be reduced to
issues that are mutable (vulnerable?) to executive orders.
Individual candidates for federal office can't pass laws either.  You
want to hold a Senator liable when his compatriots (even if they form
the majority) don't support everything your senator supports?
Nobody who understands the basics of U.S. government construction could
possibly believe that a candidate's "promise" is a guarantee.  It is
merely a statement of ideology.
What then, consequences for not "attempting" to effect promises?  Who's
to judge?
