@_subject: Anonymous vs false IDs 
There is a lot of effort being put into creating tools to mask identities.
I'm curious why people don't go a different route - creating a false
electronic identity? If you have control over your own system, it is easy
enough to create an account. Lacking that, there are a lot of companies
out there offering low cost accounts on Unix systems with full Internet
access. Why not get an account in a different name rather than using
anonymous remailers?
  I can see some reasons for going both routes, I'm just curious as to
other people's reasons.

@_subject: tapping hardware? (was re: Mark Abene (Phiber Optik) sentenced) 
I'd just copy everything to tape as I'd been doing for years. You don't
need anything new to tap the phone line to pick up the data. After that,
you just need to figure out the baud rate, parity, and data compression
(which could be done by trial and error pretty quickly) and then just
play the tape into a modem that was set up correctly.   Unless I'm missing something, it seems pretty simple.

@_subject: Against limiting free speech on public networks 
Worse, you can't convince anyone new to the list that you're not
just a group of children with large egos and complex privacy enhancing
toys. I've seen a few well written messages in this group and some
pointers to interesting information, but by far the most volume on
this list, and the xtropians list for that matter, has been petty
bickering. I had higher hopes ....

@_subject: Duress Passwords/PINs/Combinations 
The SecureID system has a duress PIN built in to it as well. Using
that PIN, you're still authenticated, but the server software knows
that you entered it under duress and does the "appropriate" thing.

@_subject: Disruptive members 
This list is allowing itself to be disrupted. More effort is being
expended by its members complaining and commenting about LD than he
is expending. Ignore the guy and get on with life.
