Take your bigotry and fuck the hell off.
Shut up and code.

Sour apples ! Buckets of them that even the chickens wont eat.
.... but this is not about trans people. It's about the innocence or
guilt of a high profile person in the community that many of us have
come to love.
Keep the bigotry out of it.

Mirimir - trying to make it about being trans is why i went after you.
The reality of trans life is not immunity. It is generally
discrimination and needing to watch your 6 for someone who is after you
for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Wonder why i might want strong encryption and privacy ?

Are you aware that all mail in the US is scanned at central points and
subjected to a fairly high level of scrutiny. Anonymous mail is more
highly scrutinized.

As a former labor organizer i know that when you are under a microscope
every personal fault you have will be used against you. If you are a
minute late you will be legally fired. If you take too lake a break you
will be canned.
If you are a political organizer it will be your personal faults that
will be used against you - your excessed with booze or drugs or
inability to control impulses or in this case apparent intoxication with
power in relationships.
I very much enjoyed Jakes presentations but i can see how rock star
status can be too much for some. It's important to stay sober when you
are under the gun.
