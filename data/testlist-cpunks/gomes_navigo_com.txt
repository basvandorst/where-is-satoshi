You can feedback from the group actively running remailers at the following
I'm on the list as previous remail operator (remailer at tamsun.tamu.eud) and
more recently an adhoc remailer user.  You don't have to be an operator to
subscribe.  The list is low bandwidth but good for keeping on top of the
state of active remailers.

I found it a bit interesting that toad.com was used as an example source for
network probes detected by a network based IDS:

Hi Matt,
I've read into the Jornal do Brasil site and others (O Globo [1] and
Terra[2]) and don't see any mention of the new legislation.  I'll check w/
family in Brazil but if you get further word and could spread the word that
would be great.

I haven't heard anything like that around here. Ive searched JB and have found nothing to that respect. Furthermore, it seems a bit unBrazilian to take such a stance. Brazilian nationals do not have a Constitutional Right to bear arms ( not even for a well-regulated militia) and there has been a clear legislative movement towards restricting as much as possible the use / permission to use / purchase of firearms. Some time ago there was a bill introduced in the Brazilian Congress seeking to ban all civilian firearms, except for rural citizens rifles.
Even it the news was true, it would be the fastest ever action ever from Congress. The Brazilian Congress simply is not able to legislate that fast. The only way to introduce legislation with such urgency is by Provisional Measures, which is somewhat like an Executive Order. The President passes a Provisional Measure, which has the same efficacy of law during 60 days; during that period congress must confirm or deny the Measure. If confirmed, it is converted into law.

Walter Cronkite was on CBS Early Morning today and spoke about the need for
a "censorship" forum where representatives from the military, journalists,
historians, the private sector broadcasters, etc. would meet and review
information gotten from the front lines of the new conflict and control the
timelines for distribution of such information to ensure both national
security, security of troops, and preservation of history.   I've gotten an
email recently that he was speaking on the same topic on the west coast
yesterday.   I don't have much more information on this and welcome any
other input...
Cronkite is an advisor for MediaChannel.org which has the following section:
Here's a text from Walter Cronkite on Feb 3, 2000 which appears to counter
his recent advocacies:
I'm particularly excited about one aspect of the Media's Channel's work: its
encouragement to people inside the media to speak up-to speak out about
their own experiences. Corporate censorship is just as dangerous as
government censorship, you know, and self-censorship can be the most
insidious form of pulling punches. Pressures to go along, to get along, or
to place the needs of advertisers or companies above the public's need for
reliable information distort a free press and threaten democracy itself.
