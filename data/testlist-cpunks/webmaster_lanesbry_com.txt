@_subject: CDR: CDA - cypherpunks distributed archive 
We offer:
reformatted cypherpunks archives at  some time ago it was noted that the ftp links from the CDA
(cypherpunks archives 92-early 94) at
 were unreliable (at least
under lynx). ftp access via ftp://ftp.lanesbry.com/pub/cypherpunks
was confirmed as a workaround.
I've (belatedly?) changed this to use http file links. (and added
a robots.txt file to suggest that search engines not index the whole
text.) Please advise any problems with this update. [Links to this
archive should not need to change.]
