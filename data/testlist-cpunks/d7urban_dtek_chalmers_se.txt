@_subject: Different remailer software 
I've just taken a quick look at soda.berkeley.edu's remailers.
There's several of them, and if I'm now to install one of them,
what are their strengths/weaknesses? Should I choose hal's
remailer? Or maybe Nate's? Or hh-remailer? Sameer's anon-
remailer? The INDEX file doesn't say anything about what
differs one remailer from the next, just who wrote it...
Help me out, please!

Timothy C. May said something along the lines of:
What inappropriate use is that? Inhaling? And what could possibly
happen to me as a non-American? If some guys in black suits comes
looking for me, I would be very surprised. Perhaps not for long,
but never the less surprised...

@_subject: (fwd) What the IRS is up to 
If anyone is interested, this is how it is done here in Sweden today. Almost,
anyway. You get a single paper where you put an X in the square which
says 'The reports that I've got (from your employer, bank etc.) are
correct' and then you sign it at the bottom. That's it.
Is this what you are afraid of? It most probably *will* happen to you.
(There are ofcourse exceptions to this, if you have a business, or
have income from other sources etc.) The fact is, though, that the
majority of us do use this simplified tax return.
