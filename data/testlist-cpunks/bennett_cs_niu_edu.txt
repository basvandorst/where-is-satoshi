@_subject: The use of malicious botnets to disrupt The Onion Router 
On Sat, 2 Feb 2008 01:57:01 -0500 "Ron Wireman"      Actually, there are benefits, some of which are even pointed out in
various web pages and/or documents available at   One
is that running a server helps to hide your client's traffic by mixing it
in with all the traffic relayed for others.  Another is that each server's
presence increases the overall capacity for traffic going through the tor
network, thereby providing support for even bigger crowds of packets and
circuits for your own to be concealed among.
     The problem of corrupted exit servers is indeed one that we should all
ponder until a solution may be found.  However, setting up, say, 1,000 hidden,
slaved, correctly configured tor servers via a bot net may be rather more
difficult to accomplish than you have fully considered.  Entry guards and
middlemen probably wouldn't be useful to an attack coordinator.
     Again, I think you may well be underestimating the manpower required to
install and configure lare numbers of tor servers.

     I trust that, once you have figured out how to make it work properly,
you will generate new keys for your currently not-so-very-hidden service,
now that you've identified the connection between the URL above and yourself.
     For that matter, it's probably best *not* to run most kinds of hidden
services on tor relays precisely because tor relays are well known through
the directory.  Running a hidden service on a client-only tor would be the
safest way because clients are not listed anywhere as such.  There might be
a place for running a hidden service on a bridge, but it would have to be
for something not terribly dangerous to the hidden service operator because
bridges *are* known to the bridge authorities and thus must be considered to
be listed somewhere.  Something like a web service that is also accessible
directly and publicly and that presents no known danger to its operator (e.g.,
the various tor status pages) can reasonably be run on a tor relay node,
a bridge, or a client.
     Best you learn how to protect your butt *before* opening it up to the
world, no?  Have you thought about running your service inside a jail or a
virtual machine?  That would make it much easier to wall it off from the
rest of your computer and home network.
     Again, a jail or a VM would help you contain any damage, and a backup
of the jail's or VM's environment would make it very easy and fast to
restore it to the way you set it up.
     A jail or a VM can certainly help you there by limiting the ability
of shell accounts to access the world at large, especially when combined
with the application of a decent packet filter on the host system.

@_subject: Comcast throws down gauntlet to residential accounts 
I'm not spitting nails now, so I guess I've calmed down enough to post
this message.  Friday, while waiting for Comcast to get its act together to
deal with registration problems involving the replacement cablemodem they
brought here (still not resolved), I received the monthly call from their
insecurity division, claiming that my computer was "infected with malicious
software".  Yeah, right.  I informed the person that their monthly harassment
calls about something they obviously knew nothing about were not appreciated.
To date, they have never provided so much as an IP address or a port number
that supposedly had been attacked in any way from my system.  The person then
claimed that my system had been "connecting to botnets", but was unable or
unwilling to support that claim with any evidence and unable or unwilling
to provide even a port number via which the alleged connections had been
made.  (All of the port numbers allowed in my exit policy are reserved port
numbers by IANA or are tor-related ports or are other special purpose ports
limited to particular IP addresses, so they are all legitimate.)  That leaves
only DoS attacks, and it is difficult for me to imagine conducting any
effective DoS attacks via tor because of slowness of doing anything over tor.
I repeatedly offered to close any exit ports that had been affected, but that
they would have to tell me which ones those were.  The person refused.  I was
also told that IP addresses of the supposedly attacked systems or of the
supposedly contacted botnets could not be provided to me either.  (It was not
clear whether the alleged complaints came from the alleged botnet operator(s)
or from the supposed targets of the alleged botnets, but it struck me as
bizarre that a botnet operator would file a complaint with an ISP alleging
interference with the botnet.  I'm quite suspicious that Comcast has made the
whole thing up out of thin air.)
     Next, the conversation took a turn in a different direction.  I was told
that port 443 (my relay's DirPort) was "open facing the Internet", i.e., that
a program was actually listening on that port via the interface that connects
to the cablemodem.  I was told that having *any* ports "open facing the
Internet" was a violation of Comcast's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for
residential accounts.  During this part of the conversation I told the person
to look at   This turned out to be a mistake, probably
because the web pages there have never been updated to replace the client-
server terminology with router terminology, so the person was immediately
convinced that I was running a "server", which the person claimed was a
violation of the AUP.  This means, of course, that one cannot even run sshd
on one's system to allow secure logins from other locations to one's own
computer.  I was told that I would need to upgrade to a Comcast business-class
account if I were going to run a "server", by which they meant having any
program(s) listening on ports accessable from the Internet.
     Please note that Comcast is now running port scanners against their
customers' IP addresses to determine whether anything is listening on any
ports at those addresses.  The person I spoke with did so while talking with
me, but had already seen port scan results before calling me.  I do not know
whether they scan the full range of possible port numbers or only a subset.
The person kept mentioning that 443 was "open", but never mentioned 995,
which was the ORPort and was getting the vast majority of the traffic.
     The net result of that conversation was that I had the choice of shutting
down my relay, MYCROFTsOtherChild, or having my account terminated for a
minimum of 12 months.  I chose the former, at least while I investigate other
options, of which there are only two or three at my location.  A minimal
Comcast business account will cost $60/mo. and require either a 12-month
contract with an installation fee of over $200 or a 24-month contract with
no installation fee.  However, the Comcast business service does not *yet*
have a monthly cap, whereas I've had to throttle my relay quite severely the
past several months due to Comcast's bait-and-switch of last year when the
service sold as being "unlimited" suddenly got a 250 GB/mo. cap imposed last
October.  (Currently, I pay $40/mo. + $3/mo. for cablemodem rental and have
no contract.)
     Verizon residential service is only available at my location if I also
buy their telephone service, the combination of which would cost ~$80/mo. and
also require a 12-month contract.  I have yet to get the details on Verizon
business-class service, but it seems unlikely to be any cheaper.  Verizon's
residential service does not currently have a cap, but I don't know whether
they prohibit listening on ports accessable from the Internet.
     I exist on a shoestring, and even an increase of $17/mo. will come out
of my food intake each month, which already averages about 1.5 meals/day.
If I can manage to revive MYCROFTsOtherChild in the near future, I will do
so, but I don't yet know whether that will be feasible, and it may take a
while to make it happen even it can be done.
     Meanwhile, I see my Comcast addresses of relays on the tor status page,
and I suspect that not all of them are on Comcast business accounts.  If you
are a tor operator on a Comcast residential account, be advised that your
relay's days on that account are probably numbered, so you ought to begin
looking for a different arrangement before they call to threaten you, too.
Now that Comcast has become one of the 800 lb. gorillas among ISPs in the
U.S., it has apparently become an enemy of Internet growth, probably to
preserve its market share without having to invest competitively to keep up
with growth.  They apparently do not run Quality of Service software on
their routers, which is part of the reason they think they need to have a
250 GB/mo. cap on residential accounts, the other part being their presumed
need to inhibit Internet growth.

@_subject: Tor a carrier for Botnet traffic? 
On Tue, 01 Sep 2009 11:22:56 -0400 Ted Smith      You raise a good point.  Nevertheless, *we* aren't the ones doing
the banning, rather the ISPs are (e.g., Comcast in the U.S.), and the ISPs
are certainly not going to ban Windows.
     There's been quite a few times that, when I've called an ISP to try
to get them to fix a problem on their end, I've been told that they don't
support FreeBSD, which, of course, is irrelevant.  I don't ask them for
operating system support, just networking support on their end.  Any *BSD,
LINUX, Solaris, or other UNIX-like system provides far better tools for
diagnosing networking problems than a typical Windows system provides.
The ISPs, however, will not let customers talk with anyone at the ISP who
actually administers the networking hardware or software.  They only let
customers talk with variously trained monkeys, none of whom have ever read
any of, say, David Comer's books on TCP/IP networking, kernel design and
implementation books, Cisco Systems manuals, RFCs, etc.  The people customers
are allowed to talk with have no clue how the Internet actually works.
They have no background in it whatsoever and usually do not even have the
vocabulary necessary to understand the evidence we present to them, much
less follow the reasoning based upon the evidence that points to the problem.
     Those are the people making the decisions to threaten customers who
know what they are doing and are running tor nodes, requiring those customers
to stop running tor nodes.  They can and do call customers who run tor nodes,
claiming that the customer's computer is "infected with a virus or other
malware" and/or that the customer's computer is "being used to contact botnets",
and when challenged for evidence to support the claims, swear up and down
that the evidence exists, but that no, they cannot give it to us and, in some
cases, that they don't have access to it themselves, but that they've been
sent a report by someone else (or some program) in the company that doesn't
give any evidence or that the company has received complaints, of which they
also cannot provide copies or other details.  A rational, knowledgeable
customer will get nowhere against the ignorance of ISP employees following
irrational policies and procedures of their employers.
     The only thing I can think of that might help here is for the tor project
and all tor node operators to stop refering to tor relays as "servers".  The
relay functions are *not* server functions any more than a Cisco router is
a server.  tor relays are *software routers*, not servers.  I realize that
a node that also has an open DirPort is providing directory services, but
those services are intended for internal use by the software router network,
not by humans directly.  The fact that humans *can* use HTTP to query a
directory server is irrelevant.  The primary role of the directory servers
is to serve the software routers, not humans, and therefore ought to be
considered as the software router equivalent to routing table maintenance
     But at present, if an ISP contacts a tor node operator, claiming that
the node operator is violating an acceptable use policy prohibiting "servers",
a look at the tor project's web site merely convinces the ISP employee that
a tor node *is* a server because that's what the web pages say it is. :-(  Then
they tell the node operator to shut it down or else they will disconnect the

@_subject: [tor-relays] Call for discussion: turning funding into more 
On Fri, 27 Jul 2012 01:23:57 -0400 grarpamp      I agree completely.  But I would also like to add that, aside from
Brasil, most of South America is still dark.  Central America is not
much better either.  Many of those states are not especially cooperative
with each other, politically speaking, yet they all need the benefits of
commerce associated with the Internet.  That combination strikes me as
beneficial to placement of tor relays in as many of those countries as
     Much of Africa may be worth closer examination for the same reasons.
     We really need to keep political diversity in view, especially given
the large fractions of the tor network currently concentrated inside a
mere handful of politically allied states.  The Dictator of the U.S., for
example, has already made the threat of shutting down the entire U.S.
portion of the Internet, including relaying between other countries,
which would certainly have a severely disruptive effect upon tor users
all around the globe were it to happen under today's distribution of tor
relays.  Even more drastic would be if any of, for example, the U.K.,
France, Germany, or the Netherlands were to follow suit.  Having countries
like Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador more tor-populated looks to
me like a good thing.
     Another point I'd like to make is that I don't see why having one
100 MB/s relay is somehow better than having ten 10 MB/s relays or 20
5 MB/s relays.  The superhigh-speed relays push operating system limits
on the number of connections.  Due to tor's design, distributing the
workload of such relays across multiple CPU cores is problematic.  Olaf
Selke got around that problem by running four nodes on a quad-core
machine with two IP addresses, but that meant that each node usually ran
at less than 15 MB/s.  For a superfast setup today, it might mean running
multiple 25 MB/s nodes in similar fashion to what Olaf did, rather than
a single 100 MB/s node.  The benefit to tor users would seem to me to
be the same either way, but the multinode method would not satisfy the
demand of the funding source, as I understood it.  Either way, though,
the operating system limits may place keep a lid on the actual tor
capacity of a very fast setup.
     From an infrastructure standpoint, I acknowledge that there can be
problems in setting up really fast relays in Latin American countries.
However, adding a few relays on the order of 500 - 5,000 KB/s in each
Latin American country could probably be done, even if it meant they
could only be set up in national capitals, which are mostly
megalopolises of several million people, and might involve making
special arrangements with the ISPs.  Other major cities in some
countries may also have the infrastructure to make moderately fast
relays possible.
