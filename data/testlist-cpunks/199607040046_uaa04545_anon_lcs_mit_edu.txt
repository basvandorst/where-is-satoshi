@_subject: Wanted: NNTP posting access for remailers 
Would anyone out there be willing to give NNTP posting or transfer
privileges to anon.lcs.mit.edu?
Because of recent spams through mail2news at anon.lcs.mit.edu, I may
loose my news posting privileges to the news server I have been using.
Though I try to resolve all complaints I receive, other complaints
have been sent to other postmasters in the domain, who don't seem to
want to hear about these problems.
If you run a news server and would like to help people posting
anonymous messages, please consider allowing posts from
mail2news at anon.lcs.mit.edu.  Ideally you would also be in a position
to receive mail at some of the relevant postmaster aliases in your
domain, and would not mind forwarding misdirected complaints to me so
that I can deal with them.  Alternatively, if you are willing to give
me "IHAVE" priviliges, I can possibly set things up with an initial
"Path:" header that guarantees most complaints will go directly to me.
