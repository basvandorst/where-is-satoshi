[suggesting that Alice encrypts 24 bits of key under NSA's public key,
    Bob repeats calculation and checks that the two LEAFS are the same]
No, you're wrong, the process you've described does not work.
Note that RSA normally is used as probabilistic encryption: encrypt the
same plaintext twice, and you'll likely get two different ciphertexts.
Thus, if RSA is used in the normal probabilistic way, the receiver can't
tell whether the sender was compliant.
Now you might suggest that the sender should not include probabilistic
padding, and use RSA deterministically, so that (somehow) the receiver
can check whether those 24 bits are correct.  That again won't work,
since a third-party eavesdropper will be able to do a 2^24 brute force
calculation to recover those 24 bits.
There are complicated ways to prevent a non-compliant copy of Lotus from
inter-operating with a compliant copy (as others on cypherpunks have kindly
pointed out), but they are complicated, and would require a re-design of
Lotus Notes' encryption module.  Since the export version is interoperable
with the non-export version, this would seem to require too much foresight
and work to be very likely.
In any event, I've heard that the export version of Lotus Notes 4 always
sends a LEAF, but the receiver never checks it.  So I think a simple binary
patch to change the NSA's public key should work.
P.S.  So does anyone know how large the NSA's public LEAF key is?
