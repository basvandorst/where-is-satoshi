No, actually, after having pointed out one (and found another) bug in Pronto Secure, I find it to be an amazing piece of software!  It does everything with PGP and although it's slow at adding new keys (I presume it always checks the signatures down a few levels every time it adds one, and thus justifiably slower then straight adding a key) it's fast, efficient, and fairly easy to use.
I must admit that of the "View/Save/Inspect" options, only "Save" is very clear and the rest are (excuse the pun in advance) cryptic at best.
However, the methods used for the cryptography seem to be sound and after monitoring my COM transmissions, I haven't had it sending my secret key ring out ... ;) ... (unless they're hiding it in tiny packets ;)
My vote's in.  Thanks for the software!
        I actually think that Commtouch will not be cash poor in a few months ...
That's because they're famous and their opinion is considered to be very good.  I could see them paying Phil Zimmerman to endorse it publicly, but it wouldn't matter much because the mainstream people (the ones they're targetting with Pronto Secure) don't know who Zimmerman is ... so it's not worth they're money ...!
