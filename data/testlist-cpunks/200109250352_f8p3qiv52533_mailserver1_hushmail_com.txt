The U.S. has declared war upon terrorists and those countries that support terrorists. That means that the U.S. has declared war upon itself. This year, the U.S. continued a Clinton-era policy and committed more than $100 million in foreign aid to Afghanistan — making us the country's largest humanitarian donor. In May 2001, Secretary of State Colin Powell announced an additional $43 million in relief, which includes 65,000 tons of wheat, vegetable oil, blended foods, health programs and shelter. When the Soviet Union occupied Afghanistan, the CIA trained Osama Bin Laden and his ilk in how to commit acts of terrorism and the U.S. provided financing and arms.
