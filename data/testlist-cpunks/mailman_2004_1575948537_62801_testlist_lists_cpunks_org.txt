We shall see what happens. In the meantime, I need to make sure that
my Private Banking Guide product is updated to reflect these changes,
and hopefully offer viable alternatives. I have some ideas in mind,
but the trick is making them affordable/accessible. eGold is good
because it has such a wide customer base, or at least did. Last year,
the treasury sued the Liberty Dollar, and did some other iron fisted
things. I don't think it is a coincidence that this kind of
intimidation comes at a time when the US economy is showing signs of
serious underlying weakness.
The tor relevance is that hidden transaction network sites may be the
wave of the future. eCache is one possible contender. Any thoughts?
