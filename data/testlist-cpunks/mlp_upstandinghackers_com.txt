Why would they even need to use rubber hoses? They could just compel Amazon. How many Tor nodes are on EC2 these days, again?

Ah, fond memories of the 12k march back from my BCT FTX, which I did
on an ankle that I'd sprained twice in three days, making my way from
the rear of the column to the very front as males and females alike
fell back from fatigue. (If you sing cadence louder, the rest of you
hurts less.)
Herp derp exception that proves the rule; your argument is invalid.

So, I'm not James, nor do I have much of anything in common with him
at all, but I'm far more creeped out by Anil Dash's self-righteous
chortling over his own perception of holding Dickinson's career future
hostage than I am at Dickinson's firing.
"What is new in our time," Bertrand Russell once said, "is the
increased power of the authorities to enforce their prejudices." Let me ask you this: put me in Pax's shoes. (You can substitute
something offensive I'd be likely to say for Pax's actual words, if
that helps with the cognitive dissonance. Perhaps something about
guns. Or titties, I say some pretty crass things about titties too.)
Suppose I then ended up across that lunch table from Dash, and that
Dash had made the same "you'll never see VC if I can help it" threat.
That's where the cognitive dissonance kicks in too strongly for me to
continue the Gedankenexperiment: Dash would never make that threat to
a woman, for fear of the ANIL DASH THREATENS FEMALE ENTREPRENEUR
headlines that would flow like wine afterward. Dickinson was Fair
Game, in Dash's view, and Dash accordingly displayed all the civility
and restraint of a Hubbardite zealot, cloaked as it was under the
veneer of a genteel Manhattan business lunch.
Anil Dash fancies himself an authority, and fancies his position to be
one from which enforcing his prejudices constitutes acceptable
behaviour. The only authority he actually holds is money and
relationships with other people who have money, but his demonstrated
eagerness to use that authority to punish nonbelievers marks him as a
danger to free thought and free discourse.
Don't let that sycophantic scumbag anywhere near public office, is all
I'm sayin'.

Are you referring to the fact that whatever currency he holds is fiat
currency, or to his role as (e.g.) director of Expert Labs, or
something else? (I know little about the man's history, just glanced
at his LinkedIn.)

References: Hah! I was wondering when someone was going to start throwing parse
tree differentials at regex-based DPI.
Obviously the next step in the arms race is DPI systems that use
correct parsers, but this is hard to do at wire speed. For now,

There's an even better reason for this: BitTorrent leaks your IP. What
good does onion routing do you if the exit node can see where you are?
If you want to use BitTorrent without revealing your IP, get a VPN.
