You're referring to Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 195 (1981).  I have a half-finished article I wrote in 1994 on software algorithm patents, about 32K, available at .  It's the good part, the background material minus footnotes.  Although it's a bit dated, the description of foundational cases is still accurate.
