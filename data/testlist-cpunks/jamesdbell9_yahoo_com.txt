Group of people who burgled the FBI in 1971
On March 8, 1971, a group of anti-war activists broke into an FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania, and changed the course of history.
The burglars wound up blowing the whistle on illegal surveillance and bullying tactics employed by J. Edgar Hoover and his government agency — and despite one of the biggest FBI dragnets ever, the perpetrators were never caught and their identities remained secret… until now.
The new documentary "1971" reveals these former political radicals as they tell their story on film for the first time. At the time of the break-in, anti-war activists believed they were being watched by the FBI. Bonnie and John Raines, a married couple with three children, had participated in rallies and were photographed by suspected govenment agents. That prompted them to join the group, which eventually swiped more than 1,000 documents.
Billing themselves as 'The Citizens Commission to Investigate the FBI,' the members took serious risks to deliver the stolen FBI documents to the press. "We knew that if we got caught, we were going to face very serious prison time," says John Raines in the film (as seen in the trailer)."If the FBI was suppressing dissent, it was as important to expose that as it was to end the war," says journalist Betty Medsger, who is responsible for exposing the burglars's identities. She wrote the new book "The Burglary" and worked closely with "1971" filmmakers.
"Break into an FBI office, remove files, and mail them to newspapers," says Bonnie Raines of the plan. It was not haphazard. They cased the FBI building in Media for weeks, tracking comings and goings and drawing up detailed maps and a plan.
Multiple setbacks nearly halted the operation. "A couple of weeks before the break-in date, one person in the group dropped out — simply walked away. This person knew every detail of their plans. The risk that he would expose them was huge. They went ahead anyway," says "1971" director and producer Johanna Hamilton. "The break-in itself almost didn't happen. When the chief lock-picker arrived, he found the lock on the FBI's door was different than the one he had been practicing for. So the whole process was much more complicated and tenuous than they originally thought," she tells Yahoo Movies.
Once the documents were taken, the group spent days scanning them to find evidence of FBI wrongdoing, according to a recent New York Times report. They sent copies of the most revealing documents to journalists, one of whom was Medsger of the Washington Post. She was one of few journalists who acted on the information.
The biggest discovery was finding that Hoover ran a covert operation with the code name COINTELPRO, under which the FBI would survey, infiltrate, discredit, and disrupt political groups and U.S. citizens deemed "subversive." Much of the activity was illegal.
The burglary which exposed COINTELPRO led to the first-ever congressional investigation of U.S. intelligence agencies, and as a result the operation was terminated.The documents revealed that a wide array of postal workers, police, and even switchboard operators were used as FBI informants. Martin Luther King Jr. was a major target of COINTELPRO, with agents having him under surveillance and repeatedly bugging his home and hotel rooms.
"What is consistently amazing to me is the fact that only one of the documents they stole contained the caption COINTELPRO. It was that one document that would lead to the full revelation of FBI dirty tricks," says Hamilton.
Another stunning revelation: Hoover's program had been running since 1956. "By 1971 so many people and groups had been put under surveillance," says Hamilton. "Basically there was blanket surveillance of African Americans — both well known, like the Black Panthers, and less known, everyday people, students, people who were active in communal African-American life."
"1971" debuts at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York on April 18.

A revolutionary new method of encrypting confidential information has been patented by scientists at Lancaster University.
Read more at: 
They have been inspired by their discoveries from human biology, which model how the heart and lungs coordinate their rhythms by passing information between each other.
A mathematical model based on the complex interaction between these organs has now been transferred to the world of modern communications. 
This discovery could transform daily life which is reliant on secure electronic communications for everything from mobiles to sensor networks and the internet.
Every device, from your car key to online bank account, contains different identification codes enabling information to be transferred in confidence. But the race to outwit the hackers means there is a continual demand for better encryption methods.
Inspiration for the new method of encryption came from interdisciplinary research in the Physics Department ( by Dr Tomislav Stankovski, Professor Peter McClintock, and Professor Aneta Stefanovska, and the patent includes Dr Robert Young.
Professor McClintock commented that this is a significant discovery.
He said: "This promises an encryption scheme that is so nearly unbreakable that it will be equally unwelcome to internet criminals and official eavesdroppers."
Professor Stefanovska emphasized the interdisciplinary aspect: "As so often happens with important breakthroughs, this discovery was made right on the boundary between two different subjects – because we were applying physics to biology."
Dr Stankovski said: "Here we offer a novel encryption scheme derived from biology, radically different from any earlier procedure. Inspired by the time-varying nature of the cardio-respiratory coupling functions recently discovered in humans, we propose a new encryption scheme that is highly resistant to conventional methods of attack."
The advantage of this discovery is that it offers an infinite number of choices for the secret encryption key shared between the sender and receiver. This makes it virtually impossible for hackers and eavesdroppers to crack the code.
The new method is exceptionally resistant to interference from the random fluctuations or "noise" which affects all communications systems.
It can also transmit several different information streams simultaneously, enabling all the digital devices in the home, for example, to operate on one encryption key instead of dozens of different ones.

@_subject: Acoustic bugging of computers 
(Phys.org) —A trio of researchers in Israel has discovered that it is possible to crack 4096-bit RSA encryption keys using a microphone to listen to high-pitch noises generated by internal computer components. Adi Shamir (co-inventor of RSA), Daniel Genkin and Eran Tromer have published a research paper describing the technique on a Tel Aviv University server.
Read more at: 
Computers make noises, the researchers explain, far beyond the whirring of the fan. The CPU, for example, emits a high pitched noise as it operates, fluctuating depending on which operations it is performing—other components do likewise. Suspecting that they might be able to exploit this characteristic of computers, the researchers set about creating software to interpret noise data obtained using simple microphones and very little other equipment. They also focused exclusively on trying to achieve one single feat: deciphering an RSA encryption key. After much trial and effort, the researchers found it could be done without much effort.
Listening and detecting the noise made by a computer as it processes a single character in an encryption key would be impossible, of course, so the researchers devised a method that causes the noise to be repeated enough times in a row to enable capture of its signal. And that can only happen if the attacker is able to send a cyphertext to the machine that is to be attacked and have it processed. The cyphertext contains code that causes looping. By listening to how the computer processes the cyphertext, the researchers can map the noises made by the computer as it crunches different characters, thereby allowing encryption keys sent by others to be cracked.
What's perhaps most frightening about this method is how easily it can be ported to various machines. The researchers found, for example, that by using a laptop and simple hardware and software they were able to crack encryption keys on a second laptop. Next, they did the same thing using a cell phone as the listening device. They suggest it could also be packaged completely in software and sent out as malware, hacking encryption keys on infected devices and sending them back to the hacker.
As a side-note, the researchers also found that low-bandwidth attacks on computers are also possible by measuring the electrical potential of a computer's chassis while the circuitry is busy doing its work.

Well, I posted the article, but don't necessarily ratify the content.  However, I have never had much confidence in the RF (radio-frequency) security of computers.  That point was driven home to me in mid 1977, when I built a microprocessor-trainer board called a "Dyna Micro"         It was uncased, and I ran it near an AM/FM radio.  While listening to the AM band, away from an active station, it made numerous audio sounds as it went through the program of the keyboard scanner and programs that I entered.  It was obvious that information could be transfered by RF, although at the time I wasn't particularly concerned about the possibility.
In about 1983, I visited Washington DC, and attended some sort of military electronics convention (invited by a customer of my company, SemiDisk Systems, Inc) and I was introduced to the concept of "Tempest" shielding. 
In the summer of 2002, while a guest at the "Gated Community" of USP Atwater, California, I worked for the Federal Prison Industries ("Unicor") tearing apart electronic hardware, mostly computer monitors.  I was the only person there, either prisoner or staff, who understood what the parts were which were on the boards.  Very rarely, a computer monitor came through which I recognized was a shielded, "Tempest"-grade monitor.

Passwords vulnerable after security flaw found
By ANICK JESDANUN
6 hours ago
NEW YORK (AP) — Passwords, credit cards and other sensitive data are at risk after security researchers discovered a problem with an encryption technology used to securely transmit email, e-commerce transactions, social networking posts and other Web traffic.
Related Stories
Security researchers say the threat, known as Heartbleed, is serious, partly because it remained undiscovered for more two years. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability without leaving any trace, so anything sent during that time has potentially been compromised. It's not known, though, whether anyone has actually used it to conduct an attack.
Researchers are advising people to change all of their passwords.
The flaw was discovered independently in recent days by researchers at Google Inc. and the Finnish security firm Codenomicon.
The breach involves SSL/TLS, an encryption technology marked by the small, closed padlock and "https:" on Web browsers to signify that traffic is secure. With the Heartbleed flaw, traffic was subject to snooping even if the padlock had been closed.
The problem affects only the variant of SSL/TLS known as OpenSSL, but that happens to be one of the most common on the Internet.
Researchers at Codenomicon say that OpenSSL is used by two of the most widely used Web server software, Apache and nginx. That means many websites potentially have this security flaw. OpenSSL is also used to secure email, chats and virtual private networks, which are used by employees to connect securely with corporate networks.
Despite the worries, Codenomicon said many large consumer sites don't have the problem because of their "conservative choice" of equipment and software. "Ironically smaller and more progressive services or those who have upgraded to (the) latest and best encryption will be affected most," the security firm added.
A fix came out Monday, but affected websites and service providers must install the update.
Yahoo's Tumblr blogging service uses OpenSSL. In a blog post Tuesday, officials at the service said they had no evidence of any breach and had immediately implemented the fix.
"But this still means that the little lock icon (HTTPS) we all trusted to keep our passwords, personal emails, and credit cards safe, was actually making all that private information accessible to anyone who knew about the exploit," Tumblr's blog post read. "This might be a good day to call in sick and take some time to change your passwords everywhere — especially your high-security services like email, file storage, and banking, which may have been compromised by this bug."
Yahoo Inc. said its other services, including email, Flickr and search, also have the vulnerability. The company said some of the systems have already been fixed, while work is being done on the rest of Yahoo's websites.
The company reiterated its standard recommendation for people to change passwords regularly and to add a backup mobile number to the account. That number can be used to verify a user's identity if there are problems accessing the account because of hacking.
AP Technology Writer Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this report.

It occurred to me that I haven't heard much on the news about deliberate attacks on the healthcare.gov website, even though it is reputed to be extremely weak.  Might somebody (potentially a supporter of Obama and/or Obamacare) have deliberately 'spammed' it with fake signups, simply to get the number of such signups increased?  How vulnerable would it be to 'invented' names/addresses?  How 'valid' would these names/addresses have to be to keep the system from finding out until some arbitrary stage in the process?  If such an attack had been done, would the public ever find out, and when?

True, but I think they'd prefer to (later on) be able to blame some unknown-named and unidentifiable 'hacker-types' than to implicate themselves.   ("I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!")
This tactic wouldn't be useful at all if follow-on data (like actually-paid accounts) were released.  Probably this explains why those numbers remain elusive even today.

Yes, it's amazing how much security on the Internet is constructed on foundations of sand, 23 years (for example) after the writing of PGP.  Organizations such as the NSA and CIA should be required to show that they are pulling their own weight, by discovering and fixing these kinds of bugs.  After all, ostensibly they exist for the benefit of the citizenry of America, right?  I would question the raison d'etre of the NSA if it found itself more interested in maintaining the existence of security bugs, than of closing them.  The NSA can't claim that nobody else could find them or exploit them.
As for my idea about healthcare.gov vulnerability:  I thought of this many months ago, but I decided not to post it until the deadline had virtually expired.  (Although, it wasn't like I thought I was the only one who could imagine such a thing!).   I was amazed by the lack of discussion in the lamestream media about the potential vulnerabilities of people's personal data.  But, even more obvious to me was the fact that healthcare.gov virtually invited people to enter false data: It refused to provide people information about health care plans until they had entered their own personal information.  A person would be motivated to enter a mostly-fake set of data, solely for the purpose of getting access to the plans.
And, there was a potential 'innocent reason':  Systems like this might get 'stuck', making it difficult to correct data, and people might be tempted to initiate a new account, solely for the purpose of abandoning old data.    I realized that depending on how well healthcare.gov had been written, a cracker with a script could upload thousands or even over a million accounts, presumably for the purpose of making the account-numbers look good.

@_subject: Police inventing fake crimes  
The major flaw that I see with this case (and others like it) is that it presumes that the defendants actually BELIEVED the statements by the police, and RELIED ON them.  From the article:
"Still, undercover officers with the U.S. Secret Service and Miami Beach police told both clearly that they wanted to buy bitcoins with cash supposedly generated by the hacking of Target Corp. customer information. The undercover officers said during the secretly videotaped meetings that they planned to use the bitcoins to acquire still more stolen credit cards."
I could 'clearly tell' somebody that the Sun orbited the Earth, but that doesn't mean that the statement was factual.  Similarly, the fact that the police told these guys what the article claims they did, doesn't require that the defendants actually BELIEVED the allegations.  My expectation is that these charges will be quietly dropped:  The only ones actually committing the crime(s) are the police themselves:  The police solicited money laundering, when there were no facts (actual underlying crimes) supporting the money laundering predicate.
       Jim Bell
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Two police officers burst through a hotel room door with guns drawn, yelling "Police! Get Down!" just after an alleged money laundering transaction went down. But instead of briefcases stuffed with a drug dealer's cash, this exchange involved an undercover officer with supposedly stolen credit cards and the virtual currency bitcoin.
The February arrests of Pascal Reid and Michell Espinoza marked the first time any state has brought money laundering charges involving bitcoins, according to Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle. And it's likely to be a closely-watched test of whether criminal law can adapt to new digital forms of payment.
"These cybercriminals are way ahead of the rest of us in terms of trying to figure out ways they can launder dirty money," Rundle said.
Investigators trolled through an online directory of bitcoin traders to find the 29-year-old Reid and 30-year-old Espinoza, setting up separate meetings with each of the men at restaurants and coffee shops. They were arrested at the same Miami Beach hotel on the same day, at different times.
Defense attorneys said the men have no previous criminal records and were simply enthusiasts of the payment format that allows people to convert cash into digital money for online transactions.
Still, undercover officers with the U.S. Secret Service and Miami Beach police told both clearly that they wanted to buy bitcoins with cash supposedly generated by the hacking of Target Corp. customer information. The undercover officers said during the secretly videotaped meetings that they planned to use the bitcoins to acquire still more stolen credit cards.
"My client has never dealt in the area of stolen credit cards," said Espinoza's attorney, Rene Palomino Jr. "My client was simply selling a piece of personal property, which is what a bitcoin is. It has not been recognized as currency yet in the United States."Attorneys for Reid and Espinoza, both of whom have pleaded not guilty, say they will challenge the very legal foundations of the cases, which are being prosecuted separately. The arrest affidavits for both Reid and Espinoza refer to bitcoins as "electronic currency with no central authority."
The Internal Revenue Service issued guidance last month concluding that bitcoins can only be taxed as property and are not legal tender. Federal law enforcement agencies are watching whether bitcoins are used increasingly in criminal activity, such as the now-defunct Silk Road illegal drug marketplace.
"The idea that illicit actors might exploit the vulnerabilities of virtual currency to launder money is not merely theoretical," said Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, in a recent Florida speech to bankers.
Still, bitcoins have been gaining popularity among mainstream businesses. Overstock.com recently became the first major retailer to accept digital money and the NBA's Sacramento Kings in January announced the team would accept bitcoins, another first. They are increasingly used in restaurants, coffee shops and elsewhere.
The Latin House Grill in Coral Gables is one of the first South Florida restaurants to accept bitcoins and has been hosting meetings to educate people.Bitcoin users exchange cash for digital money using online exchanges, then store it in a computer program that serves as a wallet. The program can transfer payments directly to merchants or individuals around the world, eliminating transaction fees and the need for bank or credit card information.
"This technology can't go away. It's completely disrupted a lot of existing technology that's archaic, that hasn't evolved," said patron Andrew Barnard, who has been using bitcoins for a year.
In the Florida criminal case, Reid and Espinoza each face up to 25 years in prison if convicted of money laundering and engaging in an unlicensed money services business. Reid is free on $100,000 bail but Espinoza has been unable so far to make bail.
The transactions started small — one payment of $500 translated into about half a bitcoin — and eventually built to a proposed swap involving $30,000 in Reid's case.
"Ice cold money. Ice cold cash. Right out of the freezer," the undercover agent, holding a plastic bag of cash tells Reid on the surveillance tape. Just after Reid accepts the bag, the undercover agent says, "We're cooking with gas," an apparent signal to the officers outside to come in.
"You're a cop?" Reid is heard saying on the tape. "You're a cop?"
Reid attorney Ron Lowy said the prosecution was manufactured.
"The government is frightened of bitcoin. Apparently, they see it as an emerging, new type of economic medium of exchange, and they're worried that they're not regulating it close enough," Lowy said. "These facts do not constitute a crime."

White House, spy agencies deny NSA exploited 'Heartbleed' bug 
photoSecurity experts warn there is little Internet users can do to protect themselve\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House and U.S. intelligence agencies said on Friday neither the National Security Agency nor any other part of the government were aware before this month of the "Heartbleed" bug, denying a report that the spy agency exploited the glitch in widely used Web encryption technology to gather intelligence.
The White House, the NSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued statements after Bloomberg reported that the NSA was aware of the bug for at least two years and exploited it in order to obtain passwords and other basic information used in hacking operations. The Bloomberg report cited two unnamed sources it said were familiar with the matter.
The Heartbleed bug is considered one of the most serious Internet security flaws to be uncovered in recent years.
"Reports that NSA or any other part of the government were aware of the so-called Heartbleed vulnerability before April 2014 are wrong," White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement.
"This administration takes seriously its responsibility to help maintain an open, interoperable, secure and reliable Internet," Hayden added.
Bloomberg was not immediately available to comment.
The discovery of Heartbleed by researchers with Google Inc and a small security firm, Codenomicon, prompted the U.S. Homeland Security Department to advise businesses on Tuesday to review their servers to see if they were using vulnerable versions of widely used software known as OpenSSL.
OpenSSL is used to encrypt email and other communications and to protect the websites of big Internet companies, including Facebook Inc, Google Inc and Yahoo Inc. The bug, disclosed Monday, allows hackers to steal data without a trace.
NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said in a separate statement: "NSA was not aware of the recently identified vulnerability in OpenSSL, the so-called Heartbleed vulnerability, until it was made public in a private-sector cybersecurity report."
Hayden said the federal government relies on OpenSSL to protect the privacy of users of government websites and other online services. "If the federal government, including the intelligence community, had discovered this vulnerability prior to last week, it would have been disclosed to the community responsible for OpenSSL," Hayden added.
Hayden said that when U.S. agencies discover a new vulnerability in commercial and open-source software, "it is in the national interest to responsibly disclose the vulnerability rather than to hold it for an investigative or intelligence purpose." Such vulnerabilities are known as "zero-day" flaws because the software developers have had zero days to fix them.
In December, a five-member advisory panel convened to review electronic surveillance policy urged the White House to sharply curtail the use of undisclosed flaws and stop undercutting encryption standards. The panel included former White House cybersecurity advisor Richard Clarke.
In late February, a senior White House official said the Obama administration was intensively studying both issues.
The administration statements issued on Friday confirmed that the review had already "reinvigorated an interagency process for deciding when to share vulnerabilities" on a case-by-case basis.
The activities of the NSA have come under sharp scrutiny since former agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked numerous documents exposing expansive U.S. surveillance efforts.
Even before Snowden's emergence, former officials, including Clarke, told Reuters that offensive and spying considerations had dominated inside the NSA, causing it to withhold information instead of warning the public about new flaws.
Clarke told Reuters Friday that the NSA had not known of Heartbleed.
The U.S. government warned banks and other businesses on Friday to be on alert for hackers seeking to steal data exposed by the bug, as a German programmer who volunteered with OpenSSL took responsibility for inadvertently launching the security crisis.

I would think that at some point, the NSA would become too embarrassed to admit that they HADN'T discovered and employed such an exploit!
Which leads me to a question:  Presumably, the NSA has billions of emails locked up in Utah, or wherever they had previously used as a data-store.  Does the revelation of the Heartbleed bug mean that the NSA could have quickly logged onto millions of accounts, read emails in the clear, etc?

If they are going to 'drip, drip, drip' it, they should release it all first in hashed form, so that:
1.    We ultimately know we get it all.
2.    We know it hasn't been modified from the form it was originally in.

I strongly doubt the part about reading the newspaper from orbit.  I don't doubt that the pattern of text and pictures on the  front page could be identified from orbit. ('Identifying the difference between Pravda and Izvestia'.)   An approximation I once heard is that a lens or mirror of about 4.5 inch in diameter can resolve an angle of one arc-second.  A mirror of the size of the Hubble Space Telescope (which I assume approximates that of the typical spy satellite today) is about 20x larger, so the resolution should be 20x better, or 1/20 arc-second.  That's 1/(57 degrees per radian)(3600arcseconds per degree)(20) = 1/4,100,000 radian.  From an altitude of 500 kilometers, that's about 1/8 of a meter, or 120 millimeter.  Maybe that's a pixel-pair, but it's far too large to resolve the text on a newspaper.  
The best prospect to improve on this resolution would be to use a 'multiple-mirror-telescope' technology.  Light-gathering capability isn't important in this application; high resolution is.  Making a spy-telescope out of a few different mirrors, held precisely many meters apart, could conceivable achieve resolutions substantially greater than this.

I sure find that difficult to imagine!  Particularly because the assemblage would presumably be flying at about 500 kilometers altitude, and would therefore be buffeted by extremely-small-but-significant orbital winds.  In addition, the amount of information that would have to be interchanged (phase and amplitude, in TWO dimensions!) of an entire field of view would be phenomenal.  
What I suspect the US military would really like to see is a spy satellite at geosync altitude (22,000 miles) with an apparent aperture of perhaps 150 meters, so that it has roughly the same resolution on the ground as existing fast-orbital spy satellites.  (orbital period circa 90 minutes or so).

Curiously, I just saw this article:   (
The United States military's advanced research arm is working on a foldable space telescope that could image Earth in high resolution at a relatively low cost.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) says the telescope design — known as theMembrane Optical Imager for Real-Time Exploitation, or MOIRE — would be of great use in geosynchronous Earth orbit, the spot 22,000 miles (35,000 kilometers) up where most telecommunications satellites reside.
"Membrane optics could enable us to fit much larger, higher-resolution telescopes in smaller and lighter packages," Lt. Col. Larry Gunn, MOIRE program manager, said in a statement. [Giant Space Telescopes of the Future (Infographic)]
"In that respect, we’re ‘breaking the glass ceiling’ that traditional materials impose on optics design," Gunn added. "We’re hoping our research could also help greatly reduce overall costs and enable more timely deployment using smaller, less expensive launch vehicles."
MOIRE is now in Phase 2 of development since work began in 2010. When this phase is completed, a 16-foot (5 meters) prototype of the telescope's mirror should be completed for ground testing. No space missions have been set for MOIRE yet, DARPA officials said.
There are both advantages and disadvantages to the MOIRE design. The membrane is not as efficient as the usual glass, but it is lighter — which allows prime contractor Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. to make larger lenses to increase the telescope's efficiency. DARPA estimates that a membrane system should weigh 86 percent less than a more traditional system of the same resolution and mass.w gallery
Most telescopes either reflect light (using mirrors) or refract it (using lenses), but MOIRE's behaves differently. Each membrane will instead diffract light using a piece of equipment known as a Fresnel lens.
"It is etched with circular concentric grooves like microscopically thin tree rings, with the grooves hundreds of microns across at the center down to only 4 microns at the outside edge," DARPA officials said in a statement. "The diffractive pattern focuses light on a sensor that the satellite translates into an image."
If the design ever reaches orbit, DARPA envisions the membrane stretching to 66 feet (20 meters) in diameter — about eight times the diameter of the Hubble Space Telescope and more than three times bigger than the mirror for NASA's huge James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled to launch in 2018.
The membranes would ride to space as "petals" packed into a tight package about 20 feet (6 m) wide, small enough to fit on a rocket. These petals would then unfurl in orbit, and provide an estimated resolution of 3.3 feet (1 m).

@_subject: Jim Bell's Email crash:  Why not sue Yahoo AND the NSA? 
I just received a seeming 'boilerplate' (pre-canned) email from Yahoo email, saying that my previous account  (jamesdbell8 at yahoo.com)  will be deleted.  It does not repeat the previous claim of "abuse" on the account, but the timing of the events strongly suggests that the source of the problem was an attack on probably millions of Yahoo email addresses that has occurred over the last week or so.  Naturally, I am completely outraged that they allowed such an event to result in actual loss of 'all' data in the account.  Could it be that Yahoo's system was truly damaged so seriously as to cause the complete loss of my email and address-list database?
    However, I am reminded of the old saying, "If you get lemons, make lemonade".   Because of Edward Snowden's revelations, we have known that the NSA has been storing all domestic, and probably as many foreign, emails as they could get their grubby little hands on.   Why not a class-action lawsuit demanding that Yahoo obtain prior emails from the NSA?
     While it is difficult to sue the US (primarily due to something called "Sovereign Immunity"),  I am aware that the Federal government has already waived Sovereign immunity for everything except money damages.  (In other words, you can sue them for 'declaratory' and 'injunctive' relief:  A court could order the NSA to deliver the data back to Yahoo.)        Does anyone out in the Wide World of Cypherpunks know of an attorney wanting to take on this kind of issue?  It could put the NSA in a world of hurt for taking the data, and make them realize that one consequence of taking hold of such a massive amount of data is that they will ultimately be sued if it is necessary to recover.  It would also put email providers such as Yahoo on notice that they have additional obligations (other than those they think they have) to recover lost emails.

@_subject: Yet another interesting take on assassination markets. 
See the article by Tomasz.Wegrzanowski at gmail.com   (Spell that 5 times really fast!)
    I'd praise this guy's take on assassination markets, but since 90% of it is virtually identical to my own from January 1995 (before I'd published Part 1 of AP), that would pretty much be me patting myself on the back.      Even so, there are some things on which we disagree:  For example, TAW (Tomasz Wegrzanowski) says he believes that today's 'assassination markets' are probably scams.  (I know only of Sanjuro's "Assassination Market", and David's DPL, or Digital Prediction Lottery; Technically, DPL doesn't label itself as an 'assassination market', but for purposes of my analysis I will label it one.)  It is hypothetically possible that either or both of these are some government honey-pot, although I don't think so.  I have previously pointed out that I see little reason for any government to, now, promote a system similar to my AP idea, particularly when I wasn't promoting AP itself since my release from the Federal governments' 'gated communities' in March 2012.  Indeed, to do so would have been about as much a mistake as 2003's FutureMAP system. 
       (And I'm not implying FutureMAP was a bad idea; rather I think that to float the idea as they did led to so much negative reaction that they had to withdraw it, amazingly within one day too!)
     But I also don't believe that either system is likely to be a money- (Bitcoin-) seeking scam, either.  The reason is based on Game theory.  Imagine somebody starts up an AP-type operation.  Imagine further that it is acting is what I'd call a 'healthy' fashion, actively collecting at least dozens of hundreds of individual donations per day.   (This would be strongly impeded if the system collected minimum  donations of 1.0 BTC, like Sanjuro's system started out doing , or it was somehow not sufficiently easy to use, or it did not provide the various proofs of operational security sufficient to induce confidence in potential donors.)  I think if it was 'working', such a system would quickly develop hundreds of target-names, albeit some with tiny reward amounts,  and would certainly collect enough donations within, say, three months to raise the bounties to a level sufficient to result in at least one, uh, 'hit'.  Prior to that, many
 potential donors would still hold back, either because they weren't confident that somebody would be rewarded, or they would wait to see if something 'happened'.
     But suppose that one 'hit' occurred.  Suppose the system demonstrated that some unknown-named person had correctly predicted the date of death of the person listed. (This should be unavoidable:  It should not be possible for the system to conceal the existence of a correct donation; in any case, the public and all potential future donors would insist on the exposure of all relevant donations naming that particular target.) Would the operator 'defect' or 'cooperate' (both are terms used in Game Theory.)  Would the operator of that system actually pay the stated  amount, or would he refuse?  (I am assuming that the system was at least set up to have the technical ability to prove, to the public, that the reward had been paid to the correct predictor.)     To me, it is obvious that if the operator indeed pays the reward, and this fact can be proven to the public without revealing the true name of the correct predictor, for every Bitcoin paid out as a reward, this confidence-building measure will result in at least tens, and probably many hundreds of Bitcoins of further donations from other themselves naming other targets.  In other words, at that point it would become totally illogical for the system operator  to 'defect', to refuse to pay a (relatively) small donation, because by doing that he would be foregoing further donations that would be collectively hundreds of times larger.  (Nobody would donate to a system which provably refused to pay on a correction 'prediction', or failed to sufficiently disprove the non-payment of the reward.)        This same analysis would apply after the second 'hit', and the third, and the fourth, etc.  At no point, I think, would the 'assassination market' system operator find it financially more advantageous to refuse to pay the reward, than to pay it and remain in operation and collect far more donations.  He will always be better off by paying the reward.
    There is, however, one exception that I can think of to this analysis.  A person (or persons, or a government) might conceivably run an 'AM'-type organization, for a while, specifically for the purpose of discrediting the entire concept of AP.  That person might run the system, for a while, even paying off one, or a dozen or two, predictions, and collect a substantial reward in the process, eventually intending to run away, thereby leading to 'fear, uncertainty, and doubt' over the question of whether a credible 'AP'-type system could exist.  The big problem, for that person, is that by doing so he would be inadvertently demonstrating the proper (for awhile) functioning, and effect of, that system.  Once demonstrated to work, for that period of time, it would become obvious that such a system could, indeed, function 'properly' if the person or people involved are motivated to do so.  And, there would be nothing they could do about stopping
 credible, reliable people from initiating and running an honest AP-type organization.  Eventually, reputable systems would win out, because they would build up the longevity leading confidence as to their offers.

I have discovered this article, showing that Yahoo staff like to play games with customers, trying to dissuade them from re-activating old accounts.  But my issue, today, is far stronger:  I did not allow an account to become 'old' and 'unused':  My account (jamesdbell8 at yahoo.com) was quite literally taken from me, one week ago while I was trying to use it daily, even hourly.  (I am now using a new account, 'jamesdbell9 at yahoo.com', to communicate with you.
     Do not try to convince me that you have 'lost' my data.  That's not possible.  No doubt Yahoo has backups of backups of backups.  The data IS, indeed, 'there', somewhere.

I am talking about restoring both my contacts and my emails in account 'jamesdbell8 at yahoo.com', NOT 'jamesdbell9 at yahoo.com .  I have gotten some (effectively) rude and certainly unhelpful emails from Yahoo staff claiming that my account is supposed to be deleted soon.  I have repeatedly challenged your staff's original assertion that the account was stopped due to 'abuse'.  Due to recent public news reports, it appears that millions of Yahoo email accounts were 'hacked', or at least were attempted to be 'hacked'.   You staff has, negligently and rudely, never acknowledge the existence of this 'hacking' in regard to my own email account.
 Effectively, you blamed me for something that (maybe) somebody else did.   I believe that your software reacted very badly to whatever malicious attempts were made against my email:  I think your system has effectively deleted my account ONLY due to your own mistakes, not specifically the actions of some 'hackers'.     You need to EXPLAIN what has actually happened, why it had the effect on my email account that it did, apologize, and then immediately restore the account (including all emails and address book entries) to me.  And, you must do so IMMEDIATELY.

And Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky is his name.

I am never forget the day I first meet the great Lobachevsky.
In one word he told me secret of success in mathematics:

Remember why the good Lord made your eyes,
So don't shade your eyes,
But plagiarize, plagiarize, plagiarize -

    About my email crash:  I am merely temporarily going to 'jamesdbell9 at yahoo.com', to allow me to communicate with yahoo, hopefully to restore my past emails and address book.  Once things are back in place, I will probably migrate to a Gmail account, or something else if people recommend it. (Raising the question:  Is there a reasonably straightforward mechanism to allow a disgusted user to (easily and automatically) transfer all of his emails from one system to another?  Obviously, email service providers are motivated to try to lock in users, but maybe there's a way to fight this.)
 When I think that the hard drive on my computer has probably 300 gigabytes of freespace left, and I doubt whether the space necessary to store ALL of my inbox emails (and a large folder as well)
 probably wouldn't require 1 gigabyte!  One of the major problems with dealing with the 'cloud' computing is that we become dependent on the incompetence of third parties, for storing and maintaining services.  In principle, such people might be _more_ competent and capable, but at this point I very much long for the possibility of maintaining a 'personal backup' of email on my own computer, in parallel with anything stored elsewhere.
    So far, Yahoo has reflexively claimed that the account was terminated for 'abuse', but I think I understand what happened.,  It gave me a request to re-login since it had been a long time since I'd done that (maybe 2 weeks?); cautious about 'phishing', I opened a new window and pointed to 'Yahoo.com' and tried to log in.  I think that the system was confused, because (presumably) I was still logged onto Yahoo, the window requesting that I re-log-in.  (It is possible that this is what the computer interpreted as 'abuse'; in any case the first-level staffers have, so far, merely repeated what their software claimed.)
    In hindsight, what I suspect I SHOULD have done was to completely log off Yahoo, and THEN open up a new window and log back on.  Yahoo had some major outages about December 11, 2013       At least then, they said they'd work to restore people's data; I intend to use that promise against them.
    As for a PGP key:  I have not made a PGP key yet.  I will do so before I come down to the SF area to get it signed.  However, understand that I don't really view any PGP key I generate as being 'safe':  I am virtually assuming that my computer is, inherently, a major honey-pot (simply because it is owned by "Jim Bell"), which means that there are probably a few dozen instances of national-level malware in it, transmitting my every keystroke to NSA, GCHQ, and just about everyone else who cares.  Including, of course, my passphrases.    One thing I will want to have happen in San Francisco is to allow the meeting to exercise their anti-cracker skills to find out just how many nations have compromised my computer.  Might as well.
    I renew my offer to engage in Skype video calls with anyone, as a reasonably good proof of my identity.  It occurred to me that I could disconnect my computer from power and wired (ethernet) Internet service, maintaining WiFi, and walk out the front door of my house, all the while during said Skype call, and show (behind me) my house and car (1995 Suzuki Sidekick JLX), at the address 7214 Corregidor, Vancouver WA 98664 USA.  Anyone who installs Google Earth should be able to 'Streetview', verifying what the house looks like, etc.

By Moon Jones:
 I assume Yahoo DOES 'back up important data'.  The problem here is different:  The Yahoo computer system probably (falsely) figured that there was suspicious activity going on.  (It probably saw my logon Sunday, while I was still logged on in another window, as being suspicious).  I did not anticipate that my doing what I did was going to be a problem.  The big problem is that the Yahoo computer system precipitately reacted, quite improperly, by not merely suspending the account, but by actually deleting the entire account!   This is the computer equivalent of 'insanity'.
I have heard it said that computer features that are infrequently (or even rarely) used do not tend to be perfected.  ("Software rot"; see       )   Since only rarely would this kind of situation occur, a bug in the system would tend not to be quickly found.  Also, you are wrong for a second reason.  Yahoo (or any other email provider) could easily set up their system to keep a backup of the email data on the user's computer.  While that data, too, would be vulnerable to various events, the probability that BOTH the 'cloud'-kept data AND the user-computer-kept data becoming unavailable simultaneously should be exceedingly low.  Probably one of the reasons Yahoo doesn't take this precaution is that they are trying to lock-in users to their system.  If they gave a user's computer a copy of the entire content of the user's data, it would be too easy (for Yahoo's purposes) for the user to transfer his data to another email system:  Competing email systems would be motivated to write software to adopt such data into a new account.
Even so, I have done a Google search for an email-account transfer service.  (Turns out they exist!).  What I'd really like to do is to obtain a new email address, but simultaneously maintain 'jamesdbell8' as one email address, instructing yahoo to automatically transfer any incoming mail to a second address.  This feature would greatly ease the difficulty of transferring to a different email account.         Jim Bell  Actually the idiot is someone who just does not back up important data.
A double idiot I see. I guess that's the trouble with large providers:
they let anybody in. Hence the bad publicity.

Thank you for posting this.  You know the old saying, "misery loves company".  This fact should apply additional pressure to Yahoo to fix the problem for 'everybody' including me.  I will cite this material to Yahoo, hopefully to shame them into claiming that I 'abused' my email account.  (They STILL haven't explained what the nature of the 'abuse' was.)
'Somebody' needs to solve the 'password problem'.   Others (but not me) may be strongly tempted to re-use the same password in many sites.  I always thought that was foolish to the highest degree:  It would powerfully motivate people to set up 'honey-pot' websites, if for no other purpose that to collect passwords, figuring (correctly, unfortunately) that a large segment of society would re-use passwords.  Maybe this is already a well-discussed matter,  and I understand that a partial solution includes the use of fingerprint readers, rings, and possibly retina-scans.          Jim Bell

In a previous note on Cypherpunks, I believe I read that exposure to one of these Stingrays causes a cell phone to emit its signal at maximum power, causing a battery drain.  This suggests that a simple Stingray-detector could be built, using an old cell-phone, a power-supply with a current-limit-detector connected to an alarm.  If the cell phone emits maximum RF-signal, it will use a considerable DC power, which could be set to trigger the DC-current alarm.  (Am I correct in thinking that the old cell-phone doesn't even have to be 'active', meaning that it doesn't have to have a contracted service associated with it?)

Right now, we're gearing for MuckRock's biggest investigative project
yet, and we need your help. First, a little context.
Local police departments across America are increasingly tapping into
information from your cell phone: Your location, who you're with, who
you are calling. Using fake cell phone towers, often called Stingrays,
they generally don't even need a warrant, and have relatively few
restrictions on who, when, and what they collect. Or how they use it.
Since these programs are often funded by federal grants,  very few
people outside of law enforcement know how, or even if, they're being
used, with almost non-existent debate about if this information should
be collected, and what limits should be set for for how it's used or
how long it's kept.
This is where you come in. We're launching this project on Beacon
Reader, where a donation of just $5, about what it costs for us to
successfully file a request, can make a big difference. Just like with
the Drone Census, often times MuckRock is the *only* group asking for
this information, which otherwise would never be made public.
You can support the project at this link, and, again, even just $5 can
make a huge difference:
If you're not in a position to help financially, we would still really
appreciate your help — share what we're up to with your friends,
sending in news articles you see or tips regarding cell phone
tracking, and, in a few days, sending in information regarding which
departments you'd like us to file with through a special page on
Thanks for all your support in the past, and we're looking forward to
working with you to shine a light on this under-reported area.

@_subject: New vulnerability in OpenSSL 
BOSTON — Security researchers have uncovered new bugs in the Web encryption software that caused the pernicious “Heartbleed” Internet threat that surfaced in April.
Experts said the newly discovered vulnerabilities in OpenSSL, which could allow hackers to spy on communications, do not appear to be as serious a threat as Heartbleed.
The new bugs were disclosed on Thursday as the group responsible for developing that software released an OpenSSL update that contains seven security fixes.
Experts said that websites and technology firms that use OpenSSL technology should install the update on their systems as quickly as possible. Still, they said that could take several days or weeks because companies need to first test systems to make sure they are compatible with the update.
"They are going to have to patch. This will take some time," said Lee Weiner, senior vice president with cybersecurity software maker Rapid7.
OpenSSL technology is used on about two-thirds of all websites, including ones run by Amazon.com, Facebook, Google, and Yahoo. It is also incorporated into thousands of technology products from companies, including Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, and Oracle.
The widespread Heartbleed bug surfaced in April when it was disclosed that the flaw potentially exposed users of those websites and technologies to attack by hackers who could steal large quantities of data without leaving a trace. That prompted fear that attackers may have compromised large numbers of networks without their knowledge.
Security experts said Thursday that the newly discovered bugs are more difficult to exploit than Heartbleed, making those vulnerabilities less of a threat.
Still, until users of the technology update their systems, “there is a window of opportunity” for sophisticated hackers to launch attacks and exploit the newly uncovered vulnerabilities, said Tal Klein, vice president of strategy with cloud security firm Adallom.

Excellent point!  Although, that Utah operation might not have been functioning in 2011.  But presumably the NSA had a smaller operation somewhere else prior to that.
So, who wants to REMIND the prosecutors in IRS-gate that somebody else has these emails?
Maybe the future for the NSA will be as a type of "super-backwards-Carbonite" operation?  But instead of, "Pay us money and we'll back up your emails", it'll be, "Pay us money and we WON'T back up your emails"!!!

@_subject: Tell a lie, 
Tell a lie, remove the gear: How the NSA covers up when cable taps are found
Get caught, remove the evidence, and come up with a plausible cover story.
by Nate Anderson - June 19 2014, 10:56am PDT23Der Spiegel via Edward Snowden via NSA
Sometimes, the spooks do get caught. German magazine Der Spiegel yesterday revealed a new slide (PDF) from the Edward Snowden document cache that offers a tantalizing glimpse of what it looks like when someone stumbles on an intelligence agency cable tap.
The NSA's Special Source Operations (SSO) branch isn't in the business of computer hacking but of cable tapping; its logo shows an eagle flying above the globe and clutching a string of wires in its talons. These taps, each obscured with a codename, are often made deep within the network of telecom providers and often with the cooperation of key executives. But sometimes non-cleared people start raising questions about just what might be going on, as was the case with AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein, who revealed an NSA "secret room" in San Francisco.
On March 14, 2013, an SSO weekly briefing included a note regarding such a discovery. The unit had been informed two days earlier that "the access point for WHARPDRIVE was discovered by commercial consortium personnel. Witting partner personnel have removed the evidence and a plausible cover story was provided. All collection has ceased."
According to Der Spiegel, Wharpdrive was a fiber-optic cable tap (underseas fiber is often laid by consortia of companies, so it's possible this took place at an onshore landing point for such a cable). Employees from one of the companies involved—though not the company that had a relationship with NSA and the German intelligence agency BND—apparently noticed some unusual gear and commented on it. In response, the company involved with the NSA ("witting partner personnel") removed the tap and made up a story to explain what the gear in question had been doing.
Though the NSA lost access to Wharpdrive, it wasn't for long. Der Spiegel cites additional documents in its possession and says that "a team was quietly put together to reinstall the program."

Any reports of my demise are at least slightly in error. But, I have been laughing, a bit, about the Mt. Gox situation.  Seems to me that given that since somebody made off ("Made-off"..."Madoff";   I sure wish I had been the first one to invent that joke)  with 6% of the existing (?) supply of Bitcoin, it ought to be awfully difficult for the thief to remain entirely unknown, at least given enough time.  After all, it is well understood that Bitcoin is merely pseudonynous, not entirely anonymous.  Presuming the thief is eventually identified, I wouldn't be surprised if he (or she?) could be "convinced" to return the Bitcoin or what's left of it.  I would be in favor (of course) of withholding a portion of the recovered BTC to fund what amounts to an insurance fund to cover Bitcoin exchanges, but also Silk Road 2.0 and other systems.

Clearly, this points to the need to expand the AP/AM implementations to include 'indefinite targets': AP targets whose names aren't known at the time the donation is made.  And, even targets who really don't even exist at the time the donation is made.  Presumably, Satoshi is still alive and well, thus nobody out there (yet) has harmed him.  Somebody might want to put money (BTC) on anyone who would do so.
 I alluded to this at the time I wrote the AP essay, with my reference to using AP to attack car thieves.

If I understand your conclusions, I agree:  It would be far too dangerous to steal 6% of the world's extant Bitcoins if you actually intended to use, i.e. spend, them; but for a state-level actor, a very plausible goal would be to discredit in the public's minds Bitcoins, and that could be done merely by taking and keeping (or destroying) them.  I, of course, believe that ultimately Bitcoins (or at least, some kind of electronic currency) will be the death of all governments.   That would certainly motivate all competent governments to do anything in their power to mess up the operation of any Bitcoin storage and transmission systems.
     This is one reason that I think the idiot operators of Mt Gox must not be allowed to get "bankruptcy protection" due to the failure of their operations.  As a practical matter, they don't _need_ financial protection, for no other reason that virtually all of the BTC is already gone.  The kind of 'protection' they really need is from the bullet, the knife, the bomb, the poison, etc.  But, they should stay around long enough to help determine who took the Bitcoins, to find out who did what with them.

I am in agreement with Dan re: it being a gov't op vs 'thief'.  That was my first thought when the story broke, and nothing I've seen or heard since has changed my opinion.
 So, Jim (et al.), you say "thief" w.r.t. Bitcoin. What odds do you give that the theft was a state-level op to derail the Bitcoin economy, i.e., that making money was not the object, rather, let's imagine, that this op hedges the vulnerability of fiat currency to disintermediation. --dan

What happened is this:  Satoshi, deciding that he didn't have enough Bitcoins, stole another 800,000 BTC from  Mt. Gox, and then he hijacked the Malaysia airliner.  Location currently unknown.

"In a bit of news that's familiar to anyone who ever put on an old jacket and found $20 in the pocket, embattled Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has made a fortuitous discovery. The company announced (PDF) in Japan that it found 200,000 Bitcoin (worth nearly $116 million at the moment) in a wallet from 2011 that it no longer used. That's less than a quarter of the 850,000 Bitcoins CEO Mark Karpeles reported were missing, but at the moment, at least it's something. According to its statement, the coins were moved to online wallets on the 7th, and then to offline wallets on the 14th and 15th. The mystery of what happened to Mt. Gox's funds is still far from solved, but between this news and reports of updated balances for account holders, it seems possible that there's something to be recovered from the shuttered exchange. Next up, removing all of the cushions from the sofa and pulling it away from the wall."

For a single, tiny piece of "captcha", that might very well be true.  But suppose the telephone metadata information for a billion phone calls per day is turned into "captcha's".  How much CPU power would the NSA have to apply, each day, just to back-convert that metadata into computer-searchable form?  Admittedly, that's irrelevant:  The NSA would simply ask the court to order the company to stop being a wiseass, and to stop using the captcha technique.

Well, in this case, it doesn't really have anything to do with what the State court can _do_.  Everything would happen BEFORE the State court has an opportunity to realize what's going on.   ("May you be in Heaven 30 minutes before the Devil knows you're dead").   The purpose is to use the State court as a 'prop':  The document(s) filed with that State court will, presumably, _also_be orders in a Federal Court case which a Federal Court Judge orders some private individual to 'not disclose', as if that Federal judge had authority to do so.  But, there is also a strong presumption that people have a right to file civil cases in state courts, and such documents filed in those State courts (generally)  become public-domain documents.  (Unless somebody specifically requests that those documents be, themselves, 'sealed', and the State court judge approves this.)
If a person who is the target of a "sealed" Federal filing chooses to file the documents in a State court case, I presume he remains entitled to file those documents freely in the State court case.  And, once so file, those documents will automatically become public-domain documents (at least until they are, themselves, sealed) and they can be published on the Internet.  It would be a very tricky question whether any party in this whole mix can be 'punished' for arranging this kind of dance.  I think a lawyer would have a good-faith belief that this is a proper exercise of law.  The ultimate goal, though, is to 'legally' publish documents that some Federal judge doesn't want to see published.  Since the mere publication of those documents destroys their secrecy, I think some lawyer should look into this, for the future.

It would be a very interesting test case.  I would say it shouldn't happen, but a lot of outrages occur.
  Another version might be where an American company informs its foreign law firm of the status of the court order; the foreign law firm has a long-standing practice (contracted by the American company) of publishing the status of the NSL-status remotely.  The (American) judge would not have any jurisdiction over the foreign law firm to order it to (falsely) claim that no NSL order had arrived at the American company.  At that point, the question will be, "Can a judge order an American company to not inform its foreign law firm of relevant information (an NSL order), solely because if it did, the foreign law firm will adjust its publication of an announcement?"
