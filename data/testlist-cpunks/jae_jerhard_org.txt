Hey, since the day I heard they tried to get Rush Limbaugh, I've given
up on them.  And since all they're showing is "War War WAR", I've
given up watching.

Since Congress gave him virtually everything he asked for... what
would he need martial law for?
A. he's got everything he wants (and if he wants more, he'll get
it... a few more anthrax letters will do the trick).
B. martial law would be much too obvious, to openly hostile.  People
like Asscruft (love the term!) thrive on "under the covers" -> "nobody
realizes anything til it's too late".
