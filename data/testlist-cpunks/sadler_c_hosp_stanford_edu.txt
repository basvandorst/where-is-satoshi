<I'm a Mac user.
<MacPGP is a general nightmare.  For those of us who have shell accounts, <it is such a annoyance as to cause me to dislike using it at all except for
<the most extreme messages.
<I fear I am not of the ability, or of the spare time to work on making a <seamless application myself or else it surely would have been a project <on the top of my list.
<PGP needs to be a drop and drag application.  I want a box sitting on my <desktop, a box I can drag any document to and press two buttons after a <mouse click and drag and encrypt/decrypt/sign a message which can then be <copy/pasted to Zterm.  Currently the only thing that nears the <transparancy of this sort of thing is the bulky, annoying, poorly <packaged and massively oversized, not to mention rarely working, MacPGP <Kit.  It doesn't seem to work out to any time advantage when I factor in <the debugging and outright code crashes into my computation.
<The modular PGP project has been out there for almost a year.  Any <progress on this front?  Does anyone care?
<Now that some lists are beginning to delay or reject unsigned messages <altogether, I would really like to be able to reply to a simple note in <less than the 7 minutes it currently takes me.
<This is the single most problematic hitch in PGP.  It's not easy to use, <to install, or to apply.
<Every move toward transparent crypto simply serves to increase user base <and deter a prospective ban.  It should be in EVERYONE's interest to try <and push for a easier front end, while still allowing a flexible and <detailed set of advanced options for the expert user.
<Curve Encrypt is a classic example of simplicty and ease.  PGP front end <designers for the Mac should take its example.

I just have to say AMEN to this message. I LOVE PGP but agree with the
writer that until we make it easier to use (drag and click!), we're
losing many, many potential users out there. I, too, will keep my fingers
crossed. And who knows? Maybe one day, I'll develop enough technical
skill to do something about it myself - I'm working on it.

and BERZERK responds:
My first post, although I've been *listening* for some time now. I'm all for privacy and private encryption, and am learning a lot from this list - just installed PGP on two platforms and am learning how to use it. I agree that there are very few women involved - is this an all boys club? I assume not, but have to say I find lines like the above very offensive/non-professional. I won't let it stop me from continuing on, but what's the point? I really don't get it.

Exactly! And this is just one example of the victims. What about the extremely
high rate of crime motivated by the need for drugs? I have personally been a
victim twice (theft of my car and *nice stereo system* and a breakin to my
house where much was taken) in crimes which appeared to be motivated by the
the need for drugs. I don't see where legalizing drugs would motivate addicts
to start working to legitimately pay for their habits.

<E-cash is a bit of a reach from this, but some of them (eg, <Robertson), extend the verses to cover all forms of trackable <transactions. I suspect that if someone could get him to realize the <privacy aspects of true anonymous ecash, he'd like it.
That's making a very large assumption that someone who thinks like
Pat Robertson is a rational human being...

    Can someone tell me where I can get a copy of Kocher's paper? I haven't     read it yet.

@_subject: IRS "DataBase" 
In reference to the IRS database, I heard this announced on the radio     this morning - that the database has existed for years and that it is     being worked currently rather enthusiastically. The news announcer     somewhat eggagerated the comment that followed which seemed to make     clear the fact the we members of "John Q. Public" would NOT have access     to these records to review or correct them. The DJ and others picked it     up and talked about it afterwards and obviously did not approve. I     believe that the IRS is exempt from many laws, so is this for real???
    Digital Cash? Probably.
    Anonymous Buying? Wishful Thinking?
    Why not just get 10% tax from everyone and be done with it?

Well put! I agree wholeheartedly! I have friends who are mostly teachers and
writers who are interested in encryption from what I've told them, but their
computer knowledge is pretty much limited to their word processors. A good
user interface would do wonders for spreading the use of PGP. Unfortunately
I am not a programmer either, but I am being motivated to become one. If
only there was more time...

@_subject: Encrypted Email 
Can anybody briefly summarize for me some options for encrypting email     that are secure? I know about PGP but I need something for (my     environment) with an easy to use interface (PC-Windows) - for use by     people who really aren't very computer literate.
    Any ideas?
    Thanks!
