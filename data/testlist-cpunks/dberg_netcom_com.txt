@_subject: Cryptologist needed 
A friend has asked me to try and find someone who can solve a difficult
problem.  They have some data which has been encrypted by some
unscrupulous parties.  The data is used by an application which
runs under MS-DOS.  They're willing to pay for someone's time to
retrieve the data as it would be useful for actions they have pending.
Anyone out there who can help?  I could probably do it myself if I
knew of any available decryption software which can run under DOS.
Thanks for your attention.
