confession  i miss saved by the bell
acre of land is my favorite song of his from the spring/summer 09 toast catalog i have been laying in bed sick since monday it seems to be getting worse by the day not better i am so irritated and antsy i miss my family and i want to clean my house i really really need my bedroom to be simple and uncluttered and white for calming purposes you know what i mean
what a few hours on a sunny day can do for you
one more thought about best friends
a few months in the life of this infertile girl

cate what did you play on the computer then
isnt life surprising i was laying awake thinking last night about how different my life has gone then what i thought (in a good way) and as ive been laying in my misery ive been thinking a lot about that penny and just how lonely id be if she wasnt there with me Ill show you what ive been working on soon- theyre presents and i have to give them away first have a nice monday
