@_subject: Telephone card tech. howto needed 
Hello guys !
Here is used such telephone cards like this one here ... Sorry , not
very good picture here ;-) ... In the middle of this plastic card
 /------------\    is a chip ... See this picture here :
            |
            |                                         |      [1] [2] [3] [4]
            |       |   |   |   |             |       |   |   |   |
    ___     |        |  |   |  |    |   |    |         | |   | |
   |   |    |          [ Chip ]    -----    |           |     \
            |           |      \       \------------/       |   |   |   |                        [5] [6] [7] [8]
As you see this chip has 6 legs ... and telephone card has 8 connectors ... Only 6 are connected ... Has anyone ideas, how this card works ... i mean something like telephone card hardware tutorials or something ... I have some
ideas ... There is a something : when disconnect connector number [8] then The machine can't decrement the money value in card ... maybe he reads the value..
then he decrement the value in card , then reads "the new value" and if comparing
between the old and the new value are the same , then machine disconnects he's telephone line ... Ok ... this is only one point ... But i want to know
how this tech. works ... Anything is welcome ... please ... BTW Don't put
answers to here , please mail-to me : sagi at physic.ut.ee
