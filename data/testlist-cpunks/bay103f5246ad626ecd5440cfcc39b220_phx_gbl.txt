Hotmail could make this evident.
- Force deleted messages to remain in the Trash bin for a week after
  receipt of the message, and display all Trashed mail in the Inbox with
  red strikethrough.
- Record and display login ip addresses, dates, times, in the style of
  unix "last".
Each addresses different aspects of the problem.
If you're worried about unsophisticated attackers reading your mail, why
not use PGP or S/MIME?  That's one of the things encryption is for.  Of
course that wouldn't prevent an intruder from deleting all your mail,
but hopefully the sender would notice your lack of response and contact
you out-of-band.  Nobody should consider email a reliable communications
medium these days.
