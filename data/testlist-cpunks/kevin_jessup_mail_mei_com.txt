Just WHAT is a "hook" for crypto??  ;-) I've read about the
Microsoft crypto API, other such hooks and the "ban on
hooks", but who says a "hook" must be so "generic".
With things such as the "component object model" stuff
Microsoft is pushing and similar technologies in the UNIX
world, I can still see "hooking" to crypto.  Though perhaps
more on an application-specific basis and not so "generically".
I acknowledge that crypto which is nearly "invisible" to the
end-user will make it more widespread, and thus the need
for a generic API.
Politicians and technology: like oil and water.
