@_subject: Questions... 
Hello, I would rather I not be too blunt, but despite my generous interest in computer
 hacking cracking, and other such related topics, I have come to be confused by the
 mailer, can I ask any questions that I wish, or am I limited by some type of header
 subject?

Ok, ok... Let me say something, but I don't want anyone to take this wrong. I'm not trying to be stupid, but I don't have half the knowledge you all seem to posses. For instance what the heck is a TRS-80, DES, or even GAK? I probabl;y know or have heard but, I'm not picking up on the three letter words. So, if you could help meout maybe I just might be able to start contributing activly to this mailer!
