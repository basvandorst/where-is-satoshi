Absolutely.  That was one of my financial motivations for writing the
code, and why the "Gratis" is mentioned in the comment.
As is, I don't think there's a market available for it yet... but
having the code is a good hedge, as is the increased awareness that
it's a possible use of digital signatures.

They've resumed.  The partners had a falling out of some sort, and
the "Eric Klein" one has progressed.
The Oceania posts for the last n months can be read via NNTP from
nntp.hks.net, newsgroup hks.lists.oceania.
They're getting more productive than that.  The current plan is that
they're trying to help launch a business that designs and builds sea
structures.  They've got some pretty good ideas, and are focusing now
more on the idea of producing small tangible results that may one day
build to their desired goal.
I'm still skeptical as to their chances for success, though, but if
enough people with some pragmatic sense get sucked in, there is a chance...

Actually, both interfaces are reasonable for the scope of this discussion.
I don't have specific goals in mind yet: I want to bounce around ideas before
coming up with something more specific.
The GSSAPI has the advantage that Kerberbos services have already been
provided for that API: There's no reason, however, that the two goals
need to be mutually exclusive.  I'll have to read the GSSAPI doc carefully and get a sense of what problems
it solves.
Nevertheless, congratulations!

@_subject: Broadcasts and the Rendezvous Problem 
Seems to me that one of the fundamental building blocks necessary to
a host of anonymous services is a means of rendezvousing in a manner that
is not vulnerable to traffic analysis.
The obvious solution to this is through the use of a broadcast medium.
Has anybody created an alt.* group purely for remailer-associated
If not, it seems like that would be a very worthwhile direction to pursue:
with such a mechanism, nodes of a "remailer net" can surface and disappear
with minimal disruption to the net.
Folks spend a lot of time bemoaning the transience of specific instances
of remailer nodes: why not turn this into an advantage by architecting
a network of system that is resilient against the destruction and/or
compromise of individual nodes?

I don't see a problem.  Broadly put, news is broadcast e-mail.  There are
many sites which in fact do not distinguish between the two, the most
notable of which is CMU's Andrew Message System:  the admins of such
systems believe the "experiment" to be an all-around success.
If you want message A to get from site B to site C without a clear
trail, you've got to broadcast.  It's that simple.  It isn't a very big
problem that site B put something into the flow, so mail to news isn't
a weak point: an article can be injected at the remailer's site without
compromising the channel to traffic analysis.

Nope, no alt.anonymous.  'Leastaways, not off the servers that the turist

hear if there are MIT servers that have a larger set than life.ai's.
Alas, I am but a turist at MIT, though one who helps maintain the turist

but asking the MIT newsadmins for favors isn't in the cards.  If anybody

be way cool.
That would be a most excellent thing to do, regardless of how it affects my

AMS is pretty strongly tied to AFS (now known as part of DCE) and is
geared towards sites with users in the thousands.  It's probably not
what you want, even if it were available  (CMU is in the process of
phasing it out, since their user base usage has exceeded the design
limitations of AMS).
Take a look at newsgate, available somewhere on ftp.uu.net.  All you
have to do is set up a pseudo-site in your news server's newsfeeds file
and send the messages through news2mail.
It totally depends upon the configuration of the gateway and the format
of the message.  If your gateway passes Control: headers, then cancels
will be forwarded to the user and perhaps even be effective if they
have another mail-to-news gateway up (that allows Control: headers).
Even more so for cancels of the "Subject: cmsg cancel" format, since
everything passes Subject: headers.

Yup, that's why I qualified my statement.  Can't check on servers I don't
know about, after all.  FTR, it's not GNU that I'm on/help maintain.  It's bronze.
So, life.ai.mit.edu is a deficient newsserver and I'll switch the default
on bronze to news.mit.edu after appropriate consultations.

It's a bit slow because it has all the traffic since June.  I'll implement
"expire and archive" soon so it'll be faster.  But its usable (I'm using
it over a 19.2 SLIP connection to our local network). I understand that pine can do something much tidier, pulling newsgroups from
multiple news servers.  Read yer docs fer details.

nntp.hks.net's hks.lists.cypherpunks has back to June.  We'll continue
to keep at the very least one month back, even once we start archiving
and expiring -- and the archives will be available by ftp.  So people
need only keep pointers to Message-IDs within the archives.  I'll
almost certainly hack something together that will retrieve articles
on the Web in my copious spare time.
For now all the articles are available both via nntp for newsreaders
and ftp via ftp://ftp.hks.net/cypherpunks/nntp/cypherpunks/
(it's big).

@_subject: Fundamental Question? 
Strictly speaking, you've really only demonstrated
that there are a lot of poorly connected sites on the USENET.  The
primary characteristic that really needs to be considered is the time
for news to reach one remailer site from another.
My experience is that new propogation is fast enough that close to
real-time conversations happen all the time.  I take part in them on
the newsgroups I still read and observe them all the time.
I don't have a ready explanation for why my experience differs so much
from yours.  The worst-connected site I've ever read from was 9 mo.s ago
with a batched feed from uunet.  Even then the vast majority of posts I
saw were from the day just ending.
What are other people seeing as news delays?

AFAIK, the only interesting chunk is those corps that want some form of
"True Name" (and PKP/RSADSI, of course).
Everybody else hates them with a passion.  The Hastur crypto toolkit will
support them, but they'll be viewed as special cases of web-of-trust
signed keys with time-outs.

Seriously, this is exactly what I had in mind when I started out on the

for well-known systems like PGP included with at least minimal
auto-selection support.
See the Hastur Status thread for the one real problem that isn't just a
