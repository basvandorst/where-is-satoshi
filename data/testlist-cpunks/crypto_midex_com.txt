And so would dedicated Linux users from around the globe!  Linux is quite liberating, but security is a whole different concern.

Please keep me informed of your progress.  Does anyone out there have a somewhat comprehensive listing of these or other implementations already ported to Linux?  I am intending on setting up an alternative site for folks with nosey or suppressive employer accounts or private university accounts who desire an anonymous account somewhere else.
While they are getting better and better, I am not certain that anything is ready to be deemed as secure as it can be.
In that same spirit, does anyone have pointers to Linux specific security implementations.  I would also be interested in ported implementations of remailers, or other annonymity protecting services.

@_subject: MS Money password problem 
We recently lost (ok fired) our office manager, but not before she put nifty passwords on all the MS Money data we had and now she has, of course, gone on a three week vacation.  I have all the relevant WP password retrieving mechanisms but not one for MS Money.
Anyone with pointers or programs, your help would be greatly appreciated.

Nope.  the backups are just as protected.  Granted I doubt it is anything but trivial, but i do have a regular job and every hour i spend getting this password is a billable hour gone...

Can somebody give us an update as to how this is going.  I would like strong, real, digital cash, but until then, some of us could utilize this at the very least.  Updates or pointers?...

@_subject: IPSEC goes to RFC 
I would like to be involved with any final stages of the Linux port.  I run a now, fairly defunct business off of my Linux Box and can afford some troubles in alpha testing.  Let me know when things are near a testing stage guys.
Oh, and by the way, thanks for doing this everyone.  It is VERY important!

Can someone please summarize the experience for those of us whom were on vacation during the trial so we can learn in an abridged way?  What problems ensued (the bottlenecks, etc.) and what solutions were thought up?  Thanks.

While this would go over well in the press if handled right please let everyone remember that Jeff is a real person with bills to pay and food to put on at least his own table.  Now if someone out there with their own business is willing to match his politics with his purse and offer Jeff a job at the same level if he *decides* to leave in the midst of GAK

MT Bank could clearly benefit from a Linux-type of advocacy and support.  There are oodles of people out there with Desk Top Publishing equipment and graphics talents that could help MT/Digicash out.  Why should they?  Simply, for the benefit of the net (remember that???).
Im sure some of the folks on the WEBS mailing list could start with a rehaul of their Web Page.  Lets see if we can get at least some pro bono design work for marketing materials for real ecash.  Talk it up in the newsgroups and whatever lists you are on.  Add it to your already to lengthy  .signature.
It does appear a clumsy announcement, but nonetheless, congrats to the folks at MT and Digicash for doing their best to make e-commerce a bit more safe.
Go to then to Mark Twain
then open account
then *spend, spend, spend*

[much elided stuff]

Godmar Said:
Both of you are correct if you look carefully at the assumptions.  Rich assumes that you have a 'malicious compiler'.  Godmar is right that Java does not utilize pointers in the byte code.  What would make the entire scenario work is a malicious interpreter or a 'NotJava Browser'(TM) that allowed malicious code to be executed.  Couple a bad compiler and a bad interpreter and you are in buisness (nasty business that is).

I guess that wu-ftp never was distributed with security holes.  Never heard of anyone distributing maliscious lookalike packages.  How many folks do you think downloaded the linux-JDK and use it without checking it out first.  That takes care of the compiler.  And distributing bad netscape or other browsers is childs play.  So I guess your newborn is Stick to your belief that Java is secure because, darn it, it just would be hard for anyone to do bad things with it.  Please.

The crypto relevance of this post is tenuous at best :-).  Please keep your comments to relevant code or technical discussions of crypto.  This is *not* patronSaintPunks!  Come on!
For the humor impaired *this is a joke*.  Not flame bait.  Just trying to get Perry to lighten up a bit.

The AP line came down that the matchbook contained the algorithm for easily factoring large primes.  Apparently the drunken stupor that Tim and Perry were in dislodged a blocking mechanism in each others brains and the answer appeared to them.  Perry, being the wit he is, quickly jotted down the relevant material.
The suits were reportedly affiliated with a little known group called "CypherDietyPunks".
