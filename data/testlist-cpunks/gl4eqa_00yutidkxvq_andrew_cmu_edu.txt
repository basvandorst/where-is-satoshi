@_subject: Germany investigates AOL for providing Zundelaccess 
German prosecutors appear to be using the *threat* of charges to force
AOL and CompuServe to block access to web sites. I suspect they'd rather
not actually file formal charges...
This is escalation. Faced with criminal charges for "inciting racial
hatred" or with enraged customers if they block access to web servers in
the U.S., what will AOL do? Try to block by URL?
