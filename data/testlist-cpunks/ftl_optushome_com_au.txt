Hello all , I have signed up with Major Domo before   , but never  had the opportunity to explore  these Cyperpunk nodes he has under his command , I'm sure I'll find my place here  with minimal fuss to you all. Hopefully this email will look like it came from .au , it's a large island in the south pacific , most I know about "Oz" is that it isn't Kansas , toto.
I liked the work Allen Turing  did in the world war's , but am not  to crazy about his sexual preferences , but each to their own choices.I am also aware of Phil Zimmerman's early work , but can never seem to find the time or have the patience to get it totally sorted , this list may push me into doing something about it as I'd like to get more balance in my life status which is currently  "more street than elite"
I like to mess with the energy that normally drives these machines at 50 or 60Htz , except I crank it up to  2.45GHtz & create light at resonant frequency (which is orange ,fwiw) , I have extensive notes & knowledge on a guy called "Tesla" , you might have heard of him , he was a smart electrician from the 18th & 19th century & hung out with other guys who had SI units named after them.Tesla had some very good ideas & some very weird/bad ideas when it came to hacking  light.
Enough about me , hopefully I'll be able to contribute & enjoy this node of the Cypherpunks mail list.Look I even read the FAQ , kept it in a seperate folder for future reference & cut & pasted the part I liked about it best

I like that almost as much as Kings II chapter 18 vers 27 of the Bible , panic not I am not one to preach from this book , given the chance I'd  fist fuck God & his son with no lube.
I noticed the "algebra" domain name ,  Does the list  take it's algebra in the single dimension format  or the 3 dimensional format  , like Maxwell figured out ?
