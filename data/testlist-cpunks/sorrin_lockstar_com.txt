Actually the part that looks like executable code is just encoded and the
second part of the virus is a script to decode it. Once decoded it is
executed and it is this decoded script that actually executes the virus
methods (adding things to registry, replication and a timed DoS against some
web site in .nl)
The real interesting thing is that the virus was created by a Worm Generator
(known as VBSWG 1.50b). It creates the worm for any script kiddie, thus
doing the hard work like obfuscating the code and using randomly generated
object names as well as the replication code and Registry entries.

Yet another stupid DRM solution. One simply needs to capture the "password
protect 2nd stream" (or hack the super secure;) password protected server
site). When will they learn that secure DRM is an oxymoron.
