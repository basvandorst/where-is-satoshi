since I find Mr Geer's commentary among the most interesting and informed
of all those on this list (very odd to even suspect him of trolling), I
investigated what you wrote, and here's what I found.
your own quotation notes that IQT says "our model is unique." "unique"
because they do not consider themselves a venture firm. that same paragraph
(read whole thing at  ends: "for each dollar
that IQT invests in a company, the venture capital community invests more
than nine dollars." clearly, IQT does not see itself as part of the VC
the reasons for this look relatively straightforward: IQT is a
not-for-profit, and VC is built exclusively around making direct financial
profit from its investment. a not-for-profit VC is almost a contradiction
in terms, since "profit" and "venture" in this context mean almost the same
Practically, VCs have, as a rule, a hands-off if perhaps mentorly
relationship with their investments. that page makes clear that IQT gets
directly involved with their partner companies, probably including
technologists and technologies.
this list discusses matters of great detail and legal import frequently,
and precise accuracy in these matters strikes me as essential.
i am not endorsing what IQT does, or the correctness of Mr Geer's
statements, and I have no remote connection with any of the parties or
their services, but am very interested in the record being kept clear.

as long as we have our tinfoil hats on, one data point to keep in mind here
is to remember that USGov, despite having many uniform policies, is also
shot through with warring fiefdoms and turfs.
Snowden and Michael Hayden both have the odd career path CIA - NSA. To say
that is unusual is to make an enormous understatement. we are usually told,
"once CIA, always CIA." you can't "quit." and there are hundreds of stories
over 50+ years of history to suggest this.
CIA and NSA have often been thought not to be on the same page, largely
because NSA is military and CIA is civilian (or whatever special/uber
designation it has at this point). CIA sees itself as entitled to operate
much *more* lawlessly than NSA.
it is not hard to imagine scenarios where CIA might want to weaken NSA
capabilities in part via public embarrassment. and one involved in the plot
could even go public with his statements about how damaging the leaks are.
our noble leaker(s) would not even necessarily need to know how it was
possible to grab so much information without being stopped/noticed.

Snowden can't really sign the files if he has absolutely no access to them,
which is a critical part of the current story, otherwise we'd be right to
worry about his proximity to the FSB.

these are widely available without charge, including the actual Court
documents. the Cornell site JB mentions is excellent. Wikipedia typically
has a link to the full text of every major case and many minor ones if they
have a page for the case (which they usually do). Justia has most Supreme
Court and many other Federal court decisions at and then there is the Court itself, where you can use the general search
box or the fuller search here:
 as long as you have the
names of the litigating parties it's easy to find the whole text. I think
currently they have all decisions from the late 1990s as separate PDFs, and
earlier ones are contained in bound volumes, so you need to download the
year's volume for the case you have and then search the litigant names.
