@_subject: value of privacy? 
I use a variation on the below whenever I get a telemarketer calling -- but instead of asking for the home number, I just ask for their number, meaning work number.  Amazingly, it's very effective.  Apparently outbound telemarketers often don't want to get inbound phone calls.

@_subject: Dr. Dobb's editorial on PGP 
The December Dr. Dobb's Journal has an editorial on the current PGP legal wrangling.  I'll quote the last sentence:
    More importantly, the First Amendment guarantees us the right
    to speak in an encrypted way and insidious attempts to douse
    public access to cryptography, cloaked under the guise of
    software-export investigations, appear to stifle these rights.

@_subject: Mounting a "Secure" filesystem in UNIX 
I know you want to do this with UNIX, but Windows NT allows you do this quite nicely.  One of the "groups" of users is INTERACTIVE, another is NETWORK.  You can specifically prohibit network users from accessing a file by adding "NETWORK - No Access" to the p
ermissions list in File Manager.  I do this with secring.pgp and secring.bak, on top of the restriction which allows only me to access the file.  So even if someone guesses my password, they can't snoop on my private key except by physically being at my machi

@_subject: Bobby Inman pulling his name 
I heard on the news this morning that the White House had informally agreed with Bobby Inman's decision to pull his name from consideration for the Secretary of Defense, but wouldn't have any comment until it was formalized.  No explanation of reasons.

As documented in _The Puzzle Palace_, the name derives from Friendship International Airport, now known as Baltimore-Washington International Airport.  The Annex buildings are at the end of one of the runways.
