There are just one fuck of a lot of people in this country that really,
seriously, need killing. It is utterly amazing how quickly, because
of one incident, all these "leaders" are jumping thru the "trash
the Constitution" hoop. schemes, is "aiding and abetting terrorists". Is there no way out
of this? Only cowards worry about possible punishment.
If this be terrorism, make the most of it!
