"mending"? If they construct the proper standard can they not
control you by that choice? Is your goal in life to be controlled
by the press and the government? The very existance of the "profane" keeps the "sacred" in existance

[This is a rebuttal to a misguided news article.]
Thank you for leaving your email address. It makes this easier.
You people (read: the unaware and hypnotized masses, which includes
reporters who's desire for attention and political safety holds them
in line with the consensual illusion) keep missing the real issue, and
substituting issues which only hold themselves in place.
[Those of you who know, please excuse the mediaistic terms used in
this rebuttal. One must use the symbols one is given to communicate
at the level of understanding of those who use them.]
"Cyberspace" is interacted with using tools under the control of the
interactor. In person-to-person interaction, one's only real defense against what
one decides to call "unwanted" is to remove oneself from the arena of
interaction. It may not be possible to ignore or run away from certain
sources of input. In cyberspace, however, it is not only possible but necessary and even
desirable. Cyberspace allows one to interact with many more people
then can fit in any given physical space. One simply -cannot- receive
input from 2000 people and not employ some sort of filtering
mechanism. Indeed, cyberspace has many buttons and switches (and even
programmatic filters) which allow one to -completely- control whom one
interacts with.
Logically, we must conclude that those who frequently and repeatedly
cry for the censorship or removal of any source of input from
cyberspace are either:
or	-in need of large amounts of attention from others
Cluelessness can be overcome by appropriate teaching and interest in
learning (the latter issue we can safely assume users of popular but
ineffectual windowing OSes are not able to overcome). Such
cluelessness, however, is not and should never be a reason for A need for attention can be overcome by refraining from the denial
that the need exists, followed by careful observation of that need. More can be said on this, but this is not the forum. Such a need
is not and should never be a reason for censorship. Idelological opposition is another matter entirely. To understand this
better, we'll need to observe this in action. Here is an example:
"Nasty" is, of course, by this reporter's standard of "nasty". Granted
this standard may in fact be shared by Mr. Gilmore, however a shared
standard is not necessarily an appropriate or correct standard. Notice how, once the opposition is admitted to, the rationalization
begins. Suddenly this is not a matter of censorship, but of ownership.
Just as suddenly, the classic anti-free-speech arguments of "if you
don't like it, start yer own" begin to surface. (Anyone ever notice
how this resembles the "love it or leave it" mentality of certain
American patriotic organizations?)
What would ideological opposition be without the attempt at analogy? Here we witness another example:
Notice that the net is compared to a home or private club. Actually
the net is neither, however that would not serve the purposes of this
analogy, so this fact is convienently forgotton. The net is a wonderful place. Any ideology, no matter who disagrees or
agrees with it, can be expressed and discussed here...assuming those
who oppose this ideology do not have their way with the source of
expression. There is a more refined and deeper truth to be found
in the very existence of the set of all human ideologies, which is
just beginning to show itself to some netizens. Unfortunately, this
truth can be ruined when people equate some notion of value to sources which ignore all but a tiny subset of the set of all ideologies:
Value to whom and for what? If the editorial control produces one
small element of the set of all ideologies, then this is only of value
to the people who support this ideology. Given that the set of people who support an issue is smaller than the set of people
who support and oppose an issue, would the value not increase
by allowing both sides of an issue equal speaking time? It is sad to note that this is the leader of one of America's
forerunning organizations of freedom who says these words. For all
*his* ideology of free speech, this statement reveals the hypocrasy he
lives with for all to see. The true litmus test of free speech is to
encounter speech that you *want* to censor.
Mr. Gilmore, and other like minded parties, might want to consider
what would happen if one parent company owned *all* communications
media. Would they they be so supportive of the ideology of ownership
and communciation they espouse?

Is this another way of saying you do not understand, since you
can attribute no meaning? It never ceases to amaze me how human beings think in terms of
indoctrination and repetition. (Isn't that repetitive too?) In this example, previous works are cited as reasons why a current
work is or is not something. As most people in probability theory can
tell you, the chance of something being true has nothing to do with
the results of previous trials. In other words, your record is irrelavent. I calls 'em as I sees 'em.
And you say you aren't comparing the net to a home or club? Aren't mailing lists on the net? Aren't you comparing them to a club? Or are you merely being unclear about your comparisons? What seems to be often isn't. I am not asserting any such thing. In
fact, Mr. Gilmore hasn't done anything of note since Vulis still gets
mail off the list...it's more symbolic. Interestingly enough, the only
"damage" I see is to Mr. Gilmore's reputation. This is hardly a loss
in my opinion, but I assume it means something to a reporter...

Part, if not all, of that lack is due to our knowledge of the
subjective standard of "respectability" that human beings have.
That's the same differentiation used in many censorship attempts, and

The meta-points are:
- What is reasonable to you may or may not be reasonable to me. That is
why we refrain from censoring others, since we have no absolute
standard of reasonability.
- You appear to be concerned with convincing others. We are not
concerned with that, since we know that the default for most others is
to be invincibly unconvincable. We are simply here to be living models for an arbitrary code of behavior...that behavior being

response to this question.
The interest you seek is most probably only words of support for your position. Aiming at truth is always discouraged from those who do not
know how to seek it. If you truly had any real interest in the anti-censorship position,
you would watch your reactions to words which you yourself dislike,
and attempt to understand what it feels like to want words removed
from your reading selection by some other party. In this way, you
would understand the pro-censorship position and therefore be in
possession of enough real data to make a real decision as to which
side you are on, if any.

Whether Zionist, Sexist, Sexualist, Racist, or Net.Elitist, all

-Place great importance on "belonging to", as it relates to groups of
