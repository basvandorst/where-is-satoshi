@_subject: Bignum support added to XLISP 2.1h 
Also in the area of "bignum support", I have developed a C++ class for
large integers.  I haven't made in solid speed measurements yet, but
it seems to be relatively fast.  (More precisely, I was able to
compute large Fibonacci numbers much faster than in scheme running
under emacs.  I don't claim this to be thorough measurement in any
way!)  If anyone is interested, send me email.

My question becomes, "Is it harder to crack one encrypted transaction
for $10,000, or 100,000 plaintext transactions for the same amount?"
Answer:  Don't know.  That's why I am posting this message.

     Friend,      01 14 96 Edupage includes:      MICROCASH
     Digital Equipment filed a patent last August for a payment      system called Millicent, which enables Web-site operators      to charge as little as a tenth of a cent for each customer      "hit."      The system relies on middle-men --credit card companies or      digital banks -- to handle the transactions, but its novelty      lies in its cost-effective design geared toward tracking      minuscule amounts of cash.  To keep disk storage at a minimum,      security measures providing privacy and a trail of signed re-      ceipts are not included in the system, but proponents point out      that would-be cyberthieves would have to crack a lot of trans-      actions -- 10,000 at 0.1 cent each -- to make just $10.  "There      are easier ways to make 10 bucks," says Millicent's inventor.      (Business Week 15 Jan 96 p90)      Cordially,      Jim

@_subject: New Puzzle Palace? Re: CAQ - Secret ... 
Schneier has done a major rewrite, or at least included *lots* of new
info.  I haven't gotten a copy yet, but I saw one, and it was twice as
thick as the first version.
Now I just need the money to buy the book...

@_subject: Bignum support in C++ 
I didn't realize that so many people would be interested in big
integer support in C++.  But since I have received several requests
already, I will just post to the whole list.
I will be setting up a small web site tonight or tomorrow, so that
anyone who desires may view the code for supporting large integers in
C++.  Do not expect bulletproof optimized code.  I will post the URL
when it is ready.

Okay, I setup a quick web site for the large integer class I talked
about yesterday.  The URL is Included in the package is a quick demonstration using Fibonacci
numbers.  (Beware: the code as-is spits everything out in hex.)
Comments, suggestions, etc. are always welcome.

very large numbers (possibly as large as 256^(2^(ULONG_MAX))).
Specifically, I store the numbers in base 256, but I would like to be
able to print them in base 10.  Any really brillant ideas?

@_subject: Hack Lotus? 
Pardon my lack of faith in most crypto implementations, but do you
think it is possible that (in the first version of Notes at least) the
escrowed 24-bits will just be stored plaintext in the executable?  In
which case, a little disassembly, and we can create a hack to enable
all 64-bits.  (Of course, communications from this hacked version will
only be readable by other hacked versions or US versions.)
Anyone else think is probable?

   Just remember you brought this up...
   Not all of us even write code. Some of us write (horrors!) books! Yes, my
   brethren, I earn my pay as a lowly scribe. Do I code? Nope. Am I a
   Cypherpunk? Christ, I don't care. I'm on this mailing list; that works fine
   for me. My brain expands almost daily from contact with such seditious sods.
   Do I contribute to the health and growth of this list? Maybe. Do I preach
   the Cypherpunk doctrine through my work at my company? Definitely.    Just thought I'd point out that we aren't all code-monkeys. (And I mean that
   in the best sense of the word.)
