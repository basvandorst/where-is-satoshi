@_subject: Processor VIPER  
I am a student from Poland. I learn in Zielona Gora on Technical University of Zielona Gora. I study computing and electronics. My science on that university persist five years, now I am on fifth year. My education on that of university ends when I write and execute M.A. thesis, therefore I apply to You. Subject of my work is "Modelling and Synthesis safety processor VIPER in VHDL". VIPER takes its name from "Verifiable Integrated Processor for Enhanced Reliability" - it is the world's first microprocessor for safety-critical applications. VIPER is 32-bit microprocessor which invented at (RSRE) the UK Royal Signals and Radar Establishment for use in highly safety-critical military and civil systems. This processor is safety processor, which is used to steer systems, in which error, or mistake can't appear during work of system. These systems should characterize high precision of action. VIPER is used at nuclear plants, on board a missile, or at a chemical refinery, it's going to happen: a catastrophic computer- related disaster. My work, I execute in VHDL hardware description language. This language, I have known on studies. VHDL takes its name from "V - Very High Speed Integrated Circuit and HDL - Hardware Description Language". I apply to You; Do You know something about VIPER ?; perhaps Your friends know something about this processor. If You know something about VIPER, Could You make accessible me all materials, documentation, algorithm of programs in VHDL or another languages what You have. Thank You, I wait for answer Marek Salamaj My personal details: MAREK SALAMAJ e-mail: FOX2000 at go2.pl
