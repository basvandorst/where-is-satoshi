@_subject: chaining remailers 
Can someone point me to where I can get software to take advantage of chaining remailers for Windows 95??
Actually, can this be done through a Windows enviroment, or do I need to run

@_subject: picture encryption 
Sometime back someone mentioned a program that would hide messages inside a picture, by replacing the LSB of the color with the message.
Does anyone know where I can get this??
I was thinking that if they outlawed high strength encryption (non GAK approved), not letting them realize that you were sending encrypted information would be an excellent alternative.  Of course the message hidden in the image would be encrypted as well.  You could spend many months on trying to break the key, only to find out that it was really only a picture.

@_subject: extortion via digital cash 
Hi, I have been reading numerous threads on digital cash, and I have some
questions I would like discussed.
currently when someone does extortion (kiddnapping too), they have two 1-pick up the cash personally (or via a stooge)
2-transfer the funds via bank
Both ideas are bad, in that you stand a good chance at getting caught.
I was wondering, what if you demanded payment via Ecash, through nym servers, aliases, etc.  From what I understand, it is just like cash, ie: no record of transaction, but you get the added bonus of not having to meet the other party-like a fund transfer.  Once you have your 1,000,000 Ecash, you could dump it on a disk, and close your internet account (unless you really really trust your privacy technology).  And I also think that you would have the option to cash this into real funds at either the Mark Twain bank, or likely somewhere in the Caymen Islands (maybe through those online gambling I am hoping that this will spark some discussion, and maybe slow down the dlv, TM spam war.
Also, I was only wondering about this for mere discussion reasons :)

I would tend to think that if you held on to the money long enough, you thwart them tracking it via linkage-especially once it becomes more to do electronic transactions on the Net.  Actually, if you wait long enough, you
likely will  run the risk of there being a crackdown on nym servers, remailers, etc, and
maybe even specialy designed cancel-bots on usenet.

@_subject: PRNG discussions 
Hi, I was wondering if anyone has kept an archive of old disscusions on PRNG's.  I am playing around with a few ideas, and don't want to re-invent the wheel.
Does anyone know of any FTP sites containg this sort of thing??
