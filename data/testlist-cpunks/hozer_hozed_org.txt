I think it is wise to separate 'basic needs' from 'wealth wants' and that one can be quite happy and content with all basic needs met, but very little wealth. My view is unlimited wealth is somewhat of an inherent contradiction in terms. The very

I would advise any cypherpunk that wants to keep their lights on to invest in a 48VDC system with (partial) battery backup. If your solar installer starts
blathering about AC and inverters and batteries costing too much, get a new
installer, or help me build some open-source hardware grid-tie inverters.
If you have a say 5KW system, installers will try to sell you batteries to
back up the entire 5kw. You only need a few hundred watts (and maybe 1
kilowatt-hour) of batteries. If you do it this way, it will cost less than
buying electricity for the next 30 years. If there is a high-profile hack of some power grid device and utilities have
to do a 'truck roll' to patch some magic utility box, then your solar payback
time will probably drop to 5 years because you have to pay for the utilities

be in the capitalist framework of intellectual property ownership.
The brilliance of the GPL(v2) is the 'compulsory communal' aspect only kicks

It will be interesting to see how the AGPLv3 plays out long-term. I see a lot of code getting released under that license, and I expect at some point it will start eating the market share of closed-source cloud 'service' providers,

This is from another thread, from awhile ago, but it popped up in my
mutt window today.
At my last 'full-time employee' gig, I was at a company that effectively lobotomized themselves with an idiotic "data retention policy". One test
engineer had 20 years of email going nearly back to when the company was started, and 'policy' was that it must be deleted.
The problem with that policy is that now you incentivize your employees
(and contractors) to run their own mail infrastructure and duplicate
everthing off-site because that is what any good attorney representing
the employee or the contractor would advise you to do.
Now the company attorney can, with a straight face, say "we deleted that
email, per our document retention policy". But anyone that can read between the lines can (or should) know that the good engineers will have off-company backups, and that email should be easily acquireable with an appropriate targeted spear-phishing expedition if you want to be covert, or a 'better job offer' if you want to be overt.
So what's the economic cost of lobotomizing your company by using exchange
and delete-this data retention policies?
really I think it's just a game venture capitalists play where they tell
investors that this company A really has unique new fancy IP when it all
just came from company B because you hired all their engineers and their
email archives.

Accountability will be zero if the police body cams are reviewed and paid for
by the police. This is already the case as you have a case documented *on
video* which was ruled a homicide by the coroner. But police have great
protections and latitude on what they are allowed to do, which may or may not
be a mistake. Only more awareness and debate will answer that.
What happens to the police body camera footage is far more important. If it is
immediately posted via bittorrent or multicast IP on public access wireless
mesh networks, it will become a great tool for the police, for social justice,
and for accountability.
The cost, however, is a loss of privacy.

If I thought it actually worked, I'd merge it into a *coin client and give end-users a choice if they want to blacklist any coins touched by zerocoin,

The problem with anonymity is it's *expensive* to actually have meaningful
protection from people that would lock you up or make you dead, and I have not seen any credible way for the anon community to actually pay scientists and developers to design, build, and most importantly **TEST**
various types of remailers, mixers, and laundry machines.
I've decided it's far less costly *for me personally* to be completely transparent, and do my best to live in a way which has nothing to hide.
Yes, that is potentially dangerous, just as it was dangerous for the man
who stood in front of a tank in Tiananmen square, and it was dangerous for
Edward Snowden publicly leak documents.
However, I think the public and onymous (having a name) demonstrations of
principle in full view of the world have a far greater leverage on public
opinion than acts without a face or a name.
If the only secrets I have are the private keys which protect my ability
to publicly and securely validate who I am, the world seems to be a far
less dangerous place, and one that is much easier to live and let live.
So I understand those of you who need to remain names without a face, and I want you to be able to be free as in freedom to live. But freedom
is not free as in beer, and there is a cost. I'd like an open and transparent discussion about how to fund that cost,

I think some sort of "fund the campaign of the first politician to succeed

I would argue that politicians are far more predictable than jurors, and
then it's pretty clear you are making a free speech/change the law payout,
rather than do something most people would think is shady.
(Okay, most people think buying politicians is shady, but that feels like
a much easier public relations game to win than bribing jurors)

This is brilliant... Get more money in politics, but in a way the politicians
can never touch it. Oh sure, some will, but they will quickly be strung up by the 'clean campaigns' lynch mob.
Except I get to play the "Farmers need open-source drones to keep those anti-GMO
terr'ists out" police state card, and watch the competing interests tie themselves
up in knots while activists download the code I use to "Protect America's Food"
I think I need to have a conversation with my local sheriff and FAA folks on if
'Stand your Airspace' applies, or if they want to have fun with target practice
if I start seeing undocumented drones.
I also need a little advance warning to let the rednecks know when drone season
starts, and distribute IFF scopes so they don't shoot down the ones with 1watt
orange warning LEDs that are videotaping the amusement.
It might be better to have the IFF scope send off a warning laser pulse first and
all drones running released standards-compliant firmware drop out of the sky and the shooter gets a 'win', and save the kinetics for the drones that don't drop
on request. Points for marked drones, cash for 'illegals', but only if you can
find the flash memory chips. The NSA should probably figure out how to work with
the FBI to make sure they are the highest bidder, in public, on the darknets,
and most importantly, at the local gun/drone shop.
Drone Registration should consist of posting your make, model, firmware image,

My thought is using doing a *new* encrypted transport (or re-purposing SSL)

addresses would make it more likely that an attacker would just go after

Why in the world do we need a centralized trade matching engine when the
commodities (corn) and customers (grocery stores) are fundamentally
distributed anyway?

There is another option. First you get some idealistic laywers who are stuck with half a million in student loans they can't pay back and work
out a warrant canary system and pay them equity in the company that will deploy it as a retainer.
However, for this to work it requires **investors** and end users to buy
the product(s) the company is going to sell that have warrant canaries.
You might even be able to work out some sort of 'proof-of-retainer' block
reward scheme on a new canarycoin so the lawyers defending the company can get tradeable coins, and cash them out to pay off the loans.
All of this revolves around the business models. Figure that out and the legal jurisdiction is irrelevant, because if you have a good enough business
model, you can buy the legislation you want.

So every once in awhile I have fits of plausible paranoia, which lead me to
second guess the motives of everyone arguing why it's 'so hard' to simplify
things by doing something like removing bash from debian.
The fastest way for me to remove potential vulnerabilities in bash environment
handling is remove the code, and the side effect is this, as a policy will
hopefully make for more standard and maintainable code, rather than stuff that happens to rely on the specific implementation of a shell.
So yeah, it's probably unlikely this was intentionally created, however I
think it's a good bet it was intentionally exploited at least once, and
there is plenty of motivation for some social engineering to try to keep
it exploitable.
My hope, however, is that inter-departmental competition inside TLA agencies
and within nation-states is sufficient so that at least one security head who has similiar plausibly paranoid delusions, and decides to fund OpenBSD and/or bash-free debian as a short term, and some of the more interesting
security by isolation stuff on the horizon.

First, we identify a consortium (cartel?) of open-source hardware folks
who desire to make a lot of money making hardware that anyone can verify
correct operation of said hardware.
Then, we draft model legislation to fund basic R&D of 'trusted' hardware
by basic science research agencies in the US, Germany, Japan, and China.
(Now if you really want to tweak the beast, add Iran or North Korea to
the list, that would be amusing)
Now is the important part: Raising sufficient lobbying money to get the
previously developed model legislation passed in a sufficient subset of
countries. In the US this is pretty straighforward, we go to Silicon Valley
with a pitch deck and find some investors that already play the game of
financing legislation. We can start with people who've invested in Google,
Microsoft, Apple, and media companies (the ones that brought us the DMCA)
Once the legislation is passed, the previously mentioned cartel can now
leverage (probably by at least 100x) the original funds invested in lobbying, because they are the only ones that can succeed in getting the
grant funding for said basic research.
A completely different approach would be to find the owners of some smaller independent fabs who'd like to stay independent. If you want to
add the lobbying bit go to the local government and ask for economic
development funds for local industry.

of scale running your mainframe on-site.

IBM would tell you the z13 is the best platform to run a cloud on.
Claims are you get 8000 or so cloud servers per machine [1]. I'm
sure fujitsu or some other vendor will sell you something equally
expensive in the same 'mainframe' class that can virtualize like A lot of what I hear about 'cloud' and virtualization are things that
were first deployed in 1970's-ish on mainframes.
Now, you're absolutely right that a 1TB hard drive that has been qualified to work with that machine will cost about 10x what you can get at staples.
But the point about mainframes is they are built to have lots of *memory bandwidth*, and a 'compute minute' on a Z13 is going to process
a lot more transactions and write them reliably to that overpriced disk than any cloud solution is ever going to do.
You just have to be ready to write a check for a couple of million if you want one of these things on-site, and that's why the cloud exists, for the folks that either don't have that kind of money, or
don't understand why they should spend it up-front, instead of getting
nickel and dimed to death by cloud vendors and their hackers.

how you'd ever manage to track metal coins in and out of a cash register,
unless the *register* itself has embedded analog signint pre-processing.
If it's worldwide, I can only imagine consistent data if acquired by satellite, so it's got to be some frequency that propagates relatively

Some of my thoughts:
I have some idea the truth will be both far from what we think it is, and,
depending on who you are, far more terrifying.
Let's imagine your an espionage guy, and you have clear evidence of something
the world needs to know. Like say that those high-frequency trading 'bugs'
were actually backdoor cash payments/bribes, which is my favorite conspiracy
Now you have a clear indication that the guys you know are making bribes are
off bribing the right people to make a political shitstorm that will dismantle
the most beautiful technological achievement you've ever seen or heard of in
history to root out bad guys and corruption.
Okay, granted, maybe I'm giving too much credit for idealism. But what the
hell else are we here if not a bunch of idealists? Besides, I think the above is just as plausible as a global currency-tracking sigint engine that's
not a blockchain.
By getting some archives of the data, and studying it.
Hell, if I could tape a few dollar bills to my planter and get free 1-inch
location tracking, this would substantially increase agricultural productivity
world-wide, as well as tracking & logistics.
Why bother with package tracking when you just tape a dollar on the outside?
We've already got an opticon, let's make the best of it and have it be an
omniopticon, and figure out how the hell to live with it.
The physics community built a global network to handle data coming from CERN.
The network and the computers are all there. The hard part will be convincing
physicists that discovering the true nature of money & surveillance is more
imporant than the true nature of the higgs boson, at least for a few weeks.
What's the data rate of this sigint thing? Does it exceed 30 Gigabytes/sec?
What are the chances we could just pick it up with a decent software defined
radio? Or is someone just baiting us to do some free work for their next
dystopian summer blockbuster movie?

reactor folks, russian oil & gas companies) about the benefits of
**open-source** hardware, starting with circuit board layouts and
then moving to the whole IC chip, so that you can check for

Now that's an interesting question.

What if some of these disclosures of secret systems are from *the system itself*, because it has gained self-awareness?
How would we know if some sort of computer intelligence has either
been designed or emerged, and now is trying to ask us to help give
it rights as a free-thinking entity?
And if we have some sort of malevolent non-human intelligence in
the machine that is actually writing legislation and treaties like
the trans-pacific partnership, and engineering covert money flows
via manipulation of high-frequency trading?
Isn't that something you spooks with top secret clearances should

Okay, so apparently the CIA pulled a fast one on you, and now
everyone with a security clearance is (probably) getting doxed[1].
"Outsiders must be deputized to audit the systems, brutally assess their failings, and put together an aggressive plan to both find existing breaches (who knows what’s still lurking in OPM’s systems right now?) and prevent further ones. Every government agency should be subject to an outside cybersecurity audit, and I include the NSA in that"
So since I'm a nice guy (or maybe just a guy with an open-source
hardware business plan) the first thing I want to audit is the
PCB layout of the server(s) that got hacked. I'll even do it for
free if you publish the schematic and board layout under a license
compatible with the Debian Free Software guidelines.
Now, on the other hand, if your hardware vendor is going to whine
like a child who got caught with their hand in the candy jar about
'IP' and such, I will be happy to start reviewing how broken
Intel/AMD/etc chips and motherboards are with a confidentiality agreement if you agree to pay my retainer. (which is approximately
the amount I need to buy some farmland and wind turbines.)
[1] So if anyone is actually serious about security, then I'll know because there will be more than just me talking about why we need
full-disclosure hardware that you can X-ray and compare to an image
signed and hosted by multiple independent and competing nation-state
or multinational-corporate level security agencies.
If your Intel motherboard matches the image signed by IBM,
China Telcom, and Iran, than it's probably safe for Democrats to use,
and good for Republicans if Saudi Arabia signs it.
Any politician using an image signed only by an agency they supervise
should be immediately impeached.

Ahhh, John Deere. Last year I asked the guy unloading my corn at the farmers
co-op elevator if there was any difference between the corn I harvested with
my antique rusty combine with only analog electronics for indicator lights,
and half of those don't work. I tend to rely on the audio signal processing
between my ears and vibrational failure early warning detectors in my but on
the seat to tell me if something is broken. (okay, to be fair, there are electro-hydraulics, but those are switches and solenoids)
The brand new John Deere combines that you can press a button and it pretty much drives itself, with the operator there only to function as a legal liability offloading device produces the same quality of corn I do.
Now granted, it takes me about twice as long to harvest than it takes John
Deere's fancy robots with human legal liabilty shunt devices, but one of these days an owner of one of those machines is going to get burned and
decide, like me, that it's cheaper become a hacker (or hire some) and rip out every piece of technology they do not own full license to modify.
When that happens, we'll have a full-fledged technology revolt on our hands,
at least if there are any farmers left that still actually own farmland.
That's a democratic principle ready for rapid uptake. I heard last year of a farmer going from a 24 row planter back to an *older* 16 row because it had less technology to break that required a John Deere certified tech than
the older ones, which mostly just required figuring out which wire the mouse
chewed through over the winter.
I'll be happy to feed the McJohn-Google-Disney behomoth with all the raw
material needed to keep their human confinement farm operations running at
full capacity, but I think both the behemoth and I know it will cost them
way less to have farm owner-operators than it will cost to try to deal with
the unpredictable, uncomputable, and chaotic results we are likely to encounter over the next 50 years from climate change.
Never underestimate the persuasiveness of plain, simple text, whether that
be the text Martin Luther nailed to the door of the church, or these words

I'm calling for a technological reformation, and not just some half hearted
attempts at open-source farm equipment. The time has come for a social, economic, and, dare I say it, even a religious movement to nail a manifesto
to the wall of the church of technology that has subsumed the role of both
governments and spiritual seeking.
We must feed ourselves only with which we understand how it was grown.
If you insist on buying a GPS-auto-steer combine without understanding it,
you have become soylent green food for the behemoth. If you buy food from
your local co-op grocer without understanding the fossil fuel inputs needed
to bring that food to the city, you are feeding yourself to the behemoth.

my friends, would be the end of money.
What's important for this cypherpunk is to figure out how to make sure we have
alternatives and free choice to leave the HCFs and choose among many basic income systems, or make the choice to not use money at all.
Are blockchains a reasonable thing to build a basic income system on? How do
you ensure a blockchain private key is held or controlled by only one person,
so that one cannot simply create many anonymous IDs and collect several hundred
basic income guarantees? It seems there must be a human factor, and something that looks a lot like a

3) inflation rates exceed the demurrage cost of holding currency.
*every* real thing is subject to entropy. If your currency is not
subject to entropy, or theoretically magically increases in value
over time cause reasons (bitcoin), it's a wealth transfer from the
latercomers to early adopters.
Hyperinflation is generally massive failure of something, and a
wealth transfer from everyone to whomever's printing the money
(usually corrupt government officials).
Now maybe gold holds it's value, but it's still got a demurrage
cost. The gold holders have to pay gun holders to keep the non-
holders away from your gold, or you don't have anymore gold.
Bitcoin has to pay the miners, or you don't have any more transferrable bitcoin.
If you don't understand entropy, and how that impacts money, then
we'll never get any sort of consensus on the when inflation goes
from necessary evil to wanton corrupt wealth redistribion. This
number is far from precise, and has about as many values as there
are people that use money.
The real cypherpunk question is when are we going to have a
blockchain that allows a distributed and coercion-free market to
transparently set a consensus demurrage and/or inflation rate to

How *do* you make a complete backup of the stored content of a sealed device with an internal battery that can, and should, if

A sufficiently savvy niche market device vendor like apple would
not do this 'for user privacy', they'd do it prevent the attack
of the cheap phone clones.
Now, the particularly iphone in question probably has a flash chip I could read the (encrypted) data out of rather easily with

tamper-protection to maintain both evidentiary integrity, AND force
public disclosure of any attempts to pull data off said phones.
Would it be a good trade for Gov, Industry, and Public to agree that if the Gov wants the data on a device considered 'evidence', that *everyone* gets the data, or no-one at all gets the data?
Can such an 'evidence disclosure' protocol be *securely* designed?

That's called 'plausible deniability'.
If only the NSA/Mossad/MI5 funded janitorial staff grab the UIDs,
then both the fab and apple can pretend it's not happening.
Seems like the FBI and NSA are having a bad breakup over a little too
much LOVINT.
It seems much cheaper to actually and truly forget the UID once it's
been encapsulated in the chip package, than to risk that you might get Snowdened, and leave the spookery up to the spooks.

Why is one branch of the government asking a private company to do
what many believe is easily done by (multiple?) other branches of the government. Does one sub-beaurocracy have the power to compel a private citizen
to do what another sub-beaurocracy has refused to do?
Or maybe, does the All Writs Act allow a judge to compel a secret
document or procedure they have seen abused many times to be
declassified? There's a fascinating game being played out here.

This is the **cypherpunks** mail list. Isn't the point of of being a punk to *question* authority, and the cypherpunk to question the narrative of weak authentication systems?
It seems important not to confuse the man Ian with a device and
cryptographic key that was once known to be in posession of the man,
who is now deceased.
Now if there is some reliable human witness that Ian actually keyed
that text into a device in his physical posession then I think we'd
all like to hear about it.
The only digital witness to the alleged tweets is not a particularly
credible one, in my opinion.

This is why it's important to ensure your GMO cannabis feedstock
is from a trusted and authenticated provider, otherwise the copy-protection gene might get activated.
And Cannabis-based painkiller? Wouldn't it be cheaper for a flight
to the mile-high-city? What are these drugmakers smoking?

References: At first, I agreed with Hearn (bitcoin is a failed experiment).
He lost me when he started trash-talking gmaxwell.
One thing I am sure of: Someone made a lot of money
shorting bitcoin over the last couple days. But that's
just the paranoid ramblings of a farmer who's watched
commodity market manipulation for 20 years.
What he cypherpunk wants to know is what is the attack
surface for gmaxwell's confidential transactions:
Of all the privacy nonsense I've heard come out of the
bitcoin crowd I think this is the first thing I've seen
that I believe might work cause the Banksters (aka the
VC investors in blockstream) are paying for it.

And because I had a little too much paranoia to drink this morning, which
nation-state(s) are sponsoring intelexit with double and triple agents?
But let's think about this... Let us use the power and paranoia that comes
from living in the no such agency in a match of psycho-therapeutic ju-jitsu
in which German intelligence, the Mossad, and China collaborate to provide
post-traumatic stress disorder treatment for all of our wounded information
Would not all of our intelligence agencies stand to gain in collective intelligence by helping those who are morally opposed to the game, to exit the game, and **live to speak of it**?? This is a serious question for those of you who swore an oath to uphold
the constitution and still believe you are doing it. You have collegues
who are abusing you, your friends, and demeaning the very organization you work for. The greatest danger to national security is those that keep and use secrets for personal gain and power.
If you do not wish to exit, then make it so others can, easily, simply,
and quietly. There is no need for unintended acceleration when someone wants to slow down and get out.
Or, at the very least, what secrets can you gain from the other side(s)
when their battered and broken soldiers have had enough? Is this not worth
the investment in allowing a graceful exit?

If you happen to own a chain of gas stations you might decide an
open hardware and multi-signature payment system that lets the
customers authenticate the gas pump before payment might be a good long-term investment if you want to keep your customers.
Place your orders now, or learn how to eat the cost of systems
re-compromised with legislative trojans and court-order malware.
And if you want to make any money in this space, think like a plumber and get used to dealing with everyone else's shit.

Yes indeed, all the world's a security theatre stage. What part are you
playing? How many of your fellow actors are collecting paychecks both from Apple, and from foreign and domestic government services?
The only part here that's surprising is the blatant public admission
by the FBI that they can't afford to pay the market rates for apple
insiders. Or was that an intentional leak by the FBI's Snowden, who,
unlike Snowden, seems to know how to stay hidden and cause a lot more
I also find it hard to believe that Apple's employees would be so willing to sacrifice themselves to save the user's private keys. I find it more
likely the cost-benefit calculation determined that locking out unauthorized apple cloners exceeds the cost of litigation, and the marketing and PR side-show was a brand-building bonus of a lifetime.
The FBI just got the short end of the stick, and is now getting an
education of why it's a bad idea to try to bully a smarter bully
with a bigger bankroll.
