This is why people who don't know statistics should not be allowed to think... By no means is that number, by itself, of any significance whatsoever.  How many got canceled last election- one number I heard said 14,000.  If so then 19,000 is about what one would expect considering increased voter turnout and normal statistical fluctuations.  More importantly, the ballot was approved by both parties before the election took place.  If they didn't bitch then they don't have the right to bitch now.
