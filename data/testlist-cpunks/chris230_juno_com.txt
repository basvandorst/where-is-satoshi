@_subject: Spamming 
Why should the spammers pay for it, any more than anyone else should. They are still in some way paying for the E-Mail I assume, by keeping up a server or
paying someone else for the convienince of E-Mail.  If they tried to
force spammers to pay money they would have to have a way to decide if
someone was spamming.A good excuse to read E-Mail?

@_subject: Anonymous Remailers 
When you mail an item through more than one anonymous remailer, how does
that make it anymore anonymous, or doesn't it?
