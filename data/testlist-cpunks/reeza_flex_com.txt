@_subject: Naughty Santa 
Night Before Sexmas
Twas the night before Christmas, and God it was neat,
The kids were both gone, and my wife was in heat.
The doors were all bolted, the phone off the hook,
It was time for some nooky, by hook or by crook.
Momma in her teddy, and I in the nude,
Had just hit the bedroom and reached for the lube.
When out on the lawn there arose such a cry,
That I lost my boner and poor momma went dry.
Up to the window I sprang like an elf,
Tore back the shade while she played with herself.
The moon on the crest of the snowman we'd built,
Showed a broom up his ass, clean up to the hilt.
When what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a rusty old sleigh and eight mangy reindeer.
With a fat little driver half out of his sled,
A sock in his ear, and a bra on his head.
Sure as I'm speaking, he was as high as a kite,
And he yelled to his team, but it didn't sound right.
Whoa Shithead, whoa Asshole, whoa Stupid, whoa Putz,
Either slow down this rig or I'll cut off your nuts.
Look out for the lamp post, and don't hit the tree,
Quit shaking the sleigh, 'cause I gotta go pee.
They cleared the old lamp post, the tree got a rub,
Just as Santa leaned out and threw up on my shrub.
And then from the roof we heard such a clatter,
As each little reindeer now emptied his bladder.
I was donning my jacket to cover my ass,
When down the chimney Santa came with a crash.
His suit was all smelly with perfume galore,
He looked like a bum and he smelled like a whore.
"That was some brothel," he said with a smile,
"The reindeer are pooped, and I'll just stay here awhile."
He walked to the kitchen, himself poured a drink,
Then whipped out his pecker and pissed in the sink.
I started to laugh, my wife smiled with glee,
The old boy was hung nearly down to his knee.
Back in the den, Santa reached in his sack,
But his toys were all gone, and some new things were packed.
The first thing he found was a pair of false tits,
The next was a handgun with a penis that spits.
A box filled with condoms was Santa's next find,
And a six pack of panties, the edible kind.
A bra without nipples, a penis extension,
And several other things that I shouldn't even mention.
A fuck ring, a G-string, and all types of oil,
A dildo so long, it lay in a coil.
"This stuff ain't for kids, Mrs. Santa will shit.
So I'll leave 'em here, and then I'll just split."
He filled every stocking and then took his leave,
With one tiny butt plug tucked under his sleeve.
He sprang to his sleigh, but his feet were like lead,
Thus he fell on his ass and broke wind instead.
In time he was seated, took the reigns of his hitch,
Saying, "Take me home Rudolph, this nights been a BITCH!"
The sleigh was near gone when we heard Santa shout,
"The best thing about sex is that it never wears out!"

Any delay in earnings, harms.  Corporate earnings do more than line the

James A. Donald's claim below was mostly anonymized by a 3rd party I
shared this with, it was then forwarded to another list.
I've anonymized these two replies, and add this to the ongoing thread
for continued comment.
James?  What would be a good question to ask entity 1?
I'm not sure what this thread is about, but when I scrolled down I saw
something pretty familiar. That would be the phrase "digsig," which is
the handle of one James Donald. This guy has to be one of the nuttier
infamous people on the Internet. He has been waging an anti-Chomksy war
on various anarchist and libertarian newsgroups for OVER 5 YEARS. One of
his favorite libels is to claim that Chomsky supported the Khymer Rouge.
If Chomsky was any cuter and a Hollywood celebrity, this guy would have
been arrested for stalking a long time ago.
I don't read Usenet much, but everytime I check in, he's there posting
away. I can only imagine what his den looks like. I'm sure he has a
Chomsky picture on the dartboard and the rest of his office is arranged
to aid him in his campaign to make the world safe for libertarian
capitalists who need a life.

Exact source with quote, or shaddup.
I'm not a Chomsky fan.  I'm not a Chomsky hater.  Prior to a few months
ago, Chomsky was a name I'd heard only on this list, but not checked out.
But what James here seems to be up to is something I'm very much familiar
with, character assassination.  Give me a quote Chomsky has offered up
that is unverifiable, James, tell me where I can find this Chomsky quote
myself, so I can verify the Chomsky quote you offer up.  Verify that it
does properly exist, and then I'll seek to verify or refute the accuracy
of the Chomsky quote myself.  As it is, I'm left to verify the accuracy
of your quoting of Chomsky.  If that is all you can offer up, just get
the fuck out of my face.

Where did the "the" go?
      On the quote in question, I have a copy of Clive Ponting's Churchill
      book balanced on my knee right now, and I can confirm that the quote
      is word for word, except that the emphases have fallen off it with
      the loss of italics ('an innocent record and' 'altogether

My reason for asking for something more recent, more current, is to give
you an opportunity to demonstrate once and for all, that Chomsky is as
crooked now as you claim he was then, but I guess that's too much for you.

I posted this quote, along with your comments, at another list.
I received this, in reply:
        --a 1985 essay by Christopher Hitchens defending
    Chomsky against such charges.
As I've said, I'm not a Chomsky hater, nor am I a Chomsky admirer.  I've
heard the name on this list, but have not yet investigated him.  I've read
the page the url above leads to and must say, it makes more sense to me
than do your philippics.  It gives better attributions at first blush.  It
dissects whines such as yours and sends them to the oven, where they can
be properly roasted with flesh-searing heat, the better to reduce the
fatty content.  I shall not bother to read your paranoid posts from this
day, forward.
Go away.

You've yet to present anything he has said (with proper source), from

I'm not on Chomsky's board.
You've yet to make a coherent argument that will stand on its own, I'm
telling you a third time now:  I am not a Chomsky hater, nor am I a Chomsky
admirer; his is a name I've heard on this list, but I've not investigated
him.  I've engaged only in a campaign to verify what you've said, I've not
attempted to defend him against your accusations.
As yet, you've not presented compelling, irrefutable evidence.  After what
I've seen the past couple days, Occam's Razor tells me it is because such evidence does not exist, but I'm giving you one last chance to convince me.
Give me a valid, pre-79 quote, give me a valid, conflicting, post-79 quote,
and tell me what is damning about the two quotes, if you can.
The clock is ticking.

A vehicle badly out of tune will backfire, as will a vehicle whose driver turns the motor off for a few seconds, then turns the ignition back on as the vehicle rolls down the road.  This works better in vehicles with manual transmissions.  unburnt fuel flushed through the exhaust system ignites at once, resulting in a very noticeable backfire-like noise.
While no vehicle you've ever owned has ever backfired, you say, this does mean other vehicles are free from the phenomena.
Nice ad hominem, btw.

Defending racism?  Please show where the defendants in the lawsuit

 or other, similar
stories cover this little factoid.  I remember reading about this
lawsuit when the story first broke, this is the first I've heard that
a loaded, recently fired weapon was found in the Keenan vehicle.
Great Scott!!!  The loaded, recently fired weapon wasn't an SKS,
possibly resembling the one fired at the Keenan vehicle, was it?

Aye, noted.  Please take note of the US Army response to sudden machinegun fire from a bunker, and the US Marine response to it.  Marines have a lower life-expectancy in the field for a damn good reason, and while I have no way of knowing what prior .mil experience any of those AN members might have, I'm not about to assume they would not go charging after a vehicle, guns blazing, should they think the occupants of that vehicle had been shooting at them.

What cut and past [sic]?  The cut & paste you reference.  What did you

Craig said, the current situation is referred to as capitalism.
You asked, who refers to capitalism as socialism?
No one, they refer to it as capitalism, except it isn't really,
was what Craig said.
I pointed out, you munged what Craig had said.
Your reply, something about "it" being communism, is complete hogwash, since the original post was about the current system being _called_ capitalism, and your mistaken reply, "who calls capitalism socialism?"
I'll retract my earlier admonition:  You don't need to learn to read, you need to learn to comprehend what you read.

Perhaps the issue was the quality of RF field strength meter.  It may've
been that the bug would detect motor-running condition, and broadcast for
n minutes after motor-off condition, burst mode or other.  Alternators
produce a considerable RF field themselves, stereo shops have a brisk
business in selling RF suppressors to do-it-yourselfers who upgrade their
automobile's stereo.

She becomes a better troll and I remain true to my ideals, IOW.
You would be well-advised to question motives, here.  What do I gain by
pursuing an address on the legality of posting bomb recipes?  What does
she gain by quashing all such posts?  Why?

The cypherpunks list routinely receives posts from hotmail, aol and
other domains with the text "help me X", where X = something inadvisable
or even illegal.  Your query ranks right up there with these apparently clueless yet trolling, provocative solicitations - post something silly, expect silly responses.
Paladin Press regularly provides a catalog for bundling with one particular magazine, they advertise in nearly all the magazines of that particular and also in related genres.  I have seen their catalogs offered for sale by some reputable book/magazine sellers.
Not to mention, diligent searchers can easily find the Paladin Press website.

A coupla' years ago, there was an ongoing thread regarding the "know your neighbor" crap.
Someone, Anonymous if memory serves, posted a rather eloquent address on
what he could reasonably be expected to reveal regarding crimes he was a
witness to, but how his memory would fail more and more, the further and
further questions deviated from what was relevant to any crime that had
been witnessed.
A scenario described, a next-door neighbor "Joe" and the lady who lived
there with him.  Was the lady his wife?  Dunno, haven't seen a marriage
certificate.  Was "Joe" really "Joe"'s name?  Dunno, haven't seen birth certificates or other forms of ID.  What does "Joe" do for a living?
Dunno, I go to my own job in the morning, don't follow Joe to his.
That sort of thing.

I don't think Godwin would agree.  Godwin's Law is a natural law of Usenet
named after Mike Godwin (godwin at eff.org) concerning Usenet "discussions".
It reads, according to the Jargon File: As a Usenet discussion grows longer,
the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.
Claims that it is a debate-ender are add-ons.

The hospital in the town I grew up in had one for heating, and emergency
power in case of brown/black-outs.  It was functional and operating, when
as a lad of 15 or so, I ventured down to the basement one day.  Figure mid
1970s, for timeframe.

Then why were the troops laying siege to the compound, instead of

oh geez.  Why was it necessary to bring in tanks, special forces and
gunships for overflights?  Why, when if all they wanted was koresh,
all they had to do was wait for him to go to town again, and snatch
him off the street as he walked down the sidewalk?
Who benefited from this "necessary" show of how forcefully Reno et al.
could burn wooden buildings with people inside them?  Yeah-yeah, the
evidence is contested, re: who started the fires.  What isn't contested
is the armored vehicles poking gun muzzles through the walls.

"Show of Force" is what one nation does for benefit of others.  Perhaps
you might recognize the phrase "sabre rattling".  "Great White Fleet"???
A religious wacko who might be taking liberties does not need a show of
force, he needs an expenses paid escort to a padded room.
Your "show of force" point is not reasonable, and you are a fool to stand

Take anything Declan says with a grain of salt, too - he leaves the "CDR"

Just do some searches on the two terms, and if you have two brain cells

Once you have a better idea what the difference between the two is, you'll

Actually, I did read - the text at the top of the page, where it said

I am not willing to place my life and extremities in the safety of your anecdotal experience.   I'll take the lumps and remain steadfast; owners
of arms chambered in 7.62 NATO should not be firing .308 Win ammo in
them, unless the unit in question has been headspaced and pronounced
"safe" for the comparatively flimsy-walled .308 Win ammo, per the .308
Win headspace specifications.
It'll be interesting to see what comes of the investigation Clint McKee

I've encountered a number of people with education approaching, or beyond
their ability to comprehend.  They tend to be verbose, and nonsensical.
Take your statement above, for example.  I'm not only very educated, but not educable?  Well, knock me over with a feather.

HugeDisk Helps Confirm G.W. Bush's Reputation
     The on-line reputation of a celebrity -- from a television star to a
     high-stakes politician -- can have a dramatic effect on that person's
     career. Hate and worship sites, a slanted news media, or on-line
     chat-style commentary can all have either a positive or negative
     influence. Because an on-line reputation is something that's created
     through the mass consciousness of the Internet, it can often be
     difficult to judge exactly what a celebrity's on-line reputation may
     be. Every once in a while, however, something magical happens that
     makes it possible for a reputation to be validated through the simple
     click of a button.
                         Press Generated By This Story
                              Wired Magazine[1]
                            The Register (UK)[2]
       [1]        [2]      We at HugeDisk Men's Magazine are proud to report that, although
     entirely unwittingly, we have done our part to cement Texas Governor
     George W. Bush's on-line reputation as that of a "dumb motherfucker".
     How did we contribute to so dubious an achievement? It was easy! On
     the first installment of our Ask Hester HugeDisk column we innocently
     ran a link from the words "dumb motherfucker" to George W. Bush's
     on-line campaign store. The search engines noticed that we, along with
     a few other websites, endorsed George as a "dumb motherfucker" and
     adjusted George's search engine rankings accordingly.
     Follow the directions below to see proof that George W. Bush is the
     Internet's premier dumb motherfucker.
      1. Click here[3] to open the Yahoo! search engine in a separate window.
      2. Type the words "dumb motherfucker" into Yahoo!'s search term box.

Anyone who thinks this is a private email just because I left John's addy
in the To: line needs to learn more about mailing lists, and how easy it
is to manipulate and forge electronic documents.
John, be sure to note this email, and if any part of it is used as evidence,
be sure it is complete.

If incomplete data is presented, yeah, that would be an easy conclusion.

They aren't talking about rotating satellites though, they are talking
about geostationary ones, ones that hover over CA, or are property that
is administered from CA - not quite the same thing as passing overhead,
or every airline would end up owing to every nation and state it flies
over _for the act of flying over_ also.

Do they also land in those countries they make payments to, pick up and

Everyone?  They've all told you?  Whatever.
I think anyone who objects to profanity spoken out loud in their home
is within their rights to take action, but anyone who would censor the
rest of America as well (on a list absent a declared religious overtone
or theme especially) is possessed of a certain personal problem that
goes beyond a simple decision to refrain from use of profanity.
I'm not worried about being killfiled, it doesn't stop me from reading
what others have to say and I am free to agree or disagree with what
those others have to say.  Free speech, even for the dumb (and censorious).

The bottle is a little smaller than a 15 lb bottle, of course the 15 lb's
refers to the weight of the bottle itself, it is closer to 50 lbs if it is
fully charged with carbon dioxide (which we have no way to know whether it
it was charged or what it was (once?) charged with).

I was thinking laminated safety glass, which is only used for windshields
in the US.

And shatter they do, quite easily.  I shattered a side window in a truck

I spoke of a standard 15 lb CO2 bottle, fully charged with nozzle and horn
they weigh 49.5 lbs in the US Navy, if you are trying to remember those same
bottles then you are remembering incorrectly.  The bottle was about the same
diameter but shorter in height, so maybe PKP but I don't think the civilian
community has a true equivalent to that.  PKP bottles have 18 lbs of agent.

Tell it to the numbskull who designed the FP-180.  That number is supposed
to represent the # of gallons per minute the device will flow, but is often
jokingly associated with the weight of the "portable" piece of firefighting
gear.  Finally, the navy dispensed with them, outside of a few fixed-type
installations where there was no pretense of "portability."
 >There are many people who would have trouble holding the
 >bottle in one had and pointing the nozzle with the other.
Such people are weeded out in boot camp.  There are many people who cannot
pat their head and rub their tummy while chewing bubblegum, they are weeded
out in boot camp too.  Many of them cannot even look where they are walking,
and so we find them walking in front of traffic and all manner of places
they should not be.

15 lbs bottle, 50 lbs total weight including agent.  I'll check out the
security classification on the PMS card and if it's unrestricted, scan
one and post the url after I upload it.

It's restricted.  What was once an R-7 is now an R-24, and what was once
an across the board 49.5 lbs is now anywhere from 40 to 60 lbs, depending
on size of bottle and the material the bottle is constructed from, there
are four different weights listed.  Sorry I cannot say more.

Follow the recipe below, consume, and wait.
4 lbs. ground beef (at least 80% lean)
3 16oz can dark red kidney beans
1 4.5oz can peeled & chopped green chilies (Old El Paso or similar)
2 8oz can tomato sauce
2 6ox can tomato paste
1 large green bell pepper
1 medium white onion
3 11oz bag white corn tortilla chips, round style (Jays or similar)
2/3 to 1 cup chili powder (*)
4 tbsp masa flour (commonly used to make tortillas & tamales,
  Quaker brand or similar) (*)
2-1/2 tbsp ground oregano (*)
1-1/2 tbsp paprika
1-1/2 tbsp ground red pepper (cayenne pepper) (*)
2 tbsp minced garlic
2 to 3 tsp salt, to taste (NOT tbsp!)
NOTE 1) tbsp = tablespoon, tsp = teaspoon
NOTE 2) ingredients marked (*) are also found in popular chili mixes,
         such as "Carroll Shelby's Original Texas Brand Chili Mix" or
         "2 Alarm Chili Mix". If using these mixes instead of separate
         ingredients, you will need two packages of mix to roughly
         equal the recommended amounts.
NOTE 3) both tomato sauce and tomato paste are used in this recipe.
         This is due primarily to sugar content and really does affect
         the overall flavor.
+ Start heating 5 cups of water in a large pot over medium heat.
  Stir in salt and tomato sauce. DO NOT ALLOW TO BOIL!
+ Mix chopped onion & bell pepper with green chilies, while stirring
  in frying pan over low heat for 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl for
  later use.
+ Break up ground beef into small chunks (think of a good size for
  picking up with a tortilla chip), and place in covered frying pan to
  brown over medium heat. When half done, drain the grease. When done
  browning, drain any remaining grease, then stir in onion/pepper
  mixture from bowl.
+ While beef is browning, stir in all spices (but NOT masa flour) to
  liquid in pot, mix thoroughly.
+ When beef is browned, stir tomato sauce into liquid in pot, then
  add beef and stir very thoroughly.
+ Cover pot and allow to simmer over low heat for 1/2 hour, stirring
  every 10 minutes.
+ Stir in masa flour, and continue to simmer another 15 minutes.
  While simmering, drain liquid from beans.
+ Stir in beans, and continue to simmer another 15 minutes.
+ Serve immediately, with lots of tortilla chips for dipping (use
  instead of a spoon). A dark beer will help wash it down. If you
  would rather have soft drinks, Squirt or Fresca are excellent
  choices and their flavor complements the spices very nicely.

I'm on the Pro-Med list and if there were any positive link between
eating BSE-infected deer or elk, they'd be talking about it there.
They aren't.  Currently, there is only a recommendation that hunters
not eat brains or spinal cords.

Sure, but I wanted to know why the earlier url I posted DID NOT mention
murder rates, along with all the violent crime it did list.  Anyone can
find out what the numbers are, but will those numbers tell the story of
why the most violent of violent crimes was elided from that story?

It acknowledges the existence of common law.  Now that this has been cleared
up, your contention is that the US is not bound by, and does not follow ANY
of the precepts of English common law, is that correct?
Proceeding on the assumption of the affirmative (dangerous, but the electrons

Gee, I thought a potato was a tuber that formed from a rhizome.  You will
want to notify these folks so they can update their webpage, as well pass
the word to the references they cite.
A rhizome is a somewhat elongated usually horizontal subterranean plant
stem that is often thickened by deposits of reserve food material.  It produces shoots above and roots below, and is distinguished from a true
root in possessing buds, nodes, and usually scalelike leaves.
Rhizome |= root, potato |= root.

Your initial claim was that CNN wasn't covering it, ergo, they did not
consider it to be newsworthy, and that independent media outlets (Declan
did not list primarily, independent news sources), were missing an irony
that MayOrMayNot exist outside of Choatian Space.
