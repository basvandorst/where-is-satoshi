I haven't seen you for weeks
Dear Credit Card Holder:
The last transaction report on your credit card shows a number of transactions that have questionable background. That gives us reasons to believe that your credit card details have been stolen, and your card has been abused for making unauthorized payments.
Enclosed is the listing of transactions made with your credit card between 01.09.2008 and 03.09.2008. Please look through the enclosed document carefully and pay special attention to the last three of the listed transactions – they are the ones that we suspect to be fraudulent.
Please find time to review the enclosed account statement and confirm the transactions you have authorized in person. This would help us both to have this issue resolved as quickly as possible.
The Word-formatted copy of your transaction list is enclosed in the ZIP-compressed attachment to this message.
Till we meet again
Beatrice Hooker
Manager of Credit Card Security
