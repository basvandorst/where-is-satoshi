Dear Michael,
In order to better assist you, please provide us with more specific information as to what you are asking so that we may respond with a specific answer. Thank you for your cooperation.
The best way to learn WebSpace is probably to click the "Help" link from the top of the Excite at Home homepage and quickly read the Webspace Help page -
 Once you've created a very simple web page, and seen it work, try some of the more advanced features. This is an open-ended process, so don't expect to become a webmaster the first couple days!
If you find what look like bugs, check the FAQs, if that isn't sufficient, please call us. If you do not know your local call center's phone number, please visit  for our contact information.
