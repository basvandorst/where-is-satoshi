I think you need to take the "fascist" approach, at least officially. I would hope that, unofficially, you don't monitor, eavesdrop, etc., unless a problem requires you to. (such as receiving email from another site that attacks have been detected, originating from your systems, etc.)
If you don't take the "fascist" approach, you are granting employees a
"reasonable expectation of privacy", which you cannot, in truth, provide (without spending a lot of additional money). Once you've put your company in this position, you've now set them up for an employee to have their "privacy" violated, so you've increased the company's risk. The benefits of running a "privacy friendly" corporate system just don't outweigh the costs and risks.

don't care, but I don't want to be in the position of ensuring their

@_subject: (Off Topic) Re: FCC_ups 
(no crypto here, so delete it already)  :)
Yeah, right.
The tier one ISPs are refusing to peer with anyone that does not have at
least a T3 backbone cross-country, as they don't want to have to carry
other's bits long haul at no charge.. This is to keep "small ISP" from
opening locations all over the country, and connecting to "the Internet"
(bigger providors with cross-country capacity) without paying for the
long-haul capacity. Just because this scheme is economical on a small scale (probably only
looking at the costs of the two "ends", and considering the long haul to be "free") doesn't mean that it will work on a large scale. Large ISPs pay the same costs for infrastructure as telephone companies - or more.
POTS takes 64 Kb/s for one call, or 24 calls per T1. Analog from the CO to
your house, digital in between COs.  Packetizing the voice transmission to
carry it in IP increases the required bandwidth, unless compression is
used. Compression is getting better, but even state-of-the-art systems at
16 Kb/s sound like a bad connection on a car phone, IMHO. Go lower, and
you sound like Mickey Mouse - or Mickey on a car phone. ;)  I'd rather pay the dime lady $.10 per minute for a good connection than pay somebody else $.05-.08 for compressed audio.
On top of all that, most sound cards in PCs (today) are only capable of half-duplex audio. If you don't know why that matters, go play with your walkie-talkie a bit.
"The Internet" isn't "free", and as more delay-sensitive applications (voice, video) are added, ISPs will only become MORE aware of the demands their client's activities place on their capacity. I'd rather not see usage tarrifed on a volume basis, but this sort of approach to doing business on the 'net only makes such charges more likely.
Twenty years from now, you'll still have a few players dominating the top level - the infrastructure needed to support communications is expensive to create, maintain, and manage. The economies of scale in this industry will drive others out of the top tier. There will still be plenty of niche providors that focus on the vertical markets, and lease their bandwidth from the big players - same as today. As for whether the players will be the same as today, that depends. If the railroads had realized that they were in the transportation business, instead of the train business, they'd be flying airplanes today.
Anyone that wants to carry a large volume of traffic via the 'net will
find that either the market will dictate that they pay for the bandwidth
they use, or the FCC will. I don't see the FCC getting involved, unless
the "phone service via internet" providor tries to use the courts to get
out of paying for the bandwidth they use. They'll be restricted by the size of the "pipe" they purchase from their ISP, and the ISPs all charge more for access from larger "pipes." If they lease their own cross-country circuits, they'll pay the same (or higher) costs as the Telcos.
The large telephone companies are moving away from circuit switched networks, and towards packet switched networks - have been for years. It's called ATM, and it's not in wide use yet. There are advantages to building large scale communication systems this way, but "free bandwidth" is not one of them.

@_subject: (Off Topic) Re: FCC_ups 
I disagree - the cost doesn't stop w/ the cost of the circuit itself - installation, CPE, maintainance, management, customer service (re the purchaser of the bandwidth, not the "voice customer") all contribute to the cost. None of these costs are realy "fixed" - all are fixed+marginal, so the costs increase as bandwidth is added.
Also, I've worked with a number of large sites, as well as a large ISP - the amount of RealAudio traffic is amazing.
Yes, but having enough bandwidth to service your customer base means having enough bandwidth to service peak periods of demand - otherwise, customer satisfaction will be low. What is your point? If x bandwidth is sufficient during "off-hours", but 6x bandwidth is needed for peak periods, then either the voice providor leases 6x bandwidth, or a higher-tier providor must provide the capacity for 6x bandwidth, and lease "bandwidth on demand" to the voice providor. The infrastructure must still support 6x bandwidth, with accompanying costs. Do you think "BigTelco" will lease bandwidth on demand without charging more for high levels of use during peak hours? Not on a large scale.
This reminds me of the old arguements that "bandwidth costs would come down so fast that the Internet would be essentially free."  Haven't seen that happen yet, either.
The breakup and the addition of competition and second-tier voice
providors hasn't killed AT&T yet. If anything does, it will be bloated
corporate structure, not 2nd tier competition. (They're working on that -
funny how years ago we spent gobs of tax dollars breaking up AT&T, and now
they've gone and done it to themselves voluntarily). Most second-tier
providors differentiate themselves through marketing and/or customer
service.  Customer service is a big expensive pain in the butt. Many
larger companies out-source it anyway, when they can get away with it. Larger companies will still retail large accounts, and leave the smaller, less profitable crumbs to the niche marketers.
I still see voice over the Internet as a hobby - nobody is going to spend $800 for a telephone, er "voice terminal." If I decide to, who will I call? Only others with similar equipment? That's not very functional. Yes, this new carrier could implement equipment in each CO to convert my call to POTS systems, so I can call my computerless Grandmama from my PC - what will this do to costs?
Most of corporate America is still grappling with learning to use email. I don't see the business customer buying into voice services via PC anytime soon. The equipment costs per user are too high. I started working with a whole slew of telephony and convergence products years ago - they've been very slow to catch on.
Yes, one day voice, video, and data will all be carried on the same
infrastructure - using ATM, or a similar technology. The convergence is
inevitable. Large corporate phone switches will communicate with the outside world via packet switched, rather than circuit switched networks. This isn't the same as the "save money on phone calls by using cheap Internet bandwidth and your PC"  sales pitch, however. ob crypto (for anyone who read this far): When packet switched voice systems become a reality, how can secure calls be placed to any number? Key exchange during call set-up? How long will this make the call set-up?

I'm not familiar with the GA Tech network, but they probably didn't
"encrypt at the router."  They most likely used concentrators which would
send a the original packet only to the concentrator port registered for
the MAC (layer 2) address involved, and sent a packet with the payload
overwritten with "junk" out the other ports, to comply with ethernet rules
whereby all devices "see" the packet. Not encryption at all, but it does
defeat sniffing (on the local segment only) if configured in this manner. - r.w.

@_subject: [NOISE] Geek Apartments and Etherpunks 
What vulnerabilities? I've heard tell of some(?) that "leak" unscrambled packets if flooded with extreme traffic levels, but have never seen or verified this. Got any specifics?
Most manufacturers offer SNMP-manageable hubs, but these don't offer MAC-layer security. That usually costs a lot extra. The MAC-layer feature is not widely used.
If it is Ethernet (or any baseband technology, AFAIK), and on coax, then of course it is "promiscuous." All devices must see the packet; they're on a bus. The 10T hubs also follow the "all devices must see the packet rule", but by design; a packet is received on the "recieve" pair of one port, and transmitted on the "xmit" pairs of all ports. The secure hubs overwrite the data payload with "junk" first - no encryption involved, nothing to crack, and, as you've pointed out, without recomputing CRC.
btw - if I were in an apartment environment, I'd want the "secure hubs",
and would verify that they're actually in the secure mode. They usually
have a "learning" mode, where they simply register the MAC address most
recently assigned to each port (sort of like learning bridges - this saves
a lot of manual entry). Of course, if left in this mode, they don't do a
thing for security. On the flip side, if sucured, and you change network
cards, or bring that laptop home from the office, etc. you won't be able
to use it without the intervention of the hub's administrator. And yes, packet sniffers are easy to get a hold of; freeware is abundant. Anyone can easily use one on a segment they've got access to.

It also would have little structural integrity - if you attached it to

(The fiber doesn't even need to break, per se; microscopic cracking,
usually at the cladding, will ruin your fiber) (bird strikes would also be
a big problem, mostly for the bird)
Fiber optic cable usually has a kevlar sheath, and exterior aerial grade
fiber generally has a fiberglass rod inserted between the inner sheaths
and the exterior jacket. Water is also a factor - fiber buried in areas
where moisture is likely to be present (almost all applications) is
usually installed with a silicon gel between the interior jackets and the
exterior; water otherwise adheres to the exterior of the cladding, and
expands due to freezing. This causes fine fractures in the cladding, which
makes it more refractive - increasing chromatic dispersion, and therefore
a higher db loss on the cable. ob crypto/privacy: Anybody have a good idea for detecting a tap on exterior fiber? I'd expect an attacker to have to interupt connectivity, terminate both ends of a break, and insert an active device. Thoughts?

How is it like gambling? If I get a pyramid letter instructing me to send money to five people on the list, add my name to the bottom, send to 5 people, or whatever, there's nothing stopping me from removing all the names, adding my name and those of four friends, and passing the letter along. With an anonymous system, I could easily be all five people, without even the bother of getting five different post office boxes.
There's no gambling involved; only blantant stupidity.
The "airplane" game was an interesting slant, though. Because of the in-person "airplane" parties, people were able to make contacts and network while participating. It was still the same old trick, but some may have found the ability to "buy" (and "sell") face time worth the price of admission (Some of the "airplane" games going around were to the tune of $2500, rather than the usual $5). Your anonymous slant on this removes the only economically viable excuse for participating, though - I don't even get to meet the head of the umptysquat dept. in return for getting fleeced.
The "airplane game" was big around Washington about a year ago, and
involved a number of highly placed people who aught to have been able to recognize a Ponzi scheme when it bit them in the ass. Makes me wonder how many people are stupid enough to "play" these games.

First, reply to every message posted to the list, asking "How do I get off this list"? 1500 people will get each and every message, and if all of them respond, maybe the incomming mail will fill up the com-pute-er at your place, until little ones and zeros run out all over the floor. Your system administrator (god, to you, mortal) will then delete your account, solving your problem. If this doesn't happen, go to the place where they keep your comp-ute-erz and open the door. This make take some force, as the system administrators (gods, to you, mortal) do not like you playing with their toyz. Find the mail server. If you don't know which one is the mail server, don't despair; just start with the biggest thing with the most blinkin' lights and work your way towards the smallest. Take off the coverz of all of da mail serverz, and find the cypherpunks wire. It is probably one of the red ones, or maybe black, or something. Use a pair of wire cutters to cut the cypherpunks wires, and all wirez that look like they might be cypherpunks wirez. Be sure to leave your wristwatch inside one of the mailserverz when finished. All good system administratorz (godz, to you, mortal) do this when dey werks on da mailserverz. When you are finished, stand under the smoke detector and light up a smoke. Wait for the halon system to discharge. You will not be bothered by any more cypherpunks mail.  :)

With a very large number of ecash users, perhaps. Otherwise, you can kinda figure out which kid raided the cookie jar - he's the one with chocolate chips smeared all over his face.
Also - in order to communicate back to the perpetrator, the victim needs
to communicate to the first step in the chain. The operator of that chain
should not be held responisble for the system being used for criminal
activity IF they are unaware of such activity. However, if they are
informed that the perpetrator is forcing the victim to communicate through
their system, they are no longer unaware - privacy is one thing, aiding and abetting a crime is another. What's to keep the authorities from following the trail of crubs back to the perpetrator, other than the usual threats of "don't call the cops" and "you have 24 hours to respond?"

I have not heard this one, though every damn mailing list I'm on has people posting messages about "web servers being hacked" on a daily basis. Most of these have turned out to be "spoof" sites, like "nasa.com" instead of "nasa.gov." Big deal. Some nut even started posting the url to his "hacked nasa.com mirror site." Free advertising for a group that registers piles of domain names, and re-sells them.
I've set up a number of networks for gubmint agencies, and all but one of
these put their web servers on a completely different network with its own
feed to a commercial ISP, and no other link to any internal agency
network. If you look at the address range assigned to the web server,
you'll see that it falls within a commercial CIDR block and isn't part of
the gubmint agency's usual range. Many use "co-locate" sites AT an ISP,
and contract out the web server - it isn't on the agency network OR the
agency premesis.
If anyone does compromise the site, they won't get any proprietary info, can't use the systems to attack other "trusted" systems, etc. About all they do is prove the agency hired a less-than-thorough contractor to run the web system.
I would not be too concerned about threats to "National Security" regarding this alleged "incident."
In my experience, most of the agencies putting up web servers are fairly security aware and capable. The holes are generally elsewhere, on legacy systems set up ages ago, located at under-staffed locations still using systems installed and maintained by someone who retired (or died) years ago.

Ah, round 274,562,889 of the OS wars ...
On Mon, 2 Sep 1996, Drr Phill wrotee:
OTOH, UNIX Systems Labs was sold to Novell, who didn't do much with it, and then sold it to SCO. A free single-user license sounds suspiciously like the old Novell Personal Edition Unixware. Anybody know if this is what's being given away? I'd look, but I haven't got much use for yet another free UNIX - the two I have work fine.
If this is the old Pers. Ed., it will support one or two users via telnet/ftp in addition to console. Certainly enough for someone who wants a system for educational purposes, using X-windows to access the office, work on coding, etc.
If you want to write a commercial app. for SCO, it's darn nice of them to give you a free license to use as a development platform.
I feel so stupid for having bought all that Sun Microsystems and HP stock years ago ...
It is a good platform for many applications; running a desktop OS for a user who only types memos and takes phone messages probably isn't one of them, although I'm sure I'll hear from someone who disagrees.
It does make a good, scalable base for SQL databases, is the primary handler of email, runs a lot of the world's engineering software, etc ...
I'm sure if you looked around you'd even find Solitaire for it. :)
I use M$-Windoze as the standard desktop for most business applications, with UNIX-based SQL servers, web servers, and email servers, in general. Just my preference.
I wouldn't expect a free OS in a constant state of change to replace commercially supported operating systems; they each have their purposes. Some people want access to the source code, and some people want 24x7 on site support. Yes, there's great support available for Linux and BSD on the 'net. That's not at issue. Some business models need a vendor out there that can furnish a maintenance contract and uphold it.
Maybe Aunt Ethel is into kernel tuning. ;)
I agree with you to a point; UNIX has not had an idiot-proof "stick the disk in the drive and type setup" capability until recently. UNIX apps are fewer in variety, and cost nmore than their M$-D0S/Windoze counterparts. Partly because anyone who wanted to develop could do so on an affordable D0S system.
If the free SCO offering is the old Novell Pers. Ed. (I don't know, just venturing a guess), Aunt Ethel just might be able to install it (your Aunt Ethel - mine's a kernel hack). As I recall, it came w/ a GUI installation routine.

Freedom of speech is a poor excuse for junk email. There are few absolute

more and more laws because someone is trying to make a buck any way he

Hitting the DELETE key once in a while is not the problem. Inequitable division of the costs is a problem. The aggravation of seeing something good being slowly eroded is a problem. People who feel that they have "rights" and "freedoms" with no concept of the social responsibility that creates and protects such intangibles are a problem.

Telemarketing (even at at dinner time) is widespread. So is junk snail-mail. How socialy acceptable these behaviors are is debatable.

It was sarcasm. I don't hope to enforce it. And I don't have a sig-line.
Comment is one thing. Mass junk mail is another. I'd view "comment" as expressing an opinion. If I put an "email to:" tag on a web site, I'm inviting "comment" on the information I've placed in public view - there's reasonable expectation that the "comment" will be pertinent, even if it is only "Your automated gif sucks." This isn't quite the same as inviting completely irrelevent junk mail, and I still fail to see how you make this leap of logic.
You are on a public mailing list, aren't you? You have some degree of expectation as to the pertinence of topics discussed on said list, don't you? Even if it is c'punks? The same holds true for newsgroups. The vast majority of 'net users dislike off-topic discussion; they subscribe to mailing lists and newsgroups to discuss topics of relevence and mutual interest. It is highly self-centered of you to assume the "right" to waste their time with unwanted and completely off-topic communication. 1a. Set up a robots.txt file. See  Polite robots will comply, though I doubt spammers building mailing lists will be 2a. Actively exercise YOUR freedom of speech to disuade spammers. Contact their ISP. Forward a complete copy of the spam; this lets the ISP see what's being sent where, and fills up their mail spool too. Most ISPs will decide that the spammer can take his/her business elsewhere.
Oh, so now I MUST remain anonymous, or I invite any and all correspondence regardless of relevence. Seems like your exercising of your rights is compromising mine.
Laws restrict freedom. They determine what we cannot do without fear of penalty. Some individuals exercise their "right" to freedom of action to the extent that they harm others. This causes those "others" to willingly/grudgingly give up some of their own freedom of action in exchange for protection.
When you exercise your "right" to free speech to the extent that you piss off a large segment of society, society will react by reducing its measure of freedom of speech. You have a right to speak your message, but you do not have the right to spray-paint it on the wall of my house. You may broadcast your message on the airwaves, but are subject to some restrictions. You once enjoyed the "right" to fax anything you wanted to send to my fax machine. Enough junk mail was sent to enough fax machines, and now many jurisdictions have another LAW restricting this behavior. I don't want to see legislation come to the 'net, but it will, and your attitude hastens it.
The long-term result of your abuse of your "right" to free speech is the invitation of government meddling into my right to free speech.

@_subject: "Unwanted Mail" 
Hormel, isn't it? Anyway, my point is that the law should not be involved
in it, but that it is going to be sucked in whether we like it or not if
social pressure is ineffective. What is, and is not "spam" has been
debated on usenet since the dawn of 'net time. While most newsgroup
members agree that traffic should stay more or less "on topic", few can
agree to just what "on topic" is. Sorta like the "Pornagraphy Definition"
of "I can't define it, but I know it when I see it" being entirely a matter
of one's own present and subjective opinion, and therefore impossible to codify. We're therefore stuck - as a community, we cannot stop what many people consider to be undesirable, as we cannot even define it, and the unwashed masses will set governance upon us for our "own good."
The community does try to prevent this undesirable sort of communication; many people will take it upon themselves to complain to the originator of the "mass mailing", and, if that fails, to the ISP providing connectivity. When the "mass mailing" is posted through a remailer, this becomes somewhat more difficult.
The ability to be anonymous on the 'net is generally a good thing. It has allowed people access to information that might have otherwise been denied them. It is an important freedom, and one that is already in danger of being taken away through legislation (Georgia on my mind ...). Abuse of this freedom by someone for purely commercial purposes is certainly not going to help matters.
Note the earlier comment about someone being unhappy about their "remailer-baby" being used for such a purpose - someone running a remailer is generally doing so as a service, and is generally not compensated for the equipment, time, energy, and aggravation. A lot of remailers have shut down recently. Is this helping the cause of privacy and free speech?
I have no complaint against anyone voicing their opinion, and defend their right to do so. However, I don't agree that a different set of standards somehow applies to those who provide a means to contact the providor of web content as a courtesy to their readers. Why does it fall to them to provide a completely off-topic forum for someone else's views? How are they any different from members of a public mailing list? Must the members of c'punks and toad.com accept all unpaid advertising in the name of free speech?
Sarcasm, Tim. I really wouldn't expect this to work, and doubt anyone else would. Just trying to point out that when all else fails, our society generally pursues resolution through the courts (could be worse, I suppose, but I for one think we are far too prone to this - OTOH, we seem to have slipped from "right" to "legally defensible" somewhere back Yes, it is meaningless, legally. It was not meant to be taken seriously, any more than the "dead skunks" were. Where the hell would I get 100 dead skunks at this time of the night?

Here comes more government infrastructure to enforce the LAWS that "we", as a society, have subjected ourselves to, so that "the few, the rude, the clueless" can no longer send out their anonymously sourced spam. Less freedom, more taxes. Why? Because someone out there is doing something because they "have the right", by the sole virtue of there currently being no law specifically against their particular behavior.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Your posting to cypherpunks was brought to my attention, and I wanted to
take a minute to respond.  (I also forwarded a copy of it to
"postmaster at juno.com", where we have a (small) staff of people to deal with
incidents like the one you ran into.  If you run into more in the future,
please e-mail the information to that address.) Since this is not directly
relevant to cypherpunks, I'm replying directly to you, but you are welcome
to forward this note to the list if you want.
A couple of clarifications: Juno has never sent a single piece of spam and,
as long as I have anything to say about it, never will.  We provide a free
e-mail service which is paid for by advertising, but the advertising takes
the form of graphical banners built into Juno's custom interface and the
ads only appear on the screens of Juno's members.  We have never sent any
ads by e-mail, and have never sent any online ads of any sort to anyone who
was not one of our members.
What's more, we expressly prohibit the use of Juno to transmit commercial
solicitations in the Service Agreement that all members have to accept before
they can create a Juno account.  When we hear about violations, we
investigate and (if it seems appropriate) take actions up to and including
terminating a violator's account on our service.  Needless to say, we do
not read or in any way screen the mail our members send or receive, so
until we hear about a spamming incident we have no way to prevent a
particular piece of spam from being transmitted; but I promise you we do
listen to the complaints we receive and act on them as quickly as we
responsibly can.  In short, we do not send spam, we do not tolerate spam,
and we will not allow our service to become a home to spammers.
Note that today we supply e-mail to more than 400,000 members, and over
6000 people create Juno accounts every day.  At this rate of growth, we can
expect to have millions of members by this time next year.  The vast
majority of our members use our service responsibly; it's only a fraction
of a fraction of one percent who send spam.  I appreciate your frustration
at dealing with these abusers of our service -- and believe me, they don't
frustrate you half as much as they do us -- but I ask that you not penalize
the hundreds of thousands of responsible Juno members (and those users of
your network who want to communicate with them) because of the actions of
the handful of miscreants doing their best to give us a bad name.  Juno has
no more (and, alas, no less) spam-producing potential or control over the
spam its members send than Netcom, AOL, CompuServe, or any other e-mail
provider.  (We're slightly better, perhaps, because Juno currently offers
its members no tools for direct posting to newsgroups or information about
mail->news gateways, and slightly worse because it is possible to get a
Juno account without having to give us a credit card number.)
By shutting off access to your network by our members' mail you hurt the
spammers only minimally -- they'll find another address elsewhere and spam
again, I'm afraid -- but may hurt Juno quite a lot.  And since we're the
only major provider of free e-mail in the country today, I'd hate to see
the service needlessly or inappropriately hurt.  (I also have personal
reasons, of course, for not wanting to see Juno hurt.)
I apologize for the length of this message, and if we have been
unresponsive to your past complaints I apologize for that as well.
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me directly.
Best regards,
Charles Ardai

Easily. What percentage of, er, mass internet advertisers would know that this site exists? I assume it would become a very large list, and would make a very atractive target for someone who wanted to provide email addresses to others for a fee.  btw - my girlfriend just wandered by, and read this over my shoulder. She's the network operations center mgr. for a large ISP. She just got a complaint last night from a, er, Internet Direct Mail Marketer, who claimed that his outbound mail queue was filling up, and this was somehow the ISP's fault that he couldn't reach certain addresses on a list he had recently purchased. Sorta like calling the phone company and complaining that some numbers on a telemarketing list were disconnected, or that nobody answered :)
I'd say it's a safe bet that the unscrupulous could easily sell a large, up-to-date list of email addresses of people who DON'T want junk email to people who want to send such mail.

Don't get me wrong - I'm not disagreeing with you about how grim your

generally interested in statistical data, such as the incidence of cancer
per zip code, etc., which doesn't require your name to be released. Zip
codes are sufficiently populated that this probably is of no danger to
privacy. OTOH, the potential for mis-use of such records is high, and allowing access to a huge number of commercial sites, and their employees, certainly opens a lot of holes.

I think it is more likely an us-vs.-them mentality, rather than the cost of educating the person in question. If someone much poorer than you is killed in a poor neighborhood, you don't feel as threatened - it is one of "them" - If someone of equal or greater socio-economic background suffers a violent death, you begin to think "it could happen to me, too." Now it is a matter of "us." The higher up the scale you go, the more people on the "us" side of the coin, with more money/political clout as well. This increases the demand to apprehend the killer, which increases the risk to the killer, hence, a higher price for a hit on a target in a higher socio-economic position.
It is not unusual for the investigation of drug-related murders to be lax; the "tax-paying" majority often says "let them bump each other off." With lax enforcement, lack of public outcry, there's less risk. The price is lower. Now if it is the lawyer that lives just down the street ...

This is probably somewhat system dependant, but I'm guessing that any lock on the file "could" generate the message that the account is "in use."
Could be a lock which was not cleared from a previous session, a backup system that wants exclusive reads on the files, etc., not necessarily another POP3 session. As for the sysadmin side, yes, there are other, easier methods of getting at the mail file. OTOH, could be someone inside an ISP (or not), who does not have access to the file structure, but did somehow obtain passwords through other means. Any ISP of any size will have different levels of access for different employees, and the graveyard helpdesk shift can get fairly dull ...
It is more than likely a system-related problem with a file lock, though.
I'd suggest changing your password, and making sure that you don't use a dictionary word or obvious permutation thereof. If you continue to have problems, check with the ISP about your "technical difficulties", and see what they come up with.

Perhaps "high school" should end at age 16, with two years of publicly
funded "junior college" or "technical school" available to those who
select one or the other, and qualify. This would bring an adult-level
decision earlier in life, and students would need to start thinking about
which path to chose at about 14. Perhaps this would allow reality to set
in at an earlier age. A high school diploma has become meaningless anyway - it is viewed as a "right."   This wouldn't leave anyone condemned to a life of menial labor for a
decision made at age 16 - there are plenty of successful people who have
obtained a G.E.D. later in life, and then gone on to college. It would, however, give some measure of responsibility to the near-adult.
In my own education, I found that I was getting nothing out of high school
by age 16. I wanted to drop out of high school to start college, but my
parents wouldn't hear of it. I got into an internship-for-credit program
instead, and got out w/ diploma and started college a semester later. My
fiance did drop out of high school at age 16 and started college, with her
parent's blessing. All her high school guidence counselor could come up with was "But she'll miss her prom"! It seemed that the last two years of high school were devoted to trying to drag marginal, apathetic students towards their diploma, kicking and screaming. Anyone "college bound" was just marking time.
I wouldn't want my children subjected to this - I'd rather they got into college as soon as they were ready, diploma or not.

Sprint's network was somewhat overloaded due to the bogus routes
redirecting traffic onto their network. I doubt the problem spread as far
as Europe, at least on a widespread basis. We have about 200 sites
worldwide, only a few actually connected to Sprint. We only saw
intermittent failures reaching some sites for about an hour. The problem occured at about 11:30 a.m. EDT, when the routers in question began sending invalid paths. The routers were shutdown at 12:15. Re-convergence might have taken another 20 mins. or so.
FLX. ASN 7007.
The Sprint router took in 72,000 bogus routes from the downstream source before it crapped out. A lot of traffic ended up being re-directed to Sprint as a result of the route problem, causing them to haul higher than normal levels of traffic.
Sprint probably should have been filtering routes / AS_PATH (insert debate
here) from its downstreams. This is a management challenge, but Bad
Things(tm) can happen if you don't. Why are you picking on Cisco? The equipment in question was a pair of Bay
Networks BLN routers. The jury is still out as to whether this was a Bay

Things looked fairly stable Saturday, from my perspective. I'll sniff around.
Routing loops do sound suspicious. Where were they cropping up?
No, just ignored it.  :)
Actually, there is a lot of change going on right now affecting network
topology; many ortganizations are migrating away from the basics and are
implementing packet shredders ^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^ ATM, higher speed circuits
than they are accustomed to, running alpha code on production routers out
of necessity (perceived or otherwise), etc. Very hard to "certify"  that
type of environment, but the exponential growth rate of the 'net has
required (or resulted in) some drastic actions. It's the "and contractors" that is the catch-all here. That includes damn
near everybody these days. Also - the voice system is still primarily a
connection-switched network, not a packet-switched network. Different
animal. Even so, a certain well known long distance providor managed to
bring down local calling across most of the east coast 4 or 5 years ago,
as a result of a software upgrade that didn't. So much damage? There have been far more severe Internet outages. There have been far more severe voice network outages, and for far greater duration. Amtrak managed to backhoe a major fiber trunk a while back, and nailed both voice and data services in the mid-atlantic region rather severely, not all that long ago. Friday was a fairly isolated and short term problem, unless you were working at Sprint.
As far as engineering solutions go, the route filtering vs. AS_PATH debate
has been going on for a while.  Recent events should add a bit of fuel.  But politicians, when faced with the same
True. But it is hard to legislate competence. Perhaps we could start with Congress as an experiment.
Like NIPRnet, which was only about 20% functional for most of a day only a few weeks back as a result of ATM switch failures?
The Internet is growing far too rapidly to be 100% dependable, at the moment, and no measure of legislation will fix this, certainly not in the short run. If Uncle Sam needs a reliable, fault-tolerant network, he should fix NIPRnet. If he can figure out how to do that (doubtful), maybe he'll have a qual when talking about the big picture.

It's difficult and expensive to build semi-autos that lock as well as a bolt action. As Tim pointed out earlier, for this type of shooting, sight-picture recovery generally outweighs the time it takes to operate the action, anyway. Also - if you are talking about counter-sniper work, the less shots you take, the less a target you make of yourself; taking between 0 and 1 shot is the recommended approach. :)
If you can see the sniper, he's not doing his job very well. You seem to be confusing the "cover men" trailing the entry team with "snipers."
Since "most" LEA SWAT units operate in urban areas, their snipers are probably within 100 yards of the target. An AR-15 easily accurate enough at that range (even without a scope, although 4x-6x works well at that range). Most would likely use a bolt-action, though.
Most of the higher-end bolt-actions will shoot tighter than the average user can hold them (without resorting to sandbags and a lot of time to set up their shot).

Accuracy will depend on the quality of the original being scanned, as well as the capability of the OCR system; flat originals scan much better than the "bent open" pages of a book or magazine, heavy stock tends to let less "bleed" through from the reverse side, fonts with extreme kerning are more difficult, point size is a factor, etc.
I've seen 97%+ w/ Calera, (about 2 years ago) when using flat, first
generation high quality photocopies w/ minimal skew and courier or similar
typeface. OTOH, the same system did not scan well at all w/ badly skewed
photocopies (caused by the "bend" induced by the binding of the original).
If you are scanning medical journals, take a look at your originals and
also at where the errors are occuring. You can also use a spell checker (after building up a suitable dictionary for your application) to cut out some of the error.
I'd guess your results to be less satisfactory for other applications where extreme accuracy is a must. "3", "8", and "B" for example, are often confused; not a big problem w/ a medical journal, but plays havoc w/ code, accouting data, etc.

It is only available in a handful of cities outside the DC metro area (they list NYC as being added "early 1997", and L.A., CHI, and others aren't even mentioned), but there's definately a market in the making.
The cost is competetive to non-digital rates, but the geographic limitations are currently quite restrictive, and range appears to be limited.

Since the criminal will no doubt be aware of this tactic, they'll be in the position of determining if the victim is lying about their lack of assets, or is using the security code. Will they be willing to risk murder against the possibility that the victim can be persuaded to give up the "real" number when other options are available? Possible, yes, but the average petty street criminal is looking for an easier mark.

No, you die on your 30th birthday, when you ride the carrousel.
The insurance plan would only work if there was a significantly less than one-in-a-million chance of having the disease. Otherwise, the cost will be more than one dollar. The rates would be lower if you buy your policy well in advance, since the disease never strikes before you are 30 - there's money to be made on holding your premium, and you jsut might die of something else before requiring treatment.
As Tim pointed out, however, if you can be tested prior to obtaining the
insurance, without admitting to it, you would not obtain the insurance
unless the test showed that you had the disease. The price of the policy
would therefore be $1,000,000 or so, with minor adjustments.

@_subject: Further costs of war 
Chuckle. The "war" of 1812 was nearly as much of an internal political struggle over the form the U.S. gov't was to take as was the "civil war."
"State's rights" were a key issue, with most of New England strongly opposed to the "war", which was causing New Englanders severe economic loss to to blockades which prevented their trade with England (the enemy).
Many did not wish to add additional states beyond the origianl seaboard 13, which would have doomed the new nation to being a British dependant.
There was great debate over the form a representative government was to take, with some supporting the idea that the "common" man was too ignorant to perceive long-term issues; some wanted a "house of lords" and "house of commons" as in England, with membership to the "upper" house, the Senate, restricted to an Elitist class. The Monarchists still had a great deal of support in parts of the original thirteen states.
The western states, such as Tennessee, were more in favor of supporting a combined "Federal" action against Britain than were the seaboard colonies, as the British were arming the local Indian tribes and inciting uprisings in an effort to block westward expansion. Folks in Tennessee wanted Madison to invade Canada to choke off the supply route.
French-speaking New Orleans didn't much care for having been sold to a foreign power, and had closer ties to Spanish Florida than to its new masters in Washington. Andrew Jackson's army did not receive a very warm welcome when he came to "defend" the city form the British; he had difficulty obtaining supplies, and had to declare martial law to maintain control of the city.
The trade issues and the "kidnapping" of American merchant seamen are given as "official" reasons for the conflict, but there were many other reasons as well.
Without the War of 1812, the "United States" as a single entity may never have emerged, and a loose coalition of states may have remained in its place, probably as a British dependant. Britian would have likely succeeded in regulating western movement, at least in the northern part of North America, and we'd all be talking like Phil.
The War of 1812 had arguably as great an impact on the Federal vs. States issue as did the Civil War. Interesting to see you "justifiying" this. :)

Based on what I've seen so far, the account numbers were more likely to have been obtained from the databases of merchants than from banks. If the bank was cracked, there would have been many more card numbers from one bank on the CD, rather than a distribution of account numbers issued by many institutions. I doubt that someone managed to crack a dozens of banks, and then took only a few thousand numbers from each. It is more likely that "widgets R us" was compromised, resulting in a few thousand accounts from each of the major banks.
I suppose I could look back over a few year's worth of statements, and tell you where *not* to shop, but I'd be listing all merchants I'd done business with as being equally guilty, when it is very likely that only one was compromised.

This is how it works in a free-market economy (doh!).
One of the self-appointed/assumed functions of gubbmint is to "fix" this, by granting some organization a monopoly in return for bearing the costs of creating infrastructure, as well as spreading the cost of servicing a (smaller) number of remote customers across a (larger) number of non-remote customers.
Whether this is a good thing(tm) or a bad thing(tm) depends, as usual, on which side of the subsidy you are on.
I would argue that such monopolies are desirable, and that their creation is a proper function of a responsible government. When the monopoly is no longer necessary (sufficient economy of scale has been reached to permit a competitive market to adequately service the customer base), then deregulation can occur.
I'm sure some on this list will argue this with me from their mountain cabins in bf-nowhere, but without such monopolies, they'd be sending smoke signals rather than paying $10,000 to get a phone line installed to their home. If you doubt this, look at the heavy reliance on wireless communications in third-world countries, and take a moment to consider how recently the consumer-wireless market arrived on the scene. Before you argue "the best government is no government", visit a few third-world capitols, and note how you move from a modern capitol city to flintstones-like living in about 50km.
A $.32 price on first-class mail to anywhere in the country is a good deal for all. OTOH, package delivery has become sufficiently competitive, and probably needs to be revamped.

Yes, it can be a bad thing no matter which side you are on. Many subsidies are merely re-allocation of wealth, often from the rich to the poor. OTOH, some services, although not essential, are important enough to warrant a limited, regulated monopoly until sufficent scale has been reached to allow a competetive marketplace to be successful.
Every organism seeks to propogate. It is the responsibility of the people to kill the monopoly when it has outlived its usefulness.
They do. What's your point? That this is unfair? Of course it is. Life is unfair. Some of these unfair subsidies by not be equitable in the short run, but in the long run, everybody comes out ahead. Others simply re-distribute wealth, to no long-term socialo benefit whatsoever. The difference between the two comes down to managing resources.
Some enterprises have traditionally been beyond the scale of the private sector, although that is really no longer the case. The US flourished due to the success of the railroad building in the late 1800's, and this success would not have been possible without a great deal of public assistance. True, the rich got richer, but in the long run, a more competitive marketplace evolved. The common person was, as a result, better off (at least from an economic perspective).
Eventually, the highway systems were government-subsidized, and the railroads were not. This helped GM and its shareholders to get rich, provided a lot of post-WWII manufacturing jobs, and created huge traffic problems and suburban sprawl. See post-WWII Los Angles as a The government provides flood insurance for those who continue to build in
flood plains, and those of us who live on high ground continue to
subsidize this. I live on high ground, and peronally feel that providing
flood insurance to an area that washes out every 5-10 years is stupid. OTOH, it might be useful to provide such insurance for areas that only
wash out every 40-50 years. Where do you draw the line?  BTW- The
government funds "water-control" projects as well, subsidizing the
delivery of water to rural areas. Distance is just another cost factor,
one that happens to be pertinent to the process of delivering packages. This was only partially due to frequency regulation. Miniturization has had a lot to do with the recent growth in wireless as well. Back when cellular phones were the size of a small purse, they were slow to catch on; people who spent a good deal of time in their cars, or those whose employers subsidised status symbols had car phones, but growth was still fairly slow. Once the hand-helds appeared, growth accelerated. There had to be enough consumers to support the cost of adding infrastructure, and there had to be enough infrastructure to support the consumer; some industries can pull this off without outside help, and some cannot.
BTW - Australian cattle stations used radios as their primary link to the outside world for quite a while, due to their rural location; the same held true for many other "remote" corners of the globe. Not a very scalable solution, though. Try using a CB in a built-up area. Then imagine everyone getting home on Thursday after a long day at work, and trying to order pizza delivery at the same time on a CB in that same area.
My point is that many areas of the world have not invested in deploying
technology very far beynd the boundaries of a few "modern" cities. Without getting into an even longer rant here, the end result is to
perpetuate the cycle of rural poverty (look into some of the studies of
third-world economic development - distribution of technology and services
is often cited as a critical success factor). Those who do escape to the
city and manage to attain a higher socio-economic status remain there. The
bulk of those born to poverty have no hope of climbing out of it. In many countries, (including Mexico, since you mentioned it), delivering
telephone service to rural areas without wireless technology was not even
possible; the locals pull down the telephone (and power) wires to steal
the copper for re-sale. Basically, some groups just haven't managed to pull off effective self-government; in the long run, you get the form of government you deserve.
If you are too damn self-interested to see anything in terms of the common good, you'll probably end up with a self-interested government. Call it corrupt if you wish to, for it is, but don't confuse cause and I'm not sure where you've been, but not everybody who lives in a rural area is wealthy; this only occurs in places where space is at a premium, and only the wealthy can afford to purchase space. There are plenty of rural people who are dependant on first class postage to pay their bills, and they can't simply walk over to the corner grocer/food stamp launderer/check cashing/utlity bill collector to take care of business the way they can down on da block.
At twice that, it is still a bargain, when you consider what you're getting for your money.
Actually, a good portion of the costs of first class delivery are subsidized by commercial bulk mailers, who are in turn supported by those who purchase goods and services found in direct mail advertisements. I suppose that you could even draw the conclusion that if one can afford to purchase goods, one is better off that one who cannot, and therefore the "haves", by subsidizing bulk mail, are bearing a share of the cost of first class delivery used by the "have nots."
Of course, we could argue economics for months - if you don't like the results, just change the assumptions.

but I don't have the metric conversions for this - you're on your own
there, and this won't really live up to expectations if you use metric conversion, anyway ...)
Carefully sift a pound of household flour, gradually combining with 1/2
teaspoon sodium chloride. Be sure that the mixture is uniform, without
clumping.  Aerate until smooth (in a non-reactive vessel, such as a PYREX
bowl) a pound of emulsified milk fat, and gradually add 1 pound of
granulated sucrose (available at the grocer's). Add the yolks from 10
eggs. Use a hand mixer to mix this, and get the mixture as "LITE" as
possible. Sift the sifted flour/sodium chloride mixture in very slowly -
MAKE SURE TO KEEP THE MIXTURE UNIFORM, AND DON'T ALLOW "LUMPS" TO FORM -
IF YOU BEGIN TO SEE THIS, SLOW DOWN THE RATE AT WHICH YOU ARE ADDING THE
BASE flour/Sodium Chloride MIX, AND STIR BETTER! Stir in a teaspoon of
extract of vanilla (CAUTION, THIS CONTAINS ALCOHOL, WHICH IS FLAMMABLE!)
and make sure to distribute evenly throughout the mixture. Add a 1/2
teaspoon of Citric Acid in an aqueous solution. Carefully add the egg
whites, distributing evenly.  Continue to stir this mixture until it
starts to become stiff and hard to stir, but TAKE CARE THAT IT DOES NOT
BEGIN TO BECOME DRY (stop mixing before it reaches this point!).  Use
butter or shortening to grease the inside of two bread loaf pans SO THAT
THE MIXTURE DOES NOT STICK TO THE SIDES OF THE METAL PANS.  Pour half of
the mixture SLOWLY into each pan. Use an oven to "bake" this mixture - let
the oven heat up to 300 degrees (farenheit), then put the pans in. You
will need about 1.25 hours for the heat conversion to occur. Be sure NOT
TO LEAVE THE PANS IN TOO LONG!!! If you see that the mixture is taking on
a "DRY" LOOK, or is "SHRINKING" AWAY FROM THE SIDES OF THE PAN, CAREFULLY
REMOVE AT ONCE!! MAKE SURE TO HANDLE THE PANS WITH PROTECTIVE GLOVES, AS
THEY WILL BE HOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO DROP THIS ON THE FLOOR AT THIS POINT!
Carefully set the pans down (slowly) where the heat from the pans will not
cause damage, and where the pans can be LEFT UNDISTURBED for several
hours. Allow the mixture to cool until the sides and the bottom of the pan
are cool to the touch - at this moint, the mixture will be safe to handle. This should make enough to fill several pipes, depending on size. Be very careful when packing the mixture into the pipe, and make sure that you don't get any of the mixture into the pipe threads, as this can get very messy.

Would you care to explain where? There's a big difference between a "flourishing" market for custom,
in-house-only software (especially in a language that is not high on the
list for US developers), and a commercial software market consisting of
widely distributed applications. The in-house stuff doesn't need copyright
protection; it's never allowed out, and even if it were, what are the odds
it could be used by others without access to source code?  Custom software
is more a matter of selling a service than a "product", and it's a lot
harder to "bootleg" services. What software products can you come up with that have the same level of market penetration as those engineered in the US or Canada? How many of those are from nations that do not honor copyright?
That's because the primary product is the image built by advertising, not the scent which is often fairly accurately duplicated (not that I'd know - my favorite scent is hallertau).

Actually the qustion is probably hosed, as the ratio should be 1:1
Hcl:NaOH mol, not weight (which would be about 10:9 Hcl:NaOH or so if I'm
not confused here) ...  the idea being that if you calculate and measure
just right, you can mix too highly dangerous chemicals and will get
saltwater which you can drink. If you don't measure just right, and drink
it, you are rightly fucked, so don't try this at home. Can't find exact delta-h listed for NaOH, but rough guess on this reaction
is maybe 150,000 - 175,000 joules, or about half a box of kitchen matches
worth of heat (~150-175 btu ?), which wouldn't boil a quart of water. I
suppose if you had a small enough solution you could get a small "bang"
out of vaporizing the water. Not exactly a terrorist threat.
A moderate amount of heat, but without increasing the number of molecules, where's the explosion? Am I missing something? Looks like warm saltwater to me. OTOH, I don't know anything about chemistry 'cuz I always got kicked outa class for doing dumber things than mixing Hcl and NaOH and drinking it, which is the usual stunt. Don't try this at home, and don't take chemistry advice from marsupials.

Since you didn't specify the method of access. it is hard to determine if
this is a large security hole. Most equipment can be rebooted and brought
up without a password IF you have local access. For example, Cisco routers
can be brought up without password simply by specifying the starting
address of the load file, but you have to be at the local console to do
this. UNIX systems can be brought up w/o password in single-user mode, if you have local access. Yes, there are firmware passwords to guard against this on many systems, but one can always swap up the eeprom, etc.

What part of Petro's response did you fail to understand? THe "elder Kennedy" is not on trail. A grand jury is convened to determine if enough evidence exists to bring trail. Those brought before a grand jury are almost always witnesses, or potential witnesses, as is the elder Kennedy.
A grand jury hearing and a criminal trail are two completely seperate processes. All the grand jury can do is determine whether or not to indite, whereupon the accused has the right to a fair trail before a jury as you state.
Anyway, the injustice in this matter is that the two most likely suspects, who were both dating the victim up to her death, have never been brought to trial. Just another abuse by america's "royal family."
The murder weapon was a golf club belonging to, as I recall, the father of one of the boys. Both boys were seen with her on the night of her death. No trial for over twenty years, plenty of expensive legal manuvering to prevent one. And now Jim complaining that a single judge is insufficient to determine if an inditement should be handed down.
Perhaps prof. Froomkin is reading the list and can pass on an informed legal opinion? I've never seen any regulations baring a judge from serving in the capacity of a grand jury, OTOH, IANAL.

It is possible that you are both right, to some extent. Shakespeare has
often been accused of borrowing other's works, but the practice was quite
common in his day. If one author could not pull off a successful
presentation of a story line, another would often pick up the idea, refine
it, and present the concept in a somewhat different light. There were no
copyrights in those days. (it was also hard to come by an entire script - these were jealously guarded to discourage plagirism - if a play was "copied", it was more often from memory of a performance, or from the recollection of actors than from the actual script itself)
There were also two distinct forms of theatre; the small indoor
presentations (such as were presented to the royal court) were highbrow,
while the outdoor theatres were sustained by the commoners and varied from the serious to the bawdy (or downright vulgar -  the outdoor
theatres were not well received in some social circles, either). It is
entirely possible that a play that failed to gain acceptance, or even an
audience, at a more prestigeous indoor theatre was re-worked by another
author for the Theatre, or even the Curtain (a rowdy playhouse that often doubled as a bear pit). Shakespeare may very well have picked up the central theme for one(or more) of his works from an obscure indoor play, possibly written by a courtier; that doesn't diminish his genius.

Most defendants are guilty. That doesn't mean the one in front of you is. Take traffic court as an example. How many defandants are there because
they are innocent, and the cop was mistaken, didn't calibrate his radar,
needed to fill his quota, etc.? A few. How many are there because they
want a couple points knocked off the penalty, even theough they were

People have come to understand and accept fingerprinting (although it was not accpeted initially). Many seem to be unwilling to trust DNA evidence, One can always request a judge to hear the case.
It isn't a perfect system, but what do you propose as an alternative? Should Tim May judge us all? Should we revert to anarchy, with whomever is left standing is considered innocent, and the dead are the guilty?
