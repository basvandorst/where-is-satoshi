SCOOPS AND TOP STORIES
IBM PLAYS DOCTOR
Big Blue is developing an innovative Internet "immune system" that intends
to do battle with one of the Internet's nastiest hazards - viruses.
   NET BOOM ELUDES MAIN STREET
We've all heard the seductive hum of the buzzwords: e-commerce, online
advertising, new economic paradigm, secure commerce. And yet, many of those
who actually put their sites where their mouths are seem to find one sound
to be conspicuously absent: the happy cha-ching of the digital cash register.
   BATTLES WITH GATES...PRICING SNAFUS...HUGE QUARTERLY LOSS? NO PROBLEM FOR AOL!
A mere six weeks after a white-knuckled corporate bungee jump during which
its stock plummeted to the 22-3/8 mark--AOL's stock rose more than 13
percent in a single day. A major factor in this comeback is the "big news"
(300,000 subscribers' worth) expected to be announced at the firm's
semiannual partners' conference tomorrow.
   DEC AND CARRERA TEAM UP TO CREATE 500-MHz WORKSTATIONS AND SERVERS
Aiming at Internet, scientific, and multimedia markets with their insatiable
appetites for processing power, the DEC/Carrera team can boast about
offering one of the fastest processors in the world. That is, until 1997,
when the race gets even faster.

SCOOPS AND TOP STORIES
JANUARY TRADING OFTEN A MICROCOSM OF THE YEAR TO COME
For 40 of the last 45 years, all bear markets began or continued
with losing or below-average Januarys, while the best market years
all had above-average Januarys. In today's Perspectives feature,
California Technology Stock Letter Editor Michael Murphy analyzes
what trends investors should look for during this bellwether
   IT'S JUST NOT AN ONLINE AD, IT'S A PURCHASE ORDER TOO
File under: "Oh, so THAT'S where all the money is going to come
from." Ted Leonsis of AOL predicts that a revolutionary breed of
transaction-enabled advertisements will bring billions of dollars
in ad revenues to the Net in the near future. He also opines that
these new hybrids will make today's "banners and buttons" obsolete
by 1998.
   CHASING GATES, ORACLE'S ELLISON FINDS SOMEONE CHASING HIM
Larry Ellison, who has portrayed himself as a Microsoft-slayer
with his vaunted vision of the Network Computer, is himself facing
a challenge, this time on Oracle's traditional home ground.
Informix's Phil White is hoping that his new product will make his
company the king of the database hill.
   SYBASE FINDS A SUGAR DADDY, AND THE MARKET RESPONDS
Although formerly number-two database maker Sybase has suffered
three consecutive quarterly losses, things might finally be
looking up for the troubled firm. The company's stock, which had
been virtually flat for more than a month, rose in response to the
news that renowned financier George Soros was bringing in the

SCOOPS AND TOP STORIES
GORE GETS AN EARFUL FROM CYBERMOGULS ON ENCRYPTION POLICY
Al Gore, the ultimate information highway cheerleader, won't like
what he sees in his in-box: stern criticism of the White House's
encryption policy. The Business Software Alliance's letter says
Bill and Al are heading in the "absolute wrong direction." But
giving is better than receiving (it is, after all, the holidays),
and the industry group offers five ways out of the morass.
   STEVE JOBS TELLS TECH CROWD, "IT'S THE CONTENT, STUPID!"
The man who helped launch the computer revolution of the 1980s is
now exhorting creative types to take their rightful place at the
digital table. Citing blockbuster films Toy Story, Jobs preached
that only the combination of technology AND creativity will get
the consumers' juices flowing.
   MICROSOFT'S BALLMER TAKES VERBAL DIGS AT NC HAPPY COMPETITORS
Perhaps you thought Microsoft was worried, or at least cranky,
about all the predictions Ellison and company have been making
about the network computer dethroning the PC as machine du jour?
Not at all. In fact, says Steve Ballmer, "it's fantastic!"

PUSH COMES TO SHOVE AS NETSCAPE LEADS TECH PARADE
As more and more people are pulled onto the Internet, more and more of the
Internet is being pushed back to people. This week at Comdex, a type of Web
publishing generically referred to as "push" technology received its most
significant endorsement to date with the introduction of Constellation, the
code name for a new technology from Netscape Communications. (November 21,
1996, 12:15 p.m. PT)
   COMPUSERVE GETS BACK TO BASICS
CompuServe's announcement today that it is closing down its flagging Wow
service by January 31 marks the end of the company's failed attempts to get
a foot in the door of the potentially lucrative consumer online service
business. "They're throwing in the towel in the consumer market," said Mark
Mooradian of Jupiter Communications. Instead, CompuServe, the second-largest
online service with 5 million users worldwide, plans to refocus itself on
its original mission: serving business customers. (November 21, 1996, 1:15
p.m. PT)
   POWERPC NOT OVERSHADOWED AT COMDEX
While Microsoft Windows CE devices may have grabbed most of the attention at
Comdex, important developments in the Mac clone market surfaced, including
new PowerPC reference design platforms from Motorola and IBM and the debut
of a 533-MHz PowerPC prototype system using an Exponential processor.
Motorola this week revealed its Yellowknife PowerPC Platform Reference
Design motherboard that supports the PCI bus and 603e, 604, and 604e PowerPC
microprocessors at clock speeds of up to 240 MHz. (November 21, 1996, 12
p.m. PT)
   TREASURY AGAINST NET TAXES
In a report released today, the U.S. Treasury Department opposed new taxes
on electronic transactions via the Internet, saying income should be taxed
the same whether it comes through existing channels or electronic means. The
report, which makes no formal policy recommendations, also expresses concern
that the Internet may become a tax haven for those who use anonymous
electronic money that cannot be traced and therefore cannot be taxed.
(November 21, 1996, 11:30 a.m. PT)
   COMPAQ LOOKS BEYOND THE DESKTOP
Compaq has expanded its core desktop product lineup to include new efforts
such as NetPCs, network computers (NCs), portable PCs, and handheld devices.
Mike Winkler, the head of Compaq's PC products group, bared the company's
plans for NCs and laid out the future strategy for Windows CE devices in an
interview with CNET at Comdex. (November 21, 1996, 11:15 a.m. PT)
   WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO TODAY? HOME
Bill Gates must like Comdex. While other CEOs will fly in to deliver a
speech and fly back out the same day, the Microsoft captain has been in Las
Vegas for at least two days, maybe more. "I've seen him in the hotel bar; he
comes in and has a beer all by himself, and everyone's looking at him," said
one attendee. But like sightings of the Other King, rumors of Gates's
unattended wanderings are probably just that. (November 21, 12:09 a.m. PT)

Here are some of the hottest new products we found as we wandered the floor
of Fall Comdex. (November 21, 3:00 p.m. PT)

AOL TRIES TO PLAY "THE PRICE IS RIGHT" WITH CUSTOMERS
As if he didn't have enough to worry about--blackouts, churn, the growth of
the Web--Steve Case and friends are also wrangling with attorneys generals
in 17 states. The problem is AOL's new pricing policy, which can be summed
up as: "Unless you say 'no,' your rate goes from $9.95 to $19.95." At pixel
time (previously "press time"), the skirmishes were just beginning.
   MICROSOFT CATCHES UP TO ITS OWN BROWSER IN MACLAND
Explorer for Mac users rejoice! Your hybrid platform/browser choice has just
been significantly enhanced by the arrival of Microsoft's Java Virtual
Machine. Some of the Web's most bleeding-edge firms are now rushing to
embrace this new entrant into the market.
   GATES & GROVE PROVE GREAT MINDS THINK AND CLINK ALIKE
First his friend and business buddy Bill Gates misses, then frantically
swerves to catch, the opportunities of the exploding Internet market. Now
Intel chief Andy Grove seems to have jumped into an exploding market late
enough to possibly fall off. Ironically, the product at the center of this
battle is Windows CE, made by none other than Microsoft itself.
   IT PUTS THE WHOLE...WORLD...IN YOUR LAP
People will buy 190,000 of them this year and 4.1 million by 2000. They come
in 20 varieties and move four times faster than analog modem speeds. It fits
in your pocket, but can take you thousands of miles in seconds.
   DESPITE IPO MISHAPS, TECH FIRMS STILL GETTING VC $$$
You've heard about Wired canceling its IPO. Twice. You've heard that the
VC-money-for-neat-Net-ideas bubble has burst. You've heard about apocalyptic
traffic jams that could choke the Web. But to get the real story on how
investors and venture capitalists feel about Net-related firms nowadays, the
old adage of "follow the money" yields interesting results.

SCOOPS AND TOP STORIES
MOTHER OF ALL NOTEBOOKS TO BE SHOT OUT OF CANON
Here are some numbers that might keep ThinkPad and PowerBook vendors up late
at night: 200-MHz Pentium processor, 13.3-inch active-matrix display, 1.4GB
hard drive, 8X CD-ROM drive. These formidable figures apply to Canon's
3200FX notebook, appearing in December at a showroom near you. It should
thus become the highest-performance notebook on the market --but is it worth
the price?...
   THE WEB VERSION OF DRIVING YOUR CAR AT 325 MPH
Have you been impressed by Peak Technologies' Peak Net.Jet, whose creators
have dubbed it the "turbocharger for the Internet"? If so, keep an eye on
the horizon for Datalytics' Web accelerator, Blaze, which will supposedly
let users surf the Web up to five times faster than they do today. The
company claims that four key weapons in Blaze's arsenal give it the edge
over existing accelerators, not to mention a team of blue-chip bundling
   DEATH, WHERE IS THY...PING?(?)
Maybe you've never been pinged. Maybe you've never known the feeling of
being on the business end of a huge chunk of data that overwhelms and then
shuts down your machine. But if it DOES happen to you (as Karl Malden used
to say), what will you do? What WILL you do? StorageTek's Network Systems
Group claims it has the magic bullet that is a mere four lines long and
takes only seconds to download...
   "HONEY? COULD YOU ANSWER THE TOASTER?
I'M TALKING TO FRANK ON THE MICROWAVE..."
Even before the appearance of the much-awaited "information appliances" that
are supposed to help us live like the Jetsons, Mitsubishi Electric America
and Diba are trying to drive down their cost by as much as half using new
chip technology. Some of the miracle gadgets expected include set-top boxes
with email and Web access, Internet-enabled phones with touch-screen
interfaces, and a "tour guide" device with a CD-ROM and built-in camera that
visitors could use in self-guided tours of museums and exhibits. Oh, and
don't forget to ask for the exciting "Toast Waiting" feature...

   OH, SO THAT'S WHY O.J. HAS THAT BATTERED COPY OF NEUROMANCER...
As humorist Dave Barry might solemnly intone, "We are not making this up."
Yes, Virginia, hackers did indeed vandalize the O.J. Simpson civil trial
section of AOL's Court TV site. A user reported that when he clicked onto
the particular section, a screen popped up with the words, "This area is
under construction," and, "It's a PIC of OLAF." Such esoteric language puts
this one right up where with Dan Rather's surreal "Kenneth, what is the
frequency" episode...

THE LEGISLATION THAT LAUNCHED THOUSANDS OF CYBERSPACE RIBBONS
It's baaaack... The Supreme Court will decide tomorrow whether it should
review the CDA--the legislation cyberspace loves to hate--or simply put it
out to pasture. Swirling around inside this legal vortex are issues of free
speech, the definition of "obscene," and a potential $250,000 fine for
transgressors. Maybe CDA really stands for "Can't download anything..."

they had contracted a virus with the esoteric moniker "Virogen.asexual."
While the scare isn't in league with the benzene-in-the-Perrier snafu of a
few years back, there were still ruffled feathers that needed smoothing.

SCOOPS AND TOP STORIES
ONLINE RIVALS GATES AND CASE CIRCLE EACH OTHER
The online world has become a killing field. CompuServe pulls the plug on
its consumer-based Wow service; Prodigy, at the bottom of the heap,
transmogrifies Kafka-like into an ISP. Now, as the mighty Web threatens to
consume all in its path, these two cyberbehemoths engage in a struggle for
the whole enchilada.
   ATTENTION COMDEX SURVIVORS! NEED SOMEONE TO FEEL YUR PAYNNNE?
Okay, you've been through a lot, granted...but speaking out about your
Comdex trials and tribulations can help the all-important healing process
begin. So please, send us your war stories. We will publish the five best,
and the winners--picked on a totally subjective basis by our editorial
staff-- will get supercool CNET T-shirts. Send your tales to
suggestions at news.com, and include the words 'Comdex stories' in the subject
of your message. P.S. Don't forget to check out our comprehensive coverage
of the sublime and the ridiculous at Comdex '96.

Just when you AOLers thought it was safe to go back online, the possibility
of another service glitch rises up on the cyberhorizon. Starting on December
1, AOL's 7 million users have the option of switching to an all-you-can-eat
pricing offer; the resultant "usage surge" may cause service delays,
according to a recent AOL announcement. Wise users might consider getting
their heavy surfing done this long weekend, once that turkey-induced coma
sets in.
   INTEL'S MULTIMEDIA CHIP: MORE SUITABLE FOR FUN AND GAMES THAN BUSINESS
Intel's latest technological achievement, the MMX Pentium processor, would
certainly be ideal for running sophisticated business applications--that is,
if there WERE sophisticated business applications for it to run. At this

the executive suite. The $64,000 question: will developers build for this
flashy new kid on the block?
