Gmail's new e-mail sorting system divides mail into three categories by
default - "primary", "social", and "promotions". The user can train the
filter by dragging and dropping and by creating new categories.
A quick look at avaaz.org's SPF record shows that they are using
Sendgrid, I doubt they will be having difficulties with deliverability.

Sure, lets tell them to move their e-mail from Gmail....to where? To
another big mail provider (whats the point then?). Lavabit, Silent
Circle, Hushmail, Tormail? Nope. Self host their own e-mail? Hah. Most
people don't have the resources and/or the ability to do something like
that. There is also the matter of trust, why should I trust $MAILHOST over
What is the solution then?
I hope I got my point across.

The biggest problem being spam. We need to educate typical e-mail users
about e-mail hygiene and spam fighting.

E-mail hygiene:
- Using aliases for every company you deal with, or using recipient
  delimiters like "+" so it is easier to find out which company sold you
  out.
- Exercise more caution when handing out your "primary" address
- Avoid services that like to spam your addressbook (see: LinkedIn etc.)
Spam fighting:
- Using DNSBLs to cut down on the crap
- Training spamassassin's DB with ham and spam.
- Enact rate limiting policies so that a compromised account can only do
  limited amount of damage.

Someone who primarily uses webmail and big e-mail service providers.
Probably doesn't even /care/ about e-mail, e-mail isn't cool after all.

The Geo info feature in Firefox is an API provided so that *websites* can ask for location info in an easy and developer friendly way.
Firefox did not ask for location info, the website you were on did.

Same engine, I guess they didn't bother removing it. It does absolutely nothing in Thunderbird because nothing will ever ask for your location in Thunderbird.
