@_subject: Crypto Kong penetration. 
IMHO, this is pure grade A bullshit.  If you included PGP in MsMail, and
Eudora and pine and elm from the get go, everyone would use it.  Poeple
use what they have and few learn about what they could use.  PGP for the
masses has been a widely discussed topic here.
Unless you can convice the mailer makers to include Crypto Kong in the
mailers, you're not gonna get any mass adoption either.  Still it's likely
to be much less than PGP anyway since it's already been out for ages.
Still there are plenty of plugins for Eudora to do PGP mail, and those who
know about it and need it use it.  The rest, well, they don't know and
won't know until someone snoops their mail and they get a bug up their
asses to get privacy.
Regardless of how good your program, if you ignore the basic facts and
stick to "Crypto Kong has feature X,Y,Z which PGP lacks" you won't get
anywhere either.
Mind you I'm not comparing PGP, nor Crypto Kong on any feature or security
level, just basic human nature.  If you get Microsoft to incorporate it in
every copy of win 98 and Office, you can bet fuckloads of people will use
it.  If you can get all the ISP's out there that offer service and
software to include it, you can bet a lot of people will use it, etc.

@_subject: (eternity) Re: remailer resistancs to attack 
It could be done if the remailer software is rewritten.  When you send a
message, include instructions for the last remailer to write a message to
either usenet or a web page on the same net as the remailer with a sender
selected id.  Have these pooled and posted every day/week, etc...
If your mail bounces it you'll know by reading a page off a server, or a
message off usenet... i.e. for the last one in the chain
::Request bounce "xyzzy12345"
Dont post anything other than the bounce strings to the world.  (i.e.
don't post the intended recipient's name, etc...)

2)From: "Brandon Robinson" Since no one else seemed to respond to this, I guess I will...first off
M.D.T. stands for (Mobile Data Terminals), I got this posting off some
group I can't really remeber where from, but it is informative, and was
subject of a Feb, '97 "911Dispatcher Magazine" story. It should answer all
of your questions, I also have a list of some places where you can buy the
unit pre-made, or a kit to make your own. I have left the Source code out
on purpose as it is rather lengthy, if you want it I can send it to you. ----------------------- Begin quoted article ----------------------
Article: 44420 of alt.radio.scanner
Greetings one and all,
Have you ever lusted to decode Mobile Data Terminal (MDT)
tranmissions? Have you ever wanted to see the same NCIC and motor
vehicle information that law enforcement officers see? Have you ever
wanted to see what officers send to each other over "private" channels?
And all this with an interface you can build with only a few dollars
worth of parts from your local radio shack?
If so this posting might be your rendevous with destiny. The tail
end of this posting includes the source code of a program that decodes
and displays MDT messages. It stores roughly 30k of messages in a buffer
and then writes the whole buffer to a file called "data.dat" before
terminating. The program may be interrupted at any time by pressing any
key (don't use control-c) at which point it writes the partially filled
buffer to "data.dat". This program only works for systems built by
Motorola using the MDC4800 tranmission protocol. This accounts for a
large fraction of public service MDT systems as well other private
The existence of this program is ample evidence that Motorola has
misrepresented its MDT systems when it marketed them as a secure means
of communcications. The interested reader will soon discover that these
systems do not use any form of encryption. Security concerns instead
have been dealt with by using a code. "And what might this code be
called?" asks the reader. The code turns out to be plain ASCII. What
follows is a brief description of how the program and the MDC4800
protocol work. If you don't understand something go to your local
library and check out a telecommunications theory book.
1. The raw transmission rate is 4800 baud. The program's interrupt
service routine simply keeps track of the time between transitions. If
you're receiving a perfect signal this will be some multiple of 1/4800
seconds which would then give you how many bits were high or low. Since
this is not the best of all possible worlds the program instead does the
following: transitions are used to synchronize a bit clock. One only
samples whenever this clock is in the middle of the bit to produce the
raw data stream. This greatly reduces jitter effects.
2. Whenever a tranmitter keys up the MDC4800 protocol calls for bit
synchronization (a sequence of 1010101010101010....). In the program
this will result in receive bit clock synchronization. There is no need
to specifically look for the bit sync.
3. Look for frame synchronization in raw bit stream so that data
frames can be broken apart. Frame synchronization consists of a 40 bit
sequence : 0000011100001001001010100100010001101111. If this sequence is
detected (or 35 out of 40 bits match up in the program) the system is
idling and the next 112 bit data block is ignored by the program. If the
inverted frame sync is detected one immediately knows that 112 bit data
blocks will follow.
4. Receive the 112 bit data block and undo the bit interleave. This
means that one must reorder the bits in the following sequence : {0,16,
32,48,64,80,96,1,17,33,49,65,81,97,2,18,34,...} if the orignal sequence
were received as {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,...}.
5. Check the convolutional error correcting code and count the
number of errors. The error correcting code is rate 1/2 which means we
will be left with 56 data bytes. The encoder is constructed so that the
output consists of the original data bits interspersed with error
correcting code. The generating polynomial used is :
1 + X^-1 + X^-5 + X^-6
Whenever an error is detected a counter is incremented. An attempt is
made to correct some errors by finding the syndrome and looking for the
bogus bit.
6. Keep receiving 112 bit data blocks until either a new frame sync
is found or two consecutive data blocks have an unacceptably large
number of errors.
7. Each data block consists of six data bytes; the last 8 bits are
status bits that are simply ignored. The program shows the data in two
columns - hexadecimal and ASCII. This data is kept in a buffer and is
written to the file "data.dat" when the program terminates.
8. What the program doesn't do: As a further check on the data
there can be CRC checks. This varies from protocol to protocol so this
program does not implement the CRC checks. Nonetheless, it is a
relatively trivial matter to find the generating polynomial. The
addresses, block counts, and message ID numbers are also quite easy to
As you can see, there is no encryption. The bit interleave and the error
correcting coding are there solely to insure the integrity of the ASCII
data. Since any moron could have figured this stuff out from scratch one
could argue that MDTs do not use "...modulation parameters intentionally
witheld from the public". Therefore the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act may not prohibit receiving MDT tranmissions. However,
consult your attorney to make sure.
The total disregard for security will no doubt annoy countless
Motorola customers who were assured that their MDT systems were secure.
Since Federal law states that NCIC information must be encrypted your
local law enforcement agency might be forced to spend millions of
dollars to upgrade to a secure MDT system - much to the delight of
Motorola and its stockholders. Cynics might conclude that the release of
a program like this is timed to coincide with the market saturation of
existing MDT systems.
Also, this program is completely free and it had better stay that
way. What's to prevent you from adapting this into a kit and selling it
look at Motorola's patents sometime. You'll notice that this program
does things that are covered by a shitload of patents. So any attempt to
take financial advantage of this situtation will result in utter misery.
Please keep the following in mind: this program only works with the
first serial port (COM1). If your mouse or modem is there too bad. If
you don't like this rewrite the program.
