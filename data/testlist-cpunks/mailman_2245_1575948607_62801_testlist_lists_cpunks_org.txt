@_subject: New Tor distribution for testing: Tor Browser Bundle 
Recently I have been working on creating a distribution of Tor which
includes a pre-configured browser -- the Tor Browser Bundle. It is
intended for being run off an USB flash drive, but will probably also
be helpful to users who want an easy-to-setup packaging of Tor.
More information and download links can be found here:
 The bundle contains Firefox, Tor, Vidalia, Polipo and Torbutton. No
installation is needed (just unpack the contents). All the components
are automatically started by one double-click.
The bundle is new, and contains development versions of Tor, Vidalia
and Torbutton, so should be considered a testing release. I do hope it
will be useful, and I'd appreciate comments, suggestions, and bug
