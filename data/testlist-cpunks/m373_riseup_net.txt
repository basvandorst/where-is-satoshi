Some conspiracists conjectured this might have happened in the fatal,
fiery crash of the investigative journalist Michael Hastings in L.A.,
but without hard evidence it's the purview of the credulous prone to
conspiracy theories rather than an actual one (of which there are many).
Attacks had been publicly demonstrated by then. Such intrusions would be
hard to trace (especially without access to do the forensics). If it
hasn't happened yet, it will in the future. People will continue to use
smart cars as it's convenient and will be entrenched and socialized in
by the time hoi polloi would begin to appreciate the danger. The smart
car tech will also be collecting that much more info on users in the
vein of smartphones, Google, Facebook, Acxiom, and the lot.

It's not a matter of credulity in believing that authorities would carry
out such an assassination, the problem is asserting such an act without
direct evidence. As I said, and as insider Richard Clarke said, it would
be difficult to show.
"What has been revealed as a result of some research at universities is
that it's relatively easy to hack your way into the control system of a
car, and to do such things as cause acceleration when the driver doesn't
want acceleration, to throw on the brakes when the driver doesn't want
the brakes on, to launch an air bag,"
"in the case of Michael Hastings, what evidence is available publicly is
consistent with a car cyber attack. And the problem with that is you
can't prove it."
It's a conundrum uncovering such operations. If the US has not taken
such acts yet, it, and others, will do so. It's akin to the older
problem of knowing if someone was poisoned in a way to appear as a
natural malady. Intel agencies have long used such measures.

The NSA provides data to the FBI and DEA, among others. Although it was
known previously, this is part of what Snowden released with
corroborating documentation. That it hasn't gotten more attention, by
Greenwald, Snowden, et al, is one of the major credible complaints since
the releases began in June 2013. The FBI does do its own surveillance
and can easily tap telecoms with programs such as DCSNet and Red Hook,
but they don't have the resources (as far I know) to do the blanket
surveillance that NSA (and GCHQ, CSE, etc) does. NSA collects nearly all
internet traffic in the USA with its intercept rooms at the network
control centers that big telecoms have on the internet backbone. They
gather almost everything, including content, not just metadata. The
announced capacity of the Bluffton, Utah data center is several orders
of magnitude more than is needed to store metadata alone.
So, yes, some NSA data is shared with the FBI (and others) but the
details matter. There is FBI surveillance but NSA does the blanket
surveillance. With the FBI, as far as I know, you have to be targeted
(except for the IMSI catcher type stuff, which are indiscriminate but
not an nationwide/international dragnet). The AP story about the FBI
surveillance planes is quite interesting, although fits with recent info
and long term trends.

As others said, I made an oversight in that the FBI also provides some
info to the NSA. Info goes both ways. There are some restrictions on
using domestic intercepts, and this is where the FBI comes in. Using
businesses to do dirty work is also a way that the government
circumvents certain controls and accountability that don't apply to
companies. All major telecom companies have worked closely and secretly
with government spying since their inceptions. Both need each other. You
should also look into FBI's DITU in addition to DCSNet, Red Hook, and
such specific technologies.

@_subject: Dallas suspect killed by police robot 
They bombed him. This is the first incident in the US that I am aware of.
"10:20 a.m.
A robotics expert says Dallas police appear to be the first law
enforcement agency to use a robot to kill.
Peter W. Singer, of the New America Foundation, says the killing of a
suspect in Thursday night's fatal shooting of five police officers is
the first instance of which he's aware of a robot being used lethally by
Dallas Police Chief David Brown told reporters that after hours of
failed negotiations and in order to not put any officers in harm's way,
his department used a robot to deliver a bomb that killed the suspect.
Brown said they saw no other option.
Singer said in an email Friday that when he was researching his 2009
book "Wired for War" a U.S. soldier told him troops in Iraq sometimes
used MARCbot surveillance robots against insurgents."
