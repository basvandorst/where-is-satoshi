Dear Friends of Word [
      Two things:
      1.  Word has been nominated for 3 (three) of the 1996 Cool Site of the       Year Awards (Cool Site of the Year, Cool Design of the Year, and Cool       Web Designer of the Year).  Please vote for us.  We're literally       begging you.  Does this seem desperate?  Cool Site of the Year is       located at       2.  Please check out Word [  Right now you can       experience our special feature "Guyana," a super-deluxe documentary       about three NYC artists' (Bob Braine, Mark Dion, and Alexis Rockman)       six-week trek through the Amazon jungle.  It's got art, animation,       text, and an original score. Sort of like a movie. But not. Anyway,       it's real good. Mmmmm!
            Truly Yours,
            WORD
      3.  I know we said there would only be two things, but we just thought       we should mention that if you've requested to be removed from our       mailing list, it *will* happen very soon.  We've had a bit of trouble       keeping everything up to date.  Word swears to remove you from the       list.
