Yes, in the Permanent War on Some Dictators, we need permanent police  state measures.
Bush faces a tough decision: roll east, or roll west.
Since Syria is more decrepit in its armaments, as Iraq was, it will be  the likely target. But first we need to prepare by floating rumors that  Saddam's missing "WMD" (not found by the U.N., not found by the  swarming soldiers) must have been spirited out to Axis of Evil Founding  Member Syria.
The Permanent War helps the defense contractors, helps the Republicans,  and helps Israel.
What more can we ask? (Don't answer this unless you've checked with the  text of the Homeland Security Act and PATRIOT Act to see if your  answers make you an "illegal combatant.")

They claim to no longer need to prove that a person was planning a  terrorist act. They claim that merely having terrorist tools is enough.
There are several pending examples of this, discussed here. One guy up  in the Northwest is facing terrorism charges for possibly thinking  about possibly making ricin, possibly to poison his wife. No, I'm not  talking about Jim Bell. Here's a URL:
"Olsen would face life in prison if convicted of the federal charge of  possession of a biological agent or toxin for use as a weapon. "
A good thing Bell was not being charged during the Permanent War.
(Also a good time to get rid of those teflon-coated frying pans. P.S.  Don't do a Google search in this area, especially in the area of making  Sarin and other agents using home kitchen and garage ingredients unless  you are aware that Google has hired many former spooks to help  coordinate their very voluntary snooping and narcing on user searches.)

@_subject: One's first OS is always the best 
If there is any insinuation that this implies to _computer_ OSes, I disagree completely.
My first OS was some OS I don't remember from an HP 9825 computer. Too trivial to remember.
(Actually, I used various BASIC machines prior to this, from 1968-74, but they rarely had OS names that were memorable.)
Then RT-11 on a DEC PDP-11/34A. Then RSX-11M on the same machine.
Then some exposure in 1978-79 to Unix, courtesy of some of my friends who were active in the Unix community.
Then VMS for the VAX.
Then PC-DOS for the first IBM PC.
Then the LISP-based OS for the Symbolics LISP Machine. This was a wonderful OS.
Then the Mac OS, starting with Finder 1.0/Chooser 1.0 in 1984 (and proceeding to every version).
Occasional use of Windows 1.0 (horrible) in 1984, Windows 2.0 around 1986 (still unusable), and Windows 3.0/3.1 around 1990 (the first OS to catch up to where the Mac had been years earlier).
For the past couple of years I've had Mac OS X on all four of my Macs able to run it efficiently. It has bits and pieces of BSD Unix, a Mach kernel, and of course a wonderful graphics interface.
So, no, one's first OS is not always the best.

Yes, but our side was using these freedom-fighting tools because we were freedom-fighters, not terrorists.
When our side blew up the civilian Air Cubana airplane it was an act of freedom fighting, not terrorism.
When our side mined the harbor of Managua, Nicaragua it was an act of freedeom fighting, not terrorism. (The Nicaraguan citizens had held a democratic election and had elected Daniel Ortega, a socialist, not the right-wing drug industrialist we had favored. So we mined their harbor.)
When our side infiltrated Czechlos--whatever--vakia to burn hay lofts with the time delay system you describe, or to poison water supplies, or to sabotage factories, it was an act of freedom fighting to prove that the Czech system could not work. Sort of the CIA's version of "Unbearable Lightness of Being."
Remember, when we assassinate and mine and blow up airliners, it's all part of the freedom fighting techniques taught at the College of the Americas CIA campus.
(As a libertarian, and as one who read "1984" when I was 14 and "Atlas Shrugged" when I was 16, I am no friend of either socialism or communism, so don't misunderstand my comments above to mean that I support either Castro or the former USSR satellites, etc. But, befitting my exposure to "1984," I despise doublespeak and doublethink even more than I dislike Castro, for example. I favor freely trading with Cuba as the best way to implement "regime change" there. I believe locals need to change their regimes. If they won't, then they deserve what they get. There is great "moral hazard" involved in bailing out people or nations for their unwillingness to study, to learn, to defend themselves, etc. Apply this point to either American negroes and their degenerate status or to 1930s Eastern European Jews who were more intent on rocking and swaying and reading Torah scriptures than they were in preparing.)

BAGHDAD (Routers) -- A team of Coalition legislators, lawyers, prosecutors, and judges has been air-dropped into Firbol Square to take charge of Saddam's statue's head and to prepare Iraqi democracy for the post-liberation era.
Copies of the suggested model legislation were distributed to reporters outside the Tel Aviv Hotel (formerly the Palestine Hotel). Copies were made on French copiers looted from the Ministry of Information.
Some of the items in the model legislation include:
* passage of the "Iraqi PATRIOT Act." This Act would ban speech deemed harmful to the nation, would allow jailing of material witnesses and other illegal combatants without charges, would declare Islam to be a terror-related cult, and would basically be much more efficient that the primitive tools used by Saddam.
* establishment of a dual-party system and the lobbyists and graft collectors necessary to make such a system work. The names of the parties have not been finalized, but at least one of them will likely be called "The Republican Guard."
* a change in the name of the Ministry of Information to "Department of Homeland Security." It is suggested that the current Minister of Information, aka Baghdad Bob, be named Secretary of Homeland Security.
* restrictions on terrorist use of cryptography (in other words, use of cryptography by non-governmental bodies).
* a national ID system based on the system in use in Coalition countries
* an extensive system of surveillance cameras similar to the one deployed in the United Kingdom, a Coalition principal
* a recommendation that Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabia reporters face charges of sedition for illegally reporting events not intended to be reported
* strong new restrictions on pornography, smut, and hate speech
* a nationwide smoking ban

@_subject: "Stay Behind" strategies in Iraq 
I'll make another prediction/analysis: the widespread looting and chaos now being seen in Baghdad, Basra, and other large cities is completely Not just because people (peasants, unemployed, Shiia, etc.) see the chance to grab some television sets and microwave ovens. This component is understandable in the way the Rodney King riots were understandable.
No, the more interesting reasons are these, the second being the more 1. Iraq has been a welfare state for essentially its entire lifetime.  From the 1920s to the 1960s, a typical backwater royalist welfare state. Since the 1960s, a socialist/central planning/fascist state.
(Much like Israel, actually, but that's another discussion.)
Much of the population was dependent on stuff distributed by the central government, using oil revenue. Since the U.N. sanctions, this has been called "food for oil." The mechanics are well-known: oil is pumped, money goes to buying food and stuff, government distributes the stuff, with a limited amount of U.N. supervision. This has now stopped, of course. And since much of the population has no independent source of income, no factories producing stuff that the rest of the world wants to buy, the effects are obvious.
(Germany and Japan were in different situations: each had substantial armaments, vehicle, steel, etc. facilities. After being repaired, and perhaps after shifting for a while to making motorcycles and lawnmowers and such, these industries re-emerged and aided in the rebuilding. We all know their names: BMW, VW, Mitsubishi, Toyota, etc. Iraq has far fewer such industries, per capita. Offhand, even with their 30 million population, I cannot think of a single "Made in Iraq" item, from even before the 1990 events.)
They will be a handout state for the next 20 years, perhaps longer. There is little chance that investors will pay to rebuild their infrastructure, given the lack of ability of the peasants to pay.
And here's the more interesting, from our perspective, reason:
2. "Stay Behind" strategy. First some background.
A key component of U.S. and NATO plans to deal with a Soviet invasion of Western Europe was to absorb an initial military defeat, if such was inevitable, and then to have commandoes and sappers "melt into the population." Mao had used such a strategy many times in the 1940s and NATO planners were well aware of the effectiveness. The Vietnam experience added more support.
The French Resistance was notably less successful, but also had not been prepared in advance. (Still, were I a professional military analyst writing detailed reports on such resistance movements, this would be part of my "compare and contrast" set of cases. It's possible the Iraqi/Baathist resistance will be no more effective than the French Resistance was.)
There were various names for the "Stay Behind" plans, several of which emerged during the cases in Italy of right wing bombings and political scandals. (P2, Gladio, etc.) One URL is:
The Stay Behind strategy involved the obvious things: pre-positioning of armaments (RPGs, bazookas, C4, rifles, terrorist supplies) at hidden locations, false identity papers prepared by the best forgers (indeed, by governments themselves!), and training for just such "stay behind" The plan would be to let the Soviet invaders take control...then make it essentially impossible for them to keep control. Sabotage, both major (power plants, factories) and minor (snipping power lines when possible, sabotaging water pumps, all things a single person can do easily). Propaganda. Assassinations. Snipings. Etc.
(A friend of mine was actively involved in doing this in an Eastern European nation occupied by the Soviets. In modern parlance, he was a terrorist. But the Soviets eventually gave up and left.)
OK, what's the relevance to Iraq?
Saddam and his associates surely knew well of these strategies. If viewed over the long term, the cheering today as his statues are toppled is relatively minor if the U.S. is ultimately forced to withdraw  (for whatever reason) and the heirs to Saddam get back in Knowing a military defeat in open combat was inevitable (I said as much many weeks ago, that the military outcome was inevitable, though one could hope for an unfolding train wreck to dull American citizen-unit enthusiasm), and knowing that even the "fedayeen" commandoes would likely eventually fail, the "stay behind" strategy was probably a topic of much debate, and funding.
* Pre-positioned supplies. Not hard in a desert, where thousands of bunkers were built, where thousands of desert sites covered with sand and only knowable through GPS coordinates--the new treasure maps--are trivial to set up)
* Extensive foreign bank accounts, now available to hire suicide bombers (money going to their families, of course). They'll be vastly better-funded than the Palestinians are.
* Snipings, bombings, sabotage.
* Most importantly, as the infrastructure continues to be in sad shape and as 30 million continue to live essentially as beggars, resentment of the occupation force can only grow.
Yeah, a lot of Iraqis are waving U.S. flags and photos of Rambo (seriously) and saying "We love Bush," this is the enthusiasm of the moment. Wait until a few years have passed and they still haven't climbed out of the poverty of Liberty City (the slum formerly known as Saddam City). (Because a slum of a few million people has essentially nowhere in the world ever climbed out of poverty, even in well-developed countries with strong free market systems. At least not in the past several decades. Reasons left as an exercise.)
Meanwhile, there will be groups with access to the offshore accounts, to the buried supplies, who will have a very strong incentive to into power. Getting into power means control of the billions of barrels of Neighboring countries will find that it's to their advantage to keep the U.S. bogged-down in Iraq. The last thing Iran, Turkey, Syria, or even Saudi Arabia wants is a Westernized state in their midst, a base to launch other "liberations" from. So though they'll pay lip service to the idea of being happy Saddam is gone, they'll be sure to keep a trickle or even a river of terrorists and supplies heading into Iraq.
And so there are many reasons for a "stay behind" strategy and almost no reasons against it.
The perfection of their papers, and the necessity of the U.S. to deal with former Iraqi bureaucrats, means that many of the Iraqis the U.S. works with can very easily also be part of the underground, the resistance. Expect lots of double and even triple agents. A lot of Iraqis may seek to cover their bets by working both sides, just so they can later produce documents (encrypted, one assumes) proving their longstanding alliance to whichever side is dominant ten years from now.
So, as many analysts have said, the military victory of our Abrams tanks over their obsolete tanks was the easy part. A harder part will be the police force action of the next several months, and dealing with the American public's frustration with mounting costs, longer deployments of troops, and periodic bombings and snipings.
And then the really hard part takes over. A year from now, two years from now, and Baghdad resembles Beirut or Nablus, and 100,000 troops are still patrolling the streets.
And there is no boom in building semiconductor and television factories, as the optimists are expecting. And most of the nation is getting handouts from their new government, the U.S. puppet.
Yep, grounds for optimism. The poverty of the West Bank, except a factor of ten larger.

What part of "no _factories_ producing stuff" was unclear? (Emphasis added. Oil is not something skilled workers produce...it is something that a very few produce, leaving most dependent on only what trickles You clearly have not visited oil wells or refineries lately. Most of the drilling is done by specialized drilling companies, e.g., the French, German, British, Dutch, and U.S. drilling companies. They hire a small number of locals...probably they'll be hiring far fewer for upcoming projects, due to security measures.
Refineries are built by the Bechtels and Parsons and their European and Japanese counterparts. Most are nearly fully-automated. Again, a comparatively tiny number of locals will be hired.

And many of the existing facilities are _old_, as the hazards of the past 20 years have limited construction opportunities. The French and the Russians built some facilities.
A lot more would be needed.
As you cite, the profits from the oil output are already spoken for. Now, of course, the new regime in Iraq could simply repudiate its national debt and specific debts on specific refineries and pipelines and say "We're starting over, with contracts going to Exxon/Mobil, Halliburton, and Zapata Petroleum. Oh, and one to our British friends." Perhaps they should.
But even if they do, and even if, say, a couple of dollars a barrel get passed out on street corners in Saddam City, this won't change the underlying basket case nature of their economy.
Iraqi GNP per person was about $1500. This was before the latest war.
There is virtually no chance production will be ramped up (new wells drilled, new pipelines laid, new refineries built) fast enough to affect the 30 million Iraqis in any significant way.
Sometimes ya just got to say "Glad I don't live there!" and be done with it. Unfortunately, now we cannot just be done with it, as we're knee deep in the Big Muddy, and the big fool says to push on.

You're arguing for what you would like to see, whereas what I'm talking about is that there is unlikely to be any surge in employment in this hand-out nation.
Some small number of additional workers will be hired as some refineries and other facilities are expanded, repaired, etc. Perhaps even a few 7-11 franchise stores will open, employing perhaps 50 Iraqis.
There simply is no prospect that significantly more than the small fraction of Iraqis who now service the oil industry will be employed. Doubling oil production, which is essentially impossible, would only double a small number...or not quite double, as newer facilities will be even more automated.
Meanwhile, most of the nation's 20,000,000 will continue to rely on I said that no major ghetto/slum area, whether Calcutta or South-Central LA or Baghdad has ever, in memory, gone to nearly full employment. I'm a libertarian, not a do-gooder: I realize that more and more people are simply useless eaters. The useless eaters in Baghdad, Basra, etc. will
You're showing your statist/idealist roots. It's not a matter of "the US could keep the Iraqis poor." No more so than the U.S. is keeping the South-Central LA negroes poor, or the Calcutta natives poor.
Markets clear. As I said, even doubling the oil production in Iraq would have minimal effects on overall employment. This is an economic I suppose the U.S. could order Iraqi National Oil to hire tens of thousands of people to polish the pipes, wipe down the derricks, spoon up the spilled oil, and other make-work jobs. Still a drop in the Basically, Iraq went through a standard Turd World birth boom, doubling its population and then doubling it again in just a couple of generations. Look at the statistics on how many Iraqis are under 15.
They dispersed handouts to the breeders, who now number 20 million, crowded into several major cities and a dozen smaller cities.
Don't extrapolate from your own ignorance to others. I've seen several coal- and oil-fired power plants (in Virginia and California), and I drive past the Gaviota, CA refinery (where offshore oil platforms deliver to the site) and can see how few people work there. (It's about 30 miles west of Santa Barbara, on an isolated stretch of ranchlands.)
Modern refineries cannot afford to have people running around with wrenches and screwdrivers, tweaking and reading gauges. The plants either run with few people or they are doomed.
Finally, for now, a friend of mine for the past 28 years is the son of a former Chevron head of research and development (at the Bay Area refineries...also lightly staffed). This V.P., Dr. John Scott, told me many years ago just how few people it takes to run the crackers and distillation towers.
As for working oil wells, I've flown over vast oil fields in west Texas, and have driven past many oil derricks in California (in several regions). Unmanned. Small maintenance crews are all that are needed.
It's good for Iraq that they have oil. Having oil is always better than not having oil. But any notion that any expansion of the oil business is going to magically employ millions of Iraqis who are not now employed is silly. Do the math.
Silliness. Prices are set by markets. No one is claiming that Halliburton will get the bulk of the oil profits. But Halliburton will not do its thing (drilling services, extinguishing fires, etc.) except at prices they find acceptable.
You seem to have some kind of fantasy going on about Iraq's oil economy somehow giving jobs to millions of Iraqis who have no skills, no work experience. Optimism has blinded you. Do the math.
I've told you I've seen the Gaviota plant, and know from Dr. Scott just how few workers are inside refineries and pumping stations. It has to be this way.
"Redistributing the oil wealth" will not do anything except lead to a further doubling and tripling of the population.  The moral hazard of  handing out free stuff is itself enough to derail real markets.

Baghdad will be a basket case for decades to come...
The power vacuum as the old regime left, and as U.S. soldiers are staying out of any police action, has given widespread looting. Probably by a mix of the peasants grabbing everything they can, factional revenge, and even deliberate arson by "stay behind" forces.
Abu Dhabi t.v. is showing hundreds of scenes of small shops being looted. Shop-owners face financial devastation, as their stock is taken...they probably either have no insurance (their fault, of course), or war exclusions or loss of records as the buildings are burning will prevent any compensation.
No fire service, no water for fire-fighting.
It looks from the several satellite channels I am monitoring that more infrastructure/business damage is  happening as a result of the looting and arson than from the 1991 and 2003 bombing campaigns combined. And with no sign that it will stop until every business has been stripped bare and torched.
CNN reports that the national museums have been looted, with the Sumerian and Babylonian artifacts carted off by thousands of looters. One analyst said a lot of ancient artifacts will be appearing over the next several years in European art auctions. (In cases where the Sacred Bowl of Hammarabi is not being used as a cooking bowl by a family in Saddam City.)
The long-term implications are clear: Baghdad will not be much of a tourist attraction or regional cultural center for many years to come. This will of course worsen the basket case nature of Iraq and will probably result in the eventual (maybe sooner rather than later) return of a "strong man" regime.
And Americans will be expected to "rebuild" Baghdad.
Ain't gonna happen. Stealing our money to rebuild a country we bombed because we didn't like their leader is going to be further grounds for action against Washington, D.C.

Something like this.
When we smashed Germany and Japan, those nations didn't burn and loot every major building, store, factory, etc. There may have been several reasons for this. For example, we accepted the formal surrender of both nations, leaving their "management" in place for at least the transition period (more so in Japan than in Germany, for various This time around our government was so fixated on the eee-vils of Soddom (*) that we simply sought to destroy everything connected with the leadership...and they got the message and bugged-out, suddenly, perhaps well aware of the chaos it would throw the country and the capital into.

(More intelligent teams were apparently moved in once the looting started. I just got a communication that professional thieves from Cairo and Damascus were quick to realize the opportunities of plundering the national museums and private homes. The silver Harp of Ur alone is worth $4 million.)
This looting and collapse is a consequence of the sacking of Baghdad. Perhaps it's part of the plan. Burn off several million useless eaters and maybe there's a chance for a more compliant U.S. client state.

I'm not surprised to see some of my friends and associates (not necessarily on this list...I actually do interact with people off-list) switching sides from being "anti-war" to the other side. They natter about how Saddam was a tyrant (true enough, and there are a hundred other such tyrants), to how he must have had the magical word WMD (no evidence so far, and he certainly didn't use them when he should have), and how this will prove to the A-rabs that America stands tall I think of this as warporn. Seeing the tanks blowing up stuff, seeing the "embedded" reporters riding atop the Bradley fighting vehicles like Lawrence of Arabia, seeing what a trillion dollars of defense spending can put into the skies over Iraq...all a kind of warporn.
I was and am against the war for a very straightforward and principled reason: it is not a valid function of United States government to be the world's policemen, to be going around removing national figures we have decided we don't like. Whether it results in cheaper oil for Chevron (at the expense of one hundred billion dollars for the rest of us) is not a basis for starting a war.
(Oh, I forgot...Congress shall have the power to declare war....but they didn't. This is one of those "police actions" that are not actual legal wars. Maybe the vets should be denied the special pay and death benefits accruing in actual wars.)
The U.S. claimed Saddam was a monstrous threat, with a powerful army, with huge caches of "WMD." (Sounds like Israel. Sounds like India. Sounds like Pakistan. Sounds like us, the U.S.)
The U.N. inspectors were unable to find the supposed WMD. (The Al-Samoud missile being a pathetic example where the missile met the allowable range with a warhead mounted, but failed the allowable range without a warhead...so the U.S. decided the missile without a warhead was a "WMD" because it exceeded the b.s. allowable range by a handful of miles. Something out of a Saturday Night Live sketch.)
The U.N. was unable to find the supposed huge caches...and so far the swarming U.S. troops have failed to do so. Rummy keeps saying "We know they're there...we'll find them soon."
(This is about time for Rummy to tell the CIA to throw down the throw down gun.)
The Iraqi army was what it has always appeared to be: a Turd World primitive army based on graft and corruption and intimidation of non-officers by officer toadies. In other words, not a serious fighting force. And yet they were portrayed as threatening the world.
As Chomsky notes, the Big Lie has been hinted at in such a way that more than half the sheeple in the U.S. are now convinced that Saddam Hussein was behind 9/11.

Where's the surprise? Certainly none here. According to CNN, Iraq owes France at least $8 billion, owes Germany some similar amount, and so on. Some of these debts are for armaments, some for industrial products, etc.
Iraq's estimated debt is $200 billion. The CNN estimate for France ($8 B) is probably low.
The U.S. of course is calling for France and Germany to "forgive" the debts. (A complication is of course that some of these debts are not owed to the _nations_ of France and Germany but to corporations, partnerships, banks, and even individuals. Which makes it hard for France or Germany to wave a magic wand and erase the debts. Granted, Jacques Randome Frenchie may have a hard time collecting, but the principle is of course that debts are not absolved by mere changes in government leadership. (This matters because the international bodies can make it hard for payments to flow back to Iraq: they can "attach" payments and send them to the creditors who make claims. The U.S. can attempt to avert this by bypassing European banking networks, I suppose. But, fundamentally, the money is still owed and if the creditors do not forgive the debts (and I mean the creditors, not the nations of France and Germany), then assets can be attached, even oil tankers can be impounded.)
More interesting to me is the exodus of money and weaponry out of Iraq. Billions in gold bullion exiting the country. And into vaults and hidden places in Syria, Jordan, Iran, Turkey, and border areas of Iraq. Not only is there much evidence that the exodus of cash (dollars, not dinars) and bullion and valuable weapons began months ago, when war became inevitable, but it accelerated several weeks ago, just before the bombing began.
Not to mention the tens of billions already in thousands of bank accounts in Europe, Asia, the Caribbean, Panama, and other locations. Set up over the past 20 years, and deeply hidden. (One of Saddam's relatives, recently a diplomat in Switzerland, spent most of his professional time distributing money safely. Some of this money may only be retrievable by Saddam, some only by his immediate family, some by "stay behind" and "terrorist" organizations.)
Tens of billions in offshore accounts, and hundreds of millions in bullion, $100 bills, and treasure from the museums, plus assorted military know-how and weaponry.
Ah, this is gonna fund a _lot_ of merriment!
I just hope they're not as incompetent as the less well-funded Al Qa'aida. I hope they plan to use some of these tens of billions, some of their weaponry, taking out the real target.

I will gladly make this trade of liberties:

And get rid of 90% of all government  functions and staff in general: roll things back to 1925 levels, in  terms of percentages. (I would favor reducing government further, but  1925 levels would be a great start.)

Provided the quarantine is only for medical reasons, and is never used  to isolate people as punishment, for political reasons, for economic  reasons, etc., it's an extreme measure which is consistent, I  believe  with the Constitution. (And with anarchocapitalist principles, if we  had such a system: one's insurers would likely insist on quarantine as  a condition for continued coverage, for example.)
A larger principle is that those who are in risky locations and/or  social situations pay for their increased risk. So a person in Kansas  should not pay for my earthquake risks, nor I for his tornado risks. A  person living in Oregon, where essentially few natural risks exist,  would be rewarded for his choice and a person living in hurricane  country would be punished for his choice.

But in practice, in real practice out on the streets, this has never been where the anti-smoking laws have been invoked. No state in the U.S., to my knowledge, bans smoking outside, on public streets.
There may be a few places near public congregation areas, near air intakes, etc. There may even be a few isolated cases of towns passing "no smoking anywhere on our streets" laws. But, by and large, the anti-smoking laws are confined to restaurants, office buildings, stores, city offices, and other indoor places.
So the real debate is not about Harmon's extreme example of not liking the smell of cigarettes when he walks past a smoker, but the issue of anti-smoking laws in the above examples.
And here the issue is about as nearly unambiguous as one can get: it is up to the property owner to decide on smoking policies on his property. This was as it once was, and it worked very well. Some restaurants barred smoking, some permitted it, some set up different sections. Likewise, some companies barrred smoking, some permitted it, some set up smoking lounges, etc.
(As a nonsmoker, as one who has never taken a single puff on any kind of cigarette or cigar or pipe, I thought smoking was incredibly wasteful, dirty, and annoying. I used to see engineers and technicians going off to take smoking breaks (they would have argued that their alertness was then raised by the nicotine hit). Whatever my views, it was up to my employer to establish his policies. It was not up to some outside party to tell my employer what to allow and what not to allow.)
The Schelling point for such rights was agreed-upon a couple of centuries ago with the protection of property rights. My house, my rules. Your house, your rules.
Examples like Sarin are not  helpful, as they differ massively from the annoyance of smoking.

These reasons are largely why ear shape, ear-eye-mouth geometry, etc., have been increasingly used in face recognition schemes. It is very difficult to use makeup to modify fundamental geometries over these scales, and fundamental geometries are easy to do math on (using affine or projective geometry, for example).
While a woman may be able to change her eye appearance, her lip shape, or even her eyebrow shape, she cannot easily change the affine geometry of ear-nose-eye-chin. Men cannot do even this, lest they be considered fags, but they can of course change beard characteristics...which is why no face recognitions worth a dime to Big Brother use facial hair (or hair style in general) as a determinant.
A friend of mine is doing a lot of work with "support vector machines" as generalization of neural nets, Hopfield networks, and other learning systems. Quite amazing how hard it is to hide from such classifiers. A little bit of makeup just doesn't do it, not when these systems have been trained on hundreds of thousands of exemplars with varying amounts of eye shade, eye liner, lipstick, and facial hair alterations.

@_subject: double-spending prevention w. spent coins 
I have a _completely_ different impression of which model has been more prominent around Cypherpunks.
I agree that Chaum and Brands have had more regime-friendly schemes, heavily involving identity revealing under some circumstances, but I would hardly say that they are either prominent Cypherpunks or that their approaches are prominent _around_ Cypherpunks. The earliest Chaum system, circa 1985-89, sought to preserve full 2-way untraceability via online clearing. Later Chaum systems--and Brands systems at all times, as I recall--made various compromises in what I think were ill-fated attempts to be more palatable to the various dictators in the world.
I also disagree that a model where identity is embedded in digital money has more technically interesting characteristics than a pure, first-class system has. More cruft and more baroqueness, yes, as all such systems somehow requiring identity or "is-a-person" credentials, no matter how well disguised, have more cruft and baroqueness.
A clean system requiring no identity would be much more interesting to see today. It's how bearer bonds and "markers" and various other forms of money (IOUs, chop marks, warehouse receipts, "pay to the holder of" forms) work. Systems based on identity, even when the identity is only findable via alleged double spending, are more like certain kinds of This is also cleaner in that the security for not letting the digital money leak out (be copied) belongs where it should belong: with the holder.  If the would-be double spender was merely careless with his digital money, by allowing the critical numbers to be seen by others, then he is justly punished by having another "get to the train station locker" before he did.
If he _himself_ attempts to double spend...well, this is impossible in a system where the first presenter (first to the train locker) gets the money (contents of the locker).
Online clearing also offers the best way to "ping" digital cash systems. (Which is the protection against a bank attempting with any regularity to make claims that money was already withdrawn, that a digital money token was already "spent.")
 From my 1994 Cyphernomicon (accessible via searching with Google, of "12.6.5. Double spending
            - Some approaches involve constantly-growing-in-size coins at
               each transfer, so who spent the money first can be deduced
               (or variants of this). And N. Ferguson developed a system
               allowing up to N expenditures of the same coin, where N is
               a parameter. [Howard Gayle reminded me of this,             - "Why does everyone think that the law must immediately be
               invoked when double spending is detected?....Double
               spending is an informational property of digital cash
               systems. Need we find malicious intent in a formal
               property?  The obvious moralism about the law and double
               spenders is inappropriate.  It evokes images of revenge                retribution, which are stupid, not to mention of negative
               economic value." [Eric Hughes, 1994-08-27]  (This also
               relates to Eric's good point that we too often frame                issue in terms of loaded terms like "cheating,"                and "enemies," when more neutral terms would carry less
               meaning-obscuring baggage and would not give our "enemies"
               (:-}) the ammunition to pass laws based on such terms.)

            + Chaum's double-spending detection systems
              - Chaum went to great lengths to develop system which
                 preserve anonymity for single-spending instances, but
                 which break anonymity and thus reveal identity for                  spending instances. I'm not sure what market forces
                 caused him to think about this as being so important,                  it creates many headaches. Besides being clumsy, it
                 require physical ID, it invokes a legal system to try to
                 collect from "double spenders," and it admits the
                 extremely serious breach of privacy by enabling stings.
                 For example, Alice pays Bob a unit of money, then                  Alice spends that money before Bob can...Bob is then
                 revealed as a "double spender," and his identity                  to whomver wanted it...Alice, IRS, Gestapo, etc. A very
                 broken idea. Acceptable mainly for small transactions.
            +  Multi-spending vs. on-line clearing
              - I favor on-line clearing. Simply put: the first spending
                 is the only spending. The guy who gets to the train
                 locker where the cash is stored is the guy who gets it.
                 This ensure that the burden of maintaining the secret is
                 on the secret holder.

Regarding "digital notes circulating in the wild without server contact," you need to look at some of the articles here (Cypherpunks) from around 1994-97 on "money changing."
Cf. articles by Doug Barnes, Ian Goldberg, myself, and others. Accessible via Google.
Basically, there is no reason why intermediaries will not develop who agree to take in digital money and issue new digital money, for a fee.
The operation of making change is just this.
In principle, and probably fairly quickly in practice, the connection with an "issuing bank" (whatever that strange thing may be) is not needed often.
"Everyone a moneychanger" and "agnostic" systems work for reasons that would take a lot of time to get into. Several dozen articles, as noted above, get into this.

You don't need to take our word for it--you need to see why modern cryptography avoids trust issues almost completely.
I suggest that you dig up Chaum's "Communications of the ACM" paper from 1985: "Transaction Systems to Make Big Brother Obsolete." I read it when it came out, and it triggered many ideas. It's online, or was as of a few years ago.
Also, look at his paper on "Dining Cryptographers" to see how information-theoretically secure messages can be sent.
Forget worrying about the details of various ciphers in Schneier's book, at least until you have grasped the essence of not relying on trust or "I promise not to look" b.s. schemes.
BTW, a more abstract book is Oded Goldreich's "Foundations of Cryptography--Basic Tools," 2001. A little disorganized in places, but lots of core concepts.
When you have fully grokked the way messages can be sent without any practical way of tracing their origin, as in the dining cryptographers example, your eyes will be opened. And zero-knowledge interactive proof systems (ZKIPS) will blow your mind. Never again will you argue in terms of "trust me" and "so long as they don't subpoena me" and "I promise not to look."

I should have also made clear that the digital notes do not circulate around and around, without server contact (redemption). For one thing, such circulation would a) expose the digital numbers to copying by intermediaries and b) defeat the idea of untraceability. And if the note were not redeemable, the "stuckee" would have no recourse unless the identity of the links were known (and measures could be taken, blah It is best to think of a digital note as a _relationship_ between a and b: aRb. An arrow. A transfer relationship. Alice sends to Bob a digital money token. What he does with it is another transaction (canonically, he sends it to a bank, and, if it is redeemed, he is satisfied. He may also be a bank, or the digital money token may be a form of money he recognizes, as with a remailer token, a stamp).
It is best not to think of there being any intermediate steps. That is, any two nodes linked by an arrow have no other nodes between them. The token does not get passed from hand to hand to hand, no matter how complex a series of transactions is. (To do so invites copying, which leads to the double spending problems so often discussed.)
(Digression: Even actual folding money works this way, basically. Alice transfers money to Bob who transfers it to Charles, and so on. Of course, with digital money the same token is not transmitted this way. Each stage effectively reissues the money (or Bob "redeems" the money at a bank, which is a special, terminal case).)
"Money" is a loaded term, conjuring up various and often-contradictory images of paper notes, bullion, coins, IOUs, personal checks, cashier's checks, warehouse receipts, bearer bonds, drugs, artwork, wire transfers, SWIFT transfers, etc.
The relationship R for money is something which needs to be discussed at more length: there may be forms of R for small value or coin-like uses, for medium value banknote-like uses, or even for high value bearer bond-like or bank-like uses. Just as there are many forms of non-digital money, for various uses and with various levels of security and authentication, so too must one expect various kinds of digital money. First class objects are critically important here, but not in a "one size fits all" sense. (Not sure if this is clear or not...as I said, much more needs to be said.)
One of the interesting properties of the relationship R is that it involves _belief_. This is really what money is all about. The fact that one's belief that a $20 banknote with the right Andrew Jackson portrait on it is "real money" is only an expression of one's belief that the odds of it not being accepted by some other party, or by the U.S. Treasury, is close to nil. In areas where banknotes are more commonly forged, and thus not accepted, such a belief would be naive.
And so on for various other forms of money. Even digital money. Which gets us into reputations and ping systems (with blinding, an issuer can decide to "burn" (renege on) particular users, which makes repudiation difficult and not something banks which wish to stay in business will lightly do).
Properties of these graphs (or, in certain interesting cases, lattices) are crucial to understanding digital money.

I don't believe ZKS ended up targeting the remailer niche ("space") we are interested in. In the years that Freedom nyms were being sold, how many were used to post to this list? How many were used to post to Usenet? A set nearly of measure zero.
I assume _some customers_ were using Freedom...I just don't recall ever receiving a message from any of them, or seeing any of them on the lists and groups I frequent.
So the uses I expected would expose the owners of Freedom to investigation for (just as operators of remailers have been exposed to being shut down for) never materialized.
We will never know whether ZKS would have faced pressures when it was used for song-swapping or extortion threats or child porn, as the customer base never got large enough.

I'm surprised at you for thinking trust is some number that is either 0 or 1.
All crypto is economics, and so is all trust.
Consider two situations:
Situation 1:  "I have generated a key for you and will send it securely. You can trust me not to look at it and not to reveal it to anyone else....Well, not unless Saddam's men force me to, or not until John Ashcroft threatens to hold me as an illegal combatant if I don't cooperate. Or not until someone offers me $500 cash, no questions asked, for just a peek. Or not until I realize that this key is being used to further right wing Nazi causes. Or..."
Situation 2: "Determining your private key requires an attacker to either monitor your keystrokes and bug your computer, so you'd better secure it, or it requires factoring a 309 decimal digit number associated and derivable from your public key. So far, the best algorithms have only factored a 137-digit number [for example] and no mathematicians have yet found cleverer ways. Great fame would await anyone who found a significantly faster method, even a Fields Medal, and yet no one has yet revealed one."
Now I maintain there is a huge difference in the valuations placed on the "trust" in these two cases.
If you wish to believe that Joe Sixpack saying he promises to keep your private key secret is on the same footing as the apparent difficulty of factoring very large numbers (and if 309 digits is deemed too small, only a tiny increase in key generation effort and later use to go to 500 decimal digits or even 1000) then you are of course welcome to your All crypto is economics.

But of course people aren't going to learn new human languages for such an ephemeral and mostly useless reason as to hide their textual clues.
Kascinski got nailed because his rants were so long, running to many newspaper pages (as they were printed, at the FBI's request or his request, or both, I forget the details) and were filled with a lot more than just grammatical and stylistic clues: the rants had his political views, his analysis of history, etc. It's doubtful that K. would have had any interest in trying to write in some synthetic language, stripped of various stylistic choices and options.

Any given mint only needs the belief by its customers that it will honor (redeem) its tokens.
Such a mint can, by demonstration, be as small as a corner store offering gift certificates.
Naturally, the blinded nature of tokens means that customers can "ping" such mints as often as they like. (There is the "pack up, leave town, and burn customers" scam, as there always is with a bank or mint which has not yet redeemed all of its obligations. The best fix for this is to distribute monies at many such mints. It is unlikely, though remotely possible, that all of them or even most of them will abscond at the same time. Note that reputation per se does not stop this scam from happening even with meatspace banks. It is rare, however, as most banks deduce that getting a fraction of a continuing stream of business is more advantageous than absconding.)

Rebutting Mr. Anonymous, the dyspeptic original poster,  with specific, single examples of where he is wrong only helps make his argument seem Every one of his examples where he claims "none of this exists, in the world of the cypherpunks" can be rebutted by many examples.
I make no claim that we invented all of these things, though in several of the instances we were the first to use them, the first to talk about them, and even the actual inventors of some of them.
* P2P -- BlackNet was operational in 1993. Remailers were used for file sharing even before then. One of the few books on P2P discusses several Cypherpunks and their effects. We may not have coined the term "P2P," but we sure were talking about peer-to-peer and "everyone a remailer" and "everyone a mint" long before P2P became the darling of venture capitalists for a few short dot com boom quarters!
In any case, Napster, Kazaa, Freenet, Morpheus, etc. have been talked about many times here. Sure, we don't run the list based on P2P (unless the distributed CP list is considered P2P, which it could be, in which case we've been doing it since before Napster existed), but we know non-hierarchical, flat, first class object systems like nobody's * File sharing -- Covered above. And don't forget the release of RC4 on our list. And the Mykotronx docs. And so on. MojoNation was based on distributed file sharing, for backups, etc.
(Before Cypherpunks, I worked to help Dave Ross and Jim Bennett develop their ideas for a distributed, file sharing back up system. This was in * Freenet -- Covered above. Many here know Ian Clarke. Many here, present or past, have themselves worked on systems superior to Freenet. (MojoNation, Vines/Tarzan, BitTorrent, etc.) And many Cypherpunks worked at present or in the past for companies working in this area (C2Net, now owned by Red Hat, The Anonymizer, Zero Knowledge, MojoNation, etc.). To argue that we are uninvolved with one particular system, Freenet, is misleading in the extreme.
* IIRC -- ?  Sure, I guess. Those who like them, use them. People set up CP relay chats some years ago. I checked in and found the usual babble. Those who like it, use it. By the way, Cypherpunks (mainly Hugh Daniel) set up a 3-way DES-encrypted virtual meeting between Mountain View, Cambridge (MA), and Northern Virginia. This was back in 1994. * Weblogs -- They're there for those who want them. Our mailing list is not a blog, for the obvious reasons that blogs are mostly just extended rants with hypertext pointers. Like newspaper columns. Boring technology, been around for years. (I've been reading John Baez's blog on mathematical physics for more than 10 years now: . Of course, he didn't call it a blog when he started, nor does he call it a blog now. But it for sure is. Likewise, Dave Winer didn't call his early systems blogs, but I've been using his tools for well over a decade, including his hypertext outline processor, MORE.
* WiFi -- give me a fucking break! Wirelesss connections abound at CP meetings. And we were some of the earliest users of the Metricom wireless modems, circa 1995, with a special deal offered by some Metricom founders. Seeing laptops Metricomed to search engines for instant answers from the crowd was impressive, circa 1996-7. It still is. It is true that wireless connections are not being used for remailers, a topic I wrote about extensively in 1992-3, and is covered in my Cyphernomicon, and is even mentioned in my 1988 Manifesto. The reasons are manyfold why wireless connections are not common for such uses (mostly, lack of density where the wireless benefits would appear).
* Open Source -- Mr. Anonymous is either ignorant or is being deliberately deceptive. PGP was distributed around the world via the efforts of several Cypherpunks, including Lucky Green, using open source models, with source code distributed at "open meetings, open to all." Ditto for several other systems, including remailer code, mint code, etc.
* Open Spectrum -- This is even more laughable. I guess Mr. Anonymous doesn't follow the work of Eric and Steve on GNU Radio, the open source, open spectrum effort. Actual demos, including to a stunned FCC (from what I hear). Funded by Cypherpunks, designed by Cypherpunks, built by Cypherpunks, used by Cypherpunks. And at the September meeting at my house we also heard from the Aetherwire ultrawideband folks.

He started out by loading them into a CD changer and automatically duping them to DAT. Now he just uses a 48x reader and 24x writer (I think that's the speed) and copies each in a matter of a couple of minutes.

I don't see any basis for supporting a "law against lying."
Unless a contract is involved, lying is just another form of speech.

Should a newspaper be prosecuted for publishing a claim that the Sumerian prediction that Nibiru, aka Planet X, will stop the earth from rotating on May 15, 2003?
Should someone be prosecuted for saying the Holocaust never happened, or was exaggerated greatly by the Jewish lobby?
The answer to all libertarians, and the answer embodied in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, is "No."
Of course, the idea of reputation matters. And--Declan can correct me or clarify things--newspapers and perhaps even reporters have professional organizations and other "standards and practices" type of seals of approval. Something like "This newspaper is a member of the National Assocation for the Advancement of Uncolored Journalism," or Probably the Weekly World News ("Baby Eats Own Hand, Aliens Suspected") would not be a member in good standing of the NAAUJ.

It takes more time for marching orders to propagate from Washington to London, so there's this delay. And sometimes the signals with Washington get crossed.

"Galloway, a member of Prime Minister Tony Blair's ruling Labour Party,   is currently at his holiday home in Portugal writing a book about  the Iraq war. He has issued a string of forceful denials from there.
Labour Party officials are already examining controversial remarks  by Galloway who called Blair and President George W Bush "wolves"  for attacking Iraq.
The Scottish MP, a constant target of tabloid attacks, has been dubbed  MP for Baghdad Central for his opposition to the Iraq war."

It seems to me that the tabloids and others calling someone "MP for Baghdad Central" is a counterexample to your claim.
Of course, this isn't a survey of the _prevalence_ or _magnitude_ of the claims, but it's an example that at least some Brits on the pro-war side are using slurs about the patriotism of the opponents.

This debate some of you are having about whether "free speech" applies to corporations as well as individuals, or only to individuals, or whether it covers "political or financial gain," and so on, is silly.
The First Amendment says nothing about "individuals" or "political or financial gain."
In fact, what it says is quite simple, and should be memorized by all who wish to discuss it"
Amendment I
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

It does NOT say "Individuals get to say what they wish, provided it is not for financial or political gain, or, like, is a lie and stuff. And corporations....fuhgettabout it!"
It says Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. "No law" means no law. And if there is no law, there cannot be a law which applies to corporations consisting of one person (they exist) or of 30 people of 3000 people. Congress cannot make a low abridging Nike's freedom of speech.

I guarantee that anything a human eye can read can be captured for later use, whether by bypassing the probably-weak program, by using other tools to read the mail spool, by capturing the screen buffer, or, if worst comes to worst, simply photographing the screen with an inexpensive digital camera and then either using the captured image as is or by running it through an OCR.
It happens that I have met the founder of this company at a couple of parties at my house, so I have no idea what got into him with this late-90s-founded company. Maybe he was just exploiting the suckers.

As I'm feeling chatty this morning, I'll comment on another trend I've been seeing a lot of. While reading the Andrew Orlowski piece on Robin Hanson and the PAM/terror futures thing
( the URL is   )
I got to thinking about "What ever happened to Max More?" (the founder of the Extropians group)
I did some Googling and found out he and his wife (Natasha Vita-More...the Extropians often change their names to more future-sounding monikers) are some kind of "motivational coaches" or involved in software to do the same.
Then while Googling on Omnivora Policy Systems, or whatever that "disappearing ink" company is, I ran across the name Jeff Ubois, the guy who attended some of my parties. His resume is chockfull of references to "motivational' and "coaching" and similar squishy-soft consulting gigs.
Way too many people think they can become the next Tony Robbins, that Neanderthal on late night t.v. selling motivational tapes.
The good ideas, the good companies, the good technology...it comes from good ideas and good products, not from EST nonsense, not from motivational coaches, not from late night hucksters.
Having talked to some of these folks, though not for the past few years, it really bugs me to see them going down this bullshit path.

The bigger and more glaring flaw--pointed out by many of us, years ago--was in having an identifiable nexus for pressure to be applied. Cf. the archives for much discussion of what would happen when MI-6 finally got tired of them, or of when Mossad decided to do something about things, or when Hollywood got fed up.
Bruce Sterling dealt with this in "Islands in the Net," circa 1988, which predated Cypherpunks by several years and which was coming out just about when I was writing up my first things on crypto anarchy. I though Sterling had placed much too much emphasis on the havens' attempt to be physically secure by owning small countries and not nearly enough (if any) emphasis on using strong cryptography to achieve security inside cypherspace, a la "True Names."
The idea of being secure in plain sight within the claimed territorial waters of Britain was just too laughable.

Sadly, pleading is often the only viable choice. When the cops are  liars, when the judges are ignoring the Constitution, when the appeals  courts are too busy to hear appeals for many years (unless the appeal  is an emergency appeal to halt the recall of Gray Davis, that is), and  when sentencing guidelines are fully out of whack with economics and  even with that nebulous concept of "justice," pleading is often the  best of a bad deal.
This is all possible because the plea bargaining system has gotten out  of control. The accused face a plea deal of M months and N dollars if  they plead, or 10M months and 20N dollars if they go to trial and lose,  which is pretty likely when cops lie, when judges ignore the  Constitution, and when juries are made up of people who are  uncontroversial enough so as to have no opinions to disqualify them.
(I was last picked for a jury 30 years ago this summer, back when I  registered as a Republican. In the 30 years since, when I have been  registered as a Libertarian, I have never been selected for a jury.  Meanwhile, some of my know-nothing neighbors tell me about serving  every few years on juries.)
In a couple of criminal cases I have first-hand knowledge of, the plea  deals were made so persuasive and the sentencing guidelines so harsh  (had it gone to trial and the accused found guilty) that to not plea  would have been irresponsible.
You may not like this, and you may have cheered on the fights by the  noble fighters who decided not to plea, but the system is stacked in  favor of pleas. This is our injustice system.

Why is it "nice"?
No comment.
This may or may not have been what Jeff believed, or wanted to believe, or told you was the case, but I don't buy that this is their business model.. Their Web site is filled with stuff about how "Save" menus are subverted, so as to, they claim, make it impossible for copies to be saved, blah blah. This hardly fits with your view of a bunch of benign little bears all sitting around cooperating.
Further, the site natters about how Omnivora will support government requirements about unauthorized persons seeing mail (how? how will even their crude expiry approach stop unauthorized viewings of mail?).
This is again inconsistent with the picture of friendly little bears all cooperating. Friendly little bears don't need to have their "Save As" buttons elided (not that this will stop screen grabs and photos, as I mentioned). Nor would friendly little cooperating bears show their messages to "unauthorized viewers," now would they?
(Speculatively, I would not be even slightly surprised if Omnivora is doing more than just nominally erasing some messages. To wit, storing copies for later examination by Authorities with Ministerial Warrants. As Jeff Ubois no longer seems to be attached to Omnivora, perhaps his vision was rejected.)

They're also throwing sentencing enhancements in if guns are found.
"Use your Second Amendment rights and get an extra 20 years added to your sentence."
(Seems to be a pattern. Using either First or Second Amendment rights triggers a harsh sentence.)
The whole U.S. prison system is out of whack, economically. If a local community is responsible for imprisoning a convict, and had to feed and house him, there are some economic constraints that shine through. To wit, my little town of Corralitos isn't going to spend $40,000 a year to imprison a pot smoker. Nor is the larger city of Santa Cruz going to build a SuperMax prison to house a thousand people who have used drugs, talked about bombs, or sent spam mail. But since local communities don't pay for imprisoning their own people, it's a classic game theory situation where costs are delinked from choices.
It doesn't cause lawmakers anything to "get tough on crime" by adding "sentencing enhancements." In fact, they get to tell their constituents they have made the streets safer by taking those dangerous First Amendment radicals off the streets.
I was reading someplace that one of the main lobbying forces for "more laws" are some of the small towns in California, for example, which are suffering economically and think that having a big prison located near their town will "generate jobs." They lobby their local politicians for both more laws, tougher sentences, and a prison in their town.
The politicians put forward bills, recruit supporters ("you scratch my back and..."), and more spending happens. And more laws. And tougher sentences. And more prisoners. And more prisons. And more jobs. Everybody's happy, except California and the U.S. are deeply in debt, an historically high percentage of people are in "gladiator schools" in the state and country, taxes are way too high, and the Constitution has been shredded.
Whichever game theory theories apply, it's a mess. And a tragedy. And a common tragedy, even a tragedy of the commons.

@_subject: Computer Voting Expert, Dr. Rebecca Mercuri, Ousted From 
It's a meme we might want to spread: "They stole the election."
I was intensely opposed to the gibberish about how the Republicans "stole" the Florida vote, for multiple reasons. First, the Dems wanted to change the rules after the outcome went against them...they wanted "hanging chads" counted in their favor (ultimately, of course, this wouldn't have even swayed the outcome, as careful studies by newspapers showed). Second, they wanted the Elections Commission to somehow adjust the outcome based on exit interviews with little old Jewish ladies who claimed they wanted to vote for Algore but who actually voted for Pat Buchanan or Jeffery Dahmer or whomever it was that was opposite Chad Gore on the ballot (note that Democrats designed the ballot). Third, they wanted only precincts known to be leaning toward Chad Gore recounted from scratch. (I would have _opposed_ a statewide recount on general common sense and legal grounds, too, but for sure I was aghast at the proposal to only recount selected precincts: "We'll keep recounting until the outcome fluctuates in our favor!")
But I now see that spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the outcome of elections serves to undermine confidence in government and make more people skeptical of the whole process. The meme that is commonly heard today is "Bush and the Supreme Court stole the election." This is good.
Shenanigans like the above story, with respected experts like Mercuri and Chaum excluded from a conference after they duly registered, will be good fodder for conspiracy stories about the 2004 election. (Actually, the recall vote on the governor of California is coming up on October 7th. Election officials are already claiming the ballots can't be ready in time, the machines will have to be brought out of mothballs and somehow made to work, and so on.

I enjoyed interacting with Perry about 10-11 years ago, mostly on the Extropians list. Perry was a major political ranter (even if it is not true that he coined the phrase "Utopia is not an option"). (Extropians was a privately-owned list, and what eventually drove me away was the silliness involving "trials" for those accused of insulting others, or violating some rules, or disrespecting the Official Beliefs. I attribute this silliness not to malice by the Extropian Maximum Leaders, but by the very nature of private lists and the almost unavoidable tendency to try to "perfect" lists by tweaking what people can and can't say.)

First, those who think there are "perfectly random" experiments or numbers are living in a state of sin, to paraphrase John von Neumann.
Second, despite the above, good approximations to random behavior are easy to obtain: radioactive decays, lava lamps, Johnson noise in diodes, etc. The important aspects of probability theory emerge even with "imperfect" sources of apparent randomness.
Third, the expected distribution of heads and tails in a series of 32 coin tosses is approximated closely by the binomial distribution. The key concepts are combinations and permutations.
The expected probability of "all heads" is given by (0.5)^32. There are more chances of seeing 1 head and 31 tails, as the head can appear in any of the 32 positions. ("the combination of 32 things taken 1 at a time"). And so on, up to the maximum of 16 heads, 16 tails...although this particular outcome is not very likely.
Fourth, my point was that there is relatively low probability that 32 tosses will result in exactly 16 heads and 16 tails. Given enough experiments, the distribution of outcomes will approximately follow the familiar bell-shaped curve, centered at 16H/16T, but with some chance of each of 0H/32T, 1H/31T,...., 31H/0T, 32H/0T.
Fifth, not to sound harsh or snippy or sarcastic, but this is really basic stuff. There is a big gap in your education. Even if not taught this in 9th grade (or whatever the equivalent is in India), this is stuff that should be apparent through thinking about the way chance events occur. I urge you to suspend your "advanced math" questions until you have gone back over the more basic things.
(It's crazy to try to understand entropy and the algorithmic information theory work of Greg Chaitin and others without knowing the 18th-century results on probability of people like Pascal, Poisson, There are many Web pages with class notes on probability, encyclopedia entries, etc. And I suggest experiments with coin tosses.

For any sequence of n fair tosses, the "length after compression" of the outcome is roughly, modulo some constants and factor, (1 - 2^(-n)), where "1" is the uncompressed length. In other words, as n gets large nearly all strings have a "length after compression" that is close to the original length, i.e., little compression.

Start small. Do some experiments _yourself_.
Take a coin out of your pocket. I assume your local coin has something that may be called a "head" and something that may be called a "tail." In any case, decide what you want to call each side.
Flip the coin very high in the air and let it land on the ground without any interference by you.
This is a "fair toss." (That subtle air currents may affect the landing is completely unimportant, as you will see even if you have doubts about it now.)
Now let's try a little piece of induction on this one, single toss. Remember when you had said earlier that a "perfectly random coin toss" would have exactly equal numbers of heads and tails? Well, with a single toss there can ONLY be either a head or a tail.
The outcome will be ONE of these, not some mixture of half and half.
This proves, by the way, that any claim that a random coin toss must result in equal numbers of heads and tails in any particular experiment.
Now toss the coin a second time and record the results.
(I strongly urge you to actually do this experiment. Really. These are the experiments which teach probability theory. No amount of book learning substitutes.)
So the coin has been tossed twice in this particular experiment. There is now the possibility for equal numbers of heads and tails....but for the second coin toss to give the opposite result of the first toss, "every time, to balance the outcomes," the coin or the wind currents would have to "conspire" to make the outcome the opposite of what the first toss gave. (This is so absurd as to be not worth discussing, except that I know of no other way to convince you that your theory that equal numbers of heads and tails must be seen cannot be true in any particular experiment. The more mathematical way of saying this is that the "outcomes are independent." The result of one coin toss does not affect the next one, which may take place far away, in another room, and so on.)
In any case, by the time a third coin toss happens there again cannot be equal numbers of heads and tails, for obvious reasons. And so on.
Do this experiment. Do this experiment for at least 10 coin tosses. Write down the results. This will take you only a few minutes.
Then repeat the experiment and write down the results.
Repeat it as many times as you need to to get a good feeling for what is going on. And then think of variations with dice, with cards, with other sources of randomness.
And don't "dry lab" the results by imagining what they must be in your head. Actually get your hands dirty by flipping the coins, or dealing the cards, or whatever. Don't cheat by telling yourself you already know what the results must be.
Only worry about the deep philosophical implications of randomness after you have grasped, or grokked, the essence.

This is the "dead librarian switch."
And in these times when the Constitution has been shredded, when dissidents are being sent to concentration camps in Cuba, when thought criminals who post links to explosives knowledge are in prison, perhaps "dead librarian switch" has literal meaning.
I am giving thought to visiting one of my local libraries and sauntering up the checkout desk and casually saying "So, what about this Patriot Act and librarians narcing us out to Big Brother?"
Then, after hearing her explanation, just as casually saying "Well, I hope it never happens. Because if I ever learn that you have narced me out, I would of course have to lie in wait until you leave the library and then do what needs to be done."
Seriously, maybe librarians need to realize at a gut level that if they act as stool pigeons, as narcs, then some of them may pay the same price that rats in general sometimes pay.

Were I setting up such a system, I think I'd  look closely at installing the dishes in small plastic sheds. Small Rubbermaid plastic tool sheds, for example. Even an upended plastic garbage can would probably work well, though it might look a little odd. (Not odd enough to get the attention of the roving vans, though.)
If on a rooftop, where a garden shed or plastic garbage can would look out of place, a cylinder of light plastic (semi-rigid, not the Saran wrap stuff) would look like just another rooftop piece of hardware. A wander through a Home Depot might reveal something already made which would hold a 1.5 m dish very nicely.
A cylinder with an overhanging roof would like a roof vent, and would also shelter the cylinder walls from ice and other microwave absorbers.
I live in rural, hilly area, so I doubt any FCC vans are rolling around looking for (unlicensed?) directional microwave dishes. If I lived in any kind of urban or even suburban area, and were setting up such a dish system, I'd look for ways to camouflage it.
Transparency of the plastic to the specific microwaves should be checked, of course. Easy to check.
Detection of the dish by side-lobe leakage is harder.

This has been proposed for, but it fails for the usual reasons.
An ISP is free to say "anyone requesting a tap is required to pay a fee," just as any ISP is free to say that it will handle installation of special Carnivore equipment for a certain fee.
But when Big Brother commands that his Carnivore boxes be added, ISPs are afraid to shoot his agents who trespass.
And so the work is done for free. And so, too, will the fees you talk about be waived.
I think my solution may be best: take a few ISPs who have bent over for Big Brother and kill their owners and staff. A few ISP owners found necklaced and smoking may send a message to others. It works for the Mob in a way none of the more civilized approaches can possibly work.

The would-be censor forwarded it to me as a warning, that he was "in synch" with my own ISP and that I would likely soon be either losing my account or getting a visit from the cops (he claimed to have forwarded several of my posts to "law enforcement").
My larger point in this discussion here is the issue of what William Burroughs called "the policeman inside."
Some librarians are probably now thinking they have a patriotic duty to see what people are reading and to report any "suspicious" behavior. Part of the intent of the Patriot Act and the Library Awareness Program was to bamboozle the nation's librarians into acting as the kind of "ward watchers" that were once so common in the Soviet Union (the babushkas who sat on each floor of apartment buildings and filed reports on the comings and goings of their flock).
Just as some ISP owners seem to think it their duty to "talk to the police" about customers whom the DA has not charged with any crime but whom the "policeman inside" thinks may be committing thoughtcrime.
I'm not hopeful that the evils of this "policeman inside" mentality can be demonstrated by mere, calm discussion. Reminding librarians that narcing out customers for reading magazines or books may result in violence against them may be useful. It may be that killing just a couple will make the point.
Perhaps a small price to pay.

And there is nothing immoral in discussing the fact that actions may have consequences.
Take the work camps described in Solzhenitsyn's "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch." (Or, of course, the Nazi extermination camps. Or the U.S. concentration camps in Gitmo.) The camp management clearly sought a docile, "policeman inside," stoolie-oriented system where informers and "capos" (those who cooperate and act as de facto guards) see no reason NOT to be stoolies and capos.
But merely the threat that stoolies and capos will be found with their throats slit is often enough to deter such behaviors.
My point is that if librarians even think there is some small chance that someone they narc out to Big Brother will kill them or their families, such stoolie behavior may drop precipitously.

You're being way too unimaginative, or literal, or something.
This is at the discussion stage, and probably will be followed-through by others (if at all). The too literal part comes from thinking that discussions here mean someone here is going to kill some librarians. The too unimaginative part comes from thinking that publicity about the idea will not itself have an effect.
The Mob doesn't actually have to kill too many stoolies for it to be widely known that ratting can be a very dangerous business.
Maybe Big Brother will create a Witness Relocation Program especially for librarians who turn state's evidence.

References: <6.0.0.22.2.20031205092507.02d7d7f0
DO NOT FORWARD THIS MESSAGE TO ANY OTHER LISTS. I AM GETTING TIRED OF SEEING CYPHERPUNKS JUST BE THE DUMPING GROUND FOR STUFF FROM OTHER In almost all foreseeable cases, a system which allows identity escrow _cost more_ than a system which does not. This is analogous to the increased costs of a identity-based money system over an immediate-clearing, non-identity-based system.
As an example, consider the network of CP or Mixmaster sorts of remailers. To package a payload through N remailers is a relatively easy thing for a a sender to do. But to arrange for propagation of "escrowed identity" at each (or most) of these N remailer nodes is Any  of these N remailers, in K different countries/jurisdictions, may use the "legal warrant" access method to open the identity escrow. For example, Finland in the Scientology/NOTS case...Finland surely would have used their "legal warrant" method had such an option existed.
This is part of a larger issue, a philosophical one, about who controls "legal warrants." The Jew can be killed by using legal warrants, in Third Reich Germany. The libertarian in Soviet Russia. The pornographer in Canada. And nearly anyone who deviates from the official line in these beknighted states of america: smut peddlers, drug legalization advocates, supporters of Russia vs. Chechnya prior to 9/11, supporters of Chechnya vs. Russia after 9/11, liberators of Diebold documents showing the weakness of their voting machines, and so on and on. See my 1995-6 list of our enemies (Catholics, Whigs, Mormons, Communists...) for a very long list of those for whom "identity escrow" would have meant death or imprisonment in these beknighted states.
Back to the cost issue. Prof. Lessig argues that voluntary identity escrow systems should be "encouraged." How/ Through nattering to people about how they ought to use a more expensive, less flexible system which exposes them to possible danger and which costs them more to use than the stronger alternative?
Or "encouraged" in the sense of using state power to make stronger systems illegal or artificially taxed at higher rates?
Why doesn't the U.S.G. just set up a "Big Brother Remailer" with the kind of identity escrow proposed?
Let's then see how many freedom fighters working for the overthrow of the U.S. government use it. Let's see how many critics of the Church of Scientology, threatened with lawsuits and "legal warrants," use it. Let's see how much child porn gets traded on it.

And there are so many other points, long discussed here (1992-present), which Lessig's proposal would run into:
* what if someone, like me, forwards items sent untraceably to me? (The Lessig Escrow remailer does not even know it is from me, or forwarded by me, unless and until he gets a "legal warrant" to open the contents...too late, then.)
(If passing on a comment from another is illegal, on what basis? A remailer is just as easily seen as an "editor" or "re-commenter.")
* if government controls remailers, what of those plotting against government? Is Jefferson supposed to use the King's remailers?
* if the systems Lessig thinks should be "encouraged" are in fact set up--and no doubt some such systems already exist--how can they know that they are not themselves being used as part of a chain which includes traditionally-untraceable (CP, Mix remailers) upstream? Without looking, using their ostensible "legal warrants," a Big Brother Remailer has no way of knowing that the messages sent through from "Tim" were not just the messages of others.
BTW, an argument I heard years ago from a proponent of an identity escrow system, long before Lessig, was that this approach would be blocked by making "Tim" responsible for all words or messages flowing into an IE remailer, even those he could not read (because they had been encrypted). The idea is to stop this chaining attack by making each user responsible for checking all the way back. In other words, for an IE system to work, competitors must be banned. Which is the same conclusion reached via other paths.
(And, though IANAL, even I know that making "Tim" legally responsible even for messages he has no way of knowing fails the "scienter" test. Absent a ban on encryption, what "Tim " has done in passing along to "Larry's Remailer" a message which actually arrived from a non-IE remailer is nothing more than passing along something he was given. He has no knowledge of the contents (scienter requirement) and is not breaking any laws, absent a ban on competitors to IE remailers.)
Anyway, this was hashed out many times in the early 90s and shortly after the very similar proposal for Clipper and other similar forms of key escrow.
I have nothing against Lessig, but it bugs me that he's considered by some to be one of the Great Cyberspace Thinkers when his ideas are so easily dismissed...and were argued on both sides so many years ago.
Larry Lessig ought to read, and think deeply about, the first ten years of traffic on the Cypherpunks list. Especially the first five years.

This actually fits in with something Lessig is widely known for, his "technology-custom-law" trichotomy (*).
(* He may call it something different...I haven't checked in a while. And I recall he may have a fourth component. I was talking in similar terms many years ago, too. Not that I am saying Lessig borrowed from my ideas, as I am sure many of us independently realized this. Cf. via Google some of the things I wrote about VCRs and how they changed the ground truth of what was legally copyable. Or how Gutenberg created a technology which made existing custom (e.g., the Church) and law (e.g., the Guilds) effectively moot.)
Those who make Grand Plans about such things as "pseudonymity with legal warrant access" need to take systems and computer science (and hence math) into account. This usually comes through thinking about possible attacks, weaknesses, and design flaws.
For example, I have cited the obvious case of someone, call him "Tim," using "Larry's LEO-Friendly Remailer." But Tim is _not_ a LEO-friendly remailer, and Tim has taken in articles from other such non-LEO-friendly remailers.
The only way Larry knows that Tim is doing this is if Larry "peeks" (examines the content to see what it is, to see that it does not contain seditious or pornographic or non-LEO-friendly packets). Or Larry can wait for the eventual "legal warrant" and then find that Tim was remailing packets which could not be traced. Oops. Larry can then cancel Tim's account.
More generally, I think Lessig has failed to understand the very fundamental, underlying structure of true Cypherpunks-style remailers:
::request-remailing-to: foo at anotherremailer.org
This can be any arbitrary text, and all that is passed on to the next remailer or recipient.
And this text block is not tagged in any way with sender ID. And this text can be encrypted,
readable only by the specified "nextremailer." And this text block can included further
requests for remailing, and so on and so forth.
Tim again. With this structure, nested and packaged as a payload, for Lessig's scheme to actually give "warrant-only traceability," it must ban such nested remailings. Which means, ban on crypto.
(For if crypto is allowed, then even a warrant cannot crack it. "Oh, then we'll have key escrow...")
And so on. A little bit of thought reveals numerous such attacks on a "LEO-friendly remailer." And the "fixes" are all in the direction of, in the final analysis, banning strong encryption.
Of course, Lessig may say that he is only advocating an ultra-weak system of remailers that only dummies will use. He may say he does not propose to actually ban "strong remailers."
Some argue that weak systems--remailers or crypto--will thrive "because most crooks are lazy" has been dealt with many times. Sure, some people doing things use weak systems, out of ignorance, out of laziness, out of a sense that they are immortal and cannot be caught. But others doing illegal or marginal things are amongst the earliest adopters of relatively robust systems: offshore banks, encrypted disks, and, ironically, secure anonymous remailers.
(When the Finnish police finally forced Julf Helsingius to reveal the pseudonym attached to the Church of Scientology "NOTS" documents, they found that inside was a packet from a true Cypherpunks remailer, whose last node was at C2Net, the company Sameer Parekh founded. End of trail. This showed that even as early as 1995 someone was thinking ahead to the day when the Finnish police would force a "weak pseudonymity" system like PENET (Julf's system, based on earlier code written by another hacker) to give "warranted access" a la Lessig. So much for people being too dumb to use a strong system!)
If Lessig is truly _only_ proposing that some idiots be encouraged to use weak remailers and weak crypto, then, fine, no harm done.
However, the goals Lessig is avowedly seeking, of access to identities through "legal warrants," then his system will rapidly  become unused after the first few "legal warrant" convictions.
So long as strong systems cost little more than weak systems, strong systems prevail. (And, for various reasons, strong systems are in most cases cheaper to use than weak systems.)
In a kind of reverse of Gresham's Law ("weak money drives out good money"), strong crypto drives out weak crypto.
(Actually, this is not so much a reverse of Gresham's Law as its manifestation in terms of what money is: people seek to get rid of (= spend) weak money and hold on to (= hoard, save) strong money. So they spend their "debased" currency and hold on to their gold double eagles. This actually confirms the above point.)
Bottom Line: In the ecology of encryption, remailers, and digital money, weak systems that are LEO-friendly will ultimately lose out to strong systems. Unless the strong systems are outlawed, and maybe not even then.

I have several theories/conjectures about what is happening to mailing First, a lot of the younger folks--who used to be some of the fresh blood for lists like ours--are not users of mailing lists. I expect some of them don't even know such things exist. For them, IM is the norm. (And IM is mostly an interpersonal, chat format.)
Second, blogs seem to have taken over for many formerly active mailing lists. In some of the areas of interest to me, a dozen blogs are frequently read, including the ones with fairly active followup. And example is "Lambda the Ultimate,"  just one of many similar language and programming blogs.
(Personally, I think much is being lost in the shift away from Usenet and mailing lists towards these blogs. For while follow-ups exist for many of them, there is always the sense that one is participating in Dave Winer's blog, or Mitch Kapor's blog, or whatever. Further, many of the blogs take on a "my daily diary" and "random musings" tone. By the way, though I read the good blogs, like LtU, I don't post to any of Third, the explosion of mailing lists, Yahoo discussion groups, "pipermail" groups (such as the E language and "capabilities" folks tend to use), etc., has made many groups "subcritical." (Something we began to see half a dozen years ago, when Cypherpunks had a bunch of close competitors (cryptography, coderpunks, etc.), plus several lists run by Hettinga, plus a couple by Declan, and so on. Cross-posting to Usenet newsgroups was bad enough, but cross-posting to many mailing lists was a major pain. Especially as most lists are closed to outsiders, who can sometimes posts, sometimes not, but where context and followups are lost.)
Fourth, 9/11. A lot of people got very scared of saying what they think. Read the archives and note the drop-off in certain kinds of political discussion. Even some of the former nodes have vanished; my hunch is that many of those subscribed to the vanished nodes never bothered to find another node. (I have no idea how many subscribers the list has. The nodes I know of don't allow listing the subscribers. I would not be surprised if the subscription total has dropped below a few hundred. And of these, clearly only a few dozen regular posters come to mind.)
Fifth, relevant for our list, "crypto is tired." As in Wired's old "wired/tired" joke column (and of course "Wired" is _especially_ tired). Not that crypto is less important now than it was, but, plainly, some things expected have not yet happened, with little prospect of happening soon. And since the basic ideas have been discussed so many times before, in so many ways, not much excitement in discussing "dining cryptographers" for the 7th time, or "how to make PGP more popular" for the 16th time.
Sixth, the lack of news about crypto. No prosecutions of a "folk hero" like Zimmermann to pull in newcomers. No Clipper chip. No bans on crypto (at least not yet).
But even if crypto got trendy again, I just don't see the young students of today flocking to our particular mailing list. Too many other choices. Probably they'll read someone's daily blog....
One last reason, the most controversial one. When I was 40 I really had no difficulty dealing with the 20-year-olds. They seemed basically a lot like I was when I was their age. But something has changed. Maybe it's me, maybe it's not. But now, at the age of almost 52, I find dealing with most of the people in their 20s I encounter, even at CP meetings, much harder. Maybe it's their usually bald heads (seems many guys in their 20s shave their heads). Maybe it's the rings through their noses and eyebrows and lips and other places (shudder). Maybe it's that openly embrace "geekiness" without actually having a solid foundation in math and physics and such. And probably it's that when I was 40 I was not _that_ much older than the people in their 20s...but now I am older than their own parents!
Whatever, I find when I talk to these newcomers with their bald heads, their piercings, their Linux geek talk, I have almost nothing in common with them.
And, as many have noted, very few of the "kids" today are libertarians (either small L or large L). This was the fertile ground Cypherpunks started in (myself, Gilmore, Stewart, Sandfort, etc., whether or not they called themselves libertarians or not).
This shows up in the fact that protests against global capitalism draw vast crowds of young people, and even several subscribers to our list have nattered on about the dangers of globalism and free trade.
In other words, politically-speaking, Cypherpunks is out of tune with what most twentysomethings seem to believe.

Nonsense. "Everyone" did not think this. Far from it. YAF was going strong back then.
Of 8 of us who rented a place, 6 were fairly extreme libertarians, one was confused but went along, and one was apolitical. (One of these guys wore a dollar sign pin and subscribed to Nathaniel Branden's newsletter.) This, was, by the way, when we were 18-20 years old.
The Libertarian Party started at about this time, in 1972, and nearly all of the volunteers, spear carriers, etc. were in their 20s. This is very well known.
(And today most of the LP volunteers and spear carriers are in their 40s and 50s. A correlation here.)
Quite likely you, as you have said you were a Marxist. I never went through such a phase, having started reading Heinlein and that crowd when I was around 11 or so. It always seemed self-evidently silly to think that "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need" could be taken seriously by anybody.
And I remember taking some cheer that day in November, 1963 when the Big Government guy was zapped. My family left the U.S. that afternoon and did not return for 13 months.
I was a Goldwater supporter in 1964, when I was 12. (Goldwater was way too liberal for me in many ways, but he was against the "Civil Rights Act" and other such Marxist nonsense, so I supported him. I didn't care for his Vietnam views, except I agreed with him we should either fight to win it very, very decisively, or get out.
Still think most of the baldies of today, with rings through their noses, marching against Coca Cola and Intel and Big Business, and arguing for affirmative action are "more libertarian"?
Again, apparently more so than you. In any case, saying "everyone thought that Ho Chi Minh was the greatest" is silly.
This is certainly so. But it doesn't dispute my point. In fact, it supports it.
My generation was very active, on all sides. The droids born after about 1980 are mainly followers. Probably what the nose rings are for.

I can imagine a bunch of possible reasons for this development. In no particular order:
* In the 1950s and 60s, the effects of Rand and Heinlein were pervasive. Many college kids in the 60s were reading "Atlas Shrugged." (I won't get into how badly it's written, except to say I devoured it in 2 days in 1968, when I was 16, and quoted from it to all who would listen in the next couple of years. But I haven't been able to read it _since_. I can't get past about page 10 before throwing it down. It's strong propaganda, but badly written.)
* The mood of the 50s and 60s was actually one of nearly boundless possibilities for the future, at least in America. Not because of socialists in Congress and JFK, but because of a booming economy, technology, and all the usual things of the time. The generation which entered the work economy in the 1960s through the early 1980s is the wealthiest generation in history...especially those who did so in Silicon Valley or similar areas.
(My implication being that things were different for the generation which came of age much later, with more of a sense of limited horizons, dead-end jobs at Starbucks making lattes for Yuppies, etc. Maybe if I were 25, working for $9 an hour at Starbucks, I'd shave my head and look like a refugee from the Apple "1984" commercial too.)
* A lot of these folks, the ones who came of age in the 60s and 70s, were enthusiastic libertarians. Some of them joined the Libertarian Party, most of them dislike government drug laws and redistribution of their income, and so on.
* A lot of the younger folks I see interviewed describe "income inequality" and "discrimination" and "globalization" as the serious problems the world and America face. They may favor drug legalization, as libertarians do, but they certainly aren't sympathetic to most laissez-faire, "survival of the fittest" libertarianism.
A couple of folks here have followed-up in this latest thread with claims that the old farts, especially me, quash discussion of new theories, new outlooks.
Hey, this is an anarchy. I have absolutely no power whatsoever to quash _anything_ related to this list!
When we were a young list, but when I was still an old fart by most standards (I was 40 in 1992), we didn't need any permission or approval to post what we wished. And some of the folks then were even older than me (Sandy Sandfort, Arthur Abraham, maybe Jude Milhon...).
And new subscribers and young people who join the list today are perfectly free to make good contributions. I recall few such newcomers, however. (One of them was Dave Molnar, now a grad student in CS/something at Berkeley, interested in many of the issues we are interested in. He was not "censored" by the old farts when he had something interesting to say.)
Bottom line is that this crap about how the old farts are suppressing the young guns is bullshit. If someone has something to say, they should say it. They may not get a positive response to calls for passing new laws to raise taxes "on the wealthy," or to break up Microsoft, or to tell people what kind of software they can write, but that's because the underlying philosophy of the list is what it is: call it libertarian, call it anarcho-capitalist, call it whatever, but don't call it "there ought to be a law" sentiment.

No, I think few topics on the Cypherpunks list are taken private.
I've had several people write to me in private, asking questions about things that came up on the list. Sometimes I reply, but usually I urge them to "stop lurking and post on the list!"
My reasons are two-fold: First, to get them to stop lurking and participate. Second, to work up the energy to compose an essay (or mini-essay, whatever), I need some motivation. I am not energetic about writing a long response to some stranger who asks me a question in private. If he posts publically, I may (or may not...) decide to use his post as a jumping-off point for something that I think needs to be As for you, I have dumped on you because most of your posts to the list look a lot like you are asking for help on a homework problem or have just semi-randomly pulled an example out of a crypto or algebra book and have decided to "participate" in the list by asking if anyone knows the answer to some puzzle.
Table shown is completed to define 'associative'
binary operation * on S={a,b,c,d}.
So can (a*d)*d=a*(d*d)=d considered as associative
over * for this case as per definition?"
If we are to convert a k-bit integer n to a base b
number,it takes us O(log n) if the base b is a power
Is there an algorithm with time complexity O(log n)
which allows such conversion to base b ,when b is not
a power of 2?"
are just two of your more recent examples.
Now if you had told us you were implementing a crypto system for use in India (where I think you are from...), and had run into a tough problem, these might be interesting for people to comment on.
But they sure do look like homework problems.
A more fruitful sort of post might be for you to discuss the general crypto situation in India, the telecom infrastructure, and Indian government attitudes. Or, if these topics don't interest you, your thoughts on implementing DC Nets, or using digital money, or whatever.
But to post snippets of problems out of textbooks is NOT participation in the topics of the list. Think about it.
I wish you no ill-will, but you should find ways to participate which suggest you are actually reading what others are saying and giving your own views or responses to them.

I'm not interested in trying to get published in "Down with WTO Times" or "Skateboard Magazine," or whatever it is that these kids are reading. (Actually, I don't think most of them do much reading. I spend a lot of time in the great bookstores in Santa Cruz--rarely do I see the "persons of piercing" leave their hangouts out on Pacific Avenue to enter the bookstores, except to try to use the restrooms.)
And the problem is not even so much with Gen X but with Gen Y, or whatever they are being called these days.
I reach who I reach. Their choice to read what I write.
I see an explosion of Blogs, the daily musings of people involved in EPIC, EFF, etc.
This is similar to the explosion of personal Web pages several years ago, when home pages had snippets of philosophy, lists of books people had read, etc.
(And perhaps just as so many of these personal Web pages fell into disrepair and were seldom looked-at by others, the wave of personal Blogs will crest and then decline in amplitude.)
So, you are free to be "Matt Gaylor, Activist!" and to try to get articles published in "Liberty" or "Gold Currency Times" or wherever you get published, but I have other things I'd rather be doing.
Preaching to me that I ought to be sacrificing my time for the betterment of some skatepunks by publishing in "Piercing Magazine" is the silliest kind of altruistic thinking.

By the way, I spent a lot of time writing and polishing an essay which Vernor Vinge and his editor wanted for his collection "True Names--and the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier." My article, "True Nyms and Crypto Anarchy" was one of the longest in the book (probably the longest, though I haven't checked) and was the best distillation of things I wanted to say. The book was delayed a couple of times, and came out several years after I expected it to, but that's the publishing world.
Frankly, this article has wider exposure than nearly anything else I could have written. The book is in bookstores everyplace I've checked, and it will be available in used copies for many years to come. I expect this is wider exposure than had I done a series of articles in Gen Y-favored mags.
And other versions of my essays have appeared in books like "Building in Big Brother" and that ilk (collections of articles and essays). These books have almost certainly reached anyone needing reaching, as if the Net and the Web were not enough.
In contrast to the situation in 1992-3, anyone even remotely interested in crypto now has ample exposure to the Cypherpunks meme. Any search entry in Google on the obvious topics will return numerous hits on articles, postings, mentions, etc. (I disagree with the claim made here today that the Cypherpunks archives need to be kept better...I find articles I want using Google, which has indexed nearly every month of every year. If their are gaps, the best approach is for sites to mirror their contents, not for any kind of formal upkeep of the archives.)
Finally, neither I nor other Cypherpunks control when some journalist will give us publicity. The wave of publicity in 1992-4 came for obvious reasons: Kevin Kelly was writing for "Whole Earth Review"on crypto and also was helping to start "Wired," so he got Steven Levy to do a cover story. A writer at "The Village Voice" saw a posting of mine on sci.crypt (saying that Trimble Navigation had just received a patent on the Pythagorean Theorem, a spoof on the wave of software and algorithm patents) and sent me e-mail. This led to his big piece on crypto and Cypherpunks. And so on.
As the Yippies of the 60s knew so well, press coverage covers breaking news, either real or by stunts. So the ""RSA in 4 lines of Perl" got a brief blurb, as did my "BlackNet" thing. Stego has gotten a couple of blurbs. No big cover stories in recent years, save for that other big stunt, the offshore gun platform used as "HavenCo.'
(And for an interesting read, see Ryan Lackey's presentation at Defcon this year--use Google of course--on how the HavenCo folks used deception to convince the reporters that HavenCo was a viable Fact is, "we" could probably get a squib in "Wired" if we pulled some stunt like showing up at the Ninth Circuit for some crypto hearing wearing gorilla suits. Newspapers and magazines like media events and good photos. It's all bullshit.
Anyone interested in crypto and liberty has a flood of information, including numerous ways to find our lists if he wants to. This was not the situation in 1992, for various obvious reasons, and at that time there was a lot of pent-up demand for the stuff. (When Eric and I called the first meeting, we already knew of a bunch of people in the Bay Area interested in the general topics...the usual suspects who had read Heinlein, Ted Nelson, Hakim Bey, who were readers of "Reality Hackers/Mondo 2000," who went to the Hackers Conference most years, who were on the Extropians list, and who knew about PGP. It was no accident that we hit the ground running.)
Me, I spend most of my technical time lately with Haskell. Not writing encryption programs--which are plentiful already in Haskell, as in many languages--but thinking about the issues I've talked about here before. In particular, using monads to implement stateful entities, the connection between continuation-passing style (CPS), capabilities (as in E), and monads. I especially admire the work of, believe it or not, a Goth follower living in the Netherlands: Frank Atanassow. And the work of John Baez, a mathematical physicist, Jeremy Butterfield, a philosopher/programmer doing an implementation of quantum logic in Clean (a close relative of Haskell), and a bunch of others.
(By the way, a company in the Beaverton, OR area called "Galois Connection" (a pun, for those who know the math) is doing a crypto library under contract to the NSA, perhaps others. Their library is written in Haskell, interestingly enough. I don't know how it compares or overlaps with Wei Dai's crypto library. But I found it interesting that that some of my own thoughts on this were already being developed by a company.)
This is a lot more interesting to me that struggling to get the current editors of "Wired" to stop thinking of crypto as "tired" and write another story about us.
Whether my current stuff "reaches" the 20-year-old dropout skatepunk and convinces him to Fight for Liberty! is not of interest to me. Nor is it my task to write the Next Great PGP Version.
Life is too short to sacrifice it for the Good of the Herd. Saying I should find ways to spread memes to the Gen Y nosering crowd is no different than the tired old idea that I should be funding worthy Cypherpunks. (Luckily, I don't hear this as much as I did around 1997-99, during the Bubble.)

You can Google Groups for any of the unique text to find it, and the  Or, here's the thread (search on my name for the exact spot, or go to  August 22nd):
Searching GG on "don frederickson got tim" is maybe more reliable than  pasting this URL.
(If you are asking did Don write this on or about the 22nd?, I assume  so, of course, as this is when this "Kal" nym was foaming and  threatening to get my account yanked and have the cops raid my house.)
It happened in one of the "movies" groups (rec.arts.current-movies),  when the thread was on DVD copy protection and the (claimed) illegality  of making DVDs of movies.
I explained how I was cheerfully making an average of a DVD a day of my  favorite current movies.
A couple of "nyms" went ballistic and foamed that they had forwarded my  "admissions" to the RIAA and how I would face civil penalties and jail  time, oh my!
Then one of them claimed he had arranged to have my account yanked, for  "violation of the DMCA." He claimed he had sent copies of my "criminal"  admissions to Got.net, to the RIAA, to "law enforcement" (shudder!),  and so on.
The owner of Got.net replied to him and the above got posted (not by  I consider Don Frederickson despicable, and stupid. To not bother  before understanding the context of the thread and say, basically,  "Yes, we have narced out this customer to law enforcement, but they are  just watching" is reprehensible.
The earlier owners/operators of Got.net took the stance that what  people said on Usenet or on mailing lists was of no interest to them,  save for a few carefully-spelled-out TOS issues (like spam).
The new owner apparently thinks it's his job to narc out his customers  to law enforcement and then to tell others who are not even his  customers that he has done so. Were I the litigious sort, I might  contemplate suing.
(I haven't quit Got.net yet mainly because I am evaluating options for  broadband in my rural location. Currently, DSL is about half a mile  away, so may arrive soon--when it does I expect I will get it.  Cablemodem is available to the top of my hill, but not down my long  driveway, and the cable company will not allow me to either string my  own lines or mount a WiFi or IR or similar atop the telephone pole. (My  utilities are underground, but were laid when the house was built,  circa 1976. No cable lines. Which is one reason I got a satellite dish,  DirecTV, shortly after moving in. And, yes, I have looked at satellite  broadband options like DirectLink...not impressive at all.)  And the  "Pringles can" approach is not something I want to spend my time  engineering or debugging.)
My hunch is that Frederickson and Got.net have been forwarding copies  of some of my e-mail to "law enforcement," which would have put them in  violation of the ECPA, except that after 9/11 and the Patriot Act and  all these actions are now considered just good corporate citizenship.

You need to read my long, long essay in "True Names," then. This is more widely available than anything I would waste my time doing for "Body Peircing" or "Skate," even if I wanted to.
As for writing for "Reason," they haven't asked, and their editorial focus is increasingly statist. Cf. Cathy Young's quote at the bottom of this post.
As for my diatribes here, the references to the archives and to how Sarath shouldn't be posting homework questions and all, well, these take very, very little of my time.
I spend much more time trying to get XEmacs to do a smarter job of recognizing Haskell keywords!
(And thinking how the integrated development environment I had nearly 20 years ago with my Symbolics Lisp Machine, with integrated debuggers, browsers, inspectors, and an editor (Zmacs) was so far ahead of anything I can now get with any combination of Emacs, XEmacs, OCaml, Mozart/Oz, or Haskell. The one good and integrated environment I have, that is not proprietary to some company, is Squeak, the Smalltalk environment. But for various reasons I am not doing Squeak at this time...lazy evaluation is the kind of executable mathematics that is where it's at, as we old farts used to say.)
More will change, and _has_ changed, by writing code than by trying to convince the nosering set that they should be learning Perl or Python. And it's not as if there isn't a vast sea of material already out there at everyone's fingertips!
One of the reasons I don't place high value on writing "new" articles anymore, unless new topics come up, is that I believe strongly that an article written a year ago, or five years ago, is just as meaningful as a "current" article (which may actually have been written earlier, pace the usual delays). This is closely-related to my reaction to people attempting to predict "future" stock prices: I'm more interested--to the extent I ever am in such schemes--in the behavior on past series, which can then be quickly tested. A subtle point, but an important one.
So if I get interested in some topic--let's pick Haskell and crypto, to stick with this example--I will spend literally several hours per day for several weeks reading from the vast number of articles and postings which have been written on the subjects. This search takes me off into a bunch of different directions.
And this is the way to do it, not get on sci.crypt and ask some question like "Hey, has anyone ever tried Haskell here?" And not getting on the Haskell mailing list and asking if anyone has every used it for crypto. The answers are already out there, possibly a few months old, but so what?
Now when we started (ObOldFartMode: On), no one had much discussed things like "the dining cryptographers problem." So people like me and Hal Finney and a few others spent many hours a week writing articles linking the problem to things like digital money and anonymous Why should any of us rewrite those same articles today?
(I also spent many thousands of hours working on the FAQ which everybody else was complaining about but which no one who volunteered to do it was either qualified to do it or was committed enough to get beyond the usual two-page kind of summary. My version, the one I chose to write, I dubbed the Cyphernomicon. It is widely available and Google has no problem finding parts of it. One need not even download and read the whole thing. Just type in something like "timed-release crypto" and off you go. Those who want it, can get it. Those who still don't know how to use Google or other engines are preterite anyway.)
I'm not sure what it is Matt thinks I need to be doing for the good of the herd. Writing a weekly column in "Newsweek" so that the great unwashed masses will learn about the importance of crypto? Writing a monthly column in "Skatepunk" or in Starbucks' in-house newsletter about prime numbers and bit commitment?
Laughable, for various reasons.
News flash: I have no desire to write on a deadline. I write when I feel like writing. And a good chunk of what I write gets spidered by Google. What can be more satisfying than that?

Indeed, the fact that James Donald starts off with the chestnut that "everyone agrees that big corporations are oppressive, blah blah" fits with his earlier comment that everyone in the 60s supported Ho Chi Minh and had posters of Che Guevarra on their walls.
Maybe in _his_ world, this was so. Many of the former leftists now on the list have claimed that they have left their leftie baggage behind...others have not even made this claim, saying they remain committed to "social justice" (a code phrase for using force to take the property of some to redistribute it to others).
I say that in most cases, "once a leftist, always a leftist." The taint of thinking in terms of "social justice" never fully leaves them, hence the nattering about "big corporations as oppressors" and "monopolies" and "fair trade, not free trade." It's just socialism in another guise.
More to the point, this shows why the libertarians and futurists who started having meetings and a mailing list as the "Cypherpunks" really do have nothing to do with the "anti-globalists" and "big corporations are oppressive" people of today. I don't recall any of the attendees in 1992 claiming they were "forced" to use Sun computers (which many of them were doing), or Unix (ditto), or Intel (some of them), or Apple (a few of us). True, we hated the software patent which had been granted to RSA, but this is an issue of patent and intellectual property issues (and software patents had just started to be granted only a few years earlier, marking a change in how things had been done for centuries in America and most of the developed world). Arguing that the RSA algorithm should not have been patentable is not the same as lefties arguing for social justice and restrictions on who one can buy or sell Intel is a very big corporation. If people don't want to buy their flash memories and support chips and microprocessors, they are not forced to. Apple is a big corporation...ditto. Microsoft is a big corporation...ditto (and yes, it is easily done...I do it). (I don't any of my work on either Intel processors or Microsoft products...I do own a copy of Microsoft Office, but I rarely use it, and could quite easily _never_ use it.)
Coca-Cola is a big, global corporation. Don't like Coke? Don't drink it. Don't like sugar being fed to kids via Coke? Mount an advertising campaign about the dangers of sugar water. Don't like the idea of Coke being introduced into China and thus corrupting a billion Chinese? The anti-globalists want governments to step in and interfere with choices. They are social planners.
And so on, with Ford, Siemens, Toyota, Daimler-Benz, Olivetti, Great Wall Computer Company, Red Hat, Costco, AMD, Aerosptatiale, Procter and Gamble, Boeing, etc.
Nattering about patents and copyright is a secondary issue. Nothing Microsoft currently "owns" as intellectual property (and I am putting "owns" in quotes because I'm not claiming that their ownership claim is either valid, is supported by anarcho-capitalists, or would survive in a strong crypto world) stops _me_ in any way from doing what I am doing. As I said, I don't use either Intel or Microsoft products. (Ironically, some government agencies now _require_ that submissions and contractees use Microsoft products! The same too-powerful government which tried to use the legal system to break up Microsoft--and only succeeded in collecting a shakedown tax of billions of dollars to be spent by the burrowcrats!--is requiring the use of MS Office. The City of Sunnyvale, to name one example, requires that all members of the public, and corporations, submitting items to City Council meetings must present them as PowerPoint files.)
Nor does Intel's 83% market share of the desktop/laptop microprocessor market stop alternatives. Intel has an 83% market share because people buy that many desktop and mobile systems. Duh. No one is holding a gun to their heads (the anti-globalist lefties, including many here on this list, argue otherwise...they are wrong). People are free to buy processors from Motorola, IBM, NEC, Fujitsu, AMD, Thompson, TI, etc. I watched Intel's competitors try to wrest control of Intel's dominance in several ways:

References: Yes, a company/corporation/enterprise is owned by its owner(s). Sometimes that owner is a single person, sometimes the owners are a family, sometimes the original owners sold pieces of ownership to other people. Sometimes the net result is that millions of individuals own small pieces of the company.
In any case, either the single owner or the small group of owners or the large group of owners then chooses some method by which decisions are reached on what products to sell, how to make them, and so on.
The difference with government is that we do not have "polycentric" governments. We have a single entity, a single "corporation," which brooks no competition, which brooks little or no "shareholder dissent."
Many here miss this point and focus on the superficial aspect that corporations typically have a hierarchy and that this hierarchy supposedly makes them like governments. Yes, in this respect. But the tens of thousands of corporations, the ability to form new partnerships, new companies, new corporations, and for some of these entities to become as large as past corporate giants, is what makes all the difference.
Having worked at the largest Silicon Valley company, I can assure you that its management methods and its corporate set up is not nearly as different from the Rest of Business as you fantasize that it is.
And being a shareholder in a bunch of non-Silicon Valley companies, I can also assure you that their 'high-level strategic decisons" are NOT "made almost entirely in the vacuum of power."
Sure, some non-SV companies make colossal mistakes. So do a lot of SV companies--I could launch into a list of the Big Errors of the past 20 years, but why bother?
History gets written by the winners. So people know about Intel, but not about AMI or Monolithic Memories or Intersil. So people know about Apple, but not about Convergent or Fortune Systems or Processor Technology. So people know about Sun, but not about Apollo or Daisy or MAD Computer.
This is silly, socialist nonsense. I know some of the book buyers at the "Borders" store in Santa Cruz (the very one that the "anti-bigness" lefties tried to ban from opening in Santa Cruz). Not only do they have a "local authors" section which is larger than the similar section at the "local" bookstore, but they have a sophisticated system for re-ordering books based on sales. If a title sells, they know it. And can order replacements.
So, what's missing? Local authors?--check. Books that sell?--check. A wider selection of books than the 'locally-owned" store?--check. The selection of books at the Borders in Santa Cruz is wider than the selection at the other bookstore. For example, history, or the Greek and Roman classics. I was looking for a book on the pre-Socratic philosophers recently (Heraclitus and that cohort). The locally-owned bookstore (which I like a lot, by the way) had a small selection of classsics, less than a shelf or two. No pre-Socratic philosophy that I could find.
So I went down the street to Borders. A floor to ceiling (well, top of their shelves, which are tall) selection of books on the Greeks and Romans, including two of the standards on the pre-Socratics, plus a couple of books just on Heraclitus.
An experience I've had many times. Borders usually has it, the smaller bookstores (in Aptos, Watsonville, Capitola, and S. Cruz) tell me "No, but we can order it for you." Gee, I can order it myself, too.
Now tell me that Borders is deficient in selection?
And the Barnes and Noble stores I sometimes go to over in the Valley are vast collections of books as well.
This is the real reason why the smaller stores are complaining. Exactly what was heard 60 years ago when "supermarkets" came to town and the small grocery stores faced competition. Exactly what was heard 30 years ago when Wal-Mart and their type came to town and the small "five and dime" stores faced competition.
Corporations have sales tracking software out the wazoo. If it sells, they buy more and sell them. Sounds like they're doing precisely what their owners want them to do.
You silly Bolshies are obviously on the wrong list if you think strong crypto is going to help your cause.

I doubt it applies to food, either.
If my local grocery store runs low on "Spam," say, they will order more. This is why they track items with POS terminals and UPC labels (largely replacing the inventory people who used to be seen in the aisles counting items and entering them into a small computer or, earlier, onto an inventory log sheet).
It makes no sense to "lump" or "consolidate" all of the stores into one lump calculation and then issue order to "send more Spam in this amount to each store." Not only does it not make sense, but clearly this would cause pileups at _some_ stores (too much Spam) and shortages at _other_ stores (still not enough Spam, even with the latest "send more Spam to all stores" order. The fact that neither shortages nor pileups (that I can see) are apparent at any of the stores I visit, and that all of them use UPC and POS methods for _all_ sales of ordered products, is consistent with the reorder method described earlier.
I repeat: the "despised by anti-capitalists" Borders store has a deeper and broader inventory of books than the "cherished by Greens and locals" locall-owned bookstore. And they also use UPC and POS and reorder books dynamically.
(For another list I've been discussing lazy evaluation languages, like Miranda and Haskell, and like Scheme can be "forced" to do, and the similarities between demand-driven evaluation of partial results and the obviously demand-driven inventory practices of modern businesses is striking. There's an essay here for some political thinker, along the lines of Phil Salin's "Wealth of Kitchens" essay drawing parallels between free markets and object-oriented systems.)

Where tax authorities get people is in the transfer _in to_ and _out of_ certain kinds of accounts, be they Cayman Island or Swiss bank accounts, whatever. The issue with opening a Swiss bank account and wiring money into it, or depositing Federal Reserve Notes into it has NOTHING to do with FRNs having serial numbers and hence being traceable. The issue is with their own reporting to the IRS (these days) and to stops in place to stop the wiring of said money or the transport of said FRNs.
What *form* the "item of value" is inside the bank, be it gold bars or Spanish doubloons or stacks of $20 bills or diamonds, is unimportant. In fact, for all intents and purposes the "item of value" inside the bank can be marks in a ledger book, which is effectively the situation (It is true that what is stored inside a bank, be it gold coins or Federal Reserve Notes, becomes important if and when enough depositors ask for their money in that particular form. But this is an issue of believing the bank does in fact store gold dust or doubloons or FRNs, not anything about the intrinsic untraceability of such things!)
In other words, any bank except for "U-Stor-It-Yourself" safe deposit systems, is basically a black box with beliefs by I/O users about how likely it is to behave according to its specifications.
That some of the gold fetishists here keep perpetuating this deep misunderstanding of the issues is...unsurprising.

Rand supported taxes for the space program and for support of big business. So, yes, she was very pinkoid.
And like Rand, you have the same delusions about what's possible and what's not.
Your notion that "a gold atom cannot be distinguished from another" has anything important to do with issues at the crypto and traceability layers is symptomatic of this delusion. Hint: the alleged traceability of Federal Reserve Notes at the serial number level has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with traceability of payments and the reasons we need digital money.
When a person deposits $10,000 and then writes a check to another person, or wires money, or withdraws cash, and so and so forth, do you think some record of the serial numbers was the means by which this transaction was traced?
Your foolish faith that "E-gold" is some significant step "because gold atoms look like all other gold atoms, because there is only one stable isotope of gold" is embematic of the delusions which the gold bugs and offshore platform silly people have.

@_subject: Compromised Remailers 
References: <5.1.0.14.2.20031214003207.029078d0
China has proposed to run remailers for use by citizens of nations with laws allowing bureaucrat search warrants (not judges, just civil servants), Patriot Acts, no-knock raids, and concentration camps at I haven't carefully looked at the current source code (if it's available) for things like "Type II Mixmaster" remailers, things which offer reply-blocks.
Certainly for the canonical Cypherpunks remailer, the store-and-forward-after-mixing remailer, the fact that the nested encryption is GENERATED BY THE ORIGINATOR means that interception is useless to a TLA. The most a TLA can do is to a) not forward as planned, resulting in a dropped message, or b) see where a particular collection of random-looking (because of encryption) bits came from and where they are intended to next go.
In particular, a TLA or interceptor or corrupted or threatened remailer operator CANNOT insert new text or new delivery instructions into packets received by his node BECAUSE HE CANNOT OPEN ANY PAYLOAD ENCRYPTED TO THE NEXT NODE. Anything he adds to the payload bits (which he can see of course, though not decrypt or make sense of) will of course make the next node see only garbage when he tries to decrypt the This process continues, in a recursive fashion.
Now of course there are some boundary conditions. If every remailer is compromised, then complete "visibility" is ensured. The sender and receiver are in a fishbowl, a panopticon, with everything visible to the TLA or attackers.
And if even a fraction of the remailers are compromised, then with collusion they can map inputs to outputs, in many cases. (How many they can and how many they can't are issues of statistics and suchlike.)
Another boundary condition is when a remailer network is lightly used, or when correlations between sent messages, received messages, and actions take place. A signal recovery problem, perhaps akin to some military sorts of problems.
(Note that this "few users" problem is essentially isomorphic to "compromised remailers." And if the TLAs are the dominant users of remailers, sending dummy messages through, they get the same benefits as when their are few users or compromised remailers. For example, if the typical mix "latency" is 20 messages, and TLAs account for 98% of the traffic through remailers, then it's easy to calculate the Poisson probability that they can trace the only message that is NOT theirs. And so on.)
Most of these problems go away when the number of remailers is large, the number of independent users is large, and the remailers are scattered in multiple jurisdictions, making it hard for the TLAs to enforce or arrange collusion.
Another "trick" of use in _some_ of the boundary conditions is to "BE A REMAILER." This gives at least one node, namely, oneself, which is presumably not compromised (modulo black bag attacks, worms, that sort of stuff). And one could pay others to operate remailers with trusted code. (No disk Linux computers, for example, as discussed by several here over the years..)
Finally, most of these issues were obvious from the very beginning, even before Cypherpunks. When I proposed the "quick and dirty" remailers in the first Cypherpunks meeting, the ones we emulated in our Games, it was with the full awareness of David Chaum's "untraceable e-mail" paper of 1981 (referenced in the handout at the first meeting). And of his later and more robust DC Net paper of 1988, further developed by the Pfitzman team around that time.
The Chaum/Pfitzman/et. al. DC-Net addresses the collusion problem with novel methods for doing, effectively, zero knowledge proofs that some bit has bit been entered into a network without any traceability as to who entered it. (Chaum uses 3 people at a restaurant, using a scheme involving coins and parity and selective disclosure with some neighbors to show that it can be proved that one of a group paid the bill, but not which one.).
Adding reply-block capability significantly raises the risks for traceability, in my opinion. I am not casting doubt on the Anonymizer and on Mixmaster Type N (whatever is current), but I have not seen much detailed discussion here on the Cypherpunks list, and I am unaware of peer-reviewed papers on the cryptographic protocols being used. (If they exist, pointers here would be great to have!)
When I did the BlackNet demonstration, conventional Cypherpunks remailers were used for the sending of a message to a recipient, who might be a true name, might be a nym, whatever. Replies were handled with message pools, i.e., sending another message via remailers to a place that is widely visible (a Democracy Wall sort of thing) such as a Usenet newsgroup. The newsgroup alt.anonymous.messages was created around that time, as I recall, and served well.
This was not a "reply-block" approach, just the basically clean approach of nesting payloads, a la conventional encrypted Cypherpunks remailers. For a significant fraction of messages through remailers, replies are not even needed. When replies are needed, message pools.
Note: From 1988-93 I bought the Crypto Proceedings, some of the Eurocrypt proceedings, etc. I even attended some of the conferences. I followed who was doing what. For various reasons, my interest in the guts of crypto declined. Others were following developments, fortunately. But I haven't looked at a Crypto Proceedings volume in several years, so I'm out of touch with what researchers are publishing about mixes and untraceability. I'm relatively confident that the points above are general enough to be unchanged, whether the Newest Name is "Onion Routing" or "Crowds" or whatever.

Some people think spinning off new lists whenever they get interested in some area is interesting. Most of these lists fail for obvious reasons. Sometimes a famous person, especially Net famous, creates a vanity list. Hence the "Interesting People" vanity list. This trend seems to be giving way to Blogs, however, as the various net.personalities realize that what they really want is a forum for blogging their message to an attentive audience.

I worked inside a Faraday cage in a physic lab for several months. And, later, I did experiments in and around Faraday cages. Shielding is fairly easy to measure. (Using portable radios and televisions, or even using the Software-Defined Radio as a low-cost spectrum analyzer.)
My advice? Skip all of the nonsense about building special laptops or computers and special displays with mesh grids over the displays. Those who are _casually_ interested will not replace their existing Mac Powerbooks or Dell laptops with this metal box monster.
Instead, devise a metal mesh bag that one climbs into to use whichever laptop is of interest. To reduce costs, most of the bag can be metallized fabric that is not mesh, with only part of it being mesh, for breathability. (Perhaps the head region, to minimize claustrophobia and to allow audio and visual communication with others nearby.)
I would imagine a durable-enough metallized fabric bag could be constructed for under a few hundred dollars, which is surely cheaper for most to use than designing a custom laptop or desktop.
Or consider heads-up LCD glasses. These have been available for PCs and gamers for a few years (longer in more experimental forms, of course, dating back to the VR days of the late 80s). Sony has had a couple of models, and so have others. Some have video resolutions (PAL, NTSC), some have VGA resolutions. Perfectly adequate for displaying crypto results and requesting input.
These very probably radiate little. But of course a lightweight hood, a la the above mesh bag, would drop the emissions by some other goodly amount of dB. Experiments necessary, of course.
Interface to a laptop or PC could be as you described it, with shielded cables. Or just use a small PC (Poqet, etc.) and move the keyboard and CPU under the draped hood. Leakage out the bottom, hence the earlier proposal for a full bag, like a sleeping bag.

They start to identify themselves with Perl, as if Perl were part of their body, or vice versa.  They're part of the Big Perl Tribe.  They want other people to join the Tribe.

I, and many others, were against the war in Vietnam without being supporters of Ho Chi Minh or the Soviets or anyone of that ilk.

Rescuing the Jews from their folly of spinning their dreidels and twirling their sidelocks was a particularly heinous moral hazard....they had been in favor of victim disarmament for centuries prior to the so-called Holocaust and their liquidation was predictable. For the American government to send boys to Europe to die to "liberate" Europe was one of the great crimes of the last century.
All of America's "alliances" have either been based on one-sided use of force (the USA always goes to fight in foreign lands, they never come here to help us fight our battles with the negroes and Mexicans) or have been based on corporate interests (oil companies, manufacturers wishing to expand into dangerous countries, etc.).
"Not my problem" is what the libertarian sentiment embodies. General Motors wants to set up a factory in Eritrea? Let them hire a private army, not use American cannon fodder. Squibb wants to sell baby formula in Paraguay? Intel wants to open a plant in mainland China? The answers are all the same: the U.S. armed forces are not "clearing operations" for corporations or do-gooders.

There is in fact a _very_ important difference, one you should think carefully about: the issue of force.
In Germany, men with guns arrest those who sing songs which are not PC. I have no such power to use force to arrest those who use words I don't This is the essence of liberty. It's all about the initiation of force, versus free choice.
In a free system, those who don't want to see swastikas or here "prejudiced" speech will take steps to avoid concerts where such symbols or words are used, will use the "OFF" switch on their radios and televisions when such symbols or speech appears, and will avoid visiting Web sites which offend them. Choice. And responsibility.
They may even hire others to act as watchdogs or censors to screen material which may offend them. This is what ratings systems are all about. And closed communities. And voluntary associations.
However, in a free society they may not use guns or force to stop what other people are reading or viewing or singing.

I never went through a Marxist phase, never even came close. This despite entering college in 1970, this despite going to a school where the dominant paradigm was leftist (UC Santa Barbara).
I occasionally wonder what my perspective might be had I ever held leftist, collectivist thoughts. Oh well, I'll never know.
Thirty years ago I _was_ more charitable about the various groups which claim to have been aggrieved, and I dutifully referred to negroes as "blacks," argued earnestly with doubting leftists about the importance of the profit motive, cited semi-leftists who had reasonable things to say about capitalism and liberty and the Constitution.
But over the years, as I have seen a huge chunk of money taken from me at gunpoint and given to welfare skanks, inner city negro mutants, gay activist buttfucker San Francisco queer groups, foreign nations with dictators like Hussein (both of them), Mubarek, Amin, Meir, Rabin, and a hundred others, and as education has declined while the pigeons demand more handouts...I have become what I call a "vengeance While certain theoreticians of 30 years argued for silly ideas about how how it is "immoral" to land on another's balcony while falling from a building, because the property rights had not been negotiated, and thus argued that even self-defense is fraught with moral problems, another camp of us were developing the idea that vengeance is good, that crypto anarchy will not only let some of us "withdraw from the system," a la Galt's Gulch, but also it will let us execute justice on those who stole from us.
For every negro welfare momma who took money for the past number of years, tell her to pay it all back, with compounded interest, or face time in a labor camp to repay what she stole. And if she cannot, or will not, which is ovewhelmingly likely, harvest her organs (if any takers can be found) and send the leftovers up the smokestacks.
Ditto for the queers who have collected "public health" funds to pay for their sodomy. (I have no issue with their choices of partners, except that the diseases they contract via their habits, and their inability to work, is their problem, not mine. And not any corporations, except by the choice of that corporation.)
Vengeance libertarianism is the rational kind. It will result in 20-40 million of the leeches, the bums, the minority grifters, the so-called aggrieved, the winos, the addicts, all being sent up the chimneys.
Hitler had only minor reasons to go after the Jews (many of them had manipulated the economy to favor Jews while also preaching a "no defense" loser strategy to their untermenschen), we have much more reason to go after the tens of millions of underpeople who have been using their thugs in government to steal from us. We have much more justification today to liquidate the parsites than Hitler ever had.
As for government, I estimate that 99% of those in Congress and government agencies in the past 40 years have earned killing. Of current Congressvarmints, only two seem to be not guilty. Of low-level employees, a bunch are just willing dweebs, and may be able to work off their debts in a labor camp for a decade or two. But probably the cleaner solution is just to do a thermonuclear cauterization of the region surrounding Washington and start fresh from there with a very limited government that honors the Constitution instead of catering to negroes and queers and welfare addicts.

Utter nonsense. A corporation paying 45% of its profits in tax (not to mention similar high tax rates on tens of thousands of its employees) gets little or nothing "back" from the state.
Contrast this to the growing number of "on disability" scams, "services" recipients, welfare of various sorts, and general incentives not to work or save.
My state, California, has very high income and investment taxes, and very high local and property taxes...and yet the taxes can't keep up with the giveaways to bums, winos, unwed mothers, queers, beggars, "disabled," and general layabouts. And the state even makes it illegal to hire people for day jobs (without filling out numerous forms, submitting reports to Cal-OSHA, SSA, etc.).
Meanwhile, in our many Mexican towns here in California, unwed Mexican mamas push their baby strollers down to La Famiglia and WICC to get their "benefits."

As with most past "minorities"--Irish, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, etc.--they buckled down and worked their butts off, often living 5-10 to an apartment, saving for the day when they could buy their own house.

I prefer NOT to use language like "a raising tide lifts all ships," as it essentially endorses the pragmatist view supporting capitalism.
Rather, I favor the fundamentalist view that if Alice and Bob make a transaction, be it a trade of goods or labor or whatever, it is not right/wise/proper/constitutional to take some fraction of the alleged profit to give to someone else. It is "redistribution" that I am mostly arguing against, for multiple reasons. (Including the corrosive effects of teaching a growing fraction of the population that they are "entitled" to things.)
I don't claim this is a "right" implicit in the fabric of space-time, or handed down by Moloch or YHWH or some other supernatural myth-figure. Rather, societies which have taken money from workers to give to others to sit at home and breed or eat Doritos while watching Oprah have failed.
Jamestown was a recent example, with the initial settlers adopting the usual "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need" arrangement. It failed miserably, as various settlers found good reasons--exhaustion, the hot sun, to much to drink the night before, sex, or just laziness--to not show up for work parties. This meant those working had to work even harder. A vicious circle, much like the one now facing American industry, where more and more workers are claiming bogus "disability" and where the insurance costs are driving companies out of the country. And where some ethnic communities treat those who work and study as "suckas," as "Oreos."
Jamestown's solution was a harsh one: "no work, no eat."
This sounds harsh ("what about cripples?"), but it's basically the only stable attractor, in a Schelling point sense, that exists, along with the other attractor, where a growing percentage are not working, on disability, on unemployment, etc. and the remaining workers are carrying a heavier and heavier burden.
This Schelling point analysis applies to a lot of our so-called "rights," as with religious expression (where the non-coercion principle is that neighbors will come to a "territorial boundary" arrangement not to interfere with the religious views of each other, as dogs might reach a territorial boundary arrangment with other dogs.
So the issue is not "a rising tide lifts all ships" as the defense of capitalism, the issue is one of stable attractors.
That this lifts all ships is because, as Jamestown learned, having nearly all able-bodied people working to grow crops and make things and trade is, for nearly all involved, better than having 30% of the workforce slaving away in the hot sun so that 70% can find excuses not to be working.
That is not a stable attractor. "They pretend to pay us and we pretend to work."
People like Tyler Durden, James Donald, and John Young are using the tired old cliches about how it is "society that paid for business" and hence "society" has some right to take a cut of each transaction between Alice and Bob.

I haven't heard about any meetings since several months ago, so  maybe they're not even happening up in SF or Berkeley, anyway.)

Every day brings new reports of surveillance plans, suspensions of the  Constitution, more statism.
I think people are anesthetized, a la the boiling frog, to the  developing statism.
(Side note, worthy of a longer article: It may be literally a  generational thing, as libertarianism tended to be. The anti-state  "activists" of the 70s and 80s were influenced by the antiwar movement  of the 60s, but were still somewhat libertarian. Many had read  Heinlein, Rand, Rothbard, Hayek. The early Cypherpunks folks were  generally conversant with the ideas, and receptive. I conjecture that  the "new crop" is more into body piercings, skin art, and  anti-globalism (when it comes to corporations and trade, but not when  it comes to world government). In other words, Cypherpunks is like  several other Baby Boom "degenerating research program.")
I would predict that things are getting more statist and are coming to  some kind of head. Except, why bother making any predictions? Robert  Hettinga would make some snarky comment about my track record for  predictions and Duncan Frissell would gush about how things are more  free than ever, that the Perpetual Tourist need not worry about  surveillance, tracking, new laws, and restrictions on movement.

U.S. Develops Urban Surveillance System
Wed Jul  2, 1:46 AM ET
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON -  Police can envision limited domestic uses for an urban  surveillance system the Pentagon (news - web sites) is developing but  doubt they could use the full system which is designed to track and  analyze the movement of every vehicle in a city.
  Dubbed "Combat Zones That See," the project is intended to help the  U.S. military protect troops and fight in cities overseas.
  Scientists and privacy experts say the unclassified technology also  could easily be adapted to keep tabs on Americans.
  The project's centerpiece would be groundbreaking computer software  capable of automatically identifying vehicles by size, color, shape and  license tag, or drivers and passengers by face.
  The proposed software also would provide instant alerts after  detecting a vehicle with a license plate on a watchlist, or search  months of records to locate and compare vehicles spotted near terrorist  attacks, according to interviews and contracting documents reviewed by  The Associated Press.
  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which develops  technologies for fighting 21st century wars, is overseeing the project.
  Scientists and privacy experts  who have seen face-recognition  technology used at a Super Bowl and monitoring cameras in London  are  concerned about the potential impact of the emerging DARPA technologies  if they are applied to civilians by commercial or government agencies  outside the Pentagon.
  "Government would have a reasonably good idea of where everyone is  most of the time," said John Pike, a Global Security.org defense

No RTOS/Linux is needed for fast sampling, which has been happening for several decades now.  Nor is a digital oscilloscope needed.
(FWIW, I used a Nicolet digital oscilloscope, and also a LeCroy CAMAC digitizer, for some high-speed single-shot event capture--the strike of an alpha particle--nearly 25 years ago. The OS for our data collection computers were, variously, RSX-11M and VMS.)
Video ADC cards are already vastly capable at sampling video streams.
So? Yes, this is all possible. Any moderately well-equipped lab can do this. So?
I have no idea what you mean by "fill this idea with water," but by all means go ahead and rig up such a machine.
Personally, I already make about 1-2 recordable DVDs per day, on average, without any hint of copy protection or Macrovision. I usually use the 3-hour speed on my DVD recorder, and can put one high-quality movie on the first part and then, by using a slightly slower speed, another movie on the remaining part. If "DVD quality" is needed, I record at the 2-hour setting. If "better than DVD quality" is needed, as from a DV camcorder source, I record at the 1-hour speed.
If you build a machine which has even higher digitization rates, taken ahead of any DVD spec circuitry, you will get about what I am getting at the 1-hour setting.
A very limited market for consumers to buy such machines. Video pirate labs very probably already have such rigs set up.

No, it was NOT "all supposed to be a big pool that we would draw on when needed." You seem to be confusing medical insurance with nationalized social medicine.
Do I really need to explain this concept here, to subscribers here?
Medical insurance is a risk arbitrage betting scheme just like all other insurance: the actor selling a policy (a contract) is making the bet that he will make more money than he pays out. If he finds out something that alters the expectation of some illness or disease or hazardous activity, then he adjusts the policy premiums accordingly (or even refuses to sell a policy at any price, for understandable reasons).
By the way, any scheme to force everyone into the same insurance pool for the same premiums is profoundly antiliberty and is unconstitutional (violates all sorts of rights). "Opting out" of coverage is always fair. If I know I am not a rock climber, why would I pay for coverage for rock climbing falls? And if I know I am not engaging in queer sex or IV drug use, why would I pay for AIDS coverage/
(There are interesting scenarios for private testing for various genes or proclivities, followed by opting-out for the diseases one is highly unlikely to contract. This kind of "not paying for what you don't use" is a form of cherry-picking which only a total state could outlaw. Think about it.)

Medical insurance, car insurance, life insurance, home insurance, boat insurance, etc., are all just variations on a theme.
When AAA Insurance meets with Joe Sixpack to discuss his health or life or earthquake insurance, they seek to collect enough information to have a reasonable chance of turning a profit on the deal. Else why would they exist as a business?
They likely never have complete information, about fault lines, or fire hazards, or unhealthy behavior, but they can manage their risks reasonably well by standard statistical sampling and actuarial data I won't waste my time further arguing your "medial insurance is different" point until you show you have some basic grounding in how the real economy works and can explain why you think medical insurance is somehow exempt from the normal profit/loss considerations.
Saying that health care is important is not enough. It's just another purchased service, after all.
First, I pay for my own such needs out of my own pocket. Many firms and well-off individuals are "self-insured." Insurance is not something magical, it's just a set of tradeoffs of risk and ability to pay. For those who cannot possibly raise the $100K for a seldom-needed operation, paying $5000 a year in premiums _may_ make sense. Because they perceive the consequences of not having the money to buy the operation, despite its unlikelihood, to be worth the payment each year. And so on, for a range of scenarios.
Second, if I wished to have insurance I would buy it.
That's how I would get x-rays or chemotherapy.
Saying that because I do not share your views about socialized insurance I must plan on making my own x-ray machine or brewing my own cancer chemicals is not only silly, it is disingenuous.
You're further gone than I thought.

Sure, this is what "price discovery" is all about, in many contexts and in many markets. "Reasoning with incomplete information" is the basis for just about everything. Animals reason without complete information, insurance companies reason without complete information, we all do.
I don't claim either party in an insurance contract knows the future, or even knows the probabilities of things happening.
Knowing a lot about DNA still doesn't mean the future is known...when or if pregnancies will occur, when or if a fall from a cliff will occur, or, obviously, when some rare disease will appear.
Insurers already seek maximum information. This is their "right" (in the sense that the signing of an insurance contract is a mutually uncoerced transaction).
As I said, many corporations choose to self-insure. Partly because they can carry the costs of coverage of rare events themselves, partly because they have excellent estimates of what ranges of events are likely to occur.
Insurance has been in a process of evolutionary learning and better estimation for decades, even centuries. It shows no signs of going away. In fact, better estimation of risks has generally led to more and more refined kinds of insurance, even niche market insurance. Let me give an example:
A friend of mine just told me that his very elderly parents had to be flown home, with a medical attendant, from St. Petersburg, Russia to San Francisco. I don't know the full details, as his comment was in an e-mail message, but I know his parents were on some kind of Baltic Sea cruise. My friend said the emergency flight home was very expensive, but that his father had for the first time purchased "trip insurance," so the costs are covered. This kind of insurance didn't exist in the 1950s, that's for sure.
More information means someone thinks they can make a buck making a certain kind of bet. Sometimes they bet wrong, except betting wrong is part of the scheme.
The larger issue is that these transactions be uncoerced.
The crypto significance may be a bit abstract, but it's related to selective disclosure of information, e.g., uncovering one of a series of covered coins, or showing a hand of cards. Alice and Bob play various games, sometimes buying disclosure of bits of information. "All crypto is economics" is just another way of saying the world and people in it do not have perfect information about the state of others, about their intents, about the future.
Both investors and actuaries are in the business of trying to estimate and predict better than others.

Agreed, many options for directly grabbing the data.
However, most people don't care about minor analog stages. Audiophiles and videophiles are not the primary consumers of this stuff, as evidenced by the mountains of MP3s not even sampled as well as they could be (64 kbps being the norm) and by the DIVX files shipped around the Web. And videos 10x-compressed to fit on CD-Rs. The people bootlegging CDs and DVDs are not usually the people with the 40-inch plasma screens.
Video pirates in Asia routinely use covert camcorders to grab weird-ass angles of first-run movies. And their DVD stall customers cheerfully pay them the equivalent of two dollars for their DVDs. Compared to this, sampling from an analog signal is heaven.
I have my own collection of about 30 DVD+Rs, each containing 1-2 full-length videos. By the end of this year, I should have several hundred movies added to my collection.
The video quality is perfectly fine for me, and I like good quality. Until I move to HDTV and blue ray DVD, the quality is excellent. And even with HDTV and blue ray, so long as component video connections (a la progressive scan cables) are available, nearly perfect sampling will still be easy to do.
(Which is why Hollywood would like the HDTV sets to be sealed, with only digital inputs. Except that they tried this trick with twiddling with the specs of past HD generations. A lot of HDTV receivers and monitors are already out there, and changing the spec yet again and making the suckers, er, "early adopters," have to scrap their systems is not going to go over very well.)

I've owned an "Audio Alchemy" SCMS-stripper since 1991, when I bought my first DAT machine. It cost about $99, was about the size of a deck of cards, and stripped the SCMS bits out of the digital bitstream.
A later DAT machine I bought, a Tascam portable pro deck, has the SCMS stripped by default. (It takes in digital signals and writes to the DAT with the SCMS code set to "unlimited number of digital copies allowed.")
Likewise, a professional CD writer I own (HHB) bypasses SCMS. (Not just allowing a digital copy to be made, but making the resulting CD-R copyable freely.)
A friend of mine bought his DVD player on EBay: it bypasses all region coding (i.e., it makes all DVDs "region-free"). Region coding is a different issue, but part of the DRM universe.
Until George W. Bush and the Carlyle Group start putting money into these things and thus discover that SCMS strippers are terrorist tools, such tools will likely continue to be available.

The harshness of a digital bitstream can be softened by operating LED clocks in the same room as the bitstream. The Tice Clock, for example, works by plugging in to any electrical socket in the room where the listener is located...of course, all that matters is that he _sees_ the Tice Clock plugged-in, and remembers that he paid $399 for this piece of wondrous technology, for the effect to work.
That the bitstream as measured with a logic analyzer is unchanged with any of these "digital enhancers" is beside the point.
Monster Cable, by the way, is doing a nice business selling Extra Special, Oxygen-Free Copper Shielded, Insulated with Rubber Hand-Rolled on the Thighs of Taiwanese Virgins cables for _USB_. Yep, for USB. Never mind that the bitstream either is there or it isn't...some people think they get superior data with special $80 cables.
As for hearing heterodyning in 28 KHz and 30 KHz signals, maybe. CD players have brickwall filters to of course block such frequencies. Some analog groove-based systems can have some kind of signal up there at those frequencies, but not much. Very, very few microphones are rated at 22-25 KHz, so I have to wonder just where this signal is coming from. If not coming from actual musical instruments, and detected by the microphones, why bother?
Sure, we may as well push the CD spec up to 24 KHz or so. That will probably even satisfy Neil Young.

Yes, they are real. I perhaps should have inserted a "this is not a joke," but I didn't think to.
When I was the judge in the First Internet Witch Trial, one of the examples I used was how believing something doesn't make it so, despite what the believers think (though the psychological effects may be real). An example being some audiophile nonsense, such as the Tice Clock (which is/was also real...some people bought the snake oil about how an LED clock plugged in could "soften the harshness of digital." With the Tice Clock, with the Monster USB cables, one can examine the effects on bit error rates, and even look at timing jitter (a claim some manufacturers of snake oil make). For any of us with a remotely scientific bent, seeing that the bitstream is unchanged, that the bit error rate is unchanged, is pretty convincing evidence that no matter what we _think_ we hear, especially in non-double blind listening tests, there simply _is_ no difference.
And yet there are people who claim to hear differences between 5 dollar digital cables and thousand dollar digital cables, even when the bitstreams are identical. (And even if they are not, they are within the capture window of the next digital gadget, and hence are for all intents and purposes absolutely identical.)
One might as well sell "Monster Cable Power Cords for PCs," claiming they make the Pentium 4 "perform more accurately." Actually, I'll bet the tweaks are already buying special power cords for their Athlon 2200+ homebrews.
Most so-called high end tube amps do in fact sound different, perhaps "better," perhaps not. This is of course because tubes are usually rich in odd-order harmonics. That $4000 Krell tube amp is actually _coloring_ the sound. So much for 20-bit DACs in the signal source: the amp is altering the sound at about the 6th or 8th or whatever most significant bit.
Bob Carver and a few others have "emulated the tube sound" so well with DSPs that double-blind tests  using audiophiles cannot tell the difference, and where the waveforms look identical.

@_subject: MRAM, persistance of memory 
We were reading remnant state information in DRAMs back in the mid-70s. When a DRAM is powered back up after some period without power there are "remnants" which are not really electrons (which thermalize into the substrate in a matter of microseconds) but which cause "preferential turn-on or turn-off" in the cells, due to shifts in threshold voltage. (This is why irradiation of the DRAMs with gammas can sometimes "freeze" the stored data pattern.)
Intel was the inventor of DRAM and we led the market (along with Mostek) for most of the 1970s. We had some really cool tools for seeing the internal states of DRAMs, before, during, and after things we did to the devices. Powering them off and watching the states they came back up in was child's play.
This effect, of seeing DRAMs "wake up" in preferred states, is a very subtle effect. And no doubt it varies amongst vendors and even between design and process steppings of the same vendor's part.
I would not want to be the forensic data analyst trying to do this, but I expect sometimes they do. The "recover data from voice answering machines" gadget is no doubt much lower tech. Most answering machines are battery-backed (duh), so a forensics expert can keep power maintained and even use the battery-backed store to keep the DRAMs nominally refreshed.
But I thought most modern answering machines which don't use tapes are in fact using flash, not DRAMs. Am I wrong on this? Flash is of course an entirely different story.

Thinking about this brief comment, I assume MV means sealing a PC to make black bag opening more apparent.

A dab of sealing wax (available in most stationery stores, save for Staples, Office Depot, OfficeMax, Paper Barn, StaplerWorld, Nothing But Rubber Bands, and other warehouses masquerading as stationery stores) over the side panels and other access points, even over the floppy and CD-ROM ports (carefully!), and a distinctive signet ring or other such seal-making device could be quite easy to use.
(As we all know, CIA and other spook agency "flaps and seals" specialists are well-versed in duplicating such seals...but probably only after collecting good information. An FBI black bag job is likely to encounter the sealing wax and seal and be unable to duplicate it. There may be tools now to take a fairly good impression, perhaps with a fast-setting polymer, and then make a convincing duplicate of the seal. All crypto is economics, though, and simple seals probably work against most attackers.)

Several good suggestions in this thread about securing machines and keyboards against FBI black bag jobs and the like.
(By the way, the USB flashdrive (a 256 MB FlashHopper) I have on my keychain--my physical keychain!--is probably waterproof. The USB port has a little plastic cover which slides on snugly. Until I eventually misplace it, I am using it. I expect the thing is showerproof, though I don't intend to test it. Water resistance can be tested nondestructively with things like Fluorinert, of course. Also, surfers and kayakers often have O-ring sealed gizmos they wear under their wet suits, coming in different sizes. It would be trivial to find one to hold either a USB flashdrive or a Compact Flash card.)
The larger issue is a business/consulting opportunity:
The collection of "lore" on resisting bugs and intercepts and bad security measures is not something the average Mafioso or freedom fighter is much interested in learning himself. Just as specialists are used to sweep rooms for bugs, the same should apply to helping Vito Corleone beef up his computer system.
"Have LAN, will Travel." Security Consultants, Inc. will provide you, your family, and your associates with a computer and communications package which is resistant to FBI or CIA wiretaps, black bag jobs, Van Eyck interception, and remote surveillance. We will evaluate your current system, your needs, and design a system for you. This will included throwaway cellphones, easy to use but robust encryption, steganography, access to offshore accounts, physical security for the computers, digital dead drops, use of untraceable remailers, personal security devices (such as USB flash drives storing sensitive material), and set up of t.v. cameras under your control for monitoring snooping, intrusion, and even dishonest associates and family. Security Consultants does not currently handle weapons issues, but all your other bases are belong to us.
I mean this somewhat whimsically, but the fact is that this kind of security consulting will become more and more important as even mobsters move into the information age. (When I was developing some of the ideas prior to the formation of Cypherpunks, one of the interesting news items was about how a guy on the run from the Feds was using an early bulletin board system--I think it was GEnie, but it may have been Prodigy--to communicate with his wife in chat rooms.)
In a free society, those who provide services like roofing or plumbing or security needs are of course not implicated in the  possible crimes or other activities of their customers. A guy who builds a security fence for Don Corleone is not guilty of aiding and abetting.
But we have not had a free society for many decades, and it is more than possible that RICO and Espionage statutes would be interpreted by government to say that assisting someone like Aldrich Ames in improving his tradecraft is ipso facto part of a conspiracy.
Or the spooks could demand that Security Consultants, Inc. place "special" networks and cameras...
Issues of trust and fear. (When the Mob finds out this has been done and snatches one of the children of the company and returns the child as a "turkey," with both arms, both legs, the nose, the ears, and the tongue precisely and surgically removed, others in the industry may realize the dangers of crossing the Mob.)

We've talked many times about using laptops, heads-up displays (like the Sony glasses), and even putting mesh bags over a user and his laptop. Actual Faraday cage rooms are not really needed.

Soap and water is often used for cleaning bare PCBs, but this is long before the chips go in.
After wave soldering (PCBs fed on conveyer belt above hot solder bath, soldering the devices to the board in one continuous process) the flux and dross and gunk is washed off with special soaps (e.g., high acid content soaps) and water. But the water is certainly not left on the boards, not left to dry and cause spotting, etc.

This continuing confusion, by many people, about what "digicash" is shows the problem with using nonspecific terms.
In fact, "digicash" strongly suggests David Chaum's "Digicash," not some name for all forms of credit cards, ATMs, debit cards, PayPal, wire transfer, Mondex, and a scad of other systems that may use bits and electronic signals.
Conventionally, on this list and in the press about "digital cash," digital cash means something which has the untraceable and/or anonymous features of "cash" while being transferred digitally. It is NOT a Visa system or a PayPal account or a wire instruction to the Cayman Islands.
I choose not to call "untraceable/anonymous digital cash" by any of the marketing-oriented catchwords like "Digicash," "BearerBucks," "E-coins," "MeterMoney," whatever.
So, I strongly agree with your point that not all electronic forms of money need to be anonymous (untraceable) in order to be useful. HOWEVER, our interest is in the untraceable/anonymous. There are no doubt active groups discussing PayPal, VISA, MasterCard, DiscoverCard, etc. But they have nothing to do with Cypherpunks.
We should also fight the use of sloppy language in the press when mundane electronic funds transfer systems are called "digital cash."

Agreed, making the assumption that readers here have heard of Chaum or understand the basic idea of blinded transactions (or dining cryptographers, or oblivious transfer, or any of the other building blocks) is no longer warranted. I expect many of the persyns of peircing now spewing on the list are, like, thinking "that's, like, _so_ nineties."
As for thinking very general readers or listeners, those not even on the list, are capable of understanding Chaum or Digicash, that's a fool's errand. The average nontechnical person knows nothing about how crypto works, and attempting to explain a DC-Net or a blinded transfer is no more useful to them than just telling them the currency is based on "magic beans."
The point is not that laymen need to understand Digicash, but that calling things like ATM cards and Visa cards "digicash" does a disservice to the important ideas of why Chaum's and Brands' and similar systems worked.
Hey, maybe it's actually the case that some of the people here who are referring to electronic debit cards as "digicash" just don't have a clue about what blinding is and why it makes for truly untraceable I stopped any efforts to explain the true importance of electronic/digital money/cash a long time ago. A waste of time. Not too surprising, as getting even the basic idea requires some passing familiarity with things like how RSA works. When I read Chaum's 1985 CACM paper I already knew about RSA and "hard" directions for problems (trapdoor functions), and yet I still had to read and reread the paper and draw little pictures for myself.
Thinking someone can absorb the gist via a purely verbal description is just not plausible. I have seen David Chaum attempt to do this with an audience of computer professionals....my impression from the later questions from the audience is that his explanation simply didn't get them over the "hump" to the stage of realizing the key concept. No more so than popularizations of relativity actually ever got the masses to understand relativity.
There is much that could be said about whether this difficulty is why we don't have untraceable, Chaum-style forms of money (I don't think this is the reason). Regardless, wishing won't make it so, and so wishing that people would "grok" the importance of blinding without having spent at least a few hours brushing up on RSA and exponentiation and all that and then following an explanation very, very closely....well, wishing won't make it so.
So it's best to ignore the "unwashed masses" and their inability to understand untraceable money.
More troubling is that so many _here_ don't seem to "get it."

So I have altered the They may have _heard_ of it, but to most of them (I t hink) it's just some magical incantations which they don't quite believe anyway.
First, my "stopped any efforts...a long time ago" was a comment directed at what the OP was talking about: explaining digital money to the masses. For example, at parties or other meatspace gatherings. Online explanations--here, for example--are another matter.
Second, the many online explanations from the CP list, circa 1992-94, are readily findable. Let me go check....(20 seconds pass...)...yep, I just found hundreds of summary articles from various authors, including myself, Eric Hughes, Hal Finney, Doug Barnes, Ian Goldberg, and many others. There is no shortage of explanations of this stuff.
In one of my articles, in fact, I make the same point about how the various boring versions of "electronic money" are not very important:
"The focus here is on true, untraceable digital cash, offering both payer and payee untraceability (anonymity). Mundane digital money, exemplified by on-line banking, ATM cards, smartcards, etc., is not interesting or important for CFP purposes. Payer-untraceable (but payee-traceable) digital cash can also be interesting, but not nearly as interesting and important as fully untraceable digital cash. "
There are many articles on why this is so. But, frankly, anyone who cannot see this from first principles probably is not ever going to get Third, regarding the CACM article, it's been "liberated" and made available online more than a few times. Try search engines. I know the Information Liberation Front (ILF) was actively liberating various of the key papers in the early months of the CP list...and these are mostly archived and searchable.
And of course Chaum's original 1985 description has been redone many times, in later papers by him and others, etc.
As it's been demonstrated to work, technically, this is a weird statement. Existence proofs are powerful.
If you mean that Bank of America and Mastercard are not offering Chaum-style instruments, and so on, then this is not the same thing as saying the ideas don't work.

My analysis of the situation is that the peak creative years for CP ideas were 1992-95, and virtually no one on the list was being paid a cent for their efforts here or elsewhere. Some were students, some were libertarians with pent-up ideas about creating actual free societies or economies, some were engineers or programmers working for companies on unrelated projects, some were unemployed.
The dot com era was actually a desert era...lots of nattering about raising VC money, buying other companies, creating grandiose plans to become rivals to Microsoft, and so on. Very few really good ideas in the 1996-00 era. And then came the crash.
We haven't had much of an infusion of young blood--I believe this is closely related to Boomers and Heinlein, Rand, etc. and the differing interests of the young people of today and their anti-globalist, ring through nose politics--and those who got wiped out in the dot com frenzy have not gone back to blue sky thinking.

The move to "boycott stores selling sweatshop products" is gathering steam, so to speak. Stores like The Gap, Old Navy, Target, etc. are making plans to stop buying from so-called sweatshops.
Of course, when this happens all those employed in these "sweatshops" in Bangladesh, Malaysia, etc. will be unemployed. What, do people think shutting down the garment factories means the workers will get jobs at Intel and Microsoft? Or that  somehow their wages will be increased to economically-unsupported levels for their country/
Duh. I'll chortle as yuppies and GenXers may more for inferior clothing while millions in Bangladesh and Malaysia starve to death over this "save the poor people!" scam.
As for the standard of living issue, I _do_ think the standard of living has declined over the past 40 years, aside from some availability of high tech products and medical care. Most of my employed friends are working half again as many hours as my father worked, are spending twice as much time sitting in traffic, and are living in smaller houses than my parents and my family lived in. And they are paying several times the tax burden. If the wife works, which was rare in the 1950s and into the early 60s, and they have children, then they may be paying a further substantial hit on childcare and I would not want interference to stop free transaction in jobs, but it's disingenuous to ignore the fact that many today are working two jobs, or very, very long hours, to maintain a house that is generally smaller than in years past.
(Yeah, there are are a lot of McMansions. But many engineers in their 30s are still living in crappy apartments. And working 50-hour weeks, at minimum, with hours per day spent sitting in traffic. And on call with cellphones and laptops. And taking work home. And checking their e-mail every night and weekend. And paying 50% or more of what they make in federal income taxes, state income taxes, passed-on property taxes, sales taxes, energy taxes, highway taxes, and Socialist Security taxes. And what they earn in investments, after paying taxes on income, is taxed a second time, even if the alleged investment gains are mostly due to monetary devaluation.)

This is so untrue as to be ridiculously silly. I don't know for certain which decades you are referring to as "when Palo Alto was developed," as it was developed from the decades when Stanford was being established, then when Varian and H-P were being established, then when Lockheed and Fairchild were going strong, then when the chip companies of the 60s and 70s were operating, and so on. However, since Palo Alto was essentially "built out" by the late 1960s, when the last of the Eichlers (*) were finished, I'll address several of these periods:
(Eichlers are a style of house laid on a slab, with relatively little insulation, lots of glass, etc. These typically sold for about $20K during most of the late 50s, early to mid 60s.)
* during the build up of "Professorville" and the other professional-oriented parts of PA, the houses were built by well-paid (for the time) professors. Numerous mansions along University Ave., for example. With lesser houses near Colorado, California, Embarcadero, etc. Even at this time relatively few of the residents were "unable to afford San Francisco."
* during the post-WWII employment by Varian, H-P, Fairchild, and others, a typical engineer made about $12K per year (varied over the years, of course) and the houses cost about $20K. Taxes were a very small fraction, maybe $1.5K per year, total, including federal, state, local, sales, energy, road, etc.
* when I moved to the area in 1974, salaries were about $15K, averaged over educational status, and houses were about $30K. Taxes were dramatically higher, even for lowly-paid starting engineers. The welfare state was in full swing, with more and more people ("of color") simply not working at all, or claiming disability, or hacking the system to extract more handouts for having more children, etc.
Interestingly, at this time, in 1974, San Francisco was a much less expensive place to live in than Palo Alto or Los Altos or even Sunnyvale were. While there were probably some engineers living in Palo Alto whose parents lived in Pacific Heights (a wealthy area of SF) and who thus could not afford to live as there parents had, I saw maybe only one of these folks during my years at Intel. Palo Alto, even though built out, was like a lot of towns that had been built out.
This is simply not so. Most of the steep hillsides in watershed areas are not developed, but this is common in many cities, in many countries.
And the "housing crisis" is roughly comparable in many places I have lived in or spent time or visited. Examples include Portland the areas west of it (plenty of land, but very similar problems), San Antonio, Albuquerque, Northern Virginia, most of southern Florida, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, and nearly all of LA. And from reading news reports and talking to friends, things are much the same in many other parts of the country.
In almost no place even remotely near a large city or suburban area can one buy a house for about 1.5 times a typical local salary for an engineer or comparable college graduate.
A more important problem than "all the land is off limits" is "every worker costs a lot" plus "every permit costs a lot." This is largely due to massive taxation at nearly every level.

Gee, maybe SEAL Team 6 can do an office bid, using anonymous cutouts of course, on when SEALs will go ashore at Bandar Abbas to liquidate the Iranian prime minister? Or maybe a CIA wet work guy can make a few extra bucks in the dead pool by correctly predicting the death of the next Vince Foster?
Besides being problematic in its own right, it also leaks information, a kind of covert covert channel, ironically. If the bids are truly untraceable (fat chance--the password scheme looked like a trival, breakable Gen 1 security system) then those with knowledge of operations can make money by using their knowledge, all untraceably.

Yes, a bunch of "ideas futures" markets have existed for nearly a decade. An acquaintance of mine, Robin Hanson, was actively promoting such things in the late 80s and may have been involved in some of the Extropians-type markets which arose a few years later (I recollect several efforts with varying degrees of success).
And several years ago some companies actually tried to built real markets around these kinds of predictions. Maybe one of them is the "contract company" (pun intended) on this latest DARPA fantasy.
The problem is not with the idea of using markets and bets and Bayesian logic to help do "price discovery" on things like when the Athlon-64 will actually reach consumers, or when the new King of Jordan will be whacked, and so on. The problem is, rather, with _government_ establishing a monopoly on such things while putting suckers like Jim Bell in jail basically for espousing such ideas.
And, as I noted, there are significant problems with government employees in a betting pool (gee, aren't even office baseball pools technically illegal? Haven't they prosecuted some people for this? Yep, they have) where they also have control over the outcome. Jim Bell used this as a payoff mechanism for assassinations ("Alice bets $1000 that Paul Wolfowitz will be murdered with his family on August 10, 2003")...the same logic applies to the government's dead pool.

And use an offshore nexus, and good anonymity and digital cash tools...just as predicted many years ago.
Doing this aboveboard, and doing it with the collusion of the actors who can alter the outcome, is asking for trouble:
* violation of gambling laws...as I said in other articles, betting on the death of the King of Jordan is not different from betting on the winner of the World Series.
* distortion of markets by players who see more benefit in adjusting the expectations than in spending some relatively small amount of money
(If "Chances that weapons of mass destruction being found in Iraq by Nov. 1"  is being de-rated, in a relatively thin market of a few dozen players, then someone with an interest in altering the odds can probably do so with relatively little money...especially if the money is from a Black Budget and comes from money taken at gunpoint from (I can't resist mentioning that I was able to massively distort/sabotage the market in reputations that the Extropian list experimented with in 1993. I did this by buying "play money" (extro-dollars or whatever they were called) from other players in an out-of-band transaction. A mere $20 in U.S. money gave me a huge amount of additional spending money in this reputation market. Naturally, my reputation rose. Likewise, if Paul Wolfowitz wants the market to assess a "grave danger" that Norway is financing terrorism, he can use out-of-band methods to get a bunch of "ringers" (cut-outs, co-conspirators) to start bidding up the market. As the penalty for not guessing correctly is not  clear until the outcome, and inasmuch as the money is provided by agencies, the opportunities for mischief are * Insider trading. Letting government employees benefit from their inside information is like letting IBM or Intel employees engage in a wagering system based on KNOWLEDGE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE. (Not that insider trading is unknown in commodity or stock markets, including futures markets. But these markets have traditionally been heavily regulated and insider trading is forbidden, at least nominally. In the case of this DARPA market, the players are by definition the insiders, with various amounts of very non-public information about plans and contingincies. "Duh.")
And so on. So many attacks on this system.
Anyway, there _already_ are very real, hard to manipulate markets in information. We call them markets. Markets for real estate, for corn, for copper, etc. If a lot of residents of Jordan think a collapse is coming, real estate prices in Amman will fall. If a lot of technologists think a return to copper wiring is coming, copper prices will rise. And so on.
Betting on contrived propositions with relatively small amounts of money ("toy systems") and/or with play money is not very interesting.

WASHINGTON, 30 July The Pentagon has announced plans to offer the FutureMAP technology to courtrooms and their employees.
"Court officers, judges, clerks, persecutors, and even bailiffs will be able to participate in the exciting technology of futures markets," gushed Rear Admiral and Arms Dealer John Poindexter.
"Before a decision is reached, before even the jury has gone to the jury box, people will be able to make side bets on various outcomes, with odds set by the collective action of all. The betting and payoffs are done anonymously, so there are no pesky income tax issues to worry about," added Poindexter.
Poindexter said that the information revealed by the futures market for legal decisions will also help guide judges to make the correct decisions. "I envision this as the ultimate computer technology for the legal profession."
Said one judge in the Ninth Circuit, "As judges we are very poorly paid. How can we live on $160,000 a year? This system will allow us to earn a little bit of money on the side. My clerks are very excited, too. One of my rocket scientists has some ideas about how we can juice up the odds on a long shot decision, with some preliminary rulings, and then swoop in for the kill with the bets we have placed on the actual decision! Cayman Islands, here I come!"
Rear Admiral Poindexter denounced critics of the system as Chicken Littles. "We have checks and balances in place. Don't forget, our office also operates the Total Information Awareness Program, so those microphones and DARPA-developed miniature cameras will really come in handy to check that nobody is abusing the system."

PayPal apparently met the needs of its customers, which was for a low-tech, low-security, no anonymity online payment system. While I'm not saying I predicted it, neither is it surprising that something like it succeeded.
(Members of this very list had some discussions with the guy who started PayPal...I wasn't in on this, but I gather that he used some of the ideas, but not the high security/untraceability ideas...just the online payment low-hanging fruit part. The same is true of EBay, by the way, where some of our crowd developed an online system very much like what E-Bay became, but several years _after_ the AMiX system. C'est la In any case, there will be many successes and failures in Internet-related business. This list is about certain kinds of these systems, but not really about "online payments" in their general form. I'm not saying folks can't or shouldn't talk about Mondex or PayPal or FastTrack, just that they have little to do with the obvious themes of the group.
Software patents and the difficulty of "metering" usage has made this kind of experimentation, this kind of evolutionary learning, much harder to do. For example, when Intel sold the 4004 microprocessor 30 years ago, it owned a bunch of patents and trade secrets about how the chip was made, what it's design was, etc.
But it didn't force potential customers to lay out their business plans, to sign "no compete" clauses, and it did not have to devise complex ways of knowing how many chips a customer was using. The chips metered themselves, metered the patents and other IP, and Intel could sell them to guys in garage shops, companies in Boise and Peoria, and even to distributors to resell and resell.
Such is not the case with, say, the Digicash software. Since Chaum, then the Canadians, then the Indians, then First Data, etc., wanted to maximize the payoff and "get a piece of the action," they could not simply sell the technology, even bits of it, to guys in garages and people with bizarre and untested ideas.
And such software is usually not sold to unidentifiable customers. Digicash (or its descendants) will not sell one copy of its core technology to a company without draconian safeguards and audits. This is part of why a paper trail back to the users of various technologies exist when above-board licensing is used. (And why many of us would obviously then favor simply _taking_ the technology, ripping it off. This cuts the paper and liability trail. Yes, there are minor issues with "theft of intellectual property," but this is mostly smoke and mirrors anyway. No one in the Western world seems to think ideas in general are patentable, so how did RSA get patented? We've had this discussion many times over the past 11 years. And more.)
This is replicated all over the digital landscape, where software packages have complicated licensing schemes and where vendors want to see only "staid and conservative" business plans. No Digicash for BlackNet, in other words.
This whole phenomenon has dramatically slowed down exploratory developement and weird, new ideas. A couple of guys in a tilt-up in Silicon Valley simply cannot just go down to Fry's to buy some parts and try out some ideas, not in this world of licenses, audits, lawyers, and generally pointless efforts to meter usage.
Which is why doing things without benefit of any patent licenses is the best strategy. That this also requires no nexus, no trail back to a corporate office, is of course part of why it's the best strategy.

Ken Adelman, the retired gazillionaire who has gained new fame as a  photographer of the California coastline, lives a couple of parcels  from me, perhaps half a kilometer.
For a while now, I'd  wondered who owned the heliport that had  helicopters departing and arriving a few times a week (that I knew  of...could have been more). I couldn't actually see the heliport, due  to some ridges and some trees, but I could see the choppers banking  over my hilltop and disappearing behind a ridge.
Well, today I did some Googling on Ken Adelman, who I already knew was  a Corralitos resident. I had no idea where in my little community he  lived, only that he had California's largest private solar cell array  (and had gotten into yet another controversy, with PG&E, our power  monopoly, when he proposed to connect his array to the grid and be paid  for the power he _added_ to the grid, as per official law and PG&E  policy...it seems PG&E really doesn't _want_ the sheeple generating  power, though they tolerate tiny, hobbyist generators...but Adelman['s  array was an actual competitor, and would cost them money, so they  tried to nix it...another story).
In reading about the controversy over Streisand's property, I saw that  Adelman is using his own helicopter. A bell went off in my head and I  Googled to find his home address.
His address in the phone book is unlisted, but he gave his home address  in one or more of his ventures, and so up it popped in a Google search  on his name: 1365 Meadowridge Rd., the road just before mine (Allan  Lane) off of Brown's Valley Road. My address is 427 Allan Lane.  Entering these into Yahoo or Mapquest shows how close our properties  Here's one such street map:
His property is about where the first "d" in Meadowridge Rd. appears.  My property is at the end of Allan Lane.
Obviously, then, it is his helicopter I've been seeing flying over to  about that spot. (Tiny chance it's someone else's...)
BTW, I don't think this Ken Adelman, who is now 39-40, is the same Ken  Adelman who advised Reagan in the 1980s on arms control--the D.C.-based  Adelman was graying and balding at least 15 years ago, so I doubt  they're the same person.

Also, the Clipper chip politics and the belief that PRZ was about to be arrested gave PGP a certain kind of notoriety...it became "cool" ("bad," "def") to use PGP.

AWACS-type planes have long had the ability to act as "cell towers," so cell traffic is easily picked-up, if in fact they are doing this. Landline signals are vastly harder to pick up, and I doubt strongly that every minorly-radiating landline signal is being picked up.
Perhaps for very, very targetted signals, but not cruising over general cities, it seems likely to me.
I'm not sure of the context here, but in the past year there were some reports of planes circling over university campuses, and many were hypothesizing that SIGINT was being done on telephone and computer messages. This seemed unlikely to me.
I concluded--and posted on Usenet about my thinking--that some campuses may have been targeted for low-level gamma ray surveys. Kind of a gamma ray version of Shipley's "war driving" maps. Possibly for construction of baseline maps of existing radioisotopes in university labs, hospitals, and private facilities. Then deviations from baseline maps could be identified and inspected in more detail with ground-based vans and black bag ops.

@_subject: SIGINT planes vs. radioisotope mapping 
I certainly never implied in any way that a simple G-M tube would be useful for this. Implicit in my radioistope mapping comment was that a gamma ray spectrometer would be used.
As for portability, the one I used in my lab in 1979-82 was not terribly heavy. The heaviest part was the LN dewar, which was large and floor-standing. A large dewar is certainly not needed.
The rest of the assembly, even 20 years ago, was mostly portable: the germanium detector head, some preamps and pulse-height analyzers, and a multichannel analyzer. Most of this stuff is now done on laptops, the MCA and analysis software part. Without researching this on the Net, I would thus conjecture the entire gamma ray spectrometer could fit in a small carry-on case, using a small dewar.
Certainly for the cost of operating a light plane, such a spectrometer would be a minor cost by comparison.
And note that this is just what can be easily bought on the open market...N.E.S.T. (Nuclear Emergency Search Team) and similar LEO people almost certainly have more miniaturized detector setups.
I expect most of the N.E.S.T. detectors are also gamma ray spectrometers, probably now so portable they fit unobtrusively into briefcases for use in crowded areas. As we discussed a few months ago (and I think I discussed this in _particular_ with Thomas!), the S/N advantages of using a spectrometer are enormous. Thousand-to-one improvements in general S/N are easily achievable. Even more if the MCA software is looking for pairs or triples or n-tuples of gamma peaks and inferring likely radioisotopes.
(I used this approach in 1981 to solve a major problem in IBM computers which were using Intel chips...and I don't mean the alpha particle soft error problem. This was a different problem, involving a beta source trapped in some of the packages. For this I used a pair of large sodium iodide crystals (which my well-equipped lab just happened to have in a storage cabinet, fortunately for us) and looked for a specific decay mode that resulted in a pair of gammas sent out in opposite directions. By using coincidence logic over microsecond intervals, enormous improvements in S/N could be achieved. Basically, background radiation vanished and only the specific beta decay mode we were looking for --Tim May

I believe it was the McClure-Volkmer Amendment (or somesuch spelling) of some years back that clarified the laws regarding interstate transport of firearms. Instead of having to know the details of every single state one might be driving through on a trip, one was exempted from the local firearms laws while the guns were locked up in a trunk or suitable lockable container. This was hailed at the time as a major step towards stopping one state from busting those from North Carolina, say, when they passed through Maryland on their way to a hunting trip in Maine.
The reasonable interpretation of McClure-Volkmer would have protected someone while in  their vehicle, and probably while at a motel in some state, but would not have protected those staying for more than what a simple trip would take.
I'm not surprised to hear that some jurisdictions think they can exempt themselves, especially for such trivial paper violations as having a shotgun shell.
Mexico is like this, too. Gringos have spent time in Mexican jails because they neglected to thoroughly inspect every square inch of their vehicles, and the shakedownistas found a .22 cartridge under the floor mats. (The intent was probably to collect $100 mordita.) All this while drug operations run more or less without interruption and as they are equipped with fully-automatic HKs and FALs, the Army-issue rifles. So they bust a tourist for having a .22 cartridge while MP-5s and Uzis abound. Typical government.)
As for Bill's point about a gas can strapped to the roof, this is a common way of carrying extra fuel, and is generally legal if the can is DOT approved (the red ones). LandCruisers and suchlike are often seen this way. As noted, safer than carrying them inside.
Of course, normal rights and liberties are dispensed with when mere suspicion of planning to use the gas is involved.

The U.S. believes in basic rights for _some_ Americans, but certainly for none of the sand niggers it conquers.
It declares the soldiers it fights to be "illegal combatants" and subjects them to torture at Guantanamo Bay. I hope some captured U.S. soldiers are declared to be "illegal combatants" and similarly tortured and murdered.
As for Bush, Cheney, Rice, Powell, Wolfowitz, Perle and the rest of the Jew, er, New World Order, I hope they are eventually tried for treason for their lies and, if found guilty of lying about the supposed "WMDs," then hanged in a public square.  Actually, I hope General Powell first does the honorable thing and uses his .45 for its Approved Alternative Shame-Reduction Purpose.

It never makes sense to argue about a "right to lie" or a "right to tell the truth." One man's lie is another man's truth. And even _asking_ for a true response is usually an overstepping, as it presumes the asker knows what is true and what is not. Pilate said it all 2000 years ago.

This is why I like the "Congresss shall make no law" and "shall not be infringed" absoluteness of the original Constitution. The language does not natter about "truthful speaking shall not be infringed."
And this is why more recent legislation allowing government to regulate "commercial speech" or to decide which speech is true and which is false (as in advertising claims) is so corrosive to liberty.

They fired off threatening letters and demanded action.
Had Orrin Hatche's seek and destroy software been available, his site would have been toast.

The point being that sensor data from outside the box does NOT get written to either flash or disk drive storage directly. It is collected from many places and fed through the assortment of microprocessors.
High voltages are clamped in the usual ways, with Schottky diodes protecting the inputs, etc. Even if signals massively outside the specs got into the boxes, it would be the processors which got fried, not the storage devices. This was my point about how "sparky things" would not overwrite data.
It takes logic to correctly write to storage.
The processors and peripheral logic _might_ be zapped, but the storage chips would almost certainly not have been erroneously overwritten...just a matter of disconnecting them and reading them in another system, something most forensic or recovery labs probably have many jigs set up for.

Islam is interesting because of the self-consistency of a single vision written by Mohammed. I am astonished that one person could write that whole thing (not that I have read much of the Koran, but what I have looked at is self-consistent). I figure Mohammed had latent talents as a poet or writer and these came out during his desert cave stays, perhaps, one might speculate, assisted by various herbs and mushrooms.
I once asked a Muslim rug merchant I knew about this. He was adamant that Mohammed did not write the Koran...he kept saying "Ha-breel!" Which, it took me a few seconds to figure out, is Arabic for the angel Gabriel, which I vaguely recollected was supposed to have come down into Mohammed's cave and dictated the word of Allah to Mohammed.

The government always exempts itself from laws, or ignores the laws, or is not pursued by "law enforcement."
At the trivial side of the scale, this is what allows cops to speed on the roads for no actual need. They are used to going fast when they want to, so they do. Other cops either ignore them (for various reasons) or give them "professional courtesy" as soon as they identify themselves as fellow cops.
On the more serious side of the scale, governments run drug operations, ship contraband, smuggle arms, torture suspects, conspire with criminal regimes around the world, and set up criminal enterprises to benefit themselves and their friends.
And on the most serious side, governments force taxpayers into Ponzi schemes for their retirements while carefully exempting themselves and their own retirement funds.

I fully agree.
Though I was, and am, against the war on grounds often discussed here, the French have once again behaved in a tacky way. Besides their ulterior motives (loans to Saddam, oil deals, want a piece of the pie), they are now behaving about as they behaved in 1940.
"How many men does it take to defend Paris?" "Nobody knows...it's never been tried."
"Why are there trees planted along the Champs-Elysee?" "So the Germans can march in the shade."
"One million like-new rifles for sale...only been dropped once."
The right-wing columnist Jonathan Goldberg dubbed them "cheese-eating surrender monkeys" several years ago, long before this latest matter. Has a great cadence, and it's accurate.
Ever wonder why there are virtually no French folks on this list? A few Belgians, and the one guy who broke one of the crypto challenges in the mid-90s, though he was never much of a commentator on the list per se. But essentially zero French input. I was once invited to give a talk to "Imagina," a French-affiliated conference and trade show held in a ritzy (literally) hotel in Monte Carlo. I was on a panel with David Chaum and also gave a separate talk. I had a few days to talk to my French hosts and panel arrangers, and also to some French journalists. They were fascinated with the postmodern, deconstructionist, philosophical implications of crypto anarchy...and they loved throwing around references to Saussure, Foucault, and various other French lit-crit figures, but the thought of actually programming computers or building technology was, apparently, horrifying to them. No wonder there are no longer any well-known French computer companies...Matra has faded, Thompsen CSF is doing most of its real work in its affiliates and owned companies elsewhere.
Finally, a personal story. I lived for more than a year on the French Riviera, in the town of Villefranche sur Mer, between Nice and Monte Carlo. A great experience. The beautiful Cap Ferrat, home to Somerset Maugham, David Niven, and, later, the Rolling Stones, was visible from my bedroom window. But the French people were describable with only one word: ingrates. More than a few times we had French people lecture us on what racists the Americans were...this even as their Algerian problem was all around us. And one old French lady said "We should take all of the Americans out in a boat and sink it."
This was in 1964, just one generation after the loss of hundreds of thousands of American lives to liberate France and the rest of continental Europe. This was after the French had put up only token military resistance when the Germans rolled across their borders in American soldiers fought and died where the French would not. (Yeah, I know, they were all in "Le Resistance." Fatuous nonsense.)
This is probably why so many French hated the Americans so much, in a way the Germans and Austrians and Italians did not. The Americans defeated the Axis fair and square and the Germans knew this. They were occupied by the conquering force for several years and moved on with their lives, restarting their once-impressive economy and returning to the forefront of nations. Except for the Nazi atrocities, with a fair amount of honor left. The French, on the other hand, showed no honor. And so they resented and despised the Americans for doing what they themselves were unwilling to do.
Fuck them.
Again, I was and still am against "foreign entanglements" and "pre-emptive wars," but if there's one good thing that comes out of this war it's that the French are getting their comeuppance. Not only are their loans to Iraq never likely to be repaid, but they are clearly utterly out in the cold on the "rebuilding of Iraq" and on future oil The cheese-eating surrender monkeys are now wining [SIC] that they should be "included" in the aftermath of the war, that they should at least be allow to send in literary theorists to explain the existential significance of the war for the Iraqi people.

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
So, yes, if Congress tried to pass a law about the speech of trees or rocks, it would be unconstitutional under the "shall make no law" language. This doesn't mean trees and rocks have "freedom of the press" or "free speech rights."
More practically, the First means Congress shall make no law about speech, period. Or about the other things covered. Notice the word "or." This is important.
The First does not say "Congess shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech of individual persons when engaged in press activities or political speech."
It says what it says.
The "rights of corporations," to use your phrasing, thus derive from the specific prohibition placed on Congress (and thus on all states, through their requirement to support and defend the Constitution as a condition of joining the Union...and repeated in the 14 Amendment because some states didn't think the words of the Constitution applied to their fiefdoms).

In a free society, nothing stops an employee from seeking a lower stress, less demanding, lower profit margin employer, lower-paying job. In America, these low-paid employees are called "public teachers."
And our teachers in public schools are similarly free to not operate at their full potential, or even close to it, and yet be paid a moderate salary. They can even steal stuff the way your father did.
(But they'd better not do it in corporations such as the one I worked for: we fired their asses. No severance pay, and a blacklist from working in other companies. We told prospective employers of their Probably because they were either pirated or were rehashes/copies of Western books.
Not in all cases. I have a few Soviet physics and math texts written by some of the greats of Soviet physics and math. Printed on cheap paper, with the authors barely compensated, they were certainly cheap. And, of course, often prone to having ideology inserted by the commisars.
My first roommate in college was from Hong Kong. He had the Feynman Lectures printed on rice paper editions with the print bleeding through. Very inexpensive. Feynman, of course, saw no royalties. Which is OK, but understand that your country was operating as a Napster Do you think American schools do not have such clubs? I was in a dozen of them, and President of several.

Arguing "intent" in business matters comes very close to being pure I was a participant in Intel Corporation's famous "CRUSH" program, a program to try to drive competitors, including AMD, out of business.
If you think businesses are not trying to drive other businesses into bankruptcy, you need to wake up and look around. Nothing illegal about this, nothing unconstitutional.
As with so-called "hate crimes" like burning effigies or crosses,  existing laws about vandalism, trespassing, theft, etc., are more than enough. No additional laws about trying to drive a competitor out of business or burning a cross to protest the Holocaust Myth are needed.

Don't believe what you see on television or movies is any measure of the norm. Similar to the "inspection paradox," what one is observing is usually not the norm.
While a few teachers all around the world (U.S., Australia, Scotland, Germany, etc.) have gotten shot, this can happen in lots of professions. It's what happens when there are a few billion people with television cameras and reporters in close proximity.
What are you talking about? All of the clubs I knew of were free. A few were closed except to those invited (based on various criteria), but most were open to anyone with interest. Same as Cypherpunks.
Yes, you are right, the great electronics companies of the 1960s sit astride our economic life, crushing the life out of real competition! With Fairchild and Rheem Semiconductor and Mohawk Data Sciences controlling everything, new ideas and innovations cannot be developed!
And the 1970s were much, much worse, with the computer companies consolidating their power and dominating all computer work! Who can innovate when Burroughs, Honeywell, Data General, Univac, NCR, DEC, and CDC utterly dominate?
Nonsense. Anyone who has recruited, hired, fired, and otherwise managed employees know the true story. Namely, that good people are hard to find, hard to hire, hard to keep, and that they must be coddled and accommodated in their idiosyncracies.
Do you think Declan's employees view him as just an interchangeable Better yet, do you think I have changed all that much since when I was a physicist working for Intel? I was considered a trouble maker, a shit disturber....but a damned good thinker and problem solver. I often solved problems almost "on the spot," in meetings where I was brought in, when roomfuls of idiots had been assigning each other "action items" for months. (A lot of time people seem to think they cannot solve a problem by thinking about it, so they try to look busy, shuffle papers, and hope someone else solves the problem. I merely listened, poked around, and developed mental images of what was happening. Usually this worked very quickly.)
For this, they cut me a lot of slack. They gave me a big lab and told me to keep on doing what I was doing.
This is about as far from "degraded to mere replaceable "human resources"" as one can get. And there were a lot of people treated like And when I had to hire people, finding them and keeping them was no easy chore.
(Getting rid of some of them was also difficult...especially the coloreds. Our Personnel people practically flipped out when a colored person had to be fired. We had to do extra steps, and still we got sued for "racial discrimination." I don't think any of the coloreds ever won their cases, though.)
You seem to have some very skewed ideas of what "capitalism" means. You seem to think it means mean old capitalist bosses whip the proles and fire them at will. Your teachers are still teaching you the Marxist dialectic, I think.
Nonsense. Basic research is being done by many people. Corporations have never been the best place for blue-sky, academic research. This is one reason the U.S. and Western Europe have thousands of excellent universities and colleges offering Ph.D. programs and all the things that go with them (professors doing research, grant money, tie-ins with corporations, etc.).
"Research" is a very broad topic, covering many fields and many issues. Issues of basic physics vs. applied technology, issues of biological principles vs. new drugs and new tools, issues of fundamental mathematics vs. computer programming.
I think research is doing very well. Some fields are "mined out" in terms of major new paradigms, at least in terms of the energies and scales we can now probe. Some are undergoing rapid change. Some are hotbeds of academic research, some are most closely related to corporation projects. All to be expected.

(quoting Thomas Shaddack)
I want to add something to this, as the topic (and Thomas' views) are both angering me and stimulating me to write about this.
Item: Research in astrophysics and cosmology is booming today. No corporate interest in figuring out the role of dark matter, dark energy, superstrings, anthropic reasons for the neutrino mass, inflation, and a dozen other currently hot topics. Much of the work came from the fruits of industrial development, just as much of the astronomy work of the past 150 years, even longer, has come from industrial methods and tools. In the 1930s, the ability to construct very large Pyrex mirrors...I lived in the 1950s within a pleasant Sunday drive to Mount Palomar, for a long time the very largest telescope in the world.
The same ferment is also happening in several other fields. Physics went through this ferment in the 1920s-60s, though things have tapered off in the past couple of decades (with some conspicuous exceptions).
Item: In today's news is a report that two groups have sequenced the SARS virus. Which brings up "sequencing." A single guy, a surfer and LSD user at UC San Diego, invented polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a way of "amplifying" tiny samples into things which machines could sequence. Hence was gene sequencing invented. Not a corporate lab, but a guy thinking about things as he paddled his surfboard. Similar examples abound.
Item: In crypto, Diffie and Hellman were at Stanford, Merkle was at Berkeley, and Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman were at MIT. Again, no corporate labs. Nobody either "stifling innovation" or "failing to support basic research." Also in crypto, David Chaum was at UC Santa Barbara working on his ideas, then at Berkeley (affiliated or living there, doesn't much matter).
I reject the claim that corporations and capitalism are either stifling innovation or that innovation is not happening because corporations aren't doing "enough" basic research.
(There are some practical reasons why corporations are usually not great places for very basic research. I could write a few pages on this, but will not do so here.)
I think innovation is doing perfectly well, and I further think the innovations which have come out of the corporate/capitalist/open society/Western system have been a whole lot greater in all respects than what have come out of socialist/closed society/Iron Curtain Which makes claims that capitalism is not doing enough research even more wrong-headed.
Thanks to Thomas for triggering this rant, though.

I don't recall many discussions here about _timetables_ for such developments. Certainly I don't think _I_ have been so foolish as to say "Real Soon Now" or "Surely by the Year 2010!"
Recall that Vinge's "True Names" was set at some indeterminate time in the future. Judging by the power of the computers, and modulo the fact that he wrote it in the 1970s, probably no earlier than 2030. But he was also careful not to specify the time.
Likewise, "Ender's Game" took place far into the future.
Which is not to say that science fiction novels determine the schedule! But it lends support to my claim that few, if any, of us would be so foolish as to predict when the full implications of strong crypto would have a major effect on governments.
Arguably, some effects have been felt for years. And just as arguably, some other effects (notably digital money) seem to be further off now than they seemed to be when Digicash was still in existence.
The nice thing for libertarians and anarchocapitalists about working on these sorts of ideas is that it beats the alternative: going to Libertarian Party conventions and trying to convince neighbors to vote for more liberty.  Or, as too many good technical people have done, becoming lawyers. (Some of the skills are the same: the ability to absorb a lot of seemingly-unrelated facts, the ability to argue logically, and sometimes even an ideological edge. But since most lawyers don't end up working on cutting-edge constitutional issues, and since the constitutional issues are generally not moving in a libertarian direction despite the efforts of cypherpunks-friendly lawyers and scholars, I personally see going into "the law" as throwing one's life away.)
I believe the great social and economic changes in history, affecting people and government and nations, have been largely technological. Geography is important, of course, too. But technology is something we can change, so this is what humans should focus on.
These technological changes are obvious: metal-working, writing, weaponry, plumbing, the printing press, the steam engine, interchangeable parts, electrification, and all of the various technologies of the 20th century, including the telephone, television, birth control pills, and so on.
The printing press is one of my favorite examples, as it illustrates how the "triad" of technology, law, and culture (similar to Larry Lessig's triad...I think we developed these ideas independently, but I haven't chased down who wrote what first) is "tipped" by major changes. The Church and State, circa pre-Gutenberg, "owned" certain types of knowledge, blessed by the medieval guilds: silversmithing, leathermaking, etc. The royal patents were conferred based on kickbacks, tithing, family connections, etc. Those who violated the patents of the guilds faced various kinds of punishment, I suppose up to and including death. Sort of like the Mafia stopping independent producers of porn from producing movies (a friend in LA had this happen to him).
Now the "lawyers" of that age might have argued in courts (such as they were) that the power of the guilds should be broken, that greater economic prosperity would result from breaking the guilds.
But little changed.
Then came printing (movable type). While the first books printed were the obvious ones: hymnals, bibles, and other religious tracts, the printers began to print "how to" books. Not consciously "Toolmaking for Dummies" books, and not consciously "How to Undermine the Power of the State by Building Your Own Waterwheel," these books were nonetheless early how-to guides. Booklets on technology, on minerals, on all sorts of things a farmer might want to know. For the first time, knowing how to read was a useful skill.
Perhaps someone predicted the long-term implications of what this spread of knowledge would mean. (Maybe Nostradamus was influenced this way...I haven't looked for evidence.)
Someone trying to set a timetable for the sweeping changes would likely have not gotten it right.
As someone wise once said, we tend to overestimate the short-term consequences and underestimate the long-term consequences.
In the case of printing, the result over the following century or two was a rise in literacy rates (in the common languages, and this is when German, French, and English, for example, largely solidified into their current forms, viz. the Luther Bible, the King James Version, etc.). And the Protestant Reformation was built on printed words and on the people's ability to directly read the religious texts.
A technology undermined the state and the church.
This was repeated several more times, with samizdats undermining the power of the state in the USSR, with cassette tapes circulating in Shah-led Iran, with videotapes widely available even where banned in Islamic nations.
And e-mail, of course. E-mails to and from the dissidents in Beijing. Repeated around the world.
Strong crypto, of course, offers the opportunity for a complete bypassing of controls (more than just ciphers are needed, of course, as stego must be strong, as remailers must be compensated, and so on).
Will the effects be that corner grocery stores are converted into cryptoanarchist data havens? Of course not.
People will continue to buy and sell goods in their physical world, and this will continue to be a nexus of control and taxation. (Just as taxing land became more important after taxing knowledge, via the no longer all-powerful guilds, became less important. Land remained a nexus of control and taxation, as it does today. My property taxes attest to that, and will not be going down in my lifetime!)
So, what changes may happen? Will enough tax evasion happen via cryptoanarchy to make the people fed up and thus give rise to a "tipping point"? (As the Reformation arguably was, with enough people fed up with the selling of indulgences and having the ability to read the religious words themselves.)
And so on. I could ask about a dozen speculations of what might happen.
But the point is not to predict some withering away of the state. The point is that unfettered communication, with the already-extant ability to use all sorts of alternative financial instruments (offshore accounts, PayPal, E-gold, etc.), is already producing interesting changes in the way the world works.
More such changes are likely. When, I don't know.
It could be that 5 years from now we'll be looking back a year or two to the rise of a digital cash company which is having the same success E-Bay had and saying "We knew it was coming."
(In fact, friends of mine, the late Phil Salin and his colleagues at AMiX, had essentially identical plans for an auction service. And this was as early as 1987, as I did some consulting for Phil in late '87 and into '88. Their company was funded by Autodesk and they rolled out a version of their auction service in 1990-91. This was before Net connections were widely available--and commercial use of the Internet was still problematic--and their system had some problems, like glacial slowness. Also, instead of concentrating on a pure classified ads model, with people selling their used ski equipment and Pez dispensers, they concentrated on people selling their knowledge, their consulting expertise. This was a mistake. But had Autodesk not decided to disband both Xanadu (hypertext) and AMiX, they had a reasonable shot at being the company E-Bay became several years later.)
But, getting back to this 5-year "prediction," I don't expect any widespread digital money system in the next few years. Too many regulatory hurdles (and regulators can slow things down, even if the long-term trends are not in their favor). The current police state, the U.S. sitting astride the world, giving orders. The money laundering, terrorism, treason focus of prosecutors.
As you say:
The important thing is to not become so attached to a specific prediction, or, worse, to a timetable, that one becomes discouraged.
Oh, and to repeat something I have said many times, I think starting a company based on some imagined schedule for adoption of digital money is a disaster. I could be wrong on this, and I even hope someone proves me wrong, but I don't think I am.
("And in Year 3 of our business plan, the world converts to Digital Anonibucks (TM) and we all become wealthy.")
Better to view digital money technologies as bits and pieces of technology which will be gradually adopted and used by others. The money will probably be made by folks who are qualified to work as engineers and programmers in other companies.
Which is not to say people should not be thinking about forming small companies to do interesting things. Whether in digital money or data havens or timestamping, niches will exist. (But most of the people in  the world don't see any particular need for these technologies--the technologies don't _yet_ do anything for them, and people don't usually make huge efforts purely for ideological reasons...especially when the ideology is not even theirs.)
I expect early adopters to be in the "illegal" markets: pornography of various kinds (the most illegal kinds), on-line betting, information selling (a la BlackNet), and tax evasion. For mundane uses, people are happy giving credit card numbers and using relatively weak protocols like PayPal (for convenience, not security).
But I've written about this in other articles, so no need to get into it here.
The bottom line is this: we tend to overestimate short-term consequences and underestimate long-term consequences. So don't give up.

I'll take this challenge, silly as it is.
By "any crypto designed by mankind" I assume you are excluding one-time pads, which are not breakable by any amount of computer power and any amount of mathematical knowledge. I assume you are referring to public key approaches, where _conceivably_  mathematical advances or almost inconceivable advances in computer power could result in PK ciphers being broken.
Assuming your conditions are exactly as you state, I would of course pick box number ONE.
We still outnumber those in government, and what they have to hide is mostly of little interest to me or my causes (troop movements, submarine positions, etc.). Also, they can easily fall back to courier-delivered one-time pads, which are not part of the assumption, as I see it. (If you are including even one-time pads being broken, then you are assuming magic, which is not interesting.)
Thus, having a way to securely and untraceably communicate and transact business is much more important than being able to read THEIR bullshit That was easy.
And the cool thing is that every indication is that cipher-making is still pulling away from cipher-breaking by leaps and bounds, so it looks to me that we are falling further into the right choice.

I was in college during some of those years, 1970-74, and can assure you that most of the kids around me were very, very far from being libertarian. Yeah, they like free sex and cheap pot, and so on, but they favored "government that works!," and they flocked to lefties like Bobby Kennedy, Gene McCarthy, and even Hubert Humphrey. They saw high tax rates as punishment for capitalists.
Angela Davis was their hero, Cuba their idea of a just society.

A symptom of our weird, statist, collectivist times is that many who excel at math, science, and business are now being increasingly characterized as "having Asperger's Syndrome." (Cf.  for hundreds of references.)
In one line, Asperger's Syndrome is said to be a variant of autism, a kind of "able to function in society" variant on autism.
Bill Gates is described as having Asperger's. In the past few weeks, we hear that Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein were "probable Asperger's."
Maybe a biochemical or DNA link to a real syndrome, besides brightness, will be found, but I suspect that a lot of people with the ability to concentrate are characterized as being some kind of second-rate Rainmans just because they don't watch "Oprah" and "Survivor" on t.v.
I've never met Bill Gates, though I did meet some of his contemporaries (Gary Kildall, Steve Wozniak, and of course all the folks at Intel). He seems a little weird at times...but no more so than a lot of the folks I meet at Cypherpunks, Hackers, PenSFA, etc.
My tentative conclusion is that calling someone successful a "case of Asperger's" is just another form of envy or trash-talking. (Or of the popular meme in the past 30 years where child actors are fed lines showing their putative precociousness as they psychoanalyze the adults around them.)

Same here. We pretty much stayed in our seats. None of the spontaneous wandering around the room I have seen in video footage of today's kids. Sure, some kids were more active than others, but nothing like what I hear about and see today.
But they were polluting our essence back in the 1950s, when water fluoridation and fluoride toothpaste became common.
Aluminum frying pans? Teflon?
Or, more likely: endless gallons of sugar water. When I was a kid, a 6-ounce bottle of Coca Cola was a special treat. (Though I recall we drank a fair amount of Kool-Aid. And Fizzies, before they were banned.) Today's kids tank up on Big Gulps and Supersize It! 32-ounce portions. Even soda vending machines in the schools, and soft drinks served with Likewise, a lot more fast food today. Where once it was a treat to go to a burger place, now they dot the landscape and many kids eat at them nearly every day.
And lack of discipline is probably a big factor. If teachers simply told the kids to sit down and stop fidgeting, as they did with us, maybe there would be fewer of these alleged ADHD cases.
But the single most likely reason for the rise in alleged ADHD cases is the pharmaceutical industry. And job security for the "psychiatric staff" at K12 schools. Where once there was a nurse bandaging cuts and scrapes, now there's a staff of psychobabblers and sexuality counselors.

Except there's no strong evidence that people without glasses saw better a thousand years ago. Maybe 10 thousand years ago.
A lot of the "eagle eyes" were just people with naturally 20-20 vision. In most European and Asian societies going way, way back, most people didn't need good long and near vision past a certain age. They held things close, they squinted, and likely they did OK even in hunting parties where the animals were herded over cliffs or into box canyons.
Eyeglasses have become common only in the past 100 years (and arguably in the past 60 years, about since the time visits to eye doctors became common). While there have been jokes about "four eyes" not breeding, because they can't get dates, neither this theory nor the converse appear to have any correlation with actual breeding patterns. Do more kids today need glasses than 100 years ago? Than 500 years ago? Than 5000 years ago? An interesting question, but claims that the past 60-100 years of eyeglass wearing have caused some major change in genetics seems to be a stretch.
I agree that things are very different now.
I look at the economic side, mostly. Once the slow, or the drunkardly, or the inept, served on farms and estates and kept the horses, did gardening, and so on. Today, we pay them to sit at home and eat Doritos while watching Oprah. And yard workers are hard to find, and expensive.
(I just got in from a muddy and dirty day spent moving dirt and sand, spent planting a Minneola Tangelo, and a couple of shrubs. Nearly five hours out digging, shoveling, mixing soil with amendments and manure, digging holes, planting, soaking the root balls, then cleaning up. Which is why I'm now posting, five hours after going out, exhausted, but happy to be back online. And I did much the same a few days ago, and a few days before that, and so on. Those who have been to my house know I have 1.5 acres on a hilltop, and it needs a lot of work to keep the weeds and chapparal from encroaching. My point? The cheap labor--the retards, the shiftless, the drunks--is now being paid out of my taxes (approaching 60% of what I earn) to collect AFDC, welfare, and the catch-all "disability." We need to abolish all of these payments and make the 'tards, the drunks, the unskilled all realize they either hoe the land for a relative pittance or they starve.)
(I would hire some of the illegal alien Mexicans who hang out at our local K-Mart except some of them have reportedly tumbled to the fact that they can do a day's work and then threaten to report their illegal work (no SSNs, no Disability Insurance, blah blah) to the INS, who is more interested in catching a gringo hiring wetbacks than in deporting the wetbacks. Also, there are injury scams to collect payouts from gringo suckas.)

And equally anecdotally, my prescription has changed very little since when I was 14, when I first got glasses. I am now 51 and I can easily wear my glasses from 20 years ago as a backup pair. (Somewhere I have my old John Lennon-style glasses from _32_ years ago, and they are close to my current prescription.) Wearing glasses has not worsened my vision, and I doubt strongly that _not_ wearing glasses would improve my vision...though it might make me squint and strain and pull my eyes the way the girls in high school used to do to see the blackboard.
I don't see any evidence that wearing glasses weakens eyes...the issue of vision correction is primarily one of eyeball shape, not the muscles which can, through squinting and straining, improve vision.
Most people become nearsighted if they are young and lose their 20-20 vision. Some become farsighted. I see no evidence that those who become nearsighted when they are young would keep their good vision if only they skipped getting glasses. (I did notice a very large fraction of the girls in my high school squinting and using their fingers to pull their eyes, this to avoid wearing glasses. Perhaps this is why so many of them did so poorly in class? The several girls who did well in our school all wore glasses. The cheerleaders didn't, except for one, but they all got pregnant shortly after graduation and worked for Piggly-Wiggly and various banks, as tellers.)
If you have some real evidence that wearing glasses is the cause of poor vision, I'm all ears, so to speak.

This is a minor, but illustrative, example of why the problem is best fixed by property rights, not collectivism.
(Funny, the word "collectivism" rarely pops up here. We ought to use it more, as it better describes a bunch of things we often call socialism.)
On your own property, in your own garden, one doesn't have to argue with committees and government officials and city councils about spraying or when one can start working the soil.
This is the commons problem cropping up again in this common garden.
Me, I have my own garden plot on my own land. And even if I didn't own land, working out a deal with someone who _did_ have land would be preferable to working in a so-called "community garden."
(We have a few here in Santa Cruz. Bums and winos make a token effort to stand around and rake. Mostly it's an excuse for community money to be handed out to the "farmers." I've also walked past the weed-choked community garden in Berkeley, on the site of "People's Park," IIRC. Skanks and bums. New slogan for these urban community gardens: "Hoes fo da hoes!

There is indeed a private toll road, Highway 73 going from a point near San Juan Capistrano to a point near Irvine. It passes mostly through part of the former Irvine Ranch, mostly uninhabited. Basically, contiguous with part of the Laguna Hills. (Consult a map if interested. Yahoo will show it by entering "Irvine, CA".)
I've taken it a few times, at the suggestion of my younger brother, ever-impatient with any delays. We did not take it during rush hour periods. Frankly, it cut a few miles off the normal I-5 route, and was slightly faster.
This private toll road would be very hard to build in any other place, as the ownership of the large tract of undeveloped land made it possible. Private developers rarely are granted eminent domain (seizure of lands or property for the people's democratic socialist use) and it is virtually impossible to conceive of a developer acquiring rights of way for a highway through thousands of farms, houses, ranches, schools, shops, etc.
(I know about auctions, but there are some markets that don't "clear." There are people who simply refuse to sell. Even when The Donald (Trump) sought to build a casino in Atlantic City there was one parcel owner who refused to sell. Once the state of NJ refused to condemn the property to give it to the Donald, he built _around_ it on three sides.)
Even when the population was a fraction of what it is today, this was a problem building railroads. Of course, though the books on free enterprise are light on mentioning this, the private railroads got the land rights by coercion, threats, burning out settlers, bribing state officials, etc. "Blazing Saddles" was not far off the mark.
Today, a private toll road could basically not been be built in areas where they are most needed. Q.E.D.
As I discussed in my reply yesterday, people don't rally enthusiasm for things which are just not going to  happen anyway, anywhich, anyhoo.
And any emergent enthusiasm would be met with a vast counter-reaction from the neighbors, the affected land owners, etc.

If I'm not mistaken--and I haven't done any Googling on this--the new toll road is next to the older and still operating road.
(I have not been on the Dulles Access Road since 1991, but I recall the private toll road was under construction next to it, on the same right of way.)
I spent most of the 60s in the Langley/Fairfax area, and I took travelled the Dulles Access Road many times. The original "right of way" was of course obtained by condemning hundreds of properties in the 1950s to make way for the Dulles Access Road. Burbclaves like Reston and Herndon later grew up on either side of the condemned right of way, and had only limited connections to each other.
If the new toll road is using the original condemned right of way, then my point stands. The new developers presumably bribed the right officials and contributed to the right election campaigns so as to piggyback on the original statist action.
If the new toll road is NOT on the orginal right of way, and passes through the various neighborhoods like Herndon, Reston, and Vienna, then I would be very interested in just how they bought up thousands of houses, cut through dozens of surface streets, and generally cut a new swathe through a suburban area.

I said I saw the same thing in Berkeley and Santa Cruz. Both are said to be "progressive" communities, but in both places the so-called community garden areas are essentially for hoboes and deadbeats to scratch at.
Why would a "clean and sober" person (I'll call them this instead of "gentrified") want to go dig in the dirt where the dogs have crapped, where the addicts have shot up, and where their best tomatoes and zuchinis and whatnot get filched by the bums and addicts?
Real people find garden space to plant in.
My general point remains: why "argue" with the city government about when you can access your communal, collective property, or what you can spray on it, or which vegetables are said to be "conflict vegetables" (seeds from some zone the U.N. has declared un-P.C.) (*), when you can simply find a 5 x 9 plot of land, or lease it, and not have to ask (I'm joking about "conflict vegetables." But ever since all the various PC television shows and movies started nattering about "conflict diamonds," I have realized this is just another PC scam. If I buy diamonds from Zaire I don't give a hoot in hell that they were  bought from "capitalist roaders" or whomever the U.N. has declared to be politically incorrect. Seeing a James Bond movie centered around "conflict diamonds" made me ill.)

Yes, many such uses by private actors, via bought and paid for public There have been several publicized cases where a longstanding store or restaurant was seized by eminent domain, razed, and then the land has yet to be built upon. Small town residents in one area saw an important store (hardware, I think) seized and razed and now, years later, just an empty lot with no sales or property tax coming in, no employees, and no hardware store. (I think the plan had been for some large box store, but the chain decided the town only could support a smaller-sized store, which was now gone.)
I met some Silicon Valley friends for lunch a few days ago. We went to a small place near a set of "out of place skyscrapers" which had been heavily subsidized by a local government. The restaurant was virtually empty, and the owner/chef came out to our table (he knew one of our party from years back) to launch into his tale of woe.
For those who know the area, we ate in an old shopping complex called "Town and Country Village," in Sunnyvale, near Mathilda Avenue and Central Expressway. The old T & C Village had fallen onto hard times over the past 20 years, replaced by newer centers. So Sunnyvale decided to subsidize a builder to erect some 6-story office buildings. Three or four massive towers--massive compared to what's all around for a mile or two--got built. And now they are largely empty.
Here's the "dot com explosion" optimistic report on this project:
Anyway, this restaurant owner was telling us how the town gave him various inducements to open a restaurant to serve the lunch crowd from these several skyscrapers. (Apparently when government gets into the building business it also must worry about how to feed the workers. True in ancient Egypt, true today.)
Since the buildings sit nearly empty, many of the new restaurants and delis and lunch places are failing.
Which is all evolution in action, except that government should not be in the construction and business development business. (I would go further and say that nothing in the U.S. Constitution, which states and localities are bound by, justifies taking money from citizens to give to businesses. No matter "how smart an investment" it looks to be. Ditto for governments running gambling operations, but I digress.)
According to news reports on this area, Sunnyvale is still losing money on a major indoor mall it built 23-4 years ago ("Sunnyvale Town Center," which I used to live a mile or so away from when it was being built in the late 70s.
IMO, there's something very, very wrong about any level of government building shopping malls.

A superficially good idea ("sounds good!"), but ultimately silly.
Government bans gambling, or heavily regulates it, or declares illegal the exact odds it grants itself.
Lotteries, for example, are the ultimate sucker bet. The payoff is a miniscule fraction of what is betted, and then to add insult to injury, governments state the payoff as "twenty million dollars!!!!" when the actual anuity value is something like $8 million. (Because they declare the 20-year payout as the prize. A casino which tried this, or a private lottery company, would be prosecuted for fraud.)
Having government make gambling illegal but then operate gambling operations is no different from making prostitution illegal but then running brothels.
I admit it is useful as an illustration of the hypocrisy and dishonesty of government, but I believe all of those who have been involved in government-run gambling where gambling is otherwise illegal should be prosecuted and imprisoned. Several million should be sent to prison for exactly the crimes they send civilians to prison for.

Declan described the same thing I see. And my brother in LA is a traffic engineer, one responsibilty being traffic issues in and around such "homeless gardens." He reports even worse situations.
You still have not explained why government-operated gardens are a good idea. Believe me, there is plenty of land in America, even in cities. And markets solve the problems you described (arguing with city planners about fertilizers and times of operation).
I gave an example of a garden plot and you argue for statism on the grounds that my example is too small.
A 5 x 9 raised bed plot is much larger than most people can handle as a hobb, while doing other things in their life. If they need large amounts of space, even more justification for doing things (My sister sublet her couple of acres just north of Sacramento to a Hmong family. Sure enough, several members of an extended family worked their gardens many hours a week. This is not "hobby" or "incidental" gardening, this is food production for sale at farmer's markets. Which is fine, but it is not the job of a city to buy land to let food producers farm it. It's also not the job of a city to acquire land for hobby producers, either, lest there be any doubt.)
You were the one complaining that you had to argue with the communal czars about fertilizer usage and hours of operation. This is like arguing with a "community television board" about which channels are acceptable and which are not, and what the hours of operation should be, when the obvious and cypherpunkish solution is to bypass the community board and and get a satellite dish with Playboy, CNN, Spice, ESPN, and 200 other channels.
Or to acquire your own land, or go in with others, where you can set your own policy on fertilizers and operating times.
You remind me of the small-town busybodies who attend city council meetings and argue endlessly about what software should be on the "community" computers, when of course the answer is obvious: "none, because it is not the job of government to provide "community access" to computers."

Around 1982 a friend of mine was proposing to convert a "cherished" ocean front dirt lot (something the commies here would like a lot) into a "nuclear-powered whale-packing plant." Even his lefty friends laughed.
(Details for the interested. This was Lighthouse Field, which was "saved" from development by Santa Cruz lefties, lesbians of color, and other folks Harmon Seaver and "Tyler Durden" would no doubt like very much. Today the field is a major homeless camp, needle park, and dog crap zone. And the city, which has not allowed a new hotel or conference center in decades, is in dire financial straits. But, hey, they stopped the evil capitalists from buying the privately owned land! Their neighbors down the coast also stopped a private owner from reasonably developing his land into a set of performance stages, hotels, conference centers, etc. He went bankrupt after his land use was blocked, the site is now choked with weeds and needles, there is no beach access at the site, and the community is squawking that there are no "stages" and "performance venues" for the community. I'd take everyone involved in blocking Wingspread, the project, and have them hanged for stealing Ry Kelley's property. I figure killing the 50 or 70 major culprits would send a message. Cryptoanarchy will someday mean the millions who need to be punished for their crimes will in fact be punished and converted into fertilizer, soap, lampshades, and other things which can be sold to partially pay for their crimes.)

I played the California Lotto game once, shortly after it started (mid-80s, as I recall). I wanted to see what the tickets looked like and whether in fact there was a hash (or other variant of crypto) on the back, as I had heard there was. Yep, for a dollar I confirmed this. I lost the losing ticket amongst my stuff many years ago.
(The idea is an obvious one to our crowd. Suppose the winning number is "foobar," in some likely base. Any clod who hears this is the winning number can then use a good printer and make his own winning ticket, or so he thinks. But only the "mint" is able to generate the _other_ number, call it "foobaz,"  which is either a hash with a secret key of "foobar" or is otherwise computed from "foobar." John Koza, the genetic programming guy at Stanford who has authored several books on the subject, started a Gilroy-based company called Scientific Games, which did a lot of the work on lotteries and their tickets. Now they own several other betting companies. Koza sold out at least 15 years ago and concentrated on genetic programming (which has nothing to do with Scientific Games or lottery tickets).)

The states also established state religions and banned books, in the century or so for it to shake out in the Supreme Court that when the states agreed to support the Constitution as a condition for joining the Union it meant that they really did have to support the The Bill of Rights is quite clear that powers not specifically granted to government by the Constitution don't exist.
While building canals is arguably related to national defense and the common good (though I think private actors are better suited to build canals, and railroads, etc.), running gambling operations while declaring gambling immoral and illegal is clearly nonsensical and (I think) unconstitutional. Regrettably, the political stooges who sit on the Supreme Court have put considering this business of government running gambling dens about  on the list of probably unconstitutional things to look at.
(I think the courts should hold personally liable those who pass unconstitutional measures. Imprisoning those who commit acts later declared to be unconstitutional might disincentivize them to blithely pass unconstitutional bills.)
To repeat, government cannot declare gambling a social evil which must be banned and then turn around and set up its own gambling operations.
Everyone involved in the many state gambling operations should receive sentences no less harsh than those imprisoned on gambling charges. This would mean most would die in prison. Except for those who ought to be killed for their other substantial crimes, this would be a good thing.
"I was just following orders" is, of course, not a defense. The lowliest lottery clerk should receive the same multi-year prison sentence that a Mob numbers runner would receive.

We hold corporate employees liable for criminal acts. Why should government employees be exempt from the same standard? And why should a judge who is able to withstand pressures not to sentence corporate employees to prison be unable to withstand similar pressures when it comes to government employees?
There are issues of separation of powers, what with the judiciary thus having some power to imprison legislative members, but this is not a new issue. Judges have sentenced members of the legislature and the executive branch to prison for various offenses, including bribery, corruption, perjury, etc.
The business of legislators passing new laws when other essentially identical laws were struck down, just to show their constituents that they are "doing something" or "helping to save the children," has got to stop.

I would craft the rules for prosecution so as to cut Leahy a break on this, as it was the _first_ time the "morphed child-like images" law was tested. (Assuming for the sake of argument this was in fact the first such law...I dimly recally morphed images being outlawed half a dozen years ago in another law.)
My main point was not to criminally prosecute those who pass laws _later_ found to be unconstitutional, when tested for the first time, but to prosecute those who keep passing the same unconstitutional laws. They know the laws "won't pass constitutional muster," as the lingo goes, but they get enough other career criminals to sign on anyway.

And, yes, I would object just as strongly if _literate_ PRs, or literate Europeans, or anyone, stopped me and demanded to know my business. The point about them being illiterate PRs is that it's crystal-clear this is just a gang with a nominally "pro law and order" slant. Exactly as if the Bloods or the Crips became enforcers for the power structure.
They look like Hitler Youth, although both Curtis and Lisa are getting The issue of whether a group like Sliwa's or the border ranchers is a posse, a gang, a neighborhood watch group, a vigilante force, or a right-wing militia is all in the act of naming.
If they're keeping out wetbacks from crossing their lands, more power to them. Shoot to kill, night vision, all that good stuff.
If they stop me from walking on a public street and tell me I have to explain to them to their satisfaction what I am doing in "their" neighborhood, they have earned killing.
It's as simple as that.

@_subject: Economics of "Wanted" and "Unwanted" Messages 
I'm reading with only 10% of my brain engaged the many (and oft-repeated) articles about how Hash$ash or MailBucks or whatever will "fix" the spam problem.
First, what is the spam problem? It's the receipt of unwanted messages, like a celebrity receiving unwanted attention when he walks in public. (Issues of his choice to appear in public are not central to the argument. He receives attention because his name and face is known to many. A "many to few" problem, just as more letters are sent to the New York Times than to me.  Ordinary people don't get bothered on the street because they are not one of the relative handful of celebrities.
With e-mail, we're all celebrities. Rather, the costs of sending (contacting) are so low that we can all become celebrities to a subset of stalkers.
The analogy with celebrities is intentional. Their are three main approaches for dealing with the problem of unwanted attention towards 1. Pass laws making it a crime to approach a person unless one has good reason to. Courts decide who is authorized or justified. This is the "unsolicited e-mail is a crime" approach.
2. Celebrities have agents who screen all potential contacts for the right amount of attention, deals, cocaine, or other forms of "consideration." This is the HashCash approach. "Pay me to be 3. Reclusiveness. Celebrities live behind guarded walls, or on their own Bermuda or Bahamas island estates. When in Hollywood or London, they stay in 5-star hotels with rigorous screening of who gets to their floor. This is the "spam filter and personal responsibility" approach.
Now it may be sad that Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones choose to live on Bermuda, in a walled compound no less, but this is the price of notoriety.
As for complicated schemes involving using CPU resources to compute cryptographic numbers and thus decide whether a sender was sufficiently motivated or not, this is nonsense. If I recognize a sender's name, I am likely to read his mail, regardless of whether my 1 GHz G4 decides that he did not spend enough of his own CPU resources in contacting me. And if I see a bunch of Chinese characters in the message, or I see it is from a name I don't recognize, I will likely click on "Think of this kind of message as Trash" and will never again see this kind of message. (I use OS X Mail, a descendant of NeXTMail, and it has this kind of Bayesian filtering built in and easy to use.)
If and when spam from harvested messages gets to be too great, I expect I'll change my e-mail address again. (My spam dropped from about 100 per day to about 1 per day when I changed my 7-year-old address of "tcmay at got.net" to "timcmay at got.net."  It hasn't gone up in the past few months. This suggest to me, BTW, that maybe a lot of the spam is using a relatively static list harvested a while back. Which makes sense. Those selling "500 million e-mail addresses for $29.95" have no real incentive to try to keep current: they are selling to dummies trying to sell fake Viagara sugar pills to suckers. Maybe they're selling each other the same lists of harvested addresses during the dot com peak? Just a thought.)
The fundamental flaw which is leading to the spam problem is that sending a million messages costs very little, not that recipients are not "charging" for e-mail. If bandwidth actually cost money, if various links in sending either JPEGs or copies of the Koran or e-mail actually were charged, a lot of the "ontological" problems with free mail would be lessened.
Notice that I am NOT saying that all carriers should charge. Indeed, whether they carry traffic for free or charge for it, and how they charge, is their business.
Whether on the uplink (sending) or downlink (receiving) or in the middle side, that some traffic is charged for, and must be paid for somehow, should be enough to fix things.
The reason we don't get inundated with hundreds of pounds of physical junk mail each day is that there are ontological limits on sending of physical goods, on consuming of physical resources. (And learning takes place. A few years ago I was getting 10 times as much weight in glossy catalogs. I surmise that some of the glossy catalog makers gave up on sending expensive catalogs, for which they also had to pay postage, to tens of millions of potential customers.)
On the downlink side, I expect my ISP is not much interested in trying to charge me or the sender for the e-mail I receive. But on the uplink side, on the side which fires off a million e-mails, I wonder why they don't try to charge the sender?
And why traffic in between, bouncing amongst nodes, is not charge for? (Such charges would eventually force backwards a charging mechanism, of whatever form, a la the arguments by Hardy, Tribble, etc. for "digital silk road." Nobody expected the camel caravan from Tashkent to Baghdad to carry stuff for free. So why is it expected that 50 GB of JPEGs and e-mail should travel for free on the Net?
Long term, unwanted communication comes with the "celebrity" effect. Greg Egan describes it well in "Permutation City": a constant barrage of agents attempting to make contact, with movies, fake voices, and every other possible trick. And so the spam filters will spend more time filtering. (And getting rid of the socialized "all bits are carried for free" pricing policy at least solves the worst of the ontological problems.)
Should crypto people be worrying about how nodes on the Net charge for traffic? Maybe. But it won't involve "HashCash" tokens. For the 99.99% who never bother with the complications of crypto and signatures, convincing them to learn about how to use HashCash will be 100 times harder a sell. And if some mail system tries to ram it down the throats of the users, they'll find alternatives.

"Disney says that their market research shows that films they are  planning to introduce with EZ-D are films no one in their right mind  would _want_ to watch a second time, let alone keep. "We found that 85%  of our test subjects stopped watching "The Hot Chick" less than 30  minutes into the playing, and that 97% of those who finished watching  "Signs" turned to their friends and family and said "That was really,  really lame.""
I would not want to be the reliability engineer on this product. What  happens when a batch goes bad before the official 48-hour expiration?  And since oxidation (rust) is an Arrhenius process (activation energy,  the usual rate proportional to exp (- activation energy/kT)), storing  the disks in a hot car or even just a non-air-conditioned house could  cause it to oxidize many times faster than when storing it in a cool  place. Or, as others have noted, in a  freezer.
Seems to me it could be fun to rent some of these Disney turkeys, force  them to wear out (rust) much faster than normal, then go to the rental  place with a wild, crazed look and tell the manager: "THESE WON'T  FUCKING PLAY, ASSHOLE. YOU HAVE RIPPED ME OFF. GIVE ME ALL OF MY MONEY  BACK OR YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS BURNS TO THE GROUND. GOT IT, ASSHOLE?"

@_subject: Underestimating long-term consequences of cryptoanarchy 
Actually, I wasn't very concise. I listed a laundry list of loosely-related ideas...somewhere in there is a coherent and concise However, since some of the ideas have won their authors Nobel Prizes in Economics, and since they themselves have not distilled the point into a single theorem (a la Coase's Theorem, which is also related, but I won't get into that here), listing the examples is all that I could do.
The general theme is purpose "the purpose of life." The purpose of any lifeform, or at least the outcome after competition and selection, is furtherance of life. Whether genotype or phenotype, whether actual instance of a lifeform or the DNA.
The purpose of a U.S. politician is to be reelected. Nothing else matters. So the politician will say anything he has to say to be reelected. And he will spend money that is not his own to be reelected.
Likewise, the purpose of Congress as a generalized lifeform is to perpetuate itself, to grow, to become more dominant. It passes laws to insulate itself from competition, it spins a web of confusing and conflicting laws to ensure its survival.
The purpose of the judicial system is to ensure its role as the priesthood, interpreting the confusing and conflicting laws as the seers and priests of ancient times interpreted the signs of the gods.
And so, for lifeforms such as the U.N., the Hague, Saddam Hussein and his Baath Party, etc.
This is Nietzsche's "Beyond Good and Evil" writ large. Politicians mouth words about good and evil and morality and campaign reform and protecting the children, but the real reason they act is out of self-interest. This is the larger theme behind all of the examples Declan says I concisely described.
The key is to place limits on this ability to act as a devouring Most libertarians are, I think, aware of this at a deep level. Most favor the Cincinnattus approach to government: Cincinnattus (spelling?) was the Roman general who wanted to work his farm. Other Romans, in Rome, wanted him to lead Rome. He did so, for some amount of time (I forget how long), then went back to his farm.
However, most politicians view politics as their life's work...or at least the best-paying job they're ever likely to get. A Congressvarmint earns something like $130,000 a year, plus numerous fringe benefits (cars, staff, fuckable interns, speaking engagements which pay more $$$, graft opportunities, junkets to Carribbean islands, and so on). A moderate dullard like Gary Condit from Modesto, California can do better as Congressman, distributing other people's money to whomever will suport his continuing career, than he can as a fertilizer salesman in his home town (like that other famous Modesto resident, Scott Peterson, accused of killing his wife Lacy).
Hence Washington, D.C. is itself a lifeform, intent on surviving, growing, solidifying its power, proliferating, and generally acting as invasive weed. Political kudzu. Instead of meeting for a few months out of each year, with the politicians otherwise back in their home districts, it's of course a year-round affair now, with most of the politicians (and their staffs, who are about 20 times as numerous, more if departments of the Executive branch are counted) making the political capital their primary residence. With many who lose in elections remaining in Washington as undersecretaries of something (I just noticed Asa Hutchinson, a former Congressman, is now some kind of undersecretary at HHS) or as think tank employees...they would rather stay on in McLean or Adams-Morgan or Bethesda or Vienna than go back to Skedunktity Junction, Tennessee.
I hesitate to call this a "bionomic interpretation," especially as I never really bothered to learn what "bionomics" was all about, but it's a kind of biological interpretation.
Or, quoting Nietzsche once again, it's a "will to power."
(No accident that N. was the first profound thinker to come after Darwin restructured everything people had thought about the world.)
Entities at nearly all levels seek power, seek life, try to suppress competition. The challenge is to find ways to limit the grown of invasive weed entities like government (of whatever ideological form...the Baathists were in many ways no worse than the Republicrats).
Ayn Rand expressed this in terms of disputing altruism, which is the flip side of saying that organisms seek power or act in self-interest. (She was a Nietzschian, at least originally, but later found something to disagree with him about, and in typical Rand fashion, declared him to be some kind of corrupt thinker. Hilarious.)
So, Declan, this is a less concise, restatement of the examples.
Again, close to "public choice theory." But also close to natural selection. And ultimately, a market system (of sorts, with various distortions caused by men with guns).
Where crypto comes in, of the form we call anarchocapitalism or cryptoanarchy, is that it short-circuits or bypasses some of the centralized control mechanisms. Which is not altogether new, as the telephone did this, as decentralized distribution did, and so on. (Which is a reason Russia had but one major city that all sought to move to, but the U.S. has long had many major cities....most people I know have no stinking desire to live in either Washington or NYC or LA.)
But relating crypto and digital money and data havens to political ideology is another major topic, so I'll stop here.
However, you mention nanotechnology, which I have had some interest in for a couple of decades (via Eric Drexler, Ralph Merkle, Ted Kaehler, and the nanotechnology discussion group in Palo Alto in the early 90s), so I will make a few comments:
Some of the nanotech advocates have long-argued for a "Moonshot" approach, an Apollo Program for nanotech. Gag! We tried to argue with them that this was a terrible idea, that Apollo _itself_ was a terrible approach to going into space in general.
The chip industry did not need significant amounts of government money.
It is an oft-repeated and bogus claim that chips came from government money. While government spent some money buying circa-1960 technology for Minuteman missiles, for example, the commercial development was way ahead. I could give a dozen more examples. Anyone who was at either Fairchild or TI in the 60s or Intel or Mostek or AMD in the 70s could trivially dispute the claim that the core developments of those decades came from government largesse.
Most of the important spending in Silicon Valley was not of research, but was of _feeders_. By this I mean the rise of various companies supplying feedstocks: silicon wafers of sufficient purity, liquid nitrogen (even plumbed under some streets by vendors), photoprojection printers, test equipment, pure chemicals, laminar flow hoods, and on and on.
It is this _ecology_ of suppliers and customers that gave us the striking advances in chip technology (and similar advances in aircraft, in biotech, in computers in general, in software, and so on).
By contrast, Apollo gave us a dozen spacecraft, of which half were used.
Nanotech will need the same ecology of suppliers and customers cited above. Government cannot provide this.
However, it is in the interest of some "nanotech leaders" that they be the ones to disperse the money of others, that they become the dominant nanotech lifeform. Whether individuals or committees (some in Washington, even), they will seek to perpetuate and expand. (In some cases, the "nanotech leaders" will be the Congressmen who try to build a career, and later business gig, on shaping nanotech policy. In other cases, it will be early pioneers of nanotech who are unhappy with the industrial focus of work and wish to get it back it back to the pure vision (I decline to name a name here). In other cases, it will just be the usual plodders and dullards who see setting nanotech policy as their only hope for some measure of job security. We've seen this many times before.
(Which is not to say this did not happen during the rise of Silicon Valley. In fact, companies and those in them would like to do the same thing. There is no doubt that my former employer, Intel, would like to be the dominant lifeform for at least as long as the remaining careers and retirement living of its employees! I, too, would like to see it continue to dominate--at least until I can sell my remaining stock! This is not surprising. Altruism is not why companies like Intel or Apple or Microsoft exist. However--and this is important!--they lack the power to force their customers to continue to buy from them, as companies like Packard (the car company, not the monitor company) and U.S. Steel and United Airlines found out. Or, in the chip business, as Mostek and Monolithic Memories and Rheem Semiconductor found out. This is the difference between "markets with coercion" and "markets without (There are deep, and unexplored here, connections between the initiation of force and distortions of markets. Organisms have long used force--claws and teeth and clubs and guns--as a means of competing for food or mates, for controlling territory, for collecting rent.  Much could be said here about the connections with initiation of force, Schelling points for rights in uncoerced transactions, the role of untraceability (and hence unreachability in the physical world) in some of the interesting crypto uses, and anarchocapitalism in general. We seek ways to reduce or remove the ability of men with guns to force us to give them money or other things of value.)
Yep, this author is making the same list of points I made: rent-seeking, public choice theory, dangling money...all part of the general will to power principle.
Rest of article not commented on.
I urge Cypherpunks to listen to their (likely) natural inner voices telling them government subsidies have rarely worked and have often done great harm.
No government funding for nanotech, or digital money, or _anything_.
So, this article is no longer concise. Such is life.

The Oregon law makes a very broad class of forms of civil disobedience--including unscheduled gatherings which disrupt traffic, sit-ins in colleges, marches, etc.--the same as blowing up buildings or crashing airliners, and carries a mandatory, no parole, minimum of 25 years incarceration. After 25 years, the possibility of being a slave laborer (in effect) picking up trash and cutting brush for the state of Had this law been in effect in America's past, very broad classes of public protest could have resulted (and _would_ have resulted, had the law been enforced uniformly) in life sentences (with possible parole as a brush cutter) for hundreds of thousands of those engaged in public acts of protest.
It may not be desirable that a bridge, for example,  gets shut down by marchers who pour into the streets, but it sometimes happens. The proper punishment is a fine for disorderly conduct, or a couple of nights in the local jail. Not placing them on the same footing as someone who crashes a plane into a building or releases Sarin in a This proposed law gives the authorities the power to pick and choose whom they wish to "terrorize" with a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 25 years of incarceration followed by the rest of their working life (as I read the language) as a forest laborer.
When in 1970 I was at a Mobilization rally against the war, and when our numbers forced various shut downs of streets (not included in the "rally permit"), anyone who "knowingly participated in" this rally when "at least one of the participants" blocked a highway or street, I and 350,000 other participants would have faced a mandatory life sentence....had the law been applied uniformly as written.
(The language in the PDF version, not included here because of the PDF/TIFF/JPEG-only options, does not say the law applies only to the ringleaders or main planners. It specifically includes "participation in" any event at which the described blockages or interruptions of transportation, education, etc. occur.)
So, when in 1972 several thousand students at my campus briefly closed Highway 101 in Santa Barbara, under this law they could/would all face mandatory life sentences, under this kind of law.

The purpose of this proposed law is clearly to intimidate nearly any form of public gathering which has any chance of "getting out of Perhaps they were attempting to make Portland a candidate for international trade meetings, such as the ones where anti-free trade protestors caused blockages of roads.
Whatever. The effect is to terrorize people into avoiding any form of protest which _might_ get out of control, or where at least one protester may go too far.
The purpose is to squelch speech. This is the point of saying the terrorism charges are applicable to all participants, not just the actual and most blatant offenders.
And I expect the Supreme Court will agree with me that this terrorism law is grossly unconstitutional.
(The Boston Tea Party presumably disrupted traffic in and around the port where it happened. King George would have loved a law which gave him the power to imprison for life all of the participants on "terrorism" charges. With some of them let out after 25 years to work his tobacco farms.)
Those who pass laws like this ought to be taken out and hung. Even if the hanging party disrupts traffic. Heh.

My recollection is that Oregon has legalized/recognized homosexual "marriage" and "right to die" schemes.
The Willamette Valley, where most of the population is, is fairly libertine. Most San Francisco types fit in quite well in Eugene, Portland, Beaverton, Corvallis, etc.
The coastal fishing and logging areas are now more dominated by tourism and retirement (from California). The eastern half of the state is largely high desert, and is sparsely populated.
I would not class Oregon with Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, etc. (and Montana is becoming more like California and the Pacific Northwest, as wealthy Californians buy ranches and retirement homes there--too cold for me, but they like the "Big Sky Country," until too many people move in, that is).
I think Ernest Callenbach had it about right when he described the region from British Columbia down through most of coastal California as "Ecotopia." (Or maybe this was the book called "The Seven Nations of North America"...I lent my copy to someone and never saw it again. Extreme southern California has more of a Mexican flavor and is dubbed "Aztlan" or somesuch word and is lumped in with Arizona, southern Nevada, New Mexico, etc.)
The meta-issue is of course that all of these states, and all of the nations of the world, have set up machines for producing more and more laws and more and more priests to interpret the laws. Didn't we basically have enough laws 40 years ago? Granted, some new situations came up, and new legislation was needed, but not in proportion to the numbers of new laws and the nearly year-round meeting of legislators to pass more laws.
The mischief that all the new legislation about Patriot Acts and Terrorist Information Awareness and Bill 742 is creating will never be undone. The Supreme Court lacks the guts to take on sweeping cases and strike down thousands of very similar and very unconstitutional laws across the country.
A good example, one of many, being the bullshit about the "incorporation doctrine" and whether the Second Amendment prevents _states_ from violating the Bill of Rights in the same way--it has been accepted--that the states may not establish official churches or deny due process, blah blah. Not being a law student, it has always seemed clear to me that the states agreed to support the Constitution of the United States as a condition for joining the Union and they clearly cannot impose their own press censorship, official religions, etc., nor can they violate the Fourth Amendment and just raid houses as they wish. Nor can their courts ignore jury trial and other constitutional issues. So, somehow the Second Amendment is deemed to be "unincorporated" (??). How con-veeeenient!
The Supreme Court should issue a simple and concise statement:
"The Second Amendment is no different from the First, Third (quartering troops), Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, etc. amendments. Some of the states do not seem to have grasped this. And we have been remiss in not making this abundantly clear a long time ago. .... We hereby instruct the Federal Marshals Service to visit the various prisons in states which have gun laws violating the Second Amendment and release the prisoners. We further order...and we order...and those officials which ignore this order shall be charged...."
But of course the Supreme Court is unwilling to rock the boat. And now that we have the Colored Person Slot, the Jewish Person Slot, the Female Slot, the Jewish Female Slot, the Italian-American Slot, various groups are clamoring for the Queer Slot, the Hispanic Slot, the Hispanic Woman Slot, and, of course the Asian Person Slot.

Or, rather, why I would likely do poorly in law school, and even if I managed to pass, would likely hate the kinds of b.s. little trials that 99% of lawyers have to work on to earn a living.
In writing that last mini-rant about the Second Amendment and the "incorporation doctrine" and why the courts have not made it clear that states may not violate the Second any more than they may violate the First or the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, etc., I realized something expressed by this analogy:
memorizing baroque law:understanding principles of systems :: memorizing baroque Unix and security protocols:understanding physics and math.
In English, the talent for being able to memorize a lot of often confusing and contradictory law is related to the talent for being interested in basic economic or system principles in the same way that the talent for understanding arcane Unix and security protocols is related to the talent for understanding math or physics.
I confess, I'm not a "Unix geek." I skip most messages which talk about SSL, DNS, and the intricacies of Linux or BSD or the like. More and more "security" and crypto seems to be about this kind of stuff.
It reminds me a lot of the law, where one just has to absorb thousands of cases and bits of "lore" about precedents and statutes. I would bog down, I expect, in not being able to simultaneously grok the Bill of Rights AND the aforementioned "incorporation doctrine" mess.
Also, unlike many in the law business (at least as I see them being interviewed on video and in print), I don't see any "majesty" in the law. What I see instead is a massive deviation from the "kernel" of a largely self-running machine based on core (kernel) principles of "you leave me alone and I'll leave you alone" kinds of Schelling points.
The law has become a baroque collection of "buttinsky" exceptions and mix-ins and overrides. (A mess of "before" and "after" methods, in Lisp Now I don't mean to insult any of those here who can write learnedly about the Unix-flavored hacks and about all nine layers of TCP/IP (or is TCP/IP just one of the layers of some other byzantine cake?

The world needs all kinds. And right now, security and crypto seems to be mostly about knowing lots and lots of pieces of cruft.
I surmise that the same skills--including the ability to absorb seemingly unrelated and even contradictory bits of stuff--useful for programmers are useful for lawyers. Which may be why several current or former Cypherpunks have become lawyers or are in law school.

Yes, I think the "will to power" is very strong. It's just that different people see it in different ways, and define "power" differently. In my case, I grew up knowing how atom bombs worked before I was 11 (well, I had a clear mental picture of chain reactions, and I was able to describe the "gun type" Little Boy device to my 5th grade class...though in retrospect I expect few of them understood what I was I thus grew up believing that science and math were the _real_ forms of magic and wizardry in the world, that while there are obvious no demons and warlocks and Lovecraftian mysteries, there are deep mysteries in the structure of the real numbers, compelling power in the nature of undecidable propositions, unbreakable boxes and impenetrable shields in the form of RSA, and, of course, powerful computers and magnificent H-bomb explosions. And so on, with DNA, engineering of bridges and ships, the mystery of turbulence in fluids, and on. (And now I'm excited, though I don't write about it much here for obvious reasons, that we may be on the verge of discovering what "money" really is, in terms of epistemic logic, possible worlds semantics, Bayesian belief networks, and topos theory. How can being an Assistant Undersecretary for Retired Schoolteachers Affairs possibly compete?)
It seemed terribly petty to me to want to control or have power over other people. (I practiced what I preach: when I was at Intel the top mgmt was constantly trying to get me to manage a lot of people. I hated managing other people. I hated having to tell them what to do, having to discipline them for coming to work late, all that jive. I only wanted to do my own projects, though I sometimes appreciated having technicians around as extra sets of hands to build equipment, help with experiments, take data, etc. But I generally hated having control over other people. I have none today, and this is fine with me. This does not contradict the fact that I would be more than willing to exert a certain kind of ultimate control--death administered by firearm--if the situation arose where it was justified. Which for me is anyone entering my house without my permission, anyone stealing from me, anyone trying to tell me what I can read and what I cannot. It's all consistent as far as I'm concerned.)
When I was interviewing college seniors and grad students for employment at Intel, a large fraction of the people gave as their goal "I want to work with people."
Gaack! I generally recommended for hiring (or further interviews) those who told me with some excitement what their Ph.D. thesis had been about, or what work had inspired them, or which classes they liked a lot. I might ask them what they thought of MOS versus bipolar, or about superconductivity and what the significance of Cooper pairs really was, in their opinion. If they were clueless, or bored, or nattered on about how much they wanted to "work with people!," I usually didn't recommend (I think some kids--and this was mostly in the years 1977-80--just had the idea that they were supposed to emphasize their "people skills" and to jabber about how much they liked the idea of being part of a team and all. It may have gotten worse after Personnel stopped favoring me as someone to go out to engineering campuses to recruit.)
And I think the political equivalent of this is having someone say "I want to do public service."
"Public service" meaning "'work in government."
Clearly the world is changed a lot more by the development of a new microprocessor or way of doing relational data bases than it is by some earnest young history major working her way up from GS-3 to an eventual GS-10 position as Administrative Assistant to the Deputy Director of Aptical Foddering, Near East Subdivision.
And why is is thought to be noble to work for non-market wages in an imperial city like Washington? (As most of you probably know, I spent most of the 1960s living near Washington. JFK did not impress me at all--a liar born with a silver spoon in his mouth, courtesy of his bootlegging father who then bought his way into respectability and the corridors of power, proving everything that is wrong about politics. Many of us were not sad to see Kennedy whacked. I was not impressed with Washington and I certainly had no desire to go back there to work. "Mr. Deeds Goes to Washington" never impressed me. A city of petty bureaucrats not working on anything important. )

Well, the Supreme Court, like most of U.S. law, is full of Any reading of the Bill of Rights shows that it is the _First_ which explicitly mentions "Congress shall make no law," not the Second. So we're all on the same page, here are the first several articles of the Bill of Rights:
Amendment I
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
Amendment II
A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be Amendment III
No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.
Amendment IV
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
So, any convoluted claim in Cruickshank or any of the other Reconstruction era decisions that somehow the Second only refers to what _Congress_ can do must explain why it is the First which mentions Congress while the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, etc., and most others (I'm not a Second Amendment scholar. I'd much rather practice shooting with night vision goggles than spend time trying to understand what some post-Civil War clowns decided. After all, look what Taney ruled on just before the War of Secession.)
By the way, I don't think even our current system would tolerate as Constitutional an Executive Order banning guns. The language of the Second doesn't give the Executive any special power to bypass it. Nor can any case be made the Second says "Congress shall make no law..." Again, the First has this sloppy language in it, but the second does not. (Though it has sloppy language including the useless but problematic bit about militias. It would be better if the Second simply said "The right of people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." (Not "the people," just "people." If "the people" is used, clarify that it means "individuals," not some weird collective right which translates to "the leaders of the people, especially their Jewish senators in California, shall have special rights the hoi polloi and negroes shall not have.")
(A better case, in terms of overly strict reading, would be that it is the _First_ which supposedly allows states and the Executive to ban churches, censor the press, etc., as they are not the Congress and the First explicitly mentions "Congress shall make no law." I'm not saying this would fly, and this was certainly not the intent, but the argument you give about the Second applies actually to the First. The Second is, in some ways, even more secure than the First, as it has no mention of By the way, a meta point, covered elsewhere in the Constitution, is that only the _Legislature_ (Congress) can make laws. The Executive Branch actually has no power to make laws, no power to ban guns, no power to define crimes.
To the extent this is still honored, the Executive branch seeks laws from Congress. The President then signs bills or not, and is sometimes To the extent this is _NOT_ honored, as in the rogue President Lincoln's suspension of fundamental rights and as in various Executive Orders and Double Secret Confidential Laws since then, most of the Executive lawmaking is done at what the political people call "the ministerial level." For example, the SEC and FDA and FCC creating laws in their ministries.
I don't believe either a Presidential ban or State bans are constitutional. Again, it is not the Second which mentions "Congress." That honor belongs to the First.
Could Nixon have ordered the NYT shut down when it was criticizing him so harshly? Could Clinton have announced that the Second Amendment was no longer valid? Could Bush have ordered citizens held in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments?
No, in all such cases. Of these examples, only Bush actually did what is suggested. He will be judged as harshly as we now judge Lincoln.
I only hope I someday see him tried and punished harshly, along with a few hundred of his brownshirts. A special wing at Supermax in Colorado needs to be built for these criminals.

Defending my property against trespassers is not the same class of thing as a march down a public street spilling over into another public street and thus causing traffic delays.

Something else that should be mentioned is the _economic analysis_ of silly proposals like Oregon's to make fairly minor transgressions or just associations into life sentence felonies:
It costs a _lot_ to imprison a person. A lot per year, a lot over 25 years, and a lot over a life sentence. It costs a lot in direct costs of operating a prison, it costs a lot in terms of the lost economic production and taxes of the incarcerated person, and it costs a lot in terms of intangibles for the society to have prisons filled with nonviolent, minor convicts.
If local communities  had to pay directly for the upkeep of prisoners things might be different. If a small town with a thousand residents and maybe 400 tax-paying households had to pay the $150,000 per year (rough estimate, could be low) to incarcerate Theresa Treehugger, they might complain to their legislature.
"Yep, we were required to build an extension to our jail to house the Terrorists from our community. Theresa Treehugger, over there in Annex B, used to be a programmer down in Silicon Valley. But she joined a protest march against the logging company, saying they had used imminent domain to seize a ranch. Someone in the protest dropped a tree across the Old Redwood Highway, shutting it for 3 hours. We never did find out who. But all 150 protesters were convicted under the Protection of the Environment and Safe Forests Act of 2003, so she's doing life without the possibility of parole in our little prison. We can't get fire sprinklers for the school cuz of her! And I hear that Annex B is filled up now and we've got four of those kids from the community college who participated in a frat party that got out of control and forced a delay in classes the next day. Yep, they were all convicted and got life sentences. Now we've got to come up with another $600,000 a year to deal with _them_!"
(Note that in actual small towns where local criminals actually _are_ incarcerated at town expense, instead of by some nebulous "society pays" system, it takes a fair amount to incarcerate a person. Drunks are released after one night in jail, village idiots are just that, and so on. Even a shoplifter probably ends up doing a few days's worth of hot, sweaty work on the County road crew and then thinks twice about whether stealing a pair of sunglasses is worth it. No small town would dare to incarcerate a college kid or Green Party activist for 25 years in their own jail for the "crime" of having been at a rally where someone went too far. The Oregon bill does not give the courts any such discretion, though, if the law is applied consistently.)
The issue is decoupling costs of the actual from abstract proposals.
California, for example, is building or subcontracting the building of numerous new prisons: the costs of felonizing more and more behaviors is not being felt directly. Rather, "everyone pays." A small town would likely not pay to put a pot smoker in its jail for several years, but by making the crimes "state" or "Federal" crimes the costs are transferred and obfuscated.
It's like the familiar example (used by me for many years, independent of the Wall Street Journal's nearly identical usage some years ago) of a party going to a restaurant and agreeing to split the check evenly. Diners are incentivized to order more expensive items, as their incremental cost is 1/N. Diners who might be trying to save money by ordering less expensive items find themselves screwed. Net result: the overall bill goes up. A classic game theory situation. Even worse is when society pays for the meals, as with health insurance (combination of subsidized health care and mandatory employer insurance, for When paying for a choice is decoupled from the choice, mischief occurs. Market economics 101.
In the case of Oregon's proposed new definition of terrorism and the draconian sentences intended to be meted out, those making the proposals and those voting to approve them don't have to _pay_ for incarcerating college kids and Green Party marchers for the rest of their lives.
This is the real act of terrorism.

No, absolutely _nothing_ in the First can possibly imply any "enforced delivery" or "obligation to read." I assume you are semi-joking, but this bears repeating, especially for those here who seem to be unclear on the concepts.
Secondly, most if not all of the "anti-spam laws" are, in fact, directly in contravention of the First Amendment. (This applies to out of country spammers, such as our friends like Dr. Igaboo Umbalago, Director of Petroleum Resources of Nigeria. Why this is so is not because the Nigerians are Americans but because "shall not be infringed" means that neither Congress nor the cops can set up screening operations to examine the content of mail or telephone calls: there simply is no authority for such things, which means those who send letters or e-mail or who make telephone calls from France or Nigeria or Taiwan are all de facto and de jure covered by the First. The "penumbra," some might call it.)
Several lists or groups I am are consumed by spam and anti-spam debates. Nearly all participants in the debate miss the importance of the First.
The First does not allow government to be in the content examination business. Those who think otherwise need....well, you all know what they need. I am serious. I am fucking sick and tired of bureaucrats, legislators, and even people on lists like this thinking that they have some authorization to examine the letters or e-mails I receive.

I guess I nailed it when I said "I assume you are semi-joking." Too bad, as there is certainly nothing which supports an "obligation to read" or "enforced delivery." More on this below.
??? The First quite clearly says that government can't be in the business of writing law about words, speech, etc. This then precludes any such laws by any branch of government. In other words, if the State of Georgia passes a law saying that recipients of letters or e-mails have an "obligation to read" them, this would rightly be struck down as a violation of the First. And if some radio station or printer were told he has an "enforced delivery" requirement, e.g., that he must print something or broadcast something, this would also be struck down. Ditto for e-mail. Granted, most ISPs will not pick and choose which e-mail to deliver, for various customer  happiness and practicality reasons, and because they don't typically examine content. But there is no "obligation to carry" traffic. Nor should there be. In fact, some ISPs throttle traffic when too many e-mails have been sent or received.
(By the way, speech laws about advertising, FCC rules, pornography look like counterexamples to the general point, allowing speech regulation, but they are not. One involves "commercial speech" (though I disagree completely). One involves allocation of the broadcast channels. And the pornography case has been contentious in First Amendment cases for well over a century. And to real First Amendment supporters, such laws are anathema. Of the three examples, only the FCC rules have any plausibility, having to do with scarcity of the broadcast spectrum...and there are some interesting free market/auction ideas there. With nonbroadcast channels, whether cable or fiber or DSL or whatever, there are no such scarcities: the owner of the channel charges for use of the channel. This is important to the spam problem.)
A law requiring that words be read _is_ a law about speech. Whether the law requires or forbids the reading of words, it is a law about speech and thus an abridgement of the freedom of speech. Nonspeaking and nonreading are precisely isomorphic to speaking and reading.
As a reminder:
--AMENDMENT I
  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
Of course. Much as my personally dislike receiving faxes I did not expect to get, any law about "unwanted speech" is a law restricting the freedom of speech. If it becomes a criminal matter for someone to receive an unwanted telephone call, or e-mail, or fax, then the First Amendment is lost.
(This space reserved for Choate to claim that I am saying people can stand outside my bedroom window at 3 a.m. sending me speech messages. No, I am not saying this. This is covered by other laws, and is a reasonable limit. But "unwanted communications" when no public disturbance is involved is not the same thing.)
You are well and truly lost. Their should be no "truth in advertising" laws whatsoever. Advertising is just speech. Government is not, and cannot be, in the business of determining which speech is true and which is not. Will praying to the baby Jesus bring salvation? Will using Bowflex make you a babe magnet? Will eating Twinkies increase your sex drive? None of these are matters for government to decide.
Anathema to nearly every technology we advocate, notably remailers and You are oblivious to the technologies we discuss here. I cite my own system, BlackNet, from 1993, as a counterexample to your claim.
Practically, even physical items can be shipped when no identifiable legal nexus exists. A lot of porn companies work this way, with cutouts and shell companies to escape regulation, taxes, etc. This doesn't mean customers don't receive the DVDs they order, though, even if the legal nexus is unreachable. Again, a matter of continuing repuational capital, however imperfect.
I know there are a lot of statists now on this list, but, really, at least try to relate your proposed statist laws to technologies we have discussed (and even implemented) here so many times.
UCE laws _are_ speech laws. Period.
The solutions are technological and economic. And, no, they don't necessarily involve some HashCash token. In fact, this flies against fundamental economic principles of markets, to establish arbitrary schemes and rates.
The fundamental ontology is what needs fixing. If a Nigerian spammer can pay his 100 oogaboogas per month (equivalent to $6.50/month, or whatever) and then send ten million messages out, this is between him and his ISP and all upstream carriers, a la standard economies, a la the silk road, a la the Digital Silk Road. That his ISP offers him this free access, or that someone he connects to does,  is no different from having a broken ontology where paying 100 oogaboogas a month entitles a Lagos-based shipper to fill as many cargo ships as he wishes with And the solution is NOT to regulate the cost of either cargo ships or ISP rates. This is not my problem, not my government's problem, and not the U.N.'s or WTO's problem. This is the ontology of that particular market and those players will solve it in time.
See Greg Egan's "Permutation City" for a near-future scenario, as a bit of background to the main story, where spammers use sophisticated A.I. methods to try to get past the A.I.-based filters of customers. Egan is wise enough to realize that none of the ill-considered A.U.C.E. schemes are going to make any real difference, long-term.
Filters and systems where people _voluntarily_ charge to look at incoming messages, will be the main approaches. I don't know precisely what the rates will shake out to be (in fact, they will vary widely) or how many other measures (filters, A.I.) will be used in conjunction with payment schemes, or how bandwidth providers will charge (and how much), but I sure do know that this free market approach is both more practical and more constitutional than the statist approaches are.

I hate being sucked into this ongoing spam debate, but there are just so many deeply wrong-headed memes floating around on this issue, and so much obvious chance for government mischief and intrusion, that I cannot resist adding more comments.
Item: State of California has just passed a law criminalizing certain kinds of speech, that is, something some legislators and judges deem to be "unwanted commercial messages." Other states passing similar laws. Talk of RICO prosecutions, seizure of assets, the usual War on Some Drugs kind of nonsense.
Item: How long before corporations cite spam laws to stop shareholders and customers from organizing campaigns against the corporations? If the CEO of McDonald's receives 10,000 letters from angry customers, is this spam? (I'll bet some of the major uses of the spam laws is along these lines, a kind of version of SLAPP suits (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation).
Item: Or is there some exemption for "political and social speech"? (I  haven't consulted the spam laws, but I assume there is some weasel language about "nothing in this legislation shall be construed to interfere with political advocacy....") And yet some of the most obnoxious messages I receive are NRA spam messages--they and other pro-gun groups have me on their mass mailing lists. Should they be allowed to send this spam? Or will some causes be judged politically incorrect? Is it OK to send thousands of spam pictures of aborted foetuses to abortion advocates?
Item: How about religion?
Item: If either political advocacy or religion is exempted, then spammers can insert religious messages into their spam. "Hello, I am Monsignor Ubalong N'fasti, Chief Prelate of the Catholic Church in Lagos, Nigeria. I am in urgent need of your assistance in continuing God's work in our country..."
Item: Spammers can exploit _any_ exemption in the legislation for religion, political advocacy, environmental advocacy, etc. Having legislators or judges or ministerial-level bureaucrats deciding which messages are "exempt from spam laws" and which are not would be a free speech disaster.
And so on. There are no good reasons for letting government decide which speech is political, which is advocacy, what is truth and what is --Tim May, Citizen-unit of of the once free United States

It's useful to remember that newspapers are commercial operations, e.g., the New York Times Corporation, and that the same arguments that commercial speech can be regulated would thus apply to newspapers....except this is not "regulate commerce" was intended to And of course book publishers and authors are engaging in commerce. By the logic that commercial speech is subject to regulation, very few things would be beyond the reach of censors and regulators.
(My informal understanding of the commerce clause is that it says only Congress may regulate tariffs and fees for commerce, that individual states may not do so. This was to preclude Virginia, say, from imposing a tariff on goods from Maryland. The commerce clause does not say that if a book publisher makes money ("commercial") that the words in the book can be regulated, censored, prior-restrained, etc. Of course, what has happened in the past several decades has been the extension of the commerce clause into areas it was not intended to go, such as laws restricting freedom of association (First A.) by claims that interstate commerce is affected by certain kinds of freedom of association, e.g., that a restaurant barring negroes would thus affect the purchase of napkins which would reduce business in nearby states which would affect interstate commerce. Of course, the same argument would imply that people should not be able to choose which motels to stay in or which restaurants to eat in or which books to buy, because all of these choices may affect "interstate commerce" and by the brain-damaged rulings of our courts only Congress may affect interstate commerce.)
The solution is of course to restate boldly that the commerce clause in the Constitution refers clearly to regulation of actual transport and shipment, of the sort between nations. Meaning, taxes and tariffs and import quotas and whatnot. And that the states do NOT have the power to act as nations do, that is, they have no power to regulate commerce...only Congress has that power.
All uses of the commerce clause involving limitations on free speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association, etc., would be ended.

I should have mentioned in my last response that there have already been cases where the "electronic vote results" were accidentally posted before the election polls had closed. This did wonders for belief in the system.
One of the reported cases was somewhat understandable, not that this affected overall suspicion of the system: some or most of the absentee ballots had already been counted and recorded into the electronic system. They were of course not supposed to be agglomerated with the other electronic vote totals until after the polls closed. Someone made a typical computer error and the partial totals were released ahead of the polls closing. Apparently some number of voters planning to vote thought the election was over and didn't vote.
Now with conventional, slow, paper-based systems of the sort we mostly still use in the U.S., there are various "ontological safeguards," or "speed bumps," which make this kind of "computer error" less of an Any computerized system is likely to have glitches like the above, each of which will cause some fraction of the electorate to think things are rigged. As they probably will be.
(By the way, there are some possible crypto fixes, such as "timed-release crypto." A beacon could broadcast an unlocking key at some time well after the polls had closed, simultaneously unlocking the many sealed ballot messages.

When California was considering a lottery to 'help the schools," I voted against it. On the grounds that if something is illegal (gambling, prostitution, copyright violation, etc.), governments shouldn't be running casinos or brothels or Napster services.
If governments act as bookies or slot machines, why not you and me?
(And if any private gambling operation used the deceptive bookkeeping the lotteries typically use, they'd be shut down for fraud. A slot machine which paid "$10,000....(paid over 20 years, or you can have $3481.98 _immediately_!)" would be shut down by the Gambling Commission in most states.)

I cannot claim to know what I would do, or will do, if Feds ever visit my home, but I hope I will have the presence of mind to tell them to:
a) get off my property
b) or to arrest me

Nothing in the Constitution allows compelled speech, except under limited (and I think unconstitutional) cases involving grand juries ordering a person to speak. (Or where use or blanket immunity has been granted, again, probably an unconstitutional measure, as it is compelling potentially self-incriminating evidence which may very well be used in either another case or be twisted to provide a basis for another case.)
I hope I will have the self-presence to say "You are trespassing. Get off my property, right now!"
Cooperating with cops snooping around looking for either thoughtcrime or "terrorist aid and support" is a lose, a big lose.
Speculating wildly, the real target may be John Young himself. And nearly anything he said to these narcs may be construed, by them and by their malleable DAs, as "lying to a Federal investigator."
People should not talk to the Feds. If the Feds come calling, refer them to one's lawyer. For those who don't have a lawyer on retainer, tell them that you need to consult with a lawyer first. Whether you do or you don't is beside the point. The point is to not talk to them.

Loosely related to this, I was at the Hackers Conference this past weekend. At my last attendance, two years ago, Mac Titanium Powerbooks were fairly abundant, but faced good competition from x86 laptops.
This time, whoah Nelly, hold the horses! There must have been 40 of them, from the small iBooks to the mid-sized Al- and older Ti-Powerbooks, to the mammoth 17-inch model. It was astounding to me, a long-term Mac user, to see the Mac laptops completely dominant. Looking into the audience, a sea of silvering Mac laptops with the distinctive white, illuminated Apple logo.
A big hit was "Etherpeg," from  which intercepts packets over a WiFi network and reconstructs the packets into JPEG images (if they exist). Since most of the Macs in the audience were on a local WiFi/"AirPort" network, arranged ad hoc, the output was put up on the LCD projector during one of the main talks. Images of naked chicks, oh my!

A few people had Debian Linux installed on their Mac Powerbooks, though they acknowledged that with OS X being built on BSD Unix, there was no actual need to have Linux.
Interestingly, there were virtually no desktops of any sort at the Conference. Partly this is logistical--people have to decide to transport their machines. But the reports that laptops are now accounting for 50% of Apple's sales are showing up in what I saw at the I hope Apple realizes the marketing edge they are gaining in some circles and doesn't do what Sony and IBM are doing.

Even 320 x 240 has more than enough resolution to show which boxes have been checked, or to mostly give a usable image with a printed receipt.
As for creating tamper-resistant and unforgeable and nonrepudiable voting systems, this is a hard problem. For ontological reasons (who controls machine code, etc.). I start with the canonical model of a very hard to manipulate system: blackballing (voting with black or white stones or balls). Given ontological limits on containers (hard to teleport stones into or out of a container), given ontological limits on number of stones one can hold, and so on (I'll leave it open for readers to ponder the process of blackball voting), this is a fairly robust system.
(One can imagine schemes whereby the container is on a scale, showing the weight. This detects double voting for a candidate. One lets each person approach the container, reach into his pocket, and then place one stone into the container (which he of course cannot see into, nor can he remove any stone). If the scale increments by the correct amount, e.g, 3.6 grams, then one is fairly sure no double voting has occurred. And if the voter kept his fist clenched, he as strong assurance that no one else saw whether he was depositing a black stone or a white stone into the container. Then if the stones are counted in front of witnesses, 675 black stones vs. 431 white stones is a fairly robust and trusted outcome. Details would include ensuring that one person voted only once (usual trick: indelible dye on arm when stones issued, witnesses present, etc. Attacks would include the Ruling Party depositing extra stones, etc. And consolidating the distributed results has the usual weaknesses.)
Things get much more problematic as soon as this is electronified, computerized, as the normal "ontological" constraints evaporate. Stones can vanish, teleport, be miscounted, suddenly appear, etc.
Designing a system which is both robust (all the crypto buzzwords about nonforgeability, satisfaction of is-a-person or one-person constraints, visibility, etc.) and which is also comprehensible to people who are, frankly, unable to correctly punch a paper ballot for Al Gore, is a challenge. I'm not sure either Joe Sixpack in Bakersfield or Irma Yenta in Palm Beach want to spend time learning about "all-or-nothing-disclosure" and "vote commitment protocols."
I know about David Chaum's system. He has gotten interested in this problem. I am not interested in this problem. Moreover, I think working on electronic voting only encourages the political process (though implementing wide computer voting and then having more of the "winning totals posted before polls close" exposures of shenanigans might be useful in undermining support for the concept of democracy, which would be a good thing.)
I don't say it's not a security problem worth thinking about. It reminds me a lot of the capabilities stuff, including Granovetter diagrams and boundaries. Probably a nice category theory outlook on voting lurking here (e.g., voting as a pushout in an appropriate category, or something whacky like that).
Electronic voting of the type being pushed now is going to cause some major loss of faith in the system when some scandals emerge (and when even analyzing the protocols and talking about what one has learned results in a "cyst and decease" order from Diebold and that ilk).

The "rules" are precisely what we are discussing.

Hollywood Preaches Anti-Piracy to Schools
Thu Oct 23, 3:09 PM ET
By RON HARRIS, Associated Press Writer
SAN FRANCISCO -  As part of its campaign to thwart online music and movie piracy, Hollywood is now reaching into school classrooms with a program that denounces file-sharing and offers prizes for students and teachers who spread the word about Internet theft.
The Motion Picture Association of America paid $100,000 to deliver its anti-piracy message to 900,000 students nationwide in grades 5-9 over the next two years, according to Junior Achievement Inc., which is implementing the program using volunteer teachers from the business   "What's the Diff?: A Guide to Digital Citizenship" launched last week with a lesson plan that aims to keep kids away from Internet services like Kazaa that let users trade digital songs and film clips: "If you haven't paid for it, you've stolen it."
The program appears to be working, with students in dozens of middle schools announcing that they will not enter their school libraries. Said one student: "These libraries let lots of kids read the same books...that's like Kazaa lets lots of people listen to songs!"
Another one added that they are joining a Christian Coalition program to shut down parties that other students run. "They are, like, letting kidz listen to music and stuff," said one banner-toting teenybopper.
TM: the last two paragraphs were of course added by me. But the point is still valid, that much of Hollywood's claims about "illegal listening" are not really any different from "reading without buying" books and magazines in libraries. The more urgent issue is this crap about corporations buying time in public schools. If I had a kid in a school and it was proposed that Nike, Time-Warner, Coke, or Intel would be buying teaching time, I'd tell them to stop it pretty fucking quick or face the Mother of All Columbines.

@_subject: "If you use encryption, you help the terrorists win" 
I predict we'll soon be seeing a new thought control campaign with this theme, that "if you use encryption, you help the terrorists win."
Similar to the heavy advertising (paid for by Big Brother, and hence by money stolen from taxpayers) with the theme that lighting up a doobie helps Osama, that taking an Oxycontin (sorry, Rush!) is equivalent to flying a plane into the World Trade Center.
Why encryption? Why now?
Perhaps Eric B. can comment on the status of encrypted cellphones, of whichever flavor, but it occurs to me that some people in Iraq desperately need them. I refer of course to those trying to expell the American soldiers occupying their cities and, as Anne Coulter put it and as senior Army officials agree, "occupy their country, take their oil, and convert them all to Christianity."
You see, the landlines and central offices were largely wiped out in the War for Oil. So what is now going in is what makes sense for nearly all developing--or flattened--countries: cellphones. The U.S. had plans for the contracts to deploy cellphones to go to American companies, but the local puppets must have had no fear of the Americans, as they went with a better bribe: mostly Arabic cellphone providers will deploy the initial system.
And of course this is why there are a lot of subcontractors with ties to the NSA, DIA, ASA, etc. now in Iraq monitoring communications. (Partly to track down Saddam's whereabouts, as he may use a cellphone, if he's careless. Recall the tale of Pablo Escobar.)
So, what would happen if even 5% of the cellphones were encrypted with a sufficiently-strong system (Eric's 3DES would presumably be enough)?
And if not encrypted cellphones, encryption of the usual sort, over I wonder what would happen to someone found carrying copies of PGP into (Which is not to say copies are not already widely circulating, or readily downloadable, etc.)
It seems clear to me that the puppet state of Iraq (maybe we could dub it "The Puppet Republic of Iraq"?) will not allow significant use of encrypted cellphones, or perhaps even encryption over networks. If the daily attacks on the crusaders continue to rise, and there appears to be some kind of coordination, the intelligence agencies will be called to task on why they are not intercepting (or jamming) the coordination If the expected attacks in Saudi Arabia and other soft targets happen on schedule in the next few weeks, we might even see reintroduction of crypto ban proposals inside the U.S.
We should not assume the war for crypto is won.

Be careful using the phrase "have to" in any discussion of legal issues.
Does government force libraries to pay more for some subscriptions? Not to my knowledge.
Do some publishers have different rates for individuals versus libraries and other institutions? Yes.
Are libraries required by law to reimburse authors and publishers when they allow books and magazines to be looked at by patrons or checked out by them? No laws that I know of.
In short, some publishers charge some customers more, and others less. In this sense, an Intel or a Carnegie Public Library "has to" pay higher rates to these particular publishers, but this is certainly not germane to issues of legality of libraries.

You are incorrect. "Both are illegal" is not correct. The Home Recording Act of 1992 explicitly made home use for noncommercial (no renting, no selling, no commercial use in bars or radio stations) fully legal. The text can be Googled and the topic has been covered here many In shyster terms, it created a "safe harbor" for home taping.
The HRA even established a "blank tape and media tax," which is why many CD-Rs sold say "Music" on them (ostensibly these are the media for which the blank media tax was paid by someone, with revenues ostensibly given to Hollywood).
The DMCA threw a spanner in the works in various ways, partly rewriting the HRA, partly adding new stuff.
But the existence of the HRA and the money sent to Hollywood and Nashville through the HRA music taxes make successful prosecution of any home taper nearly impossible.

And, practically, elections come at various times during the year in different states, with sometimes several elections in a year. Can't have a "mandated holiday" for each, right?
Further, even on mandated holidays, _some_ people must work just to keep the machinery going. Examples are legion, from cops to oil refinery workers to election place employees.

Second Suspect Arrested for Internet Virus
Wed Sep  3, 5:54 PM ET
By JIM KRANE, AP Technology Writer
  Police in Romania on Wednesday arrested a 24-year-old former student in connection with a computer-crippling Internet worm, according to a computer security company that aided police.
  Company analysts traced Ciobanu through some Romanian-language text inside the virus that eventually led them to a Web page containing Ciobanu's home address and telephone number, Vicol said.
--end excerpt--
Tim again: This is not the first time an arrest has been made based on comments in virus/worm code. Sometimes the comments are about professors, sometimes about girlfriends, sometimes about local food and other trivia.
It would be easy to implicate someone, for at least the initial months of house arrest (as with Parsons, the American kid also arrested for an alleged Blaster release), by scattering incriminating comments. Getting incriminating evidence onto their home or office computers is not as easy, but we can all think of ways this could be done.
Absent verifiable signatures on such code (who would sign such a thing with a traceably sig?), conviction may be difficult. A charged person could claim he was "set up."
Still, acquittal is months or years down the road, after great expense.
I'll bet we see something along these lines soon.

I'm not much interested in the machinations of the micropayment/digital cash markets, for reasons which should be clear. But I've certainly seen something very similar being played-out in the _language_ market  (what marketdroids would call "space").
All of the interesting languages now generating a lot of buzz, and substantial communities, are essentially "free." Or non-profit, or open source, or whatever one wishes to call them. Some examples:
* Python. I'm not a Python person, but a lot of my friends are. And the community is substantial. Could this have come out of a corporate division with a committee of corporate managers and some grunts to do the implementation?
* Perl. An earlier success in the same tradition.
* E, the capability-oriented language. Again, free.
* The last four languages I have downloaded and spent time with are all - Squeak, a version of Smalltalk, available on nearly every platform (generates bytecodes read by a VM, so writing the VM for a platform means Squeak runs on it). Associated with the Xerox PARC group which developed Smalltalk (including Alan Kay, Ted Kaehler, Dan Ingalls, etc.), then by Apple, then Disney, now scattered. Nominally open-source.
- OCaml, the object-oriented version of Caml, standing for "Categorically-abstract ML"). A variant of ML (Milner's "meta language"), coming mostly from France. (One of the CPunks list members who cracked a famous challenge, Damien D., was one of the principal developers. Julian Assange, also a list member at one time, was also - Haskell, the category theory-oriented pure functional language. Mostly associated with Yale University, Glasgow U., Oregon Graduate institute, Chalmers in Sweden, and many hundreds of academic - Self, the derivative of Smalltalk developed by several Stanford-affiliated people. Now mostly at Sun, with parts of the technology in Java Hotspot, and in the free language Squeak, a version of Smalltalk.
There are other examples. The obvious example is Unix, in its variants including Linux, despite the attempt by SCO to collect $1000 per CPU or whatever silly number they have floated in their lawsuits.
We free marketers, we believers in profits and property and contracts, we must acknowledge that most of the really good stuff in computer science, aside from the hardware, is often free. (Caveat: I use and enjoy immensely Mac OS X, which is not free. The software itself is very _close_ to being free, but the link to Mac hardware costs a bit more. Still, I enjoy it enough to pay for it. Nearly everything else I use on my Macs is free or very, very close to being free.)

All a contributor who wishes to be "credited" with having contributed has to do is "encode" his identity or that of his organization in the _amount_ of the contribution. This can be done out-of-band, even posted on a Website:
"Remember, gun owners! Show your support by contributing _exactly_ $91.37 to the candidates we recommend."
The pile of contributions of $91.37 would be just as sure (actually, only about 99% sure, for obvious statistical reasons) an indication of what the campaign donations were about as having a name attached.
(Sort of a higher-precision parallel to the practice of paying soldiers with $2 bills so that local merchants would really understand just how important the local military base was to their business.)
And if the system is unlinkable, then of course the contributions need not be N contributions from N different people. They could be N contributions of "91.37" from one contributor, a contributor who sends the politician an out-of-band (e-mail) message telling him exactly what to expect.
There are other ways to thwart this idea. And this use of digital cash got talked about a lot here several years ago. Having Big Brother run a "mix" where all such unlinkable contributions are pooled and then disbursed is an obvious fix (but then no need for digital cash...ordinary checks and money orders and cash accomplish the same thing, once Big Brother is the one holding and disbursing the cash).

Ironically, I was preparing myself for such an eventuality. I even Googled for reports on "jury "i.d."" and similar variants. I found no reports of legal hassles for people not having I.D. when called for for grand or petit jury duty, or for otherwise being ordered to enter a government building.
I was called for jury duty--admittedly a County of California building, not a Federal Protectorate building. But I had a hunch they might ask for "proof" that I was the person called, or not let me into the court room without I.D., etc.
I was mentally preparing to leave my D.L. and wallet back in my car (or even to take a bus for a few blocks, without license) and then tell the guarddroids: "No, I don't have a Driver's License...I'm not in my car right now, as you can see. My Driver's License is for when I'm My plan was not to file a Gilmore-type lawsuit, just respond to any demands for I.D. with a shrug. And then a departure, with the names of the guarddroids noted so I could later tell the authorities that I am not required to carry I.D. except when entering the U.S., driving a vehicle, and a few other similar things.
My younger brother, who has been on various juries, told me they never asked for any I.D.  (He's a registered Republican and has been called several times in his adult life. I'm a registered Libertarian and have not actually been called to serve since 1973, when I was still registered Republican. I smell something fishy.)
In any case, I was in the last "group" (31 of 31) which had to phone the courthouse to see if we were to be actually told to be present physically. The last couple of groups got excused. So my 30-year record of not serving on a jury has been upheld.
By the way, in case others didn't hear about this, smart card readers are apparently now considered "paraphernalia." Or at least grounds for expensive lawsuits (until those filing suit are countersued It seems a couple of subscribers to a satellite t.v. service (who shall remain nameless, as it is my provider and they probably Google for mentions of their name) bought a smart card reader/writer. Big Satellite Company sent them a lawsuit, claiming they were pirating Big Satellite Co's smartcards. All without any proof, at least none unveiled so far. The two guys said they are hobbyists and have "legitimate" reasons to buy openly available smart card reader/writers. (And they really don't have to say _what_ they are doing or planning to do with the card readers. Unless the gadgets are actually declared illegal, they are legal to own. And Big Sat Co has to have actual evidence, not mere suspicion. Of course, they are free to cancel the satellite service for these two guys.)

How would they even know one's views on this thing you're talking about?
(I'm not sure I know the name of this thing you're talking about, especially because I decided a long time ago not to carefully investigate this thing you're talking about, and especially not to carefully remember the name of this thing you're talking about, just so that I could honestly shrug and say "No, I don't know what that thing you're talking about is about.")
Also, my experience in 1973 with a jury trial (the last time I was registered Republican, the last time I served on a jury) was that the jurors were of course selected for a specific trial. I don't think your model works, where they quiz the prospective jurors and then shunt the un-PC off to traffic court. Basically, one doesn't have to answer _any_ questions until voir dire for the specific case has begun.
And then it's best to just play dumb about that thing you mentioned, or find a reason to mention that thing you talked about if one's intent is to be immediately drop-kicked out of the jury pool. (Which ends one's involvement...there is no "stick you on traffic accident cases" But that thing you mentioned is curious...I seem to have forgotten about it already.

The whole story, ranging from the depleted uranium to the reporters being "concerned" (that it got through), to the "this is very serious...we will look into filing smuggling charges" to the "we want the tapes" nonsense.
A bunch of points:
* depleted uranium (DU) is essentially pure U-238, with very low specific activity (decay rate); removal of the 2-3% of the higher specific activity U-235 lessens the overall decay rate of the original metal substantially.
* it is very easily shielded. True, the gammas are fairly penetrating, but can be shielded in various easy ways. (For example, sailboat keels are often made of lead...simply drill some holes in the keel, put the DU in the holes, cap the holes with lead. And sailboat keels are deep underwater, making even use of a gamma ray spectrometer a chore. For that matter, some high tech keels now use DU. DUh, so to speak.)
* the reaction of the reporters to what they did was "Look, we managed to get some dangerous uranium in through one of millions of shipping containers entering the U.S. at Long Beach!" No analysis.
* the reaction of the bureaucrats was unsurprising: declare that the crime is being looked into, round up all the parties for questioning, mutter darkly about how the U.S. Attorney may prosecute, natter about national security, flash some phony credentials, detain a few scientists, then move on to the next manufactured hype crisis.

I was curious about which messages in August could be of interest. Seeing none (via the lne.com feed I am subscribed to), I searched via Google for various articles mentioning "cypherpunks" and variations on "philadelphia," "pittsburgh," and "pennsylvania." And I narrowed the search to posts in July and August.
I got some almost immediate hits (no pun intended). I've made it easy for anyone to find them via Google. Search on this search string:
pittsburgh "professor rat"
Search also on some of the names in the first article which pops up, i.e., on:
"Mary Beth Buchanan"
My comment is that this "Professor Rat," whose posts I have not seen for as long as lne.com has been my feed, is probably in some real difficulty. His posts are very direct threats, not veiled in any of the vague, political "politicians ought to be given a fair trial and then hanged" or even the "I hope Washington is nuked" sorts.
(One rule of thumb I use is to never, ever use actual names of burrowcrats. Except for a few at the top, I don't even make any effort to remember the names. It's hard to be charged with making a direct, credible threat when no specific person is either named or alluded to.)
Were he in the U.S., I'd expect he'd face serious charges. Being that he's in Australia, as far as I know, I doubt extradition will occur. And even if he were prosecuted, by Oz or by the U.S., his various articles indicate "mental disturbance" could be a winning defense, with him ordered to get back on his Prozac or Zoloft or whatever.
The questions being asked of Jim may have to do with the Feds making the only prosecution they can make: that those passing on such threats via mailing lists are somehow guilty of some crime. This is just speculation on my part.
If so, the case may hinge on issues of "common carrier" status. Also, I believe Congress passed a bill explicitly saying that sysops are not liable for the e-mail passing through their systems...Declan will likely have the latest on this.
Anyway, I'll bet good money this is the series of messages in question. Nothing else I have seen either rises to this level or seems to involve Pennsylvania in any significant way.

Assuming this is not some silly joke comment,
First, the Feds have no significant "anti-spam enforcement" role. Anti-spam laws, such as they exist now, are not being criminally enforced, hence a DOJ role is unlikely.
Second, the Pennsylvania connection is unlikely for an anti-spam action, even if some poor soul in Penn. got spammed via a subscription list (meaning, likely no basis for complaint!).
Third, nothing in Choate's message mentioned spam or anything in detail. So why you would think the issue was related to "anti-spam enforcement" is a mystery to me.
Fourth, the search results I got were pretty convincing to me that a direct death threat was leveled against a government official, by name. The message even referred to waiting for her as she jogged by (or somesuch language, see the posting about Mary Beth Buchanan for details). The Feds take these kinds of posts a _lot_ more seriously than they do anti-spam measures, which likely don't even have the status of being actual criminal laws, at least not yet. And the recipients of a mailing list have no basis for claiming they were spammed through a list they voluntarily signed up for.

References:  <3FF184C2.9070002

I'm skeptical of this claim. A lot of Intel and AMD and similar machines are running full-tilt, "24/7." To wit, Beowulf-type clusters, the Macintosh G5 cluster that is now rated third fasted in the world, and so on. None of these machines is reported to be burning up literally. Likewise, a lot of home and corporate users are running background tasks which are at 100% CPU utilization.
(Examples abound, from render farms to financial modeling to... Friends of mine run a bunch of 2 and 3 GHz Pentium 4 machines in CPU-bound apps, and they run them 24/7. (Their company, Invest by Agents, analyzes tens of thousands of stocks. They use ordinary Dells and have had no catastrophic "burned literally" failures.)
Further, junction-to-case temperature in a ceramic package has a time constant of tens of seconds, meaning, the case temperature reaches something like 98% of its equilibrium value (as wattage reaches, say, 60 watts, or whatever), in tens of seconds. (For basic material and physics reasons...I used to make many of these measurements when I was at Intel, and nothing in the recent packaging has changed the physics of heat flow much.)
We also used to run CPUs at 125 C ambient, under operating conditions, for weeks at a time. Here the junction temperature was upwards of 185 C. Failures occurred in various ways, usually do to electromigration and things like that. Almost never was there any kind of "fire." Just "burnout," which is a generic name but has nothing of course to do with "burning" in the chemical sense.
Now I grant you that I haven't tested CPUs in this way in many years. But I am skeptical that recent CPUs are substantially different than past CPUs. I would like to see some actual reports of "burned literally" CPUs.
By the way, I have run some apps on my Macintosh 1 GHz CPU which are CPU-bound. No burn ups.
I'd like to see some support for the claim that running a stamp creation process is more likely to burn up a modern machine than all of these apps running financial modeling, render farms, and supercomputer clusters are doing.
Until then, render me skeptical.

Second, we are fast-moving toward a society and economy where only those who _wanted_ to study math and science by the time they were in high school will have anything more than a menial, makework job. Now whether they go the full course and get a college degree or advanced degree is not so much the point as it is that they were intrinsically So if a kid in high school can't see the "benefit" of studying math, he shouldn't be. It's as simple as that.
The parallel I like is one we developed (in Ted Kaehler's nanotechnology study group in the early 90s) for looking at what a society and economy might look like where the costs of material production are as close to zero as one might imagine. That is, a society with full-blown general assemblers, i.e., von Neumann replicators at the molecular, mechano-synthesis, Drexler-type scale. How would goods be produced and sold? How would markets exist/
The analogy I drew, in an essay, and that Howard Landman, Ted Kaehler, Mike Korns, and others added to was this:
* We already have an example of an entire town and an entire industry where essentially the costs of material production are nearly zero.
* Namely, Hollywood. Film stock is essentially free...bits even more so. Cameras remain expensive, but are vastly less so than they were a decade ago. Basically, everything material in Hollywood is nearly free. What is expensive is the creative talent, the know-how, the ensembles of actors and directors and writers and all.
(And writing is itself a perfect example of material abundance. All of the money is in the writing and distribution, virtually none of it in the materials, or in the low skill segment.)
Which is why some writers and some Hollywood types make tens of millions a year and most don't.
* The society we are heading towards is one of an increasingly sharp division between the "skilled and in demand" end of the spectrum and the bulk of droids who have few skills in demand.
(I argued this, circa 1991-2, to a bunch of people who basically bought the line that technology would bring wealth to the masses, blah blah. I argued that yes, the masses would have great material goods, just as the masses today have color tvs in their cribs. But the big money would elude them. Libertarian rhetoric about everybody being wealthy is only meaningful in the sense that even the poorest today are wealthy by Roman or Middle Ages or even Renaissance standards. But the split between those with talents in demand--the Peter Jacksons, the Stephen Kings, the Tim Berners-Lees, etc. and the "reading be for whitey" and "I don't see any benefit to studying math" vast bulk will widen.)
Much more could be said on this. I recall I wrote some long articles along these lines in the early years of the list.
In conclusion, your Bedford-Stuy student who doesn't see the point to studying math will never be a math researcher, or a physicist, or a chemist, or anything else of that sort. So no point in trying to convince him to study his math.
It's like convincing a kid to start writing so he'll stand a chance of being the next Stephen King: if he needs convincing, he won't be.

But what is your actual evidence, as opposed to your belief that overheating is a likely outcome? I have said that I know of many machines (tens of thousands of CPUs, and probably many more I don't know about directly) which are running CPU-bound applications 24/7. I have heard of no "burning up literally" cases with the many Beowulf clusters, supercomputers, and 24/7 home or business screensavers and crunching apps, so I suspect they are not common.
If you have actual evidence, as opposed to "likely outcome" speculations, please present the evidence.
This is true whether one is running Office or a stamp program. You are just repeating a general point about losing a fan, not about stamp generation per se. Boxer fan lifetimes are usually about comparable to hard drive lifetimes, which also kill a particular machine. You are not presenting anything new here, and the association with stamp generation is nonexistent.
Most clusters use exactly the same air-cooled machines as are available from Dell, Sun, Apple, etc. In fact, the blades and rackmount systems are precisely those available from Dell, Sun, Apple, etc.
You are presenting no evidence, just hypothesizing that your stamp protocol somehow burns out more CPUs than render farms do, than Mersenne prime apps to, than financial simulations do, etc. Yet you present no actual numbers.

The jabber about how poor people are actually paying for the successful is beyond belief. All sorts of arguments are being made about how poor people somehow pay for the infrastructure the wealthy exploit.
And the chestnut about how tax breaks aid the wealth disproportionately is once again brought out.
(Yeah, if Alice was paying $50K in taxes and the taxes are cut to $40K she "benefits more" than Bob the Wino who got no tax benefits because he paid no taxes. Which misses the point about Alice's high taxes in the first place.)
This is why the "Tax Freedom Day" approach is more useful. Tax freedom day is of course the day when the average American or Brit or whatever has stopped working for the government and has the rest of his income for himself. For most years, this is estimated to around May-June. That is, for almost half of a year a typical taxpayer is working for the Not a perfect measure, as it averages together folks of various tax brackets, including the many in America who pay nothing (but it doesn't assign a negative number to those who receive "net net" money from the government). And it fails to take into account the double taxation which a business owner faces: roughly a 50% tax on his profits, then when the profits are disbursed to the owners of the corporation, another 35-45% tax bite. For a business owner, he is effectively working for the government for the first 70% of every year. Which means only October-December is he working for his own interests.
Jabber about how poor people are actually receiving fewer tax benefits than rich people misses the point of who's working for whom.
Alice, an engineer or pharmacist or perhaps a small business owner, works between 40% and 70% of her time to pay money into government.
Bob, a crack addict collecting "disability" or welfare or other government freebies, works 0% of his time for the government/society. ("Dat not true. I gots to stands in line to get my check increased!")
Alice is a source, Bob is a sink. Talk about how Alice gets benefits ignores the fact that she's working for the government for a big chunk of her life. Bob is not. Alice is a slave for the government, and "society," so that Bob can lounge in his mobile home watching ESPN and collecting a monthly check.
(I'd like to know why all of the folks here in California who are getting "benefits" and "services" are not at my door on Saturday morning to help me with my yard work. I'd like to know why finding reliable yard workers has become nearly impossible in the past couple of decades. "Will work for food" signs are a fucking joke...try hiring one of those layabouts to actually do some work for food and watch the sneers, or watch them threatening to fake a work injury if a shakedown fee is not given to them. These people should be put in lime pits.)
When you hear John Young and Tyler Durden nattering about the "persons of privilege" are reaping the rewards of a benificent government, think about Alice and Bob and ask yourself who'se doing the real work. Ask who're the sources and who're the sinks.

(actually, looking over your sociology, I see it's just more of the liberal whine and sleaze, so I won't bother commenting on it again)
The last refuge of the scoundrel is to dismiss stuff as "secondary and tertiary sources," sort of like the fakers I used to meet in college who nattered on about having learned their physics from Newton's "Principia" instead of from secondary and tertiary sources.
I encountered von Neumann's work on self-replicating machines when I was in high school (*). It came up in connection with the Fermi paradox and in issues of life (this was before the term "artificial life" was au courant...I was at the first A-LIFE Conference in '87...von Neumann couldn't make it).
(* And no, I don't know mean my high school teachers taught us about von Neumann machines. 97% of the science I knew by the time I graduated from high school I'd learned on my own, from the usual "secondary and tertiary sources.")
A few moments of thought will show the connection between replicators and general assemblers. A general assembler can make another general assembler, hence all general assemblers are replicators.  And in fact this is necessary to make mechanosynthesis nanotech viable, as otherwise it takes all the multibillion dollar wafer fabs in the world, if they could make nanoscale things, to make some scum on the bottom of a test tube. GAs only start to become possible after the replication problem has been solved (which it has not, despite claims about self-reproducing software structures and train sets and the like).

No, as there is no "fund" that this money is in. Once taxes are paid in, the money has gone out to crack addicts, Halliburton, welfare whores (excuse me, "hoes"), foreign dictators like Mubarek and Sharon, and so on.
In fact, the estimated overall debt is something like $30-40 trillion. I've outlined how this number is arrived at a few times in the past. As there are about 100 million tax filers in the U.S.--the other 175 million being children, spouses, prisoners, welfare recipients, illegal aliens, non-filers, etc.--a simple calculation shows the average indebtedness per tax filer is around $300,000 or more. This is far, far beyond what the average household owns in total. Because the U.S. has been "charging it" for the past 40 years. Quibblers will say we can reduce this indebtedness by selling off government-owned lands, which would be a good start. Or be taxing corporations more, but this still ends up with the individual tax filers, ultimately. Or by devaluing the dollar dramatically, which is the likeliest strategy the kleptocrats will follow, after gettting enough advance warning to get their own assets out of dollar-denominated vehicles.
So, you see, there IS NO FUND one can withdraw money from.
Anyone claiming new welfare benefits requires even more thefts from those still working.

I admire many negroes. Shelby Steele, who wrote "The Content of our Character," for example. And Thomas Sowell, an even more prolific author (and Stanford professor). And Niger Innes (son of the lefty Roy Innes...a lot of children of 60s liberal negroes are now libertarian or conservative, e.g., Adam Clayton Powell's son). And Clarence Thomas (who has argued forcefully that the Supremes ought to do a very thorough review of gun laws, with the hint that the right decision would be to restore the Second Amendment to first class status). And a bunch of others, including Ward Connerly, of California, who has been leading the effort to have "race" removed as the basis for _any_ government actions, including hiring quotas, special admissions requirements for negroes and Asians (at opposite ends of the test score spectrum), and so on.
I don't admire the politics of Condie Rice and Colin Powell, but there is little doubt that they are accomplished, bright people.
My problem is that negroes are 80% in solidarity on a bunch of disgusting, anti-liberty things: affirmative action, racial quotas, minority setasides (but not for successful minorities--they want limits on the number of Asians admitted to UC schools), welfare, increased benefits, etc.
Further, they, as a whole, have a "plantation mentality": always demanding that Massa in the Big White House give them more stuff. Instead of excelling and grabbing the stuff for themselves, as Chinese and Korean and Indian people have done in America, they think setasides and quotas and special favoritism is "owed" to them.
I used to not care much about what they did or thought. When I entered college in 1970 I expected to mix with a bunch of different sorts of people. What I found was that the negroes all sat at the same tables in the dining halls, that whites who sat near them were chased off, and that we non-blacks, including Asians, Indians, South Americans, whites, etc., could mix with each other, but not with the "Panthers."
And they ghettoized themselves into "Black Studies," which they had "demanded" a couple of years earlier and had just gotten in 1969.
In 1972 they formed various militant groups on campus. One obnoxious woman named Judy became the student association president. When she didn't like a decision, she ordered the Panthers, her enforcers, to bar the doors and not let anyone out until the decision was reversed. It I am not exaggerating. I included this, and the theft of ASU funds, and the henchmen, and similar leftist actions by others (including the MeCHA "Aztlanos"), in a letter to the Regents of the University of California. It was published in the school newspaper, in a full-paged spread, and I got replies from the governor of the state, Ronald Reagan. I met with the Chancellor and he agreed that the situation at the campus was deplorable, but that in the interests of keeping the peace with the negroes and Mexicans, given the time (1973), there was little they could do. He promised that his office was looking into the allegations and already knew about most of them.
When I joined Intel in 1974, I saw plenty of Chinese, Indians, a handful of Koreans and Vietnamese (more later), but only one negro engineer. And he had a major chip on his shoulder. When he was let go in one of the RIFs, he claimed discrimination on the basis of his melanin levels.
Meanwhile, the excuses mounted all around about how "science is sexist and gynophobic," about how the ancient Egyptians were actually black Africans and had their advanced civilization (electricity, flying cars, etc.) stolen by the "ice people" and similar such malarkey. The Reverend Jesse Jackson, a racist hustler, tried to shake down Silicon Valley corporations for payoffs to his Rainbow scam. (Meanwhile, negroes avoided science, math, engineering, technology and preferred to focus their efforts on lawsuits to get standards lowered, via "race norming." The bullshit went on and on.)
I look at the 75% bastard rate (compared to about 25% for whites and about 5% for Asians in America), the black on white crime, the black on black crime, the crack hoes, the disrespect for learning....all this and I can draw only one conclusion" that though there are many fine, competent, bright negroes, on the whole it is a gutter race.
Harsh phrase, but true. A race that, in America in the last 40 years, has become a race of beggars, whiners, wheedlers, chiselers, whores, crack addicts, dropouts, and unwed mothers.
Charles Murray laid out a lot of the reasons in his book "Losing Ground." ("Dat be a racist book!," said his detractors.)
The seminal event was the arrival on the scene of the collectivist JFK. Kennedy ordered his bunch of eastern elitists to look into the "relief" system which had provided very limited and very temporary economic assistance to folks in bad situations. For those few here old enough (I am, just barely), this used to be called "general relief," and it was mostly administered at the county level, in the states that offered it. What Kennedy's brain trust found was that "relief" was seen as an embarrassment, as a negative thing, something to avoid getting on if at all possible and to get off of just as fast as one could. Which is as it should be, of course.
So Kennedy's liberals scratched their heads and came up with a new plan. "Relief" would be converted to a series of state and national programs, no longer handled locally. And the bad connotations of "relief" would be changed by the new and positive name "entitlement."
Money handed out to various folks would be their "entitlement," something they were _owed_. Other related names would be "social services" and, of course, liberal mention of "children" and "nutrition." Ergo programs like WIC ("Women, Infants, and Children"). Ergo, "Head Start." Oh, and meddling in foreign countries with things like the Peace Corps (which, the feministas are slowly coming to realize, did much to break "primitives" of things like breast-feeding, while giving the baby formula industry a new world market).
Kennedy got zapped for his many crimes, but the Good Ole Boy who took over turned out to be just as big a collectivist as Kennedy had been, and LBJ continued the Kennedy welfare/entitlements/handouts and called it "The Great Society." (I don't recall if Kennedy had formally named his progressive plan.)
And that year was the year that negroes got to vote in all 50 states, which of course was a good thing. The part of the Civil Rights Act that dealt with voting rights was good. The Constitution applies to all However, most of the Civil Rights Act was terrible, for obvious reasons. Between it and new interpretations of the 14th Amendment (lawyers can quote the language), and some terrible Warren Court decisions (*), the effect was to interfere in the ability of people to choose who to do business with, who to rent to, who to associate with, all of the things which liberty means.
(* The Supreme Court took a case where a negro had been denied service at a diner in the south and used a weird series of logical steps to argue that if negroes couldn't buy food at this diner then napkin and ketchup and hot dog sales might be affected, and since some of that stuff came from other states, that would be interfering in interstate trade and only Congress can regulate that, blah blah, and so racial discrimination was outlawed under the fucking Commerce Clause of the Constitution! Of course, by the same logic, if Apple decides to change suppliers of disk drives, and this means Illinois gets the business instead of Idaho, this has also changed interstate trade. But logic was not the point of what the Court was doing...they were looking for any excuse to stop "discrimination.")
OK, what of discrimination itself? Good or bad?
Most of us probably agree that telling a black person he cannot shop in some bookstore, told by the bookstore owner that is, is not cool, to use a technical phrase. We might call it tacky, or unethical, or just plain dumb. (And if the government tried to say blacks could not enter a bookstore, this would be both interfering with the property rights of the bookstore owner AND violating the colorblind standards of the But libertarians argue--and this was the natural system for 170 years--that what a property owner does with his property is, assuming he is not violating real rights (*) of others, up to him to decide, whether his decisions are uncool, stupid, unwise, etc.
(* I mean real rights, as in property, personal safety, economic ownership, etc., not some "right to enter the stores I wish to enter." No more so than anyone has a "right" to be invited into someone's house, or into a club, etc.)
So, during just a couple of years of the Great Society, this confluence of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the new interpretations of the 14th Amendment, and Supreme Court decisions, the ability of people and corporations to choose whom they wished to deal with, or hire, or fire, ended. "Racial discrimination" became the new word to demonize anyone or any group. When civil libertarians like Barry Goldwater said this restriction on liberty was a bad direction to move in, he was dubbed a I could write much more on this whole sorry episode. It's a sorry episode not because I have any desire to exclude negroes or women or cripples or queers or any other of the "protected groups" (added over the years), but because it erases the concept of liberty. If I can't rent to whom I choose, I have no control over my own belongings.
If I can be told I must hire a certain percentage of negroes (later dubbed "tokens'), this not only interferes with freedom of association (which applies to groups and corporations, obviously) but it also has a corrosive effect on those hired and how those around them think about them. ("Token blacks" in departments of companies are often thought of as having been hired to get the EEOC stooges off the company's back.)
I have the fundamental right, via ownership of my property and my freedom of association, to hire or fire based on merit, based on whim, based on astrology, whatever. It may not be wise, but it's my choice.
I have the fundamental right to have only Muslims in my company, or only Jews working in my bookstore, or to have only buxom women working at my strip club. (Recall the "discrimination" suits filed over such policies, including males claiming they were discriminated against, women in wheelchairs or with mastectomies claiming they have a "right" to be hired by a strip club that doesn't want them, and so on.)
The can of worms that was opened when liberty was cancelled is still with us, getting worse and worse. Feminista attorney sued a California gym for excluding women, and the courts ordered gyms to admit women....ah, but the same order did not ban women only gyms, and these are now common in California.
A church which refused to hire a Satanist was ordered to do so. (This was later rescinded...apparently even the courts can't deal with the Alice in Wonderland-like situation where discrimination is banned.)
This is what Shelby Steele, the black I referred to earlier, is saying in "The Content of our Character," that blacks should be judged on the content of their character, not the color of their skin. (He is quoting Martin Luther King, of course.) This does NOT mean that this maxim gets enforced by the government, and that discriminating on the basis of color should be illegal. He, and King (some think), is arguing that this is the "right" thing to do, but is not something government should be enforcing.
Note of course that most businessmen will not turn away customers. Things in the deep south were skewed by the War of Northern Aggression, and it took time for sentiments to change. But in many cases the apartheid in the south was managed and enforced by local _governments_, with the public restrooms being "White" and "Colored."
(As in South Africa, where companies like IBM wanted to hire blacks but were ordered not to by the RSA government.)
Anyway, I resent deeply being told I may not associate as I wish, may not rent or sell my property as I wish, must meet certain hiring quotas or face EEOC fines, must promote based on race not character or skills, and so on. I resent deeply the whole can of worms that involves "discrimination against gays" and "handicapped-friendly" policies, and the whole enforced "niceness" bullshit (which is not actually making people nicer...just the opposite, as when I had to deal with a token we had in our department and was ordered to not do anything that might cause him to file a discrimination lawsuit against us).
I see the success the Chinese and Indians and other Asians have had in America...none of it do to quotas, to forced hiring, to the nonsense the negroes keep pulling.
(I haven't talked much about Mexicans, by the way. Many Mexicans are perfectly fine...hard-working, friendly, etc. Often they are not very academically-oriented, so few are in engineering positions. And many are as bad as many of the negroes. Worse, the issue of "illegal aliens." As Tom McClintock pointed out so cogently in his debate with Schwarzenegger, et. al., the real issue is that these illegal aliens (perhaps as many as 10 million now) are CUTTING IN LINE, cutting in line ahead of those waiting patiently and legally to enter the U.S. from Russia, Romania, India, Thailand, etc.  And we gave the Mexican and Latin American illegals an "amnesty" in the mid-90s: Simpson-Mozzoli, a promised one time only deal. Ah, but the cynics, including me, were right: more aliens swarmed in, looking for another amnesty. As a pure libertarian I would have no problem with truly open borders, provided there were absolutely no taxpayer-funded programs or services, and provided the piles of rotting corpses were not used as an excuse to give "services." But open immigration is not going to happen. Meanwhile, giving these illegal aliens permanent residency status would be a fucking disaster. As with the Simpson-Mazzoli illegals, once amnestied they have a strong tendency to sign up for all of the "entitlements" JFK and LBH and RMN established. Which is why my local town has a hospital that is facing insolvency, as the swarms of Mexicans use the services mandated by law and collection is nearly impossible. And the State of California is facing insolvency, as you all know. Enough about Mexicans.)
So, to wrap this up, I see plenty of brown-skinned people from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc. doing very well without chanting about "racist discrimination" and demanding that some version of "Ebonics" be used to teach their children (just the opposite, they really WANT their children to be fluent and precise in standard English). And I see Chinese, Korean, and other Asian immigrants doing well, not bellyaching that the reason they're failing is because The Man is holding them down, that Massah has passing out enough freebies.
And the black libertarians and conservatives I cited earlier share this view. They don't put it quite as bluntly as I do, that the negro in America is becoming a gutter race, but they obviously think the trends of the past 40 years are disturbing and not good for the bulk of their fellow negroes.

And I should have elaborated on the family system effects of the new welfare system:  since the "entitlements" were not given to families with husbands in the household, this made marriage a bad idea for those wanting to get welfare.
A young girl could go from the bottom of the pecking order in her household to the top in her own apartment, with an income from welfare that increased with each baby she had. So we had the spectacle of 14-year-old girls being given their own apartments by Big Brother, paid for with taxes taken from working suckers.
The effects of this are so corrosive as to practically be unexplainable to normal people: households solely dependent on handouts from government, fathers completely absent (except in sneak visits), a disrespect for those who work, the boys in the household anxious to hang out on the streets below rather than be with Momma, the crime that comes from this kind of hanging out, self-loathing (it seems likely) that leads to lashing out at "whitey," and a perpetuating cycle as the young girls seek to get their own "cribs" so the process can repeat and This is why so many black families today are into their third or even fourth generation of welfare life.
By the way, part of the reason Kennedy wanted to "remove the stigma of relief" was because the decade of the 1950s had been especially bad for the urban poor. Many blacks had moved from farms in the south to cities like Washington, New York, Cincinnati, Oakland, Chicago, etc. Partly they had moved to work in factories during the war, partly because automation on the farms had displaced manual laborers, partly because they heard of the success of other blacks who had moved north.
But they were moving into the cities just as the whites were leaving. (And the whites were not leaving because the blacks were coming in...rather, the new jobs were increasingly in the suburbs, and as highways and freeways and ring roads were built around cities, and as cars became plentiful, and as families grew, many of the city-born whites were moving into the massive new subdivisions being built out in the suburbs.)
So the blacks got to the inner cities with mostly only manual labor skills, just as such jobs were vanishing under automation and through a shift to the suburbs.
Now what government _should have done_ circa the early 1960s is this: Nothing. Except to cut taxes to encourage even more business, and to maybe point out to blacks that they should slow down their move to the cities. (By the way, the same move to the cities was happening in other countries, which is why Mexico City now has something like 20 million residents, most of them very poor.)
But instead of letting the dice fall where they may, letting the bad effects discourage other blacks from moving to the cities, Kennedy set his advisors to the problem of solving "urban poverty." They expanded welfare and entitlements, ostensibly because America "could afford it" (the 1950s having been a prosperous period).
Precisely the wrong thing to do. It encouraged even more blacks to flock to the cities, and once started, once established, the welfare spigot could not be turned off, could not be denied to the newcomers. And none of the planners, I expect, saw the effects of the law of unintended consequences, that they would disincentive blacks from seeking hard jobs, that multigenerational welfare would become the norm, and that blacks would be seen by those doing so well in the rapidly-expanding, prosperous suburbs as some kind of throwback to plantation life. The various "demands" by black leaders, the reverse racism ("honkie mofo"), the whole hatred for learning ("reading be for whitey") all combined with the welfare state in these cities to create this gutterization of the negro.
Even when the full magnitude of this developing train wreck was obvious even to the liberals, they didn't pull back from the brink and say "Let's stop this train wreck." Nope, they said the problem was "not enough money." So benefits were expanded in the 1970s, with more Medicare, Medical, larger payments...the idea was to pay enough to get people "back on their feet." But of course, human nature being what it is, most took the higher payments and bought nicer stuff, hence the color televisions found in every "crib."
And the huge influxes of Mexicans during the 70s and 80s magnified the problem (to turn down Mexicans for the same "entitlements" that blacks were getting would not have been kosher, would it?). The effect was that large chunks of cities now had urbanized Mexican ghettoes, paid for with dollars coming from the taxed suckers out in the suburbs.
Whoops. Another train wreck.
And it continues. Finally, even Bill Clinton, a Democrat, tried to put the brakes on welfare. It's worked in some ways, but not in other ways. Just too many "entitlements" to stop the hemorrhaging of money.
(To those who claim the biggest recipients of "welfare" are corporations, review again what I wrote about "sources and sinks." And look at the $40 billion hole California is in. It isn't because of any "welfare to corporations." The "services" sector is a black hole sucking in nearly all of the tax monies collected in California.)
The problem is that some well-meaning social planners thought they could fix a fundamental problem (poor people moving into cities) by giving money to the poor people in cities. It not only didn't work, it worsened the problem in multiple ways and largely caused the "racial" divisions of today.

Someday you may learn that content matters more than your "listen up,  boys and girls" and "milk ran out my nose" sort of patter. Then you may  find actual economic success, no longer dependent on your wife to  support you.
Consider that CPUs have gotten 10 times faster than when you started  yammering about "digital bearer instruments" and general programming  tools have gotten at least a couple of times better. If you can't  implement what you have been yammering about with this amount of CPU  power and tools, but instead think you need to raise $$$$ to hire a few  programmers and have a company, you are clearly smoking herb.
Haskell running on 4 GHz of processor(s) gives you vastly more power  than any 10 programmers had several years ago.

I came up with a plan which is workable immediately and which does not require substantive changes:
Put a partition down the middle of a school building. One side is "Blue," the other side is "Red."
Blue and Red have different academic orientations, different goals. What the goals are and how they are set might arise in different ways, e.g., by a vote of parents, or the backgrounds of the teachers in each, and so on. Not so important. What is important is what follows.
As the Blue and Red sides evolve, with perhaps one focusing on academic excellence and the other on "social skills," parents could move their children between the sides (say, on a semester by semester basis, to reduce thrashing). As the sizes of the Blue and Red sizes change, the partition would be moved.
This gives "policy choice" within a particular school building, which is a lot less expensive than busing students long distances to get to "magnet" schools (science, performing arts, crack dealing, etc.).

I assume they figured that since they were using PGP to communicate with their fellow anti-capitalists, that crypto must be cool (I'm not sure if they favor the negro term, "bad," or the traditional term, "good," so I'll use the term of my generation, "cool.")

That's what sniper rifles with low light scopes are for: kill one or  both or all of the cops who arrested you in this way. Cops who abuse  the criminal system and violate constitutional rights blatantly have  earned killing.
(A Remington 700 or Winchester 70 in .308 or .300 Savage, with  something like a Leupold or Swarovski 7 x 40 scope, is very good for  this kind of work. Safe shots from 200 meters away. (Yes, much longer  shots are possible, but may miss. Do some practice at the range at 200  m to see what I mean.) The Beltway sniper took his shots at this range  or closer.)

And vast amounts of misinformation are constantly being spread by the popular press, and in popular television shows, and in movies. One of the most popular t.v. shows, the oxymoronically named "Law and Order," almost weekly shows someone being told that if he doesn't help the police his restaurant will be shut down for a week while city health inspectors use a microscope on it. Another meme that is false is spread by "NYPD Blue," "Law and Order," and the Fox show that used to be on: "Cops" (not sure if it still is). Namely, that Fifth Amendment rights against compelled self-incrimination only apply after an actual arrest ("You haven't been arrested yet, so let's not hear about how you can remain silent."), or after an attorney has arrived ("He lawyered up.")
The right not to be compelled to provide potentially incriminating evidence is a broad one, deeply enmeshed in our Bill of Rights. Even someone suspected of a crime, even a very serious crime, is under no compulsion to "talk to the police," whether or not he has a lawyer There are regrettable exceptions, such as in our "pre-constitutional" (my view of it) grand jury system, where people can be told to tell all they know. Sometimes they get various types of immunity, often the claim is that their grand jury testimony will not be used to convict them (if they not ostensibly the principals in the crime!), and so on. But the fact is that grand jury testimony is often compelled (And one of the ways the Feds have been getting people they can't get in other, more direct, ways is to interview parties in a case and then find some subtle contradiction. Then the charge is "lying to a federal employee" (or somesuch...maybe the language is "lying in an official investigation," to distinguish it from lying to your neighbor the GS-12 midlevel employee at NASA).
What I've done in several cases where I was stopped by cops is to SAY NOTHING. In the Stanford case, I told them I would not be giving them either my name or telling them what my business was that day at Stanford: it was not their business and I saw no reason to satisfy their  curiosity.  In a couple of cases in Santa Cruz, cops have asked me my name and asked why i was in a particular area. I told them I would be answering no questions.
In none of these cases was I arrested, booked, or charged.
I would, and have, answer questions if I knew there was no conceivable way I could become a "person of interest" in a case. I have answered police questions in some crimes I have had knowledge of (and wished to see the guilty parties dealt with...I would not lightly aid in a drug case, though.
And if one is committing no crime, answering a nosy cop's questions is neither required by my reading of the Constitution nor is healthy. (In the Stanford case, had I given them my name and/or ID, my name would have appeared in a report about "threats to the President, and our resolution of the case"--the SS version of quotas for traffic tickets.
(When one cop blurted out to me that he had seen me planting a bomb near the route Clinton would pass by, I _was_ tempted to say "I demand a lawyer!," just so they'd arrest me, etc. But I didn't, which is probably good, as I might have spent a few nights in jail...and felt the requirement to stalk the arresting officers and use a sniper rifle on one or more of them.)
We are certainly entering a police state era. Interesting that so many Jews are so strongly behind the fascist measures...Jews like Swinestein, Boxer, Lieberman, and hundreds of others. But, as in the ZOG state, the true heirs of the Third Reich are today's Jews...it would make a good "Outer Limits" episode, except the modern OL was thoroughly leftist, anti-gun, pro-ZOG, and had several episodes involving SS camp guards reincarnated as camp residents, and variations. So having the SS reincarnated in the ZOG state would not have fit their Zionist biases.

This has come up various times on the Net. I'm not a lawyer, but I take "arrest" to mean "not free to move on." As in a state of arrest (cognate to rest), arrested motion, arrested development. Hence the common question: "Am I under arrest?," with the follow-up: "If not, then I'll be on my way."
Arrest is not the same thing as being booked, of course. Many who are arrested are never booked. Arrest, to this nonlawyer, is when a cop tells me I am not free to move as I wish, that he will handcuff me or worse if I try to move away from him.
I expect our millions of lawyers and hundreds of billions of court hours have produced a range of definitions, from "the cop wants to know why you're reading a particular magazine, and will cuff you if you give him any lip" to "all black men within a 5 block radius are being detained for questioning, but are not under formal arrest" to "you're under arrest, put your hands behind your back" to shooting first and Mirandizing the corpse.
I am under arrest if I am in an arrested state of movement, that is, not free to move as I wish.
Again, people need to read up on the Lawson case. And absent an internal travel passport, there is no requirement to carry ID. That some states haven't heard about the Lawson case, or the Fourth Amendment, is no excuse.
As I said, there is no requirement to carry ID except when doing certain things (like driving). Whether some or most states will issue licenses to those who don't or can't drive is irrelevant: they are not REQUIRED to be carried, so not having one cannot possibly be a crime.
I provided "Lawson" and "San Diego." Plenty of stuff to find hundreds of discussions. I favor giving unique information sufficient in a Google search, not providing pre-digested search URLs.

The First Amendment is quite clear about prior restraint and censorship. Not only is it legal for "The Progressive" to publish details of how to make a hydrogen bomb, and for the "New York Times" to publish the Pentagon Papers, but it is legal to publish SS numbers when they become available.
Now civil actions are another can of worms, and Bill Gates, for example, may sue somebody for publishing his SS number. Or I may sue the U.S. Marshal's Service for illegally using my SS number as a legal ID (which my SS card, still in my possession from when I got it in 1969) says is to be used for tax and Social Security purposes ONLY and MAY NOT be used for identifcation) and letting it circulate over the But such civil suits--by Gates, by cops, by me--are NOT the same as prior restraint on publishing words.

4. Do not interfere with, or obstruct the police -- you can be arrested for it.
IF YOU ARE STOPPED FOR QUESTIONING
1. It's not a crime to refuse to answer questions, but refusing to answer can make the police suspicious about you. You can't be arrested merely for refusing to identify yourself on the street.

By the way, something else from that ACLU site I cited (and sighted):
--begin excerpt--
IN YOUR HOME
1. If the police knock and ask to enter your home, you don't have to admit them unless they have a warrant signed by a judge.
2. However, in some emergency situations (like when a person is screaming for help inside, or when the police are chasing someone) officers are allowed to enter and search your home without a warrant.
3. If you are arrested, the police can search you and the area close by. If you are in a building, "close by" usually means just the room you are in.
--end excerpt--
This is why one should _never_ invite cops into a house, even for a chat. They may use nearly any grounds to make an "arrest" (again, arrest does not necessarily mean a booking, or a formal charging, just an arrest of one's freedom to move about or leave). Once an arrest has been made, they may then search the premises (as above) based on this And anything they see in other areas "in plain sight," such as bottles of pills or a rifle case, etc., may be used to expand the search.
I've also heard it reported that it is _easier_ for cops to arrest a person if he steps _outside_ his house. Not sure why, but it may have to do with some reptilian brain memory of "a man's home is  his castle" or even to court precedent related to the above example. In other words, arresting a person in his home opens the home up to warrantless searches "so avoid this if possible."
It seems to me the ideal balance is then this:

In its purest form, I think not.
If Alice is told that she must place some device in something she owns, which was the example with Carnivore, then the Third applies (she has been told to "quarter troops," abstractly, in her home).
If, however, Bob is told that in order to build television sets or VCRs he must include various noise suppression devices, as he must, or closed-captioning features, as he must, or the V-chip (as I believe he must, though I never hear of it being talked about, as we all figured would be the case), or the Macrovision devices (as may  be the case), then this is a matter of regulation of those devices. Whether Alice then _chooses_ to buy such devices with "troops already living in them," abstractly speaking, is her choice.
Now the manufacturer may have a claim, but government regulation of manufacturers has been going on for a very long time, and unless a manufacturer can claim that the devices must be in his own home or operated in his premises, he cannot make a very strong case that _he_ is the one being affected by the quartering.
The pure form of the Third (in this abstract sense) is when government knocks on one's door and says "Here is something you must put inside your house."
By the way, there have been a bunch of cases where residents of a neighborhood were ordered to leave so that SWAT teams could be in their houses to monitor a nearby house where a hostage situation had developed. (It is possible that in each house they occupied they received uncoerced permission to occupy the houses, but I don't think this was always the case; however, I can't cite a concrete case of this. Maybe Lexis has one.)
If this takeover of houses to launch a raid is not a "black letter law" case of the government quartering troops in residences, nothing is. Exigent circumstance, perhaps, but so was King George's need to quarter his troops.

The wholesale opening of the door to those who "cut in line" (ahead of those from England, Denmark, Romania, India, etc. who waited patiently in line by submitting their immigration requests) is deplorable.
Either open the borders or not, but surely don't reward those who cut in line.
Oh, and the march of 2.5 million Mexicans and Latins from the south is already underway...they got the message the last time when the Simpson-Mazzoli "one time amnesty, just this one time!" happened, and millions more arrived. Now that the new Mexican immigration is happening, several million more will arrive.
By the way, there is no acceptable hospital in the region near me because "legal but won't pay their bills" Mexicans have utterly swamped the W*ts*nv*ll* Community Hospital. It is unable to collect from those who show up at its emergency room (and must be treated, by law) that it is now running short on so many things that it is not safe to use. (They'll probably threaten to sue me, so I'll disguise the above name.)
I'd favor letting all in who want to get in, provided nobody demands that I pay for any services for them. Any services, not just "few" services. There are a couple of billion in the world who would gladly come to America if the borders were open...I'm not exaggerating at all. Between 1 and 2 billion, at least.
Let them come. But let them starve when 950 million of them find no work and a limit to charity by the do-gooder minority. Let piles of their corpses fertilize our crops...it's why God made bulldozers.
