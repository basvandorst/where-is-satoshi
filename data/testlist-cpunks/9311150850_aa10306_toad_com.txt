@_subject: Great quote from public NIST comments on Clipper 
EFF has made available the full file of public comments that were
submitted to NIST through the "cryptnow at eff.org" service.  I found this
great quote in there:
  However, if this standard is adopted, we at least have the opportunity to
  reduce our dependence on imported oil substantially. All we need do is
  hook up generators to the bones of the authors of the Constitution and
  the Bill of Rights. I estimate their rotational speed at 2000 RPM now and
  rising rapidly.
  Sincerely yours,

  Agency tendency to advance exaggerated claims of authority ... stems from
  conscious policy or the actions of individual NSA employees.''
