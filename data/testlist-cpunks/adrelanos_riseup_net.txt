@_subject: [tor-talk] almost success  toward complete tor enforcement, 
That's a bit insufficient and some points clearly outdated, see below.
You don't need pdnsd,ttdnsd,polipo. Vidalia is a nice optional graphical
user interface.
Someone else has to answer here.
You're on the wrong path. Don't use polipo / Firefox etc. anymore,
unless you want to stay out from all other Tor users. Use Tor Browser.
You don't need iptables for that. Tor is running on a Gateway. Tor
Browser without Tor/Vidalia started (patched startup script) is running
on another machine. (Which we call Workstation.)
Tor Button SOCKS Host: gateway IP, port: reserve one SocksPort in torrc
on Gateway exclusively for Tor Browser. Add some extra SocksPorts for
other applications. (stream isolation)
You don't need ttdnsd. I recommend using one SocksPorts per most, if not
all applications. If you still want some remaining traffic fallback you
can use Tor's excellent Dns- and TransPorts.
For a "fetch remaining DNS traffic and route through Tor iptables rule"
have a look at
and search for "dns".
You probable mess up there figuring out what is lan traffic for real and
what not. I strongly recommend the Tor-only box to have no local lan
Like said before, forget about that plan. Don't use polipo.
You can do it with virtual machines and/or physical isolation.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and P2P 
I tend to agree but I am not sure. At the moment I don't believe the Tor
project will die soon. It's fine with me if we can continue use it for
anonymous browsing, circumvention and so on for the next years.
It's also questionable if the Tor project should try to get a big share
of the people interested in anonymous p2p. I tend to think no, because
this opens up the project for a lot negative press. That increases the
risk for a new law to forbid the whole network in even more countries.
Let other networks try that out.
Loads of links here:
A very interesting idea is/was the owner free filesystem:
Depending on ones individual threat model, I believe i2p could be
sufficiently secure for file sharing purposes:
I didn't make an academic comparison, but it looks like retroshare is
quickly gaining more and more users:

@_subject: [liberationtech] Whonix Anonymous Operating System Version 7 Released! 
Hash: SHA512
Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and
security. It's based on the Tor anonymity network, Debian GNU/Linux
and the principle of security by isolation. DNS leaks are impossible,
and not even malware with root privileges can find out the user's real IP.
Whonix consists of two parts: One solely runs Tor and acts as a
gateway, which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other, which we call
Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only
connections through Tor are possible.
Download: Users of Whonix 0.5.6 and below:
There is no upgrade path from Whonix 0.5.6 to Whonix 7. You have to
manually download new Whonix images.
Call for Help:
If you know shell scripting (/bin/bash) and linux sysadmin, please
join us! There are plenty of ways to make Whonix safer. We are also
looking for an https direct download mirror.
Whonix 7 Changelog:
* Updated Tor to 0.2.4.
* Installed obfs3 by default. (for obfsproxy bridges)
* New Identity button on Tor Browser is now functional thanks to the
Control Port Filter Proxy (
* Tor Browser is now the system default browser ( In addition,
when opening a link or an html file it will ask for confirmation to
avoid accidental linking. (configurable)
* Graphical Whonix-Gateway ( Optionally, if you reduce
Whonix-Gateway RAM to below 500 MB, let's say to 128 MB, you
automagically end up with the usual non-graphical Whonix-Gateway.
* Whonix now includes an updater. It can not be promised that you will
never have to download a new image for next stable releases, but we
are on that way. Interested testers may have to download images of
testing releases from time to time.
* Tor networking is disabled for the first start of Whonix-Gateway.
The connection wizard (whonixsetup) will automatically start to help
enabling Tor or setting up bridges. This is useful for people using
bridges to connect to the Tor network to hide the fact that they are
using Tor.
* The current Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) Alpha, which will soon become
the new TBB stable, will work out of the box in Whonix, even if you
download and install it manually from torproject.org. This is useful
for the case that the Whonix Tor Browser updater breaks due to changes
on torproject.org. Tor over Tor situation will be automatically
prevented on manual installs.
* Boot Clock Randomization.
* Time Sanity Check.
* Higher console resolution: 1024x768 (without X).
* Disabled the throw-keyids option on gpg.conf due to usability
issues. Enable it manually if you need it.
* Fixed uwt. To do certain tasks such as installing the Adobe Flash
plugin or running update-command-not-found you no longer need to
"chmod -x /usr/local/bin/curl".
* Deactivated the kgpg tray icon by default ( not perfect, but
less confusing, since it will now start in foreground by default and
no longer as tray icon (which was automatically and confusingly hidden
by default).
* Downloading Tor Browser and signature from idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion
instead of torproject.org for better security when run inside Whonix.
* Time Privacy wrapper (optional).
* Enable "apparmor=1 security=apparmor" by default (didn't enable
enforce mode or add any useful profiles yet).
* Manpages for scripts which come with Whonix.
* Flexible modular .d style configuration folders: /etc/whonix.d/,
* Moved blog to wordpress.com, better than sourceforge, because
wordpress.com supports SSL, closed * Lots of other improvements and bug fixes which can be found under
the git log.
