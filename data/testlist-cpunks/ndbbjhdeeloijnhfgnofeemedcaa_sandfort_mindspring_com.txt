References: I disagree.  If some judge were to make a ruling that went against the constitution, even if the case law in question was entirely within common law, his ruling would be unconstitutional and thus null an void (after it was filtered through the appellant process and invalidated of course...).  However, in practice I can think of no situation where this could occur- civil law (the primary area where common law rules) simply does not involve anything the constitution says anything about.
