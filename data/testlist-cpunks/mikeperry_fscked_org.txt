@_subject: New Torbutton (1.1.4-alpha) 
As some of you know, I've been working on a security-enhanced version
of Torbutton to handle all sorts of anonymity vulnerabilities present
in a standard Firefox configuration (see the big fat warning on
 - the goal is to make all that
text irrelevant). I will be presenting this plugin as a part of my
talk "Securing the Tor Network" for Black Hat and Defcon.
The goal of the extension is to make it possible to use modern
websites via Tor without the risk of something reducing your anonymity
set or bypassing proxy settings.
The major features are:  * Disabling plugins while Tor is enabled
 * Isolating dynamic content to the Tor state at document load
 * Cookie jars/cookie clearing
 * Cache management
 * History Management
 * User agent spoofing
 * Timezone spoofing
The extension itself, and more information on the individual
features/options are available at the horrifyingly stoic homepage:
Currently, only FireFox 2.0 is supported. Kind-hearted souls are
sought to help port to Seamonkey and Thunderbird.
Feedback, suggestions, and comments are welcome. Especially if someone
could point out what I'm doing wrong with the OpenSearch Google search
plugin installations (which are somewhat unrelated, but I figured were
worth putting up there, since a major usability complaint is "Why do I
get the damn German/Chinese/etc Google with Tor?").

@_subject: Torbutton 1.1.15-alpha released 
Torbutton 1.1.15-alpha has been released at
 Those of you who installed
Torbutton 1.1.14 should also be able to fetch the latest version
now by simply clicking Find Updates in the addons window.
This release features a number of fixes for bugs discovered by Gregory
Fleischer. Greg discovered a way to unmask the Javascript hooks for
window.screen, window.history, window.Date and window.navigator. It is
technically possible to use an unmasked window.history object in
combination with an exploit for Firefox Bug 409737 to write Javascript
that waits for Tor to be disabled to connect to a site via your IP.
The Date unmasking unfortunately has not been fixed due to
idiosyncrasies with the way the Date class is implemented in the
Firefox Javascript interpreter. This means it is possible for a
malicious website or exit node to determine your timezone if they
perform Greg's attack to unmask the original Date implementation from
behind the hooks. It appears that the only way to fix this issue is to implement a
fix for either Firefox Bug 392274 or 419598.
Here is the complete ChangeLog for 1.1.15:
 * bugfix: Fix hook unmasking of window.screen, window.history,
   and window.navigator discovered by Greg Fleischer. window.Date    unmasking is still unfixed. window.history unmasking represents
   potential IP disclosure due to Firefox Bug 409737.
 * bugfix: Fix view-source extension disclosure bug found by Greg    Fleischer.
 * bugfix: Fix javascript and about links. Found by Greg Fleischer.
 * new: Attempt to prevent window sizes from drifting during resize.

@_subject: 27C3 on Tor 
Thus spake Roc Admin (onionroutor at gmail.com):
Here's a direct link to the relevant section:
The work seems to be pretty thorough, but it would be nice to have a
paper and/or the source to their classifier. The 27c3 website doesn't
seem to list much:
The results aren't very specific in the video. It looks like they
covered the major pitfall of timing attack research (the Base Rate
Fallacy) with their presentation of the True Positive rate and the
False Positive rate, but it's not 100% clear, because there's only a
single slide with the results:
The other detail that's not clear is if you train your detector for 5
interesting websites, and 2000 uninteresting ones, what happens if the
target is browsing sites outside of those 2000 uninteresting ones?

@_subject: [tor-talk] How evil is TLS cert collection? 
Thus spake coderman (coderman at gmail.com):
Leaving this for pde and/or Seth.
The reality is we won't have the Firefox APIs to actually prevent
content load after certificate inspection any time soon, so it's not
feasible to trust this as your only security measure. Monsterous hacks
might make this possible sooner, though...
On a timescale where we can provide real security rather than just
analysis and post-pwnage notification, we can build multiple databases
to submit to/query, just like Perspectives. There's also no real reason why you can't use both Perspectives and
HTTPS-Everywhere. Then you can get both of our half-assed
after-the-fact notifications that you were owned :)
