@_subject: Barring access to Netscape 
IMHO, all the people who are planning to alter web pages to deal with the
Netscape/GAK issue should consider the following points:
(1) A recent large web site reported that 95% of their accesses were from
Netscape browsers.
(2) You want to inform the public and put pressure on Netscape, not piss
off the people using netscape browsers.  A quick, one page, detour would
seem appropriate, but not denial of access or other hostile acts.
(3) You should save some room for esclation.  (e.g. denial of access etc.) Don't hit them with everything in the first round.
(4) Any list of alternative browsers has to include at least one viable
browser for each of the major platforms.  (At least, Windows, Mac, SunOS,
Solaris, HP, AIX, BSD, Linux.  Probably a lot more.)

is way too high for the current market.  For example, my copy of Applied
Cryptography V2 cost about $.067/page AND came with the media to keep it
"forever".  My (used) copy of Snow Crash cost closer to a penny/page and

Tim is absolutely correct that the market determines the current market

However, there is not really a problem in paying for high valued web pages
(like the $400/photo consultant report he mentions).  The various network
payment schemes that have been proposed and implemented will handle these
quite adaquatly.
What concerns me is building systems that can support low-cost high-volume
markets.  If I have to pay a penny/page, I am going to ask whether Netscape
can use a whole gigabyte disk for its cache and have basically a pay/copy
system.  If the cost is low enough, I will pay/view and avoid stale data in
the cache problems.  However, there are very few systems where the
transaction costs are low enough to support low-cost high-volume markets.

" But compared with the risk of handing my credit card to a stranger, which
I do nearly every day, sending it over the Internet is pretty secure.

I agree.  I doubt we can completely eliminate the risk by technical fixes. I do think we may be able to reduce the risk below what it is in
non-cyberspace commerce.  (e.g. phone orders and in-person card
presentation).  If we can do that, and a significant part of commerce moves
to cyberspace, then we can see a reduction in the fraud premium that we all
pay (no matter who "offically" pays for it).
While cash-like instruments will be an important part of cyberspace, I
think that credit arangements may be more important.  In non-cyberspace
commerce, almost all big-ticket purchases are made with time-payment
credit.  Whether the total of the "candy bar" transactions will exceed the
total to the big-ticket transactions, I don't know.  Certainly if we are
dealing with tangable goods, shipping costs encourage large orders.

Considering that there are well known ways of spoofing IP addresses, if you

I think we lack direct charges for network traffic because detailed
accounting for use of each net-link is too expensive.  The situation is
similar to that of the telephone system in the 1950s, where the switches
which connected local calls did not have enough smarts to do charging, and
so started the tradition of "free" local calls.
When lots of people start sending full motion video over the net we may see
ISPs develop use based charging schemes.  I should add that one of the
reasons I use Netcom is that they do NOT charge for connect time or network
traffic.  There is a market for known, fixed costs too.

@_subject: Virus attacks on PGP 
PGP can be vulnerable to virus attacks.  (Similar attacks can be made on
other cipher systems.) These virus attacks can either be "Get the Key", or
"Subvert the System" attacks.  Schneier's "Rubber Hose" attack and a class
of attack which I will call "Black Bag" attacks are get the key attacks. With a black bag attack, victims do not know their keys have been stolen,
and so continue to use them.  (According to "The Puzzle Palace", NSA got
the FBI to perform black bag attacks on embassies in Washington DC.)  I
don't think subvert the system attacks have any parallel in classical
Get the Key Attacks
PGP has three keys: the secret key ring pass phrase, the secret RSA key,
and the IDEA key.  Getting any of them would constitute a successful
A virus that collects secret key rings and sends their contents somewhere,
either via UDP like messages or by dialing the modem late at night doesn't
seem to much harder to build than one that erases your hard disk.  If it
runs only once per machine, its chances of getting caught are fairly low. The standard IP error handling of "throw away the packet" means that it
probably won't be caught by firewalls.  It seems more likely that someone
will catch their computer making an unauthorized 800 number call.  This
attack would allow an opponent to use a brute force attack on the pass
Getting the pass phrase or the IDEA key requires that the virus infect
something in the PGP environment.  The infection could be to PGP itself, or
to the operating system in which it runs.  (N.B. Since Mac and PC systems
have only one protection domain, all programs running in them are part of
the operating system for the sake of this analysis.)
Assuming PGP is infected, although similar arguments apply to the operating
system, the possible mechanisms of infection are many:
  A infected PGP binary is installed
  A virus modifies disk copies of PGP
  The OS's loader is infected to modify PGP as it is loaded
  The compiler or linker is infected to modify PGP.
Any of these forms of infection could send pass phrases, secret keys, or
IDEA keys out via IP or modem.
Subvert the System Attacks
The mechanisms of infection are similar to those of the get the key
attacks, but these attacks do not require that the virus send data outside
the machine.  Instead, these attacks act by reducing the size of one of the
three key spaces, making it vulnerable to brute force attacks.  For
example, if the OS provides a "random number" service, then limiting the
randomness of the numbers constitutes an attack.  Making RSA key generation
loosely connected to the date and time constitutes an attack.
One standard defense in classical cryptography is to frequently change the
cipher keys.  The PGP web-of-trust makes changing keys difficult, and is
perhaps the weakest part of the overall protocol.
Standard defenses against viruses can help, but if the attacker is
determined and competent, then the virus will not be detected by virus
detection programs, and will not have bugs which cause noticeable ill
effects on infected machines.
Custom changes to things like random number utilities and the PGP code
itself may increase resistance by preventing some of these attacks from
identifying the modified code as its intended target.
Auditing code, preferably object code, can detect infection.  Having ALL
the source code available is almost a requirement here.
Maintaining a file of cryptographic hashs of the IDEA keys used and
checking for duplicates can detect subvert the system attacks on IDEA key
generation at the risk that the cryptographic hash is in fact invertible
and can be used to reveal the IDEA key.
Using operating systems which run in many small protection domains can
limit the opportunity for infection.  One such system I have been involved
with for over 20 years is described at the following WEB sites:

Actually keeping the pass phrase out of swap space is fairly easy (although
I havn't looked at the PGP code to see if it actually does this).  Read the
pass phrase in raw mode, one character at a time and convert it one
character at a time to the decryption key for the private RSA key.  Then
the OS doesn't need to buffer the whole line, either in kernel space or in
user space.
However, the pass phrase is not the only dangerous information. Intermediate forms used for decrypting the RSA private keys, and the
decrypted RSA private keys also have to be protected.  The logic of PGP
requires that it keep at least one of these around for a long time, so it
will probably be written to swap space.
N.B. This problem affects all virtual memory operation systems.  I can
think of the Unix/Linux family, MacOS with virtual memory turned on, and
most mainframe OSs (e.g. IBM's VM/ESA).

Good point.  Too bad the invocations of pinning aren't portable.  Maybe in

All the OSs I am familar with pin the pages only for the duration of the
I/O operation.  After the I/O has completed, the page can be swapped out. What you really need is to pin the page in memory (with an implicit
contract with your OS that it won't be written to swap space while it is
pinned), put the sensitive information in the page, use the information,
wipe the information, and un-pin the page.

Ah, but there is a neat hack that works well if you can dedicate the whole

multi-tasking is a harder excersize).  Credit where credit is due, I first
saw this technique used, probably in 1968, on the IBM/360 (60HZ clock) with
a pair of programs called PACER and RATER.
Monitor the clock location.  (It doesn't matter whether it is incrmented by
hardware or software.)  Run a timing loop from when it changes until it
changes again and count the number of times through the loop.  Then use the
same timing loop and count how many times the loop runs from a clock tick
to the event of interest (or from the event of interest to the next clock
tick).  Use the ratio of the two counts to interprolate between the times
you can get from the clock.
You have used the processor's instruction rate to synthesize a better clock.

This application sounds perfect for Bloom filters.  The basic idea of a
Bloom filter is to build a database by taking each word in the dictionary
and hashing with N different hashes.  The hashes do not need to by
cryptographically secure, but they do need to be good hashes, XOR doesn't
make it.  You use those hashes as bit offsets in a giant bit map, which is
the database.  When building the database you turn on the bits at each of
these N locations.
When accessing the database, you hash the chunk of text with the same
hashes, and then test the bits in the database at those offsets.  If any of
the bits are zero, then the chunk of text is not in the dictionary.
The failure mode is to say something is in the dictionary when it isn't. If half the bits in the database are on, then the probability of failure is
2**(-N), so if N==10, then the failure rate is 1 in 1024.  If empirically,
you get a higher failure rate, check the quality of your hashes.
For cryptanalysis, I might pick a higher N and eyeball check for failures. Say you want 1 in a million failure rate, and have an 80,000 word
dictionary.  You need a 20 * 80,000 * 2 bit database, which is 400,000

basically a spinner.  In looking over the detailed data (which I have not
copied), it appears to me that even adding the 3rd order deltas may leave
the actual entropy overestimated.  The source of entropy is basically the
system scheduler.  It is a deterministic process, which depends slightly on
the somewhat less deterministic processes of I/O interrupts etc.  I feel
uncomfortable estimating 1 bit/second from it, and prefer to accept Wai
Dai's zero bits/second.
One severe problem we seem to have is that all automatic entropy estimation
techniques tend to over-estimate the amount of entropy present.

approach maximizes revenue by selling you products you don't need as a

There are some features of Java which make it less than ideal for crypto
applications.  These features can be overcome, but they will affect
implementors and users.
(1) There are not many sources of high-quality entropy available to Java
applets.  Keystroke timings and scribble windows are probably the best
sources, but may represent an inconvenience for users.
(2) Java doesn't allow you to define operators as methods of classes.  This
feature has the advantage that you don't have strange uses of the
operators, the classic example being the left shift operator being used to
do output.  However, if you need to do arithmetic on numbers larger than 64

on the privileged mode state, it may be hard to exploit the ability to
switch to privileged mode.  With maps which allow access to the user's
address space while in privileged mode (e.g. Solaris), it may be possible
to just keep running, and so complete a successful attack.
On the other hand, with most systems I have seen, setting yourself into
privileged state will persist thru the next interrupt.  The system Norm and
I worked on would detect it later.  (It checked every 5 minutes or so.) The IBM operating systems I have used would not detect, or correct this
The ray  of hope in this area is that there are so many other easier
attacks on modern systems.  People will have a tendency to use them first.

@_subject: [LONG] Churchill Club: 20th Anniversary PK Crypto 
The moderator, David Morris of Cylink, introduced the field by discussing
the problems of corporate espionage, and privacy concerns vs. public and
private databases.  He said that the old security paradigms present with
face to face business don't work with electronic commerce.
He introduced Jim Omura, who gave an overview of PK encryption and
introduced Martin Hellman, Ralph Merkle, and Whitfield Diffie.  Louis
Morris, Cylink CEO, presented them with inscribed glass trophies.
Hellman described the key to the early years as being willing to be a fool,
because you need to step out of the standard thought patterns.  Diffie
described the genesis from 1974 to 1978 as going from Merkle's paper,
"Secure Communication Over Insecure Channels", thru DH key exchange, to
RSA.  Since 1976 is the center of gravity of these steps, this year makes a
good 20th anniversary.  Merkle said it is most striking how long it has
taken to be adopted.  Networks lead to a need for security, lead to a
questioning of regulations on Crypto, which leads to changes in those
regulations.  Diffie said it is absolutely amazing that it is happening so
quickly.  "How wonderfully lucky it is we started working 20 years ago."
Senator Larry Pressler (R, SD) was introduced via video projector from
Washington D.C.  He talked about bad government rules and that government
should help or at least get out of the way.  He talked about the need for
exports and to assist US multi-national businesses.  The controls hurt US
companies.  Encryption is the future of industry.  If we don't fix the
export problem, there are two outcomes.  (1) Foreign competition will
provide the function, or (2) US companies will move the R&D offshore. Either will cost US jobs.  After listing his [off topic] pet bills, he
mentioned that he was talking about encryption in software.  He said
Senator Burns' bill will be introduced tomorrow.
Senator Conrad Burns (R, MT) spoke from the podium in a joke filled speech.
 He talked about the Telecom Bill as a way to do something about giving
more people access to the glass highway.  He talked about the problem of
how do we make sure that people have agreed to a deal on the highway and
supporting sales.  He said we need the crypto bill to support them.  His
bill provides for, (1) Export of publicly available software (e.g. PGP and
browsers), (2) no GAK, (3) limiting the authority of the Department of
Commerce to set standards, and (4) export to countries which equivalent
technology.  He wants to have public hearings in Silicon Valley.
Then questions came from the floor:
Q: Why are we streamlining the Department of Commerce when the Department
of State and NSA are the problem?
Burns: Legislation will deal with this problem and prevent them from
blocking export.  You may still need a license, but there should be no
Pressler: We need to streamline relations between State and Commerce in
this area.  We need to streamline trade in hi tech.  I don't think that
state and NSA should have the say.  Export is a trade problem.  It is a
"disaster for American exports."
Burns: We are going to need grass-roots support to pass this bill.
Q: Where do California's senators (Feinstein and Boxer) stand?
Burns: We don't know.
Pressler: We didn't have their support on tort reform.  Stick with your
friends and work for them.
Q: Who is against the bill?
Burns: People who listen to NSA.  People who feel the US needs to be able
to watch you.
Q: How do you expect administration opposition to show up?
A: We don't know yet.
Q: Currently encryption is classified as a munition.  Will your legislation
reclassify it.
Pressler: We don't see encryption as a threat to national security.  People
in Washington D.C. who make a living suppressing information oppose the
Burns: We need your knowledge to pass this bill.
The senators bid us goodbye and the Congressman Robert Goodlatte (R, VA)
was introduced.  He said that President Clinton testified for 4.5 hours
over an encrypted communication link on the McDougall trial.  His bill is
called Security And Freedom thru Encryption (SAFE).  Local congressmen
Campbell and Eshoo are co-sponsors.  We need to broaden the base of support
for this bill.  Everyone should talk to their customers/vendors/and
companies with web sites about this issue.  If we don't change the rules,
it could cost $60B in 2000.  There are 500 foreign encryption software
products.  He talked about how fast 40 and 56 bit encryption could be
cracked and said that, in his opinion, the administration's desire to read
everything, foreign and domestic is the greatest threat.  He argues it is
the wrong approach and we should be encouraging everyone to use encryption
routinely.  We need it for counter terrorism against attacks on computer
systems used in design, manufacturing and e.g. controlling nuclear power
plants.  We need your help getting the word out.  Write your member of
congress.  We will have hearings on the bill in the next month or two.
Q: What do you say to techies/CEOs who want to run for public office?
A: Well are you a Democrat or Republican? (laughter).  Seriously, congress
needs a variety of backgrounds to help with technical issues.  Get good
expert advice on running your campaign.
James Freeman, Special Agent in Charge, San Francisco Office, FBI,
discussed the tools the FBI needs to do its job.  He talked about foreign
espionage on US companies.  He mentioned 800 cases involving 23 countries,
20% in the SF Bay area.  Counterfeit drugs cost US drug companies
$1.5B/year.  The FBI does not have adequate laws to pursue theft of
intellectual property.  It could use a computer fraud/abuse law.  In the last few years, the FBI and local law enforcement have identified 9
gangs dealing in stolen electronic components thru undercover operations
and wiretaps.  Each set of arrests have reduced the rate of reported armed
robbery.  They used RICO to help prosecute these gangs.  He stated the FBI
can do the same for intellectual property given the right tools.
He stated that in some cases, foreign students are sent here to spy on US
corporations.  In some cases they are released from military service for
their spying.  Inside theft is responsible for most spying, but hacking and
computer intrusion are increasing.
He said that terrorists, money launders, drug dealers using crypto is a
serious threat, and he thinks GAK is a good solution.  If congress takes
GAK away from law enforcement, they will use the tools they have.  However
we need a balanced approach.
Q: If any high school student can implement unbreakable crypto, what can you do?
A: Regulation of crypto is the responsibility of congress.
Edward Kozel of Cisco Systems spoke about the problems they have had with
the export regulations.  He said that the Internet was important because it
lowered the barriers to market entry.  He offered the example that the big
3 American auto manufactures are requiring network links for their
suppliers.  He talked about attacks on hosts and networks.  He said that
right now, Atlanta is a boom area for telecommuting because Atlanta
companies fear the Olympics will bring gridlock this summer.  He suggested
micro payments as a solution to copyright problems.  We must see the
problem as a global problem.  PK is a fundamental component of commerce,
authentication, and non-repudiation.
Q (Dave Del Toro (sp?)): RSA patent license imposes significant limitations
on what we can do with RSA.  How can we overcome that barrier?
Morris (Cylink): Cylink owns the DH patents.  We are opening the technology
with no-cost licenses.  Patents should not be used to block the technology.
Kozel: We certainly support open dissemination.  In 1990 we couldn't export
routers to e.g. Russia.  So they used PCs and public domain software to
build their nets.  Now they are converting to routers.  Now is the time to
unleash encryption.
Q: What is the best way to go given the new laws and IPv6?
Kozel: 40 bits is no good.  Even people in rural Australia know that. Industry needs to recognize the need for controls, if only by the customer.
 The technology is moving to the mass market.  Encryption will be needed to
keep everyone from reading data on cable networks.
Paul Raines, Project Manager, United States Postal Service described the
post offices digital postmark and certificate services.  Cylink is the
technical developer.  The post office brings four things that private
industry can't: (1) The postal fraud statutes, (2) A long track record and
well established reputation, (3) 40,000 existing post offices (vs. 10,000
McDonald's), and (4) it can act as a trusted third party.
Q: How much will you charge for these services and when will they be available?
A: Postmarking: $.10, 7/96.  Certificates: $10-$15/person/year, 4Q96.
Q: Do you see the post office acting as an ISP?
A: Only to the extent necessary to provide electronic delivery of digital
postmarks and certificates.
Q: Do you see the post office going into transaction verification?  What
limits your future business directions?
A: We will make sure not to compete with private business.  Because we must
go through a rate commission to change prices makes it hard to compete.
The evening closed with a Diffie, Hellman, Merkle panel.
Hellman: After these 20 years, I feel less of a fool.  When we wrote "New
Directions in Cryptography" in 1976, we envisioned our ideas would be
widespread in five years.
Diffie: I was excessively optimistic about the spread of PKC in two of my
Hellman: We were off for two reasons.  (1) Lack of public concern.  With
cell phone fraud approaching 40% that may change.  And (2) ITAR.  This new
legislation will have a very positive effect.
Merkle: I wish I could pipe the comments this evening back 20 years.  I
would particular like to pipe them to my rejection letter from
Communications of the ACM which said my contribution was not mainstream. One is often over optimistic about the early rate of progress and under
optimistic about the later rate.  OK, I was wrong before, but things are
going to happen fast now.
Morris: Where are the new frontiers?
Diffie: Quantum computing (if it works).  Elliptic curve crypto.  The next
decade or so will be used to sort out the social effects.  Passive
listening by major governments is moving to active computer penetration. What will our high-level security specifications be?  What are fair rules
for intellectual property, privacy etc?
We closed with David Morris reading email from Phil Mellinger, Chief
Engineer, Government Securities Association.  He said the US and Canada are
discussing inter operability on Certificate authorities.  The government is
using DH with DES and SHA for government communications.  Short of the
automobile, PKC has had the largest effect on the world of any 20th century
Impressions:  In conversation afterwards, I noted that discussion of
personal privacy seemed to be politically incorrect in this group.  Unless
it directly supported corporate commerce, we didn't discuss it.

Well, under Cryptoanarchy the whole problem disappears.  Your medical
records are handled as per your contract with your doctor.  There are no
3rd party payers who have a stake.  With no taxes, the deduction for
medical savings plans disappears and with it the principle reason for them.
 (People would still need to save for medical costs.)
The risk of catastrophic illness is indeed significant, but statistically
rare.  If we assume people will insure for it, and insurance companies
still have access to the records of the care they pay for, then we are
still better off than we are today with all care being paid by insurance
companies.  In this scenario, routine medical care is being paid by the
patient, and the records can be private between the patient and the doctor.
 This kind of system would prevent the general availability of information
such as whether a patient had a vasectomy.
Note that in the general case, people are healthy in their youth, and can
build up savings for when health problems develop with age.  TANSTAAFL.  On
the average, everyone has to pay the cost of their medical care.
I have no problem letting my doctor know my medical history protected by
doctor-patient confidentiality.  It's the insurance company/human resources
department/government access I worry about.

The insurance companies have every reason to perform "Utilization Reviews",
since only they have incentive to contain costs.  Our medical plans tend to
insure for routine medical care and as a result, give the insurance
companies the data about our routine care.  If they only paid for
catastrophic illness and accident care, they would only have reason to have
data on that care.
Do you want to share the risk of routine medical care?  Or do you just want
to share the risk of catastrophic illnesses and accidents?  Or do you want
to keep it all private.  What you pay for, you can keep private.  What they
pay for, they can review.  Your choice.

RC2 and RC4 are both both variable key length cyphers developed by Ron
Rivest for RSA Data Security Inc.  They were both protected by trade
secret, but both have been reverse engineered and posted to the net.  Both
of them have fast-path export approval if their key length is 40 bits or
MD5 (Message Digest 5) is not a cypher but a secure hash.  If takes an
input of variable length and computes a 128 bit hash.  Recently some
weaknesses have been found in MD5 leading to the recomendation that new
applications be coded to use SHA1 instead.
As a note: Any good secure hash can be used as a symetric key cypher. Usually doing so involves considerably more computation than a symetric
cypher of equal strength.

* Pooling of resources in this manner lets the taxpayer's money go further.
* NSA etc. could solve the problem of which companies to give their
commercial intelligence to by selling it to the highest bidder.  These
sales could possibly replace their current off-books funding kludge.
* As more is learned of the listening network, there is less incentive to
keep it secret, and more incentive to publicly use the intercepts.  This
incentive for secrecy has probably protected many individuals in the past.

For example, most operating system kernels have a global pointer to the
current process.  Assembly language kernels normally dedicate a register to
hold that pointer.  In C, each separately compiled routine must re-load it
from its memory location because they can not coordinate register usage.
Parameter passing is another place this kind of global register assignment
can improve assembly programs.
Another place where this global view of a program helps is in re-loads
after calling externally compiled routines.  The compiler must assume that
the external routine has changed the variable while a smart programmer can
know better and save the re-load.  Even if the data is in the level 1
cache, most architectures can do at most one memory reference instruction
per cycle, and memory accesses seem to be the critical path for OS kernels.
These optimizations work better with register rich architectures such as
the R4000, Sparc, PowerPC etc. than they do on the popular Intel
architecture because there are more registers to use.
BTW - My experience with Assembler over C is more like 4:1 than 2:1.  YMMV!

It depends on the level of compatibility you need.  If you need bug-for-bug
compatibility, then you get the security bugs too.  The only advantage you
have is being able to run two "systems" on one set of hardware.
If you allow some non-compatibilities, then things get better.  We had a
Unix running on KeyKOS which would run much of the Unix functionality.  For
example, we ran a number of the X demos.  On our IBM/370 version, we ran
IBM's CMS system with binary compatibility.  We used it for our development
environment, including editing, source management, compiling etc.  (There
was one IBM product we did not run.  It needed to read real-addresses to
grunge through system control blocks we hadn't emulated.  Since it had no
interface documentation, we would have had to look at its accesses, figure
out what it wanted, and simulate it.  Too much work for what was a pretty
bad product.)

Applets in a separate protection domain because it would be relatively easy.

@_subject: Executing Encrypted Code 
Let me try to sketch a design for an Encrypted Code Computer (ECC).
I will start with what has become the standard architecture for Personal
Computers/Workstations.  That is:
(1) One or more CPU chips, each of which includes a RISC core, memory
management, and L1 cache.
(2) A L2 cache memory chip.
(3) A main memory bus which either includes an I/O bus or,
(4) A separate I/O bus.
If we decrypt the code on the disk, we gain almost no piracy protection
over current systems, so we must decrypt somewhere in the memory hierarchy.
If we decrypt on the main memory bus, then it will be easy to add bus
snooping hardware to catch the unencrypted program as it is accessed.
While average computer user may not do this, the foreign pirates certainly
will.  Basically the same argument applies to decrypting in the L2 cache,
since it will be easy to sample the signals between the L2 cache and the
That leaves us with decrypting in the CPU.  Most CPU chips have separate
instruction and data L1 caches.  If we assume separate caches for our
system, it becomes logical to decrypt the code as we load it into the L1
cache.  If we assume that we are using public key cryptography to protect
the programs, where the CPU chip has the only copy of the secret key, then
we have to solve the following problems:
(1) We have to decrypt each code line in a few cycles or the system's
performance will be much worse that a similar system without encryption.
(2) We must decrypt cache lines accessed in a basically random manner.
Point (1) means we probably want to encrypt the code with a symmetric
cypher and then encrypt the symmetric key with the CPU's public key.  There
will need to be a way of telling the CPU, "Here's a new encrypted symmetric
key for code."  To avoid having to do a public key decryption on every
process/program switch, the CPU will need a cache of symmetric keys, and
the OS will have to tell it which key-cache entry to use at any point
during execution of the program.  There will have to be a way to
automatically change the key when servicing an interrupt.
Point (2) means we can't use any of the really good encryption modes, and
are pretty much limited to ECB like modes.  If we use straight ECB mode,
then our program becomes subject to a number of cypher-text only attacks.
If we can arrange our software system so code always executes at a constant
virtual address we can reduce these attacks by salting the code cache
blocks with the virtual address.  However, constant virtual addresses make
DLLs somewhat difficult.
Given this design, we need a symmetric cypher which can be decrypted with a
logic array shallower than about 100 gates (which works out to about 5
clock cycles).  We are still going to pay a performance penalty because we
are adding clocks to a critical performance path, but perhaps we can get
Steve Jobs to sell it to the masses :-).
We still have a major problem if we want a multiprocessor system.  How do
we migrate threads between processors?  It seems that we need to have the
same key on all processors (or license and keep in memory multiple copies
of the code).  If we allow the keys off-chip, then recovering them becomes
much easier.  If we keep them on-chip, then the CPU manufacturer needs to
build CPU chips which share a secret key, with all the attendant inventory
problems etc.  (And, if I can move the CPU chips to different systems, then
I can run a single key of the software on multiple systems.)

If your algorithm is only for domestic use, then there are no restrictions

then you may experience a situation similar to Phill Zimmerman's where the

However judge Patell's decision, if it is applied to you, may make the
export of an academic or even source code description of your algorithm
legal.  YMMV.
IMHO, the bottom line is that if you publish in this area you are stepping
onto a battle ground.  If you don't want any risk of getting shot at, the
only safe place is not publishing/selling.  If you do publish or sell, and
take reasonable precautions to stay within the law, you are fairly safe,
but government harassment can not be ruled out.

@_subject: Hardening lists against spam attacks 
The Christmas attack against this list shows the need to develop lists
which are resistant to attacks.  If cyberspace is to become the town square
of the next century, we need to be able to discourage brown shirts attacks
on political gatherings.  If lists are to be a major part of the political
life of the community, then they must be resistant to attacks from
knowledgeable, well financed attackers, not just the shits who were the
most recent perps.
There are several principles which should be observed:
(1) Since attacks are based on sending to the list, receiving the list
should remain substantially unchanged.
(2) Spam attacks should be throttled at the source, so they do not act as a
denial of service attack on the list server.
Here is a sketch of a protocol which attempts to achieve these goals:
(1) All messages sent to the list must be encrypted with the list's public
key.  This requirement is primarily to protect the posting token (see
below).  However, it alone will probably reduce the problem.  Certainly it
will eliminate the effectiveness of the "subscribe the list to some other
list" attacks.
(2) In order to post to the list, the poster must have a valid posting
token.  These tokens are available, in limited number, anonymously.  Tokens
remain valid unless canceled for abuse.  However, if too many posts are
received with a given token, TCP performance on sockets using that token
may become arbitrarily slow (or the circuit may be dropped).
(3) In order to limit the number of posting tokens, the list server will
only issue a few per day.  The lucky few who get them, everyone who asks
under normal circumstances, may be determined by an algorithm designed to
limit token collection by future attackers.  (This area is where this
proposal needs work!)

Consider the Movie rating system as a precedent.  In the old days there was
a rating system in Hollywood which made it impossible to show a married

where George Carlin's 7 naughty words may not be spoken.
Contrast that with today's movies.  There is a much wider latitude about
the movies you can make and distribute.  All you have to do is label them
NC-17, R. or X and you are clean.  Of course, there are newspapers which
will not allow you to advertise and theaters which will not show the
X/NC-17 movies, but that's the way the market works.
With some luck, we will be able to see on TV what we can now see in the
movie theater, and the prudes will screen it out with the V-Chip the same
way they now screen it out with the movie rating.  Everyone is (more or
less) happy.

not need to make public appearences.
Adding money to the pot will attract rational (and amoral) people who will

[I've changed the Subject: to more accurately reflect the contents]
My purpose on this thread is to examine the limits of Jim Bell's idea of
Assassination Politics.  My ground rules are to assume that it is a natural
outgrowth of the technologies of anonymous cash and anonymous remailers. As such arguments that it is immoral are only valid to the extent that they
bare on individual's decisions to particpate in an assassination.
I believe that we have general agreement that high government figures are
not subject to sanction via assassination politics because they already
enjoy Secret Service levels of protection.
I also believe that Jim and I disagree about the significance of Salmon
Rushdie.  Jim thinks that the lack of anonymity in the Mullah's
assassination bounty is repelling possible assassins.  I disagree.  A
question worth asking is, How much does it cost the British government to
protect Mr. Rushdie by keeping his location secret and providing other
unspecified protection.  If anyone knows the answer, it could help build an
economic model of Assassination Politics.
Jim Bell said:
I agree that Jim's idea of targeting certain specific individuals, such as
the sniper above might work.
However if you tackle the whole tax system, you get into problems of scale.
 The IRS alone (according to their web page) has over 110,000 employees,
and we havn't even mentioned the state and local employees.  I don't think
killing one or two will have a sigificant effect (that is occuring now).  I
will assume that you have to successfully kill about 10% to have enough
effect to shut off the government's money supply.
Attacks at this scale will be difficult because while people will have
perfect anonymity in cyberspace, they won't enjoy it in physical space. Neighbors, survalence cameras, etc.; in fact all the technology that makes
privacy so hard to achieve today will be available to catch the assassins. The police will also be more motivated to utilize the technology for this
class of people than they would for drug dealers, pimps and other low
lifes.  These points will tend to raise the price of assassinations.
Let us assume that we can buy assassinations for $50,000 per person.  Times
11,000 people is $550 million dollars.  That is quite a sum.  I need to see

Having, in the past, attempted to sell an Operating System with high

an OS will do is allow someone in an obscure department (perhaps called
Corporate Security) to say no.
Security is a checkoff item, and if you can convince a retired major that
the OS is secure, then he will approve it.  He is not going to check the
details.  His expertise is in guard stations and chain link fences. However, if someone, e.g. the trade press, rubs his nose in the fact that
an OS's security can be breached, then he will take action.  He will
pressure the publisher to release a fix that they say will fix the problem.
 When they do, he will be happy.
Microsoft particulary, is oriented to selling product, not pride in workmanship.

I agree that firewalling every machine would be extreemly difficult with

hacker tools are available from root and everyone has access to root.  With
systems that provide better isolation, it becomes possible to dedicate the
network interface to the protection domain which is running the firewall
code.  You also need to divide up the administration so the direct user
does not break that isolation.
BTW, IBM's VM/370 (and successors) has good isolation and could probably

I think you have a very different view of rating than I do.  For example, I
would be comfortable rating all the Sesame Street shows for sex and
violence without seeing any more than I have seen, just based on the
reputation of the show's producers.  Based on reviews in the newspaper
(since the net has replaced TV for me), most of the current network shows
can also be rated for all their episodes.  Remember also, there is an
"unrated" catagory.  Some people will refuse to access unrated material. Others, (I suspect you and I) may seek it out.
One possible addition to search engines would be to give the people who
have actually viewed the video/web page etc. an opportunity to rate it on
any of several criteria including whether they thought it was worth their
time.  Other people could then use these ratings as they wanted (including
ignoring them).  The big problem I see would be making the system easy
enough to use to get a reasonable response.

explore the consiquences, both technical and social, of taking the control

less likely that they will succeed.  However, unlike the motion picture

Ballpark estimate:  If the encryptor receives a complete packet before

If the encryptor encrypts "on the fly", passing the bits of a packet as
their are received, then it would add almost no latency.  However, the

I worked with an algorithm which sounds similar to this one back about 20
years ago when creating a diff for VM/370 at Tymshare.  Here's a quick
description of the algorithm so you can see how much the hashing discussion
below applies to your problem.
(1) Chose a way to break the files into "units".  We chose line ends.
(2) Hash each unit in both files making two vectors of hashes.
(3) Identify which units exist once and only once in a file by:
(3a) Initialize a (large) vector of 2-bit entries to all zeros.
(3b) Use the hash of each unit to index the vector.  If the entry is 00
change it to 01.  If it is 01 change it to 10.  If it is 10 leave it alone.
(4) And the two 2-bit entry vectors together to get the units that exist
once and only once in both files.  These units are anchors of similarity
between the files.
(5) Find the hashes which represent these anchors of similarity in both
files and link them together.
(6) Link the neighbors of already linked units.
(7) The unlinked hashes represent differences between the two files.
Note that this algorithm finds units that have been moved.  I had to do
something intelligent with this information to allow for diff-like output.
To handle binary files you may need to change the definition of "unit".
We used a simple barber poll hash.  We went for a number of years before we
had a hash failure.  (I know, there was a bug in the code that handled hash
failures.)  A hash based on a CRC calculation would probably be better.

I expect this problem can usually be handled without formal CAs.  If you
publish your PGP key fingerprint in your advertising and make the key
available on your web page, then your users have a way of independently
verifying your key.  As the finger print appears in more and more places
(letterhead, product packaging, etc.), it is less and less likely that your
attacker can reach them all to modify them.
The important thing is diverse paths.  If you include your key in the
package with the product and print the fingerprint on the outside, it
becomes relatively easier for your attacker to replace the whole thing as
part of an attack.

The obvious counter is to use the key management infrastructure for
authentication, but use a technique like Diffie-Hellman to decide on a
session key.  I see two problems with this approach:
(1) It still allows traffic analysis.
(2) It will be difficult to implement for one-way transmissions (e.g. email).
A more complex structure would overcome (2) above.  Use you GAK key to sign
your PGP key.  Post your PGP key on the MIT server (or successors), and
people who want non-GAKed communication with you would use your PGP key,
with the benefit of government approved authentication.
I still think this whole GAK thing is going to fail on the, "Which
government?" question.  I don't see either multi-nationals or their
governments wanting to share their secrets with each other, and I don't see
how to set up universal GAK to prevent that form of industrial espionage. Also, the key which decodes the GAKed data is just too valuable and too
easy to steal.

Sometimes paranoia strikes.  Since these musings are crypto related, I
thought I would share them.
(1) Now everyone knows that 40 bit RC4 is weak, but just how weak is it? We know that a university CS student can break one message in a week using
the universities farm of workstations.  But, our foremost reputation agency
for crypto strength, the ITAR, allows systems with RC4-40 to be exported. What does this mean?
I combine the above with Whit Diffie's observation that, while crypto users
are interested in the security of *each* message, organizations which
monitor communications want to read *every* message.  A TLA interested in
monitoring communications would need to crack RC4-40 much faster than
Now expensive specialized cracking equipment can certainly speed up the
process, but there may be a better way.  If cryptanalysis of RC4 yields
techniques which make the process much easier, then it is the ideal cypher
to certify for export.
The paranoid conclusion is that there is a significant weakness in RC4.
(2) What did Microsoft give up to export its crypto API?
Well, if you were a TLA, what would you want.  I think I would want an
agreement to be able to insert my own code in that vendor's products.  Then
I would be able to have widely distributed Trojan horses signed by the
vendor.  I would have the opportunity to significantly weaken standardized
crypto systems installed world wide.

I'm really feeling much better now :-).
IMHO, NSA's cryptanalysis is second to none.  I have been assuming a
weakness based on a classified cryptanalysis technique.  They have
certainly been thinking about "S-Box" cyphers since at least Lucifer and
DES.  But let's approach the question from a different angle.  Consider the
number of messages that need to be broken and the costs of machines to do
How many encrypted messages do you think NSA wants to read?  I have no idea
either, but in the spirit of never depend on expert opinion when simple
arithmetic will do, let's assume a world where major email packages use
encryption as a matter of course.  If we assume that the 30 million net
users send one email/day, then that results in about 350/second.  If I
assume your "several thousand" is 2000, then we need a machine with 700,000
FPGA's.  Given Matt Blaze et. al.'s estimate of $10/chip complete, that is
$7 million.  However if you take the NSA's estimate (in their response to
Blaze et al) of $1000/chip, then you get $700 million.
If we assume a machine designed to break *every* message, NSA's response
makes more sense.  From their response (reordered):
It needs to store all the messages it is attacking.
It needs to get all those messages into the machine, the plaintext out, and
distribute the data to the FPGAs.
Fast machines produce a lot of heat.
R&D costs for high-speed I/O, large memories, and efficient heat removal
might be significant.
This is one of Blase et. al.'s simplifying assumptions.  RC4 has a simple
key setup and runs faster than DES.  Brute forcing 40 bit Blowfish would be
considerably harder.  Probably about equal to 9 additional key bits harder.
Now I have no problem with believing NSA would invest $7 million.  However,
$700 million makes me wonder.  With FPGAs, there is a significant risk that
people will change the crypto system and make the investment worthless. (Which, I guess, is why they prefer general purpose computers.)  However,
if they can get the equivalent of a few bits of key back by cryptanalysis,
then they knock the costs down to entirely reasonable (for them) levels.

@_subject: FPGAs and Heat (Re: Paranoid Musings) 
I have really scrambled up the quotes from verious people.  My appologies
if you think I have misrepresented your viewpoints.
One of NSA's traditional roles is to automatically scan communications and
pull out the "interesting" stuff.  To continue this role, they have to be
able to decrypt the messages.  I wouldn't, particularly when thinking in
paranoid mode, assume they have given up on that role.
I was assuming program only once chips, like the old burn-the-fuse PROMs. If you are ordering in quantity 700,000, for the RC4-40 engine, then you
have no need to worry about the cost of small runs of Mask programmed
If they are using Programmable-only-once Gate Arrays or Mask programmed
ones, $700 million for a machine which will cost $7 million for a simple
reprogramming might give them pause.  Or at least make them consider if
there is an alternative.  If they are using easily reprogrammable arrays,
then they have a general purpose computer specialized for certain types of
parallel processing.  If this machine cost $100 million, I agree they would
probably build it.
I feel like I'm leaning over backwards to defend NSA's response, an
extremely uncomfortable position (and I could crack my skull when I fall)
:-).  The most important issue is, what is NSA's state of the art.  If we
accept their $1000/FPGA chip, then they are indeed at the bleeding edge,
and suffering from the associated low chip yields.  If they are at the best
cost-performance point for 2-3 years ago or whenever they started approving
the export of RC4-40, then they are certainly subject to David Wagner's
performance limits.
A number of people have mentioned the heat problems.  I, and I think also
NSA, never said they couldn't be solved, but solving them involves
engineering costs, whether it is to design cooling or distribution
techniques.  I think the bullets in their response were primarily to
justify that $10 million NRE cost.  (Getting to $10 million isn't hard on a
government project.)
Given this kind of hardware, the only reasonable assumption is that if NSA
hasn't built a general purpose cracking engine, they will.
The idea of a genetic system to "learn" an unknown cypher system and then
brute force crack it is indeed worth a paper, perhaps several.

I'll say.  You have also ignored some of Java's other features.  Machine
independence is probably the most important.  A nice, small, easy to learn
language is another.
[As an aside, when I attempted to compile Wai Dei's crypto lib 2.0 with the
Symantec Project Manager C++ compilers, none of the 3 would compile it. The one which generated the fewest errors had "internal error" on two
modules.  This problem occurs because C++ is such a large language, with a
number of obscure features which compiler writers don't always handle.  In
addition, C++ is in no way machine independent.  The simplest example is
that sizeof(int) is machine dependent.]
If you want defense in depth, run your Java interpreter in an OS
environment which limits the interpreter's access to only those resources
you wish it to access.
I get the impression that the environment you are concerned with is a bunch
of PCs running W95 or NT.  These OSs are fragile enough, particularly to
the denial of service attacks your users can not tolerate, that the only
way to approach safety is to only run software which has been approved by
an in-house testing authority.  Even with the in-house testing authority,
you really need a better OS to protect against testing failures.
There have been discussions of crypto applications in Java.  Doing the
crypto on the user's system before sending data thru the net is a useful
application.  While, as a number of us have pointed out, there are problems
doing crypto with Java, it may be the easiest way to deliver strong crypto
quickly to Joe Websurfer.
In the long run, I hope to use Java to sell cycles.  Java has the advantage
in a cycle market that it is machine independent, and the Just In Time

I guess I tend to react to the Java hype with bemusement rather than
horror.  I enjoy joking with the clerks at Computer Literacy Bookstore
about the "Java book of the day".  However, unlike so much of the
industry's over hyped marketing, with Java there is actually something
worth while hidden under the massive hype.
Java appears to have a chance of being adopted widely in the industry.  We
can discuss until the cows come home why Smalltalk, Scheme etc. have not
achieved wide usage.  I suspect it may be a combination of unfamiliar
syntax, licensing issues, version compatibility issues, and the inability
to do low level programming.  These issues may also hit Java, but for now
it is the nicest language around with a bandwagon behind it.  If it
replaces Basic, that will be a significant step forward.
I agree that all the hype has been about applets.  However there is one
common non-applet Java application that shows that significant applications
can be written in Java.  That application is the Java compiler itself.  If
you are running on a Sun system, you can do real applications today.  (On
the Mac you are still in the "applet jail", but I haven't opened the latest
Java environment that arrived on my desk last month, so I may be obsolete.)
I thought this was the effect the Unix people get when they run
applications such as firewall code in a "chroot jail".  Perhaps Netscape
could make you happy by having its Unix based browsers run Java applet
interpreters in such a jail.  (I don't know, Unix is an imperfectly spoken
foreign language to me.)

This is, of course, an opportunity for agents (programmed, or two legged)
to use their superior knowledge of the service/technology/business to
optimize service for ordinary people.
I think that agent providers would gain reputations.  Many consumers might
trust an agent from Consumer's Union for example.  If there end up being
only a few types of agent, then I would expect to see an "arms race"
between charging systems and agents.  The providers would try to devise
charges which maximize their profit, while the agents would try to get the
best combination of service and cost for their users.  This race would be
similar to the situation we see in the telephone industry, with its
continuously changing "special long distance deals".
I assume any user interface will be in terms of the user's interests. Since these interests will change over time as the environment and user's
knowledge change, the UI will be a hard problem.  However, the UI will be
another factor in the user's agent selection process. With the current low speed dialup connections, the savings on billing costs
are probably greater than the costs of bandwidth "over use".
Even a cash based payment system will have costs.  The lowest cost IP
payment system I know of, Norm Hardy's Digital Silk Road, has the cost of
increasing the complexity of the IP routers.  There is no free lunch here. Whether you call it accounting, billing, or micropayment; it is an

I find this analysis a bit superficial because it does not consider the

of the timber industry.  Before the late 1980s, the lands owned by Pacific
Lumber were managed for long-term production.  When the company was taken
over as part of the "maximize present value" movement in the late 1980s,
the management goals changed to increase timber production without regard
to long-term production.  (I seem to remember that the takeover was one of
Michael Milken's deals.)
My conclusion from this example is that if your interest is in the
long-term preservation of ecosystems, you need institutions that are

short-term trends in markets.  As far as I can tell, the US National Park

On thinking about your rant, I think you have a valid point.  What our
venture capitalists said to us was, "There is no market for security."  Now
perhaps the ITAR helps suppress that market on the basis of, "If I'm going
to have to wander the information superhighway naked, why should I shut the
blinds on my house."  Given no market, and the requirement to support
everything you ever supported, it is hard to justify building in security
I have a client who provides services to part of the DOD.  (My contract
prevents me from being more specific.)  Their only saving grace is they
don't use the Internet or Unix.  (Making them vulnerable to a much smaller
group of hackers.)
The ideal situation for them would be to use public key authentication
because it would be entirely user-transparent.  Doing OTP's the way Apple
does them (see below) would also work well.  However, to implement one of
these systems requires modifying a bunch of terminal emulator programs from
different vendors (some of whom are no longer in business).  Without widely
adopted standards for OTP logon, these modifications are not likely to
I think that backward compatibility requirements are a significant part of
the reason we see this problem.  The other part is, of course, that there
is no market for security.
Apple has a form of one time passwords in their file sharing system.  When
you enter your password, it is used as a key to encrypt a challenge sent by
the file server (Using a symmetric cypher).  The result is returned,
decrypted and compared with the original challenge.  But this system didn't
have to be compatible with a hardware VT100 or TTY-33.
The problem, in general, isn't the system administrators.  If management
gave the same priority to security that it does to joining new users or
installing new hardware, sysadmins would have the time to install the
patches.  Most sysadmins are up to their asses in alligators.  Security is
something to put off.  If the managers were judged on the security of their
systems (perhaps via independent audit), then they might give the problem
some priority.

Absolutely.  However, from a vendor's point of view, customers have a wide
range of security problems.  Some run in an open environment and have no
use for security.  They may still be using those VT100s.  These are the
customers the vendor considers when thinking of backwards compatibility.
There are several "users" at issue.  I fully agree that those
administrators responsible for upgrading the software and hardware for the
change will notice.  The people who have to pay for it all should also
notice.  But the actual end user may find the logon simplified.  If is
sufficent to mearly identify the machine and not the person, then the new
software can eliminate end user involvement in the logon.  The
administrator is responsible for installing the private key in the machine
and the end user never sees it.
On the other hand, if users still must be identified, it is possible to
give them a logon interface which is unchanged from the old,
non-one-time-password, interface, while still giving them the benefits.

This comment about "annoyingly slow" key setup made me think of pipeline
hardware to set up the keys.  Now with blowfish, key setup requires running
the Blowfish algorithm 521 times in setting up the key, so the pipeline
will require 521 stages if you want a new key for every "real" decryption. Ignoring chip size restrictions, this pipeline will increase the chip real
estate by 521 which will have approximately the same economic effect on the
cost of cracks as extending the key by 9 bits.
For CBC cypher systems, brute force attacks will require at least two
decryptions (one for the initialization vector, and one for the first block
of the message).  however, these decryptions can take place in parallel
(for the first block of the message) so they do not change the above
argument.  However if the design calls for more than the first block, then
the pipeline can run slower and becomes a smaller portion of the cost of
the system.
Of course if you are using Blowfish with anywhere near its full 448 bit
key, brute force attacks are simply not practical.

to: are IRS employees more like corporate consultants or like soldiers.
(4) I think that if someone can be traced as profiting from a AP death,
e.g. through winning a gamble on the date/time of death, that person's
whereabouts at the time of death will be carefully investigated.
(5) While killing someone whose name and residence are known is easy, and
the killer is likely to get away with it, does that mean that killing
someone who has been marked as having a price on her head is as easy?  I

The bottom line of all cryptography is that there is something that must be
kept secret.  Since it must be kept secret, there is always a significant
level of paranoia about the means to keep the secret.  For example, one
could imagine an attacker attaching a logic analyzer to the CPU chip,
unloading the on-chip caches and then rummaging thru the system memory for
the secret.
One of the reasons classical (government) crypto users change keys
frequently is to minimize the amount of data compromised by a broken key. We keep hearing about NSA decrypting 20 year old cyphertext and showing
more of the workings of the atomic spy rings operating in the 40s and 50s. If an opponent can rubber hose the key, her job is easy.  If she has to
perform cryptoanalysis, it is much harder.  Remailers should regularly
change their keys to avoid compromising previously recorded traffic.  (They
can have a long lived key for signing their traffic keys.)

Precedence: bulk
Today in the House of Representatives, legislation was introduced to
encourage parental empowerment on the Internet and eliminate the vague and
overbroad "indecency" standard that became law under the Communications
Decency Act.
The new legislation, called the "Online Parental Control Act of 1996," was
introduced by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), whose district includes much of
California's Silicon Valley.  Representatives Pelosi (D-CA), Dellums
(D-CA), Farr (D-CA), Gejdenson (D-CT), and Woolsey (D-CA) are co-sponsors
of the bill.
(The full text of Rep. Eschoo's press release on the new legislation
follows below.)
The Online Parental Control Act of 1996 seeks to replace the "indecency"
standard (which is mainly used to regulate speech in BROADCAST media) with
the more narrowly-drawn "harmful to minors" standard which has already been
upheld as constitutional in 48 states.
My understanding is that "harmful to minors" is a PRINT-based standard, but
I'll research this and send out a more detailed evaluation as soon as
possible. In the meantime, I can say this: "harmful to minors" is viewed as
a middle-of-the-road standard, and as such, it remains *highly*
controversial. There are many who would argue that *any* attempt to
restrict access to content other than obscenity (which does not enjoy First
Amendment protection) is unwarranted.
Stay tuned.
All of this, by the way, comes on the heels of a bill (S 1567) Patrick
Leahy introduced in the United States Senate last month in an effort to
repeal the Communications Decency Act altogether.

Eshoo Introduces Online Parental Control Act
Legislation Strengthens Parental Control Of Online Materials,
Eliminates "Indecency" Standard
Washington, D.C.--Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) today introduced the Online
Parental Control Act of 1996 (OPCA) to strengthen the control parents
have over their children's access to online materials, eliminate the
"indecency" standard from the Communications Act of 1934, and provide
additional defenses against liability for publishing online materials.
Representatives Pelosi (D-CA), Dellums (D-CA), Farr (D-CA), Gejdenson
(D-CT), and Woolsey (D-CA) are original cosponsors of OPCA.
When the Telecommunications Reform Bill was signed into law earlier
this year, it made sweeping changes to America's telecommunications
policy.  Among those changes was the establishment of a ban on using
telecommunications devices to provide "indecent" materials to minors, as
well as defenses against being held liable for a violation of that ban.  For
example, people could avoid liability by using software that blocks the
access of minors to such materials or restricts access through the use
of credit card numbers or adult access codes.  Some U.S.
Representatives, including Rep. Eshoo, opposed the "indecency"
standard because the range of material it would ban was so broad that it
violates the right to freedom of speech.
The "indecency" standard is currently being challenged in court by a
large coalition of free speech advocacy groups and high technology
"The Online Parental Control Act will encourage an open dialogue in
Congress about the best way to both give parents control over what
their children see online and protect the First Amendment rights of
Internet users," said Rep. Eshoo.  "My proposal builds on last year's
efforts to reach a compromise on this issue by offering more incentives
for the online community to provide families with better parental control
"I'm supportive of efforts to address this issue in the courts, but I believe
Congress also needs to offer a legislative solution.  Given the political
realities of the current Congress, I think OPCA offers the most realistic
way to settle this dispute in a timely and effective manner."
The Online Parental Control Act of 1996:
        Replaces the "indecency" standard with a "harmful to minors"
        Establishes a definition for "harmful to minors;"
        Maintains the Communications Act of 1934's legal defenses
against liability for people who choose to give parents technology that: 1)
blocks or restricts access to online materials deemed obscene or harmful
to minors, and 2) restricts access to such materials through adult access
codes or credit card numbers;
        Adds two new defenses: 1) the use of labeling or segregating
systems to restrict access to online materials, such as systems
developed using the standards designed by the Platform for Internet
Content Selection project (PICS), and 2) the use of other systems that
serve the same function of the other defenses if they are as reasonable,
effective, and appropriate as blocking, adult access code, and labeling
technologies; and
        Protects providers or users of interactive computer services,
information content providers, and access software providers from civil
or criminal liability under state law for making available to minors materials
that are indecent or harmful to minors if they take actions to qualify for
the defenses mentioned above.
"I'd rather have Mom and Dad monitoring their children's online viewing
habits than the government," concluded Rep. Eshoo.  "Technology offers
the best opportunity for parents to manage what their kids have access
to, and the Online Parental Control Act encourages those technologies to
be developed more fully."
The "indecency" standard is a vague term that has been subject to legal
challenge by a wide range of free speech advocates and high
technology companies.  The broad nature of the "indecency" standard
means that it could lead to a prohibition on material such as classic art
like Michelangelo's David, classic literature like "Catcher In The Rye," and
frank discussions about birth control, sexuality, or disease transmission.
"Harmful to minors," on the other hand, already works successfully in 48
states, more directly addresses speech that actually harms children, and
passes constitutional muster.
PICS is a cross-industry working group assembled under the auspices of
MIT's World Wide Web Consortium to develop an easy-to-use content
labeling and selection platform that empowers people worldwide to
selectively control online content they receive through personal
computers.  The Recreational Software Advisory Council recently
announced that it will soon implement a detailed voluntary ratings system,
using PICS standards, that will let computer users filter out varying
degrees of sex, violence, nudity, and foul language.  Companies and
groups supporting PICS include Apple, America Online, AT&T, the Center
for Democracy and Technology, CompuServe, IBM, France Telecom,
Prodigy, Providence Systems/Parental Guidance, Surf Watch Software,
and Time Warner Pathfinder.

How they did it (from A word about the VENONA cryptosystems---they should have been impossible to
read. They consisted of a code book in which letters, words, and phrases
were equated to numbers. So a code clerk would take a plain text message
and encode the message using numbers from the codebook. This would have
presented a significant challenge itself depending on how long the code
book was used. However, the messages were further modified, in other words
double-encrypted, by use of a one time pad. The use of a one time pad
effectively randomizes the code and renders it unreadable. The key to the
VENONA success was that mistakes were made in the construction and use of
the one time pads---a fact that was discovered only through brute force and
analysis of the message traffic. ... One-time pads used properly only once are unbreakable; however, the
KGB's cryptographic material manufacturing center in the Soviet Union
apparently reused some of the pages from one-time pads. This provided
Arlington Hall with an opening. Very few of the 1942 KGB messages were able
to be solved because there was very little duplication of one-time pad
pages in those messages. The situation was more favorable in 1943, even
more so in 1944, and the success rate improved accordingly.

"There is a growing concern that the very existence of the Internet is
a threat to the nation-state" (Globe and Mail, Feb 3/96, p. A1).
Recently, the headline "Nations see Internet as threat to security"
appeared on the front page of Canada's national daily newspaper, The
Globe and Mail. Consider for a moment that more than two decades after
its "invention" and three years after its integration into popular
culture and the business process, the Internet has distinguished
itself on two fronts. It remains the only mass media system to escape
monopolistic ownership by media conglomerates (with no sign of this
changing) and it is increasingly seen, correctly, as a threat to
national security and sovereignty. Meanwhile, the business community
throughout the world is gradually integrating the Internet into the
core of its communication and marketing infrastructure. The inevitable
outcome of these trends is that the communication infrastructure
(including marketing, customer service, and financial transactions) of
the business community is destined to conflict with the information
policies of governments. One way of looking at the Internet is to
understand it as an emerging nation-state, a state that, with each
passing day, becomes more entwined with the fabric of the geo-
political balance of power. The corporate world, particularly
multinational corporations, and governments are soon going to have to
come to terms with the statehood of the Internet.
Political theorist Anthony Giddons writes that "significant power,
within any type of organization, consists in the capacity to determine
or shape policy." This understanding of power -- policy making -- is
one that any manager, executive, or bureaucrat can certainly
appreciate. Power-as-policy-making sheds light on the type of power
the Net, (and more comprehensively, cyberspace,) wields. More
precisely, the statehood of the Net is founded on its power to deny
existing nations any concrete method to exercise direct, unilateral
influence over the "policy" of the Internet. It is quite clear that, congressional saber-rattling aside, no nation
has successfully legislated the information policy of the Internet. As
a landless nation-state, the Net's constitution, or bill of rights, is
its internal information policy -- no one group, community, ideology
or nation is universally recognized to have the right to determine
what values, art forms, beliefs, or private thoughts can or cannot be
expressed on the Net. While this information policy is framed by pre-
existing international treaties concerning copyright, thus far this
unwritten but very real policy has not been further defined or amended
by any individual nation's internal moral standards or legislature.
Bear in mind that no significant content has ever been removed from
the Net as a result of any one nation's information-policy making
process. Indeed, just the opposite is the case -- every attempt at
censoring content on the Net has lead to increased exposure of the
censored or banned content and its further proliferation throughout
the Net. Admittedly, it is theoretically possible for a government to censor
material on Internet servers within its borders. Yet all previous
attempts at doing so have simply resulted in the censored material
migrating to the Net servers of other nations and remaining accessible
via the Net to all. The dynamic of regional censorship being
undermined by the international Net community is now almost a daily
occurrence. This "end of censorship" in the international information
sphere is not threatened by the possibility of a global information
policy trade agreement on censorship. Any attempt to impose the
freedom of speech standards of one nation on another will certainly be
interpreted as a violation of national sovereignty.
As a new form of borderless state, Cspace (Internet/cyberspace) has
demonstrated sovereign power over its internal information policy. The
front pages of newspapers around the world are demonstrating a growing
awareness of this new political animal. But neither the global body
politic nor the corporate realm have come to terms with the extent of
the Net's sovereignty and the future impact of this "new wired world
order". For the complete text of this essay, send the command GET POLITICS in

I would agree with you, except I started International Caving.  When in

worry, he speaks good German."  Fortunatly, my German was good enough.
While in China as a normal tourist, a travel agency in Yichang tried to

The phone companies have dealt with this kind of problem for years.  For
example, there are issues of phase jitter and bit error rate that they deal
with all the time.  If anything, they don't quite understand the email type
communication of, "Oh, anytime in the next 10 minutes, and tell me if it
doesn't get thru and I'll send it again."
In ATM, these characteristics are bundled into what is called Quality of
Service.  That, along with bandwidth, make a reasonable basis for charging.
 Email is a bit like flying standby, while video is more like the Concorde.
 IMHO, the only long-term solution to the problem of bandwidth allocation
involves markets.  Markets feed cost information back to the users and give
the providers incentive to improve service.

As far as I know, DES is DES, domestic or export.  If your DES
interoperates with domestic DES (or popular implementations available on
non-US servers), then you have DES.
It is THE standard.  The political reasons are complex, but the bottom line
is that large governments and other large organizations can brute force 56
bit keys.  As far as the US government and the US banking system are
concerned, this ability does not reduce bank transaction security since the
US government can get the details directly from the bank by legal process.
Most cryptographic experts recommend Triple DES, encrypting the data 3
times with 3 different keys.  If the middle encryption runs DES in decrypt
mode, the system can be made compatible with single DES by using the same
key 3 times.  The US government has never, to my knowledge, licensed the
export of a Triple DES system.

Since SET is very careful to not deal with anything but the financial
aspects of online commerce, they can probably get a license for export
under the current rules.  (SET only includes a SHA hash of the "contract",
calculated by both the cardholder and the merchant in its encrypted

Since I am basically conservative (small c, original meaning), I always

to the best of the private schools, and the bottom 10% are cesspools.  We
should start by issuing education vouchers to the parents of students in
the bottom 10% of the schools for the state aid their districts would have
otherwise gotten.  We can monitor indicators such as the juvenile crime
rate and standardized tests to see how the experiment is progressing.
If the experiment is wildly successful, it will be extended quickly by
popular demand.  If it is mildly successful, it should be extended to more
schools, but more slowly (perhaps the lowest 25% next), and monitored.  In
any case, when it reaches the top 10%, it ain't broke, schools, they will

I find it remarkable they were that open.
They had a technique which helped them with 1.  They didn't want to reveal
it or foreign systems would be changed hurting NSA's pursuit of 1.  They
had a (small, DES was public and therefore could be used by foreigners)
obligation thru 2 to help with DES.  They honored 3 by saying as little as
possible, while still strengthening DES.
If they were cypherpunks, or academic cryptologists I would agree. However, their responsibilities do not involve publishing, so I can't fault
the way they skated thru the maze of conflicting responsibilities given
what we know.  I can not fault them for following their charter.  (Faulting
their charter is a different matter.)
When designing crypto systems, it is worthwhile to consider NSA as the
opponent, because as far as I know, they are the best there is.  If your
system is secure from NSA, then it is secure from everyone except insiders.
 However the government always skates between the horns of the dilemma that
acting on the results of NSA intercepts may cause their opponents the
change their crypto systems, cutting off the intercepts.
This logic says the government can always act on the results of 40 bit key
intercepts because everyone knows they are insecure.  If they acted on a 56
bit key intercept, it would make concrete what we already know
theoretically.  If they acted on a 96 bit key intercept, people would
abandon the underlying crypto system because of the unfeasibility of brute
forcing a 96 bit key.  (When considering what to abandon, the random
process used to generate the 96 bits should be at least as suspect as the

John Gilmore wrote an excellent description of GAK 3 (aka Clipper III, aka
Enabling Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public Safety in the Global
Information Infrastructure).  Here are a couple of other points that even
the proponents of this scheme should agree to:
(1) GAK3 does not provide for the significant public purpose of protecting
dissident groups under repressive regimes.  Human rights groups in
Bosina/Serbia have used PGP to protect their files.  Since their computers
have been frequently seized, the only protection for those people who have
made human rights complaints has been that the local government has not had
access to the keys.
(2) The paper fails to differentiate between the needs of communication
privacy and data storage privacy.  No rational person would want to GAK
their communication keys.  Data lost because keys are lost can always be
retransmitted.  Since communications are easy to intercept, having a long
term GAK key greatly increases the chances that the long term key will be
stolen and the session keys intercepted.  Communication session keys should
be decided by techniques such as Diffie Hellman which ensure that the only
entities with access to the key are the programs/hardware at each end of
the link.
A better case for escrowing long term data storage keys can be made. Physical security provides some protection for the cyphertext.  Loss of a
key can mean loss of the data.  However, it is not clear why encrypting for
data storage is any different from storing confidential data in a safe.  If
the government has a legitimate need to access the data, they can access it
through the same legal processes they use to access data in safes.  While
long term data storage can use escrow agents, it does not need GAK for any
legal public purpose.

@_subject: Runtime info flow in Java 
Let me take a couple of stabs at this question.
A lot of the answer depends on what you mean by secure.  For example, if
the Java run-time can successfully contain Java applets so they can't
access any of the unsecured portions of your OS, then it doesn't matter
that those OS holes exist as far as protection from the applets is
concerned.  The proof that the Java run-time actually can do this
containment is left as an exercise for the student :-).
Capabilities could be used to give specific Java applets access to specific
resources on your computer system.  e.g. You could give an applet the
capability to read a file.  In the Java world it would appear as an object
with only one method (read).  The specific applet object instances which
had access to that object could read the file.  Others could not.
A slightly different view of where capabilities might fit in is on a
network of mutually suspicious actors (e.g. the global Internet).  Start by
assuming that each machine is strongly resistant to attack through the
network.  (Ironically, Mac/Wintel platforms may be easier to secure in this
manner than Unix platforms because they have fewer of the compromised
network daemons running.  Firewalls already allow Unix networks to approach
this level of security.)  In this model, you must either trust or contain
all the code you run on your machine.
We can use certificates (ref: SPKI) to implement network capabilities. These certificates make statements of the form: The holder of the secret
key which corresponds to this public key is permitted these specific forms
of access to this specific resource on this location (e.g. a URL).  These
certificates can act like capabilities.  They can be passed by creating a
new certificate for the receiver which gives it the privileges implied by
the old certificate.  They can be rescinded in any of a number of ways.
Capability certificates allow you to give access to specific resources on
your machine with public key authentication to prevent spoofing.  Because
they support one or more techniques for the holder to pass the capability
to others, they allow subcontracting computation to other machines in the
I will note in passing that ACLs do not allow for subcontracting.

Sounds like a good way to me.  When you want to pass a capability, you can

The brute force system decrypts the first, and second blocks (8 bytes each)

the comparison is equal it has the key.
If we eliminated the header and just started with the compressed data, then
the brute force system would have to decrypt and decompress enough of the

(1) John has not censored Dr. Vulis.  He is still free to speak to
cypherpunks by posting in the normal manner.
(2) John as not turned to the courts as some others have suggested. Turning to the courts would certainly not be the way a cryptoanarchist

The best paradigm I can come up with to analyze John's action is my quite
imperfect understanding of communitarian theory.  In essence,
communitarians say that there should be a level of social control between
individual rights and the forceful coercion of the state.  What John has
done is step forward and excommunicate Dr. Vulis.  He has said to Dr.
Vulis, "You are no longer a member of the cypherpunks community."

accurate (but probably not unless they can decode the selective

In either case, the Passenger Name Records for the flight are in the
airlines databases (and have been there for many years), and the airplane's

I generally agree with Tim about consumers.  However, I remember working on

a woman discussing (presumably with a girlfriend) her boyfriend and their
sex life over a portable telephone.  You can bet that every available

Where I think there is a market and an awareness of a need is in the

companies is how much the facility costs.  (I recently heard a price of

Adaptive-chosen-plaintext: Unbreakable, ditto

Purchase-key:      This attack seems the only way to break an OTP.
If you accept Purchase-key as a valid attack, and it certainly has worked
in many real-life situations, then no system is "unbreakable" and there is
not any point in using the term.  If you leave it out of the valid forms of
attack, because all systems are vulnerable to it so it doesn't help in
selecting a cryptosystem, then the OTP is "unbreakable".

The notion of {\it non-malleable} cryptography,
an extension of semantically secure cryptography,
will be defined.
Informally, in the context of encryption
the additional requirement is that
given the ciphertext it is impossible to generate
a {\it different} ciphertext so that the respective
plaintexts are related.
Common public key cryptosystems are quite malleable:
for example, in RSA it is trivial to compute
$E(2x)$ given only $E(x)$.
Although defined with public key cryptography in mind,
non-malleability issues also arise in private-key cryptography.
Indeed, the security of
many common protocols, such as Kerberos, relies
implicitly on the inability of an adversary to compute $E(f(N))$
given only $E(N)$, for simple functions $f$.
The talk will focus on non-malleable public key cryptosystems.
with a few remarks on non-malleable schemes for
private-key cryptography, string commitment,
and proofs of possession of knowledge.

The problem is you are misusing the term One Time Pad.
One of the criteria for a OTP is that you can credibly claim that ANY plain
text (of the correct length) is a valid decryption of a cyphertext
encrypted with a OTP.  Since your PRNG has less entropy than the message,
there are output sequences that can not occur.  Therefore there are
plaintext messages which have no possible key.  These messages are not
credible decryptions and the PRNG is not a OTP.  This criterion is directly
related to the provable security of the OTP.  As such it is certainly a
rationally established criterion.
Now your PRNG may be a reasonably secure cypher system.  (I haven't looked
at it.)  However it isn't an OTP and should not be advertised as such. Doing so makes people familar with the field think you don't know what you

When you build RSA keys in PGP it uses keyboard timings to acquire "true
randomness" or entropy.  This kind of randomness is related to quantum
mechanical uncertainty.  It probably has enough entropy to safely generate
RSA keys by the keyboard technique it uses.
In addition to RSA keys, it generates symmetric IDEA keys whenever you send
a message.  It uses keystrokes accumulated during normal operation and
saved in a file called randpool (or something like that) to generate these
keys.  Since you almost never enter keystrokes during the normal operation
of MacPGP, I am concerned that randpool does not have enough entropy.
Entropy Manager is a program Jon Callas of Apple is working on.  It uses
well-known sources of entropy in the computer to build up a pool of entropy
for use by programs that need it.  The last I heard, it was nearly ready. I would trust it more than the ported PGP since Jon has examined sources
available in the Macintosh specifically.

To paraphrase John Von Neumann, any system which uses reply blocks is in a
state of sin.  By this I mean that if there is a chain pointing at you, a
sufficiently powerful attacker can walk down that chain and find you.
Given that, I will join the state of sin by proposing a mechanism which
will allow Alice to receive a reply from Bob, but change her mind at any
time.  The basic idea is to have a one-time reply block which either Bob or
Alice can send to.  If Alice thinks that too much time has elapsed, and
powerful enemies are walking down her reply block chain, she can send
herself a reply and break the chain.  (She might send a reply thru each
link in the chain to break all the links.)
It also occurs to me that since email addresses are about the same size as
secure symmetric keys, it would be attractive to use real one time pads
instead of symmetric key cyphers for encrypting them.

I was thinking of storing a reply-key in each remailer.  The protocol might
go something like this (straw man proposal):
(1) Alice picks n random ids (say 160 bits or so) and n random keys.
(2) Alice sends the combination  to remailer[i], i=0,n-1.
(3) Alice builds a reply block which consists of the remailer return path,
each element encyphered with the appropriate key and sends it to Bob.
(4) When a remailer processes a reply block element, it removes it from the
reply block, looks up the id in its database, decrypts the address of the
next hop, removes the database element and forwards the message.
If Alice becomes nervous, she sends n "replys" thru each remailer to cause
the return path to be destroyed.

You certainly know the details of Mixmaster remailers better than I do.  In
a last defense, while the protocol requires Alice's program to do a lot of
work, it still could be fairly easy for Alice herself to use.  In addition,
the remailer could set a definite limit to the lifetime of the keys, since
Alice is also setting such a limit.  If Alice specifies their lifetime when
she sends them, then the path would automatically dissolve without action
on her part.
Let me float one more hair-brained idea.  I think Tim May is right in
saying that the most secure response technique is the one in Blacknet. i.e. The response are posted to some public bulletin board, and then Alice
reads them at her leisure.
I see two problems with this approach:  (1) It doesn't scale well, and (2)
Alice's reading of the response may be detected.  (I think of the vans in
Great Britain which listen to the local oscillator frequency of TV sets to
find what people are watching.)
Perhaps both of these problems could be solved by something like a stock
photo service which uses digital watermarks to discourage copyright
infringement.  Since it is using digital watermarks, each copy of a
particular photo would be different, providing the opportunity to stego an
encrypted message in the photo.  If Alice regularly spent $.05 of Ecash for
a new desktop background photo, it would be hard to determine which had
stegoed messages.  The service might even make money on just the
above-board sales.

Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory" in The Sixth USENIX Security

general interest I am posting the answer and Bccing the original
The paper starts with the comment that most secure data destruction guides
are classified.  There is the suspicion that the unclassified ones do not
cover the newer recording materials and techniques, and will not protect
you against government attackers.
The analysis techniques for disks examined were Magnetic Force Microscopy
(MFM) and its close cousin, Magnetic Force Scanning Tunneling Microscopy
(STM).  "It is possible to build a reasonably capable SPM for about
US$1400, using a PC as a controller." (See
  This cost is
conceivably within the range of a high school student.
Peter discusses the way that data can be recovered from under new data (due
to the difference in the magnetic domains depending on whether the bits
were the same or different), and beside new data due to positioning errors
of the head.
When trying to develop a secure erasure technique, you need to know the
encoding technique used on the disk.  (e.g. FM, MFM, RLL, PRML etc.)
He recommends a 35 pass erasure scheme as follows:
1-4     Random
5       0x55
6       0xAA
7       0x924924
8       0x492492
9       0x249249
10      0x00
11      0x11
12      0x22
13      0x33
14      0x44
15      0x55
16      0x66
17      0x77
18      0x88

28      0x249249
29      0x6DB6DB
30      0xB6DB6D
31      0xDB6DB6
32-35   Random
He recommends using cryptographically random numbers and randomly permuting
the deterministic passes to further confuse attackers.
He warns about disabling any disk caches which may be present, and
discusses the problems of erasing data on now-bad sectors.  He points out
that data which has been left for a long time is harder to erase than
recently written data.  He mentions that the most powerful commercially
available deguassers aren't powerful enough to erase modern disks or DAT
tapes.  (N.B. Deguassing a disk will also erase the factory-written control
tracks, making the disk useless.)  He notes that ECC may make destruction
of data more difficult.
He recommends burning floppy disks.
He also discusses recovering data from DRAM and SRAM devices.  He mentions
that data which has been stored in DRAM for 10 minutes will be detectable
after power is removed.  He recommends that sensitive data (such as crypto
keys) have their bits flipped every second or so.  This technique has the
beneficial side effect that the page remains recently used and is less
likely to be paged out.\
I quote from his conclusion, "Data overwritten once or twice may be
recovered by subtracting what is expected to be read from a storage
location from what is actually read.  Data which is overwritten an
arbitrarily large number of times can still be recovered provided that the
new data isn't written to the same location as the original data (for
magnetic media), or that the recovery attempt is carried out fairly soon
after the new data was written (for RAM).  For this reason it is
effectively impossible to sanitize storage locations by simple overwriting
them, no matter how many overwrite passes are made or what data patterns
are written.  However by using the relatively simple methods presented in
this paper the task of an attacker can be made significantly more
difficult, if no prohibitively expensive."

@_subject: Gaining trust in OCO crypto code 
These thoughts came up at the Mac Crypto conference, but are somewhat more
general than the Macintosh, so I am ccing them to cypherpunks.
OCO, or Object Code Only, a bad idea whose time has not yet past (although
it was part of the reason for the decline of IBM's mainframe operating
systems), is the business practice of keeping the source code for a system
secret.  Some companies are applying the idea to cryptographic software, so
the we should think about how we can establish trust in such software.
There are three techniques which may work for all OCO software.
(1) Trust the designer/implementor.  Ron Rivest's RC2 and RC4 algorithms
were originally released as OCO algorithms.  Rivest's reputation as a
cryptographer established trust in them.
(2) Trust a third party auditing agency.  The US military trusts vendor
implementations of cryptographic software because they have been audited by
the NSA.
(3) Reverse engineer the implementation.  While laborious, this process is
straight forward.  When Netscape started using RC4 in their SSL
implementation, a review of its security became important enough that a
certain anonymous person(s) reverse engineered the implementation and
posted it to the Internet.  As a result, the algorithm has undergone peer
If we can't use the above techniques, we have to think very carefully about
what parts of a cryptographic system we can trust by only examining their
inputs and outputs.  Here is a list of things we can NOT trust in this
(1) Random number generation.  An error (as occurred in a Netscape
implementation), or a deliberate weakness can not be easily detected by
examining only the output of a cryptographic random number generator.
(2) Key generation.  There are published ways to encode an RSA secret key
in the corresponding RSA public key.  A key generation algorithm which only
uses 32 bits of the random number would be hard to detect, but easy to
break by one who knew its secret.  You have to be able to examine in detail
how keys are generated.
Now there are some things we might be able to trust based only on an
examination of the inputs and outputs.
(1) Implementation of a cryptographic algorithm.  If we can feed it enough
test cases, and compare the output with a public, well vetted
implementation, we can come to believe that it is correct.
(2) Certain cryptographic protocols.  If we can trust one side of a
Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange, then we can trust the keys generated
because both sides contribute to the randomness of those keys.  However we
can't trust two instances of an OCO DH exchange implementation working with
each other, so this trust doesn't seem to cover many practical instances.
If the OCO protocol implementation can interoperate with a trusted
implementation, then we can start to have some trust in it.  However, we
will still have to carefully examine the protocol for covert channels. This form of trust may be of real-world use.

What I find most ironic about the whole Government/Microsoft thing it the
role the government had in helping Microsoft achieve its current market
position.  Early in the days of the IBM/PC, the government, along with many
major corporations, decided that the only desk top computers they bought
would be PCs.  There were many arguments about how they would save money by
having only one kind of system to support, and how by having multiple
suppliers, they would be able to buy hardware at competitive prices.
Well, one for two isn't bad.  The hardware is competitively priced.
However, the support costs are probably higher than competing systems (e.g.
What was left out of the analysis was the cost of the software.  The OS is
considerably more expensive than e.g. Linux.  (And it is a hidden cost,
bundled in with the hardware cost.)  Then there is the cost of being held
by the balls by a single company.
Now the government could rectify some of the damage they helped cause by
doing the same thing any other computer purchaser can do.  Specify
non-Microsoft products.  Require special internal justification to purchase
a Microsoft product.  Require all systems to use open (e.g. IETF)
standards.  Ensure that there are several viable suppliers in all phases of
the market by buying from all of them.  Instead, they try to hobble
I must admit to a guilty pleasure.  It couldn't happen to two nicer
organizations.  The Department of Justice and Microsoft.  It's almost the

the ointment is that I am paying for one side of this war.

@_subject: Hardening lists against spam attacks 
There seems to some confusion about what I actually proposed.  (I never
seem to be able to write clearly the first time.)  Let me describe in more
detail my currently preferred token distribution system.
First some definitions:
  Majordomo - The rule based administrator for the list
  List administrator - The rule maker.  Also does the things majordomo can't.
  poster - someone who wants to post a message to the list
  list member - those who receive the list.
Token distribution works like this:  A poster desiring a token sends a
request to majordomo and includes a public key.  This request can be sent
thru a remailer chain.  Majordomo generates a token (think of it as a
secret key), encyphers it with the public key, and posts it to the list.
Note that the poster does not have to be subscribed to the list.  The token
can be recovered from the archives or from a reflector list.  (Thanks to
Tim May for the suggestion of this method of distribution.)
Now we have given poster an anonymous token.  Since tokens are good
forever, true anonymity requires a new token for each post.  Otherwise the
poster only has a pseudonym.  I consider this feature an advantage.
Since tokens are good forever, majordomo will only give out a limited
number per day.  I suggest four.  This limit will somewhat protect against
the attack Ray Arachelian pointed out of having one abusive user collect
10,000,000 tokens.
It is important to recognize the class of problems I am trying to solve.
While I would like to solve the sporadic "make money fast" spam problem, I
agree with Tim that, at today's levels, it is only an annoyance.  I also
agree that the drivel that comes from some of our more prolific posters is
best handled by filtering by the list members themselves.  (I currently
have 3 of them going directly to the trash.  Perhaps aga should get
kickbacks from Qualcomm.  He managed to sell a copy of EudoraPro.)
The problem I am really concerned with is denial of service attacks via
flooding.  With 1000 list members, each message to the list requires a lot
of resources to handle compared with the ones it requires to send.  This
fact gives an attacker a bit advantage.  Tokens are designed to enable
majordomo to recognize the source of messages and provide lower performance
reception to those who are sending a lot of messages.  This technique is
similar to the technique used by the Whitehouse mail system to limit
flooding attacks.  (And the idea came from a description of that system
posted here some months ago.)
Tokens would also give the list administrator a tool to discourage certain
posters.  If John Gillmore wanted to make it hard for Dimitri to post, he
could cancel Dimitri's token.  Dimitri could get another one (under a
different name if Majordomo's instructions prevented it from giving him
one), but John could continue the cancel the new ones.  (N.B. There is no
evidence that John actually wanted to keep Dimitri from posting.  This
example is only a hypothetical.)
Sandy suggests gateways (i.e. distributed moderators) to preserve
anonymity.  While I don't think they are needed to preserve anonymity, they
will be useful for those who can't or won't encrypt their posts.  It is
important to note here that anyone with a token can act as a gateway.
I was trying to make only small changes in the dynamics of the list.  As
such, the market based solutions are more radical than I was willing to
consider.  I would like to see a market based system in actual use, but
perhaps elsewhere.  The idea seems better fitted to Robert Hettinga's e$pam

@_subject: Hardening lists against spam attacks 
I guess from reading Scott McGuire's message I should have described the
posting procedure as well as the token issuing procedure.  Here is what you
do to post:
Poster writes the post and include the token in the required place
(wherever that turns out to be).  Poster encrypt the message with the
list's secret key and sends it to the list.  Majordomo decrypts the
message, checks the token, and if the token check passes, sends the
plaintext of the message to the list members.
Important points:
(1) You do not need a secret key to post.  This feature allows you to post
from machines where you don't want to store your secret key ring.
(2) List members do not need PGP, only posters.
(3) People who want to post who can't due to local policy (e.g. no PGP)
have choices:
 (a) Get a real ISP and machine and become a first class citizen.
 (b) Send the post to someone who can post via private mail, explain
     the situation and ask to have it posted.
The principle reason for using PGP for posting is to protect the token from
theft.  I don't know a single-message, one-way protocol where a person can
show possession of a token without reveling it.  If there is such a
protocol, then PGP is no longer required.

all the people who read it will go elsewhere.  In the recent past, they
have subscribed it to other high-volume mailing lists, and given its

Perhaps these people already feel they are being treated unfairly by the
management of the unmoderated list.
These people will be perfectly happy to forge the names of preapproved

@_subject: Server Authentication 
I recently came aware of an interesting problem in server authentication.
I.e. How does a browser plugin validate the server it is working for.
There are many reasons for a plugin to want to validate its web server
including contractual relations, but the one that most appeals to me is
that the plugin provides access to confidential data which is used in an
application distributed between the client machine and the server.  Since
the data is confidential, the plugin doesn't want to send it to just any
server who can serve up a web page in the correct format, so it needs to
authenticate the server.
Now the obvious way to validate the server would be through the
certificates exchanged when the SSL session was set up.  (I am assuming a
SSL session here because you shouldn't send confidential data over a
non-encrypted link.)  However, I haven't found an API where the plugin can
discover the certificate used by the server, so it appears you have to roll
your own.
Rolling your own seems to come up against the problem mentioned by the
IPSEC people, i.e. if you separate authentication and encryption the places
you can end up are:
(1) Encrypted and authenticated.
(2) Encrypted but not authenticated.
(3) Not encrypted and subject to a man in the middle authentication attack.
(i.e. If an IP router can route your authentication packets, so can one
running Mallory's special code.  In the case above, the hostile server acts
as a router for authentication.)
(4) Unauthenticated and unencrypted.
Does anyone have a solution to this authentication problem?
Are signed applets discriminating enough to differentiate between different
validated hosts and adjust local permissions differently (at the file level
at least) for each?  (Or is it more like, "Oh this applet is from
marketspam.com which is signed by the US Post Office, it can read or write
anything on the machine."  Yea, right :-( )

As far as I can tell, law, custom, and technology are the three ways we
have to protect our privacy.  Cypherpunks are well aware of the
technological options, so I won't discuss them further except to note that
they probably are not, by themselves, enough.
Law has also been discussed, including the European privacy laws and
similar laws which have been proposed for the US.  One good thing about the
European mindset on privacy is that it seems to include resistance to legal
suppression of privacy technology.
The last is custom.  This approach appears in cypherpunk discussions as an
emphasis on contractual relations between people and the organizations
receiving data.  It is this area I would like to discuss.
What makes a good privacy contract?  What should you expect when you buy
something?  What is the standard contract?  What exceptions must be clearly
noted?  How does society decide these cultural issues?
I strongly believe in standard contracts because they greatly reduce
transaction costs.  Where the parties need different terms, they can
negotiate exceptions.  However, we do not have standard privacy contracts
which match our new communication and database technologies.  We don't even
have a good public debate on the issues involved.
Unfortunately, it seems that the only way to raise these issues to the
radar scope of the news media/public is to have some congresscritter
propose a law.  Even more unfortunately, said law usually preempts people's
right to contract with each other, rather than just setting a framework for
the contract negotiations.  There must be a better way.

It is this kind of attitude I wish to encourage thru custom, certainly not law.
When I was in Malasia, I saw signs in many stores which said in effect, In
accordance with Islamic law, we offer fair prices.  My experience with
prices in stores with these signs is that they were lower than in some of
the other stores.
A similar approach could evolve for network sites.  A sign saying that we
follow the US Chamber of Commerce's code on fair information practices
could easily evolve.  My questions are, what should that code contain?
And, how many different codes do we need?

@_subject: Fw: Cops, Spies Fail to Slow Crypto Bill 
I can't resist.  "When crypto is outlawed, only outlaws will have crypto."
However, in the case of crypto, essentially all terrorists, child
pornographers, big-time drug dealers, and big-time money launderers will
have and use it.
To try to redeem myself for yielding to temptation let me offer the
following scenario:
It is sometime in the year 2002.  The GAK crowd has achieved its wildest
wet dream, and all development of non-GAKed crypto stopped in 1998.  All
the standard computer software uses GAKed crypto.
Let us further assume that US Airframes Inc. (USAI) is in heavy competition
with French Wings Inc. to build the next generation of passenger airplanes.
The competition is so heavy that the respective governments are doing all
they can to provide under-the-table help to their national champions.  This
certainly includes playing the GAK card and decrypting every communication
they can get their hands on.
Now assume you are the security manager of USAI.  Your job is to ensure the
confidentiality of communications between your branch offices and
headquarters in the US.  You get (perhaps from someone who enjoys child
pornography) a copy of PGP which was saved on some forgotten CDROM backup
dating from 1997.  You share your copy with headquarters and the branch
offices, generate key pairs, and validate their MD5 hashes through some
offline protocol.  Now all really sensitive traffic is encrypted with PGP
and then sent through the standard GAK crypto.
Now consider the problem of the French Government.  The only way they can
know you are using illegal crypto is to decrypt the GAKed outer layer.  If
they arrest you for using illegal crypto, they have blown their covert
monitoring.  The US government will make a big international incident about
this misuse of GAK and impose a special tariff on French wine.  If the
French keep quiet, you can continue to use PGP.
This is the classic dilemma of covert decryption.  Kahn describes is well
in "The Code Breakers".  It also applies to the four horsemen.  If the
government arrests someone for illegal crypto, the whole organization knows
that part of the operation has attracted government attention, and can
change their communications and/or have those people take a vacation to
cool off.

There is also a namespace collapse problem in China.  They have a
patrilineal family naming convention much like the one that is common in
the USA.  However the naming system has been stable for thousands of years.
In that time, some names have died out (only girl babies).  They somewhat
avoid the associated namespace collision problem by being imaginative with
given names.
To avoid namespace collapse, you need to continually introduce new names.
If Iceland didn't limit given names, the problem would go away.  For
example: I know a Catnip Echoridge Fredrick.  I bet Catnipsson would expand

track record when used against civilized countries.  (I wouldn't recommend

Probably because there wasn't much domestic support for our staying there.
The same comment applies to the British leaving Palestine.  IMHO, the

Can you say regulatory arbitrage?  The current social controls on spam are
good enough that no one with any positive reputation wants to have anything
to do with it.  This means that spammers have to use anonymous offshore
answering services.  The widespread hatred of spam and spammers should keep
the total amount under control without the legal action and in spite of the
very low cost of spamming.
The recent problems Spamford has been having with denial of service attacks
is just one example of the social control process.  The flood of hostile

More generally, if you haven't set foot on the land, and your father never
set foot on the land, and so on, then trade and perhaps even friendship
with whoever currently is on the land may be a better deal than poverty,
blood, and death.  YMMV, however you should not let religion/ideology/hate
blind you to your long term rational self interest.
I do agree with Tim that some things are worth fighting and even dieing
for, but they should always be examined in terms of long term rational self

you to make a proper escort into paradise.  If the nazi-commies are
enslaving your country, then by all means take up arms in its defense.
IMHO, in northern Ireland and Palestine/Israel all the continued fighting
promises is poverty, blood, and death.  Accepting that possession is 100%

IMHO - What you are really signing is the binding between the data

saying that the secret key holder is (one of the) person(s) who has access
to that account, and not some man in the middle in the middle.  If you ask

My answer was a pure SPKI answer.  As a first approximation, in SPKI your
identity is your key.  Meatspace doesn't enter into it at all.  This avoids
the naming problem of meatspace (i.e. Which John Smith).
Much of the problem with PGP key signing is there is no complete agreement
on what it means.  I chose to have it mean that there verification of the
binding between the data associated with the key and the key.
If you have a version of the key with no signatures, then you can change
the data field and re-sign with the associated secret key.  Since the data
field has changed, you properly need to have others re-verify the validity
of the binding.

I believe that the person who made this statement shares the standard
cyperpunk definition of "strong crypto".  I.e. Unbreakable before the heat
death of the universe.
IMHO, this view comes from the fact that most foreign government and
international terrorist communication is already strongly encrypted, so
having strong systems in wider use does very little to reduce NSA's
intelligence gathering abilities.  (See "Secret Power, New Zealand's role
in the international spy network" by Nicky Hager for evidence supporting
this view.)  Since part of NSA's job is to defend the USA against foreign
enemies, this faction has decided that the benefits of widespread strong
crypto outweigh the costs, a very cypherpunk view.
To go even further out on a limb, there may be a NSA faction that worries
about the inevitable weakness that GAK inserts in any crypto system.  NSA
was badly burned by the weaknesses in Clipper.
I am speaking of a faction within NSA.  They may represent the agencies
position and have been shot down by the White House, or they may have lost

I think this comment is in error.  Plutonium has a half life on the order
of 250,000 years, so very little decay products would build up in 6 years.
The tritium used in thermonuclear weapons has a much shorter half life, and
would need to be replaced about that often.

Bill Of No Rights
The following was written by State Representative Mitchell Kaye from
Cobb County, GA
We, the sensible people of the United States, in an attempt to help
everyone get along, restore some semblance of justice, avoid any more
riots, keep our nation safe, promote positive behavior and secure the
blessings of debt-free liberty to ourselves and our great-great-great
grandchildren, hereby try one more time to ordain and establish some
common sense guidelines for the terminally whiny,  guilt-ridden
delusional and other liberal, commie, pinko bedwetters.  We hold these
truths to be self-evident, that a whole lot of people were confused by
the Bill of Rights and are so dim that they require a Bill of No
ARTICLE I: You do not have the right to a new car, big screen TV or any
other form of wealth. More power to you if you can legally acquire them,
but no one is guaranteeing anything.
ARTICLE II: You do not have the right to never be offended. This country
is based on freedom, and that means freedom for everyone - not just you!
You may leave the room, turn the channel, express a different opinion,
etc., but the World is full of idiots, and probably always will be.
ARTICLE III: You do not have the right to be free from harm. If you
stick a screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more careful, do not expect
the tool manufacturer to make you and all your relatives independently
ARTICLE IV: You do not have the right to free food and housing.
Americans are the most charitable people to be found, and will gladly
help anyone in need, but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing
generation after generation of professional couch potatoes who achieve
nothing more than the creation of another generation of professional
couch potatoes.
ARTICLE V: You do not have the right to free health care. That would be
nice, but from the looks of public housing, we're just not interested in
health care.
ARTICLE VI: You do not have the right to physically harm other people.
If  you kidnap, rape, intentionally maim or kill someone, don't be
surprised if the rest of us want to see you fry in the electric chair.
ARTICLE VII: You do not have the right to the possessions of others.  If
you rob, cheat or coerce away the goods or services of other citizens,
don't be surprised if the rest of us get together and lock you away in a
place where you still won't have the right to a big-screen color TV or a
life of leisure.
ARTICLE VII: You don't have the right to demand that our children risk
their lives in foreign wars to soothe your aching conscience. We hate
oppressive governments and won't lift a finger to stop you from going to
fight if  you'd like. However, we do not enjoy parenting the entire world
and do not want to spend so much of our time battling each and every
little tyrant with a military uniform and a funny hat.
ARTICLE VIII: You don't have the right to a job. All of us sure want all
of  you to have one, and will gladly help you along in hard times, but we
expect you to take advantage of the opportunities of education and
vocational training laid before you to make yourself useful.
 ARTICLE IX: You do not have the right to happiness. Being an American
means that you have the right to pursue happiness - which by the way, is
a lot easier if you are unencumbered by an overabundance of idiotic laws
created by those of you who were confused by the Bill of Rights.

@_subject: What's really in PGP 5.5? 
Jon clearly states one half of the problem here.  The other half is what
seems to be below the surface in many of the responses to PGP 5.5.  That
is, how do I achieve the secure deletion of data?
When I make a telephone call, I have an expectation that the only record of
the call will be in my memory and the memory of the person at the other
end.  At one time, people recording telephone conversations were required
to include a beep every 15 seconds to notify the participants that this
expectation was being violated.  (It seems this expectation has always been
violated by law enforcement.)
Now email is a confounding medium because it is both a transient
communication medium and a storage medium.  We would like to be able to
have protection against losing access to our stored data, at the same time
we are sure that those who violate our trust and intercept our
communications can not read the data, when it is sent or at any time in the
PGP 5.5 seems to have a solution to the "lose your data" problem.  It does
not seem to address the secure deletion problem.
In the context of computer system backup, one paper at the last Usenix
Security Conference suggested implementing secure deletion by encrypting
the data on the backup tape and then destroying the key when you wanted to
delete the data.

What I have heard about these suitcase nukes is that they yield about 1-2
kilotons.  I know of no technical reason for them to be thermonuclear
devices.  As such, the decay of tritium would not seem to affect them.
(They will still need a source of neutrons, which might go bad faster than
the plutonium/U235.)

@_subject: Defeating MITM with Eric's Secure Phone 
When I suggested using code words to exchange the checksum, I thought you
would have to use them in one-time-pad mode to be secure.  The following
argument makes me think you can reuse them several times, changing them at
about the same rate as you would change a symmetric crypto key.
Assume that the contents of the paper are secret between Alice and Bob.
When Alice calls Bob, she reads the word coresponding to the first digit of
the checksum.  Either Mallory is in the middle or he isn't.  If he isn't,
no problem.  The word list remains secure.
If he is in the middle, he has 15 chances in 16 of being caught on the
first exchange.  He only survives if the first digit of the Alice-Mallory
connection is the same as the first digit of the Mallory-Bob connection.
He now knows the word for one value and can continue to play 1 out of 16
The probability he can survive the next word that Bob reads to Alice is
harder to calculate.  He can survive if the second digit of the Mallory-Bob
connection is the same as the second digit of the Alice-Mallory connection,
or the second digit of the Alice-Mallory connection is the same as the
first digit on that connection.  Without doing the math, Mallory's survival
probability becomes very small as the exchange continues.
If Alice and Bob catch Mallory, they talk about the weather and exchange a
new list by email.  If they don't, there is a very high probability that
the word list has not been compromised, and they can safely continue to use
it for the next call.
BTW - I really like John's idea of doing another exchange later in the
conversation.  Perhaps something like, "You know, I was dancing the Foxtrot
with my wife 9 days ago at 5AM."

John - You're absolutely right.  I haven't had a phone connection fail
after connect for a coon's age, but I remember the bad old days of living
in GTE-land.  (For example, the time I called my wife from work and she
asked me to call Kristine and have her call because no one in Los Gatos
could call out.)
A comm failure during authentication should be enough reason to go to the
next set of 16 words.
N.B. I was assuming that Alice would only commit one digit to Bob before
having Bob commit one digit to her.  It seems from our analysis that doing
it one digit at a time greatly improves the chances of catching Mallory

There's damn little you can do in a free society.  KeyKOS provided a

not communicate it elsewhere.  However this facility involved running the
program in what amounted to solitary confinement.  While you can get away
to doing this to programs, people are (rightfully) different.

@_subject: proposal: commercial data recovery 
This requirement tries to enforce something which can not be enforced by
technical means.  That is, when you send another person some data, there is
no technical way you can prevent them from using it however they want.  For
example, a user can always program his filters (given something like
procmail) to send decrypted data anywhere he wants.
The idea that you can control what users do with data thru technical means
is the most common flaw I see when people think about security.
N.B. I applaud Adam's direction of building the data recovery businesses
need without helping 3rd parties engage in undetected snooping.  Keeping
the decryption keys (if data is not stored in the clear) near the
legitimate copies seems to be a useful step in this direction.

All OSes have a form of self modifying code which fetches programs (as
data) from disk and then executes them (as programs) in memory.  They need
a way to flush the data cache so the instruction cache can read it.
The place where it becomes expensive in modern processors is when the
processor has seen a word as an instruction, and then you want to change it
and have the new value again interpreted as an instruction.  The way to
"legitimately" do this varies by processor.  IBM mainframes detect it
automagically and "do the right thing".  SPARCs require a special "flush"
instruction to clean out the processor I-cache/pipeline.

Telecoms Newsline
        A News Service for Telecoms Professionals
             Sponsored by Hewlett-Packard
              Issue 48: 2 September 1997
           Europe puts pressure on FCC over accounting rate moves
The European Commission (EC) has warned the US regulator, the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), that its unilateral action (see TN
46) could jeopardise the World Trade Organisation agreement on
telecoms. The FCC has rejected the WTO agreements sanctioned by the
ITU, and intends to impose its own cost-based accounting tariff for
international call terminations.
The US suffers an enormous trade deficit in telecoms services
because its international calls are much cheaper than those in many
other countries. This means that far more traffic originates in the
US for termination overseas than comes in from abroad, resulting in
American international operators paying out more than US$5 billion
per year to foreign carriers for the termination of calls.
The FCC has come up with its own benchmarking scheme which will be
introduced over the next five years. This has enraged many nations
who view it as dictatorial; it is also against the multilateral
approach of the WTO agreement. Furthermore, in the absence of
accurate data, the FCC has used countries� GDP (rather than how much
it costs overseas operators to handle calls) to set the settlement
rates that US operators will be obliged to pay overseas carriers in
future. At the moment the FCC feels that many countries� accounting
rates are inflated and bear no relation to the actual cost of
providing the service.
Poorer countries claim that it costs them much more to handle calls
because they struggle with antiquated infrastructure and that they
need the revenue from high accounting rates to cover the cost of
modernising their networks. In addition, for less developed
economies, the monies they receive in settlement rates are a precious
source of hard currency. The debate looks set to run and run with the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) stuck between a rock and
hard place, trying to find a compromise that is acceptable to all

Eavesdropping on personal computers is not limited to looking over the
shoulder of the operator or physically tapping in to an Ethernet cable.
U.S. Government standards relating to the prevention of information capture
via the emission of electromagnetic radiation from computers and peripherals
are known as TEMPEST.  However, actual TEMPEST specifications are classified.
TEMPEST aside, there are inexpensive and easily applied means for
individuals to minimize unintentional emissions from equipment.  My document
"Preventing Electromagnetic Eavesdropping," discusses these techniques.

electromagnetic emissions from data processing and related equipment.
Its goal is to limit an opponent's capability to collect information about
the internal data flow of computer equipment. Most information concerning
TEMPEST specifications is classified by the United States Government and
is not available for use by its citizens.
The reason why TEMPEST technology is particularly important for
computers and other data processing equipment is the kinds of signals
components in a computer use to talk to each other ("square waves") and
their clock speeds (measured in megahertz) produce a particularly rich set
of unintentional signals in a wide portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Because the spurious emissions occupy so wide a portion of that spectrum,
technologies used to block one portion of the spectrum (as pulling the shades
closed on a window to stop the visible light portion) are not necessarily
effective in another portion.
Unintentional emissions from a computer system can be captured and
processed to reveal information about the target systems from simple
levels of activity to even remotely copying keystrokes or capturing
monitor information. It is speculated that poorly protected systems can
be effectively monitored up to the order of one kilometer from the target
This note will examine some practical aspects of reducing the
susceptibility of your personal computer equipment to remote monitoring
using easily-installed, widely available after-market components.
   I
One way of looking at TEMPEST from the lay person's point-of-view is
that it is virtually identical to the problem of preventing electromagnetic
interference ("EMI") by your computer system to others' radios, televisions,
or other consumer electronics. That is, preventing the emission of wide-band
radio "hash" from your computers, cabling, and peripherals both prevents
interference to you and your neighbors television set and limits the useful
signal available to a person surreptitiously monitoring.
Viewing the problem in this light, there are quite a few useful documents
available form the government and elsewhere attacking this problem and
providing a wealth of practical solutions and resources. Very useful for the
lay person are:

Preventing unintended electromagnetic emissions is a relative term.
It is not feasible to reduce to zero all unintended emissions. My personal
goal, for example, might be to reduce the amount and quality of spurious
emission until the monitoring van a kilometer away would have to be in my
front yard before it could effectively eavesdrop on my computer. Apartment
dwellers with unknown neighbors only inches away (through a wall) might
want to even more carefully adopt as many of the following suggestions as
possible since signal available for detection decreases as approximately the
inverse square of the distance from the monitoring equipment to your computer.
   II
   Start with computer equipment that meets modern standards for emission.
In the United States, the "quietest" standard for computers and peripherals
is known as the "class B" level. (Class A level is a less stringent standard
for computers to be use in a business environment.).
You want to verify that all computers and peripherals you use meet the class
B standard which permits only one-tenth the power of spurious emissions than
the class A standard. If you already own computer equipment with an FCC ID,
you can find out which standard applies. Contact the FCC Consumers Assistance
Branch at 1-717-337-1212 for details in accessing their database.
Once you own good equipment, follow the manufacturer's recommendations for
preserving the shielding integrity of the system. Don't operated the system
with the cover off and keep "slot covers" in the back of the computer in
   III
   Use only shielded cable for all system interconnections.
A shielded cable surrounds the core of control wires with a metal braid or
foil to keep signals confined to that core. In the late seventies it was common
to use unshielded cable such as "ribbon" cable to connect the computer with,
say, a diskette drive. Unshielded cable acts just like an antenna for signals
generated by your computer and peripherals. Most computer manufacturer
supply shielded cable for use with their computers in order to meet FCC
standards. Cables bought from third-parties are an unknown and should be
avoided (unless you are willing to take one apart to see for yourself!)
Try to avoid a "rat's nest" of wire and cabling behind your equipment and
by keeping all cables as short as possible. You want to reduced the length of
unintended antennas and to more easily predict the likely paths of electric
and magnetic coupling from cable to cable so that it can be more effectively
   IV
   Block radiation from the power cord(s) into the house wiring.
Most computers have an EMI filter built into their body where the AC
line cord enters the power supply. This filter is generally insufficient to
prevent substantial re-radiation of EMI voltages back into the power wiring
of your house and neighborhood. To reduce the power retransmitted down
the AC power cords of your equipment, plug them in to special EMI filters
that are in turn plugged into the wall socket. I use a model 475-3
overvoltage and EMI filter manufactured by
Industrial Communication Engineers, Ltd.
P.O. Box 18495
Indianapolis, IN  46218-0495
ask for their package of free information sheets
(AC and other filters mentioned in this note are available from a wide
variety of sources including, for example, Radio Shack. I am enthusiastic
about ICE because of the "over-designed" quality of their equipment.
Standard disclaimers apply.)
This particular filter from ICE is specified to reduce retransmission of
EMI by a factor of at least 1000 in its high-frequency design range. Although
ideally every computer component using an AC line cord ought to be filtered,
it is especially important for the monitor and computer CPU to be filtered in
this manner as the most useful information available to opponents is believed
to come from these sources.
   V
   Block retransmitted information from entering your fax/modem or
   telephone line.
Telephone line is generally very poorly shielded. EMI  from your computer
can be retransmitted directly into the phone line through your modem or can
be unintentionally picked up by the magnetic portion of the EMI spectrum
through magnetic induction from power supplies or the yoke of your cathode
ray tube "CRT" monitor.
To prevent direct retransmission, EMI filters are specifically designed for
modular telephone jacks to mount at the telephone or modem, and for
mounting directly at the service entrance to the house.
Sources of well-designed telephone-line filter products include ICE
(address above) and
Box 82
Randolph, OH  44265
Your phone company or telephone manufacturer may be able to supply
you with free modular filters, although the design frequencies of these
filters may not be high enough to be effective through much of the EMI
spectrum of interest. Keep telephone lines away from power supplies of
computers or peripherals and the rear of CRTs:  the magnetic field often
associated with those device can inductively transfer to unshielded lines
just as if the telephone line were directly electrically connected to them.
Since this kind of coupling decreases rapidly with distance, this kind of
magnetic induction can be virtually eliminated by keeping as much distance
(several feet or more) as possible between the power supply/monitor yoke
and cabling.
   VI
   Use ferrite toroids and split beads to prevent EMI from escaping on
   the surface of your cables.
Ferrites are magnetic materials that,  for certain ranges of EMI
frequencies, attenuate the EMI by causing it to spend itself in heat in
the material rather than continuing down the cable. They can be applied
without cutting the cable by snapping together a "split bead" form over
a thick cable such as a power cord or by threading  thinner cable such as
telephone several times around the donut-shaped ferrite form. Every cable
leaving your monitor, computer, mouse, keyboard, and other computer
peripherals should have at least one ferrite core attentuator. Don't forget
the telephone lines from your fax, modem, telephone or the unshielded DC
power cord to your modem. Ferrites are applied as close to the EMI emitting
device as possible so as to afford the least amount of cable that can act as
an antenna for the EMI.
Good sources for ferrite split beads and toroids include
Amidon Associates, Inc.

(ask for their free information sheet)
Palomar Engineers
P.O. Box 462222
Escondido, CA  92046
(ask for their free RFI information sheet)
and Radio Shack.
   VII
   Other practical remedies.
Other remedies that are somewhat more difficult to correctly apply
include providing a good EMI "ground" shield for your computer equipment
and other more intrusive filters such as bypass capacitor filters.
You probably ought not to think about adding bypass capacitors unless you
are familiar with electronic circuits and digital design. While quite
effective, added improperly to the motherboard or cabling of a computer they
can "smooth out" the square wave digital waveform -- perhaps to the extent
that signals are interpreted erroneously causing mysterious "crashes" of
your system. In other cases, bypass capacitors can cause unwanted parasitic
oscillation on the transistorized output drivers of certain circuits which
could damage or destroy those circuits in the computer or peripherals. Also,
unlike ferrite toroids, adding capacitors requires actually physically
splicing them in or soldering them into circuits. This opens up the
possibility of electric shock, damage to other electronic components or
voiding the warranty on the computer equipment.
A good EMI ground is difficult to achieve. Unlike an electrical safety
ground, such as the third wire in a three-wire AC power system, the EMI
ground must operate effectively over a much wider part of the EMI spectrum.
This effectiveness is related to a quality known as electrical impedance. You
desire to reduce the impedance to as low a value as possible over the entire
range of EMI frequencies.
Unlike the AC safety ground, important factors in achieving low impedance
include having as short a lead from the equipment to a good EMI earth ground
as possible (must be just a few feet); the gauge of the connecting lead (the
best EMI ground lead is not wire but woven grounding "strap" or wide copper
flashing sheets; and the physical coupling of the EMI into the actual earth
ground. An 8 ft. copper-plated ground may be fine for AC safety ground, but
may present appreciable impedance resistance to an EMI voltage. Much better
would be to connect a network of six to eight copper pipes arranged in a
six-foot diameter circle driven in a foot or two into the ground,
electrically bonded together with heavy ground strap and connected to the
equipment to be grounded via a short (at most, several feet), heavy (at
least 3/4-1" wide) ground strap.
If you can achieve a good EMI ground, then further shielding possibilities
open up for you such as surrounding your monitor and computer equipment in a
wire-screen Faraday cage. You want to use mesh rather than solid sheet
because you must preserve the free flow of cooling air to your equipment.
Buy aluminum (not nylon) screen netting at your local hardware store. This
netting typically comes in rolls 36" wide by several feet long. Completely
surround your equipment you want to reduce the EMI being careful to make
good electrical bonds between the different panels of netting and your good
earth ground. I use stainless steel nuts, bolts, and lock washers along with
special non-oxidizing electrical paste (available from Electrical
contractors supply houses or from ICE) to secure my ground strapping to my
net "cages".  A good Faraday cage will add several orders of magnitude of
EMI attenuation to your system.
   VIII
   Checking the effectiveness of your work.
It is easy to get a general feeling about the effectiveness of your EMI
shielding work with an ordinary portable AM radio. Bring it very close to
the body of your computer and its cables in turn. Ideally, you should not
hear an increased level of static. If you do hear relatively more at one
cable than at another, apply more ferrite split beads or obtain better
shielded cable for this component. The practice of determining what kind of
operating system code is executing by listening to a nearby AM radio is
definitely obsolete for an well-shielded EMI-proof system!
To get an idea of the power and scope of your magnetic field emissions, an
ordinary compass is quite sensitive in detecting fields. Bring a compass
within a few inches of the back of your monitor and see whether it is
deflected. Notice that the amount of deflection decreases rapidly with
distance. You want to keep cables away from magnetic sources about as far as
required not to see an appreciable deflection on the compass.
   VIIII
   Summary
If you start with good, shielded equipment that has passed the FCC level B
emission standard then you are off to a great start. You may even be able to
do even better with stock OEM equipment by specifying "low-emission"
monitors that have recently come on the market in response to consumer fears
of extremely low frequency ("ELF") and other electromagnetic radiation.
Consistently use shielded cables, apply filtering and ferrite toroids to all
cabling entering or leaving your computer equipment. Finally, consider a
good EMI ground and Faraday cages. Beyond this there are even more effective
means of confining the electrical and magnetic components of your system
through the use of copper foil adhesive tapes, conductive paint sprays, "mu
metal" and other less common components.

hold the private key corresponding to that public key.
All of this key stuff is hidden by the user interface.  What the user sees
is:  You meet someone "in world" and give them a nickname.  When you meet
them again, the software knows that it is the same "person", and refers to
them by your nickname for them.  Thus people can develop and maintain

Consider the wonderful irony of hacking into some site and having the blame

Consider a somewhat different circumstance.  I was recently in Organ Pipe
Cactus National Monument.  The southern border of the monument runs across
the US/Mexico border.  One of the stops on the tourist drive around the
monument is a parking lot 40 feet from a broken gate in the fence that
marks the border.  There is a large sign there suggesting that people not
leave their cars because of recent breakins.  There was also broken auto
glass on the ground.
Now, if I were breaking into cars, I would pick that parking lot, rather
than others further north, in hopes that everyone would blame the Mexicans.
Don't think I am sure that the Mexicans are not responsible, just that I
see a chance for some US lowlifes to deflect the blame.
I see the same opportunity in using a hacked Navy computer to hack a marine
mammal site.  It may be the Navy, or it may be a hacker with a polished
