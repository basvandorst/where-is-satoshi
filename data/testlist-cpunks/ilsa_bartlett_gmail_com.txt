I rather read then post. Today I wish to share the Japan's Nuclear Trauma,
as the leaks continue unabated, on it's Fifth Birthday.
  Georgi,  Thank you for posting, your comment is so true...
  Tomorrow just after 2:00, Five Years Ago was the 9.2 Earth Quake in Japan.
  1800 + people died instantly. Our world is still awash with radio active
  waste still out flowing toward the west coast of the United States in all
  water around our globe.
  A Journey In Disaster. This is a Warning To The World!

  I ask you not to forget how the corporation Teco lied.

  Japan has enough bomb quality plutonium to make more than 400 hydrogen
bombs over the number they already have as test examples for how to build a
better killing bomb.
