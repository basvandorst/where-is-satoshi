This is sick. According to this, I cannot teach foreigners about
cryptography in the U.S. -- even about the open literature. This is a
grotesque denial of my first amendment rights.
They just FUCKED OFF a big chunk of your second amendment today but
I bet you don't even know about it. Do not worry, when they ban
your crypto program they will let you buy another one. What
FUCKIN' RIGHTS, I DON'T SEE NO STINKIN' RIGHTS!!!!!!
Duh what's a PGP and an FTP?
Uh Uh Uh fire's cool!

No free man shall ever be de-barred the use of arms. The strongest
reason for the people to retain  there right to keep and bear arms
is as a last  resort to  protect  themselves  against  tyranny  in
government. <-------- Thomas Jefferson                            --
