By Tom Koehler
Boeing engineer George Windsor sat in a small room at a Boeing building in
Seattle and picked up an iPhone. After a short series of finger movements
and taps, a miniature unmanned aircraft that's about as big as a pizza box
started to hover, turn and fly. In some cases, Windsor tapped on locations
on a map on the iPhone, and the UAV went to that spot; in other instances,
Windsor moved the phone up, down, left and right, and the vehicle moved
What made this flight demonstration even more fascinating is that the UAV
was hovering over a baseball field on the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology campus in Cambridge, Mass. b some 3,000 miles away.
