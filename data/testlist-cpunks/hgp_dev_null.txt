At the risk of sounding like a Bible-basher, I have to admit that
I used to regard an inordinate number of Christians as ignorant,
until I found out that many of them are quite simply being very

To tell the truth, I respected them more when I thought they
were just ignorant.
Most of the prosetylizing that I have been subjected to consists of
vague, unsubtantiated claims, followed by prophetic pronouncements
of 'the way things are', backed up by quoting the same prophetic
pronouncements to 'prove' this or that point.
Let me state that I think there are a great many 'good' Christians
in the world. i.e. - the ones that leave me the fuck alone!

  Nope. You're wrong!
