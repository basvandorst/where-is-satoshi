In that one case, yes.
The compression will vary based on the deviation from an ideally
compressable sample - for *any* bit pattern 0x0000 to 0xFFFF you would
expect to see it once in 2^32 trials (by definition) therefore you will
get a mix of compressable and uncompressable patterns, with uncompressable
patterns being more likely (simply because there are more of them in the
full range of available patterns 0x0000 to 0xFFFF
randomness is a funny thing. a truely random file can be *anything* that
is the right length - including a excerpt from william shakespere
(provided you have enough monkeys)
it is most likely to be random garbage, for a large sample - but for a
very small sample the odds of it being an ordered sample are surprisingly
the obvious example here is a double coin test - two bits. an ordered
sample would be both heads or both tails. a disordered sample would be one
head and one tail. in practice, you would expect to see half the results
from a larger trial (say 32 double-throws) with a ordered sample, and half
as you reach three coins, the odds of a completely ordered result decrease
(from 2 in 2^2, to 2 in 2^3). for four coins, you still have the same two
compressable results. consider:
HHHH    HHHT    HHTH    HHTT
HTHH    HTHT    HTTH    HTTT
THHH    THHT    THTH    THTT
TTHH    TTHT    TTTH    TTTT
in a large trial, you would expect to see each of these once every 2^4
tests, on the average. obviously HHHH and TTTT are very compressable.
assuming a runlength encoding, I don't think any of the others are
compressable at all.....

that would be my email provider - and hence me. sorry. They suck in many
ways, but they give an efficient free service with tls support; one of the
ways they suck is to either
a) hide some of your mail in a folder invisible to pop3 (so you have to
use their german-only and non-fishable interface to go look)
b) add that bloody stupid header to random emails that they think are spam
(no idea what criteria is in use as it is all in german)
I meant surprising for Sarad - Much of this discussion pre-assumes that he
*does* misunderstand probability but is willing to substitute our
collective insanity for his current ignorance :)
Erm - what was that? a misplaced .sig?
