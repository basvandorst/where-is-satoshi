Aye, but by whom, on whom?
"A _tongue_in_cheek_ announcement from the group claims that cDc 'has
more targeted experience than anyone else in this field'."
(emphasis is mine)
For me (and thus, naturally, subject to vague romanticisings), the whole article casts an underlying impression that the cDc are using the opportunity to legally advance in their chosen field of expertise. And, from their point of view, why not? (Not to say that I agree with the closed-source obscurity involved in any way.)
Bizarrely(?), the article originally posted to the list by Jei, and that pointed to by the URL in the same message bear discrepancies - quite how these subtle additions worked their way in or out I'm not sure, but the noticeable ones are the headline/author/date, and the addition in the message body of allusions to a RIAA-oriented front rather than an unseen, unpatriotic nemesis that the FBI has so far been concerned with:
The web article quotes...
Reid Fleming, a cDc member, said: "Never before has the US faced a more troublesome enemy. To meet this growing challenge, the FBI has announced an ongoing effort to create and deploy best-of-breed electronic surveillance software.
Compared to the message body...
"...To meet this growing challenge _of_fileswap_terrorism_, the FBI has Checking out the cDc's press release at
reveals some further details, including the idealised purposes of the "The new system will be designed to guard against internet fraud, identity theft*, unauthorized system access*, virus writing*, industrial espionage*, child pornography, information warfare*, public corruption**, composing hate speech, and other serious felonies which threaten the security of our nation and the safety of its citizens."
* Oh, the infathomable irony!
** Or awareness. Whichever comes first.
OK, so no copyright detection techniques in there. Yet.
It then goes on to describe the plans for an established "plug-in" technique to enable plug-n-play spyware, such as Image Analysis (for recognising naughty pictures), trigger word monitoring, and (IMHO most interestingly) this one:
     "LOGIC AND GRAMMAR ENGINES will be able to detect telltale signs of mental disturbance. In conjunction with the text search capability, this feature will weed out the merely neurotic from the dangerously insane."
All thats needed now is to tie it neatly into the N-Gram thread...
But where was the media?

Flantastic! What possible reason could the FBI have come up with (and I would love to see a copy of the request for MonkeyBrain's database) for obtaining such confidential data, even if/especially when illegally obtained in the first place... The only disheartening side of this is that 99% of the people who *should* be querying that list won't ever hear of it... Ah yes, the media loves to report the gory stuff, yet seems all too ready to ignore the /useful/ bits...
Of course, if report mails form the virus were sent to another dozen-and-a-half addresses too, what's the FBI doing about *those* accounts? Did Yahoo et al. just hand over the data as requested? I find it hard to believe that the FBI chased up just one avenue...
Furthermore, under the second phase of the UK Data Protection Act [ if the forthcoming Hague Convention on Jurisdiction and Foreign Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters

Only if they first define the terms for "society" - once the definition of such has been twisted to a desirable position (apparently one of a superior, over-riding patriotism in the US), then the introduction of backdoors becomes infintely more arguable. However, should law enforcement be distinguished from law making? Are the motivations of those that want to form a new society different to those that just want to lock up the people who don't?
The SSSCA is a prime example of universal back entrancing - an introduction of government-certified security schemes? What chance would there be that any, if not all of them, would have some kind of unpublicised (at least at first) get-in clause? This scares me more than any possible security flaw...

On your own roads. And the car maker tells you where you can go to. And which route you have to take. And where you can end up. And then forces you to pay for a map.
If the patent hasn't been picked up by the courts yet, then why not? *If* the SSSCA were to come into effect (and I have heard little about it for several months now... biding its time?), then surely all other OSes (subject to legal boundaries) would be prevented by the patent from implementing the requirements in the bill?

While I must admit that the implementation of such an idea is intriguing from a purely technical point of view (and has probably been much discussed in various circles), the transition to patenting it with an eye to produce a working product makes its threat to consumer choice all the more real. This is the next, logical step following application/hardware-specific DRM that we are seeing now. After that, it's a small jump to global AOLness - an OS that will only accept content from specific sources, rather than a source that will only play on a specific OS...
The patent was filed Jan 8th 1999, so they've obviously been keeping it in consideration for a while before that, I would assume. It also proves that MS haven't just filed this in light of the recent paranoia or the increasing tension amongst the music industry over the past year or so - according to the kids' FAQ at the USPTO it does take about 22 months to get a patent, so this would have happened in spite of the fearful state of the current music and film industries. This probably means MS have code written for it, a database set-up waiting for the INSERTs to come flooding in, a launch party planned and years of security patches waiting...

One practical method that has been, and still remains popular it seems, is a trusted hub approach. DirectConnect, as a more recent example, allows anyone to set up a central hub, and then filter the people connecting to it (e.g. by amount of files shared, or by personal acquaintance), in a very "localised" peer-2-peer group. This is the same tactic adopted by pre-Napster set-ups such as IRC channels, et al.
The obvious downside is immediate choice. Obscurity is naturally exaggerated in comparison to a completely open network. However, smaller groups tend to encourage increased validity of files being offered, especially when only a small number of those people are offering it.
This obscurity can be countered in a number of ways - chained networking, in that one person can be in many groups and thus has access to a wider range, coupled with an anonymous request/barter-driven facility would decrease obscurity without losing much of the validity implicit in trusted groups. History suggests that even in such fragmented environments, content can travel to as many people in as short a time as an open network.
Under this scenario, the opportunities to spread false files are much more limited, as their scope from origin would be more contained, probably averaging 2 or 3 interlinked groups at most.
Not perfect, clearly. But it does seem to be the surviving philosophy.

@_subject: FC: Hollywood wants to plug "analog hole," regulate A-D 
And/or indeed, on newer players. In the UK at least ( the new generation of anti-theft CDs have been reported to be useless on modern DVD players/car stereos, by design. Some older players either lack the "feature" or are less sensitive, I assume, so can be ok. It's just a case of matching a technology with the right player...
So not content with limiting public demand for new hardware (a minor issue), the extra precautions actively encourage consumers to not buy legal content. Woo. Better to get illegal content that you can do what you want with.
With regards to the analog[ue]/digital stop-gapping, r o f l m a o. This would be just as effective as, ooh, copy-protecting CDs? Oh, humm... Chasing down peer-to-peer outfits? Uhh... Trying to ban videos? Oh, wait...
Firstly, in order to prevent widespread ripping of analog signals through disabling mass consumer device, there needs to /be/ mass consumer ripping. How many people do you know who actually go to the trouble of transferring their taped episodes/films onto their PC? It's not as simple as grabbing mp3s. As with other such "distribution" in its relevant infancy, the hard work's carried out by a much smaller number of people - millions of films may be downloaded every month, but there's generally only 2 or 3 versions of each film, from different sources, max. Believing that crippling the populace will fill this tiny leak is... well, amusing.
Secondly, how much work is going to go into protecting a fading technology? This is from both the MPAA's and the consumers' points of view. For the former, analog avoidance is only of any use if the content is not readily available in digital format already. Most of the analog content that I guess the MPAA want to stop conversion of is either people in cinemas with cameras, or people with tapes of episodes at home. The former is hard to stop through watermarking (I'm unsure of the technicalities, but I'd have thought preserving it between screen and camera would be tricky? Even without people geting uo and walking past the view...), and even then it's only one source of films. The latter is, I suspect, more the target of the MPAA's volley. If this doesn't move towards digital origins, i.e. through PVRs or cable-streams obtained via PC (which are subject to a different smother), then the abundance of existing technology, and probable (anonymous) circumvention   of new ones anyway renders all actions proposed useless. The question then is how much investment do you want to throw away?
Outside the US, I suspect that the circumvention may go the same way as DVD region "control". Looking at players recently, it was quite hard (after checking around, as most people would) to actually _avoid_ region-locked DVD players. The only real factor that really keeps regions in place is their localised supply to meatspace shops, or the boundaries of international postage & packing.
Foolishness, foolishness, and yet more foolishness. Perhaps if we just ignore them, then they'll go away eventually :)

Agreed, the mechanics of a system are unimportant from a user's point of view, so long as it works and they can work it. What magic crypto should strive for, though, is an understanding in users of the effects its presence promotes, and the ramifications involved when it is lacking.
SSL for commerce is readily in place without batting an eyelid these days. However, I'd be interested to know just how many users out there would enter their card details on an unprotected site, despite the unclosed padlocks and the alert boxes. Have security fears and paranoia been abated by widespread crypto to the point whereby users will happily transmit private data, whether encrypted or nay, just because they *perceive* the threat to now be minimal? Now that the media has grown tired of yet-another-credit-card-hack story?
Pointers to any evidence/research into this much appreciated... ta.

Indeed, why bother? How about a system that removes your right to vote if you haven't exercised it in the last 3 elections? That way you cut out all those who really don't care, and provide an incentive for those who might. Nothing grabs attention like threatening to remove Make sure there's a handy "abstain" option for those who want to get the point across about lack of choice, and maybe a space to say why, too. Then stick the (anonymous) reasons up in a publicly-viewable space and eh, instant feedback.
