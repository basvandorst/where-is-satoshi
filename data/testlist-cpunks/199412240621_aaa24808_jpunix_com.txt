The State Department may claim the right to have some say in things under the Commerce Clause, Article 1, Sec. 8 of the Constitution.  Seems to me, however, that the Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments pretty clearly slap this claim down: the right to trade freely predates the United States, and is hence "reserved... to the people", in the language of the Tenth.                                    -dlj.
