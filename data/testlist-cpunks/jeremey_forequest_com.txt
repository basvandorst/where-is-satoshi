Did the library include other encryption functions, other than one-way
functions? If so, I could see it being restricted. Linux, which is freely
available anywhere, includes a DES-using crypt() one-way hash. But since
a one-way hash function (implemented as a one way function) can't really
be used for encrypted communication, I don't think it is subject to
export restriction.

@_subject: (fwd) krypt13i.zip Enkryptonator: Homonymous key encryption system, R. Newton 
I downloaded the thing... here's what I posted to sci.crypt:
Looks like snake oil to me... the whole thing comes down to each executable
having a unique "registration number" so that only that copy of the software
can decrypt with that "registration number".  You encrypt with a key
of between 5 and 10 text characters, and you provide the registration number
of the destination party. The "registration number" and key get combined
in some way to form the encryption key.  (Registration numbers are public
information).  Since ONLY ;) the destination party has the correct copy of
the software, only they can decrypt the data, hence the key can be passed
over an insecure channel. Heh. They say the encryption algorithm is a form
of substitution cipher.
SO.... since the "registration number" and key are public, the only thing
keeping this together is the lack of the algorithm, which of course doesn't
keep it together at all.

@_subject: Twenty Bank Robbers -- CLARIFICATION 
Assuming "perfect" intelligence on the part of the robbers (i.e. they will
follow deterministic behavior and do the "right" thing), then here's what
must happen IMO (1 being the first guy and 20 being the last):
1 must propose that 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19 all split
the money evenly. All of these will vote for it, assuming they're all
perfectly smart and deduce the inevitable outcome.
I arrived at this working backward from the case where two robbers are left.
If 2 are left (19 & 20), 19 gets all the money. So 20 will vote for whatever
18 says, which MUST include 20 in the deal. Since 19 knows this, 19
will vote for whatever 17 says, which must include 19 in the deal, and so
forth. Eventually you arrive at the conclusion that 1,3,5...,19 must
all agree to split the money at the beginning.

Allright, considering the 3rd goal, I think the first guy gets all the money and everyone lives.
Here's why:
in the case of 2, 19 takes it all and 20 gets nothing. So with 3,
since 20 will get nothing with 2 left, he may as well vote for 18 to get it all, since that increases the number who survive.
So with 4, 17 proposes that 17 get all the money, and since 19 and 20
are already resigned to getting nothing, they will go along with 17.
Following this to the end, the first guy gets all the money and everyone  - -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Hrm... that should foster communication. So lemme see if I understand your
point... everyone in the U.S needs to devise their own cryptosystem,
and then use it to communicate securely. To who? Since I can't publish
my system for fear the government will find it out and then restrict it,
noone else will know about it. I can have a good old time encrypting stuff
to myself, but that's about it. And the likelihood that I'm an expert
cryptographer in order to design a good system is pretty remote.
