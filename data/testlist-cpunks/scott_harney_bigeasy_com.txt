Guess I was logged in at the right time this morning.  Judges ruled 3-0 that the CDA is unconstitutional.  hooray.
I thought a little rejoicing was warranted. :)

I don't have a problem with companies escrowing keys or using a function like that described for Viacrypt's for official company business.  Employees should be made fully aware, however, that their communications are being copied to a company archive.  There should be no illusion about the privacy of company communications using company-owned software.
For private communications, they should still use a personal copy of PGP or other encryption software of their choice.
