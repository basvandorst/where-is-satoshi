  In the TREAD Act of November 1, 2000, Congress
  required the National Highway Traffic Safety
  Administration (NHTSA) to develop a rule requiring
  all new motor vehicles to be equipped with a warning
  system to indicate to the operator when a tire is
  significantly underinflated.
    Each sensor had a unique digital identification
  code so that the particular tire with low pressure
  could be identified on the driver's display. The
  digital identification code also prevented signals
  from other vehicles' sensors from being analyzed
  by the TPMS.

Anyone following the "Obfuscated TCP" kernel patch
set and userspace library?
  Fast opportunistic crypto at the TCP level.
Looks like a useful way to make it difficult for
ISPs to use services such as Phorm and NebuAd to
collect user tracking data and ad revenue -- so
webmasters should be all over it.  And, of course,
it's protection against forged RST attacks.
Doesn't work if the attacker is willing to spend
more and do an MITM attack, though.

Douglas McClendon sounds like our kind of people.
    I posted this in a thread on this topic on another
mailing list where some relevant Google people are
also active:
Thanks to the CFAA, violating your ToS is a _felony_.
I understand that you want to use plain language, and
not be "lawyerly", but if you're a ToS writer, Federal
law has been outsourced to you, and you have to deal
with it.  (CFAA reform is a separate issue--I'm just
talking about the law as it stands now.)
How can you tell people, "you're party to a legally
binding contract that can put you in Federal prison
if you violate it, but go ahead and break it, off
the record we're fine with that"?
It's as if someone interrupted the office Nerf gun
wars to take your Nerf pistol and hand you a real
gun -- and you kept playing.

Corporate speak: "Tawakol and Ingis both said the
new technology, which is still under development,
would allow companies to use alternative approaches
that are sometimes called statistical or probabilistic
tracking, while remaining in compliance with industry
privacy standards."
Translation: "Fine, you smug cookie-blocking nerds.
We're going to go all browser fingerprinting on you."
  Mozilla has been working on cleaning up the
third-party cookie problem, and making a dent in it,
as you can tell by the complaints from the creepy
adtech business.
Unfortunately, Firefox appears to be highly
 says "Your browser
fingerprint appears to be unique among the 3,458,043
tested so far."
Ouch.  Got to get my act together here.  But of
course the more that I customize, the more unique my
browser looks.
Who's got a browser that comes up reasonably generic
on Panopticlick, and what did you do?
