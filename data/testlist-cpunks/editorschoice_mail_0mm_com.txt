@_subject: CDR: Editor's Choice: Winning Stocks in the Insurance  
TODAY'S NEWSLETTER LOOKS AT WINNING STOCKS IN THE INSURANCE A number of insurance stocks hit 52-week highs in recent weeks, in
part because several Wall Street analysts raised their ratings and
earnings estimates for these firms. Over the past three months, insurance shares are up 9 percent while the S&P 500 index has dipped 2 percent. What many investors like about these companies is their growth beyond the insurance business. Many providers are looking like financial services firms with diverse product lines. Other firms are expanding their businesses globally or raising their premiums. In today's newsletter, we look at companies, trends, and financial performance in the insurance business.
