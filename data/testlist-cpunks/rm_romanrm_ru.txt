Is that really supposed to be the "best" part?
$5-$7 today gets you a VPS with 1-2TB of bandwidth per month,
$17 gets you a Core Duo dedicated server with two HDDs and 5 TB of
bandwidth, And $26 gets you a Dual Xeon dedicated server with 10 TB of bandwidth.
So no, $30/mo for just one bridge (as I read the website, with only 40 GB of
bandwidth???) is not the most efficient use of your funds.
