This comes up far too often.
How would you know a system had been fully tested?
How long would it take?
Can you think of a better way to avoid system failures than test-and-fix for a period of decades or more?
Testing is important for two main reasons:
to try to validate the assumptions you have made about the system's
environment; to detect systems that are egregiously bad, so that you can
scrap them and start again.
Computer scientists and programmers were saying all this 25 years ago. We
won't improve much on the current failure rates of projects until we accept
it, and act on it.

What other industry would get away with selling a product that isn't fit for
purpose, and then blaming the customers for failing to be quick enough to
carry out repairs?
The vendors should be liable for the consequences of their incompetence and
lack of professionalism. Let's stop blaming the customers.
