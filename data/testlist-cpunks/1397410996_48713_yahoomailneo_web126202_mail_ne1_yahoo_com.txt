It is not that your idea didn't "stick" but we have a different problem today than two centuries ago when patents were invented.
Patents were invented when people were very ignorant and simple things like boiling cucumbers inside a tightly sealed glass was an innovation that changed the world. Basically anything at that time was something simple yet important enough to warrant a patent.
Until the beginning of the 20th century.
Now as you pointed out, it is not a matter of creating something nobody knows about. All problems are solvable, it is just a matter of someone putting their hands into it.
Big things that would be patentable today, which are not obvious to anyone would be things like Star Wars hovering vehicles, light sabers, etc.
One patentable thing is from a guy that made a new kind of cellphone antenna that tracks the devices and sends individual beams to each device using less power and being much faster, you may have heard about it. That's something which is not easy and cannot be easily done with current technology.
How many times in a year do you hear about such inventions?
But like in ancient times, such wild ideas come out only every once in a while. That wouldn't keep the patent offices, lawyers, attorneys, engineers and all those that orbit around it occupied and pockets filled.
It looks like we ought to find other jobs for such people, otherwise they will fight tooth and nail to continue having every insignificant little invention patentable.
