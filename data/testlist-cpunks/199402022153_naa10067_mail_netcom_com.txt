@_subject: Remailer FAQ. Info request! 
I have only seen unsatisfying info on the remailers out there. If people
know the details up front, the Cypherpunk remailers will become more popular.
Different people have different needs for remailing as well.
Please help me out with this. I would appreciate info from operators as
well as users of remailers. If you do not want to disclose a specific
bit of info, I will enter it as "N/A". If I get no answer at all I will
leave it as "?". Send responses to qwerty at netcom.com. If you wish your
remailer be taken off the list I will comply.
