[1] Phone Calls Lead to Cocaine Smugglers
Copyright: 1994 by Reuters, R
Lines: 18
        TAMPA, Fla (Reuter) - Authorities seized more than a ton of
cocaine and arrested 11 people Wednesday, using information
gleaned from the smugglers' cellular phone calls, a sheriff's
spokesman said.
         The smugglers had tampered with the cellular phones to make
it appear as if the calls were made from other telephone
         But U.S. Customs agents and local deputies eavesdropped on
the conversations, using sophisticated technology to trace the
calls to their true sources, said Jack Espinosa, spokesman for
the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office.
         The investigators learned the cocaine was being sent from
Panama to Miami in a shipping container with false walls, then
tracked the shipment to Tampa.
        They arrested 10 people in Tampa and one in Miami on
racketeering and cocaine trafficking charges and seized the
cocaine. It weighed in at 2,205 pounds, and is worth about $95

@_subject: message pools. 
Request-Remailing-To: cypherpunks at toad.com
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Jim asked about message pools. Why not just start using alt.test? It's really
not such a noisy group compared to say comp.org.eff.talk ;-)! You must
include "ignore" in your subject line, or the remailer you use will
be swamped by autoresponder messages. And as long as a PGP message already
tattles what the nickname on the key it is encrypted with is, you can up
front put that nickname in the Subject header. At worse, if you want to
"hide" it, just remove the header and footer that announces it's a PGP
message. No one will really notice. You could even add a jpeg header and
laugh at the poor soul who tries to view that "ignore Stacy" jpeg that
he never saw in alt.binaries.picures.erotics. No remailer operators like
me to have to trust. No central pool software. Fuck the waste of bandwidth
complaints, your just running a TEST. You still have to run through a remailer
though, to alt.test at news.cs.indiana.edu, so use encrypted remailing. You
can't use those that strip Subject lines, though even if qwerty did strip
Subjects, the return address is in there as "qwerty-remailer" so I wouldn't
see the autoresponds.
I know this isn't a new idea, but he did ask for ideas. You still have to
get the other person to "join the pool" (read alt.test), but that's easier
than getting them to join a real pool which will fill his mailbox daily
with garbage. And you can tell him to "join the pool" in public, say
anonymously on this list, or on Usenet or for God sakes send him an
anonymous snail mail letter! Whatever you do, since "Stealth-PGP" isn't
here yet, I don't see a reason not to include the person's anonymous
nickname in the Subject line or at least in the message, and make
everybody's lives much easier!
I think certain post-by-mail services like news.cs.indiana.edu function like
anonymous remailers if you forge mail to them, in that they strip much
of you original headers away, including the real path but you then have to
connect directly to that post-by-mail site and end up on their logs.
As far as problems go, I don't think the bandwidth problem would be
a big problem since what, maybe a dozen people would be really doing
this in a given week? Perhaps "strength in numbers" isn't going to be
possible yet in the next few years. So be a little naughty and use the
world-wide pool that already exists. The hell with internet bandwidth;
this is one's privacy at stake! I don't have an exciting enough life, so
let me know how it goes if you try it.
 -=Xenon=-
P.S. Maybe Stealth-PGP is a secret and is the reason the jpegs on
alt.binaries.pictures.erotics have become so "noisy" lately ;-).
P.S.S. I'm going to start reading alt.test and misc.test, but I will
not look at anything unless you put "ignore Xenon" in the Subject line!
Look Ma, I'm in a pool. Somebody send me a message, and send me an
anonymous public key within it, and I'll respond back the same way.
Don't sign the Encrypted message; clearsign the message within it!
Then nobody will know "Mr. Nickname" signed it. Why not contact
Pr0duct Cypher this way? Then you aren't taking up space in
alt.security.pgp. Afterall what's a 40K-100K message compared
to how much is in the binaries groups a day?! And you can easily
scan a day's alt.test postings for you name, then trash the rest.
You can even automatically scan the postings for you nickname with
most news readers. Sorry this is so long. I do have a nasty habit of
thinking in public.
P.S.S.S Extropia already has a pool set up, but I've been lazy and
don't know the details yet. With Usenet though, you never end up
on any pool's member list, except the list of all Usenet readers, and
possibly all remailer users if such a list exists. And a guy like
Pr0duct can NEVER be tagged for having picked up the message! No?

-= qwerty remailer shutdown notice =-
Disclaimer: none.
OK tentacles, damage control time. See what one post can start? And you
think alt.w.a.s.t.e. would survive (see forwarded posts from Usenet)? I
have just remembered that I arrived here on this mailing list in need of
remailers, since I was being anonymously Xenon. For that I gave up my
anonymity, to the remailer operators. Then I decided to gain some
legitimacy by starting my own remailer on Netcom. As Netcom has no
Manhattan number yet, and I like to connect at lab, that blew my anonymity
for any Unix skilled person who wanted to find out who I was. Finally I
lost sight of why I really came here, which was to find out ways to get PGP
out to people. And now that I'm posting via qwerty, I don't even need a
remailer network any more.
I have also come to realize that in the next five years, the ONLY solution
to keep people from abusing the remailers is a human being sitting there
moderating the remailer. As I do not have the time, and do NOT think it
would be profitable to try to pay some undergraduate to moderate qwerty, I
have decided to shut qwerty down. The only other solution in my mind is to
have qwerty forge its return address, a solution that will likely get my
account revoked when the shit hits the fan after just ONE abuse causing
postmaster at netcom.com to have to pour through sendmail logs and process
logs or whatever, to find me. And qwerty at netcom.com has become the "PGP
Information Clearinghouse". Yes I find it amusing to see "fuck-wads" whine
about one bad post to their oh so precious little narrow-minded newsgroup,
but I no longer see qwerty at netcom.com as an expendable resource, which I
can afford to loose.
I thought of remaining on the Cypherpunks mailing list, only because
Pr0duct Cypher (PGP Tools and Magic Money), Will Kinney (Curve Encrypt),
and a few other bright lights post here. But I am a man of action, not of
debate, and even on turning to debate on this list, I find very few out
here who are as smart, humane, creative, or radical as I am, and therefore
I become unfulfilled with the level of discussion I am able to find. I made
a big mistake turning away from product development and information
distribution to debate, and trying to change people's opinions. This was
what lead me to science. I can be found on Usenet, if ever my unsubscribe
request will be fulfilled by Eric Hughes, who cannot even figure out how to
automate a mailing list, or avoid silly errors with the remailing software.
I am sorry to express my disappointment, and the fault lies only with
myself, for I mistook you for adults. When a real (my favorite word)
cryptography mailing list appears, and is announced on Usenet, I shall
The "Cypherpunks" have disappointed me, for as I have said before, they are
not punks. Nor, I have found, are they "Cypher", if that imply them being
competent activists. Hell, they can't even run a mailing list or an ftp
site. The clincher came today, when I asked Eric Hughes, "founder of the
Cypherpunk movement", about why the FUCK he hasn't fixed macpgp2.3.cpt.hqx
to reflect the fact that it is a .gz file, not a .hqx text file. This,
after I posted it very loudly to the list that it had a corrupt name, and
that a month after I posted the same thing to Usenet. What he told me was
this, and I apologize for the pathetic act of posting "personal e-mail" but
well, FUCK YOU if it bothers you, or doesn't conform to some RFC standard
of "netiquette":
And this is our Great White Hope for who will run our future e-bank, and
revolution culminating in the fall of the government as we know it? He who
speaks in tongues instead of English, about remailers? When I stop
laughing, I'll start crying. And Eric, "Hey". Sure liked that STUPID
Cypherpunks meeting, with all the God Damned, "Eric_Hughes [Guest] orders
Medusa, One Medusa, coming right up!, Don't got your snakes on today, Might
I recommend a needle with that?, The bacteria on the bar die as the drink
is set down., ld brings Eric_Hughes [Guest] a Medusa."
PhUcK y0u EveRyb0dy ;-). Bye, till I get my hands on Stealth-PGP, which
should be a few days from now. Then the fun begins: sophisticated
steganography. I hope it works out with Stealth-PGP, so I don't have to
convince people to rewrite PGP from the ground up, 'cause as you know it
takes a lot of work to get past those "closed doors" to talk to those secretive
developers of the (grassroots) upcoming new de-facto encryption standard.
Why don't I disappear silently? Because I know there are many "lurkers" out
there who would appreciate knowing why I left. I get mail from them often.
In fact, I think the greatest power in this list, if it has power, lies in
the hands of the "lurkers". Those who spread PGP, one copy at a time, and
wish to learn here, not live here. And because I want this great audience
to hear my words, for I think they matter and will have influence, for I
say nay, these are not activists, these "Cypherpunks". They are greedy
e-yuppies, who would use encryption for personal gain, at the expense of
their fellow man. I have discovered that and I now must part ways, hoping I
do not loose contact with those few out here on the internet who are
straight thinkers and straight arrows.
Another pathetically motivated, but this time nostalgic, quote from
personal e-mail:

I saw the posts myself... The best comment I saw was a followup post,
to the effect of "some darn kids out there have been taking William
Gibson a little too seriously."
A little more seriously, though: Yes, it may be very hard to find out
who is participating in this scam -- given the number of anonymous
posting services and anonymous ftp sites (some of which don't log
their transactions at all) they could hide for quite some time from
semi-casual scrutiny.
However, given CERT's fairly long arm in this arena, I suspect it
wouldn't take long for a concerted effort on the part of CERT to shut
them down. That depends on CERT's perception of "blacknet" as a
serious security threat -- I can't speak for them, but I'd hazard to
guess that they are about as concerned about "blacknet" as we at
SURAnet are... which is to say "not at all". (I base this guess on a
lack on response from CERT regarding these posts.)
I also think that blacknet's reach exceeds their grasp -- the claims
they make about "sending cash" and "depositing funds in accounts you
specify" strikes me as mighty big talk from a group that isn't on Dunn
and Bradstreet's register. If anything, their goals are probably much
more short term, like ripping off anyone foolish enough to show
interest in their "service." And of course, there's always the chance
that it was just a joke/boast/prank. Usenet is the Net of a Million
Lies, after all....

What bothers me is not the blacknet itself, but the attitude of the

Is this possible? Would/Could CERT actually do this if they wanted to?
