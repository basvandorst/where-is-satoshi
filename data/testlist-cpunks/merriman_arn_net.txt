It would be Really Nice if the next version of the brutessl software had a

local logging of results: ie, CHAL2a.dat, CHAL2b.dat, etc).
        > a Windows 3.1 variant (or even win32s)
I've got 3 machines (386sx-33, 386DX-20, 486DX2-80), with an option on my
roommates machine (386DX-40), all connected via Windows for Workgroups. All
4 are set up with win32s, so could do a *lot* better at keysearches if the
software was available. There's plenty of support for Unix variants, and
even NT/95, but us humble Win/DOS users are kinda left hanging a bit.
Maybe next challenge, we can pre-allocate keyspace based on the results of
this one: look at how fast folks are reporting results, and allocate chunks
of space accordingly (maybe based on an 8-hour 'cycle'). Sure take some of
the load off the poor server :-)

While I respect the ideas and opinions submitted by the majority of the
members of this list, I wonder if perhaps we're failing to deal with the
_root_ problem of such things as the CDA, Clipper, DTA, etc.
Specifically, I wonder if it wouldn't be a better approach to *prevent* such
measures from ever being proposed in the first place.
(pause to adjust nomex undies and titanium body armor :-)
Is there any precedence or possibility of either filing civil or criminal
charges against a Government official for their _official_ actions?
Something that will not only make for some Serious Press, but hit them from
an unexpected angle?
(close hatch on bunker :-)
It would seem that things such as the CDA, etc, are patent violations of the
Bill of Rights. As such, wouldn't the Congressrodent(s) proposing such
measures be violating our civil rights, and thus be criminally liable?
Aren't Congressrodents supposed to take an Oath of Office that involves
upholding the Constitution?
Alternatively, could a civil suit be filed for invasion of privacy or
somesuch? Or perhaps the previously mentioned violation of civil rights (a
la Rodney King)?
How many laws, etc, can we invoke? I mean, most congresscritters don't craft
laws on their own, so the involvement of their staff would constitute
conspiracy, as well, wouldn't it?
I'd think that if a few of the  were sued
and/or tried, it would sure make the rest of them consider the full
implications of any laws they might consider proposing. Too, it might
accidentally ripple through all of the Government, and settle down some of
the beaurocrats that aren't subject to voters.
IANAL, of course, so I'll leave it up to those on the list who are to
express more informed opinions; still, it _seems_ like a possible course of

Zhilchistan on the Hudson
Remember central Asian genius Vasily Ovariaidt of Zhilchistan? ("Zhilchistan
Moon," December/January 1994.) In my admittedly goofy idea piece, Ovaraidt
basically took over the the world by exporting /privacy/ instead of yak
hides, and ended up with much of the global economy passing through his
hands - minus, of course, his 1 percent service charge. With income tax
rates in some Western nations way up in the 70 percent range or worse, there
was a /lot/ of reason to work through Zhichistan.
Now hey - why leave such a scheme to a tinpot dictator from the steppes? We
could do it right here, do it better, and make it stick for all time - and
dump the IRS in thr process. Nay, we could /export/ the IRS, and get top
dollar for it from backward countries who think they can prosper by
punishing the industrious.
I'm serious this time. Here's the deal: For maybe the cost of a dozen
stealth bombers, the U.S. could create a satellite-based electronic funds
transfer system that could literally pass every single financial transaction
in the world through its hands every day.
Computability isn't the issue. It's simple arithmetic and bandwidth. The
quality of the hardware  - that is, communications technology - dictates the
success of the systems. Nobody does that better than us.
On the surface, the purpose of a government-owned central system would be
authentification of transactions. (Do you /really/ trust Vassily Ovaraidt?)
If Uncle Sam puts his stamp on it, the transaction is probably real - and
few will twitch at the .05 percent service charge. This can be valuable even
if you're in England and buying a bicycle from the shop across town.
Build it, and they will come running from every corner of the Earth - /if/
we can somehow guarantee that we won't snitch to the home boss. The only way
to do that is to design absolute anonymity into the system from the ground
up, and eliminate our own mechanism - the IRS - for tracking incomes. That's
being discussed right now, on both the Democratic and Republican sides of
the fence, because it's far from clear that American's hate anything - even
poor Bill Clinton - worse than the IRS.
No really new technology is involved. Public key certificate authorization
can do it; see Schneier's /Advanced Cryptography/ [sic]. Money from all over
the world would flood into the system, generating direct benefits from
revenues levied on the the transfer, and then indirect benefits of foreign
cash invested in a U.S. that doesn't snoop.
This system really doesn't favor the rich against the poor. Why? Because it
taxes the /velocity/ of money - and the rich's money moves around a lot more
than the poor's. By that I mean that a guy who buys a chicken at Safeway
pays one tax one time, but a rich guy's money chases all over the world
looking for the highest return. Freed from physical constraints and
regulation, that money could move from one place to another a couple of
times a day, and anonymously drop .05 percent in the government's hands at
each transfer. Want to lower your taxes? Leave your moeny in one place for
longer periods of time.
I would bet that we wouldn't need anything like the 20 percent replacement
Federal sales tax now being discussed; we would be taxing the total cash
flow of most fo the world's supply of rich guys. In fact, after a year or
two, we might not need to levy a federal sales tax on own citizens at all.
Sure, it's devilish. The harder other governments squeezed their people, the
richer America would grow. Whole governments would fall. Freedom and privacy
would be required for a foreign government to compete. In other words, we
would save the world. If I live to see that, I don't much care what else I

@_subject: crypto-stegonography? 
I got to thinking about crypto and stego, and wondered if it wouldn't
conceivably be a useful technique to marry crypto and stego in the following
manner (probably thought of before :-):
1> encrypt a message in the Usual Manner.
2> by prior arrangement with the other party (or parties, more on that in a
moment), select a random character that has a bit position value equal to a
bit in the encrypted message. That is, if the first bit of your encrypted
message was a '0', randomly select a character that had a '0' in a specific
bit position (say, bit 3). repeat for remainder of message.
3> transmit said message, mimicing any one of a number of formats.
I think such a scheme would have a number of benefits, in that it could
_conceivably_ support up to 8 recipients (8 different messages encrypted
independently), though 6 would probably be a practical limit. The message
could easily be formatted to resemble a uuencoded image or almost anything
else (with minimal prior arrangement). It maintains real encryption while
providing a considerable 'distractor' effect on an opponent (ie, the old
magician's trick of "watch this hand while I do the real stuff with the
other one" :-). With the same message sent to multiple recipients, the
_apparent_ harmlessness of the message would seem to increase, as well.
For a single recipient, the bandwidth requirements really sucks rocks, but
for multiple recipients, the efficiency goes *way* up.
As observed, this has probably been thought of before, but I'd be interested
in hearing any comments....

It sounds like a fairly decent idea, _as long as you shield the bejeebers
(technical term :-) out of it_. Otherwise, anybody with a signal generator
could skew your numbers however they saw fit: any component lead can act as
an antenna, no matter now small that lead is.
One way to handle it would be to lay it out as a multi-layer PCB, with the
signal & power traces inside, and ground plane on the outer layers. Then
enclose the circuit components inside a shielding enclosure (mu-metal would
be good) mounted to the PCB, then tuck the entire assembly inside another
enclosure (small aluminum box for example, also connected to ground).
Of course, there would be easier ways to fabricate it, but they would just
make the shielding that much more difficult to implement.

Even with the exclusion of processors using single-source clocking for
interval and CPU timing, this would *seem* to be somewhat hazardous. Any two
clocking mechanisms that are 'mixed' are going to result in a number of
harmonics, or beat frequencies. While your system - at any given instant -
is quite likely to have a decent amount of randomness in it, I'd hazard a
guess that repetitive use would result in a discernible pattern. Even
something as 'coarse' as an interrupt timer has a finite range that it can
(must) operate in. Even if the CPU oscillator is based on a ceramic
resonator (nowhere near as stable/accurate as a crystal), the clock on it is
going to stay within +/-1% (worst case, for a *really* cheap oscillator) of
frequency, and drift not more than some number of Parts Per Million per
Period. Mixing the innate (relative) accuracy of two oscillators, and the
necessarily limited amount of drift that they're capable of, would seem to
result in an unacceptably low-yield source of 'real' randomness.
Of course, I'm kind of math-impaired when it comes to crypto, so my 20+
years of electronics (hardware) experience may not apply in this case :-)

If RSA made toasters...
           They'd tell you the price *only* after finding out how much toast
you wanted to make and how badly you wanted the toast; then they'd insist on
you making a piece of toast for them every time you used the toaster.
        If cypherpunks made toasters...
           Jim B and Black Unicorn would argue about whether toast should be
buttered, and what the appropriate flavor of jam/jelly should be; TC May
would point out that it wasn't really toast, but rather, sliced and
slightly-burned bread; Perry would kvetch about the lack of crypto-relevance
of toasters; and a few others would form a new listserver for toasterpunks.
The service department would be flooded with calls from newbies, asking how
to make toast.
        If Netscape made toasters...
           They'd beta-test the toasters for months, then make one slot too
wide and the other too narrow. It wouldn't be until a cook in a diner
pointed out that the toast wasn't coming out right that they'd have their
design reviewed by a 3rd-party Toaster Engineer.
        If Microsoft made toasters...
           They'd put the slots on the side, the actuator on top, make the
cord too short, and design it to only run properly on 177V, 41Hz. Then
they'd declare the toaster to be the new industry standard.

@_subject: Digital postage and remailer abuse 
Thus bespoke Alan Bostick:
Doing something like this might also further the analogy of email to
snailmail; particularly if the remailers were able to issue 'books' of stamps.
It might even be possible to have each remailer issue Estamps (tm) of
different 'kinds', much as there are different postage stamp 'themes'.
Having different stamps from each remailer would also allow some means of
tracking spammers and rip-off artists ("hmmm. an 'Elvis' Estamp. That came
from hactic; let's see if they can tell us who they sold this book to.....")
IF the nature of the offense were sever enough.
Too, Estamp-based remailers would be a start on reputation basing: if the
email goes through a postage-based remailer, there will eventually be an
increased level of confidence that it isn't some kind of scam or other
nuisance ("This came through vox, a postage remailer; therefore, someone had
to go through some degree of bother; therefore, it's a lot less likely that
it's some Frosh playing with his new Internet toy.").
Of course, I could be just spitting into the wind, or posting what is
blatantly obvious to everyone else :-)

requirement, simply a means of resolving a *significant* problem. Or not. :-)

Article of that title in Jan 22 issue of EE Times:
"San Francisco - IBM subsidiary Lotus Development Corp. offered an olive branch of sorts to the National Security Agency (NSA) last week, at the opening of the RSA Data Security Conference at the Fairmont Hotel. The Iris Associates unit of Lotus that developed Lotus Notes will be able to ship an international version with the equivalent [!!] of 64-bit encryption, using a concept Lotus calls "Differential Workfactor Cryptography".
In the past, NSA has blocked the State Department from issuing broad licenses for packages with encryption of 40 bits or stronger. The Business Software Alliance argues that this has jeopardized sales of U.S. software overseas. The NSA has unsuccessfully tried to get U.S. manufacturers to use the Clipper chip or its software equivalent (based on a classified encryption algorithm) or an unclassified "key escrow" algorithm in which decryption keys must be held by third parties. OEMs have rejected all key-escrow concepts and have demanded international export rights for public-key cryptography methods promoted by vendors such as RSA.
Lotus's compromise with the NSA concedes the agency's right to conduct signals intelligence on foreign targets. The encryption in Notes Release 4 is based on a 64-bit random number. But for the exported version of Release 4, the NSA generates a public-key algorithm and encrypts 24 bits of the key using the public RSA key. The result of this operation, the Workfactor Reduction Field [!?], is bound to the encrypted data. Foreign hackers will find the encrypted messages as difficult to decrypt as a message with a 64-bit RSA key, but the NSA will find it as easy to crack as a message with a 40-bit key."

- From 29 Jan edition of EE Times, P 24:
"Aix-en-Provence, France - A startup formed here to capitalize on the interest in cryptographic smart cards has won an assignment that could help put its name on the data-security map. The company, Inside Technologies, has been selectedby the Open Microprocessor Systems Initiative (OMI) to do the combo-chip layout for OMI's Cryptographic Reduced Instruction Set Processor (Crisp) project."
"'In public-key cryptography, 512-bit keys are typical and already vulnerable. So we are looking at 640-bit-long keys supported by a scalable design' said [IT partnet William Orme]. He said that conventional smart-card ICs tend to be based on available 8-bit microcontrollers and, sometimes, cryptographic processors.
Because it iss designed specifically for smart-card applications, the 8-bit RISC processor will require only 2,500 gates. Conventional crypto coprocessors tend to support only one type of algroithm, such as Rivest, Shamir, Adleman (RSA) or the Data Encryption Standard (DES).
Orme said that by designing the CLU at a lower level of granularity, multiplies and squaring operations, calculations can be built up in the form of building blocks and can support a variety of algroithms adn key lengths. 'Users want their own, custom algrotihms, which can be downloaded at the time of use', he said.
The CLU should support RSA, DES, and the Digital Signature Standard (DSS). RSA optimization will cover 320-, 512-, and 640-bit key lengths.
'The CLU will operate at a higher clock frequency than the RISC - 60 MHz, in our design - yielding 640-bit RSA decrypt in less than 50mS', Orme said."

I and a partner are expecting to be online by the 8th of March with a commercial web server (shellback.com).
As part of this presence, I am working on hacking together a program to interface with the SLMail95 (yes, it will be running on a Win95 machine :-) email server to allow operation as a remailer. Initially, I anticipate that it will be a fairly 'dumb' remailer, offering only remailing, reordering, and PGP encryption. Additional CP-style features will be added as my time to implement them permits.
I am offering to maintain an initially limited archives of CP materials and a listserve host (if needed/wanted). I am also actively soliciting (via email to me personally, please, and forgive me if I don't acknowledge it) pointers and materials (files, documents, etc) to include on the site. I have the PGP files from the CP ftp site (before it got 'lost' again), but anything else is *most* welcome.
We will also be offering anonymous email accounts for $5/month.
Following is the PGP key for the remailer we'll be operating (remailer at shellback.com). I want to emphasize that the remailer will *not* keep *any* kind of logs. Bad headers, bounces, or anything else not processed on the first go-through will simply fall into the bitbucket for electron recycling. Since I'll be the postmaster/webmaster, I can say that with no small measure of confidence :-)

I'm ready to start testing my Win95 remailer hack. I'd appreciate a *few* anon messages with my webmaster (_not_ remailer) address as an intermediary: webmaster at shellback.com vs. remailer at shellback.com
Messages don't have to contain anything important, since they will _not_ be sent on. A PGP-encrypted message or two in the mix would be Really Nice.

@_subject: Win95 Remailer beta 
I've finally managed to get my hack at a Win95-based remailer done. I've settled on RemailerBot for a name, an this will be version .9b(eta). It isn't pretty, and there isn't a whole lot of functionality to it yet (remailing, reorder, automagically kills subject lines, handles both anon-to and request-remailing-to). But at least it's *something*; I'll start adding to it ASAP. I'll have the (_heavily_ commented)  source (written in VB4 Pro, heh) available on my web page in a day or two (probably need to figure on Monday :-). Anyone wants it before then, email me and I'll zip it up and email it to you (state your preference for MIME or uuencoding).
Many thanks to the kind folks who sent 'anonymous mail' to me via my webmaster identity so that I'd have some 'real' remailer messages to play with.
Brief description of it is that it reads what Seattle Labs software (purveyors of SLMail95) assures me is a 'standard unix' .mbx file, separates it into component messages, processes them, and dumps the results into an outbox directory. It deletes (not wipes [yet]) any intermediate files. Wiping isn't a big priority (I think) because of Win95's System Agent which can run a defrag utility periodically.
My feature priorities are PGP first, followed by latency, then the rest. If there's anyone out there that can read VB source _and_ knows what a .mbx file really looks like, I'd appreciate having a cross-check on my parsing. Right now, it's SLMail-specific, and I'd like to be able to make sure it can handle a little more variety.

It replaces the remailer.zip available through my web page.
Simply unzip it to the directory of your choice, and run the setup132.exe file. Alternatively, you can use the MS expand utility to uncompress selective files.

@_subject: MS self-generated X.509 validity? 
I've just had a chance to go through the SDK MS is giving away for their
ActiveX package. Interestingly, there's a little utility included for
generating X.509 certs. The read.me that is included claims that the certs
so generated don't have any real validity, as they're not linked to anything
in the known universe (paraphrasing :-).
My question is, is this an otherwise usable cert? I'll be happy to give
anyone interested a copy of the files (shellback.cer and shellback.spc) I
generated, if they'd like to examine/validate them.
If the certs are, in fact, valid, I'll be glad to make the program available
to others for 'testing purposes'.

@_subject: Let's *NOT* "Raise their Awareness" 
Regrettably, I must disagree with Mr. May on the matter of speaking in
whatever language one chooses. It seems that here in Texas (specifically,
here in Amarillo), a local judge informed a Hispanic family that they were
prohibited from speaking _only_ Spanish to their child at home. The
rationale was that since English is the (ostensibly, in this area) Public
Language of the school system here, failure to encourage use of English
would adversely impact the child's education, and was thus a form of child
abuse. If need be, I can provide excerpts from the local snoozepapers
coverage of the issue.

@_subject: Why Americans feel no compulsion to learn foreign languages 
Indeed, I've found that pretty much covers the essentials :-)
First things I've always tried to learn in a foreign language are "please"
and "thank you".
Sounds much similar to the reaction I got in Japan, speaking broken
Japanese. Atrocious accent, of course; abysmal grammar, and a fair share of
mispronunciation tossed in - but I was *trying*, and that counted for a _lot_.
I also have to concur with the point about the language/point-of-view
argument. I never have learned to _think_ in a foreign language (a
prerequisite for fluency, I believe :-), but have gotten sufficiently
skilled to be able to understand some of the subtleties of the languages
I've (kind of) learned.
Regarding the notoriety of British (and, yes, Americans), I met up with a
Brit in Japan who complained about the 'bloody foreigners that don't
understand proper English'. I pointed out to him that *we* were the
foreigners, and that the Japanese had a nicely organized society about the
same time that his ancestors and mine were still smearing themselves with
blue mud. That earned me an Evil Look.

@_subject: java security 
I wonder if it's possible to _subvert_ Java. That is, have site "A" send
along some modifications to a Java class, so that when the user logs into
site "B" (which calls that class), Nasty Things Happen. What site "A" does
raises no alarm flags _until_ site "B" trips the trigger - making it look
like site "B" is the Bad Guy.
(WARNING! CDA Violation!) Hell, you might even be able to spread the
modifications around some, so that it's even less obvious where they were
done. Maybe even use the technique to modify Java itself, thus disabling
security controls.
