@_subject: Using Thermite to Drop Suspension Bridges...and U.S. plans 
There are various formulations for thermite.  The one I like best uses barium peroxide, sulphur and very finely divided aluminum (paint pigment works great).  Thermite is nice cause its not explosive or shock sensitive and can be ignited by a simple green fireworks fuse.
