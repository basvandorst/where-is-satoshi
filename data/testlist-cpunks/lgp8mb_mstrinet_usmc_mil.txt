Message not delivered to recipients below.  Press F1 for help with VNM
error codes.               VNM3043 -- MAILBOX IS FULL
   The message cannot be delivered because the
   recipient's mailbox contains the maximum number of    messages, as set by the system administrator.  The
   recipient must delete some messages before any
   other messages can be delivered.
    The maximum message limit for a user's mailbox is    10,000.  The default message limit is 1000 messages.     Administrators can set message limits using the    Mailbox  Settings function available in the    Manage User menu  (MUSER).    When a user's mailbox reaches the limit, the    user must delete some of the messages before    the mailbox can accept any more incoming messages.

The only problem is there has to be someway for users to retrieve their mail.
The current nym server approach is to use an encrypted reply block to send a
user new mail.  This way the nym server doesn't know who the user is.  If users
have to actively retrieve their mail, then the feds could install a packet
sniffer on the remailers net link to find out the real email address of an
anonymous user.
