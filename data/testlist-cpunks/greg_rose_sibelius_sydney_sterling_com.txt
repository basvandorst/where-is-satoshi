Wow -- hooks to encryption are unexportable -- now THAT's bullshit.  Sheesh.
A few yuears ago I asked Matt Blaze if he would
publish CFS with the sryptography removed, and he
told me that AT&T's lawyers also believed this to
be true. (So, of course, his answer was "No".)
The hooks are as important as the crypto code.
Interestingly though, Kerberos made it to
Australia (Bond University I think) legally.

Wow, you learn something every day. I've never in
my whole life (well, my American Express life,
over 15 years) noticed those four digits. I've
never been asked for them by anyone, or noticed
them being written down, either. Exactly when and
how are they used?

The printed digits above the embossed account number are the first four
  digits of the BIN (on Visa cards) or ICA (on MasterCards). They are there
  to discourage re-embossing of the card with another account number.
True for Visa cards, but false for the AMEX. On my
two Amex cards there is no obvious relationship
between the four digit number and the embossed
card number.

@_subject: PGP Moose anti-spam authentication ready to go 
Yesterday the PGP Moose Checking Daemon did its
first automatic cancellation. The offending message
lasted less than a second.
For some months I've been working on some scripts
collectively called "the PGP Moose", which are
intended to cryptographically authenticate news
postings, and send notifications or cancellations
when postings fail the authentication. This message
is to announce that the moderators' and users' end
of the software seems to be ready to go, and I'm
looking for testers who have a better and more
complete newsfeed than I to cooperate with running
the cancelling daemon part of it. Both parts are
tested to the best of my ability.
The aim of this software is to monitor the news
postings of moderators of USENET newsgroups, and to
automatically cancel forged messages purporting to
be approved.  This can be extended to the approvals
of individual users to automatically cancel messages
that appear without having been authorised by the
user. This has (obviously) been prompted by the
recent spammings and other events.
This software and protocol is designed around
cryptographic signatures.  The protocol is designed
to allow the use of different signature techniques.
This implemention assumes the use of PGP signatures,
but can be easily modified to use others, such as
the Digital Signature Standard.  PGP was chosen for
its widespread availability around the world.
Basically, there is a script you run which
inserts a special header based on a PGP signature
of the important parts of the article. When an
article arrives at a site running the PGP Moose
Checking Daemon, the existence and correctness
of this special header are checked, and either
someone is notified or the article is cancelled.
PGP, the crux of the cryptographic software, was
written by Phil Zimmermann , who
otherwise has nothing to do with this. The cryptographic
framework was written by me ,
as were the INN news system hooks.
The README
is available for browsing, so I won't post it here,
but I will happily send it (or the scripts) to people
who can't get it easily on the Web.

and Kari asked:
  >Maybe you could name those experts who have inspected it - thanks.
  Um, in an earlier post she mentioned the venerable Mr. Kahn and
  someone else whose name I forget.
I noted at the time that I didn't know any of the
names, except Kahn, and only later realised that
this is the Kahn who wrote the book, not the Karn
who is a cryptographer. I don't know whether David
Kahn actually has any credentials at all as a
cryptographer. Does anyone else?
Note I'm not trying to discredit Elementrix POTP,
and especially not David Kahn who wrote a very
important book.

@_subject: San Diego Cypherpunks Physical Meeting 
Don't forget to bring your public key  fingerprint.  If you can figure
  out how to get it on the back of a business card, that would be cool.  This isn't so hard. See below. Unless you have a
somewhat longer name and email address than me,
you can print a page full of them and cut them up.
Basically all I did was edit the output of pgp -kvc to split the first line into two, and remove many
of the blanks from the fingerprint. Then
cut-and-paste in the editor to put two copies per
line. Then five copies of the lines. Then print it
at 9.5 point (most people could probably use 10
point, but "Greg Rose "
is longer than a business card in 10 point
courier). I see that Chris's (presumed) PGP key
wouldn't fit, but vertically speaking you have
plenty of room for two keys, and could wrap the
name and email parts onto two lines.
The parameters to the lpr command are for HP/UX,
in case anyone is wondering. This way I just run
the script, rather than having to remember how to
get it printed.
Hope that helps,
