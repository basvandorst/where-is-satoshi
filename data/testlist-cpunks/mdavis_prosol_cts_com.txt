[useful content deleted]
This is my first post here, so go easy if I'm way off base.  Why would
you want to include a PGP signature (in addition to your net .signature)
for a message that is NOT encoded?  I've included the pageful of useless
text from your message as an example of how wasteful this seems to me.
I'm all for personal privacy and message security, but this smacks of
either paranoia, showing off, or laziness.  Genuinely curious.

@_subject: Thanks for the enlightenment 
Let me thank all of those who set me straight on the PGP signature stuff.
I got about half a dozen messages that politely educated me on the use of
PGP secured messages.  (This also served as a test to make sure our news
program is properly interfacing with this mailing list -- and it is.)

@_subject: If the cypherpunks list gets this, the loop is at pro-sol.cts.com 
No.  Our local list alias is "cypherpunks-list" and the only recipient is an
incoming news processor that posts messages in a local newsgroup
(pro.cypherpunks).  The only transmissions to the cypherpunks at toad.com
address are when posts are made in our local newsgroup.
I will double-check everything though.

@_subject: Secured E-mail standard? 
Has a proposal been made to officially adopt a header field in standard
Internet mail messages that would essentially include security signature
information?  Something like:
        X-Security-Type: PGP 1.0
        X-Security-Code: asdui&Dh1daOFajsFNOA...etc.
These generic field names would allow for various types of security methods.
Most important, would make it a lot easier for smart e-mail systems to
recognize secured e-mail, with the option of allowing the user to filter
out such fields when reading text.  The current scheme of having to
"frame" the content (plain text) and add the PGP signature is distracting.

Orwell was probably right, but some editor went in and changed the title to
1984.  If only Orwell had PGP back then...  :-)

@_subject: Clipper is now Skipjack 
This is crazy.  Is anyone (i.e. corporations) really going to use Skipjack?
Or will they be forced to use it in order to service government/military
contracts that require "Skipjack Security"?
If I had to trust my company's data to an encryption scheme, it would be
one where only I knew the key to decode it, not "five selected people"
(and the rest of government, and any agencies they wished to share my
data with).
