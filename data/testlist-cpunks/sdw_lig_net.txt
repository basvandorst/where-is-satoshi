@_subject: Copyright enforcement through crypto 
I'd like to explore the technical problems of enforcing copyright restrictions through encryption and custom viewing software.
What I have in mind is a viewer, say a spin off of Mosaic, that has
a general purpose decryption engine that could be programmed with an
algorythm as part of the document download process.  The goal I have
in mind is to make possible one time, or limited time viewing of a
downloaded document  The document would be encrypted with the selected
method and keyed with a timestamp.  The client would need access to a
timeserver and a session key, etc. to decrypt as close as possible to
the display hardware.
This could be prototyped as a user process, but securely implemented
as an extension to X, MS-Windows, etc.
I haven't worked out all the problems, but see quite a few already.
Obviously, the goal would be to get really good copyright material on
the net, like first run movies, when we have the bandwidth.
Just wondering what minimum collection of hardware, software, and
infrastructure would be needed.  Of course, this is related to the
pay-per-use software paradigm (vs. current unlimited license).

@_subject: Copyright enforcement through crypto 
Yesyes, you're preaching to the choir.  I want information to be free
too, etc.
It just occurred to me that by tying the decryption to a time server
and sending both the timebased key and a complete algorithm to a general purpose engine that you might get something somewhat effective.
To give an example:
12 years ago I worked in a computer store that sold Atari computers.
I learned to program on my Atari 400, cassete, Basic, assembly, etc.
I used to have fun 'breaking' the copy protection on game floppies.
There were some sophisticated methods that a number of companies used,
but I could eventually disassemble and follow the code and patch it.
(Blue Max was the hardest I cracked: 5 stage load, several
multi-sector-with-same-number-same-track protections, and executing
code merged from two such sectors).
The one disk that I couldn't crack (and I still have it) was the ABC
Basic compiler.  The compiler was compiled with itself.  Since the
assembly was just a general purpose engine, I had to follow the
p-code/tokenized Basic all over the place.  I could never keep track
of it long enough to solve it.
If an algorithm is only good for a perticular copy of a document and
only for a short time, the theoretical possibility of cracking it
becomes harder.
I want to explore what aspects can be solved and what can't.
Obviously you can always take a picture of the screen, possibly
capture data in the window/operating system, etc.  But, with
a modifed X, unmodified OS, etc., how close can you get.
Unless each document uses it's own key and randomly selected
algorithm(s) and needs online access.
Of course, that's always a problem, unless things are priced per use
so that it's more attractive to pay.
Of course, I didn't say it was necessary...  Just musing how effective
it would be.
I agree.
Come on guys, I don't post that much, but you need to crank up your
Devil's Advocate detectors.  Geesh, doesn't anyone like a good

I would like some summary opinions of the state of various efforts to

After playing with ssh, I've been thinking of what it would take to
start migrating certain links to full encryption, possibly using a
VPN-like arrangement.
I'm interested in hacking Linux, loopback userspace drivers for other Unix's,
and thinking about what would need to be done for MS-BLECH.  Of course,
firewall like conversion of IP<->IPng6 would be great.
Of course now that Linux has IP aliasing, IP masquerading (partial I think),
ipfw, and IP over IP tunneling, it has much of what it needs.  I'm just
considering development and migration paths.
I haven't kept up on IPng6 docs, so succinct pointers would be helpful.
One interesting tact might be to start running a dual IPng6/IP stack
where it learns to tunnel packets over a well-known IP udp/tcp link
if an address doesn't respond to IPng6.

Not only that but it's common now for DNS servers to give short TTL
for the answers (multiple A recs for load balancing), no big deal

I believe the root servers answers for intermediate nodes are cached
normally, so key.george.bub.com doesn't cause a root hit after
bub.com has been resolved.
Quite a few domains do run their own name servers, and it's not too tough
to create auto-update scripts, etc.
There's no reason that DNS has to be the only mechanism.  Default
to one method then fallback to others, like direct IP port connection
for query.

It should have minimize bandwidth, minimize cpu, minimize storage
levels of service to allow different levels of users to have
different possible impact on the machine.  (Ie. : local, paying,

I know that those of us running Internet services would devote

Both of these could be modified fairly easily.
I think Twinsock (Troy's winsock, twnsck12.zip) would be the first

It also should tunnel through multiple telnets since by default it escapes

@_subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: Ssh (Secure Shell) remote login program 
I think we've all been waiting for / building this.
ssh, while an obvious name, already collides with a nice shar decoder and
a different kind of secure shell from CFS.
Probably a worthwhile collision though.
Second: It would be very helpful if the socket connection could be made (optionally)
through a telnet proxy for firewalls (with optional quoting of problem
characters).  I've actually done this with TERM and a helper program.
I may produce a patch for this.
Of course support for S/Key and tokens/hand held authenticators would be
useful additions for some situations (although inferior to RSA...).
Someone needs to crank out a Windows/Mac client... (Lower priority, but
still useful.)
udprelay etc. could also be borrowed from the term suite.
Integration with TCP/NFS and/or client-server CFS would be fantastic.
(One local CFS server acting as a secure client over tcp to a remote
CFS server.)

@_subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: Ssh (Secure Shell) remote login program 
I agree as the collisions aren't too bad (except in my /usr/local/bin...).
I was actually contemplating a modification to CFS to support a
tunneled TCP based NFS related operation.
CFS, like other specialized NFS servers, talks to NFS clients like
the normal NFS server, but runs on a different RPC port (so you can
run several types of NFS servers).  CFS encrypts directories that can be attached and detached without changing the NFS mount.
It occurred to me that it wouldn't be too tough to have one CFSD
open a TCP/socket connection to another CFSD and pass file access
requests instead of implementing them locally.  The encryption
of the ssh link and the on disk encryption of CFSD should be a good combination.
I've been compiling under Linux and have had a number of autoconfiguration
errors.  I'll produce a simple-minded patch shortly.
(Thinks I'm cross-compiling, have some include files I don't, don't
have waitpid/wait3, collision with stdc crypt/random defs, etc.)

That's true.  I was thinking in terms of traversing firewalls in a
safe fashion rather than where normal SUN/RPC NFS is available.
For this, using CFS and SSH together seems appropriate.

*** Help on ENCRYPT
Usage: ENCRYPT [| []]
  ENCRYPT allows you to hold an encrypted conversations with
  a person or a whole channel.  Once a nickname/channel and
  key is specified, all messages you send to that
  nickname/channel will automatically be encrypted using the
  given key.  Likewise, any messages from that nickname/channel
  will automatically be decrypted. ircII is smart enough to know
  if the incoming message isn't encrypted and will not attempt to
  decrypt it.  If you received an encrypted message from someone
  for whom you haven't specified a key, it will be displayed as
  [ENCRYPTED MESSAGE].
  The  can be any text which is to be used an they key
  for encryption/decryption of the conversation.  It is up to
  you and the people you wish to talk to about how to agree upon
  a key and how to communicate it to one another.
  For example, if user CheeseDog wishes to talk encryptedly with
  user DogCheese, they must first agree on an encryption key
  (case sensitive), say foo.  Then user CheeseDog must issue a
    ENCRYPT DogCheese foo
  and user DogCheese must issue a
    ENCRYPT CheeseDog foo
  Thereafter, all messages sent between CheeseDog and DogCheese
  will be encrypted and decrypted automatically.
  If ENCRYPT is given with a nickname but no key, then encrypted
  conversation is ended with that user.  If ENCRYPT is given with
  no arguments, the list of encrypted user and keys are
  displayed.
  IrcII uses a built in encryption method that isn't terribly secure.
  You can use another if you so choose, see SEE ENCRYPT_PROGRAM
  for information about this.
  If you are sending encrypted messages to a user or channel, you
  can toggle it off and on in a message line by inserting the
  control-E character in the input line.  This is usually done
  by hitting control-Q then control-E.  An inverse video E will
  appear in the input line.
  Control-q is bound (see BIND) to quote_character by default.
  It is frequently necessary to change this to some other char.
See Also:
  SET ENCRYPT_PROGRAM
*** You have new email.
*** No help available on encrypt_program: Use ? for list of topics
*** Help on ENCRYPT_PROGRAM
Usage: SET ENCRYPT_PROGRAM   Sets the program used to encrypt and decrypt messages.  The

In any case, using SIGIO is a whole parallel method to using a select loop,

has some elegance since they chain to other possible signal handlers in

That's not necessarily true:
I could setup a web server to only listen to a socket that a local ssh
socket proxy could connect to.  Restrict the ssh session for a particular
key to only allow connection to that one socket.  Then the connecting
party would need ssh running with socket proxy near(er) their client
system and the public key.
Assuming that you have a Unix workstation with audio listening software
or a nearby PC it would be easy to setup.

I have a neighbor that develops one of the commercial TCP/IP stacks, so
it's quite possible I could convince him to help.
With things like ssh, it's already very easy to create secure tunnels.
It wouldn't be too tough to modify a proxy to use ssh style connections
if an initial connection was found to be encrypted (or a key was cached
for a URL).
Of course, IPsec is coming...

By James Popkin, NBC News Senior Investigative Correspondent
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is reminding law-enforcement officials of the increased use of female suicide bombers worldwide, and warning that women terrorists might hide explosives in devices bthat mimic the look of a pregnant woman.b
The unclassified DHS threat assessment, released Monday and obtained by NBC News, shows photographs of bpregnancy prosthetics,b hollowed-out devices that could hold explosive devices. The report says bfemale suicide bombers have used devices that make them appear pregnant to hide explosive devices.b
The DHS report states that terrorists are using female bombers more frequently, in part because these attacks generate bmore widespread media exposure.b It adds: bContinued use of female suicide bombers-the most recent example being a 3 February 2008 attack at the main railway station in Colombo, Sri Lanka-indicates that terrorists judge this tactic as effective in increasing defenses and thwarting security measures.b
The report, marked bFor Official Use Only,b is one of dozens of threat assessments issued jointly throughout the year by DHS and the FBI. The authors are quick to mention that therebs no immediate threat to the U.S.
bDHS and the FBI have no specific, credible intelligence indicating that terrorist organizations intend to utilize female suicide bombers against targets in the Homeland,b they write.
The report ticks off several recent attacks by women bombers in Iraq and Sri Lanka, and the recruitment of female suicide bombers in Chechnya, India, Pakistan, the Palestinian territories and Turkey.
Why the increase in women bombers? bDHS and the FBI assess that female suicide bombers may have an advantage over their male counterparts in accessing targets. The means to conduct a suicide attack vary widely, but a key element in maximizing the lethality of a suicide bombing is the bomberbs ability to get close to the target,b the report states. bFemale suicide bombers may carry explosives devices in a backpack, briefcase, or purse, or hidden in an article of clothing worn close to the body, such as a vest, belt, long socks, or jacket.b

Can you write up a spec for that?  A few lines of code?
There are a couple main types of use cases for this kind of capability:
A) emergency situations of various types like the Egypt blackout and
B) getting communication and sharing working in more misc. ambient conditions (poor coverage in a building, on the train, etc.).
There is a big use case for this that will give it a workout that is sort of a simulation of the first of these and with a good need for the second: Burning Man.  Many people in a refugee-like camp, no commercial wireless or land line, a desire to communicate in various ways, a high percentage of techies with smart phones, all running an experiment for a week.  Seems like a perfect testing ground.  We have 6 months to be ready.

Chons - "Egyptian god of light in the night... he also held the titles Embracer, Pathfinder, and Defender, as he was thought to watch over night travelers. As the god of light in the night, Chons was invoked to protect against wild animals, increase male virility, and to aid with healing."
chons.org is now registered.  Now, how is it pronounced??
There has been plenty of work with open source cell networks, etc.  I haven't seen anything usable about hand-held mesh and/or store and forward capability yet.  Ideally, you'd use bluetooth when in close proximity, with Wifi / cell for uplink, with Wifi also being used for wider proximity connections.  The store and forward capability could be kind of cool.  Limit it to SMS-like messages, enforce flow control, then floodcast, possibly with fuzzy geo-routing, as necessary for both unicast and broadcast messages.  Get all roving vehicles to run store and forward nodes.  Include time synchronization, then implement radio control for prairie dog activation for both battery conservation and channel The biggest hurdle will be security, including detecting and defeating jamming and spoofing of various types.
I'm most interested in an Android solution that will work on most devices.  Not only are they easier to hack, more open, easier to run untrusted apps, etc., but some of us are building a collection of obsolete devices that would be cool to use for this.

@_subject: [FoRK] Decentralizing the Internet So Big Brother Canbt Find You 
I was really interested in Plug Computers a year or two ago, and I have a couple development units.  For this kind of application, it seems that a certain range of applications, like personal servers and remote access to archives, is obvious (and there is an "app plug computer" for that, about $100).  For really solving the decentralized problem, you'd want to pair it with mesh communications.  I see several possibilities.  Wifi-Wifi would be great, but there are antenna and power issues in many cases.  Wifi-cellphone-picocell is more interesting because cell phones already can make significantly more distance than typical WiFi.  This is also interesting if you add in resilient routing / store and forward / dynamic multi-modal addressing (including geo).  Ideally, you can cover any distance and gaps for at least some transmission, and great transmission when possible, by opportunistically hitching a ride on any device to any device proximity.
These devices (plug computers, smart phones, picocells, wifi base stations, bluetooth, zigbee) are inexpensive and low power enough that they could be just about everywhere.  Every vehicle, street light / signal, business, person, and even important street surfaces and similar could be wirelessed with an open, cooperative, protocol.  Doing it while controlling abuse and  making use fair is the problem.
The biggest hard problem is probably preventing bombing by e-signal.  Some possible solutions: A) blackout in appropriate conditions (hard to prevent abuse of) and B) super-tracing / persistent following after the fact when a bad event happens and enough people vote for extreme transparency.  In other words, detect the explosion or whatever, people hit the panic button, and every possible trigger is tracked back to a likely source and those sources are tracked for some time using all methods.
There are a number of obvious apps for this kind of network: shotspotter (a la Bump) for all devices.  Person-aware (what I mentioned yesterday a la traffic safety to prevent hitting children and animals in congested traffic areas).  Emergency service / help expediting.

Hollywood whodunit: What's eating emails in iCloud?
A reader in show biz writes in with a puzzle: His iCloud attachments aren't coming through -- perhaps by Apple's design
By Robert X. Cringely | InfoWorld
Here's a mystery worthy of a Hollywood thriller.
I recently got an email from a reader named Steven G., an Academy Award-winning developer of screenplay-writing software used by major movie honchos. Steven told me his customers had been encountering a bizarre issue with Apple's iCloud service.
[ Apple's control freak tendencies go back a long way. Witness: The 7 words you can't say on iTunes. | For a humorous take on the tech industry's shenanigans, subscribe to Robert X. Cringely's Notes from the Underground newsletter. | Get the latest insight on the tech news that matters from InfoWorld's Tech Watch blog. ]
A screenwriter was delivering a PDF attachment of a draft of his script to the project's director, by emailing it from his iCloud/MobileMe account to Gmail. The problem? The script would never arrive, no matter how many times he would send it. But sending other PDF documents worked fine.
I figured, wow -- is this some sort of spectacular failure of our screenwriting software (Movie Magic Screenwriter)? Our software had generated the PDF, so maybe we had accidentally generated information that was somehow matching the profile of a virus, or malware, causing the document to be rejected by Apple's mail servers.
After obtaining a copy of the PDF (sent via Gmail to our Microsoft Exchange server), we confirmed the exact same behavior when we tried to send it to our own iCloud mailbox. The email never arrived, nor did we receive any return notification.
He began experimenting to find out what was going on. First, he compressed the screenplay PDF into a Zip file and sent that. It also disappeared. Next, he compressed it using Apple's encrypted archive format. That attachment made it through, but it came with an unusual comment: "[not Virus Scanned]" appended to the subject field.
flagged and flushed. He cut the file in half and sent the first 59 pages as an attachment. It got deleted. His breakthrough arrived, in dramatic Hollywood fashion:
AND THEN I SAW IT -- a line in the script, describing a character viewing an advertisement for a pornographic site on his computer screen. Upon modifying this line, the entire document was delivered with no problem.
It seemed not only was Apple scanning messages for malware, it was also scanning the content of each attachment and exercising some kind of rule about it. Apple wasn't merely flagging the message or sending to a spam folder, but deleting it outright.

Although for a whole drive it would be a bit of an efficient storage use issue (requiring just periodic reset maintenance), SparkleShare+Gitolite git server via ssh is a great combination, with clients for Windows/Macosx/Linux or you can use any git client.  If the git server were storing into a TrueCrypt loopback on the server, you'd ruin offline attacks against your data.  Simply sync to another drive somewhere to get Why not run an ephemeral VM (VirtualBox is free) that mounts a local host TrueCrypt volume that is a cache for SparkleShare/Git.  You could run the VM from the TrueCrypt volume, but then it would be mounted on the local OS and Panopticon-like admin / system software would get to it.  An ephemeral VM (that doesn't save updates to disk) that mounts the TrueCrypt volume is more difficult to attack. This was always a feature of VMWare; not sure how to do it with VirtualBox.  Perhaps with snapshots or similar COW drive  mounts with the drives in the TrueCrypt loopback.
The VM should tunnel all network traffic over SSH to a shell server somewhere, home if you properly setup incoming ports.  Use dynamic DNS to get to it or something simpler (file on the ssh server is enough).
It's not to hard to get the beginnings of cover traffic to make traffic analysis tough.  This could be done various ways from random data, traffic sensing reaction, to a smart tunnel that directly augments traffic patterns with chaff.  Modify netcat and then run that over SSH socket proxies.
I've been running a colocated machine one way or another since 1992, with my own DNS server, etc.  When I get around to building almost-never-fail mini-servers, I have at least two other stable but seldom visited locations to put servers.  I currently have an underused Linux box with 4 large drives and 10Mb symmetric unlimited use.  The hard drive wears out about once every 2 years; it gets rebooted about once every 6-12 months.  It would probably be a good idea to share it and defray some of the costs, especially while I'm in (relative) vow-of-poverty startup mode again.

Fox News' Audience Is Literally Dying: Is Roger Ailes' Grand Experiment in Propaganda Doomed?
There are certain demographic realities that can't be ignored.
April 17, 2013  |
The following article first appeared on the Nation. For more great content, sign up for their newsletter here.
In the annals of Fox News, October 2012 will likely stand out as a shining moment. Buoyed by a wave of Republican optimism about Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, the network seemed tantalizingly close to realizing one of its key ideological goals: ousting President Obama from the White House. Renewed enthusiasm among conservatives was, in turn, triggering record-high ratings for much of the network's programming and helping it to beat not just rival news competitors MSNBC and CNN during prime time, but every other TV channel on the cable dial. What's more, the prospect of an ascendant GOP come January meant Fox News might soon return to the era of access and prestige it enjoyed in Washington during the presidency of George W. Bush. The future looked so bright that News Corporation CEO Rupert Murdoch signed Fox News president Roger Ailes to a lucrative four-year contract extension, even though the 72-year-old Ailes's existing contract wasn't due to expire until 2013.
Then November arrived, and with it reality.
Fox News's shellshocked election night coverage, punctuated by Karl Rove's surreal meltdown upon hearing of Obama's victory in Ohio and, thus, the election, capped off a historic day of reckoning for the network and conservatives alike. Chastened by defeat, Republican politicians and right-wing pundits have subsequently been grappling with the repercussions of the caustic tone and incendiary rhetoric their movement has adopted. This ongoing debate about whether broadening conservatism's appeal  requires new messages or just new messaging has ignored the 800-pound gorilla in the room, however. Noticeably absent from all the right wing's public self-criticism is any interest in confronting the potent role played by the Republican Party's single most important messenger, Fox News.
Standing at the epicenter of the networkband any new Republican Party groundswellbis Ailes. A former political operative of President Richard Nixon, Ailes has inextricably intertwined his professional and political pursuits since founding Fox News in 1996. Indeed, the network chief functions as a kind of proxy kingmaker within the party, frequently meeting with Republican politicians to offer strategic advice. He is a regular confidant of Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, and at various times, he (or a network emissary of his) has counseled 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Gen. David Petraeus on their potential future. "Ailes," says former Reagan White House economic adviser Bruce Bartlett, "is quite open about offering his free advice to Republicans.... If you visit New York City, you go see Roger Ailes and kiss his ring. It's like visiting the Vatican. My guess is that there's a lot of back-and-forth between Ailes and whoever is at the pinnacle of power in the Republican Party."
To keep relying on a shrinking number of elderly, white and male subsets of the public, whether to win elections or win ratings, has become a strategy of diminishing returns, however. "I think that you can't separate the problem at Fox [News] from the problem that the Republicans are going through," Bartlett says. He can speak firsthand to this incestuous relationship, as his 2006 book, Impostorbwhich broke with party orthodoxy over the Bush administration's deficit spendingbquickly made him persona  non grata at Fox News, he says. (Fox News did not respond to questions about his comment.) "The Republicans are trying to retool to win. That's all they care about, and they're trying to decide, 'How can we be more pragmatic? How can we shave off the rough edges? How can we get rid of the whack jobs who are embarrassing us, costing us Senate seats? But at the same time, we can't do this in such a way that it alienates our base.'" Fox News faces a similar dilemma, Bartlett contends: "It's 'How do we  modernize? How do we attract new audiences without losing the old audience? How do we remain relevant without abandoning our traditions?'"
These are fundamental questions, and lately Fox News's b(fundamentalsbaudience, ratings and public trustbhave faltered. A 2010  study by Steve Sternberg found the network's viewership to be the oldest (with an average age of 65) among an already elderly cable news audience. (CNN's was 63 and MSNBC's was 59.) By comparison, lifestyle cable channels Oxygen, Bravo and TLC were among the youngest, with an average viewer age of 42. And with MSNBC's recent decision to plug 34-year-old rising star Chris Hayes into the coveted b(8 pm slot, the average age of that network's prime-time hosts will now be 45, while Fox News's rotation, anchored by 63-year-old Bill O'Reilly, has an average age of 57.
Having cable news's oldest average age for both prime-time hosts and audiences represents something of a double-edged sword for Fox in the cutthroat world of cable TV. One advantage is that older audiences are traditionally more loyal, which is why several industry experts say that Fox News is unlikely to be dislodged from its perch atop overall cable TV news ratings anytime soon. This age-loyalty effect redounds to the benefit of Fox News's best-known prime-time hosts, Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly, as roughly two-thirds of their viewers are age 50 or older, according to a recent Pew State of the News Media survey.
But at the same time, there is an undeniable actuarial reality at workbor as Bartlett bluntly puts it, "Their viewership is quite literally dying." The most lucrative advertising dollars flow to TV shows that attract viewers "in the demo," short for "demographic"bindustry parlance for people ages 25 to 54. By contrast, Fox News's prime-time commercial breaks are blanketed with pitches for cheap medical devices and insurance companies aimed at retirees and the elderly. Perhaps not surprisingly, the network's advertising rates have grown at a much more modest pace in recent years, according to the Pew survey. Similarly, the growth of its ad revenues has diminished every year since 2008.
Because of the relatively older age and smaller size of the cable news audience, viewership tends to be relatively stable, says Columbia University Journalism School professor and former NBC News president Richard Wald. "Its [ratings] move in very small increments." To understand why viewers come and go, he compares a TV network's audience to a target with concentric rings. The core audiencebthose who are loyal to your channel and watch frequently (and, for partisan media outlets, those who are most ideologically compatible)bis the bull's-eye. Each concentric ring outward represents a segment of the audience that is less likely to watch because of diminished interest or less enthusiastic partisan sympathies. Dramatic ratings shifts can occur, but they tend to be driven by external events, like elections, rather than programming and thus affect all of the networks simultaneously. Most ratings fluctuations are statistical noise, Wald says, resulting from people in the outermost rings tuning in or out based on varying interest. "I would guess that [Fox News's] numbers could change by 5, 6, 7, 8 percent and not reflect a change in the loyalty of the But here, too, the news does not bode well. Though the network did retain its status as the top-rated cable news network in 2012bits eleventh consecutive year at number onebthe steep drop in ratings that its shows have experienced since Election Day has raised eyebrows, precisely because corresponding shows on MSNBC and CNN have not experienced the same precipitous decline.
Just how much of a drop are we talking about? According to Nielsen data, Fox News's prime-time monthly audience fell to its lowest level in twelve years in January among the 25-to-54 demographic. Daytime Fox News programming likewise saw its lowest monthly ratings in this age cohort since June 2008. Even the network's two biggest stars, O'Reilly and Hannity, have not been immune from viewer desertion: Hannity lost close to 50 percent of his pre-election audience in the final weeks of 2012, and  O'Reilly more than a quarter. The slide hasn't stopped in 2013, either. Compared with a year ago, O'Reilly's February prime-time ratings dropped b(26 percent in the coveted 25-to-54 demographic, his worst performance since July 2008. Hannity's sank even further, to the lowest point in his show's history.
As Wald points out, short-term ratings snapshots can be deceptive. But in the weeks following Obama's 2009 inauguration, Fox News's viewership actually surged, averaging 539,000 prime-time demo viewers versus 388,000 and 357,000 for CNN and MSNBC, respectively. This past January, however, Fox could only muster 267,000 average nightly viewersba 50 percent drop from that 2009 level, and not much more than MSNBC's 235,000 or CNN's So why are all these Fox News viewers tuning out? Some of the decline may be due to a broader cultural trend of people deciding to avoid cable TV news altogether. However, a recent Public Policy Polling survey of news media trustworthiness suggests there's more going on than public apathy. In February, PPP found a marked drop in Fox News's credibility. A record-highb(46 percent of Americans say they put no trust in the network, a nine-point increase over 2010. What's more, 39 percent name Fox News as their least-trusted news source, dwarfing all other news channels. (MSNBC came in second, at 14 percent.)
As might be expected, Fox News's credibility barely budged among liberals and moderates (roughly three-quarters of whom still distrust the network) and very conservative viewers (three-quarters of whom still trust it). However, among those who identified themselves as "somewhat conservative," the level of trust fell by an eye-opening 27 percentage points during the previous twelve months (from a net plusb47 percent  "trust" rating in 2012 to plusb20 percent now). Only a bare majority of center-right  conservatives surveyed by PPP say that Fox News is trustworthy.
"The people who are among the moderate-rights are actually the ones tuning out most," says Dan Cassino, a political science professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University who specializes in studying partisan psychology. Last May, Cassino conducted a survey that found Fox News's viewers were less informed about current political issues than those who watched no news at all. In response, the network's public relations team mocked FDU's college ranking in Forbes and belittled its student body as "ill-informed." This kind of ad hominem attack symbolizes the over-the-top, pugilistic messaging style of Ailes, whose no-holds-barred political instincts have dictated the network's direction since day one.
Ailes's foundational idea for Fox News, explains Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple, was to package this bias under the guise of "fair and balanced" news. "It is indeed the artifice of neutrality that makes so much of what they do objectionable, or not just objectionable but noteworthy," Wemple says. And it is effective, he adds: at a recent Value Voters conference, rock-ribbed conservatives almost involuntarily spouted the network's motto back at him when he asked them about Fox's coverage. It's a maddeningly clever bit of misdirectionbthe network whose branding is most identified with objectivity and accuracy is, in fact, anything but.
"Fox viewers are the most misled...especially in areas of political controversy," Chris Mooney writes in The Republican Brain, his 2012 book about the psychology of right-wing myths. The network's singularly corrosive impact on its viewers' understanding of reality, confirmed by numerous studies Mooney highlights in his book, is amplified by this "fair and balanced" motto, he says. It delegitimizes all other news media to create a vicious feedback loop within the right wing.
Thanks to its loyal conservative audience and its cozy relationship with the GOP leadership, Fox News has long been insulated from the consequences of its serial misinforming. "If your job is to say the most outrageous thing you possibly can and be rewarded for it, why shouldn't you?" Cassino points out. "As long as you get ratings, you're going to keep on doing it." But the recent erosion in ratings and cracks in the network's reputation, Cassino says, have created external pressure to make changes inside the network. (Neither Ailes nor anyone else at Fox News would comment when contacted for this story.)
Most notable among these post-election changes involved Fox News ridding itself of contributors Sarah Palin and Dick Morris and replacing them with former Congressman and left-wing gadfly Dennis Kucinich, former GOP Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, and RedState.com editor in chief Erick Erickson. To some, this personnel turnover confirmed that Fox News was embracing a more intellectually honest, ideologically diverse worldview.
But there's less here than meets the eye. First of all, the impact an individual contributor can have on the network's overall nature is minimal; permanent hosts like O'Reilly and Hannity drive its day-to-day brand. And in the midst of the 2012 campaign, Ailes locked up O'Reilly and Hannity as well as news host Bret Baierbthe Fox News lineup from 7 through 10 pmball the way to 2016. What's more, one shouldn't read too much into the cashiering of Palin and Morris, since, by all accounts, they were terrible at their jobs: the former was criticized internally for being uncooperative with programming suggestions and personally disloyal to Ailes, while the latter was guilty of humiliating the network with his ridiculous election predictions (as well as auctioning off an unauthorized personal tour of Fox News' studios at a GOP fund-b(raiser). "They were only interested in  promoting themselves or perhaps promoting an ideology that may not win," says Bartlett, who singles out Palin's lack of substance for his harshest criticism. "Totally and professionally, she's the Lindsay Lohan of cable Indeed, Ailes's new hires are little more than new faces plugged into a well-worn programming strategy. Kucinich fills the slot of house liberal formerly occupied by Alan Colmes, serving as a handy foil for conservatives to shout at or over. The telegenic Brown, a blue-state Republican, endorses textbook anti-woman Republican policies, but does so without giving off an overtly extremist vibe. And die-hard conservative Erickson is there to reassure the Tea Partiers and the netrootsbsome of whom inexplicably believe that Fox News is drifting leftbthat they still have a voice on the Erickson is an interesting case. In February, not long after being hired by Fox, he posted a refreshingly frank essay complaining that the conservative media functions like an "echo chamber" that "peddle[s] daily outrage." Erickson, however, was careful not to include his new employer by name. Of course, selective indignation is something of a running theme for him. After accusing Supreme Court Justice David Souter of bestiality and pederasty in 2009, it took him almost a year to apologizebwaiting until after he took a prominent pundit gig at CNN. "Erick Erickson is obviously a whack job by the standards of a normal person," says Bartlett. "But within the ranks of the right-wing wacko universe, he is far closer to the center than, say, Sarah Palin, because at the bottom, he wants to win, see, where people like Sarah Palin don't give a fuck about winning."
Winning, famously, is what drives Ailes, and Rove as well. In the aftermath of the election, Fox instructed Rove to lie low for several weeks. But this benching didn't last long, and by mid-b(January the network had signed him to a new multi-year contract. Coincidentally, Rove launched a new project geared toward finding more electable candidates for 2014 just a few weeks later. But if the past is prologue, many of these future candidates won't be acceptable to fellow Fox commentator Erickson. "This is perfect grist for the sort of stuff Fox loves to do: 'Let's have a debate between somebody on the right and somebody on the far right,'" Bartlett explains. "That suits their agenda just fine."
In other words, the best interests of Fox News and those of the Republican Party, though inexorably connected, aren't always aligned. The currency of the former is ratings and of the latter, votes. "There's always a tension between the two," says Jonathan Ladd, political science professor at Georgetown University and author of the 2012 book Why Americans Hate the Media and How It Matters. But because the GOP relies so heavily on Fox News to reach its constituents and spread its message, the network exerts its own gravitational pull on the party. "If the Republican Party wants to make an ideological shift, if they want to modify their vision on immigration, say, it matters a lot if Fox commentators and management are willing to go along with that," Ladd points out.
Fox News clearly jumped out in front of the party on the immigration issue. Only two days after Obama's re-election, Hannity, a hardline opponent of undocumented immigrants, came out on his radio program (which is not affiliated with Fox News) in favor of a pathway to citizenship for them. To gun-shy Republicans like Senator Marco Rubio, who had spent 2012 opposing just such a proposal, Hannity was sending an unmistakable signal: they would now have some political cover on the network if they similarly  changed their public views, which Rubio quickly did. In a February article in The New Republic, Ailes, too, made a point of striking a more moderate tone toward Hispanics and said he dislikes the term "illegal immigrant," which the Fox News Latino network no longer uses. These changes of heart, it should be noted, involve only as much courage as it takes to agree with the owner of the company. One day after Obama's re-election and one day before Hannity's epiphany, Rupert Murdoch had tweeted: "Must have sweeping, generous immigration reform, make existing law-abiding Hispanics welcome."
Whether these recent, road-to-Damascus conversions are genuine or artificial may not matter much at this point, though. Hannity and many of his Fox News colleagues have invested so much time inciting animosity toward "illegals" and excoriating legislative attempts at "amnesty" that the network has acquired a reputation of harboring anti-Hispanic tendencies. In the aforementioned PPP poll on media trustworthiness, Hispanics ranked Fox News as their least credible news source, with a net four-point negative rating. (Broadcast news networks all enjoyed double-digit positive ratings.) Likewise, a National Hispanic Media Coalition survey from last fall found that Fox News hosts were more likely than those from any other network to negatively stereotype Latinos. It also noted that the network's audience had the highest percentage of viewers with negative feelings about Hispanics and undocumented immigrants.
Jim Gilmore, the former Republican governor of Virginia and current head of the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative think tank, warned against just this type of demographic alienation in a January interview with National Review. "Shrillness and extreme language are driving away the voters who could help us build a majority," Gilmore said. When contacted for this story, Gilmore made a point of saying that the network is "vital" to the conservative movement and added that his critique was not an  implicit indictment of Fox News: "All I can say is that if they are doing anything like that and polling is reflecting it, they ought to stop it, because that would reflect badly on the Republican Party."
That Gilmore's willingness to confront the party's mistakes hasn't yet caught up to understanding what's causing them is symbolic of the broad dilemma confronting the conservative movement right now. The unquestioning faith in Fox gives the network little incentive to undertake real change, since it allows Ailes to feel confident those prodigal conservative viewers will eventually return to the fold. While Fox still enjoys ratings victories, albeit narrower ones, conservatives have suffered significant losses at the ballot box in three of the past four national elections. And they face the prospect of even more defeats if they don't lead their movement out of the wilderness of serial misinformation and forgo the temptation of perpetual outrage.
Arresting this descent into grand conspiracy theories and self-destructive rancor won't be easy, though. "It makes it very difficult for guests who are being asked about Benghazi and Solyndra to talk about concrete policy issues," Cassino notes. Gilmore, at least, acknowledges as much. "It is our burden to go on Fox News and give the right message," he says. "If for some reasonbratings or whatever the reason isbthe commentators try to drag you to a place where you ought not to be, you have to resist going there."
John Stuart Mill, in his famous treatise On Liberty, understood that a "healthy state of political life" must necessarily include "a party of order or stability, and a party of progress or reform." So where exactly the conservative movement goes from here becomes a critical issue, since the Republican Party isn't about to spiral into electoral irrelevance anytime soon. Therefore, the degree to which it is grounded in reality and willing to collaborate reasonably in governance should matter a great deal to liberals, specifically, and to our democracy in general.
The devil's bargain that Ailes struck between his network and his politics seventeen years ago, however, looks unlikely to change within the foreseeable future. Fox News remains an all-too-comfortable gilded cage for Republicansbone that showcases the party but also shelters it from the slings and arrows of honest intellectual debate. One can rigidly confine an ideology for only so long, however, before its beliefs begin to ossify and its policies atrophy. It's an ironic twist: the more the network enables conservative ideas to stray from the mainstream, the less appealing the network's conservative coverage becomes. And after years of deeming their codependent relationship an unalloyed good, it's time Fox News and the Republican Party face cold reality. For both to enjoy long-term future success, each must recognize that the other isn't its salvation; instead, they're both part of the problem.

This could be as simple as a wifi router that runs independent DHCP/XMPP/BitTorrent/etc., coordinated direct connections for file sharing/serving (SparkleShare, i.e. git over SSH), etc.
Or it could include peer-to-peer client wifi connections.  Or the router devices and/or portable devices could form meshes to get extended range and more of an internet/Internet.
The simple case isn't hard.  I've been thinking of doing the same thing for Burning Man: Resilient, mesh, usually disconnected, store and forward when disconnected, secure + public, fair, prioritized traffic, opportunistic but bulk Internet capable networking in harsh environments and random usage patterns.  Add store and forward to an XMPP server, plus email, some file transfer and usenet like flood propagation (using bittorrent protocols/methods), and you'd have a nice independent communication network.

Compared to various historical precedents, they are effective and aren't terrible overall, but they do not live up to the ideals that are appropriate now.
2) Uplift the sheep.  The elites are failing the sheep, which isn't good for anyone.  We've left it to those who have the responsibility, but many of them are sheep too: shallow functionaries happy enough with the status quo and too scared to fail worse to tinker.
Elites (of a certain range: educated, makers, hackers, thinkers, freethinkers) have the power to change the world.  That includes some who are now considered with the wolves in various senses.  A few smart people changed civil rights, etc.  Don't assume that everyone who is part of the system agrees with it.  People are far more pragmatic than that.  Which generally includes not breaking laws, but can include transparency, dialog, and moving toward improvement.
The greater population have the power to swarm the wolves in various ways, if only they were knowledgeable, motivated, enabled, and led. Some progress has been made, and there are plenty of chinks visible now.  The trick is informing, directing, and/or leading that potential energy through a transformative path that is not more destructive than what you're trying to cure.
Sometimes it means letting groups make fools of themselves long enough for everyone to get tired and aware enough to shun them for long periods after.  The end result of the "moral majority" minority and religious / public power grab and related surge for social freedom/sexual oppression was: free and open porn, negating of nearly all sexual blue laws, momentum for same-sex civil rights, nearly complete change of attitudes, dissipation of religion-in-government and general defeat of religious fundamentalists, an educated liberal probably-atheist black president, etc.  They spent money and time defeating themselves, permanently, and they don't even know why it happened. Sociopolitical judo.  On the other hand, for a long time Rove et al were frequently successful reframing things with clever rebranding of terms: "death taxes" etc.

I assume she was using Outlook and probably Exchange.  Does anyone using Outlook really expect to be able to reliably have access to their old email very long?  I think "those people" are idiots...  I'd guess that Outlook / Exchange versioning issues, curruption, periodic rebuilds / restarts, and general Windows / Microsoft related confusion led periodic lossage that is just the cost of using such technology.
I have a continuous archive of email spanning more than 20 years, and something like 25-30GB, online and always accessible to me. And with numerous backups, all easy to make and restore.  And all using mbox format, around since essentially the beginning of email, which is resilient to corruption, truncation, etc.
In multiple cases, at multiple companies, people have needed access to old email and documents which I had but were long ago lost to everyone else (who mostly used Outlook).  In one case, it allowed a new contract worth probably more than a million or two.
Email is my most reliable source of stored and organized knowledge.  I've been hard at work, in my fragmented spare time, working on a true knowledgebase app / interchange format / distributed security system.  (The key problem really is a much better user interface paradigm.)  You can bet there will be a couple ways to represent and archive it that is as resilient as mbox.

Not really the same at all.  Russia's government is still actively oppressing people in these ways while the US is:
A) Far less homophobic and racist than it used to be.  In some areas, hardly at all.
B) Has gone from the government homophobia hunting people to fire from government jobs in the 1950's to complete legality and usually legal protection now.
C) The Millennials as a group are not homophobic or racist to any measurable degree.  Remaining pockets are becoming more isolated and their youth are changing too, as far as anyone can tell.
The whole culture is rapidly changing in many ways.  Music, Internet, Hollywood, legal cases, politicians (because many have been voted out), etc. have all been changing people's opinions.  The rate of evolution, or at least the rate of maturation of active cycles has been apparently increasing each year.
Pervasive cell phone video, major cases of corruption and overstepping bounds and tragedy have caused major pull back of longstanding troublesome trends.
This is how all of this ties into cypherpunks:  Observing how opinions, public sentiment, then enforcement, regulations, and market options evolve in each of these cycles should be instructive when trying to induce important change.  How can you position things to improve better outcomes when inflection points happen?

The point of a warrant canary is to communicate in a legal way something that is illegal for you to communicate directly.  That involves something like setting laws against each other in some prioritized way or otherwise splitting hairs so that no one can technically be prosecuted.  It is a bit of a legal arms race.
You have to find something you cannot be compelled to do or not do. A dead man's switch of some kind where not doing something is ambiguous and unassailable.  Can you be required by law to go to Starbucks every morning?  To report or not report on Facebook something factual, like you ate Wheaties that morning?  You have a headache?  Something that is protected by a higher priority law, although if the First Amendment is trumped by these laws that's going to be difficult.  Perhaps a group of people probabilistically do or not do something, but any evidence of collusion would be a problem so they would have to act independently.  Some mechanism that relies on someone's thoughts might be sacrosanct.  Visual dwell, polygraph (not that they work at all), etc.
Perhaps every day someone proposes that the warrant canary has triggered, and every day but one someone objects.
Is there or is there not a way to do this legally?  That seems like a gray area, if the First Amendment is trumped, along with other legal protections that could apply.
If there is no way to do this legally, what are the ways to dilute the situation as to be effectively legal, i.e. prosecution would be unlikely or ineffective?
Since the First Amendment is strained here, reasonable people could conclude that the conflicting law is unconstitutional.  That could lead to a sense of responsibility to do the right thing.

If you are inside the US, you do have full protection of US laws, including the First Amendment, although there are some specific exceptions.  Outside the US, it varies.  Ideally, a local law provides similar protection.  US companies will operate as if you do have the same rights, so in some sense and range of situations, the rights extend to everyone globally.

Everything will be run in the cloud and browser because it is, overall, a better computation model. However, that doesn't preclude you from running a cloud locally. Although pretty much proprietary to Google & Amazon until recently, Docker et al and related VM/container management APIs that are mappable to all kinds of implementations will allow apps, administration, networking, etc. to be fluid between commercial and various types of private clouds.
In a lot of ways, this is an elegant solution and could arguably be much more secure than desktop apps in Windows.  Assuming your container system isn't running in Windows, which is becoming an option; one that I won't trust easily.

The browser provides a super feature / security / quality / portable baseline that is rapidly improving.  Only a few alternatives come close and they all fall short in major ways: Qt (which greatly relies on browser tech now), Java & C Unity, UnReal, etc. Certain things are still better in those alternatives, but less and less.  With Javascript optimization, ASM.js, SIMD.js, WebGL, etc., browsers have, for most purposes, resolved the computational gap while having massively better security stance.  WebComponents, the new binary Javascript format, along with WebRTC, WebUSB, and other features, we're getting the cleanest app and platform model we've seen so far.
The key architectural questions about remote communication involve security, efficiency, stability, portability, etc.  While it isn't perfect, web tech provides a nice enough model for expressing the highest level logical communication needed in secure (enough for most purposes), flexible, efficient enough, and low latency enough for most purposes ways.  Solutions like Swagger, Go, and other modern techniques are much cleaner and simpler than previous clunky solutions.
Most of the most interesting web apps now run almost completely in the browser.  The server side sends the original page and code, manages authentication, then acts mostly as a database with minimal logic.  As long as the API doesn't rely solely on client-side validation and other things that could be gamed, it can still be secure.  Because it's now easy to run the same code on the front and back, complex validation could be done on the front-end for low latency and the backend for actual security, for instance.
There are plenty of things that could be better and will get better, but regardless the power & ease gap between web app development, for most situations, is only increasing.  Emulating any substantial subset of browser-level UI and other features in a non-browser desktop app is nearly impossible now.

You don't think ODBC (which was Microsoft's fault, via ANSI) was worse?  CORBA?  Windows itself?  SMB file servers?  We are in massively better shape than we used to be.
Even narrowly true levels of security are better than what we used to have.  Certainly we need to keep getting better.

Sharing all of your secrets, then prosecuting adversaries that make ill use of it, in court and the court of public opinion, is a valid path.  Better, throw in some misinformation so that they are mislead in self-sabotaging ways.
If you are speaking on a line that you know is being recorded by "authorities", what should you be talking about?  In the US at least, perhaps something that would make listeners blush or spend time chasing phantoms or something.  Might as well get your money's worth.  At some point I realized that I should just go to court for every ticket or other opportunity.  If the alternative is that you certainly have to pay, then you might as well learn, get comfortable protecting yourself in court, say your peace, and try whatever legal argument you can think of.  I have about a 50% win rate.
Interesting how certain companies, Apple, feel they need to be totally opaque while others, Google and others, are closer to being mostly open.  Space-X and/or Tesla are giving away free use of some patents, a somewhat related example.

"Stolen code" isn't really an issue most of the time, but can be legally if a lot is used in a way that conflicts with a license. Reusing code snippets is, to a large extent, not really a copyright issue and often fair use or use of something that isn't really protected by copyright.  In any case, it is a legal issue separate from the security implications.
The FUD in question is whether there are security problems of some kind lurking in code, and whether it is easier to compromise a binary when you have source to start with.  The flip side is that it is easier to hide back doors in code that has limited access to source code.  Security mistakes, deliberate malware, and detection are possible in both cases, but in different ways, with different numbers of actual or potential people looking and with different likelihood of active positive or negative collusion.

Valid concerns in the abstract.  In practice, the economic concerns of big cloud providers means they must provide continually upgraded certainty of fundamental security separation.  Part of that is randomness of where your code runs: If there are millions of VMs on hundreds of thousands of physical servers, even if there is a VM escape, it is essentially impractical for malware to target your instance.  This could be enhanced by VM / container hopping in various senses.  Working within the system is likely to provide you a stronger result than something cobbled together locally.
However, we need solutions for that too, with and without cloud technology.  We need people who don't trust the cloud and keep developing better alternatives.  I think some of those alternatives involve cloud technology locally, but that's not a big thing.
I have friends who are rabid Google haters / fearmongers, apparently based on the fact that it was the first company they were aware of that seemed to have access and responsibility for too much information, or too much of their information, or too strong an allure for their information.  I feel perfectly confident that Google is going to protect their billions in income and valuation by being very careful with avoiding abusing their data or users in any strong sense.  That might not withstand a court order or national security letter or TLA hack monitoring unencrypted links, although big Silicon Valley companies recently have been getting tougher there.  But it certainly means they aren't "reading my email" for prurient or invasive purposes that would be embarrassing to me: It would become embarrassing to them quickly and cost millions or billions.

Perfectly within the realm of the possible.  A lone employee may be able to abuse things, but they likely will be caught, fired, and the incident has some chance of being righted and paid off.  Unlikely to actually be the case in any pervasive way.  Nearly all conspiracies leak eventually.  Being a commercial company, they are a huge target for a jackpot payday.  TLAs have no such worry, which is why when they do illegal things and otherwise drift or charge outside the boundaries that it is so bad.  A few years ago, before Congress stepped in to let them off the hook, phone companies like ATT were in a tight spot for allowing a lot of open access to customer data. I'm sure that legal departments everywhere took notice of that exposure; Congress isn't going to do that too many more times, and especially not for commercial gain.
Parallel construction is a big problem, although I think that it has been exposed in some major cases lately that should soften courts for detecting and confronting it.  It's possible both for prosecutors, TLAs, and companies wanting to steal proprietary trade secrets.  Perhaps practical and legal techniques used to combat insider trading may start to provide some protection.  It is at least possible to take countermeasures to expose parallel construction: information that provides ways of detecting eavesdropping is an obvious solution.
It is certainly the case that we should consider the possible, especially since there have been a number of surprises about how far things actually did go in the past, especially the TLAs, but also sometimes with companies with really bad culture.  But that red team gaming shouldn't spill over too much into our rational assessment of actual risks and reasonable countermeasures.  There is a typical problem I call the Fallacy of Insisting on Zero Risk: A mother fearing their children using the bathroom at the mall alone or calling the police because someone else's child walks to the park alone while thinking nothing of horse riding or football or rodeo or smoking.  Or OSHA related spending millions per death to prevent one type of injury while ignoring other much lower hanging injury risks.  Gun control, vaccines, playground equipment, etc. often involve similar elements.  When making actual concrete security choices, a rational actor considers the threat, opportunity, costs, rewards, exposure, overhead, etc. when weighing what measures are worth taking.
In a presentation to the Nevada Gaming Commission years ago, I used the analogy of protecting nuclear weapons: The cost of a compromise is nearly infinite, so the amount you would be willing to rationally invest to prevent a compromise also can be nearly infinite.  (But apparently not given recent events related to those crews.) Everything else falls in a lower tier where there is a cost / benefit tradeoff.  You can go far enough in taking measures that you are worse off than if you had been compromised in the worst probable way.  The question there was how much certainty was needed that an Internet gambler was of age.  We went through a similar thing related to porn: Early on, many jurisdictions insisted on absolute certainty that a remote viewer was of age, or a company-ending lawsuit or criminal case would result.  Now, porn is essentially wide open, with at most proof of control of a credit card required to verify age; easily bypassed by a determined teenager, who could legally have a Visa debit card anyway.  For one thing, most of the supposed damage (Meese report etc.) was bogus, so few controls are really called for.
Now, many of us here want to be able to protect ourselves and others out of principle, need, career, and/or interest.  We may find it fun and career worthy to have TLA / scammer / evil genius defeating countermeasures and tradecraft.  We may get to the point we actually need it, or work with clients who definitely do.  But we shouldn't slip into unnecessary paranoia, especially if it gets to the point of shooting ourselves in the foot.  When we're making an argument, we are often taking the paranoid view because that's required to get into the right mindset.  After determining how to prevent issues, we should then decide what is actually worth putting into place.
I've run my own physical Internet server, including my own DNS servers, since 1992 when I obtained my first domain name and started a couple ISPs.  For various reasons, I will continue to do that, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to others, especially the non-technical.  My uptime, currently at 267 days, is basically the lifetime of the hard drive or the rare case when the colo moves things around.

Traditional corporate onsite compute, storage, network, security, software (Oracle etc.) is almost always extremely expensive.  While a raw hard drive may be inexpensive, if you buy it in an EMC or mainframe storage array, you are going to pay many multiples more per GB, compute minute, etc.  And, if you bought anything more than you actually use, you're being very wasteful.  Parts of the cloud revolution are rapid just in time purchase, deployment, change, new scalable methods, etc., but economically, it is often tremendously less expensive than a commercial solution plus the support staff to make it work.  In the most efficient traditional local deployment possible, this may not be true initially, but for the vast majority of mediocre corporate IT departments, it is very true.
If you are large and/or savvy enough, the thing to do is to borrow cloud system methods and run a cloud for yourself.  Currently, that's not completely easy or turnkey.  At some point, we should get to a clean utility computing model, but it will take a few more generations of evolution.

It's 10x for the drive, another 10x for the box to put it in, another 10x for a license for the software to get to it, ... (Roughly. ;-) )  You can be nickle and dimed up front or over time. In the latter case, it will continue to get more competitive and begin to have local systems with the same characteristics.
How much does an additional 4TB of storage for a z13 cost?
Most cloud systems fall into the embarrassingly parallel category. Many smaller, cheaper, cooler units completely outclass, in price and scalability, bigger, faster, higher bandwidth solutions, unless those are built inexpensively with smaller, cheaper, cooler units. We're finding out whether medium sized (Intel/AMD desktop / server class CPUs) or small (ARM mobile chipsets) are going to scale better, but either way, a many node system has an aggregate memory bandwidth that dwarfs old-style mega CPU systems.  It's not clear, but it appears that the z13 is just an integrated cloud-style clustered system with a bunch of nice added features[2].  If so, which is the only way it could compete on scale and cost, it is a branded cloud system.  Would it really be less expensive to operate than an Open Compute local cloud?  Probably only if you made a lot of assumptions about overhead, etc.
The z13 looks cool, and has a lot of interesting features.  It will be interesting to see how it does.
If you have the type of business where you know what you need and how much of it you need, you can competitively provision a local solution, although there are still plenty of ways to go wrong.  And many do, IMHO.  Many businesses have relatively modest needs, don't know what their growth will look like, etc.  Large up front costs are bad in a lot of situations, as is committing to a certain scale when there is a lot of uncertainty.
The number of businesses and organizations who fit that narrow situation are few and dwindling.  Sales will be able to rope in plenty more for a while, but for many it is not a sane choice. Security breaks are mostly about passwords, trojans, spear phishing, zombie machines, etc.  For every possible exploit of a cloud system, which at the infrastructure level should have well-funded security, I feel there are many more gaps in the typical local alternative: Sloppy, old Windows systems with a sloppy network, open to everyone file servers, poor access control, terrible custom programming, no significant physical security, etc.  The best systems + networks + policies + personnel are more secure, everyone else is just lucky not to be targeted.
This covers some of this territory:

I hold multitudes.  I am in one thread totally cypherpunk, and have been for a very long time.  There are innumerable ways to compromise and be compromised for all kinds of good and mostly bad reasons.  Perfect protection is tough for in many ways and we should keep striving to get closer to that ideal security stance.
On the other hand, life is a balance.  I probably shouldn't have tried to make the point here, but it is something a security professional should understand well: The right amount of security should be moderated by the tradeoff of costs vs. overhead vs. maximizing benefit vs. minimizing loss.  Security stances change over time and aren't necessarily accurately reflected by paranoid An example along these lines that I like to keep in mind:
(I really did avoid writing down passwords anywhere for a long time.  And I still don't carry them with me.  If I did, they wouldn't be plaintext.)
It is terrible that some companies have been too eager to share information.  They may or may not have believed whatever safeguards were in place, or not cared, etc.  I'm sure a high pressure meeting with an FBI crew who are strongly playing the terrorism angle is persuasive, as it should be, up to a point. And companies holding your data can actually look at that data for business purposes, although how they use it is somewhat bounded by privacy laws (however incomplete), not making private things public, unfair business practices, etc.  My point was that the existence of large, valuable services that depend on a lot of trust is, or should be to a sane entity, an even stronger incentive to behave than the patchwork of laws.  Past oversharing, then embarrassment and public abuse, coupled with product impacts as they lose sensitive customers, has almost certainly caused a cleanup of those attitudes.  I'd be interested in the actual policy right now, although I doubt they are going to be too explicit.  I suspect that it also varies heavily by corporate culture.
Every day, you are somewhat at the mercy of dozens and perhaps thousands of people who could cause you pain, suffering, or death if they were so inclined.  There are many in the government, schools, employer personnel departments, medical and insurance companies, etc.  The people driving around you, stopped at a light while you cross the street, making your food, they all have access and the ability to inflict misery on you.  You have to trust someone to some extent.  The question is who you trust, how incentivized they and the people / organization around them protects you, whether wrongs will be limited, corrected, and righted or not.
For a long time, as a contractor at the peak of their heyday, I had access to AOL's entire user database, complete with name, address, full credit card info, phone numbers, etc.  I could have also snooped on their Buddylists, their person-to-person video (Instant Images), and a lot more.  There was zero chance that I would abuse any of that.

You're making an unqualified assumption about my unqualified qualifier "up to a point"...
Feel free.  I totally mock and rail about it too.  I can see several sides to this, and I've been on enough "sides" of these problems, at least in some weak sense, to have some model of decision making by people in those roles.  Poor decisions are understandable until there are enough cases, noticed and confronted, to make the right path clear.  We're getting a lot of those lately.  EFF, SPLC, ACLU, and others, sometimes including commercial entities, are providing an invaluable service of evolving both the law and internal commercial and government policy.
Hacking the system cleverly and deliberately is one of the cooler forms of hacking.
A few quibbles: for-profit is sociopathic-by-default perhaps, although even there you are assuming some socioeconomic system. You're also glossing over whether and when consent is an issue. People in public places sometimes believe that others need consent to take their picture; generally not true.  Is it rude to take your picture and does rudeness matter?  That depends.  "Beyond your expectations" is also problematic: How could any possible expectation ever be said to be adhered to?  Perhaps "generally accepted fair use as defined by EFF" or something (if there is such a thing) might be reasonable.  What is the definition of "many people"?
If you use language that can never be satisfied in any reliable way, you can't really complain that an entity isn't satisfying it.
Education is always good.  Don't infect others with pathological paranoia, but a healthy understanding of risks and exposures is always good.
Not inherently.  Social, economic, legal, contractual, and other cultural systems allow, disallow, guide, and control people in their interactions.  The US, for instance, has always been a place where there were many unwritten rules of operating in business.  Some have run roughshod over those, sometimes reaping unjust rewards and/or changing what is acceptable, but there are always things that could be done that just aren't.  Further, a particular entity could impose upon itself, by charter, culture, or customer agreement, a more stringent stance than others.  There could be mechanisms that audit or otherwise control this.
You get what you optimize for.  If you have a default corporation controlled by weak, shallow leaders and driven by shallow, blind Wall Street numbers, then the result is likely to be sociopathic. On the other hand, however imperfectly or incompletely, certain companies have a founder-driven culture of a far more empathic nature than this default, whether they be different or have a stated desire to not be evil.  Both of those companies largely care about users in some strong sense, much unlike certain other highly and chronically annoying entities.
One person's use is another person's abuse.  People should be aware.
Abuse is wrong, use may not be.  Sometimes depends on where you stand.  Some types don't have agreement.  Plenty of people hate the idea of automated ad filtering based on the content of email or chat or other activity.  There are things that could go wrong with that if it gets to a human or is gamed, but properly done anonymously, it can be fine: I'd rather get timely ads I may care about than the much larger set of uninteresting dreck.  I actually suggested doing exactly this with AOL chatrooms in about 1996. This is a good example of good education vs. bad education: If you say "This could be misused or leaked in a way that could be a problem if a company isn't careful, and here is a scenario..., and here is how that could be handled better..." that's fine, especially if a company can indicate the level of care & security they're currently employing.  If you say: "Google is reading your email, sending it to every company that wants to buy it for a few cents!" that's disingenuous at best and dangerous to certain people's mental state at worst.
I was mainly talking about making realistic decisions without a value statement for current practices, which we are all going to have different opinions on since they aren't public.
We should have some taxonomy of the nature of those abuses, with consensus lines drawn as to what we all find acceptable or not acceptable, why, and what mechanisms best resolve the issue.
Some are not at certain points, or all are not at some points, or only mine is as far as I know.  Take your pick.
Have you noticed the difference in nature of various companies over time?
Of course; it may not be worth anything, but I do actual work.  You don't?  You're not doing your taxes properly if not...  ;-)
Who CAN be trusted?  At some level, no one, but we've already established that in the real world, you generally have to trust people all the time.
Are you sure you are applying your distrust criteria in a comprehensive and rational way?
They pretty much still do.  And it is silly to say they can't.  They are a relatively giant company.  Mistakes happen.  What mistakes are they making now?
    You can make money without doing evil.
All companies that I know about are filled with people.  They may be sheeple a little too often (I have permanently fired ATT Mobile (formerly Cingular) for refusing to issue a refund to my son when they screwed up "because the policy prevents us".), but it is personal at some level.  You are trusting that the Comcast installer is not a murderer, that the banker isn't stealing from you, and that the well-paid Google engineer has better things to do than to eavesdrop on you.
Whether all are, or even a predominant amount are, is questionable. Many people care about customers, their career, mission, etc.  Money is only an issue occasionally.
There are some who have acted that way, for sure.  I have my black list.  Others try.  They deserve a little credit, and help when

Are you saying that the Pentagon is never good or useful?  Nor are any of their spying efforts?
They don't?
You have never benefited in any way from the US marines?  The footprint there is pretty large.  You think they are somehow fundamentally evil when they don't determine their goals or rules of engagement?  Their job is to be a bad ass tool, the proverbial big stick.  It is someone else's job to decide how to use that tool. Marines don't kill people, politicians using Marines kill people. Err, something like that.
There are high ranking scumbags from the CIA here?  Interesting.
Is everyone from the CIA scumbags by definition?
FLOSS has bloatware?  Are you using the same meaning as the rest of us?  What's your favorite alternative?
Someone explaining bits of the world are not necessarily an apologist for those bits.  Trying to correct or moderate viewpoint extremism (see what I did there?) with more balance, or logic, or other viewpoints isn't necessarily being an apologist either; that's the kind of accusation that usually comes from someone slinging not fully supported barbs.  I do think Google is better than some other companies, but that's pretty weak on the apologist scale; I was more making a statement about a class of companies and how they should rationally act with respect to security.
What's your alternative to all of these things?  If you really are into security in any sense, you should be able to explain what security exposures moderating or eliminating those entities would cause and what you would advocate to replace them.
I'm offended in various ways by a lot of what happened in the past, often in organizations like DOJ, FBI, etc. that should have known better.  I would even say that a lot of government employees and contractors seem to have got away with a lot of things they shouldn't have.  But that doesn't mean that any of those organizations are fundamentally evil and aren't almost completely staffed by intelligent, respectable people.
Anyway, if you're still in the rebelling against authority stage, fine, have fun.  Good luck with that.  In the US, government wise, the people are the authority, their own authority in essence, it just may take a long time for that to play out in a given area.  In some ways, this is also true for companies, with some nuance.

The Pentagon et al are protecting a large portion of the world from being overrun.  Nobody else will do it.
Are police always bad too?
Whatever you gotta believe.  Most of their job is to understand the world, publishing both a nice public database and the presidential daily brief (today's news).  And to consult with the President as need so that hopefully reasonably intelligent decisions are made, but that depends on the intelligence of the current president.
And FBI, CIA, State, Google, etc.
DOJ, Treasury, State, HHS, etc. are filled with worthless murdering scumbags?
There are certain people, Marines et al, who are trained to be very lethal.  Sucks to need that, but being anything less than the strongest & baddest isn't an option for the US.  They are concentrated, supposed to be carefully deployed and directed. Create people like that from the subset of people who want to be like that and a few are going to go off the rails occasionally. That's a bummer, and needs to be constantly protected against, but there's no obvious alternative.
The US is the least imperialist top superpower that ever existed. Still not perfect, but better than all the rest.
Oh kay.  Are  you off your meds?
You haven't been watching long or closely enough.  Things have changed a lot in the US in my lifetime, and it's only speeding up.
Nonsense again.

Just for fun, I reread this.  Based just on the text of this page, there is little that is really a gotcha of any significance.  A bunch of well-placed, powerful people know each other, bla bla. Google Ideas is trying to spread access to the Internet far and wide and, like any US citizen or company should, consults with the State department when doing anything with a non-first-world-country.  The CIA might also want Internet access far and wide in those countries, perhaps for fairly great reasons: general education, anti-propaganda, etc.  A modern, educated, liberal technologist wants to counteract extremism with education in any way feasible, oh my.  The government is paying for services they are using?  Is that unusual?
Where is there something that is actually illegal, regressive, or otherwise actually a problem?  Plenty of innuendo and situations that could potentially be bad, but where's the meat?
I like Wikileaks at all overall.  Very entertaining, and some people should stay organized while heavily scrutinizing those in power to detect and expose abuse, or even the appearance of abuse.  But I'm not confused by this kind of innuendo and imprecise characterizations.  Be specific and clear about what exactly was wrong.  What was the specific harm?  What should people have done

Polymer 1.0 web app, which is the cleanest HTML / Javascript yet, talking via Swagger IO library to a Go single-executable Docker container (break out of that!) with a very simple matching webAPI app structure...  That was some work to find, validate, and select; you're welcome.
I love how Microsoft is happy that their mini Windows VM is "only" 400MB to start.
Web browsers are the new operating system, so I cut Firefox some slack.  Most of what you interact with in the browser API is a Javascript web app anyway.  I often have up to 700 tabs open...  It is the Javascript on those tabs that makes it a pig.

There are multiple avenues possible of assurance, architecture, audit, obfuscation, canaries, etc.  Perhaps encrypted computing will be useful; already encrypted storage is relatively easy to use for at least some circumstances (object stores, backup).  If billions of lightweight container-based compute transactions are flowing through a system that pools payment and has secure distributed storage and communication, is it possible to be too obscure to identify and tap?
Spammer scammers are practicing this kind of thing daily, and countermeasures are being created too, but as for most of that there is a final traceable step, email etc., that's not quite the same as some other private security goals.

This is farcical, but one more round lest silence be taken as tacit agreement.  For those of you who can't efficiently process unwanted email, apologies.  And consider getting a better email client + plugins.
Not really, more from warlords, dictators, etc.  Supposedly Russia is "only protecting their ethnic Russians".  From what?  Joining NATO and Western Europe as far as I could tell.
Yep, the US has been involved in all kinds of past situations, along with a number of other countries.  Those were indeed the bad old days.  Sometimes intentions were good, sometimes maybe not.  It's too bad that people 40-80 years ago didn't have 2015 sensibilities. Romans begat Europe, British begat a lot, including terrible treatment of Aborigines and Maori.  Europe decimated American Indians.  Slavery.  But you imply that past possibly-poor actions indicate present value.  Hardly.  None of those people are in power and most are dead.  Everyone has learned a lot, J. Edgar Hoover is no longer blackmailing US Presidents and everyone else to preserve his FBI empire, etc.  Americans beat up on America quite a bit and all of this eventually comes out, often these days as very watchable movies that authoritatively teach what we weren't taught in school, about the US and often the rest of the world.  Generally, lessons are learned and we do better in the future.  But occasionally someone slips in who is not an intellectual powerhouse and mistakes are made again.  Se la vie.  What's your better alternative?
Even when the US meddled, except for a very few circumstances, it was to achieve something useful, not to subjugate peoples for colonies, incorporation into an empire, etc.  The US pays a lot for legacy military bases everywhere, provides lots of protection and other benefits, and generally attempts fit in and be respectful.
What is your concept?  That no one have power to repel anyone else? That some other country / culture is better suited to being "on top"?  The US is the worst system, except for everything else.  It is deliberately designed to be messy, in conflict, and unstable. The genius of this arrangement is that it leads to a stronger result than anything else.
Many non-Americans don't really get America, even if they have visited or lived here.  Many Americans don't fully get America either; easy to be parochial.
Not long ago, someone was tearing into the US about teargas being used in some situation, how terrible and dangerous it was, etc.  I pointed out, with references, that every single American military individual is subjected to a good dose of teargas as part of training.
In some cases, regime change can be nice.  Depends on specifics.
Yea?  Interesting.  I think you've been watching Fox News too much. Or you are talking about New Jersey.  ;-)
We obsess about that stuff precisely because it isn't tolerated at all, except for narrowly acceptable, mostly noise levels.
How do you come to think this?  What's your evidence?
Yea?  What would constitute a fall for the US?  I don't think you understand the nature of the US or what would constitute a win.
Few would agree with that.
Depends on what you look at.  There are some things that we as a group definitely think were mistakes, Iraq etc.
What do you think the "success" of a USA grab for global hegemony would look like?  What do you think the USA end goal is if it wasn't "stopped"?
Your construction there seems off, but:
Much of aggression has been about answering threats, directly or indirectly.  So your statement doesn't apply to Afghanistan, WWII, etc.  Korea, Vietnam, etc. were about a perceived threat that seemed real; we generally consider those to probably have been wrong on multiple levels.  I guess you think that if anyone supports the US, they must be agreeing with everything that's ever happened. Obviously that's a terribly simplistic assumption.
"Capture the sanction of foreign thinkers"? Nonsense.

You do realize that it was the British that depopulated the islands, right?  The land had been purchased, there were about 1200 people displaced, and it happened 40 years ago.
In any case, that falls into the category of something that shouldn't have been done, at least not in so poor a way.

I will have to dig to find my archives of that era to be positive, but I'm pretty sure I joined by 1994 at the latest, probably 1993. I installed the first firewall at Bank of America in late 1994, so it may have been much earlier since I'd already been into security for a while at that point.  I was part of the whole rise and fall of Detweiller.  I'm always puzzled that most people haven't heard of him.

As far as I know (and I've not paid diligently close attention to further developments after the aftermath died down, so please update my statements), the consensus is that that last update and the tongue-in-cheek directive to use Bitlocker was likely a warrant canary, i.e. they could no longer be independent and uncompromised so they burned the project, staying legal while upholding principles.
However, shortly thereafter others have taken the previous public open source version, forked it, in some cases begun (and maybe finished) an audit of the code.  The results of those should be usable as secure with some degree of confidence.  YMMV.

I've run my own box on the Internet continuously since 1992.  But there is a payment history, it's been in the same location for 8 years, etc.  When I imagine a more secure (in certain senses) alternative, as least as an individual, it usually involves public cloud services, perhaps in some ephemeral rotating basis way.  First you need to secure DNS, or some similar alternative, then...  Tor or similar helps for a certain class of usage, but then you're outside the normal Internet world.  Without interesting goals, no point in interesting solutions other than knowing how to do interesting solutions and what their limitations are.  Which is a good thing in and of itself.

Not sure why a sexist slur makes any difference.  Murderous?  Are all US leaders, in general, murderous because the US (and others)
feels it has to act as world policeman in generally impossible to finesse circumstances?  Are policemen "murderous" because some of
them are?  What is your measure for 'murderous' here?  At what point is self-defense not murderous?  Do you think it is unfair for
the US to have an asymmetric advantage?  What does the presence of several orders of magnitude of better technological
sophistication say about any particular pairing of cultures?
The US never wants to fight.  The goal is always to buy and sell things, share ideas, and party.  Ignorant idiots who imagine that
they will pick a fight and somehow 'win' without first building a more effective culture are sadly clueless.
Feel free to point out the propaganda.  There certainly have been untrue or weak statements made by certain politicians and
officials, and usually are followed up quickly by public dissection and correction by the US and other media and others.  Perhaps in
the very short term, this is sometimes propaganda, but usually it seems more like mistakes / wrong guesses / inferences,
self-delusion, and, once in a while, ruses.  Even secret things often eventually get out; by US law, most secret things have to be
disclosed after some period of time.
But feel free to highlight, specifically, all of the propaganda that you are assailed with.
If you say so.  Seems like a character study to me, sad all around.
Examples?  References?
Research much?
We call it 'free press' and 'investigative journalism'.  Sure, there is a little bias in what they decide to investigate.  But any
untruths would be quickly countered by another news organization somewhere in the Western world.  Or RT, which doesn't seem half bad
except for certain Russian-interest reporting.
Basic humanist principles.  If you think that allowing people to suffer and die in ignorance, from disease, starvation, and stone
age practices, is the only way to avoid fascism, then your argument is pretty weak.  What is fascist about educating people about
science, sociology, psychology, etc.?
See above.  You have to be very uninformed and impressionable to believe it was a false flag attack.
The US and the Western world have been dominating the world in the cultural / technological / defense senses for a long, long time. Usually, they studiously try to avoid direct domination now by enlightened choice. To a large extent, the US doesn't want or need to
dominate the world except for security purposes.  Everyone sane wants people everywhere to have better lives in every sense.  A few
of those people think that expanding religion is the answer; I'm completely opposed to that in all forms.  Most think that better
secular knowledge and training would produce a much better life, regardless of starting point.  Unfortunately, minimizing knowledge
is a key component is a key part of the survival meme set of many religions.  The truly educated tend to graduate from religion.
If you were to choose 1000, and maybe even only 100 competent individuals with a good range of knowledge and skill from the US or a
number of Western countries, and placed them in a village anywhere in the world, absent fundamentalist warfare, they would start a
growing evolution / revolution within a generation.  The differences between societies aren't geographic, genetic, or magic: poorly
educated people with broken culture will fail anywhere while the opposite is generally true.  Nationalist fighting as if it were
equivalent sports teams or family feud squabbles with no right or wrong just obscures the real issues.  That tends to hurt everyone
not in the US and EU; on average, it hardly affects our lives.
For me, Russia is a Western country in this sense.  Metropolitan China, Japan, and India are too.  So, First World really, but most
of those are converging on Western values where it counts.
Yes, it seems you have been wasting your time.

Perhaps you were using the UK definition of 'cunt', although that usage is, I think, often as an endearment, much like 'bastard' or
'dude' in the US.  In some locales, it's almost always used in a sexist sense.  Anyway, your stooping to ad hominem attacks means
you've already lost the argument.
I was on BBSs in 1982, Compuserve in 1984, UUCP/Usenet in 1987 (a couple hops from uvax), running a server on the Internet
continuously since 1992, setting up a couple ISPs including a satellite link in the early 90's, on AOL in 1995 (I wrote BuddyList
for AOL.), and various other things.  Calling me names on the Internet is not going to phase me.
Well, no wonder.  So, if you were President of the US, what would you do differently?  How would that work better?
Define 'anarchist' and 'crypto-anarchist', think a little, and you may find some answers.
Let's go with the Wikipedia definition:

References: And empowered by freedom and free speech invented and protected by The West, and the US in particular.  It seems likely that the
degree of free speech in other Western countries came about, was extended, and/or was protected because of the US First Amendment. There was some existing precedent, and some countries have had various restrictions, but the impenetrable First Amendment provided
the most firm model.  Every aspect of interpretation had to be fought about, especially including encryption and encryption
technology, sometimes with kind of funny results.  The fact that electronic source code was restricted while the same code printed
in a book couldn't be restricted at all kind of broke some arguments.
Everything about the Internet could have been worse, and would have been had it evolved any other way.  It's not just because it
started in the US, but because of the people involved, the peculiar restrictions of DARPA funding, think tank goals, and the
telecommunications monopoly that ATT had at the time, along with their inability to believe that packet switching had any value over
circuit switching.  We are very lucky, and we owe a lot to a small set of people who made many great choices.
By contrast:
The US, and much of the West, fought all this out 20 years ago.
Let's expand this idea, which I posted on the 6th:
Cypherpunks could only have survived and thrived and made a difference by being predominantly based in the US.  On the other hand,
it was helped along and strengthened by international participation, which probably tipped the balance in a number of cases.  The
balance of powers, freedom vs. Federal / police control, public vs. private, etc. all tend to come down on the side of the state and
against the individual or group if a country doesn't have airtight constitutional protections.  For instance, while France is
generally a nicely free country, it had been illegal to use encryption in a lot of cases in France until fairly recently:
Encryption and privacy is like tax law: You should understand what your rights are, where the lines are, and you're within your
rights to go right up to the line.  And, when something isn't right, you should be able to explain why precisely and work to fix
it.  We keep knocking down laws that, if they survived, would become templates for other countries.  A few things that slipped
through have proved that.
Which isn't to say that the US is perfect.  In many ways, the US is always imperfect, always in a squabble or fight about rights and
limits, land grabs or monopoly and healthy commerce; that's part of the design of the system and what enables it to generally work
and improve long term.  Things tend to go in the right direction eventually, catching up with or adopting best practices from
elsewhere.  It is a model of stable instability, noise that causes eventual escape from disoptimal minima / maxima.  A lot of other
systems are similar, but seeing some of them go bad, I wonder how many are missing the complete model of balance of powers needed
for more permanent stability and resiliency.  The quality of people involved can keep any system working somewhat for a while, or
conversely they can break a fairly good system.  The interesting measure, and the real measure of comparison, is whether a system is
elastic and resilient enough to handle extreme torque, failing in little ways gracefully while never failing overall, and still keep
One apparent exception, by many people's standards, is guns where historical decisions have a long throw.  As yet another resiliency
strategy, a kind of defense in depth at the state level, it may or may not still have some of the same effect.  We'll just have to
solve the problem of effective prevention of mental illness (and very bad meme sets) while suffering some attrition on that front. Solving those is hard, but extremely important and valuable.  Determined people don't need guns to kill other people, so I'm
skeptical that gun control helps much.  We're entering the age of building anything on demand starting only with information and/or
imagination, so the impulse of controlling the existence of things is going to rapidly become less effective.  Seems like we're
almost ready to seriously work on maintaining the quality of mental health and emotional health and culture.
This book, perused last night, seems to be on the right track, exploring that direction:

The world has a long memory; true propaganda, distorting or outright lying about the actual facts, is going to be quite apparent
later.  It's fine for Russia to be proud of themselves, but it seems like they have been embarrassing themselves frequently.  In the
unlikely event that we elect Trump, we might return the favor for a while.  But everyone would see through it and know it would stop
in 4 years, so it would likely be more humorous than anything.  The US is too open and too self-examining in public for much false
propaganda to get very far for long.
I'm not sure that American Sniper is propaganda, even unintentionally.  Seems mostly like highlighting the sad situations people
have allowed to happen.  Perhaps in the Strongest Tribe sense it has some weight, but snipers are a narrow, special breed.  I would
think that the magical hand of God like drone war would have more weight.  The effect depends on what those people are thinking: Do
they realize that they can never win in any serious sense?  Do they care or are they fine with just proving a point?
The US almost completely holds back on propaganda / education in the world, maybe for fear of or a general policy against being seen
to be promulgating propaganda.  In most cases, where media and news and the Internet flow openly, it isn't really needed.  However,
when hardly anyone in Afghanistan knows anything at all about 9/11 or similar, that is a failure of the world to provide even basic
knowledge to everyone.  Separate from that, just understanding how a modern culture works, whether the US or Europe or any other
high-functioning society, would be an important thing for some seriously problematic masses of people to know.  I don't care who
causes effective education to bring these people up to date with understanding modern cultures, but it needs to happen.  In the
absence of some other paths, it would seem like an important strategy for both US State and Defense, but I don't see it happening much.
The US has no need to try to make people like it; that should not generally be a goal.  But the world, especially including the
capable Western world, both governments and populations, has a responsibility to educate those with abject ignorance, poverty, and
knowing nothing but conflict that there are better ways of being, limitless opportunities, and that they could effectively work to
modernize and become effective societies and cultures.  We need something similar to 'genocide' to identify pathological ignorance,
recognize that it leads to the ruin of many lives, and determine how to take action to stop it.  There is no need for each culture
to be exactly like the West or a particular form of government, but they should understand the options, understand how things can
work effectively and why, and be able to incorporate elements in a local way to eventually make it work.  We need to decide how
hands off we should be in allowing large areas to fumble about without making progress and even regress.  The prime directive should
only apply to societies that are functioning to a reasonable degree.
An interesting question is whether and how poisoned thinking, i.e. bad memes, are shared, instilled, and propagated to eventually
create terrorists and criminals:  What should we do to prevent spreading poisonous ideas?  Should we be rooting out bad imams,
literature, religious leaders?  Ideally, our values and culture is an effective answer to these sources, but, just like in the
biological world, eventually a successful defense will occur.  If you've read The Selfish Gene, you know that truth, rightness, or
goodness are not the goals of particular genes or memes (ideas).  The only thing that determines success is successful competition
and replication.  Our Western ideas can successfully compete and replicate against these bad meme sets, but only if they are
present.  We seem to be in a situation where some of our allies are supporting the teaching of memes that are directly opposed to
modern knowledge, including social and political knowledge.  What should we do about that?
All of this is crosscutting to security, encryption, communication, publishing, and surveillance.  Distrust is healthy, and
sometimes prudent.  And, if we fail totally as a modern society, we may need it to maintain a modern underground in our new dark
ages.  In addition to safe commerce and social connection, and balancing government and keeping it healthy, we should even better
organize and extend the ways that we help enlighten the ignorant while combating meme cancer.
I imagine that soon we'll have universally available Internet (LEOs for instance), ultra-inexpensive devices (smart phones are down
to $50 or less now), and organized, complete, and effective educational material that is somehow available, safe, and effective for
everyone.  There should be some kind of support systems of various kinds, to the extent possible.  We are failing for not working
toward these kind of things effectively enough.
