Does one exist for the MAC? If not, would anyone be interested enough to see
one developed?

  OFFICE MEMO         RSAREF for Mac?                       Date:  5/14/96
It seems that I have seen this question asked before, but as I had no need for
the answer at that time, I trashed it. So, without further ado:
Can anyone point in the direction of RSAREF for the Macintosh? expectantly, (no, i'm not pregnant,)

Reply to:   RE>(Another) alternative to remailer shutdowns
Where would these message parts be put back together/decrypted? Wouldn't this
require the receivers mail program to re-generate the original message?
Instead of having the last remailer in the chain store the plaintext of
an encrypted anonymous message, it might be more convenient to have the sender split the message into two messages and send these. The first message would contain random characters,  and the second would contain the xor of these random characters with the anonymous message. By themselves, each piece would, of course, be harmless random text, so remailer operators
greatest crime would be spamming. If the two pieces were sent through chains with different last remailers, no one operator could be held
accountable, and, of course, it would be ridiculous to suggest that
one operator could be held responsible for that fact that another
sent some random text which happened to be the xor of the random text
another had sent with a harassing message. (For instance, the
other operator could be trying to frame the first, with the
help of the receiver.) It seems to me that the only way to deal with a remailing scheme of this kind would be outlaw anonymous remalining in

Thirded, with bilateral agreement.
such, seconded. If it would remove from cypherpunks discussion of
implementation or of social consequences, that wouldn't be good, since the
implementation of this is definitely cypherpunks material.
