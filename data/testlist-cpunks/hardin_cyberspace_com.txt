I just looked @ the front of a M.O. computer catalog & the numerals in the
prices are anything but random. A very heavy concentration of eights (8) &
nines (9), apparently this company is more into $508.98 (color inkjet printer)
& $38.98 (well known game s/w) than the old late night TV standby of
"JUST $19.99!". Of course, this is because of excessively documented
ad nauseum human psychological tendencies that salescritters, who set at
least the lsd's of price, have been aware of for millenia. I'd bet, that
5(five), 8(eight), & 9(nine) are significantly more represented across
the board in prices (& thus in amounts for checks & tax write offs) than
than their random distribution by Benford's Law or more well known tests
for randomness would suggest. Has Mr. Negrini factored this into his program?
I guess the lesson is do a few pgp make__random's & convert a few of the
hex numbers to dec digits for the lsd's the next time one does creative expense

Yes, and some vendors will be in state (sales tax) & some out of state (no
sales tax). Furthermore, if the vendor is in state but in a different locale,
there will probably be some difference in sales tax rates as rates within
states are usually based on vendor location. Also some types of purchases
for some types of businesses/organizations/entities have various sales tax
exemptions or surcharges, again all of which varies by state & locality.
ALL of these factors will skew the distribution, eg. sales tax is usualy
*.00% or *.25%, *.50%, *.75% etc. so a cursory look shows that 0 & 5 will
be over represented due to this factor.

A real good book with a fair amount of details is Peter Wright's great
book "Spycatcher". The clueless media concentrated on Wright's allegation
that Sir Roger Hollis, head of MI5 was a Soviet mole or the "5th Man"
of the Philby, Burgess, Maclean & Blunt spyring. Now Wright may have been
in Jesus Angleton's psychotic "wilderness of mirrors" too long, but he
did a lot of bugging & stuff w/ GCHQ & he spends a great deal of his book
talking about precisely the Venona decrypts. Briefly there was some reuse
of "one time pads". He gives a fair amount of detail, & I suspect this is
why HRM Govt. was so displeased, the supposed "embarrassment" of the
allegations against long dead Sir Roger being just a cover story & much
easier for the tabloids & general public to understand.
