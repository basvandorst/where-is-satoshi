Last night, C-SPAN carried a public session from the WEF meeting held last February in Davos, Switzerland.  It looked like a chorus of kinder gentler totalitarians, fascists, and Big Brothers.  Louis Freeh, speaking in bureaucratese, said it was time to create an international police force, stamp out uncrackable encryption, and enlist business as allies in implementing the total surveillance state.  Elie Wiesel, guru of Humanism from Boston U., was more direct and explicitly called for an international police force to protect us from nuclear terrorists and other bogeymen.
One bright note:  Freeh said a recent poll of interest to his bureau discovered that 10% of Americans believe the U.S. government was complicit in the Oklahoma City bombing.  Maybe there is hope after all.
