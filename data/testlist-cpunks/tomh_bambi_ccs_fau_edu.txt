If the govt and all its agencies used Clipper for all their communications,
they would be vulnerable to attack from foreign govts that have bought the
keys from spys.  Despite being in escrow, I can't imagine they are really
as secure as everyone seems to think.  If random govt agencies can get the
keys for legal wiretaps, spys will also be able to do so.
Does Clinton have the right to listen in on NSA communication?  If he tried
he might find that they aren't using Clipper internally (or that they keys
aren't in the proper escrow locations).

Any software for hiding data in fractals would have the problem that
people would eventually learn to recognize the type of fractal.  Thus
when the FBI digs through your PC, they'd find the fractals, and recognize
them as data carriers.	Hiding data in arbitrary .jpg files would solve
this problem, but even so, if the FBI knows there is software for
hiding data in the low bits of .jpg files, they'd run it on all your
pictures as a matter of course.  Naturally you'll have encrypted your
file, but you may as well have left it on the disk as is.
a) What's stenography?
b) What's stegography?
c) There's nothing self-decrypting about a .jpg file.

Most people couldn't care less.  They don't encrypt data, and will
never use a clipperphone.  The FBI can *already* listen to all their
phone calls and see all their medical records.	Why should people
do anything to protect something they don't have anyway?

Perry says:
And if the FBI could listen in, it would be *no different* from what
they have today.  The point is, Clipper does not take anything away
from most people.  They might get a Clipperphone if they thought the
building superintendant was hiding in the phone closet listening in
(thus getting some real value from the thing), but they aren't hiding from
the FBI today, and they won't care if the FBI might listen in tomorrow, too.
Note that I'm not saying that Clipper isn't the tip of an iceberg giving
the spooks bigbrother-like powers.  All I'm saying is, you won't be able to
convince Joe Public that he's losing anything.
If they start arresting people for using PGP, that's another problem,
and Joe Public won't care about that, either.

Since this is from ATT, I have to ask: does it have backdoors for the feds?
