Interested in coding on Tor and getting paid for it by Google? If you
are a student, we have good news for you: We have been accepted as a
mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code 2013!
Here are the facts: The summer of code gives you the opportunity to
work on your own Tor-related coding project with one of the Tor
developers as your mentor. You can apply for a coding project related
to Tor itself or to one of its many supplemental projects...
Your mentor will help you when you're stuck with your project and
guide you in becoming part of the Tor community. Google pays you 5,000
USD for the three months of your project, so that you can focus on
coding and don't have to worry about how to pay your bills.
Did we catch your attention? These are your next steps: Go look at the
Google Summer of Code FAQ [1] to make sure you are eligible to
participate. Have a look at our ideas list [2] to see if one of those
projects matches your interests. If there is no project on that list
that you'd want to work on, read the documentation on our website [3]
and make up your own project idea! Come to  on OFTC [4] and
let us know about your project idea. Communication is essential to
success in the summer of code, and we're unlikely to accept students
we haven't heard from before reading their application. So really,
come to the IRC channel and talk to us!
Finally, write down your project idea using our template [5] and
submit your application to Google until May 3, 2013 [6].
We are looking forward to discussing your project idea with you!

@_subject: [tor-dev] Damian's Status Report - July 2013 
Hi all. This month was mostly spent on non-tor work including a server
migration, bad service outage at work, and a full week of cleaning my
apartment. Still, plenty of spiffy news in stem land...
Remote Descriptor Fetching
Major feature for this month was the addition of a module to remotely
fetch tor descriptors...
This works much like tor itself does, downloading descriptor content
from directory authorities and mirrors. With it we can now easily script
against the present state of the tor network without piggybacking on a
live tor instance.
Curious what you can use it for? See our present monitors for some ideas...
This also included a little work with Nick on the spec and tor side...
* Dropped the unimplemented microdescriptor query from the spec. (
* Noting the max queryable fingerprints/hashes in spec. (
* We're getting a high failure rate on the downloads we make. A little
  more investigation is needed on my part to help narrow this down. (
Other news includes...
* Revised the appearance of stem's frontpage. The blue buttons were pretty
  jarring, so switched to something that matches the rest of the page...
    * Added Slackware to our download page. Many thanks to Markus for adding us
  to SlackBuilds!
  * Worked with Sreenatha to port Tor Weather to stem. Unfortunately Weather
  does not presently have an active maintainer so I'm not sure how we will
  proceed on this front. (
  * The Munich dev meeting has attracted quite a few potential volunteers. After
  discussing prospective projects with seros I tidied up our volunteer page.
  Changes included...
  * Added Christian's Globe project
    * Dropped Thandy
    * Merged TorStatus into the entry for Atlas
    * General page corrections
  * Our automated Jenkins test runs ran into another regression in tor that
  caused it to segfault. (
* STREAM events mishandled IPv6 addresses. (caught and patched by soult, * Thread with Pierre about TorPylle which turned into a discussion with Nick
  regarding future language direction for the tor codebase. I'm looking
  forward to seeing where it goes!
  * We just finished with midterms for Google Summer of Code. Chang
  unfortunately did not pass, but the other projects are going well.
* Sorted out travel arrangements for the GSoC mentor summit. Nick and I will
  be going, and Moritz is presently on the waitlist.
* Code reviewed ra's rttprober. He provided some great feedback for which I
  still owe him a reply.
  Cheers! -Damian
