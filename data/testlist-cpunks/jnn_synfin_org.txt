These horrific spring floods weren't common in the 90s when I was in Texas. Or maybe I was too stoned to notice.
We got 30 inches of snow just outside DC in MD this winter, something that hasn't happened in... well, since before I came up here. Greenland permafrost is fucking melting. But I've only born witness to that indirectly.
I think it's pretty obvious we are fucked here if we don't make some changes. Maybe this is fermi's great filter.

a minimum of ~3ft bt 2100.  And sea levels won't magically stop raising
at 2100. This spells fucking catastrophe for major coastal cities

I couldn't say whether FreeBSD has as good an end user desktop experience, although I suspect it should, assuming your hardware supported.

This is direct quote from your first nasa link :  "While rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the air can be beneficial for plants, it is also the chief culprit of climate change. The gas, which traps heat in Earth’s atmosphere, has been increasing since the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood for energy and is continuing to reach concentrations not seen in at least 500,000 years. The impacts of climate change include global warming, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and sea ice as well as more severe weather events."

Do any gmail users (which I've noticed there a lot of on the list,

is doing with access to your entire mail stream? They've publicly
stated users have no "reasonable expectation of privacy".  Do you use gmail for your main / private / important emails, in
addition to list correspondence?
Or do you consider the internet so pwned that it doesnt matter? (although, why make it easier for them..)
I'm just curious... I started getting squeamish about it myself a
good few years back, before snowden, just because it seems like an
obviously bad idea to house all my correspondence at the HQ of one
of the biggest corporations in the world, for them to play with, mine,
and cross-index for targeted advertising as they see fit..
Setting up your own mail server
(postfix+spamassasin+...clamav+..whatever) isn't really that hard,
although you gotta pay a hosting fee, depending on how you decide
to do it. And I guess there are other alternatives to gmail
that are much better in this area, although I'm still inclined

Yes, I'm well aware of this distinction :) However, I consider it a fair trade off against consolidating all my email and contacts in plain text to google. You have to pick your
battles. Find a hosting provider you can trust, or at least think
you can trust, HEH.
Alternatively, just lease a small 1U box. I had this service for free for like 10 years working at various ISPs.
Of course, you STILL don't control any of the switching or routing
fabric or whatever netwitness style gestapo software they may be running outside your rack... and this is true even if you were to
run everything at home off your personal cable modem/DSL. You don't

When you've built a tolerance and don't fall out in a nod, opiates can be extremely stimulating .... I've had 8 hour bouts of creativity from opiate high more times than I can count, hacking code, pursuing intellectual interests, etc.... Of course the caveat here is the looming threat of addiction.
Then again, methamphetamine will give a similar stimulating experience, even more focused, for 24 hours+.... but the accompanying crash is awful IMO, and it sometimes gives me unwanted anxiety.

An open letter to security researchers and practitioners:
We need you to take a stand to protect security researchers who report
defects in browsers, before it's too late.
Earlier this month, the World Wide Web Consortium's Encrypted Media
Extensions (EME) spec progressed to Draft Recommendation phase. This is
a controversial standard for transmitting DRM-encumbered videos, and it
marks the very first time that the W3C has attempted to standardize a
DRM system.
This means that for the first time, W3C standards for browsers will fall
under laws like the DMCA (and its international equivalents, which the
US Trade Representative has spread all over the world). These laws allow
companies to threaten security researchers who disclose vulnerabilities
in DRM systems, on the grounds that these disclosures make it easier to
figure out how to bypass the DRM.
Last summer, the Copyright Office heard from security researchers about
the effect that DRM has on their work; those filings detail showstopper
bugs in consumer devices, cars, agricultural equipment, medical
implants, and voting machines that researchers felt they couldn't
readily publish about, lest they face punitive lawsuits from the
companies they embarrassed.
EFF has asked the W3C to take a minimal step to insulate their
stakeholders from the legal fallout from the inclusion of DRM in their
standards. Our proposal asks the W3C to bind its members to legal
promises not to use the DMCA or laws like it against security
researchers or implementers.
So far, the W3C executive has failed to act on this proposal, despite
diverse support from a number of W3C members.
We are hosting an open letter from security, privacy and technology
experts to the W3C's director, Tim Berners-Lee; and its CEO, Jeff Jaffe,
asking them to make any further work on EME contingent on adopting rules
to protect the open web from these bad laws.
Will you sign this letter? Some of security's leading lights have
already put their names to it. We can't afford to make widely used tools
like browsers off-limits to security research and disclosure, especially
not as HTML5 is being positioned as a UI environment to replace apps as
the primary way of interacting with sensors, actuators, embedded systems
and the whole Internet of Things.
If you're willing to sign on, please send an email to cory at eff.org with
your country of residence and your institutional affiliation (if any).
Thank you,

Wtf is or was so important about Appelbaum that would lead to any kind of massive conspiratorial smear campaign? Who gains from taking him down? He may talk about him a lot, but he's not Julian Assange.
Maybe he was just a douche bag with a few people too many and they threw up some exaggerated reports to get him chucked.
In any event, he doesn't seem to be fighting back particularly hard.

I absolutely agree with everything you've said about Assange, and fully
think his interment in Ecuador (the embassy) stems from the massive he caused and continues to cause to governments, corporations, etc.
I don't know enough about what Appelbaum ever did beyond some (IMO) "art projects" and name-dropping Assange every 5 minutes in that internal tor
IRC chat that was leaked. So, seeing I have a lack of knowledge here,
I'll take you at your word at his importance.
Perhaps you're right!  :)

Up till now its been a basically useless service (IMO), although the new keybase filesystem feature actually looks interesting....
-------- Original Message --------
 From: "Keybase.io"   Dear nixen,
  CHRIS [1] (CHRIS at CHRISCOYNE.COM) just granted you 15 more Keybase
invitations, which you can send to friends. Please use them wisely! The
signup queue is > 25,000 people long right now, and this bypasses the
line entirely.
  There are now TWO WAYS to invite people:
  1. THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY. Use the tab on the top of the website [2].
  2. BY SHARING ENCRYPTED FILES in the Keybase filesystem [3]. Just drop
files in a folder with you and _username at service_, such as
end-to-end encryption. A popup window will arise, like the godhead at
dawn, and tell you what happens next. That is our prophesy.
  _Either way, you're now invited to play with the Keybase filesystem.
Make sure to run the latest Keybase [4] app._
  Thanks,
[1] [2] [3] [4]

Right on. I obviously didn’t keep abreast of all the important
Applebaum-works (I don’t watch a whole lot of youtube videos, I
prefer reading).  I run a little tor relay, lurk on a couple of tor
lists, am constantly hacking my fork of roundcube to work better with
GPG, etc… but basically I've always had more of an interest in the
technical details.  So apparently I missed some important shit.
As I already said to Zen - thanks for filling me in :P
P.S.  All sarcasm/snide bullshit aside - do you really think Applebaum
is of the same level of importance to the things you mention -
privacy / human rights / surveillance state, etc, as Julian Assange
or Ed Snowden?  Snowden may have clammed up but he got a lot of
good shit out there. Likewise they have tried to clam Assange up
but he keeps on pumping shit out.

The first time I ever tried to install Linux was on a 286 in I think 1995 (I lagged on quality computers as a kid).
I downloaded the kernel source from a BBS at 9600 baud and got totally fucking confused with what to do with the resulting tgz file.... Eventually I was able to extract it in DOS, but of course it was still unusable... Linux needs 32bit and you can't install from a kernel source archive...
Anyway I got a Pentium 120 a year or two later and figured it out. Never really looked back. Used a lot of Solaris in late 90s as well - netras were reasonably cheap (are dirt cheap now)

His opsec was horrible even aside from tor. He kept all his torchat logs archived on his laptop, in addition to journals describing the entire creation of the silk road, including the (ridiculous) "murder contracts", etc.
But they did find his "hidden" server and get it cloned before all of this, so blaming tor is not unreasonable.

is that Western society has collapsed and the Islamic countries

Depending on which phone you have and which ROM you flash onto it,
you can get an Android phone that is -mostly- independent of the
Google ecosystem - an independent app store (F-droid), firefox as
the browser, different mail clients (k-9, etc)…. different EVERYTHING,
basically, but the core system for managing the UI, and connecting
to networks/making calls/etc.  I mean, yes, you are still running google code at the core of the thing - but you can get some distance.
E.g. -
Over the years I’ve played with dozens of ROMs on a handful of
different android phones… its fun screwing around with them.
I’ve gotta keep an iPhone for work, and honestly the iPhone 5s looks
like a piece of fucking junk compared to my nexus 6.

Agree!  I do code all the time at work but it's mostly script fu, shell scripts, or, increasingly porting perl to Python or expanding old perl code.
I haven't written more than a few lines of C for like 10 years. Keep meaning to look into using Android Studio or XCode... But always end up back in vim, hacking on little unixy stuff ;)

I don't think Zen's point can be stressed enough... There is literally so much out there, if you really want to learn something well it's important to develop a little tunnel vision, verging on myopia, until you have sufficient mastery... At which point you can branch back out to a broad view and see how your new understanding of  informs future research & learning endeavors...
I have this exact problem myself.

We live in an absurd police state (police world, largely), where jackbooted thugs regulate what you put into your own body. What fucking right does any government have to say about what drug I want to eat, smoke or shoot? Is it my body or isn't it?
Fuck cops, fuck the judicial system, and fuck all the politicians out there who think they are doing important work, so many foul cogs in a disgusting, suffocating, broken machine.

And they sure paid a high fucking price for it! Maybe things would've gone better if Stalin hadn't purged all the competent military personnel in the 30's....  but, no denying they turned it around. Hitler and Stalin

I'm not familiar with the anecdote you mention, but it sounds like
he was acknowledging his own cult of personality..  Anyway, I was
being  slightly hypberbolic when I said "mad".
I read a biography of Stalin like 6 months ago by a guy named
Khlevniuk, and the picture of Koba was not one of insanity per se..
but he was filled with paranoia, extremely crafty, and took a "kill
first" policy with anyone that could possibly pose a threat.  He
was actually planning a bunch of Jewish pogroms when he died in 53.
Beria was said to have danced in glee around the still-living but
paralyzed Stalin after his fatal stroke... of course, Beria was one
sick puppy himself.

I won't bother to defend any politician or state. The US is built on slavery and genocide. That doesn't make Stalin a good guy.

So, it seems that, maybe, perhaps, Litvinenko wasn't directly
assassinated by the FSB (or whatever the Russian security service
calls itself these days...). I mean, maybe he wasn't, but who gives
a fuck?
Even if the polonium didn't originate in Russia (I think they were
able to pin-point which reactor it came out of, but setting that
aside..), I still can't understand cheerleading for ANY of the major
nation-states out there... they are all some twist on the same
corrupt, nepotic, oligarchic/plutocratic template.  Even if Putin
is the fucking hero of the world (because he didnt kill Litvinenko,
makes good speeches, doesn't take bribes), there's still all sorts of
absurd shit going on in that country and in EVERY OTHER country in the world.
Do you really think Putin wants to destroy American hegemony
without utterly replacing it?

 I wonder if it's even that high? Err no pun intended. I think you'd be a fool to purchase dope over tor.. there are still indictments coming down on low level buyers all over the world, fallout from the first and second Silk Road busts.
Also, unless you're looking for somewhat rare entheogens, in general the prices online are way jacked up. I still make all my transactions the old fashioned way - I just feel like agora etc are crawling with Feds and scammers.  Risk reward ratio doesn't balance out when the shit so readily available anyway.
