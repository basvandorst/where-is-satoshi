@_subject: Questions/Comments on ecash protocol 
thank you for the sterling analysis.  I for one am following this with enormous interest, even though some of the details are lost on me right now.
I can't recall if you were party to the earlier thread on "digital coin launderies", and I know some of it was off line.  I hope you will keep some of the following in mind as you go.
One of the major questions about digicash/MTB$ is whether and how money
might be laundered.  The question subsumes the following (among others): 1) What information about Charlie/customer is encoded onto the coin? (There must be some, right, since the serial number is blinded?)  Since the
bank doesn't know what serial number it is signing, it needs to put info about Charlie onto the coin so that it can track him down if he double spends.  Lacking such info, the bank can refuse to honor a double-spent coin, but has no way to know who the double-spender is.
2) How does Charlie (customer) software store the coin internally?
3) Is there a way [how hard is it] for charlie to extract a coin and either    (i) copy it and/or    (ii) send it to David [3rd party] in such a way that David could insert it into David's MTB software and then spend it to Sam without Sam or the Bank noticing that anything was wrong.  If Charlie and David do this, David now has a coin that is from his point of view both payee and payor anonymous, although Charlie has a risk that David will double-spend and expose Charlie to the bank's wrath.
4) what information if any is encoded onto a coin when Charlie spends it to Sam?

These scenarios only matter if the blinded coins have payer info coded into them.  With zero payer info you are correct they are irrelevant.  I was operating under the (incorrect, it seems) assumption that the blinded coins followed what I now understand to be the OFF-LINE ONLY version of the protocol.  In that version, where the blinded coin issued to Alice has info about her coded on to it and/or there is information about payee encoded onto the coin, then such exchanges are necessary to create payee Even with the current protocol, you can achieve payee anonymity if you send a coin to a coin clearinghouse that deposits for you.  Alice gives Bob a coin for value.  Bob turns the coin over to Carol who, for a small fee, deposits the coin.  Now bank knows carol deposited the coin, but knows of neither Bob nor Alice.   Indeed Bob need have no account at the bank at all.  I recognize that there are issues here, esp. for Bob -- does he wait on line while Carol clears the coin before telling Alice that payment cleared (delays?).  Or does he bear the risk?

Imagine you are in the Justice Dept.  You have to work out a policy for escrow agents because your boss says so.  You begin to work out scenarios, just like when you design software.  One scenario is that the FISA court issues a warrant for a wiretap/decrypt of a suspected foreign agent.  The fact of the order, and esp. the ID of the target, have a SECRET classification.  It is a crime to show a SECRET document to a person without clearance.  Yet, escrow agents can reasonably refuse to disclose a key (indeed, SHOULD refuse to disclose a key) without seeing a real warrant.  How do you solve the problem?  (Hint: asking Congress to change either the classification laws, the FISA court rules, or the GAK policy are not I'm certain the above was a large part of their thinking in adding the
requirement of a SECRET cleared person.  If you accept their premises --
note the "if" -- it makes a certain degree of sense.  I offer the following two bets for which I have no evidence:
1) This will be the PR that most damages the proposal
2) If they ever actually implement the policy, they will give the clearances out as fast as they can, just to show good faith.  Not that SECRET is a very high clearance any more, anyway....It's main value is in giving them another way to jail you if you leak the fact of the order and it ruins the investigation.  (Plus, I suppose, obstruction of justice...)

way to have escrow agents who would be "oblivious" to the identity of the

@_subject: ecash remailer 
Now I am fully confused.
I thought a property of Chaumian DigiCash was that a coin *had* to go back
to the bank before it could be spent again.  Yet all "coin exchange"
schemes discussed here recently involve Alice paying Bob who then sends
the coin to Carol's Exchange who then sends it to the bank while sending
some other value, maybe a Carol coin, to Bob. Logically, I can see at least four possibilities:
1) payee data is encoded onto the coin at time of payment, making it impossible for Carol to bank the coin.  I see no evidence of this in the docs at the Digicash site, but I just rechecked quickly and may have missed it.
2) No payee data as such is encoded on the coin but it is marked "spent" to prevent multiple uses by payee to the detriment of payor.  ditto on the evidence.
3) the Digicash software only allows you to send a "spent" coin to the bank.  You have to hack the software to send the coin to Carol (do you have to break your own key?).
4) nothing in the DigiCash software or protocol prevents you from sending a coin to Carol so long as you trust Carol not to get you in trouble by misusing the coin in some way.  That's why Chaum is interested in hardware based agents that would keep you from respending coins you receive.
No doubt there are others.  Anyone know what the reality is?

I am delighted to discover that there is a person in this world who reads the ITAR more broadly than I do.  I can see how the ITAR could be read to reach a Frenchman who sends crypto via email to a German that happens, through no fault of his own, to be routed via New York; we might have to talk about whether the scienter requirment would mean that M. Frenchman knew or should have known about the routing.  [NB "could be read" does not equal "should be read".]
Not even I, however, would imagine that any court anywhere, could read the ITAR or the legislation authorizing it (which is more to the point) as reaching two foreigners talking abroad, neither of whom is a US person.
Not only does the US lack the jursidction to make such a rule, it has never sought to make such a rule in any context I am aware of (no, foreign wars don't count).  Not even in anti-trust or securities, where the extraterritorial jurisdictional assertions are premised on the effects of the foreign act to the US market...

[Note that this small disagreement between PDJ and me should not obscure our larger areas of agreement...]
To reiterate my point in legalese:  any court construing the ACEA would
inevitably read the prohibition on "exporting" to a foreign person as not
applying where the nation lacks jurisdiction.  This is not even a case of
applying a construction to save the constitutionality of the statute
(since it could well take a narrower construction to do that).  It's just
common sense, which courts actually resort to on occasion. In short, in this particular case the ACEA, and by extention the ITAR,
doesn't "say what it says"  it "says what it must mean".  This is an
important way in which legal parsing differs from compiling... I'd be interested in hearing more about why you say the ITAR violates
separation of powers: because it gives the executive branch too much power
to define the elements of a criminal offense? A. Michael Froomkin        | +1 (305) 284-4285; +1 (305) 284-6506 (fax)

Technically, this is holding the regulations ultra vires, not unconsitutional; the difference matters.
Note the change in fact pattern: now both foreigners are IN the US where indeed they are subject to US law.  My bet: the court has no trouble applying the ITAR to these facts and convicting.  I agree this is a little silly; but not silly enough to stop it.  [The government will argue, and win, as follows: suppose there is no law against murder in either of the nations they come from.  Does that mean they can kill each other here?]
This issue is now in front of two district judges.
Won't need it.  He has committed no offense.  If his petition is turned down, he has a right of action.
Without evidence, they will lose.  Even with evidence, not obvious he has done anything wrong.
They lose.  You distinguish it easily ("Now where exactly was the defendant at the time, Mr. US Atty?  Germany?  Case dismissed.")
Ah. Terminological confusion.  That's not a constitutional violation.  It's an agency misconstruing a statute, renderinig the regulations invalid.
See the Administrative Procedures Act....
It's too far off topic to pursue any further, but I must take exception to the suggestion that we are well served by separation of powers intruding into other legal domains.  Bowsher tells us that causation principles go out the window in SOP cases.  That alone makes it radioactive.

[sorry for the delay, things are busy here, and apologies too for the length of this thing...]
Misunderstanding, piled on misunderstanding, piled on disagreement.
I'll try to focus on the big points, and let the small stuff slide.
Let the record show that Prof. Junger and I still agree on lots of stuff that's outside this debate.  I wasn't trying to attack him before, and I'm not trying to start a flamewar now.
Main point for the busy:  Claims that the US government could apply the ITAR to 2 foreigners abroad and get a US court to buy it are, IMHO, [....the Itar is unconstitutional....]
I would say it anywhere.  Some days I would even claim to be one of those Nope.  Never said it, didn't mean it.  I mean a good ol' garden variety US federal court.
Here's a misunderstanding (for which I'm happy to take full responsibility).  What I meant by the "ultra vires" point is this:
There are lots of ways in which an agency action can be struck down by the courts.  Two of them are:
1) The agency interpreted the statute correctly, but the statute was unconstitutional -- beyond Congress's powers under the constitution.
2) The agency interpreted the statute Incorrectly, and tried to do something beyond the powers delegated to it by congress (the nice thing about this is that one doesn't even reach the issue of whether Congress could, in theory, have delegated the power in question).
That's what I meant by my ultra vires assertion.  Type (2) above.  So we agree in a sense as to what this problem is -- but I call this a case of an agency misconstruing the statute, not a "separation of powers" problem.
Let's assume, for the argument, that I'm wrong and that the agency read the statute reasonably (note under Chevron it doesn't have to read it "right" just reasonably).  Does the agency read the statute to apply to two foreigners talking on the beach at Calais?  No it does not.   Did Congress intend the statute to be applied to the two foreigners?  No
evidence that it did. Would or should a court read the statute to apply to two foreigners etc.
in the absence of a clear direction from Congress to that effect? No. Why not?  Two main reasons.  One is the one you identify:
The other one is that even if Congress had the jurisdiction, the court would be reluctant to read the statute that way, with the implications for foreign relations, comity, etc etc without clear directions to do so.  And if you think the court would just formalistically follow the words of the statute, see eg Church of the Holy Trinity, 143 US 457 and its progeny.
I cannot imagine that the court would do anything but dismiss on these facts. Note that now we are more explicit that in the ACEA.
There are a number of other arguments he could make.  E.g. denial of due process for lack of notice.  Unconstitutionality of the statute as exceeding the powers of congress as a violation of international law.  A weaker argument would be an analogy to the ex post facto clause -- now the government seeks to apply its laws to him after the fact.  I do not think that the Neuremburg precedent would be contrary, since the claim of the US there was that some laws of man and nations are always in force everywhere.  Restrictions on crypto exports does not fall in that class.
A vast and unhelpful oversimplification.  what do you mean by "such cases"?  Criminal prosecutions of US citizens for messing in foreign policy is one thing; criminal prosecutions of foreigners for acts that have foreseeable effects here is another thing; criminal prosecutions on the facts above is a whole different thing.
It is certainly true that as Justice Jackson put it, the powers of those branches are greatest when they agree.  But the constitution trumps all.  I do not agree.  See above.
But no.  First there is the constitutional arguments.  Then there is the idea that we interpret the statute to avoid the constitutional and international problems.  Then there is the problem that there are no grounds to think that Congress ever intended to reach foreigners in such cases (and Holy Trinity Church, 143 US 457 (1892) still gets cited (despite its anachronistic view of religion)).
I think many district judges, most appellate judges, and almost every supreme court justice would at least reject, if not laugh at, that argument.  The trend is away from assertions of jurisdiction over foreigners without minimum contacts, e.g. Asahi (sp?).
I'm sorry, but everything that follows the line above is irrelevant.  If
there are other grounds to prosecute, the court will use those and avoid
the constitutional problem.  If the foreigner isn't really foreign, then
he's not a foreigner.  I'm going to respond in detail anyway because I
think that the FUD factor may be coming in to play... I don't see what dual criminality has to do with this.  Am I supposed to be on notice that if I do an illegal thing here to my neighbor, I'm supposed to be at risk of prosecution in Sri Lanka?  Anyway, recall that in the original hypo foreigner A is talking *legally* to foreigner B.  Even if they are not, it's not within the competence of the US government to do anything about it.  Nor -- I have to say this over and over and over and over -- has the US government ever asserted in any form that it would seek to do anything about this.  Just because an over-literal reading of a regulation could lead to that view does not equal an actual assertion of jurisdiction by the government.
Not relevant.  Note, by the way, that on these facts the "export" was by the (us person?) who taught the foreigner crypto in the US, not later.
Not relevant.  Not a foreigner, or the export is traced to a non-foreigner who then is the one charged with the ITAR violation.
So what? The people are still outside the US.
I invite you to consider the recent decision of the 9th circuit that foreigners in the US have full 1st Am. rights.  Of course, the position of the would-be enterant is not the same as the position of even the temporary visitor to our shores, since constitutional rights don't attach to foreigners until they are in the country, but the language of that case is very suggestive.
Yes, litigation is expensive.  The foreign person unjustly excluded on this hypo will spend the time at home, writing crypto for profit, and reducing our tax base.  Meanwhile academic lawyers such as us will be representing her free of charge.  The government is sometimes unjust; even when you win against it you are worse off often than if you hadn't had to fight.  That's a wholly different issue from whether you win in court, which is what I thought we were arguing about.
Speak for yourself please.
I do not accept this accusation.  I assert that my "solution" to the
"problem" of whether a court would allow a criminal prosecution of a
foreigner, however "evil", for discussing crypto with another foreigner in
a foreign locale absent the most explicit and direct instructions from
Congress is the correct one: probability near zero.  Direct, clear
instructions from Congress supported by a legislative history or
legislative findings that made it clear that this was a result Congress
intended would raise the probability considerably, but I'd still bet on
the court striking the statute down as violating due process.
The academy is part of the real world.  All so-called real world questions
are fit subjects for academic study.  Much of my work is inspired by
concrete problems, or is (I hope) applicable to them.  Some of my work is
more abstract.  They applications are less immediate.  I'm proud of that
too. It at least as dangerous to believe that a court will formalistically apply text as if statutory construction, especially in the shadow of the constitution, were a mechanistic process.
This is a fair point.  The facts *do* matter.  This is why "hard cases make bad law."  But the fact that you can do so is part of the reason why rubber hoses are less common than they would otherwise be.

This discussion puzzles me.  I thought we were bombarded with reputational goods all the time:  brand names, stocks (what is a purchase in the 2ndary market but a purchase of reputation most of the time?), degrees from famous universities.  Anonymity compliates matters only if no systems of unique ID is used.  Throw in digital signatures and we are back at brand names, aren't we?

Actually, the application of the law tends to be far more reasonable than non-lawyers believe.  This is one of the hardest things to get law students to believe.  But it is a human process, not a mechancial one.
If you sell a product legally in the US, taking reasonable precautions to
observe the ITAR and making clear to your customers what their obligations
are, you have essentially zero risk.  How do I know this?  Many, many,
many people do exactly that every day, and none have AFAIK even been
threatened with prosecution.  This is NOT IMHO how the ITAR restricts intra-US trade.  The ITAR restrict intra-US trade by inducing people to make only exportable products so that they don't have the trouble of supporting two different versions, doing 2 kinds of paperwork, etc.
OTOH, if you hand software to someone to put on an FTP site, nudge, nudge, wink, wink let's hope it doesn't get exported, ha, ha, then you really are guilty of trying to end-run the ITAR, and they feds may give you a hard time, which after all is their job if you are breaking federal None of this of course goes to the question of whether the ITAR is good/bad or un/constitutional.

@_subject: Cypherpunk Certification Authority 
Alas, certain critical social steps have been elided in the proposed protocol.  As it happens, I'm working on an article, to be published in the Oregon Law Review next year, on "The Importance of Trusted Third Parties in Electronic Commerce".  It's mostly about the care and feeding (and legal liability!) of a CA.  Unfortunately for this discussion, I'm only part way through my thinking about what the liability of a CA might be so I don't have carefully considered conclusions to offer you.  Try me again in a few weeks.
In the absence of legislation...
[PLUG:  if you haven't already done so, RUSH to my homepage
and click on the link to the ABA draft of the digital signature guidelines.  This mis-named document is actually all about CA liability.  Comment period now extended to mid-January.]
...you need to worry about who might *use* the certificates, and what they
might to do the CA in the case of mis-certification or other misfortune. At the very least, there is a tort claim for "negligent
mis-representation" the first time an inaccurate certificate, or an
accurate certificate referencing a compromised key, is used in a
transaction that goes sour. I don't give legal advice on line, ever, so I can't tell you how to avoid
liability. I'm not even sure that this is possible absent legislation.  I
can, however, mention techniques that at this writing seem to me to be an
essential part of any liability-reduction strategy, without any claim that
these alone suffice to protect you to the level that I would want to be
protected (I'm a cautious guy). Repeat: I do claim that pending further thought these steps seem necessary, **not** that they are sufficient:
A) Establish a clear certification policy document, describing in detail what checks are made before issuing a certificate, how quickly CRLs are posted, and where.  This doesn't mean onerous checks are necessary, just that you need to be clear as to what checking a certficiate from you emboidies.  Publish this document.
B) Reference this policy document in every certificate.
C) Don't settle for less than X.509 ver 3, because this allows the certificate to carry within it a reference to the location of the CRL list.  Use that feature.
D) Establish a very reliable mechanism to ensure CRLs are posted where and when they should be.
E) Use a secure, trusted, computer system.
Again, I note that this is NOT a complete list of what you need to do. For more inspiration consult the ABA document referenced above. A. Michael Froomkin        | +1 (305) 284-4285; +1 (305) 284-6506 (fax)

there are implementations that assign a new IP address to every login, I
understand the current norm to be static IP addresses.  I sure have one. Thus, if you keep a file of my IP address, and a fact about that address,
you have a database that can be purchased and correllated with another DB,
which links IP to somehting else, eg telephone numbers (perhaps from a

Get competent legal advice.  I.e. don't ask me.  As a general rule, I know of two principles that might be relevant here: 1) US and Canada rules on export control tend to be very similar; 2) lots of US rules apply to US persons abroad, not just income tax.

For your personal situation you *must* get competent legal advice.  I.E. pay someone who makes it a point to stay more current in this stuff than I do.  I recommend Lee Tien, for example, or Ken Bass.  I bet Lee is less expensive :>.  This note is NOT legal advice, and may not be competent since it is research-free.  It would not be wise to make any important decisions on the basis of this note.
As a general matter, however, if you are a US person and give crypto to a foreign person (be it a real person or a corporation), then as a technical legal matter you are in violation of the ITAR. US law doesn't ordinarily cover non-us corporations abroad (but see some
anti-trust and money laundering rules), but the ITAR will cover any US
person (ie citizen or green card holder) who works for them or transacts
with them. Off the top of my head, I don't know whether the acquisition of totally
foreign-created crypto by a foreign corporation managed, owned or
controlled by a US person becomes an ITAR-controlled "export" when that crypto is sold to a non-us person.  I would, however, want a good legal opinion before I exposed myself to the risk as I could sure make a good argument that the ITAR reached that far.  All of this is without prejudice to the issue of whether the ITAR are constitutional...

I don't know.  There are fun legal issues, not all arising from contract here.  In particular, assume for a momement that (1) the goverment offers "escrow" services and/or (2) the government requires that >40 bit encryption products include mandatory US govt-apporved escrow as a precondition for export clearance [the NIST trial balloon].
Under (1) your participation in the escrow is not necessarily "voluntary"; a similar, if less powerful, argument can be made under (2).  Also, when the government provides the "escrow service" different liability rules may apply.

I.   Commercial key escrow, the WHAT, WHY, WHO and HOW
     A.   WHAT      Give someone (internal/external) copies of keys (private/
     symmetric) used in the course of business
          1.   Essential (from corporate perspective) for
               a.   all encrypted, stored corporate data
               b.   keys with power
                    (1)  to sign things in corporate name e.g.
                         buy/sell
                    (2)  to issue certificates
          2.   Less essential (from corporate perspective)
               a.   for email keys
                    but still pretty important if you might have
                    to reconstruct exchanges of messages at a
                    later date.
               b.   for telephone keys
                    although useful if you think there will be
                    need for you and/or police to spy on your
                    employees, eg. investigate fraud/theft.
     B.   WHY
          1.   Irresponsible for corporation not to encrypt data
               and some communications if these are of commercial
               value to competitors/otherwise sensitive
          2.   Irresponsible to encrypt data (and maybe also
               communications) and not have fail-safe means of
               access
               a.   employees lose their keys
               b.   employees die
               c.   employees quit (and vanish or do some vandalism)
               d.   employees are suspected of engaging in hanky-
                    panky
     C.   WHO
          Escrow agent could be           1.   internal
               a.   only viable solution right now unless you are
                    satisfied with, e.g., RSA non-interoperable
                    crypto system
               b.   but are you hacker-proof?
          2.   external, e.g.
               a.   TIS licensed "Data Recovery Center" (but
                    there are none in existence today)
               b.   bankerstrust

          issues are resolved.  E.G.  Suppose private escrow
          agent complies in good faith with facially valid
          warrant, but warrant is l
     D.   HOW
          Here we have more doubts than knowledge
          Not clear yet what security precautions commercial
          escrow agents will offer.  Can assume:
          1.   Secure systems
          2.   Contract-driven mechanism for verifying IDs/bona
               fides of persons attempting to take out data
          3.   Contract-driven assurances of speed of response
          4.   split key systems with different escrow agents?
II.  Legal implications of commercial key escrow
     Three families of issues:           1.   data owner liability for not escrowing
          2.   escrow agent liability for errors
          3.   Government access to keys
     A.   It is irresponsible NOT to escrow keys if you encrypt
          data.  And it is increasingly irresponsible not to
          encrypt.  Hence some form of escrow will become
          practically mandatory.
          1.   Query: won't this make it easier for the
               government to get access to my data?                 Answer: must distinguish between stored data and
               communications.   You are escrowing the keys not
               the data itself.  The data remains secure in your
               own machine/tape/safe/whatever.  There it's
               subject to subpoena just like paper records.  So
               encryption + escrow is no substitute for
               destroying the smoking gun, but it's also no more
               danger than ordinary records.
               Escrowing keys used for communication makes those
               communications more vulnerable to government
               interceptions.  Strong, unescrowed, keys may
               defeat even a lawful subpoena for a wiretap.                Escrowed keys are vulnerable to legal (at least)
               wiretaps.            2.   More on "practically mandatory":  The government
               may make it a condition of doing certain kinds of
               business, e.g. govt contracting, that only
               escrowed encryption be used.   Similarly, the
               government may be willing to engage in secure
               communications with the public, but only via
               system that are limited to escrowed keys.
          3.   Still more on "practically mandatory": carrot &
               stick of export controls (see below).
     B.   Escrow agent liability for errors
          Currently, rights and resp of customer vs. escrow
          agents depend on whether escrow agent is public or
          private
          1.   Public escrow agent -- low accountability?
     In the "Clipper 1" proposals, the escrow system lacked any
legal guarantees for the people whose keys are generated by the
government and held by the escrow agents.  Indeed, the Attorney
General's escrow procedures stated that they      �do not create, and are not intended to create, any
     substantive rights for individuals intercepted through
     electronic surveillance.�  In short, the government disclaimed in advance any reliance
interest that a user of an EES-equipped device might have in the
government's promise to keep the key secret.  A victim of an
illegal wiretap would have a cause of action under Title III
against the wiretapper, but, it appears, no remedy against the
escrow agents, even if the escrow agents acted negligently or
failed to follow their own procedures.  The Attorney General's
procedures themselves are merely directives.  They are not even
legislative rules, which might be subject to notice and comment
restrictions before being rescinded.  A future administration
could, if it wanted, secretly instruct the escrow agents to
deliver copies of the keys to an intelligence or law enforcement
agency, or even White House �plumbers,� thereby violating no law
or regulation (the plumbers, though, would violate Title III when
they used the information).  Because the chip-unique keys were
voluntarily disclosed to the government, the chip's owner might
lack a �legitimate� (that is, enforceable) expectation of privacy
in the information.      If the intercepted communication were an e-mail or a file
transfer, rather than a telephone call, the chip owner subject to
an illegal or inadvertent disclosure by the escrow agents may be
in a particularly weak position if the information ever makes its
way to court:  many Title III protections granted to voice
communications do not apply to transfers of digitized data.
     Shortly before the 103d Congress adjourned, Congressman
George Brown introduced the Encryption Standards and Procedures
Act of 1994, which would have waived the sovereign immunity of
the United States for �willful� but unauthorized disclosures of
key fragments by its officials�and excluded liability in all
other circumstances.  In the absence of similar legislation,
however, there may currently be no monetary remedy even for a
�willful� disclosure.
          2.   Private escrow agent -- contract accountability,
               tort, maybe bailee/trustee (dubious)
     If you want software key escrow today, you have to be your
own escrow agent, or go to a private escrow agent because there
is no government agency ready and able to act in this capacity
(and few private bodies!)  Given current liability rules, you
would be better off with a private body than the government
anyway (tradeoff: maybe more security in government agency (?)
vs. more recourse against private party).
     The "son of clipper" trial balloon floated this fall
suggested that export permission would be given to (relatively)
strong (ie. 64 bit max) software cryptosystems, if those systems
were designed to ensure that the keys were escrowed with an
"approved escrow agent".  NIST solicited comments in Sept. '95 as
to                a.   what sort of bodies would be suitable, and                b.   what terms and conditions should govern the
                    escrow agents.                 c.   What procedures need to be developed for the
                    storage and safeguarding of keys?
               d.   Performance criteria (e.g., around-the-clock
                    availability, accessibility, reliability,
                    etc.) for approved key escrow agents?
               e.   Under what circumstances will key escrow
                    agents in foreign countries be approved?
               f.   Should approval of key escrow agents be tied
                    to a public key infrastructure (for digital
                    signatures and other purposes)?       [The last point is potentially ominous...if access to
     digital signature infrastructure is conditions on using KE,
     then this makes export control hardball look like small
     beer]
     To date there has been no public feedback from NIST
subsequent to the meeting except that they are revising the
criteria in light of what they heard.  [Can GG tell us more?]
     C.   Government access to keys
          NB that government seems primarily interested in
communications; business main focus is/should be DATA.
     Now with "Son of Clipper" (software KE), the government has
relaxed the suggestion that keys be generated and escrowed via
hardware (e.g. Fortezza), but has substituted onerous criteria it
hopes it can persuade (threaten?) industry to apply to software,
III. (Mostly specious) Arguments Against Commercial Key Escrow
[with apologies to Marc Rotenberg, Electronic Privacy Information
Center, who posted the quoted material to USENET several months
     A.   Bad for business
          1.   "Increased network vulnerability.  The key escrow
               configuration necessarily increases the likelihood
               of communications compromise and improper
               interception by third parties. Computer crime will
               skyrocket."
               Very unrealistic and alarmist.  While as a
               theoretical matter it is clearly true that the
               sharing the keys with the escrow agent must create
               an avenue of attack that did not exist before, the
               risk can be very greatly reduced by                a.   key splitting (never send the whole key to
                    anyone at any time)
               b.   secure communications with very secure
                    algorithms between escrow agent and customer
                    [NB that US government export policy
                    implicates this to the extent it makes strong
                    crypto non-exportable]
          2.   "Policy incoherence.  The key management needs of
               business differ sharply from the real-time
               intercept plans of law enforcement. The latter has
               little to do with the former."
               Probably true, but irrelevant to the matter at
               hand: business needs escrowing for its own
               disaster recovery needs.
          3.   "Complexity.  Has anyone really given thought to
               how many communications will be encrypted in 20
               years and what the key management requirements
               will be to develop a unitary key escrow system to
               satisfy the government's concerns?"
               Maybe, maybe not.  But businesses need CKE now.                Keys don't live for ever, and a sound security
               plan will include provisions for retiring keys as
               they age.  Age makes keys vulnerable
               a.   technological change makes bruting longer
                    keys possible
               b.   the longer the key is out there the more time
                    attackers have to brute (or otherwise
                    compromise) the key
     B.   Bad for civil liberties
          1.   "Emergency circumstances taps.  The current
               wiretap law permits the initiation of a wiretap
               *without court order* upon a certification that
               emergency circumstances exist. If this procedure
               is built into the CKE procedure, then there will
               be *no judicial review* prior to the disclosure of
               keys."
               True.  But these taps are currently rare, and
               limited to cases like kidnapping where lives are
               at stake.  It's fairly unlikely that a business
               will ever encounter one of these.
          2.   "The future of PGP.  Will PGP and other non-escrow
               schemes be permitted if CKE is adopted? What will
               be the implications for developers and companies
               in the communications industry?"
               Voluntary CKE in and of itself is not going to
               affect the legality of alternative un-escrowed
               crypto.  The politics are hard to predict: one can
               imagine arguments that mandatory escrow is not
               needed because it's being done voluntarily; and
               also arguments that the increasing voluntary CKE
               means that there's less reason not to make it
               mandatory.   My guess: no great effect one way or
               the other.  The issue will be settled by larger
               things e.g. what's more scary -- Oklahoma City or
               Ruby Ridge?
IV.  Recent Developments in key escrow
     A.   NIST initiatives
          NIST is currently putting "final touches" on draft
          export criteria, under auspices of inter-agency working
          group. NIST hopes to "notice" revised draft criteria in
          fed register, perhaps within the next month; then a
          60day comment period, with a 1-day live meeting in DC
          sometime during the comment period.
          When NIST has final version of inter-agency
          recommendations set, they will be turned over to the
          state dept to implement; state can do what it likes.           One possible model for State Dept. action is a change
          to the ITAR.
V.   Outstanding Issues
     A.   Why would any foreign company use US govt approved
          crypto in light of new focus on economic intelligence,
          e.g. Japan spy case?
          Possible govt responses:
          1.   foreign govt might have copy of key?  share key?
          2.   foreign-based, but US-approved, escrow agent might
               hold/share key
     B.   MANDATORY CKE?
          1.   Legislation?
          2.   "milder variants"
               a.   export control club (is 64 bits enough?)
               b.   data vs. communications issue
               c.   Digital signature infrastructure access club
                    (informal talks suggest this is not likely,
                    but not formally ruled out....)
     C.   Enabling ("technical") legislation
          1.   Title III exemption for escrow agent
          2.   Authority to "certify" escrow agents
          3.   liability rules for escrow agents
     D.   Enabling regulations
          1.   Care & feeding of escrow agents,                a.   eg. sample criteria for being approved and/or
                    sample contract between government and escrow
                    agent
               b.   performance criteria for escrow agents e.g.
                    response time
     E.   Liability in the absence of legislation
          1.   First, find someone actually selling escrow
               services with an interoperable product.
          2.   Or, resign yourself to eg RSA keys.

The long-delayed ABA draft digital signature guidelines are now available for public comment.  This is potentially an important document, and is worth some time for those interestested in the legal and economic effects of digital signatures.  An internet version and more info can be found at:
The comment period ends Nov 30, 1995, so don't delay.
Due to the ABA's Section on Science and Technology's fear that its
intellectual property will be ripped off, the document is in a strange
"read-only" format, relying on the "Common Ground Mini-Viewer".  The
program has been designed to prevent users from printing their own copy of
the document.  Paper copies can be ordered from the ABA for $15 (see

this user-unfriendly method of distributing the document (it certainly
makes quoting from it in your comments difficult!), but the Chair of the
Committee, Michael Baum, unilaterally removed me from the Committee a few days ago.

And yet people like MIT get approval for the release of PGP this way.
It is clear that 1) the government will (verbally?) clear the "PGP procedure" when pushed.
2) they need to be pushed.
If anyone from MIT is reading this, it would be a real public service to put on a web site (a) what the system used for the release of PGP is exactly and (b) what assurances (oral, written, names & dates) was received from State/Commerce that this was legal.
Publicizing this information would lay the groundwork for APA (or, given

The above is very confusing and stems, IMHO, from imprecise use of terms.
It is important to distinguish between 4 types of remailers: * traceable pseudonymous
* untraceable pseudonymous
* traceable anonymous
* untraceable anonymous
The text quoted above is true if it describes a "traceable pseudonymous" remailer, e.g.  anon.penet.fi.  This is different from, say, a cypherpunks
style remailer. For a full, perhaps tedious, explication of all this and other stuff too, see

Thank you for the thoughtful comments. I agree that the next draft should discuss China more.  I think China could probably clamp down very effectively.  I am not persuaded it could do so without giving up a very large share of the benefits of access.
alas, this is beyond the scope of this essay.  There's a huge literature on this in the law reviews, though.
I agree.  It's not a substitute.  Just an enabler in places that don't choose to practice draconian access control.

I understand from an AP reporter that the judge in the Bernstein
challenge to the ITAR refuesed the motion to dismiss and -- if the
reporter is correct -- held that source code is First amendment speech.
This appears to conflict with the Karn decision that dismissed a somewhat
similar challenge to the ITAR on political question grounds.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
[...] The following summary is from my colleague Shari Steele:
What Judge Patel said.
First, the judge ruled that Bernstein could bring his case even though the
Arms Export Control Act specifically precludes judicial review, because what
we are asking the judge to review (i.e., the constitutionality of the
statute and its regulations) was not what had been precluded (i.e., the
government's determination in a particular instance whether or not something
was exportable).  "With respect to constitutional questions, the judicial
branch not only possesses the requisite expertise to adjudicate these
issues, it is also the best and final interpreter of them."
Next, the judge determined that only the source code was at issue here, not
Bernstein's academic paper describing the source code.  Bernstein tried to
get the government to rule separately on the paper and the code back in 1993
by filing separate CJ requests.  The State Department merged the requests
and rejected them all.  On June 29, 1995, after we filed this suit, the
government sent Dan a letter saying that the paper could be published and
never had been forbidden.  While Judge Patel claimed that the issue of the
paper now appeared to be moot, she commented, "It is disquieting than an
item defendants now contend could not be subject to regulation was
apparently categorized as a defense article and subject to licensing for
nearly two years, and was only reclassified after plaintiff initiated this
Finally, the key ruling in the case.  "This court can find no meaningful
difference between computer language, particularly high-level languages as
defined above, and German or French....Like music and mathematical
equations, computer language is just that, language, and it communicates
information either to a computer or to those who can read it....Thus, even
if Snuffle source code, which is easily compiled into object code for the
computer to read and easily used for encryption, is essentially functional,
that does not remove it from the realm of speech....For the purposes of
First Amendment analysis, this court finds that source code is speech."
This is the first time that we know of that a court has ruled that source
code is speech for First Amendment analysis.  This is a Big Deal - a very
important precedent.  The judge drew an analogy to copyright law, which
treats computer software as a "literary work" and offers it copyright
protection, to help her come to her conclusion.
The judge, therefore, did not throw out any of our claims (the ITAR acts as
a prior restraint on speech, the ITAR is overbroad, and the ITAR is vague).
She looked at each of them one by one and determined that each of them had
What this decision means.
Most directly, it means that we can continue on with our lawsuit.  The
government had brought a motion to dismiss the case, contending that the
court lacked jurisdiction to hear this matter because it was a matter of
national security.  The judge struck that down and said that we can go
forward with our suit.
More indirectly, the judge's ruling sets the stage for us winning at trial.
She clearly "gets it," and isn't intimidated by the government's use of
precedential cases that aren't on point.

Having read the admittedly vague and badly worded statute, I bet you that
an competent court (query whether this includes the first state prosecutor
and trial court that actually are faced with a case) would interpret the
act to apply only to cases where someone infringes on the intellectual
property of another.  If only to avoid constitutional problems. Although as a formal matter EFF are right that the bill's language *could* be
read to apply to all anonymous communication, I don't think EFF has done
us a favor by whipping up panic, because it seems to me relatively unlikely that it *should* or *would* be read that way.  Oh well.  A. Michael Froomkin        | +1 (305) 284-4285; +1 (305) 284-6506 (fax)

@_subject: Certificates: limiting your liability with reuse limitations 
Suppose I am a CA.  I am worried that by issuing a certificate with a lifespan of more than 2 milliseconds I am opening myself up to unlimited liability if for some reason, despite my best efforts, I issue an erroneous certificate.
I know I can write disclaimers, but that's not reliable since courts often ignore them, and anyway it scares off customers.
I know I can put an expiration date on the certificate, but that's not enough.  I can accumulate a lot of exposure in a few seconds, much less I know I can put a reliance limit in the X.509 ver 3 certificate, but that's not enough.  Even a $1 limit could be used many millions of times.
Is it feasabile to say: Can only be relied on once per day/week/month?  Is this something the relying parties can reasonably be expected to monitor?
It seems to me that this sort of a limit is essential if a CA is to feel comfortable outside Utah....

You can give them accounts, but they are still covered by their secrecy oath, so they can't answer questions about what the grand jury did (at least in most jurisdictions, YMMV).   This got very contraversial in the Rocky Flats case, where the grand jurors hired a lawyer to get permission to go public to complain about a failure to prosecute.  I don't recall ever reading about the outcome of that case, so I can't report the result.  If the jurors had won, I would have expected to hear about it.  It may still be pending.

for today?  In answering keep in mind that most US corporate clients are
not too worried about the US government reading their email.  Some do
worry about foreign governments and many worry about competitors. [I've limited this to "non-banking" because banks seem to be gearing up for 3DES.]
2) How long before DES becomes generally unsuitable for (A) corporate (B) personal use [please keep the threat model on which this question is based in mind -- threats *other than* the US government wiretapping you]?
3) Do you have a view as to whether DES (A) will and (B) should be recertified next time the issue arises?

@_subject: Encryption and the 2nd Amendment 
IMHO the 2nd amendment argument is bunk. [I haven't seen the Wired article BTW, so this is just a general point.]
The definition of crypto as arms was accomplished as an administrative
convenience by an agency of the US govt.  It is not a definition of
constitutional significance.  To oversimplify only a little bit, agencies
don't get to define terms in the constitution -- and a good thing too, or
they might try to define e.g. "speech" in some funny way. The issue is whether under any fair reading of the 2nd Am. you can read
"arms" to include encryption.  You might try to do this by "original
intent" (except that I've never seen a shred of evidence for this).  Or
you might try to do it by arguing that the meaning of the term "arms"
should change with the times and crypto fits the purposes (defending your
home?) of the amendment.  But this is a very tough argument to make, and
I've never seen anyone try it.  I suspect it is also bound to fail; indeed
any interpretive system that would stretch the constitutional use of the
word "arms" so wide as to fit crypto could equally well be used to exclude
anything more advanced than muskets and early rifles... which probably explains why I know of no such arguments either.
I must be posting some version of this every nine months or so.  Each time I get hate mail.  Let's make this an exception shall we?

Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.  Donuts to dollars that it's freely importable.
Now, whether you could freely use it becomes another version of the "could they ban strong crypto for domestic use" issue.  I don't think so.  Why?  See my articles on my homepage, I also (to pick on Tim's excellent "you got to think like them" thread)
don't really see why they need to expend massive energies fighting this
battle once it looks lost (I do see why they would want to fight and have
fought delaying actions; every delay is a win in that mindset).  A
cryptographically strong browser isn't such a threat to policy, except
that you get more encrypted traffic messing up traffic analysis, and
that's happening gradually anyway.  Not to mention that traffic volumes
going up must strain some capacity somewhere. No, the real threats to LEAs/traditional ways of doing things are more
likely to be anonymity and anonymous cash.  And these are things that may
well be within the power of governments to at least make difficult if not
eliminate for some time.  "Chokepoints" is indeed the key word here, with
banks and remailer operators as chokees. If you are a government strategist, you might think, Why not make people
strictly liable for, e.g., any crimes planned with their remailers?  And
make ISPs strictly liable for crimes panned or executed on their systems? Those things stand more chance of being upheld than a ban on domestic use
of strong crypto, whether foreign or domestic coded.  I won't go so far as
to say "would be upheld" but it's much easier for me to imagine than a ban
on importing or using strong crypto.  I'm going to expand on this in the
next draft of my "oceans" paper; the draft currently on the web page does
not really do these issues much justice. OK, Tim, what am I missing?  How will Enhanced-crypto-Netscape match remailers for their ability to keep TLAs up at night?

It's important to distinguish between what IS the law and what COULD BE the law.  And to recall that I at least am not talking here about what SHOULD be the law.
It's called "strict liability" -- you are liable when you didn't know.  The economic justification is that you were in the best position to avoid the harm (either by doing some checking, or, in this case (they, not I, would say) not offering the service at all.
they are not now, but why couldn't they?  E.g. tell courriers that they have a duty not to carry drugs, and must pass all packages by drug sniffing dogs?  I don't think that's a good rule, but it's probably They are not.
It wasn't but that's because we don't have that rule.  the question is *could* they be?

@_subject: UK Crypto regs? 
Thank you to AB for forwarding the Ross Anderson summary.
I am unclear on what I consider a key point regarding UK policy.
The US (and Japanese) governments have pledged not to seek to esrow
digital signature keys.  (FWIW I think this is a very important and
praiseworthy pledge.)  There is a large class of DS keys, eg RSA keys,
which can also be used for encryption; there is also a class of keys (eg.
SHA 1, I think?) that cannot.  A PKI that requires escrow therefore must
a) limit the type of encryption allowed for DS keys, end exclude one of
the most popular flavors
or b) escrow digital signature keys
I am unclear as to whether the UK authorities understand this, and if so
which option they plan to choose.  I would welcome any information that
might be floating around.

I don't think this is definitional.  If nothing else they can take the equipment.  If you don't incorporate, your personal assets are at risk; if you do, you have to keep a real separation between the corporation and yourself, pay the taxes, etc.  Ok, make it a non-profit labor of love; low risks, no returns, then maybe you are right.

I agree that absent a statute all that is involved is contract law.
NO IT DOES NOT.  Basic rule of thumb: your lawyer can't be used to hide papers someone else can't hide.  Ok, at the margin it gets tricky, but bascially the privilege is not going to stretch to your key.

I see no reason whatsoever to believe that an un-warranted wiretap would be legal in any but two cases.  (1) Emergency threatening life (e.g. hostage-taking) pending judicial authorizaiton -- very rare.
(2) The president claims residual authority to wiretap on national security grounds without a court order.  Since the FISA court provides the authority, this (one is told) is not used.
There is no question that the Justice dept is very cagey about not ever admitting that one has an exhausive list of means by which they claim the authority to tap.  If some other tap is in use, however, it is an awfully well-kept secret, which argues that it is used for inltellignece and not law enforcement.  LEOs can't keep that kind of secret any more.

Yes and no...and kinda no.
Yes: your employer can require as conditions of employment many many things that the government could never require, e.g. the many examples Tim gives.
No: The constitution prohibits slavery.  This is in fact the *ONLY* part of the constitution that *directly* regulates private behavior (everything else either empowers or disempowers the goverment).  Hency your employer cannot enslave you constitionally.
And "sorta no":  The constitution empowers congress to legislate in many areas.  Congress has legislated many "civil rights" that do not arise directly from the Constitution, but rather from Congress's use of the powers delegated to it under that document.  Thus, an unsuspecting reader might be mislead when TCM serves up the bait by writing...
The issue here isn't a constitutional issue.  It's a *statutory* right. And a real one.  Sex discrimination in employment is prohibited by law. We can call this a "civil right" or something else, but the if the facts
alleged in the case to which TCM refers are as claimed, they seem to have
a fairly good case under the law as it stands.  And there's a lot more
than skimpy outfits at issue, including a refusal to hire men for what are
allegedly food service jobs (gender may only be a determination of
employment if it is a bona fide occupational qualfiication, e.g.  policing
the showers in the gym; gender is not a BFOQ for food service jobs.)

I have no idea how you got this idea.  It is not so.  It sounds like a highly garbled version of the rule for the appeal from a **jury verdict**.  In such cases you can only appeal the result absent a claim of procedural or substantive legal error  if it is so obviously and horribly wrong that no rational jury could possibly have come to that conclusion on the evidence.  In a jury trial therefore the usual method of appeal is to find either an error in the procedure or an error of law in the jury instruction, or in the rare case to challenge the law itself as None of this, however, applies to the CDA case, which is a direct challenge to the Constitutional validity of the law, and which is being tried before a special three-judge panel of the district court, sitting without a jury, pursuant to the special procedure set out in the bill itself.  This procedure is used with some regularity for caseds where congress realizes that the validity of the law is likely to be questioned.
You can appeal directly on the merits.  And you do so.  The higher court decides all questions of law de novo (ie pays no deference ot tyhe decision of the court below beyond whatever persuasive power it may have), but must accept the factual record as presented ("found") by the court below.  Thus the importance of the trial testimony at this stage.

If the legal issue was presented for decision below, and forms a part of
the notice of appeal, then it is properly preented to the court of appeal,
regardless of what the court below actually did.  Any other rule would
allow a trial court to prevent issues from being reviewed.  The Supreme
Court has been known, however, to decide issues that went beyond the
strict confines of these limits. Even things that weren't argued by the parties....  If the appellate decision requires more facts in order to apply the legal principle decided by the higher court, it has the option of remanding the case to the trial court for more fact-finding in light of the legal rules explicated by the higher court.

If they lose they are almost certain to appeal both cases.  If they don't appeal a loss, it means that plaintiffs won, i.e. get what they asked for.  The government isn't going to sit still for that while another case is proceeding.  No problem with two sides each appealing different verdicts to the supreme court.  That's what it's for - to sort things out and make the circuits consistent.
Sorry, I don't recall the language well enough and I'm on the road.  I thought it went to the Supremes no mater what; that's the usual practice, but i could be wrong.   there is a procedure for by-passing the Court of Appeal in urgent cases.  Also, if one case is on a slow track and the other one is on a fast track, there are procedures for getting involved, at least as amici, in the fast track case.

Oversimplified (this is why people *pay* lawyers...).  First, the

varies from state to state.  Variations increase when one considers non-US
Second, to take NY state as an example, a mailing list is almost certainly
NOT a "publisher" but a mere "distributor" and thus held to a MUCH lower
standard of care regarding responsibility for libel.  The "distributor",
like the book store owner, is not presumed to be on notice of the content
of the material, and must take action only if she is made specifically
aware of the libelous nature of the specific content.

federal agency, but that (private) federal reserve banks have five of the
twelve votes (the rest belong to government officials) on the Open Market
Committee, an important policy-setting body that has an influence over the
money supply.  Incidentally, this practice was upheld in Melcher v.
Federal Open Mkt. Comm., 644 F. Supp. 510 (D.D.C. 1986). My article discusses the tangled legality of letting private parties
exercise goverment powers -- a practice that, like it or not, is as old as
the Republic.  (Documentation for that claim appears at   )
and thus about as clearly within the original intent as anything gets.
Incidentally, the practice of giving private parties partial or full
control over seemingly public functions affects a very large number
of bodies, not just the Open Market Committee.

The above is a true statement.  Note however that "congress" cannot
operate the mint.  It must -- **MUST** -- delegate this duty to the
executive branch (or someone outside the legislative branch, cf. Chadha
v. U.S.) if it wants it done. Congress is free to select the type
of agent it wants to do this.  Indeed, if Congress chose to license
private mints, that would, IMHO be legal.  The point here is that the
states don't have the power to coin money.
The above is so oversimplified as to be meaningless; anyway it's almost
certainly (mostly) wrong. It refers to a case that has never been followed
since.  There are many cases since that supply the necessary context.  I
discuss some of them in my article.  I discuss others in my student note
and in other articles availble from my homepage.
Bah. "Mere legallity" indeed. No.  Unless by "effectively" you mean "during periods of inflation".  But
the currency can deflate too... e.g. in a depression. No, I'm afraid you are making the common but incorrect assumption that
reading some part of one court case from the dustbin of history out of
context makes you a constitutional expert. You may feel differently as I get grumpier...

Amazingly, the whole original Bavarian Illuminati panic was set off in
1798 in a single sermon given by Reverend Jedeidiah Morse on May 9, 1798,
based on his reading of John Robison's 1797 book, Proofs of a Conspiracy
Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe.
It's really an incredible piece of US social history and I think tells us

@_subject: Taxation Thought Experiment 
I think there's some funny accounting here...
On Tue, 12 Nov 1996, Joseph M. Reagle Jr., for whom I have considerable
respect and who ordinarily posts very sensible things but appears to have
lent his account to someone else appeared to have written: I will assume you measure productivity by "sales". Note also that it's debatable whether this $100 of sales is exactly "your" productivity.  In some sense it's really the company's, ie a joint product
of your labor, their capital, and the labor of other people in the
production/sales chain: If you could do it alone, you would, so as to
capture the full benefit yourself.  That is why economists sometimes
measure labor productivity by "salary" on the theory that the market
accurately measures what your output is worth.  Note also that the analysis that follows is not really affected by whether
you meant "sales"  or "my contribution to the sale". No.  Company is NOT taxed on gross sales. Corporate income tax does not
work like sales tax.  With some minor exceptions relating to pass-through
rules, foreign sales, and some complex timing issues, corporate tax is
ordinarily levied on NET PROFITS.  Thus, the company first deducts all the
"costs" it can identify, even if those were not necessarily involved in
producing that (or any) sales.  E.g.  advertising, your salary, corporate
junkets, rent, etc.  And lets not forget corporate tax sheltering too... Again, no.  Shareholders come AFTER payroll and costs.
See above.
I'm afraid you are conflating the MARGINAL rate (and when you consider
federal, state and local taxes varies by state) with the AVERAGE rate.
Here in FL. for example there is no state or local income tax.  With tax
sheltering, mortgage deductions etc. no one pays 40% -- the middle class
pay a lower average rate, the upper class pay a much lower average rate.
By now we are into science fiction.
Totally skewed, sorry.  I don't know what the real numbers are, but the
government gets *much* less than this.  I'm sure the aggregate numbers can
be found in the statistical abstract of the U.S. or the council of
economic advisors' annual report to the president, neither of which
happens to be in my office right now.

There are two ways to do this.
Method number one is to have the person present 100 messages for blind
signature.  You unblind 99, check that the data is there; the odds are
good it's there in other one.  If any of the 99 are duds, you kick the
cheater out of the system.
The disadvantage of course is that the blind signer gets to read the
message.  (Actually the other 99 copies of it, but no secrecy for the
signer.)  This wasn't a problem for digital cash where each "message" was
a unique digital coin, but is a problem here.
Brands has a better scheme that I don't understand exactly.  He recently
attempted to explain it to me thusly:
==start quote
In fact, the original Chaum/Fiat/Naor protocol was cut-and-choose,
where you would basically do the work for 100 coins in order to
obtain a single one that contains your identity; in my protocol
the bank sends to the user a single number, the user responds with
a single challenge, and the bank then provides a single response--
from this the user can compute exactly one blinded coin, that
nevertheless contains an identifier no matter how the user performs
the blinding. As a result, the protocol, while complex as to why
it is secure and in particular why the identifier cannot be gotten
rid of, is highly efficient. (To withdraw a coin, both the bank and
the user need not do more real-time computations than the work
for a single modular *multi*plication (not exponentiation)).

@_subject: A word on "emergencies" [WAS Re: Final Solution to the Crypto ] 
I would like to dampen a little of the panic and FUD that seems to be
breeding on the question of the "national emergency" declared to keep the
bulk of the Export Administration Act regulations in effect after the
statute itself lapsed by its own terms.  [Note, by the way, that the EAA
rules are the *mild* ones.  The *tough* ones are still in force and are
not going away ... kill the EAA rules, and they start reclassifying
everything back to the Military List?]
Whether you like it or not, Congress has delegated to the President
sweeping authority to declare "national emergencies" due to foreign
threats.  In wartime the authority is very extensive; in peacetime almost
as great.  The authority is found in the "International Economic Emergency
Powers Act" (IEEPA).  While the President's determination that an
"emergency" exists is not reviewable, actions taken under IEEPA authority
*are* reviewable, indeed more reviewable than acts taken under the export
control laws. Of course since the delegation of power is broad, it's often
hard to win.
There have been LOTS of Presidential declaration of "emergencies" under
IEEPA and its predecessor statutes (e.g.the "trading with the enemy act",
which still applies in wartime).  Indeed, there are fewer today than
before Congress attempted to reform the system and required most of the
large number of emergencies in force to cease.  For example, every time
the President orders an embargo, e.g. against Iran, the statute requires
that he first declare an "emergency".
My point is not that Congress was wise to give the President this power. That's debatable; it's even more debatable that the intent was for it to
be quite as broad as the courts have found it to be (see e.g. Harold Koh's
book, The National Security Constitution, for more info). And, the point is not that Presidents are using this power in a wise or
measured way.  It's obvious that they are not.   At any given time
since WWI, many many (too many) "national emergencies" have been in force.
And, the point is especially not that this President was wise to declare
an emergency on these facts (although in his defense, several previous
presidents did exactly the same thing when previous editions of the EAA
lapsed; it seems to be something of a tradition...). Rather, my point is a simple one.  The fact that the President has
declared an emergency here is primarily a technical legal event.  It is
not a sign that martial law is about to be declared, that they are coming
to take you or your [fill in blank] away, or that anything fundamental has
changed.  Multi-year emergencies in which the executive uses one statute
to compensate for the Congressional decision/failure to pass another
statute is not, I submit, a particularly telling sign of a mature and
healthy democracy.  But this goes to large and gradual processes, not to
anything that suddenly happened. Again, for some background on all this, written before the Nov. 15

After this start, how could I be churlish enough to quibble with anything

We need to be careful here.  Which is the unconstitutional abuse?
a) The Act giving the President emergency powers (IEEPA)
b) The President's use of the act (in this case or in other cases)
c) The courts' decision that the existence of an emergency (as opposed to
the way the powers are used) is not reviewable (more or less on political
question grounds).
d) all of the above.
If I had to pick, my first choice is probably b, then c, then a.  I have
some sympathy for the willingness of courts to duck national security
issues, although not enough sympathy to encompass the amount of ducking we
Again, what's the circumvention?  The administration, let us assume
honestly, believes that the spread of strong reliable crypto abroad is a
big threat;  if it happens it cannot be undone. They think it ("reliable") hasn't happened yet.  I'm inclined to think they're right about the facts
(see e.g. the thread on c'punx or coderpunx about lousy DES
implementations), so far. Is it "unconstitutional" to call this an emergency?  Judgment call.  I
think it's an abuse, but it is (1) routinized (EEA lapses have been dealt
with this way before and NO ONE COMPLAINED, not Congress, not the press,
not the courts, not the exporters, not the public); the administration
could reasonably think this was not a controversial thing to do; (2)

I also bet that if Congress did get sensitized to this issue ... they'd
respond by reactivating the EAA.  I don't get the feeling there is a
groundswell in Congress for abandoning export control (recall that the EAA
controls all dual use munitions -- including missile guidance systems).
This is why the courts are all too likely to allow it.  No one in
government wants to allow weapons parts to be freely exported.

@_subject: The Right to Keep and Bear Crypto 
This will be my last post on this thread.
Why is it "disturbing" that for administrative convenience a regulation
uses a shorthand term (in effect saying "treat crypto as if it was a
munition"), but that the courts say whatever convenient shorthand you use
for regulatory bookkeeping, it has no constitutional effect?
What would be the advantage of having the government simply re-impose the
ITAR word for word identically for all materials that are not arms in the
constitutional sense?  The ultimate result would be the same (since this is
arguably allowed by the statute, and the non-arms have *even less*
constitutional protection (unless they are speech).
This is a different issue; it is irrelevant to the matter at hand since
crypto is not arms under ANY reading of the second amendment. As for your argument that the 2nd Am should be read expansively, rather
than narrowly, personally I doubt strongly that the Framers would have
been unanimous on this.  Recall that the Articles of Confederation were
abandoned in part due to Shay's rebellion -- and the (majority) Federalists (of whom the Jefferson you quote WAS NOT a part)  managed to
push through a strong centralizing government.  Recall that the
constitution in its first draft didn't even have a bill of rights!  I am
absolutely certain that the Framers recognized that things change over
time, and that they would have intended indeed did intend for us to
interpret the constitution with some degree -- but not too much --
flexibility.  As someone who believes in the importance of fidelity to
legal texts, I think we have a duty to make every word in the Constitution
count.  I therefore place weight on the fact that the 2nd amendment is
*unique* in giving the policy reason for the limitation on government
power ("a well-regulated militia" being essential &tc.).  This is ample
grounds to read the text as applying only in the context of an organized
militia -- not casual gun ownership -- **whether or not** this complies
with our best (and inevitably fallible) reconstruction of what certain
historical individuals may have thought the text meant, especially if the
historical evidence is mixed. [PS. Why do you privilege the authors of the
bill of rights over the people who voted for it?]
I might add that I personally find all discussions of plots to kill
people, or to watch gleefully while others seek to do so, so morally
repulsive that I now killfile everyone who takes part in them.  (This has
the interesting side-benefit of cutting the list down to very manageable
size.) This may explain why I do not respond to certain kinds of messages.
I should also add for the benefit of certain third parties to this debate
that I stopped responding to gun control flames three years ago after the
email flood attack by rabid pro-gun people that temporarily crashed my

---------- Forwarded message ----------
    Mike Godwin Esther had written:
This is surely a reasonable statement for Esther to have made, even though
connotatively it may seem to have an anti-anonymity thrust to it. Who can
dispute that individual freedom (of any sort) entails the potential that
someone will use that freedom badly, and that the greater the freedom the
greater the theoretical potential for harm?
The civil-libertarian argument can't be any naive denial of this sort of
analysis -- instead, it has to something that acknowledges the truth of the
principle, yet simultaneously denies the inference that the principle,
standing alone, amounts to a case for limiting that freedom. One way to do
so is to argue  that the theoretical threat is outweighed by the benefits
both to society and to individuals. Another is to point out that there
seems to be no evidence that the theoretical problem has transmuted itself
into a real one.
You may feel free to forward this.

The above is the historical and logical error.  In fact, as you will see
if you read Gordon Woods' magisterial account of the legal and political
history of the constitution, the dominant view (articulated in the
Federalist papers, for example) was the "dual sovereignty" thesis.  In
this view BOTH the federal government AND the states were agents of the
PEOPLE, who were the only sovereign.  This is why the federal constitution
was ratified by popular votes, not by state legislatures -- the
legislatures were not vested with the power to create the union, as this
power was outside the delegation to the states.  Naturally, rebel
Jefferson Davis glossed over all this, if he even understood it, since it
was fatal to his cause. It is consistent with the dual sovereignty thesis to say that "what is
delegated can be withdrawn" but the entity doing the "withdrawing" is the
people (by some democratic process, presumably, e.g. a new constitutional convention), not the states, for it is the people who did the delegation

I agree with two of Tim's points.  I express no opinion about the others,
except that I think these are the two most important. (1) I agree with Tim that as a matter of principle, it would be preferable
to create a new moderated list, with a similar but distinguishable name,
and leave the existing list as it was.  I happen to think less turns on
this than does Tim, given the opportunity to exercise truth-in-labeling,
but it seems to me that because the cost of this approach is zero, and it
has real benefits in the eyes of some, it's a no-brainer.  I expect that I
would subscribe to the filtered version.  If someone is really worried
that the new list will be too low traffic (please, G*d), they can send an
automatic ballot to all subscribers, USENET style,asking what list(s) they
want to be on.  My own view is that if you are not ready, willing or able
to read and follow a periodic posting explaining how to sign on/off
various lists (and I assume there should and would be one), I am willing
to take the risk of missing your input.
(2) Much to my surprise, so far moderation is a failure.  I think it is a
failure because it achieves neither of the moderation "sweet spots".  No
moderation is one "sweet spot".  Strict moderation -- the kind you get on
RISKS, where you know nearly every post is on-topic or at least worth your
time -- is another. This is neither. My clumsy procmail filters are almost
as busy as ever.  What slips through is largely duplicative of what I get
from other lists, or is not to my taste. (NB *my taste*.)  And it gets
here slower.  It's true that the venom from anonymous remailers is gone,
and that is a plus, but even so little of what slips through is of
interest modulo other lists.  I happen to think that *stricter* moderation
might lure back some of the better content-providers, but it would help to
set it up in a manner that offends the smallest possible number.
As Oscar Wilde either said, or should have said, the worst crime is to be

This would be the same Strassmann who stated in public at Harvard early in
1995 that most remailers were run by intelligence agencies such as the
KGB, then denied saying it when asked for substantiation?   And cut it
from his paper?
Having said that, there is some debate about the extent to which in
*intelligence gathering* as opposed to, say, trying to crack a banking
protocol, one can reasonably count on a known plaintext.  And much debate
about the processing costs of not having one, especially when one doesn't
know what kind of document is being encrypted (e.g. is it ASCII plaintext?
a spreadsheet? a jpeg? etc.).  I think that's his (misdirected) point.

1) I stopped learning more about new computer tools than the minimum

2) Our system here has ONE email system: PINE.  It defaults my "from"

necessary tools and permissions, I may not; I don't feel like taking
whatever time it takes to figure it out.  We use PINE for usenet and
email, using the same config file.  There are other usenet tools here,
like tin, but I would have to learn them.  Again, I have no idea if I have
the permissions/tools/knowledge to alter my headers.  I am certain that I
could hack it with time enough and motivation enough.  I have neither.
3) I do other things besides talk to you with this tool.  I communicate
with students, family and others.  I want them to get my real headers.  I
don't want an elaborate switching mechanims every time I change the person
I'm speaking to.

@_subject: Sandy and I will run a cypherpunks "moderation" experiment  in Jan 
I'm not sure I see why a moderator would have any liability for passing on
a trade secret or even a classified military secret so long as the
moderator did not have a contractual relationship (or a clearance, as the
case may be) with the owner.  That's free speech.  The moderator might
have to cooperate with a subpoena from the original owner seeking to find
who stole/released the secret, but that's a different problem.  Is there
some trade secret theory of an implicit trusteeship that i don't know
about? On the more general subject of moderator liability, I vaguely recall that
the CDA had some badly-drafted language that was designed to reduce
moderator liability, but that it was so badly worded as to be ambiguous.
I'm just back from a months' trip and sorting through stuff so i don't
have time to look it up.  Anyone got it handy?
PS  I support moderation, at least as an experiment.  As to the choice of the moderator, innocent until proven guilty, I say. I personally don't put much store in requiring a moderator to issue a code
of practice.  Common law and equity will do to evolve a system as it goes
I prefer a system where the rejected posts are in a segregated list so
that they are easy to find.  Not everyone has great tools for merging two
lists to find the differences. Of course, the moderator liability issue is
at its greatest is the moderator creates a "trash" list, also know as a
"sue me" list. I do see how the legal position would be better if you have
an unmoderated list and a separate "best-of" list that is moderated.
Finally,  how about a THIRD list to discuss moderation issues so that it
doesn't clutter up the "best-of" list?  A. Michael Froomkin        | +1 (305) 284-4285; +1 (305) 284-6506 (fax)

a reliable friend wrote to me to say ...
The Uniform Trade Secrets Act (which has been adopted by a
majority of jurisdiction) provides for liability of a third party who
knows or has reason to know that information he recieves or discloses
was acquired by improper means or under circumstances giving rise to
a fiduciary duty OR that he knows to be proprietary but which he
recieved by accident or mistake.  Depending on the facts, the
language could encompass a moderator who knew about or turned a blind
eye to distribution of trade secrets on his list.

I think it tells us that Verisign managed to convince the government that
their product is only used for authentication, not encrypting content. Which appears currently to be true, no?  And since AFIK (Please, someone,
correct this if I'm wrong!) you can't with netscape anyway download
another party's key that you verify with a Verisign certificate, it would
take a fair amount of work for the ordinary user to set up a secure
channel using the current Verisign infrastructure.   The ITAR exception for authentication-only products is of long standing.

Lest anyone be mislead, this filing is garbage.  I find particularly
ridiculous the idea that a court can only cite cases submitted by the
parties.  On the contrary, the court's duty is to cite the law correctly,
and thus to ignore anything inaccurate or irrelevant submitted by the
parties and to supplement where and when needed.  Nowhere is this duty
clearer when, as here, one side is not represented by counsel; as it
happens, the court exercises this duty to supplement _to help_ the pro se
plaintiff, not hurt it.
I have not followed the pleadings very carefully in this case, so I won't express a view on the merits except to say that having attempted to read
plaintiffs' submissions I was not able to figure out much about what merit
their case was supposed to have.  Were I to be asked by a pro se plaintiff how to best present their case in
federal court, I would say:  don't try to write legalistically.  Use the
case caption at the top of the first page, as provided by the rules of
court, then identify who you are, and who you are suing in the first
paragraphs, then tell your story in plain and simple English with as few
legalisms as possible.  If you have a particular statute or statutes in
mind that you think were violated, do specify them, but also ask for
whatever other relief the court may find just or equitable so as to
preserve all your options. Legalistic mumbo-jumbo is NOT required, and only gets in the way of
telling your story.  Attacking the court is stupid, both because it
usually isn't justified and because it never achieves anything.
