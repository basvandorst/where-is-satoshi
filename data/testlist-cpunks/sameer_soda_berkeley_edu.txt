bunch of net-fiends like ourselves can live together.
connect it to out home network of computers. I'd like to see a
terminal in the kitchen, the bathroom, a few in the living room, and
personal privately owned machines in each individual's bedroom. All
this hardware will be wired together into a local network, which is
then connected to the internet, via a dedicated line of some sort.
providing internet services to the local community to bring in income.
Minimally, the net-link should be paid for by our income. Ideally,
we'll have enough income to pay the rent.
compete with the giants, netcom, crl, etc. We will provide a service
along with the shell accounts that won't be found at the giants-- a
community-oriented personalized approach. We want to build a community
around this thing. We'll have a local BBS, monthly meetings, internet
tutorials, and maybe even parties, where the attendants can take a
break from dancing and log into vrave.
writers, artists, teachers, techies.. If you have a talent, it's
likely that the NEXUS could put it to good use. We need teachers to
run the tutorials. Artists to make flyers and decorate the place.
Writers to write press releases and other written work. Sociologists
to study us and keep us from killing each other.
2) Technical issues
 A) The link

regard. We can go with The Little Garden, a cooperative, whom Sameer
would very much like to deal with, because of the cooperative nature
of it all.

is an inevitable situation. We will probably end up with an overbooked
T1 [The Little Garden] and move up from there (time and money will
tell) The provider is also quite up in the air. We can't be positive
who we will want to deal with.  Demand exceeds supply, so finding a
provider who is civil and non-anal retentive about usage could be a
chore. (Sprintlink seems like a good option.)
 B) The computers and hardware
CPU-power we need) which is owned by the group, some terminals, (bad
ones for the kitchen & bathroom, but good ones for the living room) a
router, and a CSU/DSU pair. Individual resident members should use
privately-owned computers for their rooms.
filesystem with most stuff, email, news, general files, but each
individual's private computer is very isolated and paranoid about
security, where they can store sensitive things such as PGP private
keys. CFS can also be installed on the personal workstations, so that
private computers need not have that much local drive space, while
preserving privacy.
have pretty much ruled out intel processors at this point. Sun and DEC
seem to hold the most promise for servers.  We have to learn a lot
more about machines before deciding what will suit our needs. We can
get something used.

 C) Machine Speed/Upgrades

to the task is going to be a royal pain. Each upgrade brings new
problems and exposes new bottlenecks.
waiting 30 sec to a min for their mail or news to index or for a
program to start. This gets people complaining fast.
slower machines here, but we will need power news and mail get backed
up at another site and we get hit with a deluge all in one day (this
happens more than you may think)
maybe a one dollar per meg per month charge for diskspace used over
five megs.  We need need to know this before we know how much HD space
to buy.
 D) Dialups staff for (eskimo.com) has a basic policy of 90% free. Meaning 90% of
the time you get through on the first try. This has worked out to 13
users per dialup. We will likely find something similar. Optimally I

and uses our machines to communicate with other users in the same
general area or around the world I know DOOM can be played on
networks.  It would be interesting to talk with id software and see
what we can hack together.
3) Social issues
 A) Residents
have to be pretty compatible in living style, as well. It seems that
5-10 would work out pretty well, with seven as the ideal.  We also
need *balance*. We need techs, artists, writers, teachers, and more
sorts to round out the local community. A household full of
tech/hacker/geek-types won't be well-rounded enough for my tastes.
(Well all be net-fiends, though, of course.)
of time and money to the nexus. Time and a desire to work are
*clearly* more important than the size of your monetary
contribution. We will however need a decent amount of capital to get
the ball rolling. All types of people need apply. We have enough
people to run the tech end of things even now (though we would like a
few more).
 	  We intend to try living together for a month or 3 to iron
out the kinks before sinking our hard won cash into a ton of
equipment. There are a ton of horrible nasty issues that have to be
worked out before we can even THINK of doing this seriously.
 B) Local community
help foster the community-oriented aspects. Sameer thinks that the
local discussions groups should be accesible ONLY via the BBS
(hopefully we can find a good free BBS system for UNIX) because
there's an entirely different feeling when accessing something via a
usenet newsreader than a BBS interface.
directly to a shell that is cool too) as the default. Something that
is intuitive and user friendly. Something that encourages
communication between our customers. Encourages them to make their own
spaces within the BBS (various conferences or groups-- it should be
trivial for a user to start his or her own local group). We should
encourage people use the machines for thier projects and interests --
hopefully things we haven't even conceived.
  It is important to get the users as involved in the bbs as
possible. Aron has noticed that people will put up with a lot of crap
if you tell them *why* it is happening and *what* is being done to fix
it. Encourge folks to build a place where they will feel comfortable.
only thing we will be able to offer folks that crl and netcom
can't. Although I do not want to do this at the expense of
performance, community is something that we can only work to foster;
if we pull it off will not cost us anything in the way of money.
select few that are very much worth playing.  They also do a ton for a
community vibe (at least some of them do) This is another thing that
can start small (depending on resources) and grow to hugeness.
  C) Nexus Fissioning
parties with the recources to do so "glomming on". Most of this can be
addressed at a later date.
  D) Meetings
face to face and show them that we are in fact real folks. It makes
people feel better about the service and enhances the community
vibe. Aron would suggest monthly meetings. Sunday afternoons are
usually the best time. A place like a pizza joint usually has no
problem with this since they get little buisness on sunday
afternoons. Also that is the time most people will be able to make a
meeting. Before Aron left Seattle eskimo was getting between 20-30
folks a month sometimes as many as 50. He's sure it has swelled since
eskimo's subscriber base has exploded.
4) Economic issues
 A) Incorporation
stuff, but the question is whether or not we should incorporate as a
about organising as a buisness is to organise as a corperation. This
protects us from being sued as individuals and has tons of other nice
benefits-- limited liability. There are also numerous reasons we would
like a corporation for tax reasons, because by moving personal
expenses to corporate expenses we can get bigger tax writeoffs.
 B) Incomes for residents
 C) Self-sufficiency
dealing with new arrivals/departures will get VERY interesting.
 D) Shell accounts for the community
big providers will be the niche market I've been talking about. The
community-oriented approach will give us our market. I'd like it to be
sorta like the well but less expensive, and less elitist. Monthly
meetings for users, occasional parties, and the like will build a
strong commitment between the nexus and the dialup members.
  F) Anonymous crypto services
5) Projects
communities. They will also be a major source of income (depending on
the nature of the project obviously). Hopefully, they will also be a
hell of a lot of fun. We need any and all ideas for more project
themselves how they can contribute using their own particular skills,
in their own project. Thus before anyone joins the NEXUS-Berkeley an
individual should write up an informal "Project Proposal" such that
their commitment is made firm and we know how they'll be able to help.
among various newsgroups, so that interested people may join us if
they so desire.
  A) Programming
that will be the focal point and that which brings us together, a
facilitator if you will) we will most likely have tons of programming
projects going. Some of which will relate directly to the BBS, others
which may have uses to a variety of people. Writing free software for
net distribution and the like. The majority of the things below are
just ideas I am throwing at you. Feel free to pick them up and run or
add your own.
  B) AI
various things in this area.
  C) Graphics
can turn it into money though I *know* there are many ways. We could
possibly offer the basic scanning and manipulation services in order
to help pay for the workstations and other assorted equipment.
  D) Cryptography
cryptographic and anonymity tools through the Nexus for fun &
profit. There is a good deal that we can do, including pay for use
anonymous remailing services, anonymous IP forwarding (IP laundry) TCP
in UDP tunnelling so that nomads can have TCP/IP connectivity
whereever they have a telnet dialup.

development. There is a ton of public domain code to start with and
build on. I would favor a microkernel UNIX variant. We could offer
free accounts to other folks who are willing to do coding (up to a
reasonable level). We could offer a full blown killer OS for the price
of Windows or System 7. Aron fully realizes this is one of his "lofty"
goals, but he would love to see it happen.

quite a bit of shit to consider insurance and crap.
intercity/international collaborative music-making would be an
excellent project. This could be incorporated into collaborative
artwork as well, similar to things such as the OTIS Project.

$20 event we will kill them) We have a few folks who are knowledgeable
about what to do here.
terminals available, either logged into vrave or connected with other
Nexus-homes across the world each of them holding parties at the same
time, so that international parties can be arranged. Sameer has
mentioned this idea to many people and they are very interested-- this
seems a great way of getting people interested in becoming members or
simply attending our parties.  noise in the neigborhood. And numbers of people.  This is a great idea
for community building.
party ideas are great, but do we really want a ton of people we don't
know, knowing that we have 100 grand worth of equipment in our house?
Security is a big issue here, as well as the fact that we may not have
enough room to pull shit like this off. This is definetly something
that needs to be hashed out.
  I) Testers beta test our projects. We can offer incentives to these people as
well (although early use of the program should be enough).
6) The house
 A) Location
the UC, so I'd like to live close by. There's more people in the area,
which is a plus, as well. Choosing a place close to the PacBell's
Berkeley Cental Office would give us improved line quality and a
cheaper leased line.
also a small possibility that the house could be in San
Francisco. There are a variety of factors involved, some of which will
not be resolved for a while.  There is also a more miniscule
possibility that the nexi will fission off before even getting started
with locations in each city. (If we end up with say 20 *seriously*
interested people this would be the most likely scenario.)
 B) Size
7 being considered optimum) When it comes to floors and number of
rooms, that is still up in the air this depends mostly on how people
want to live, some can handle living in rooms with one or 2 other
people while other people *need* thier own space.

all the residents, so that we can host parties while preserving the
security of each individual resident's space.

the connection between anon-ids and real IDs. I still wanted it to be

various levels of security which you can use. Because the remailernet
is not very reliable, the idea is that you setup a number of paths
which mail can get to you through, so that if one path goes down you
can still use the other paths to get mail. You can either configure it
so that mail to you goes through every path (for reliability with less
security) or one path chosen at random (more secure but less

good deal of reliability, but you get absolutely no good security. The
"path information" is what gets tacked onto the top of the body before
the message gets sent to the first hop. Suppose your firsthop was

a keypair, distribute to everyone on the mailing list the secret key,

course means that anyone can subscribe or unsubscribe (Removing paths

Removing paths
ineffective, you need some way of turning that path off so you're not
paying for it in spray mode, and so you don't lose mail in random
mode. That's what the disablepath command is for. To run the
disablepath command you simply send the command (signed, as always) to

::disablepath pathnumber

records of your active and disabled paths.

just send:
::recoverpath firsthop pathnum

Path Verification
given path flakes out on you. For this reaon the "regping" option is
available. This command lets you tell the system how often you want
the anon-server to send a message through every path of yours, with
the pathnumber in the message (encrypted, of course) so that you can
keep tabs on which paths are flaking out on you.

for the Magic Money server which allows the server to sit on a port
and wait for connections. When a connection comes in it forks and
processes the request, by just taking the input, passing it to the 's'
server released by Pr0duct Cypher, and then returning the server's

from any directory, but it looks in ~/.bank for the bank.asc,
rand.dat, and other files that the program uses.

it greatly.
To invoke the server:
Edit server.pl and give it the port number you want.
Run 'server.pl' in the directory which has the 's' program and the files that
the 's' program uses. server.pl will fork and wait on the port specified.
To run the client:
Create the ~/.bank directory, and put rand.dat and bank.asc in that
Edit the client.pl to reflect the port number and the hostname of the
server, as well as the location of Pr0duct Cypher's 'c' binary.

accounts and services will be available for half-price if the other
half is paid in NexusBucks (not yet available). (Eventually I'd like
to move to a full-payment in NexusBucks, but I want to verify that I
can meet my bottom line .. PacBell and The Little Garden don't take
payment in NexusBucks.)
LETS? Thanks.

you've done with Magic Money so far.
automatic. People have wondered why no one is using their magic money
bank-- it's because it is *SLOW* and a *pain in the ass* to use!
(That's why I'm not using 'em at least.) You have to mail a request
in, and then wait for a reply, and then run it through the client
To remedy this problem, I have written code.
on any internet port waiting for messages. I have written a client
which is not as functional as the one you have described below, but it
automates all communication with the server. When you have incoming
money, you just run the client on the incoming money, and the client
communicates with the server, the client takes the output of the
server, and processes it, all with *1* user command. That's
version to the list. I'll make it available on the soda-ftp site.
