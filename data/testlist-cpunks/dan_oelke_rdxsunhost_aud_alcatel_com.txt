I am not an expert in the *exact* physics of quantum crypto or of optical amplifiers, but I do have a least a college "modern physics"
level of understanding of both.  (and write software for a lot of
fiber optics hardware)
Quantum Crypto depends on the fact that you can't observe
the photons without disturbing them, and that this disturbance
would be detectable at the receiver.  (i.e. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle at work)
Optical Amplifiers work by receiving a relatively small number of photons, and passing them through a device where each photon creates in effect a cascade of photons
to be generated thereby amplifying the signal.
Now, this cascade mechanism in itself might be enough "measurement"
to cause problems - but I don't know - and won't persue this
avenue further.
The problem is that while the waveform will be propagated, the
orignal photons won't necessarily make it from one end to the
other.  Without these original photons making the entire journey I don't see how the quantum crypto would work.
There are also pratical limitations on the number of optical
amplifiers you can have in a system before having an
electrical regenerator.  Typical numbers are around 5 amplifiers, eaching going about 80km.  This doesn't allow for around the world pure glass communications. ;-(
