Please cancel my subscription to cypherpunks mail feed.
Can't keep up with the input and it was really only a passing interest.
Thanks for your time.

@_subject: UNSUBSCRIBING 
I tried previously to get out of the cypherpunks mailing list by sending a request (incorrectly) to cypherpunks at toad.com
Since this was wrong I got fairly toasted by various flames.
Not one of these people who were so concerned about bandwidth etc etc actually told me how to correctly unsubscribe, (I did get a few references to various RFC's and FYI's which I can't find anywhere).
Since then I have sent an UNSUBSCRIBE letter to cypherpunks-request at toad.com several times and without any effect, I'm still getting mail !
Can someone either remove me from this list or explain in plain english how I can get myself removed !???
Sorry to waste bandwidth, (even though the Dethead seems to waste more of your bandwidth than I would in a hundred years).
Sorry if this message is taken as a flame but this IS a high volume message area and I'm being swamped !
