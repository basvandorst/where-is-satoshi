@_subject: <Perry's list> 
As I remember ancient history it was the coderpunks offspin refusing
any politics while "Perry's list" - cryptography - started with the intent of
allowing  crypto-politics and related subjects that the moderator  would
let through. Anyway, "Perrygrams" have become almost extinct on the
cryptographt list lately.

@_subject: New (?) tric(k) for Internet Partitioning 
This Swedish entity believes it has found the solution
(patented) to the long standing problem of effortless
micropayments for web content. The solution is -
skip micropayments! - but let the ISPÂ´s pay tax to
the content providers, the amount calculated from
the size of the ISP's customer base, regardless of
which sites the particular ISP customers actually
visit. So you need a World Association of Approved
Content Providers (WAACP) to share the tax profits.
The tric(k) seems to be a method of technically
denying access to sites in the  WADCP domain
to users who's ISP is not paying the taxes.
One big problem is that providers of Not PC Content
naturally will be barred from the WADCP.
Even if it won't help the MS Masses it would be a
gift if their system were crackable.

@_subject: cell phone anonymity 
1) Buy a cell phone and pay cash
2) Buy a GSM cash-card and pay cash
3) DonÂ´t send in the registration form to get that extra half hour!  :-)
To stall traffic analysis - buy many GSM cash-cards and change
frequently - they are only around USD 10 (not counting the prepaid
calling time). I don't believe the cell phone is sending it's serial
number (but who - except for deep insiders and possibly Lucky Green -
knows for sure?).

That's for sure.
This is a later day example of a so called (in Sweden; French version?)
"Nigeria-letter". This kind of scam started in the 80s (possibly earlier in
a lesser scale) by snail and later by fax - it's probably been around in the
form of "private" email for quite a time. Presumably, because of cultural
and habitual phenomenons, Euorpeans have been prime targets. Really,
legions of fools have been ruined for the purpose of this oblique kind of
"band aid" to Africa. Obviously, some not so smart "Nigerian" has now
found out about old-fashioned capital-letter spamming. I doubt he'll get
anyone on the hook.

I doubt that the story is true. Belgium couldn't be that different
from Sweden. Since SMS-ing is cheap it's a major method of
communicating especially for younger (poorer) persons but
increasingly also for the middle aged. The "Hi, I feel lonely,
everybody seems out to get me, can I stay at your place for a while,
Grettings, Osama"-SMS joke chain letter - with several variants -
have been around here for several weeks and in a very large scale.
I've recieved several and everyone I've asked has got at least one,
usually from a close friend.
The joking community is unintentionally flooding Echelon.

There is a way of keeping informed that is disturbed by HTML (and sometimes by top posting). Firstly, HTML-forums with threads are out of the question because it takes way too much time to find out if something of interest has been posted. You can't rely on thread subjects for that. The old mail-list format is much more reliable if you don't want to miss Also, if you don't want to miss anything, you are probably subscribing to the cypherpunks, cryptography at randombits, cryptography at metzdowd and cryptopolitics (low volume at the moment) lists, often receiving a hundred postings every day, or more. Including doubles and triples reposted by Eugene Leitl. To scan these postings with the quick-browse/delete-method (3-4 posts a second) is significantly, irritatingly slower if you have to wait for the fractions of a second that the HTML needs to load.
