@_subject: Wich pgp is stronger? 
Hi C'punks:
Wich pgp is supposed to be stronger, 2.6.2 or 2.6.2 i?
What are exactly the differences between them?
Thanks, Jaime

@_subject: Question on modular exponents 
Hi CP's:
I'd be pleased if someone explained me this ASAP:
How could I demonstrate that _ (g^a)^b (mod p) = g^{(a*b) mod q} mod p _
when g's order in Zp is q?
The same question remains for adition. I have the feeling the demonstration
must be similar.

@_subject: Question on Galois Fields 
Hi C'Punks.
Here's a rather mathematical question.
Can anyone explain or give an example of how to use arithmetic in GF(q^n)?
Often in cryptography we work in GF(p). I knew the existence of other fields,
like elliptic curves and so, but I found a short comment in Applied
Cryptography page 210 that I couldn't understand.
Thanks in advance for your help.

Maybe some of you already know about this.
Whe reading PGP's "Only for your eyes" messages, the program creates a temporary file containing the plaintext in the directory where the cyphertext file is.
So, don't worry about this option, it's quite useless.
