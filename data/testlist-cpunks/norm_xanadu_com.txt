@_subject: TEMPEST not restricted 
While taxpayers paid for TEMPEST and NACSIM 5100A and it would undoubtedly
be useful to taxpayers were it declassified, it is not true
that compliance with NACSIM 5100A is necessary and sufficient to
be secure from eavesdropping. Some of RSA's charm is that it was not
promulgated by NSA!

@_subject: another service 
I think that there is an even easier time stamping service than that described by Eric Hollander. It too requires a trusted service with a trusted clock. It has just two key pairs, A and B. The protocol is that you send it a message, perhaps with payment under public-A. It returns the message joined with the time provided by its clock under key private-B. The returned message provides evidence in the future that you held the original message at the time indicated in the returned message. This protocol requires no data base of It was once the practice (perhaps still) to mail oneself (US mail) a certified  envelope with information that one might want to prove that he had had at some earlier date. One would then keep but not open the delivered envelope.

@_subject: PGP with license 
This was originally addressed to Phillip Zimmermann.
Thank you for writting PGP. I have not run it on my Mac yet because my version
of Stuffit is 2.0 which deems the PGP.sit file to advanced. I resist
the incentives of compression program authors to produce frequent incompatible
updates which cost money and delay for little apparent advantage.
Compact pro is a shareware program that produces self expanding archives
which presume no pre installed decompressor. It is available by ftp at
You may forward this to whomever does the Mac version
or send me his email address.
What I really am writting you about is to suggest that if you wrote "another"
program compatible with PGP under a PFP license that I would pay at least $50
for it. I might pay more depending on my experience with the free version.
I would accept delivery by email.

@_subject: John Gilmore & NSA 
This Saturday's NewYork Times has a nice article on page 7 regarding NSA's declassification of some of the Friedmann works
under legal pressure from John Gilmore.

@_subject: Communications Policy 
I hear concern over privacy and also over erasure of White House tapes.
I pose the following question: Should an institution have the right
to private communication? Is the White House an institution?
Notice that I say "should" not "does".
Which sort of world would you rather live in. I have mixed feelings.
If we say that all computer communications should be accessible to courts
then the effect will be to displace some communications from computers.
