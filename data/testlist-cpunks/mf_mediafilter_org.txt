Call For Projects:
____________________the black.hole in the net is open.
____________________please go to:
for name.space. networks, go directly to
to add your link (name.space. url's only!).
This project is based on "soft home" or "multi-homing"
on web servers with the use of only one ip number.
any number of names can be mapped to a single ip number.
the server delivers the web page associated with the name
that the server answers to, i.e.
               returns the black.hole page
   returns the black.hole link page
       returns the black.hole link generator page
The black.hole is an example of content-routing possible
with the name.space naming system.
Best regards,

Much Ado About Names
The internet naming system, known as the "domain name system"
has made the transition to the private sphere from the once
taxpayer supported public sphere, under guardianship of the
National Science Foundation.  The current operator of the
name registry, the InterNIC (internet network information center),
is Network Solutions, Inc.who now enjoys a highly profitable monopoly.
Network Solutions, Inc., who is owned by Scientific Applications
International Corporation (SAIC) began charging for the once gratis
name registrations in September 1995 as the internet was well on its
transition to a commercial marketplace.  Their registration fee of
$100 for the first 2 years of service has richly lined NSI's coffers
as the number of registrations reached around 50,000 per month during
1996.  During this interval, the limitations of the current naming
paradigm became obvious as companies discovered that they had to race,
or in some cases litigate, to secure their internet identities,
"their-name.com"--only to discover that it was already assigned.
Some, like golf protege, Tiger Woods, became victims of name
speculators who registered famous names in hopes of selling them
back to their rightful owners.  The holders of "tigerwoods.com"
were said to be willing to give the REAL Tiger Woods his name back
only if they could do his website!
Part of the problem lies not just in human greed, but in the
limited number of the so-called "top level domains" administered
by the InterNIC, "com." "edu." "org." "net." and "gov.".
Under this system, which has its roots in the US Dept. of Defense
bureaucracy, was designed to identify the purpose or geographic
location of computers on the internet.
The "com." domain was the division given to commercial
network addresses, who at the time the system was established, were
a minority of networks on the interet--the majority being "mil."
"gov." "edu." and "net.".  Now that the number of commercial networks
has grown beyond any scale ever imagined by the architects of the internet,
the "com." domain has proven to have reached its limits.
Users have been frustrated by the limitations,
speculation, and buraucracy associated with registering an address on
the internet with the InterNIC/NSI/SAIC monopoly.  Pressure on the
committee that assigns unique parameters on the internet, the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has pushed IANA to for an ad-hoc
committee to decide how to deal with the domain name "shortages".
IANA has put forth a controversial plan to license comapnies who
wish to compete in the market for domain name service--in a market-
place which was recently deregulated, and in which IANA has no
congressional authority to impose regulation, or levy taxes
--or as they frame it, collect license fees: a $1000 non-refundable
application fee, a $2000 annual license fee, plus 2% of comapany
revenues.  IANA claims that these funds will be spent on maintaining
the rootservers--the computers which hold the central name dabase.
The computers holding the domain name database are currently run by
an inner circle, most of whom are members of the IANA. The server at
University of Southern California, USC, for example, is run by
Mr. John Postel, the head of the IANA.
The locations and operators of the current rootservers include:

IANA's plan, which has no congressional mandate,
is imposing regulation on a deregulated market, subsidizing corporations,
and collecting double taxes on US and International companies, as evidenced
by the identities of the networks who would reap the benefits of any
fees imposed on other registries.
To add insult to injury, is to examine the profile of SAIC,
a 2 billion dollar company with strong ties to the Pentagon and the
NSA.  SAIC is an employee-owned company of 20,000 with about 450
offices around the globe.  Its current board of directors include
former National Security Agency chief Bobby Inman, Former Defense
Secretary Melvin Laird, and the former head of research and development
for the Pentagon, Donald Hicks.  Ex-CIA director Robert Gates, Secretary
of Defense William Perry and CIA Director John Deutsch have been past
board members.  Eighty-three percent of SAIC's $2 billion annual
revenue comes from government contracts, including defense, intelligence
and law enforcement contracts.  SAIC is designing new information
systems for the Pentagon, helping to automate the FBI's computerized
fingerprint identification system, and last year won a $200million
contract to provide "information support" to the IRS.
(source: John Dillon, "Networking with Spooks", CAQ magazine, winter, 1996).
Enter the free market.  Individual comapnies cropped up in
response to the command economy of artificial shortages that
had been imposed by a US-centric, militaristic bureaucracy
and created new networks of rootservers outside the "sanctioned"
servers on which all connections on the internet depend.
If your name does not appear in the "sanctioned" database
(the rootservers detailed above), your name will not be found
everywhere on the internet....only other computers who check
the "outsider" database will be able to resolve the new domain
names created by the independent companies.--and there are
already around 200 new possible names under which one can
register on these new services.  This poses a problem for
the independent upstart name registries because, although
they may have a fully functional rootserver system in place,
and a fully automated and operational registration service
in place, they are essentially frozen out of service becuase
the de-facto rootservers, controlled by members of IANA, decide
which entries will be in the database of the "sanctioned" rootservers.
Hence, the IANA has a vested interest in protecting their
control over the "whos-who" list of internet networks, as do
their compatriots at Network Solutions, Inc., SAIC, and the
government agencies who do business with them.

independent name registry, please go to

...Kashpureff didn't expect such a negative reaction.
"When Network Solutions cuts my throat, then I will become
a gurella martyr like Phil Zimmerman (of PGP fame)"
he proclaimed to Wired news....
Give me a break!  this is like some bad tv movie.
Kashpureff, the self-styled martyr in hiding from the feds
as they move in to seize his computers after he hijacked
traffic from Nework Solutions' website to his own
(in a desperate attempt to log some hits?). If this is supposed
to be some profound statement, I think the message is lost
in the idiocy of it all.
As I stated in a previous posting, I denounce this type of traffic hijacking
as irresponsible practice and as a negative reflection on other independents
who are working to open up the address space on the net in the interests
of the public.
If Kashpureff would like to participate in the evolution of the net,
he should not jeopardize its stability of for the sake of personal vanity.
This type of drama and diversion are totally unnecessary, and obscures
the focus on the real issues at hand in the whole namespace debate.
One major factor of the issue is being settled in the name.space/pgMedia
anti trust action against NSI...Kashpureff and others could potentially benefit
from the outcome of that action if they conduct themselves in a mature and
responsible manner.  The next step in the implementation of the expanded
namespace demands responsible practice if we are to avoid government
regulation and corporate beauracracy and let the system evolve and regulate
itself naturally.
Judging by this recent bahavior though, it appears that some can't deal
with it all now, that it's beginning to get too real.
The games and posturing are over.  It's time to finally put up or shut up.
...In my opinion, that is...

@_subject: PGP Media Sues NSI To Open the Domain Name Registration Market 
PRESS RELEASE PGP Media, Inc.
New York, New York March 20, 1997
  PGP Media Sues To Open the
Domain Name Registration Market
PGP Media, Inc., d/b/a   name.space(tm)
(  ("PGP"),
announces  that  it has commenced an action in
Federal Court in New York City against Network
Solutions, Inc. ("NSI"), seeking, among other
things, to open access to the domain name
registration market to allow open, unrestricted
competition for the offering of Domain Name
registration under potentially limitless Shared
Top Level Domains.   PGP believes that the
Internet has long since become a vibrant and
maturing market in which certain de facto
monopolists, operating for profit, have been
allowed to flout the laws of the United States
and other countries which are expressly aimed at
preventing such conduct.  A copy of the
Complaint in that action is now available on
the name.space(tm) web page referred to above.
          With the commencement  of  this  case,
 PGP  is  now accepting registrations of domain
names under an expansive list of Shared TLDs.
An initial registration under a TLD listed on
the name.space(tm) web page may be made  for $10.
When,  as a result of the lawsuit or otherwise,
the names registered become universally
resolvable  and the PGP Name Servers become
"root," an additional charge of $15 will be
imposed to fully register the name for the first
full year of use following such universal
resolvability.   PGP intends to charge a $25
renewal fee for each subsequent year of use of
names registered through its registry.   In
addition, PGP iS also accepting suggestions for
additional Shared TLDs to be added to the PGP
Registry.  The fee which will be charged for
such additional Shared TLDs has not yet been
          For additional information regarding
the lawsuit or to receive regular updates,
please contact mjd at pgpmedia.com.

Crypto AG: The NSA's Trojan Whore?
                    by Wayne Madsen
        FOR AT LEAST HALF A CENTURY, THE US HAS BEEN
         INTERCEPTING AND DECRYPTING THE TOP SECRET
        DOCUMENTS OF MOST OF THE WORLD'S GOVERNMENTS
      It may be the greatest intelligence scam of
      the century: For decades, the US has routinely
      intercepted and deciphered top secret
      encrypted messages of 120 countries. These
      nations had bought the world's most
      sophisticated and supposedly secure
      commercial encryption technology from
      Crypto AG, a Swiss company that staked its
      reputation and the security concerns of its
      clients on its neutrality. The purchasing
      nations, confident that their communications
      were protected, sent messages from their
      capitals to embassies, military missions, trade
      offices, and espionage dens around the world,
      via telex, radio, teletype, and facsimile. They
      not only conducted sensitive albeit legal
      business and diplomacy, but sometimes
      strayed into criminal matters, issuing orders
      to assassinate political leaders, bomb
      commercial buildings, and engage in drug and
      arms smuggling. All the while, because of a
      secret agreement between the National
      Security Agency (NSA) and Crypto AG, they might as
      well have been hand delivering the message to Washington.
      Their Crypto AG machines had been rigged so that when
      customers used them, the random encryption key
      could be automatically and clandestinely
      transmitted with the enciphered message. NSA
      analysts could read the message traffic as easily
      as they could the morning newspaper.
