Or remember the CCC project: They collect US$ 400,000 to build there own

@_subject: Secure HTTP servers. 
Secure HTTP ist the HTTP protocol based on SSL sockets. You may choose any
server you like or which fits your needs (database connections, ...). There
are not so many cryptographic failtures a developer can do. Keep you hands
away from servers only supporting exportable protocols.
Ask you next Certification Authority for help, they must support your server
software. (we do run one ;->)

@_subject: Security flaw in PGPverify of INN 
I was urged to send you the following information. I noticed CERT and tale
itself. But tale claims that the problem is not a problem of pgpverify, it's
a problem of some krauts trying to send checkgroups monthly using a bot.
The checkgroups mentioned were send since a year. They do not include Date:
and Message-ID: because these values were not predictable by the human
signer and the bot does not know the passphrase to work with.
In consequence there are checkgroups out there which can be resend at any
time causing a lot of trouble, because the signature is still valid even if
a new Message-ID: and Date: line are used.
The obvious fix is to modify pgpverify to block such control messages.
ftp://ftp.iks-jena.de/pub/mitarb/lutz/ contains the necessary fixes.

@_subject: PGP flaw found by Czech firm allows dig sig to be forged 
Exactly. Furthermore overclocked customer maschines make it just more likely
to attack a PGP key using failture analysis ("Bellcore attack" in German
smartcard hacking lingo). So urge the implementors to protect against
computing errors as well.
IMNSHO the PGP paradigma to expect locally written data to be unmodified on
later read was attacked. Phil can not be sued for this paradigma because he
developed for DOS. PHP Inc might be sueable because they extended the model
to other OS. I can be sued because I forget it as well while adapting the
source to PKI needs.
PGP2.6.3(i)n has the necessary fixes.

Take me as an example. Not running DOS, but NeXTstep, Linux and HPUX (7.x).
Newest Hardware running at home is from 1991. Newest hardware running at
work (for me) is from 1996.
