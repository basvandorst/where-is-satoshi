@_subject: Random chaff [was: more work for Grobbages] 
I was thinking solely of taps capable of observing user1, user2...
If user1 injects 1.21 MB of data on one side, and 1.21 MB of data
pops out the other side at injection time + network delay, the users
are made. Regardless of whether the observer can see inside the
network/crypto or operate in the network. And especially if the net
or users are quiet at that time.
But if there's chaff present, chaff that is only known to be chaff
by the network, or minimally by the recipient and generator, then
the game becomes harder. User1 and user2's pipes are always
independantly full of cap = ( chaff + wheat). Chaff is requested
from the network by the user's node to fill the cap during idle
times. The cap could be optional random dynamic, perhaps shrink
after some time of no wheat nearing the cap so as to not be needless
Users's nodes make [close?] peers just for traffic generation.
Tagged and controlled out of band. Involve the client's knowledge
that its socks or hidden service ports are generating n kbit/sec
of wheat.
Middle node link traffic could be similarly managed, albeit without
socks/hs knowledge, just bandwidth.
Any intelligent cell based clocking or committed rate management
within seem very hard when riding on the public internet. So it
would just be shoving bits into a hungry mouth until a gag message
comes back.
Maybe the problem with this idea is that the chaff generation system
might not be able to react fast enough when the real wheat travels
the pipes. So a 1.21 MB injection might still create some sort of
observable ripple at start and end times. The only way it might not
is if the pipes are oversubscribed _and_ packet lossy by design,
not just having the usual TCP congestion managed slowness. But that
would be terrible bad for most user facing applications and stacks.
Maybe it is the ripples that need hidden or randomized instead of
just filling pipes.
It seems safe to presume that near global passive adversaries exist.
And certainly ones cabaple of covering various regions. And that
offline processing of the mesh of flow information from them is
probably within current capabilities. I'm actually amazed we're not
seeing canaries kicking off all over the place. Particularly ones
involving exits.
The advice to run a relay while using the client seems sound due
to whatever free chaff it brings. Who knows.

@_subject: [tor] Softlayer finally kicks us from their data center 
Didn't know Cogent had gone that low yet, thx. HE is more a
provider of mixed services (colo/host/transit) than traditional
pipe though.
Sure. I guess my mention of being an ISP should have said it was
for purposes of going naturally alongside direct allocation.
In a former life, I did send notices to upstream pipe as needed.
ie: If there was an issue requiring it... traceroute, lookup and mail.
So even an independant ISP, in their own room, buying circuit from
L3/etc, could have a ticket lodged at L3. That was also the point about
structuring. Companies layer and silo things as suits them.
As would many rightly do, laws of other countries don't apply. Business
seeks to minimize cost, ignoring saves cost with minimal risk.
Yep, I left that part out of my prior note. That's a big problem as far as
opening up shop as a new ISP. For this or any other purpose. Especially
if you want to keep it private [held and funded] with organic growth... no
time left for that. Save for givebacks and if IANA/etc brokers private swaps,
direct v4 allocation simply won't exist, everything will be SWIP.
The v6 net, current OS's, DNS are all ready. A fair number of popular apps,
certainly opensource ones, do v6. So yes, Tor needs to become v6 capable.
The v4 game may be played out. But given that true global v6 adoption vs
NAT everywhere has what maybe a 50/50 chance?... early v6 ISP's could
make a killing. Maybe we'll be among them :)
Oh well, kindof off topic. Cheers.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What is tor used for? 
Tor is used for a lot of different things. Sure, the kiddy pron, drug and chan
waste and all the talk about those things is disgusting to see infiltrating
everywhere. But with nothing to do about it you just have to ignore it.
Yes, it would be cool to see stuff like EFF, EPIC, ACLU, Red Cross and
whatever else makes you happy all be multihomed into the anonymous
space. But really, if you can't get to them on the clearnet, or via Tor exits,
you probably have worse problems on your hands, like finding work, food,
shelter and not getting shot. Nor do they see it as being all that
helpful to them.
On the plus side, lots of people use Tor for totally benign and boring everyday
stuff, I certainly do. Think about it... IRC with friends, dating,
reading the paper,
contributing to forums and various projects, blogging, doing your banking and
school stuff, email, internet and systems work, looking for work,
writing freely with
random people, buying stuff. Whatever it might be that people do. It
all feels just
a bit better knowing your ISP. employer or government doesn't really
have such an
easy task anymore of cataloging or quoting you, tracking your home/work/travels,
turning you into a statistic, optimizing your online experience, or
any other such
things you might not want to happen. These certainly aren't examples of 'working
for the greater global good of humanity' or whatever, but it all adds
up. Kindof how
anti-spam systems reduce the profitability of spam. And in a way,
gaining back some
of the anonymity by default that everyone had before everyone and everything
went digital, online, databased, monetized and controlled in the 90's.
It's unlikely you'll find those who really need Tor for their
activities standing up and
saying here I am with their use cases in hand. They simply have better
things to do
and that would entail risk.
You're more likely to find relay ops and coders evangelizing to the
good. They are
the interfaces to the use cases and know what's out there. Just seeing
packets flow
through the occaisional relay I prop up makes me happy knowing at least some of
them weren't full of the aforementioned trash... even if they are just
our boring
daily stuffs.

And although I might trust Tor, it's not wise to trust a GPA such

easy to presume some reverse mail covers against the sellers

at least that long for any really big sealed case to go down in
public. So we truly must wait much longer in order to presume
the statement in (4) is true.
Tor cannot accept known 'illegal' money, therefore acknowledgement
is moot. About the best Tor could do is be able to accept anonymous
donations in the first place. Then publish a bitcoin address for donations
from anyone. Then surely some unaffiliated and helpful bird would send
to SR the links to that address and to this thread.
Not sure, but I think at one point Tor accepted bitcoin, but then recanted.

This is where Phantom has a huge advantage over Tor... always on, native
IPv6 transport via tunnel interface. You don't have to create all sorts of
'only with Tor' hooked apps like come with I2P. All the software you use
today just works [1]. Just point OS, apache, games, azureus, etc into that
address space and you're done. And so long as you don't mind
src spoofing, extra setup, and some non-optimums here and there,
you can get that on Tor with onioncat today.
[1] You did IPv6 feature ticket your favorite IPv4 only app didn't you...
Torproject isn't inventing select cases, they're the only cases they
can publish.
And they do so for two reasons... 1) Attract funding 2) Attempt to stave
off legal action to shut it down... such standoff hopefully made possible
through big sticks doing the funding, and a verifiable subset of published
use cases.
There's nothing stopping anyone from forking Tor, throwing it up on
github and moving to an unfunded, unspoken development model to
do all these things.
People can even fork their own and specifically pimp it for drugs, guns,
contract killing and CP. It won't do them or Tor or either's users any

Well, very few places take cash or money order in the mail. Call
them stupid to not take the money. Then there's AML with bitcoin,
Building a persistent nym is handy if you wish to establish such a
personage for compartemented tasks, etc. However, there are linkable
nyms and unlinkable ones.
Advocating that users or sites evolve to support only linkable nyms
is not a good idea. For example, the 'invite' or 'cell number' type
nym systems are an example of terrible privacy policy.
People need the ability to create new, unlinked, taint free, accounts
whenever they want. They many need more than one persona, or to
come back as a fresh incarnation of themselves when up against
unwarranted/irrational dislike.
Linkable nyms are worthless for some people and purposes, so I've
no problem with that lack.
If I ran a system, I would allow signups from anywhere, no 'recovery'
email, no name, no cell, no geoip. Nothing but username, password,
and a few strong captchas to keep out the bots. Maybe even a time
delay (n days) to calm down the impulse users. AND definitely... a
policy that allows me to nuke misbehaving accounts at will. Because
let's be honest, if you've got the helpdesk cycles to learn all
about VPN's, scrape proxy lists, scrape Tor, sink ip's etc... you've
surely got it to sink accounts on verifiable abuse reports. Come
on people, hitting 'delete' just isn't all that hard, especially
when your policy permits it.
Do NOT penalize those who need multiple random unlinked accounts
by blocking ip's, making up nym systems, etc. Penalize the accounts
that act up. They are the bad ones, not the former.
I would actually donate much more to Tor/EFF project if I could
earmark it for a formal emissary to talk with some of the sites
I've seen implementing bad policy. And hopefully report back to me
with the positive results ...
... because when I do (under a separate unlinkable nym of course), I
end up ignored as the expendable small guy.
Exactly! And when I can't use these sites in perfectly good,
responsible, creative and nice ways... because they have implemented
crap blocking policies... it pisses me the fuck off.

Subject only to Tor's defenses, such as CIDR block restrictions, a
node is a node. Going with the USA idea: what if the FBI, in the
normal course of business, calls up all their local cable/dsl/fiber/cell
providers and has a few lines run to each office and outhouse
nationwide. Not enough nodes? Maybe they offer their workers free
internet access and give them a secure little 'router'. Or use
routing and vpn tricks to buy/borrow enough CIDR safe node IP's
from whoever and route them all back to a node farm for easier
Only the node list needs to be classified against FOIA to prevent
blockage. Once the tech is figured out to the point that product
is producible, the remaining thing is what can be legally done with
it all. Warrantless and dragnet tap projects are holding up pretty
well so far, right? Certainly targeted actions are no problem.
No news of Tor daemons being cracked to date, right? Isn't Tor full
of nodes running all sorts of untrusted software under less than
perfect admin skills? It's pretty unlikely that 'chat room' busts
use Common Criteria systems either.
There is this thread for starters:
 I would also look to make sure the timing to a node makes sense
with its presumed geolocation. It should never be shorter than
possible, nor really much longer either.

Yes. They are two separate camps. Who now more regularly talk with

It's likely only a legal question as to what tools either may use.
Then saying, 'hey, we have this program', seems not a big deal.
Based on 4+ year old methods up against a first time case.
What were the lessons learned? What gaps are being filled?
Of course. That's why I put out possible examples that would only
utilize publicly known methods. There are no secrets in anonbib.
Secret projects have secret nets with secret admins...
I'm not really suggesting that any such global or national all
seeing system is in place. Only that given budgets and current tech,
the odds are surely not zero on some of the scenarios.
Particularly concerning results available even with limited visibility.
Such as running both a HS and an entry node that a user happens to
use. Or running enough nodes that having an interesting circuit
transit all three/six is less than a rare occurance.
Scaling Note: If the network needs to scale, such as keeping nodes
very busy but not saturated, non-exit relay by default (NE-RBD)
could be metered out by way of a client self enabling it (or whatever
other scale factor) based on the client's/relay's own fingerprint.

@_subject: [p2p-hackers] Distributed filesystem choices (aka: none yet?) 
Been looking for a distributed filesystem with no luck, any ideas?
Distributed meaning that there is no single central access point.
So the concept of mounting might mean amongst the roving set able
to service it, or some underlying graph of it, something like:
mount -t dht dht:// /dist1
Users add their free block devices to the global backing store which
was initialized with certain ZFS-like integrity and redundancy
Files would never vanish unless there are no longer enough blocks
in the backing store to meet the init time guarantees.
Users could either copy their hierarchies into the space, or attach
them into the space for continued local maintenance.
The one time init setting of a space could include whether pki
recognized root users could maintain the overall hierarchy.  Uid's
might be an insertion node id.
There may need to be voting authority on file/tree expiry if under
space pressure, perhaps bitcoin-like, with the metrics established
at init time.
Users could add their block devices to whatever pool had the metrics
they like.
Anononymity and crypto would provide incentive to donate resources
since unlike say bittorrent, no legal fear means no hit and run
I don't really know what it might look like. Just that it needs
sha2/3 integrity, redundancy, and file lifetime guarantees. It needs
to be global, anonymous, and be a usable file system. And somehow
deal with abusive fill such as dd if=/dev/zero of=zero, which implies
some kind of moderated hierarchies appointed by the initializing
AFS is nice that users can bolt their filespace into the tree, and
it has filesystem semantics.
ZFS/BTRFS is nice due to their sha256 integrity, raidz redundancy
and simple backing block device ideas.
FreeNet/GnuNet/BitTorrent and all other 'filesharing' protocols are
no good because there is no guarantee that files will not vanish.
And they have no filesystem semantics, only push/fetch.
RedHat GFS / DragonFly HAMMER are interesting as a distributed
filesystem in which real work can be done on live files.
Tahoe-LAFS is nice due to adding in block devices, but no good
because of the central access point. Perhaps that could be distributed?
Phantom/I2P/Tor could be used as the backend IP transport.
The only thing that makes it worth while is that a lot of people
have free space, want to give an get data, safely, and don't want
to see their work in populating it wasted... so it can't go away.

Resnick: The recent article in Wired describes where and how the NSA plans to
store its share of collected data. But as the article explains, the Utah
facility will have another important function: cryptanalysis, or
code-breaking, as much of the data cycling through will be heavily encrypted.
It also suggests that the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), expected to
remain durable for at least another decade, may be cracked by the NSA in a
much shorter time if theybve built a secret computer that is considerably
faster than any of the machines we know about. But more to the pointbis
encryption safe?
Guessing it's pretty much as on the wrapper. In another interview
Binney speaks of a cryptographic breakthrough. If you look at the
physical size of the datacenters, you can easily envision massive
index tables, rainbow or otherwise, for storing shortcuts to various
projects. Note that ever since MySpace, network analysis has been
the rage. Combine that with 15-20 years of public datamining and
10-15 years of easily tappable fiber and datacenters. Toss in some
really smart people and PhD's and sure, there are bound to be some
big and secret advances in data processing and even crypto in play
You don't need big DC's for that, just better software and human

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and P2P 
Allow me to combine some quotes from this recent thread alone...
It seems pretty clear we are at the point where there are current
and growing ideas and demand for all manner of anonymous P2P services.
In part driven by global news, and thus global awareness, that
governments, business and others have questionable regard for
privacy, etc.
And if consumers continue to demand and drive openness into products,
there will soon come a day when open, BSD/Linux capable, pad devices
(PC + wifi + cell) the size of a DVD case are common. Demand,
compounded by utility.
Regardless of the capacity for the sort of projects listed below
to handle it, people WILL build these services. Some of them are
out there today, and being largely unknown, they are performing
well enough. More users will try them and adopt them based on need,
utility and performance. The only question is how will the networks
perform at each stage of popularity.
Given that these services are surely coming in force... and from
directions that see these networks more as a raw transport than
say, primarily for the purposes outlined on their respective web
pages... it seems the usual echo of "we're a nice project, don't
do that, too much load" may not be useful. This should not imply
fault, but merely suggest that it's dated and hopeless.
And since the networks are anonymous, countermeasures would affect
all users matching the metric, even those using it for said purposes.
So maybe there's room for more focused/funded research into the
actual impacts of different traffic models (leading to proper
resource giveback by apps/users/groups), development improvement
in the networks to handle the traffic, even up to creating an
entirely new anonymous network optimized for P2P ...
... before this certainty happens.
Do what is needed to go forth and conquer :)
P2P services should look at the current strong anonymization projects
that could provide transport. The ones I know of are:
More links are welcome.
People should not make the mistake of assuming they can freely use
any network without negative impact. Including fatal impact for
their own service. They should offer sufficient resources back to
the network. Contrary to popular belief, P2P is not a free ride.
Relay, directory and index is expensive and the cost is bandwidth,
CPU and storage.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and P2P 
Is, or can Tor be, useful or optimal? On which platforms? With what
P2P apps or traffic patterns?
Assuming these are the only cores available at this time...
Running a P2P app will require running one of the above cores. Which
means all peers already have access to each core's internal addressing
scheme, respectively: i2p, private IPv6, onion. And thus they have access
to each other.
So though Tor is unique in having exit facilities by design, those
facilities are not needed for a global P2P mesh to work.
Tor's uniqueness and its perhaps as yet uncharacterized ability to
handle certain P2P loads should lead to a comparative review of the
utility of other cores.
If you can speak IPv6, you can speak Phantom, which makes app
development incredibly simple. Written in C. Probably the lightest
weight core so far. Needs some review. Presents a native, node
specific, source address.
I2P has the most network experience so far with lots of P2P connections
going on, ala bittorrent. More work is needed to interface apps
with it. Written in Java. Does not present a native, node specific,
source address?
If you need to use exit for other things, you may not have room to
run multiple cores, provide some resources back, etc. So Tor would
make sense in that case. Does not present a native, node specific,
source address.
There are certainly more comparisons to be made.
It does provide an IPv6 interface/layer, that is definitely a win since
you can use all the usual network programming methods and apps.
It is not a P2P app, only a shim for Tor and I2P. And it needs
further work to provide IPv6 to HS/I2P PKI authentication. I might
be inclined to sign all the traffic ala IPSEC before attempting
some ping pong scheme.
On a big scale, it might make sense for all the anonymous networks
to use interfaces and IPv6 node addresses for interop purposes.
Though there are some current problems there... Tor's 80 bits may
be too small, I2P's 256 is wider than can be packed under an IPv6/48.

I likely ran into some of this a while back with something I was

If you're expecting to be doing lots of session initiation, I think
you're going to hit some significant local CPU issues, especially
those of you thinking of P2P applications running on "smaller than
laptop" devices. An occaisional message in the manner in which you
might normally 'text', would work ok. But if you expect to have
some sort of pidgin/sip buddy list full of status and people bouncing
around doing things, it could become ugly. Certainly far worse for
torrenting as the extreme example. And when thousands of people
come online with P2P like that... yeah.
On the other hand, once the session state is up, things seem better
and you're back to the usual latency, bandwidth and reliability
limits of the relay system.
P2P doesn't generally keep sessions up, so it's back to step one.
So it would be interesting to see where this could go.
- Extending circuit and other timeouts for hidden services?
- Storing related TCP or Tor states locally?

bit of extra setup for that is all.
They use it a lot for that. Admittedly I really should learn more
about the full mechanics of this one.
When I last looked briefly at this one a couple years back, the
users were not necessarily anonymous to each other. It seemed to
require users to know and/or trust one another. If that was the
case, anonymous transport layer would have been required underneath
it to match the level of anonymity the three projects I listed.
Maybe they solved that since then?

@_subject: [tor-relays] BitTorrent complaint 
As opposed to torrenting via exits, I'm amazed more people haven't
moved their torrenting to operate entirely within anonymous networks.
The performance of I2P and Tor (and I guess Phantom during tests) is
actually quite usable so long as the user excercises content selection
and patience. And regarding this thread, the freedom of operators and
users from complaints regarding takedown would be invaluable.
I'm not sure if these networks could scale to handle the node count
and chatter, but I think the bit about spare cycles is right and might
even act as a natural limiter to that sort of traffic. For instance, my
tests show that establishing connections to many onions in parallel
is quite costly and prone to failure without available headroom. But
once connected, things are ok.
Perhaps torrenters simply can't put aside their 'must download it all
right now' mentality which keeps them away from our nodes. Or there
is a major influx waiting to happen upon some future enlightenment
whether they're misguided or not.

According to the speed of light, anything under a certain maximum time
from you is local. If all you had was a list of nodes, RTT could be used
to determine a global path made up of small hops less likely to be directly
monitored themselves. Hop count would rise with longer paths and
performance drops... so perhaps only useful for creating local clusters.
TTL and RTT above a minimum time are spoofable so not nearly as useful.

Independant mail nodes can work if done well, that's
essentially what TorMail, Lavabit, SC, Hush, etc are.
And though you may encrypt the body, there are uses

the weaknesses, your tools, and pick the right one for

No, that is old model. Yet how ahead and gracious are the punks?
imap4[s only], submission[starttls only], transport smtp[s preferred,
and fixed keyed amongst peers], nothing asked for but username and
password, allow connections from anywhere including Tor, simple
documentation for the user (thunderbird, mutt, outlook, openpgp,

The demand for these things is very high right now.
You don't need to offer webmail.
The setup is not hard.
There could be 30 new mail providers running around the globe in
three months.
All of them teaching the user how to encrypt, exactly where
it belongs.
And that's just for simple mail, a big win, even without resorting
to more exotic  systems.
Unless it is the user who keeps and manages their own keys, no
service with any 'offer of encryption that actually protects' can
ever be true. Services are classed by who manages the keys. Any
service that manages keys on behalf of the user and claims to offer
protection is nothing more than a false marketing SCAM.
Unfortunately, people keep buying the bullshit.

deny an influx of attacking nodes overtaking the network. It surely
cannot be relegated to the simple user? So that seems 'hard' to me.
For example, I think Tor may remain centralish rather than pure
dhtish for that purpose. But what if the centrality was undertaken
anonymously by some voting humans (or their analytic nodes). Their track

consideration the user had, including... now hang on, I know this will

These days, there is a want for secure messaging. Thanks to recent

now want to 'send secret messages'. I don't have time so the standard
answer is usually 'read and pick something from prism-break.org.'
There are already cleanslate systems cryptographically
secure against content and internal addressing snooping.
The resistance to global passive/active adversaries
from connecting the realworld IP talkers needs work.
And to truly replace traditional email (especially in the
business world) you will need a community of powerful
messaging clients...  lots of spec decisions to be made
there... lots of traction with existing thunderbird, mutt,
etc UI/handling frontends. But can you save that and
swap out their legacy smtp/imap network semantics.
Then you have the userspace key management for end2end
message security to work on as well.
All of this is interconnected too... once you start designing
a strong messaging system, it begins to look like a general
purpose transport, possibly one with parameterized options.
Then you start thinking how to plug other apps into it. So
you're back to looking like another I2P, Tor, GnuNet, Phantom,
Freenet, AnoNet, etc... lots of the same stuff under the hood.
Will there ever be a generic, possibly modular, overlay to

@_subject: [tor-talk] About time to make BitTorrent work over Tor, 
Technically, Bittorrent works fine when run completely inside Tor.
The resources needed at the client are reasonable (ie: cpu).
The bandwidth is currently reasonably available. And onions are
secure enough for people who insist on skirting copyright. That
alone makes me wonder why Tor hasn't grown any long lived
torrent clouds. Probably because the entry bar is high and the
slower speed is beyond the scope of the typical leeching
What people should know is that Tor currently can't handle it at
scale in at least two areas...
Transferring 1MiB causes about 7MiB worth of reduction in Tor
bandwidth, plus the CPU and state for processing the circuits.
You can get that back by running relays, but the vast bulk of the
above users probably won't be willing or bothered to do that, let
alone be able to figure out how to do it right and in conjunction
with their BT app. So Tor is likely to tank from that alone.
Then assuming they did run relays, the last part is dealing with
N million users worth of relay and onion descriptors. That takes
out more bandwidth, the dirservers, and everyone's local cpu
and ram.
For those reasons, it's hard to truly push mass use of p2p over
Tor. Yet I think given the greater probability of a p2p influx as
time goes on [1], Tor really should have some prepared design
considerations on the table beyond "please don't do that",
which torrenters obviously ignore. Hopefully designs can be
found that aren't restrictive.
[1] Pick any hot p2p app, drop N million users worth on Tor. In
this thread it's BT... being driven slowly towards anonymous
systems by the anti's [today, Russian blocking], enhanced

I should have been more clear on the topic of my note... right now we
have really good content encryption for I2P/Tor/etc type networks. And
pretty good intelligently random multi hop routing mechanisms.
But because of our silly desire to not fill our pipes with chaff,
we've made it easier in some cases for GPA's [1] to watch and
connect the inputs/outputs across a relatively silent backbone...

N kbps to the net and fill it, and everyone else picks their commit rate

Tor does not currently scale as simply as that. Therefore whatever
you try to scale on top of Tor will not scale either. All using exits will
do (roughly speaking) is cause Tor to fail 1/2 as fast as using the
purely internal approach would. BT is further badly hampered since
UDP and inbound bindings are unavailable under the current exit model.
Tor's design is generally "move a lot of browsers over a few exits",
anything else is bonus, at least historically. At the moment, if you're
trying to move to millions of p2p users, not just hundreds of tinkerers,
you're better off enhancing Tor first or writing or finding another secure
transport that scales better. Then moving it all off the clearnet once and
for all. But that appears to be beyond the typical scope of thinking in the
BT space, you know, because it's not fast and it's sooo harrrddddd man.
Tor is good stuff, but like anything else, only good when used within
its model. Supposedly i2p welcomes torrenting. Millions? Ask i2p.

Yet only a tiny amount of data about the crypto. True, we can infer data about

You can't fix email as we know it today using todays bolt-ons,

The only way to have any real global seamless success is to go
ground up with a completely new model. IMO, that will be some
form of p2p message system where every address is a crypto key,
masked for grandma by her contact list, decrypted out your p2p
daemon and piped into your local mail processing (MUA/filter/lists)
and filesystem (encryption). At least that way your local mail tools
will still work (no one will give those up anyway).
The problem is the antique centralized backend, it needs bypassed.

With p2p model and every node as a key/address, you don't
need 'pgp' because the node is the key and does lookups and

the usual tools around message bodies if desired for additional
encrypt/auth or if you're disk isn't encrypted. P2P daemon
takes over and all the old transport headers go away.
Spam/AV becomes another local daemon. Mailing lists are
a repeater node someone runs, or the usual local mailman stuff.

References: Moving the last couple days talk to this thread seems fine.
Though unclear, that sounds like the old trust of a CA/PKI system problem.
In general I suggest that people wish to use messaging with each other
once they already know them (or have some other trusted web to them).
As in, Hey John, nice to meet ya today, what's your key (address), I'll
message you later. Or Hey Jane, what's John's address. Same for
employers, businesses, etc. Such peer groups bootstrap and grow
very fast. Thus the perceived need for a cold lookup of Ralf, isn't much of
a real one.
Once you know the address (node crypto key), you put it 'To: ',
mua hands to spool, p2p daemon reads spool, looks up key in DHT and
sends msg off across the transport to the far key (node) when it is
reachable. Hopefully the transport looks like I2P/Tor in being a secure
random hop layer. In fact, those could probably be used today, they
have the keys as nodes and user facing ports for inbound/outbound
daemons. They just need scaling work to n-billion nodes (users,
aka: the hard part). People are already plugging postfix, bittorrent,
etc into these networks.
Tor is not currently addressible at the user level by the full key,
it 'shortens' the key into a 16char onion address. As you may be
hinting at... yes, that is bad... collisions, and needing secondary lookup
layers into the full key. Tor may be moving to full key addressibility
soon, see tor-dev for that.
I2P (and Phantom, and probably GnuNet) are addressible with full keys.
So you can send to 'account at key' with them if you want, and keep the
John/Jane/Ralf human style lookups in your MUA addressbook (once
you know them) without needing a secondary lookup layer into the full key.
No, I am not sure. But when looking at some of the p2p transport
layers that have come along so far, it seems like a fairly strong
possibility for a new backend transport model while retaining user
level mail tools... mutt, maildrop, mailman, Thunderbird, etc. Most
of what you'd need there is support for very long addresses and
split horizon handoff to local daemon/spool based on recognizing
what the destination net is... .onion, .i2p, etc.
I'd like to read what Pond and I2P-Bote are doing with some parts of
this as well.
I don't believe you need a trusted CA/PKI service to successfully
bootstrap users and their addresses/keys into a new global messaging
system. If I want to know what some unknown like Bruce's key is, I'll
look it up on his website, social net, list posts, etc. If that's what you

My first take was that it stores the messages in the DHT,

wrong as I read more later.
I think that's working now. And is the general idea, create a strong
overlay network with a frontend MUA's can speak to.
As an aside: If you can make that overlay net present an IPv6 tunnel
interface on the local host, that lets you use any IPv6 enabled
app over it. I'm doubting the world needs a dozen application
specific overlay networks. More like just a few classes of network.
- message based store and forward
- low latency IPv6 transport

Everyone knows there are active attacks against
'Tor' users... ie: the apps they attach to it. Those are
cheap wins for the adversary and unrelated to Tor.
There are attempts to exploit Tor daemon and other various
access to 0wn or run the relays themselves to get at the
plaintext or the service running behind Tor. Not much
to do there but harden Tor and the relays and run more
independant ones. And nobody's cracking the crypto on
the wire anytime soon. Those aren't really related to
Tor, but standard practice.
Tor can have it's hidden services found via various
published attacks involving deploying analysis nodes.
There are caveats, and the cost isn't that much, but
it takes time. It's in the papers.
I'd caution on one debated thing about adversaries... we know
there are at least a few adversaries in the world that have *very*
good regional coverage with network taps. So contrary
to some opinions, I'd suggest it would be rather possible for them
to use those and determine who is talking to who by correlating
traffic passing the taps... if your traffic happened to begin and
end within that region it could be game over. That's in the
papers too.
Low latency nets that do not use fill traffic are simply
not resistant to timing/correlation attacks. Tor is low latency
and does not use fill traffic. It's not a break, it's a design
choice/tradeoff. Depending on how you use these networks,
it may or may not be an issue for you.
Tor was never meant to do everything, yet it's quite good
at what it does, and publishing what it doesn't.

This probably can't be mentioned enough. Millions to billions
of gates on a die, lots of room there. Multiplied out to the
millions to billions of computers in service. That's a huge
opportunity no one in their right mind wouldn't try to exploit.
And RNG's are an easy place to do it. RNG is not a box
you can input 2+2 test vector from the outside and get 4
back out. The RNG may even look random, pass diehard, etc.
But if there's a secret seed buried in the RNG somewhere,
you're screwed. And when was the last time anyone ever publicly
decapped and validated a current Intel RNG CPU? Sure, mix it in with at least one other source, or shutdown, and
use that. But don't ever use it raw. Embedded RNG's help make
the market for external discrete logic RNG dongles.

@_subject: The next gen P2P secure email solution 
This thread pertains specifically to the use of P2P/DHT models
to replace traditional email as we know it today. There was
a former similarly named thread on this that diverged... from the
concept and challenge of P2P/DHT handling the transport and
lookups... back to more traditional models. This thread does not
care about those antique models, please do not take it there.
In short, we're attempting to examine and develop some form
of new transport that looks somewhat like a mix between secure
anonymous networks, string at pubkey node addressing, massive
decentralized dht-like scaling and finally a user facing daemon that
moves messages into and out of local spools for use by normal
user/system tools.
Pasting in a very rough and unflowing thread summary to date
for interested people to pick up and discuss, draft, etc.
How many times has this been rehashed the last six months?
You can't fix email as we know it today using todays bolt-ons,
protocols and corporate stakeholders/services trying to profit from it.
The only way to have any real global seamless success is to go
ground up with a completely new model. IMO, that will be some
form of p2p message system where every address is a crypto key,
masked for grandma by her contact list, decrypted out your p2p
daemon and piped into your local mail processing (MUA/filter/lists)
and filesystem (encryption). At least that way your local mail tools
will still work (no one will give those up anyway).
The problem is the antique centralized backend, it needs bypassed.
You've got neat stuff like Tor, bittorrent, bitcoin, etc already... so
boost email into the 2020's the same way. Then let the old world
email services try to keep up, and slowly die like everything else.
Obviously. It will never be able to escape the non-body
header content and third party routing, storage and analysis with
any form of patching over today's mail. And it's completely
ridiculous that people continue to invest [aka: waste] effort in
'securing' it. The best you'll ever get clients down to is exposing
a single 'To:' header within an antique transport model that
forces you to authenticate to it in order to despam, bill, censor
and control you.
That system is cooked, done and properly fucked. Abandon it.
What the world needs now is a real peer to peer messaging
system that scales. Take Tor for a partial example... so long
as all the sender/recipient nodes [onions] are up, any message
you send will get through, encrypted, in real time. If a recipient
is not up, you queue it locally till they are... no third party ever
needed, and you get lossless delivery and confirmation for free.
Unmemorable node address?, quit crying and make use of your
local address book. Doesn't have plugins for current clients?,
so what, write some and use it if you're dumb enough to mix
the old and new mail.
The only real problem that still needs solved is scalability...
what p2p node lookup systems are out there that will handle
a messaging world's population worth of nodes [billions] and
their keys and tertiary data? If you can do that, you should
be able to get some anon transport over the p2p for free.
Anyway, p2p messaging and anonymous transports have
all been dreamed up by others before. But now is the
time to actually abandon traditional email and just do it.
If you build it, they will come.
I'm strongly against most the ideas to abbandon current email systems,
because the results will be to create wallet garden.
We need something interoperable with existing systems or the system will
just be used by a bunch of paranoid people or fostered by the marketing
of few cryptography company acquiring customers, not user.
It would be interoperable with current end user interfaces/tools, but not
directly with you at some.dotcom.
As with everything else, today's seeds grow into tomorrows garden, sometimes
you just have to thorougly plow under last year's chaff first, that's by design.
E-mail is basically business correspondence.
    - E-mail is stored.
    - E-mail is sent to many people outside your personal social network.
    - Business recipients of email are often subject to corporate and/or
      regulatory policy constraints that are in conflict with end-to-end
      encryption.
The above list of features can be greatly expanded, and the
consequences elaborated, but I doubt may on this list truly need
to be re-educated about email.
So I will confidently predict that end-to-end secure email will
remain a niche service used by a tiny minority.
Even businesses that one might expect to implement at least encryption
to the "gateway", are in many cases choosing to out-source their
gateway to 3rd-party providers (anti-spam and anti-virus offerings
only work with un-encrypted email, and in many cases the provider
also operates the entire mail store).
[and others also said: tls, dane, skype, smime, ca's, smtp, etc]
Medical, Financial
Nothing here changes, only the backend transport between nodes.
Once your node decrypts the message to your local system pipes,
you can do all this and more with it. Including running a 'business' node
and doing whatever you want with the plaintext after your node daemon
passes it to you. This is not about those ancient protocols. It's also
about 'messaging' not strictly 'email'... those lines are already well
blurred, no need to distinguish between them anymore. A 'light'
messaging client could simply ignore the non transport email headers,
or use your standard msg at nodekey address.
Please do not continue to talk about antique tradional centralized
systems in this thread, except of course to bash and route around them.
The speed of a real P2P/DHT replacement at scale is a research challenge.
this would make an interesting bet!  i too believe this to be
impossible given the constraints.
I'm not so sure about this, look at all the global resources being poured
into traditional email, and attempts to 'fix' it. Now redirect fractional 1%
of those resources and put them into a P2P replacement. That's ftw.
Say hello to Bote mail on I2P.
I2P provides encrypted anonymizing networking, Bote mail provides DHT
based serverless encrypted mailing with public crypto keys as
addresses (ECDSA or NTRU).
 and i2pbote.i2p (if you don't have I2P installed, add
.us to visit it via an inproxy).
There is also I2P Messenger that is encrypted P2P IM within I2P also
using public keys as addresses.
You may have a look of "I2P Bote" it is severless, encrypted mail
system, address is the public key, P2P based... nice tool.
  As in another post of mine, I'll be looking at that again.
My first take was that it stores the messages in the DHT,
which didn't seem scalable or reliable at all. I may be
wrong as I read more later.
I think that's working now. And is the general idea, create a strong
overlay network with a frontend MUA's can speak to.
As an aside: If you can make that overlay net present an IPv6 tunnel
interface on the local host, that lets you use any IPv6 enabled
app over it. I'm doubting the world needs a dozen application
specific overlay networks. More like just a few classes of network.
- message based store and forward
- low latency IPv6 transport
- data storage and retrieval
Bote mail doesn't have to be used for it's anonymous properties, for
me that is just a bonus. For many people it is more than enough to be
able to know that it is impossible for anybody else than the intended
recipient to read the message thanks to public key addressing.
Guaranteed end-to-end security if you can verify the address.
I don't think anything that doesn't fundamentally rely on public key
addressing is the (long term) future. There will inevitably issues
otherwise, including more issues of the type we have with CA:s today.
For those who want to make it more user friendly, nothing stops you
from adding a transparent "address translation layer" where servers
are involved. When you want to send a message to a person with a human
readable address at a server, then the server could then reply with
the public key based address to the mail client, and the user would
have the option to see what that address is. It could even be logged
by the client, with TOFU/POP style trust system that reduces the
amount of trust you have to place in the server. No need to trust
anybody with plaintext.
I suggest such interfacing with the current legacy system will only prolong
it's long past due extinction. Build a better system and let them come to you,
not the other way around. And bolting in exits will only make it harder to
do correctly and optimally what you need to do as a P2P system. Please,
just forget about interfacing with the legacy transport system. If you really
need that you can run your own p2p daemon node that acts as your
automated gateway between the two. This is mostly about design of
the p2p side, not that.
It is my understanding of the proposed replacement for email.  Magic
email addresses that in fact correspond to an identifier of a public
key, for example the hash of a rule that identifies the public key,
and which result in your message not in fact being passed along by
email protocols.
If you're not going to send directly to the very long account at nodepubkey, then
yes, you'll need to create another layer on top to hold your h(key). However,
the key must still be obtainable behind that since that is what the messages
will ultimately be encrypted and routed to. It's not much of a stretch beyond
that to ensure userland mail tools can handle say 8k long addresses. I'm not
against such a [vanity/shorthash] layer.
Bote mail and I2P messenger are two pieces of serverless software that
ALREADY is public key addressed within I2P. Have you tried them? You
need to add the public keys of the recipients to be able to send a
message to start with, although the DHT based search system Seedless
allow you to publish Bote mail addresses to the network.
(IMAP support for Bote mail is planned but not yet implemented, right
now it has a local web interface.)
Maybe Namecoin could work together with them to enable you to register
your key addresses to your nickname in a secure manner, but then you
still have to have a globally unique nickname and tell people the
exact spelling.
Though unclear, that sounds like the old trust of a CA/PKI system problem.
In general I suggest that people wish to use messaging with each other
once they already know them (or have some other trusted web to them).
As in, Hey John, nice to meet ya today, what's your key (address), I'll
message you later. Or Hey Jane, what's John's address. Same for
employers, businesses, etc. Such peer groups bootstrap and grow
very fast. Thus the perceived need for a cold lookup of Ralf, isn't much of
a real one.
Once you know the address (node crypto key), you put it 'To: ',
mua hands to spool, p2p daemon reads spool, looks up key in DHT and
sends msg off across the transport to the far key (node) when it is
reachable. Hopefully the transport looks like I2P/Tor in being a secure
random hop layer. In fact, those could probably be used today, they
have the keys as nodes and user facing ports for inbound/outbound
daemons. They just need scaling work to n-billion nodes (users,
aka: the hard part). People are already plugging postfix, bittorrent,
etc into these networks.
Tor is not currently addressible at the user level by the full key,
it 'shortens' the key into a 16char onion address. As you may be
hinting at... yes, that is bad... collisions, and needing secondary lookup
layers into the full key. Tor may be moving to full key addressibility
soon, see tor-dev for that.
I2P (and Phantom, and probably GnuNet) are addressible with full keys.
So you can send to 'account at key' with them if you want, and keep the
John/Jane/Ralf human style lookups in your MUA addressbook (once
you know them) without needing a secondary lookup layer into the full key.
No, I am not sure. But when looking at some of the p2p transport
layers that have come along so far, it seems like a fairly strong
possibility for a new backend transport model while retaining user
level mail tools... mutt, maildrop, mailman, Thunderbird, etc. Most
of what you'd need there is support for very long addresses and
split horizon handoff to local daemon/spool based on recognizing
what the destination net is... .onion, .i2p, etc.
I'd like to read what Pond and I2P-Bote are doing with some parts of
this as well.
I don't believe you need a trusted CA/PKI service to successfully
bootstrap users and their addresses/keys into a new global messaging
system. If I want to know what some unknown like Bruce's key is, I'll
look it up on his website, social net, list posts, etc. If that's what you
I feel like I walking in halfway into a conversation, I'm guessing this
started on the cryptography list that I'm not on.
Your DHT comment caught my attention though.  What in particular about
DHTs don't seem scalable or reliable?
Seems like DHTs are regularly in the 5-10M range and I don't see any
reason that DHTs couldn't be 10 times that.
Any reasonable churn rate and reliability could be handled with
replication.  The bit-torrent DHT for instance claims that 45% of users
that bootstrap from a central node are reachable 15 minutes later.  So
typical setups involve 8 nodes per bin, and 20 bins.  So every 15
minutes you ping 160 hosts, only reach 45%, and do some work to
repopulate the missing slots.
Given the simplicity of the bit-torrent DHT I think there's plenty of
room for improvement.  Larger routing tables are obvious (at the cost of
more network bandwidth to track peers).
The most promising idea for DHT improvements I've seen is to divide
peers into 3 latency groups.  High, medium, and low.   Much like L1
cache, L2 cache, and main memory.  That way common queries are very
fast, yet all queries still to find keys globally.
Bittorrent is already in the 100m node range. That's not enough. This
needs to replace every possible messaging user on the planet over
the duration of their actiive lifetime. That's at least a couple billion nodes.
Don't forget, you can always use disk to cache things.
But at the same time the system has to not say, "I can't deliver your
message to that person because an invisible gnotzaframmit that I won't
describe to you seems to be unavailable to me in the flabogrommit."
Address books as usual. Name layer if need be. We are humans, we
learn new lexicons, we write manuals, that part is nothing to be afraid of.
Being afraid only holds you back.
This is an interesting idea, because it provides certificates on
demand for ordinary users, if they decide to sign up to a certain
site. The
certs are then being used for other purposes, so the site does act as a
bootstap for using crypto. The one thing that this proposal relies on is
the availability of a common piece of software (user agent) that stores
the private key for the user. It's this part of the picture where things
get tricky.
There can be no non-distributed/redundant elements in this p2p system,
aka: no 'sites', certainly none with a realworld IP on them, and none where
very high percentages of them vanishing will disrupt the system for others.
This must replace email, therefore system disruption is intolerable.

Encryption is only part of it. There's transport, elimination of
central storage, anonymity, p2p, etc. Many things people want
simply can't be done with modifications to the current system.
With p2p model and every node as a key/address, you don't
need 'pgp' because the node is the key and does lookups and
encrypt2dest / decrypt2you for you. But you can still use pgp with
the usual tools around message bodies if desired for additional
encrypt/auth or if you're disk isn't encrypted. P2P daemon
takes over and all the old transport headers go away.
Spam/AV becomes another local daemon. Mailing lists are
a repeater node someone runs, or the usual local mailman stuff.
It's a transport replacement, so business can use it account at node.
All the MTA's [connected directly to the internet] die off in time.

I think this is one of many design choices to be made.
Extra bandwidth is hard to avoid, unless the topology is
point(sender)-to-point(recipient). Yet with that, there is no effort made
to hide who is physically talking to who. We want to try to defeat this
type of analysis, so we can't be simply point-to-point.
 ie: bittorrent and today's email are point-to-point, no multihop.
Next is storage (mix) vs. latency (tunnels). This seems less clear to
me when up against analysis. Filling circuits (tunnels) with chaff
seems interesting. And with deliverey directly to your recipient over
some tunnel circuit, you don't have to build in complex message redundancy
protocols (more storage float outstanding) to ensure your message 100%
gets there when 90% of the nodes go offline taking your stored message
with them. You also get direct realtime delivery confirmation too.
The question arises, how does one provide free anonymous transport
to those anons who simply can't pay because they are anon? How
do you 'get users' when the mentality is 'for free'? Bittorrent/Tor are
free and seem to work ok. Though it's also probably not unreasonable
to suggest (and harder to enforce) that you get 1:1 what resources you
donate to it. ie: I need to push 1GiB this month, so I need to provision at
minimum 1+Nx1GiB to do that... 1 for me, Nx1 for the net due to my use
(where N is some impact ratio inherent in the design of the net, such
as number hops.)

I'd assume the design will rightly provide complete end2end encryption between
your source spool and your recipients spool over whatever bits are in between,
as a result of having the key, equivalent to the node, equivalent to
the address.
Store and forward might need to expose only the destination key to the storage
and routing net. A direct circuit would not.
All the legacy 'received' headers are gone by definition. A full raw message
might contain some required bits for continued use with your favorite mail tools
post handoff to you:
recipient. Since the net itself would seem to need to be anonymous, then it is
likely not. Nor is it a problem if it is... you just generate yourself
a new node if concerned.
To, Cc, Bcc
Antispam/antivirus becomes responsibility of the sender/recipient so no
headers there. No legacy dkim, spf, etc, either.
There may be a new set of transport preference headers if the design calls
for it. ie: You might be able to use the net with full mail clients
like mutt, thunderbird.
Or with a light 'messaging' client protocol. Each of which might have
a slightly different
interface into and out of the node.
Addresses might look like:
[user/function or protocol/arbitrary string] pubkey/hash]
I've no idea, only to see if interested people think some sort of nextgen
P2P/DHT system is actually possible at scale.

You spam out links to binaries no one's heard of, your source probably
isn't deterministic to your binaries, bsd/linux support?, your development
model doesn't appear open, code is hosted on a site few care about anymore,
you've no papers, presentations, mailing list or community involvement,
you've advertised the good name of other projects as being affiliated with

Afaik, skype used a central lookup to get to unknown peers, not a DHT.
So they perhaps knew who wanted to talk to who. Of course now skype
is untrusted by anyone with a clue.
Sure, there's a class of users that want this, a big class. They can
have and use their modified legacy centralized email as they wish.
There's another big class that want's something more than that.
We're also going to see faster hardware, lighter code, and maybe
even wearable battery packs... because as you say, these users
want it all and are willing to go to almost any means to get it.
There could also be ways to make the heavier weight anonymous
routing p2p transport let these lightweight clients stub in just to make a
direct p2p connection for encrypted voip/messaging (if say you
published your node as accepting that option).
We're exploring ideas. What is to say we are able to develop into it some
kind of automaton taho-lafs delivery storage nodes. Storing messages in
transit under some expiry policy is not a huge space concern. So who knows.
Maybe everyone with their uber important phones will end
up VPN to their home/colo servers where the horsepower is.
Predicting mobile is hard. Throw more apps out there and your
$30-50/mo unlimited data plans go away. Now is everyone going
to pay $150+/mo for that? Where is free open wifi going to end up
spanning? And so many other things.
What I think is clear is that there will for the far to indefinite forseeable
future be some form of real workstation/laptop in the home and office.
Phones just can't replace that. Maybe we're seeing something in how
you see larger tablet/netbooks/laptops with headsets being carried about
now as if it is natural. And lots of those people will want a highly
secure system to communicate over with their peers in this new
world of disgustingly gratuitous surveillance and databasing.
I would not underestimate the demand for that sort of a comms system.
That could be the multimodal thing above. Or the in network thing.
DSPAM, spamassassin, clamav and the like do fairly well enough
on their own locally.
I suggest not cataloging a defeatist list of what you think you can't
do... but rather what you could do, what you would gain and what
could happen if you build it :)
That's why you should be doing the development of these new
protocols entirely within existing secure networks such as Tor
and I2P. And why you should bootstrap via peers instead of
clearnet authorities like Tor that can be shutdown... it's a little
less secure, but you can have in network authorities wrapped
in web of trust and then rejoin listening only to them later. And
if clearnet get''s that bad, it becomes a freedom of speech issue
which is well, SHTF time.

It is easy to write code. Harder to write it securely. Even harder to spot
your own mistakes. And unless perfect written from the start, will need
reviewed and fixed. Yet time to review and fix is not as free as the time
writing it, is often viewed as a chore, and happens far less than open
source assumes it does.
Are we developed enough to begin putting together lists of most critical
libraries/tools/apps and pipelining them through a crowdfunded independant

No, CPU is cheap and largely sits idle, particularly for limited nodes.
You are your own provider, often protected by current provider law.
So run things, a mesh, a node, whatever might be of interest. Noting
whatever contract law you wish to recognize...
As is no different than any other country.
Then further develop heuristic science, markov windows, various
local classifiers and distributed consensus subscriptions, non
soley IP based things.
Stop chickening out and relying on sole services, complain according
to your inalienable rights, stay strong and force the market to
incorporate and honor distributed ones.
There's been talk of coordinating a next gen mix mail deployment, tor/i2p
nodes, etc... well those are already sunk costs, same as your own internet
connection is, so give them a domain and call it free/bitcoin email up to 25k
accounts per node. Today that's a few thousand nodes or 75mil people.
Much costlier to produce/demand session keys from 3k nodes around the
world than from say google's 10.
Yes, people should openly publish invitations to their technology tests,
joining up in them to qualify the technologies and models would be a
good thing.
We need to break free of this simple 'get it all in one place' mentality.
Start signing your current apparrent node into a global DHT.
Start looking at things like diaspora.
Start distributing services.
Start using anonymization and encryption by default.

No, you're right. That that single, assumed to be legitimate,
and first introduced key, is trusted and used for all subsequent
encounters. Any later unvalidated change in key would indicate
suspect brokenness. Authentication of said former key, via any
particular mechanism, is a secondary bonus.
For instance, you may first check mail to a given fingerprint
gets you to the mail/context you expect. Then a web search
of that fingerprint may yield independent bloggers affirming their
similar expierience, then some reasonable trust of that
key is established.
Though it is encouraged that such lone keys be signed
by some web of trust that you can then reach. This new
environment of weak CA's will, in hope, yield a stronger
more articulated sense of what we all are signing for
each other.

GoldBug.sf.net: Secure Instant Messenger V0.1 has been released -
with p2p Email and decentral IRC public chat
While today thousands of members of the Stop-Watching-Us initiative
against surveillance programs like PRISM demonstrated in several
cities all around the globe, the EFF in conjunction with the Chaos
Computer Club announced a new secure Instant Messenger called:
GoldBug.sf.net (
Next to chat as well a serverless Email-System and public IRC-Chat has
been introduced with Multi-Encryption: a kind of PGP secured with AES
over SSL. The new protocol driving this is called "Echo" and has many
potentials to be deployed as well for further secure and anonymous
communication applications.
Some net communities already call it the Neuland Messenger due to the
Font Name of the Logo.
StopWatching.Us [3] is the initiative half a million web users have
signed due to the mass-surveillance programs like PRISM in USA;
TEMPORA in Great Britain, MICS in France and XKEYSCORE Software as
well deployed e.g. in Germany. While the governments are powerless in
regard to prevent foreign agencies to grab internet-line data and to
protect their citizens' privacy, the end-users themself are forced to
encrypt their communication and stand up for their Human
Rights.Thousands of facebook [4] and twitter [5] members declared to
demonstrate on the streets on (last) Saturday, July 27, in many
decentral cities.
As well at this date, the first release of the Secure Instant
Messenger GoldBug (  has been announced. It uses
multi-encryption (a kind of PGP secured with AES over SSL) based on
the new echo protocol. While Mega´s "Spy-proof Email" [6] and Pirate
Bay Founder´s "Hemlis Mobile Chat" [7] still play around at
crypto-parties to find the right development, the open-source project
"GoldBug" has chosen the crypto-library "Lib-Spot-On v. 0.1" (based on
The project brought out not only a secure, beautiful and easy to use
messenger, but also a new peer protocol behind it: The Echo Protocol.
The so called "Echo" creates a peer-2-peer (p2p), respective
friend-2-friend (f2f) network, which sends every (strong encrypted)
data packet to everyone connected in that network to your node. When
you can decrypt the packet, it is yours and readable, if not, you
share it with all your connected neighbors. So far so simple.
Thinking other Protocols like Jabber, IRC, Torrent etc. based on the
Echo opens up a new perspective, as this new kind of Distant-Chat
currently shown in the GoldBug Chat Reference Model introduces a
detachment with IP addresses and Private/Public Encryption Keys. The
Echo Modus can be half or full: half means, to create a dedicated line
to your neighbor, and the Echo stops there: Messages are not shared in
the half modus. This creates a Web-of-Trust (friend-to-friend)-network
within a p2p network (and not vice versa), which is not detectable -
as the user defines at each node how to utilize the Echo. This creates
a new view on trust and enables a plausible deniability of having ever
utilized a Web of Trust (WoT). An important point in times of
100%-surveillance and data retention tracking over several, but stable
While for example RetroShare [8] as anonymous, decentral network is a
good practice model for a Web of Trust, in a Web of Trust with added
echo the user can disconnect from the neighbour while keeping the
trust and communication - based on the encryption-key (so called
"REPLEO") e.g. shown in the GoldBug Messenger Application. Next to
chat as well a serverless Email-System and public IRC-Chat has been
inlcuded with the GoldBug-release based on the echo protocol and
deployed by the Library Libspoton.
How the communities of other apps and protocols will evaluate, discuss
and test and maybe adopt the security features of the echo protocol,
will be shown by some next hybrid applications - and who knows, maybe
the Hemlis-Mobile application or the new secure email systems like
BitMail [9] or StartMail [10]  announced by IXQUICK will integrate the
echo as well.
WHY THE NAME:
GoldBug was the title of a short story of Edgar Allan Poe about
cryptograms in 1843. In the short story Mr. LeGrand, who was recently
bitten by a gold-colored bug, starts an adventure with two other
friends after deciphering a secret message. Poe took advantage of the
popularity of cryptography and the success of the story centers on one
such cryptogram. "The Gold-Bug" was an instant success and was the
most popular and most widely read of Poe's works during his lifetime.
It also helped to popularize cryptograms and secured writing. Even 150
Years later a still vaid approach due to the current events in this
# Instant Messenger Function: Direct Chat, Group Chat, Public Chat.
# the integrated Email Client enables encrypted communication without
the usage of a central server. You
can even email to offline-friends: other friends from you chace the
message for you until your friends
come online again.
# IPV6 Support: As IPV6 integrates the IP-Adress of the senders into
each Datapacket, you can drop this
with the Gemini-Feature of a detached communication.
# The so called Repleo-Feature based on the Echo-Protocols enables the
detachment of logged data
retention, that means Data Retention has a solution: a TTL+1 function
in an elastic network environment.
# Optional you can use furthermore the "GoldBug"-Feature, a kind of
password, a hybride-multi-encryption,
which integrates a kind of pgp with AES end to end encryption, which
offers new standards in regard to
Instant Messaging and the Agenda Setting of crypto parties.
# Hybrid, optional P2P and F2F Modi.
# Proxy Modus: Can run over Tor, 127.0.0.1. : 9150
The GoldBug logo uses the Neuland font: "Neuland is a German typeface
that was designed in 1923 by Rudolf Koch. It is often used today when
an “exotic” or “primitive” look is desired, such as the logos for the
Jurassic Park films", says Wikipedia. That has to be regarded just as
a coincidence, no one in the net community would ever have the view to
call it the Neuland Messenger or subscribe it to a person, e.g. like
Rudolf Koch.

Während heute tausende von Mitgliedrn der Stop-Watching-Us Initiative

den Globus demonstrieren, hat die EFF in Verbindung mit dem CCC
mitgeteilt, dass es ein neues Sofortnachrichtenprogramm gibt mit dem
Namen GoldBug.sf.net ( - zu Deutsch: Goldkäfer.
Neben dem Chat wird damit auch ein Email-System ohne zentralen Server
und ein öffentlicher IRC Chat vorgestellt mit Multi-Verschlüsselung
durch eine Art von PGP abgesichert mit den Verschlüsselungsstandards
AES über SSL. Das neue Protokoll, das dieses umsetzt, wird "Echo"

ebenso auch in Deutschland angewandt wird.
Während die Regierungen kraftlos sind in bezug die jeweils
außländischen Agenturen davon abzuhalten, die Daten der
Internet-Leitungen abzugreifen und ihre Bürger entsprechend zu
schützen, sind die End-Nutzer auf sich selbst gestellt, ihre
Kommunikation zu verschlüsseln und für ihre Menschen- und Grundrechte
auf Privatheit aufzustehen.Tausende von Facebook [4] und Twitter [5]
Mitglieder erklärten, am (letzten) Samstag, 27. Juli, in den Straßen
von vielen dezentralen Städten demonstrieren zu wollen.Ebenso an
diesem Datum wurde die erste Veröffentlichung des Sicheren
Sofortnachrichten Programms /
INstant Messengers Golbug ( bekannt gegeben. Es
nutzt eine Multi-Verschlüsselung (eine Art PGP mit zusätzlichem AES
und SSL Standard) basierend auf dem neuen Echo-Protokol.
Während für das "abhörsichere Email" von Mega [6] oder dem mobilen
"Hemlis Chat" [7] des TPB Gründers immer noch auf
Verschlüsselungsparties nach dem richtigen Entwicklungsansatz gesucht
wird, hat das quelloffene Project "GoldBug" die
Verschlüpsselungs-Bibliothek "Lib-Spot-On v. 0.1" (basierend auf
libGcrypt) ausgewählt.
Das Projet brachte nicht nur einen sicheren, schönen und einfach zu
nutzenden Chat Messenger heraus, sondern auch ein neues Peer-Protokol
dahinter: Das Echo-Protokol. Das sogenannte "Echo" erstellt ein
peer-zu-peer (p2p), respektive ein freund-zu-freund (f2f) netzwerk,
welches jedes (stark verschlüsselte) Datenpaket an jeden der
vorhandenen Kontaktknoten senden. Wenn das Datenpacket entschlüsselt
werden kann, ist es Deins, und es ist lesbar, wenn nicht, wird es
weiterhin mit  allen verbundenen Netzwerkknoten geteilt. Soweit so
Andere Protokolle insbesondere der Kommuikation wie Jabber, IRC,
Torrent etc neu zu denken basierend auf dem Echo eröffnet ganz neue
Perspektiven, als dass diese neue Art einer Distanz-Kommunikation
derzeit  gezeigt in dem Forschungs- und Entwicklungsmodell Gold Bug
Chat eine neues Beziehungsgefüge von IP  Adressen und
privaten-öffentlichen Schlüsseln vorstellt. Der Echo-Modus kann halb
oder voll sein: Halb bedeutet, eine direkte Verbindung mit dem
Nachbarn herzustelen und das Echo stoppt dann auch dort: Nachrichten
werden nicht weiter geteilt in dem Halb-Modus. Somit wird ein
Vertrauensgeflecht, ein Web of Trust (WoT) inmitten eines
Peer-zu-Peer-Netzwerkes erstellt (und gerade nicht umgekehrt), das
nicht erkennbar ist, weil der Nutzer selbst definiert an jedem
Knotenpunkt, we er das Echo einsetzen möchte. Das ermöglicht eine neue
Sichtweise auf Vertrauen im Interner und eröffnet auch eine Plausible
Abstreitbarkeit ein Vertrauensnetzwerk (WoT) jemals eingesetzt zu
haben. Das kann ein bedeutender Punkt in Zeiten von
100-Prozent-Überwachung der Netzwerkkommunikation und der
Vorratsdatenspeicherung selbst über mehrer, aber stablile
Während beispielsweise RetroShare [8] als anonymes und dezentrales
Netzwerk ein gutes Anwenderbeispiel für ein Vertrauensnetzwerk (Web of
Trust) ist, kann der Nutzer jedoch in einem Web of Trust mit
hinzugefügtem Echo sich vom Nachbarn abmelden, während die
Vertrauens-Signatur und die Kommunikatiosnfähigkeit erhalten bleibt -
basieren auf dem Verschlüsselungs-Code (so genanntes "Repleo") wie es
beispielsweise in der Anwendung GoldBug Messenger genutz wird.
Neben dem Chat is tauch ein dezentrales, severloses Email System und
ein öffentlicher IRC CHat in dem GoldBug Release integriert - ebenso
basierend auf dem Echo Protokol, das von der Bibliothel Lib-Spot-On
umgesetzt wird.
Wie nun die Netzgemeinden von anderen Applikationen und Protokollen
die Sicherheitsmerkmale und das Echo protokoll evaluieren,
diskutieren, testen und möglicherweise auch übernehmen, wir durch ggf.
entstehende Hybrid Applikationen gezeigt werden können. Und wer weiss,
möglicherweise werden die Hemlis-Mobilanwendung oder die neuen
sicheren Emailsysteme wie BitMail [9] oder StartMail [10], angekündigt
durch IXQUICK, das Echo ebenso integrieren.
WARUM DER NAME:

neulich von einem gold-farbenen Käfer gebissen wurde, ein Abenteuer

Der Dichter Poe hat die Popularität von Verschlüsselung damals schon
verhergesehen und der Erfolg der Kurzgeschichte basiert auf der
Entschlüsselung eines solchen Kryptogramms. "Der GoldKäfer" war ein
sofortiger Erfolg and das am meisten populäre und von vielen
Bevölkerngsschichten gelesene Werk von Edgar Allan Poe während seiner
gesamten Lebenszeit. Es halt ebenso geholfen, die Verwendung von
Kryptogrammen und das Schreiben mit Verschlüsselungstechniken populär
zu machen. Auch 150 Jahre später ein gültoger Anspruch in Anbetracht
der derzeitigen Ereignisse in dieser Zeit.

send you the raw PCM stream from the DSP. Then you could
run FFT etc on it and make some much faster/accurate

Unmemorable node address?, quit crying and make use of your
local address book. Doesn't have plugins for current clients?,
so what, write some and use it if you're dumb enough to mix

The only real problem that still needs solved is scalability...
what p2p node lookup systems are out there that will handle
a messaging world's population worth of nodes [billions] and
their keys and tertiary data? If you can do that, you should
be able to get some anon transport over the p2p for free.
Anyway, p2p messaging and anonymous transports have
all been dreamed up by others before. But now is the
time to actually abandon traditional email and just do it.
If you build it, they will come.

Pace... a dump may not always be useful unless you are certain it would
be a complete broadside resulting in the ship sinking. If there is even a 1%
chance of that not happening, then you've shown and blown your entire wad
and the opponent will take that remaining chance and spin their way out.
Further, memory is short. So sustained pressure over time can at times
work better. Unless of course you're up against risk of not being able to
in fact sustain things. Though I'd agree, once a round is fired off its scope
and transparency should be better than the 'journalistic interpretation', and
passing to the opponent for comment/censure first, and silly redactions later
revealed to be unneeded or face saving, that we've seen to date.
The more general question is: does the instant, unannounced and unrepentant
full disclosure model that is common with single software products today
work with much more complex systems such as governance and politics.
WL initially tried that but seems now for whatever reasons to have shifted
to the model firstly quoted above. Can merely being a bigger rock star than
your opponent result in similar sinking.

This is cjdns. Last I checked (and will again) I'm pretty sure they
were using an IPv6 address scheme that would conflict with
other projects using proper private space. So if say you wanted
to run an interface for each project and run/access/route
them all at once, you can't. Yes, less than 128bits
(say a /48) is pretty weak... but when you can't interoperate [1]
that leaves something to be said for each project to develop an
address layer so you can. There certainly won't ever be more
than 2^48 projects or 2^80 users.
The undernets are getting bigger and having more projects.
They might want to be thinking about interop beforehand.
Otherwise, even though the tech under the hood might
be different, to the user they will appear as bunch of balkanized
communities, and a real pain to use any of them in parallel.

 FC00::/7 ------->||<----- L (locally allocated) bit

FD00::/8 1111 110.1 stuv wxyz : ---- ---- ---- ---- : ---- ---- ---- ---- /48
<---------- 40 RFC generated bits in here -------->|
The 8th MSB of the address has meaning per the RFC.
FC00::/7 - The whole of this block is reserved for [high probability]
unique local unicast addressing under some IETF guidance.
FC00::/8 - This is more or less effectively on hold pending the
outcome of its 'centrally allocated' discussion. So long as you
don't mind whatever the IETF may decide, there isn't much problem
using this block today since the local-ness of it is not in question.
Though using it in absense of further guidance can indeed cause
interop problems... see further below.
FD00::/8 - Allows you to generate your own /48's within it today.
Realworld networks don't allocate or use IPv6 addresses as crypto
identifiers like we do, so this block (mod /48) works for them.
And it works for us if we design ways to use the resulting 80 bits.
 Note: this block has apparently resulted in at least one informal
 self regulated registration body so as to prevent the unlikely
 event of a collision within 48 bits:
   (Before using their generator scripts, be sure they conform to
 RFC. You want people to be able to validate your Global ID process
 by pointing them to the RFC and your documented input data [faked
 MAC/timestamp as needed]).
With those clearnet things covered... crypto identifier interop and
routing is our own special use case to think about. When it comes
to routing the tunnel interfaces of multiple crypto nets on your
box... one crypto net (eg: CJDNS) blindly using all of FC00::/8
because they think they can get a fat 120 bits out of it *will*
conflict with other crypto nets that think and do the same thing.
And you can't route around it. That's the general problem here.
I have yet to time CJDNS's address generation speed and would welcome
someone to post some. Why? Because if generating into FC00::/8 is
quick enough now, crypto nets generating into FC00::/8 plus up to
an extra 4 fixed network bits [the aggregable 'klmn' above] would
still be tolerable at the up to 16x the current wall clock it takes.
The 'klmn' bits would then be cooperatively doled out to up to 16
crypto projects that maintain working code and are ready to begin
running a public instance. Need room for 32 projects, then lock
down 'klmno', etc. Be sure to make that choice beforehand to prevent
internal redesigns and flag days. 32 seems plenty to track whatever
the state of the art in crypto networks is.
If waiting on IETF for some formal extra bits scheme in FC00::/8
beyond today's FD00::/8 48's is a problem, and you want up to say
116 bits instead of 80... cooperate to 'self register' an 'stuv'
[above] worth of aggregable FD00::/8 (mod /48)'s and dole them out
[Aggregable space makes it easy to prevent leaking packets onto
clearnet from any/all of the projects with one filter rule.]
Another way is to allocate your own single FD00::/8 (mod /48) block
and use those 80 bits like CJDNS is constrained to use 120 bits.
 If your internal native address space slides up beyond 80, but not
 more than 120, so does your generating time to match within that
 fixed /48... to the point that it could take more than a few days
 on reasonable hardware to perhaps even yield a match beyond 93.
 If your internal native address space is larger than the already
 non-interoperable yet reasonably IETF compliant limit of 120, say
 128/256/512... then you'd want to develop your own internal
 database/DHT address mapping registry/layer between that and your
 native wide addresses. This works for arbitrary widths from 81 to
 120.
To get about 5 more bits, you can further ignore IETF, pick some
unused /3 from here, and then use a method above. Be prepared to
flag day into another range if IANA allocates the one you picked.
 Decent case, even without any of the above tricks, is that every
crypto net can still have 80 bits worth of users and native spoofing
resistance. That's quite a bit. And users can still develop in-network
service CA/certs and application level protection like https/SSH
passwords on top of things if more is needed. (SHA1 certs are 160
Best case, you generate / truncate / map internal space as needed
to get up to and beyond the roughly 115 to 120 interoperable bits
reasonably available with IPv6 space.
Today there are at least 5 different crypto networks that can use
tunnel interfaces. A lot of people would like to test/run/browse/serve
on more than one at once, as well as run their VPN's and regular
internet connections. Designing in IPv6 tunnel interfaces will make
that much easier, to the point that it could [should, will] be a
standard expectation for all crypto networks. And without giving
some thought to interoperation, you'll balkanize these communities
before they start... instead of building a strong and inclusive
ecosystem among them all. As a bonus, you can use all the IPv6
applications that exist today over these tunnels. That's a very
powerful draw. And it frees up developer time to focus on the network
itself instead of also on its shims, addons, howto's, etc.
Worst case, you skip this seamless interop and instead develop with
socks5, library hooks and transparent proxies. That limits applications
and gets very complicated and delicate when running more than one

References: <20131024105304.GO10405
Nor am I really, even to the point of stealing an unused external
IPv6/3 since it is unlikely all of them will ever be allocated. My
thoughts are more about what I outlined in the last two paragraphs...
that things like the userbase draw of existing applications, inclusive
multihosting and participation in more than one net easily at the
same time (whether general purpose IP transport, or specfic like
file storage [1])... can and do matter. The simplest way I've seen
yet that covers those areas is an internal IPv6 layer presented on
the host's tunnel interfaces. So what are some means we can make
to fit a world's population worth of users, out of much larger
crypto keyspaces, into about 115 bits?
[1] Imagine a link in a web page, file:///,
where  is just a point-to-point tunnel bound to a particular
filestore like GNUnet, ed2k, tahoe, etc.
Keeping in mind that people need to be clear when/what they are referring to:
- external addressing, used by the host/net on the public internet (IPv6, IPv4)
- internal addressing, the user facing overlay addresses (IPv6, onion, i2p, etc)
- maplayer addressing, map between crypto widths to narrower internal addressing
Why would anyone want to use IPv4 internally? It's only 32 bits,
easy to generate/spoof a crypto based address collision. And only
a handful of its tiny /8's (ie: 10/8, 16M users/nodes) could be
used on a host's tunnel interface that would not conflict with
external addressing. Further, every OS, and most applications users
want to use, are already IPv6 enabled, such that using them with
internal IPv6 addressing via the host's tunnel interface to that
is not a problem.
Please rephrase.
What allocation method, from what address space (v6, v4), and for
residence on the external or internal network? Via what interface?
DNS lookup to external or internal DNS server? And for an internal
or external site?
I do see FC00::/8 addresses returned from queries to external
nameservers. Leaking that activity externally can be unwise, so if
a DNS for internal addresses is needed it should be run internally.
Ok, so a few seconds to generate 8 matching bits (into FC00::/8)?
I think this is in reply to one of the possible means to fit within
a compatible IPv6 bit width. I think Eugens' forwarding style may
have lost me some context there :) Not sure where to place this or
how to read it.
We're used to disliking anything less than 128 bits for symmetric
(streams, message encryption, etc). But for network ID's there's
probably a reasonable case to be made for using somewhat less than
that... you should use TLS, message encryption, fingerprints and
other means over any network anyways, just in case something breaks.
For reference, the five nets I referred to are:
 cjdns, i2p (garlicat), tor (onioncat), anonet, phantom
Maybe there's a GNUnet interface in the works but I've not seen it

That's common sense before a bill is paid, or at least within a few
fully paid billing
cycles. Even beyond then, a small personal customer account in good standing
could be taken care of with a few keystrokes and a word about not keeping things
to ensure privacy, call it positive accomodation. So that's not really
in question here.
The customer asked for that by punching in VSC *57 after the last call.
And the average inter-call timeframe is likely never more than a week
before last call becomes 2nd last. So that's not in question either.
(People wrongly think VSC *67 shields them from things other than
the callee's view of their end of a plain old POTS/cell line.
Toll free numbers, programmed PBX trunks, etc are often
set up differently in this regard.)
This is an interesting policy. I'd not bet on it being a universal thing,
especially with the big regionals and with their history of billing
for everything.
The Tor relay operators field a lot of what seem to be informal inquiries,
a few subpoenas, and fewer orders and search warrants. Once Tor is explained
as having no records, they go away. In that example of a provider not keeping
records, there's not really a negative consequence other than time going
through the process of showing that there are none. That can be troubling
in some cases, but it's not really meant or directed at the provider.

IPv4 in cjdns is actually really easy, you just need a mapping table
inside of the node. Say you put in your configuration that 11.0.0.0/8
is for mapping. Cjdns will assign 11.0.0.1/8 to your TUN device then
whenever you do a DNS lookup, it grabs the next number in the sequence
and maps that to the key which is returned by the lookup. It could
also map addresses to incoming connections from previously unseen keys
allowing you to be a server too.
It just breaks p2p stuff which shares IP addresses.
This same idea could be used to map any number of different networks
into a common IPv6 (or IPv4) address space.
It's on the todo list. Not because we're trying to keep secrets or
prevent web crawlers from firing syn packets off into ISP null routes
but because the public domain system is expensive and an SPOF.
On small hardware yes, on my laptop it feels instantanious.
The IPv6 address is effectively the key fingerprint because x509 is
a mistake the world should never make again and colliding an IPv6
gives you spoofing ability as well as MiTM.
I'm going to sound like an asshole here, probably because I am.. but
every one of those systems with the exception of cjdns is heavily
geared toward anonymity, privacy, freedom and individualism. Cjdns is
designed to facilitate community and I've found the most divisive,
manipulative and egomaniacal people ever to grace the Hyperboria
community subscribed to just those values. At this point when I hear
TOR user, I think "oh shit another one" so while it's not really my
right to intentionally break valid use cases, I'm not feeling like
putting a lot of effort into making interop work.
BTW: it looks like the IPv4 mapping idea I proposed might come sooner
than I thought because Apple seems to have broken IPv6 support in Mavericks

the crypto itself, not tricks applied downstream or around it
(regardless of how wholesale, specific, successful or profitable a
given applied approach might be in the eyes of the doers or the done).
While recently novel and profitable with centralized services,
borrowing traditional certs [1] or logging the PFS session keys [2]
is vastly different from having a working "cryptanalysis" against the
long term thought to be dependable underlings such as
RSA, AES, ECC, etc.
Surely if the cooperation to achieve [1] is so tight then [2] would
be equally doable. Then again, might as well ship the plaintext

about 14.05Gsec. It's dropped by about 6.5% so far.
This bug should make for some interesting infrastructure analysis
across a variety of systems.

 covers what to do for Tor things.
For everything else on the net, fix the clients and servers you're
responsible for. Then...
You're right, there's a big gotcha in all this, users won't really know if
the services they interact with have been fixed [1] because huge swaths
of services simply don't publish what they do on their pages, they bury
it to keep quiet and shiny happy sites. Only some banks, insurers, utilities,
schools, etc will post "we're fixed" anywhere remotely prominent. So
you have to trust they did [2], which is a reasonable assumption given
regulation and liability of big institutional services. You should already have
a regular password changing/logout/session management regimen, so
inserting some extra instances of that along guesstimates of [2] should
suffice with these classes of service.
[2] Sometime during the falloff curve starting yesterday afternoon.
The real user risk is likely on mid to small services, embedded things, shared
platforms, legacy systems, services that didn't get the news, don't have
the resources or knowledge to fix, etc. Again, consider some form of
reasonable regimen.
And there are all sorts of tools and site testing services coming out
now for which a brave user might be completely warranted in using to
determine [1 above] so they know when to utilize [regimen 2].
(Far better to use a testing service or email their help desks seeking
a positive statement than risk being potentially considered an exploiter
of things you don't own.)
Partial list...
(Note, this is a TLS in process bug, so more than HTTP/S services are
This bug will no doubt trigger some thinking, analysis and change in
the services,
security, infrastructure and user communites... that's a good thing.

That would be 2+ years of amazing win on NSA part [1]. Any unlikely
impropriety would come out soon. More likely reality... opensource
people are busy and good humans and coding mistakes happen.
Hopefully the general buzz around NSA/security/crypto/decentral will
result dedicating more permanent resource to things like protocol devel
and replacements, and auditing of key underlying software code.
You really need to be asking if and how the giant for-profit corps
that use opensource for free are giving back. $50k a year donated to
fund an independant developer pool from the OSS community to sit on
the teams of your favorite code projects of choice as auditors is nothing
to a companies like that, a dream gig for the dev, a win for project, and
good company PR.
How often do you see    etc
on developer/donation lists... you need to ask those type of
 if, how, and why not.
[1] And pretty dumb of any attacker to not simply quietly watch,
analyse and exploit the committed output of any critical project...
no insertion, cost, or risk necessary to do that.

The detection would often occur with a scrub type of
routine maintenance check or automatically depending
on the system.
And unfortunately there are many critical repos that
essentially refuse to move to a revcontrol system that
employs signable hashes/merkle such that a cracked
repo or even bitrot could be detected. Often out of such
non claims [1] as workflow and effort to switch. FreeBSD
is an example of such a key repo.

Moot, the minute you drop some sat into orbit
everyone knows it's there even if they don't yet
know what it does. Some speculate at least the
US uses angled optical/radar shields to hide the
bulk of some crafts from ground/orbital view. Sounds
like a lot of game for that, especially when aerospace
industry spies could provide the same general infos.
Seems really difficult to fly and calibrate. ie: would certainly need better
than gps timing onboard each. Maybe 1km pyramid of four could
range each other well enough, no idea. As Jim referenced, membranes and
cheap ridgid multi mirror systems may be better. Remember Hubble
was scrap when launched, but given a reference image (or in its

Before, it was a subconscious unthought mode of inter conduct (if not a firmly
developed expectation) as outcome of natural limiting circumstances...
ie: it wasn't possible to recorde peoples lives, so the context or concept was
not thought among people. Just some limited and expensive gov't tax, census,
bank type systems.Then cheap computers everywhere hit and the nazis began
collecting in mass again. The new laws are a restoration of
expectation in the form of
an enforceable right, which is now necessary form to do it against the
lack of natural
limit. The laws are not even close to restoring the formal mode/expectation, and
the abuse of imbedding, collection, using and sharing without explicit
permission and
policy based release from the principal is abhorrent to the former
natural way in
which they would conduct. Society is slower than data and must exert its control
over it and its greed until it has developed to handle such thoughts.
Beyond even any reasonable 'need', phone companies maintaining *decades*
of CDR's, CC purchases, and CL *not* 'deleting' posts are all equal evils. Turns
out phone companies *gave* the metas to govt's and whoever else for whatever
use internal and external via chains of weak or strong MOU's, secrets, etc. Now
what exactly do you think content mines like CL, your mail, your facebook are
doing with your content??? Hint: much worse. It's hugely unethical to the person
and society to collect, keep this, let alone process and do whatever
with it. It's
faster than expectation. There is an inherent ethical right to respect
the society
and principal person, especially if you are faster. That includes
forgetting and not
even [ab]using them in the first place. Otherwise you are basically
stealing lunch
money from retards. That's bad.
There's also distinct differences between the service itself doing the
now very often) unexpected or contrary to 'delete' recording, and
public recording
and mining contexts, ethics, etc. Altavista was nice, but did society
really need it
grown into the GoogleMine? GeoCities --> FaceBookMine? Who will honor your
request to delete yourself from old 'non-service-made' public
geocities/usenet archives
today, from facebook archive 30yr from now? We are still slow and
stupid, particularly
in hindsight, therefore in a digital age we need now encode that
right... just as we had
been natural forgotten with time, physically moving, and new
associations before then.
And to encode not to keep... because we are too slow to make that
decision right now.

impossible remerge the blockchains, but since your local fork still has
local value, you'll sell/swap it for value in whatever the global chain is at

typically gets you the value it has in the winning country, unlike local
fiat/digital which loses drastically. Still, everything is subject to natural

It doesn't matter what a chipmaker provides and claims as truth today.
Anyone, spy or not, anywhere in the chain from design to fab could
insert anything, there are probably not enough internal control and
validation programs in place to find it. And if something untrustworthy
is sucessfully implanted or simply produced TOP SECRET approved,
who on the outside is going to find it? No one publicly open, external, and
disinterested is sampling these chips off the shelves and decapping them,
or exhausting all possible input data against expected output, or has eyes
in the fabs. Until the world has truly open fabs, you might as well assume
it's game over.
Similarly, we can't even get rid of default firmware passwords, baseband, bad

benefit greatly from being able to advertise their use of such

not have such interest/capability in house, should wish to donate

Why these 'social launches' work for crappy apps is becuase the windows
writers cater to and know the forum using, bling ridden, pop, idiot-sphere.
While cpunk writers / good apps such as might be found below have
historically shied away from that catering/knowing, there is no reason
they cannot engage it, or that they cannot partner with people that do
to enable their own social launch.
I don't agree. If you do not design for say 2bn users upfront
(as is the general subject of this thread re: nexgen global p2p solutions)
and instead target 200k or less, you will hit major roadblocks that
are very difficult to rip out and cure becuase your entire mindset
from day one was only scaling to a dreamy 200k. Mindset and failure
to think big traps projects like these, and if they somehow capture
and grow users they'll get overloaded to the point of unusability.
The best case they then embarrasingly have is to take a year
basically rewriting from scratch, or they fail and users move on.
And once a project hits unusability issues, that is a hard image to
shake... fool me once. This is a classic issue in systems history,
where better upfront design would have prevented it. The examples
are plenty, there's really no excuse anymore.
The p2p pooled anon secure model is interesting. I think MaidSecure
was the most recent thing making the rounds in this area. Maybe
FreeNet is also similar.

Probably because they don't currently have a choice. ie: afaik, there's
no good decentral/p2p fiat-BTC exchange. Localbitcoins might be
close in a way... distributed transaction locations in person... but it
has a long way to go as far as volume and price sanity in any given
area. And there seems to be some rollup of your transaction stats
to the site, possibly including your price and volume, which a great
many would not care to share. Until the commute to your local btc
trader is tolerable, and under your desired level of regulation (or not),
the big exchanges will remain the only real way to move nontrivial
amounts in/out. That's not a problem for most players, they just
want a place to play that looks stable long enough to push their
transaction of interest through, or make enough money trading to
offset the risk of trading there.
On that note, Gox is dead. Any comeback will be a private legal
matter between them and their customers/investors. If and after
that 170M or so is ever paid off, by that time other fully legitimized
and well regulated exchanges will have completely blown past and
marginalized Gox (and others tbd) into just an early memory.
Look to the US to come onboard with some *very* serious exchanges
within the next year. Wall street already sees coins as tradeable, and
banks love taking fees, holding stuff for you and pimping it out the backend.
It really just comes down to how good Bitcoin (or any given virtual currency)
is as a protocol... chain size, TPS, 51%, etc.
VC's are pure greenfield and everyone wants a piece, including Govts (even if
only by taxation). Gox isn't going to stop that, neither is any other
non protocol
meltdown or anon horsemen skirting the exchanges... the potential profits are
just too big for entites to pass up. Claim your stake today.

I think if you load Vuze with the mlDHT plugin you'll often see
150m users online.
If a DHT can scale to say 10B nodes while performing lookup on an
unknown key in say a minute or less [1], that sounds like a great start.
Are there such designs in effect? The concern is that we don't appear to
have any decentralized p2p messaging network today that is anywhere near
that large. When you ask the current big ones (BT, Tor, I2P, cjdns, etc) they
don't seem to have a scale solution, be they filesharing, transport,
messaging, etc.
[1] Perhaps reasonable latency for delivery of mail across an anonymous
transport (aka: circuit setup time, uncached) may be a few minutes or so.

There is slick, and then there is utility. I'm seeing some good utility
in a few of the listings on  . When it comes
getting utility done, it's not to hard to introduce (even firmly) people
into using utilities. Slick helps, but it's not required, and will come in
time. Everyone throws up BS about adoption and thus nothing ever
gets built, or even researched, screw that, I say build it and see.
I also question a few of those listings.
I agree with this hardware path, especially for the subject of p2p
secure messaging.
I think voip is currently not a user priority on devices with a cell
stack because that
stack is already activated and paid for. With good apps and wider access to free
wifi in particular, encrypted voip should take off. Or we will see
more use of cell
based IP plans. Another twist is going out of voiceband to get the key material
of your peer, then with the more open phones out there, grab the cell
on them and stuff your encrypted voice over that if voip doesn't work
at that moment.
But that's way off topic to p2p secure messaging... at least until
that hardware path
allows for p2p secure .
Right... I think not everything has to run in RAM... we have a few GiB
to store the network state in, as a sliding tradeoff for reconnection speed
when switching them back on. CPU is another available slider. So is
network rate/transfer limits.
I gather Africa does a lot of things with simple text messaging on
simple non-I/Android/MS/Unix phones. What is their path for phone tech
advancement, and when?
Is it reasonable to expect to truly need to develop for more than the
'West' as a userbase? Keep in mind the West now probably includes
China and many other places, so we're looking at more than 1B nodes
anyways. We probably mean 'Western class' of phones. And by the
time a p2p secure messaging platform the subject of this thread is
deployed in a handful of years, that class will be much more widespread.
So perhaps natural convergence of this software and hardware will occur.
Yes there are West/first vs. second/third disparities, if everyone
waited we wouldn't have what 'western' tools we have today.
There are folks in the west that need them too, even to work on
solving those disparities, so it is not much of an argument to expect
to limit develop only for western class HW.
See what you can build for intel/amd CPU's.
See what you can fit in ARM, snapdragon, android, etc.
ie: I2P has it's main repo in .i2p and some anon developers.
I don't see bootstrapping into the net via peers as 'unwanted',
they are your trusted real world friends for the most part. What
your app does after that with the network db it learns from that
doesn't necessarily need to involve your friend anymore.
What don't they want? A little less initial security for a day while
the app crunches and sorts things out? Possibly selecting a trust chain
other than that introduced to them by their friend? Reading the
public consensus on that?
It sounds like the BS adoption issue people like to claim in
order to not build anything.
Granny learned to surf the net, so Johnny can learn to encrypt.

There may be advantage to the security of your own traffic if you
also handle the traffic of others.
Economically, it's probably not right to expect 'free' transport in
such a system. Though perhaps at minimum you should be
expected to provide benefit to the network an equivalent of what you
consume, including the extended cost to the net of your consumption.
ie: in a multi-hop network your impact is not just over your own interface.
And in an anonymous network it's most assuredly not right to
force users to pay using non-anonymous payment methods.
Though they may optionally do so if they wish.
How close is the research on these issues to being codeable
into actual p2p transports (whether anonymous (preferred) or not)?

it's moot. Or unless they can pull unannounced random samples
and decap and analyse them, it's moot. That's why I've previously
suggested people get together to making hardware RNG's out of
discrete components... you don't have those worries then.
I agree with the softcore loadable fpga and probe points ideas, they're
good things. But in general, once you exceed a certain number of
presupplied closed source and relatively unauditable gates [1], you
should consider yourself potentially and generally fucked... and
start taking a serious defense in depth approach.
[1] Let's call it the number required to perform dumb leaks or take
pseudo intelligent actions against you. The current lineup from
Intel/AMD certainly fall in this category.  As would quite a few
lesser things... ARM, phones, cards, etc... firmware things.
Does it not scare you that the next PC you're about to buy

to honor magic packets? Look at AMD's new CPU's coming

For any app really, ditto on success, especially if there's a windows port.
Various approaches usually work:
- "I need someone to test with"
- "This is what I use a) your thing doesn't work for me b) this is better or
 c) tough"
- Etc
If you're willing to put in the time to show people, they will use it.
There are people reporting that voice over Tor hidden services
is at least barely to actually useable, there is a lot of variance
though. Streaming low bitrate music is no problem. Latency is
about a second, setup can be a few+ seconds. Again, variance rules.
Regarding attacks, low latency and bulk data streams present
different surfaces. It would be interesting to see an anonymous
network that fills the entire banwidth you allocate to your node
with chaff during the time in which you do not otherwise need it.
The anonbib probably has something to say about that.
The subject is regarding large scale P2P secure messaging,(email)
 not particularly the subthread of voice / general data transport..
I can see some advantage to using/modifying/merging ideas from

The pace is ok, it keeps up the pressure. The real question is,
is what remains? More of this same stuff we all knew was happening
anyways? Or is there more deeper stuff we only questioned but
shrugged off due to the hardness/fantasy of it all?
- decryption of aes? cracked rsa?
- automatic and global translation to stored text of all voice calls?
- gratuitous unwarranted passing of crimetips to LEA?
- fundamental metadata knowledge of all persons/associations?
- political puppetstringing?
I suggest the answer lies in budget analysis... the possibilities
within a well spent budget. Or a seriously conscientious leaker at
the top who is yet to come... since so far Snowden seems limited
to confirming lower level obviousness.

And interesting idea to be sure. Though while you could easily enough
verifiy the data/leaker and arrange payment semantics, there does
not at this moment seem to exists a suitably anonymous pay system
for even $100kUSD other than a briefcase in the woods, bitcoin appears
to be balance trackable at that level and it's useless to the leaker if
they can't deposit or draw on it.

- Consider instead deploying NNTP via Diablo with a list of current

I mean ethically someone should do it. But unless a filtering
node agrees to forward messages filtered from its own list through
its backend and out to all the other nodes for them
to make their own choices, there will be holes... unless
a user cross posts. A node committed to carrying all
user posted messages should advertise itself as such.
Similarly for carrying all backend received messages.

I think because you as leak recipient could defraud the leaker of their
efforts by unwrapping and placing your own identity stamp on the leak,
the leaker would have to publish the leak themselves with their own ID
stamp into say a new time-secure blockchain dedicated to leaking.
Then the payment board would examine the chain for prior leaks
of the same material and award payment to the first such leaker.
If for some reason the leaker cannot leak to the chain, such as with
inconceivably digitizable/transferable materiel, they must obviously
establish the traditional trust mechanisms with their receiving/publishing
partner who will enter leaker's leak and ID in such chain as proxy.
Deciding what a leak is worth could be done in the usual AP
fashion by donating to classes of leaks.
Blockchain systems already have some N of M signature
requirements to release funds.
Zerocoin or some anon payment is still needed. And payment to
leakers ID would show up for verification in that system.

Hi sorry for barging in, but with all of the projects now based around
decentralisation, I thought a common place to exchange ideas would be good.
I have created a subreddit
 as a place for as many
projects to collaborate and share experiences,
research and general comments.
I am hoping to make this an open environment for discussion and technical
debate, but not a place of project wars. This is essential and to that end
I would like to engage with you and have you all sign up to the subreddit.
I believe as we recodnise more projects then at least one person from each
project should be a moderator. This should add stability and ensure that
each project is protected as they all have their own path to follow. I
suggest each project puts forward an admin and I will add them immediately.
I believe there is enough of a push now to decentralise services and
working together to achieve all of our goals can only be a good thing.
Below is the sidebar text as it stands, this is all open for debate.
This is a reddit of logic and not emotion, please base all debate on logic.
We do not want project wars here, so no vim/emacs type debate between
projects. Keep focussed and logical if at all possible.
Whilst people will prefer one project over another, the point of this
subreddit is to find the technically best solutions to the miriad of issues
and share technology and discussion between projects. Advertising is not a
goal of this subreddit, although new information about projects is
Submissions that are mostly about some other server based solutions belong
Please avoid repetition — /r/decentralisedinternet is a subreddit devoted
to new information and discussion about decentralisation of the Internet.
New projects are welcome to announce themselves via this reddit, but after
those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be
re-posted. New news will be accepted. Aside from new project announcements,
those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's
self-serve advertising system.
Projects so far (please request to be added by posting a link to your
project, if it is upvoted and agreed by redditors to be accepted it will be
added here)
I am sending this message to each of the projects mentioned and any others
that should be included as we progress.

How would this be any different than what the guardian (and

As opposed to the user flashing Android-ROM-OS into any

This question shouldn't imply such products aren't needed.

Not so much, ie: one must still evaluate them too.
Pretty products, onesheets, and test vectors. Yes, they're nice and
do help in overall movement towards an all encrypted world. They're
worth recommending. However, caveat trust and whatever other issues
to the recommendee. This applies equally to opensource.
Seeing mail providers basically advertise 'you can trust us' to
their end users (with whatever backing reasons they have (which btw
are typically as full of holes as your typical privacy policy))...
that's what should give people pause to think carefully.
This, re: proton... which would you rather hear, and which do you hear?
- Warning: We detected a breach that injected snake oil into your browser.
- Warning: We can inject snake oil into into your browser at will.
Any provider who tells you they offer an email service in which
they can make your email trustably secure for you, regardless of
how they claim to do it, is a liar. Period. You are the trust root,
only you can secure your email.
So those who want better will need to use provider independant
encryption tools. And the best you'll ever get with them under [1]
is encrypting everything but the 'envelope to' (which you must
expose for delivery), and the authenticated 'envelope from' (which
they, being the centralized rulers they are, will require). More
self help tools...
Any fixes on centralized clearnet 'email', beyond everyone using
self help tools, will always have these trust issues now. As with
Banks/Paypal vs Bitcoin, remove the delegation of trust to the
central provider... by removing the central provider from the equation.

You Don't Have to be the NSA to Break Tor: Deanonymizing Users on a Budget
Alexander Volynkin / Michael McCord
Looking for the IP address of a Tor user? Not a problem. Trying to
uncover the location of a Hidden Service? Done. We know because we
tested it, in the wild...
In this talk, we demonstrate how the distributed nature, combined with
newly discovered shortcomings in design and implementation of the Tor
network, can be abused to break Tor anonymity. In our analysis, we've
discovered that a persistent adversary with a handful of powerful
servers and a couple gigabit links can de-anonymize hundreds of
thousands Tor clients and thousands of hidden services within a couple
of months. The total investment cost? Just under $3,000. During this
talk, we will quickly cover the nature, feasibility, and limitations
of possible attacks, and then dive into dozens of successful
real-world de-anonymization case studies, ranging from attribution of
botnet command and control servers, to drug-trading sites, to users of
kiddie porn places. The presentation will conclude with lessons
learned and our thoughts on the future of security of distributed
anonymity networks.

where it is only natural to seek intervention.
Then there are the cases worthy of every possible protection outlined
Therein lies the dilemma. What do you do?

do not exist... said spies and their actors are likely to monitor

Right, in the likely context of the subject exploit, I referred only to
the similar .onion/.i2p hidden constructs that available for users.
Binding to and using them is a bit different of course but it all works.
And the .i2p's are generally as 'efficient' (speedy) in use regarding
initial connect, latency and bandwidth, if not better. (A lot of filesharing
is on i2p.) Bootstrapping into the net does take a while though. And
of course as with any other darknet you should run a 'non-exit' relay
to help out.
i2p does have 'exits' you can compare to tor as well.
Anyone can run an exit. But users have first find one
on a wiki list or somesuch, and then manually configure
their i2p to use it. Consider it like a bolt on proxy. Last
I checked one comes preconfigured but as such expect
it to be far overloaded. No reason there can't be many,
there just aren't.

Legally, in most western / sane countries, there are provider/carrier/isp
exceptions exits fall into such that running exits (tor/i2p/vpn/proxies) is not
a problem... Tor has about 1000 of them. And if you follow torproject.org,

and funding efforts. eff.org runs PR challenges. This all applies to I2P and

Yes, I've always felt the level of interop among crypto darknets is
arbitrarily far less than ideal. Everybody seems to want to make their
own user protocol for umm, say, the simple act of sending a message.
And with all these different vertical darknet silos, you'll never be able to
seamlessly cross message your friends on some other nets you also happen
to be running. Then even if you got a pluggable *user* protocol for messaging,
surfing, storage ironed out and made, you still have the problem of *backend*
dest (and src) addressing. ie: There are at least four, maybe six nets I know of
that can present an IPv6 tunnel interface to the user. Making it dead simple
to securely route all your traffic into the darknet[s], or the entire
set of darknets
based on CIDR block addressing into them. But no, right now they overlap and
conflict :( And without IPv6, they use different native addressing schemes.
This begs for a serious sitdown conference amongst darknets to see what
better cooperative user and backend interfaces might be possible. Or at
least create one grand DHT based middleware addressing shim between
them and the user (and preferably one that presents IPv6 tun interface, you
know... because every app on the planet can speak that these days.
Which is a big adoption win.)
Mmm, pies, me hungry.

@_date: 2014-07-07 00:24:23
@_author: grarpamp 
@_subject: Interoperating the DarkNets [was: Tox] 
There's nothing centralized about it at all. You generate your own
rfc4193 IPv6/48. It's random so still check with other projects
to be 100% sure before going live, and there's even an open
registry to help with that.
The problem is when people like cjdns blindly stake the other whole
available even wider fc00::/8 as their own without thinking about interop
(well if you actually need the bits that is, but with accepted crypto
starting at 128 / 2048, 120 bits is no more valid width than 80. and with
the DHT below this native width limitation is moot).
The reason to declare IPv6 on a tun interface on your host
is so users can run whatever IPv6 enabled app users want
to run, on whatever darknet, right now, today. Darknet projects
should be coding good darknets, not duplicating existing writing
user facing apps for them (browser's, mua's, login's, fileshare's,
git's, wiki's, webserver's, etc).
An IPv6/48 is big enough to hold every user on every darknet simultaneously.
But yes, we cannot arbitrate control central the map from IPv6 addr to user
(truly, their darknet internal wide address / PKI key).
So DHT... darknet user picks random IPv6 addr as their own key,
adds in each of their darknet addresses with sigs over it [1] as values.
Now you have the needed interop map. You need to label and rewrite packets
to/from each darknet with this scheme, but that is easy part.
[1] To be flexible in binding, one darknet per port/range, or one per whole IP.
The DHT could hosted over any darknet, or it's own special darknet.
The problem with IP stack replacements to something really wide (eg: 512)
is you then have to produce a library and beg all the above user apps to link it
and handle it... not going to happen. Or write your own apps which takes the
whole variety of apps/life on clearnet and crushes it into your few
apps... not fun.
So replacement = limitation and poor adoption.

References: ---------- Forwarded message ----------
I can answer this:
1.  The IP addresses can be connected to an ISP and physical address
should the need arise.  It allows the NSA to "rewind the tape" so to
speak.  That is why there has been a push for data retention at ISPs.
Given that in the EU governments are seeking 2 years, it would
indicate that the platform can rewind internet activity for at least
that long.
2.  Tor is a communications platform, the NSA's job is to monitor
communications and intercept military planning that effects either
itself or its partners.  Secure global communications and computing is
now a commodity, whereas it was mainly a state-only capability.  Thus,
the average user is now coming up against intelligence agencies,
rather than state actors alone.  Leaving blind spots would be
dangerous to national security as it provides opportunities for
planning and coordination.  So, there is a legitimate case here and no
one denies it.  The real problem is that in the absence of a genuine
international threat and by that I mean someone on the scale of
Russia/China, these systems are being directed against groups with
limited capabilities.  Those groups are now being defined as national
security threats to justify budgets and to filter money into
particular black projects.  Revelations by Snowden and other releases
are merely a distraction to where the money is really going.
   Did no one notice trillions are being drained from the US economy
into some unidentified military project for the last decade or more???
It would seem to indicate that there is a Manhatten-style project underway.

Here's another class of provider and browser based non solutions...
There's a thread of this subject ongoing that acknowledges Email
can't really be fixed against the issues of the day... and discusses
other possible messaging designs towards a next gen solution...
The goal is likely one or both of these over an anonymous P2P network...
o  direct delivery to your recipients online node.
o  stored delivery to same (push or pull, only exposes destination).

All currencies and property exhibit volatility, scandal and theft.
It is a laugh to suggest otherwise, especially for anything 'new'.
And of course there will be new digital currency 'companies'. Let's
just call them what they will be, large central banks and govt's.
But none of them will have the property that their currency is not
under their control. Other than the obivous head start bitcoin has
in the digital currency game, that is what bitcoin offers
philosophically... freedom from control. No company can or will
offer that with their currency. And people are choosing freedom to
the tune of roughly $100M moved per day [1] when they could just
as easily use the current centralized digital currencies of
CC/ACH/wire. If bitcoin itself ends up not scaling well enough, or
being anonymous enough, or resistant enough to centralization...
another decentral digital currency will do better and take its place.
The only real question is, will a decentralized currency such as
bitcoin beat the centralizers in the race to global adoption by the
masses? And similarly to reach point of no return adoption before
centralizers realize it's too late to say no?
You really don't want to let big central things emerge (here
$trillion-dollar corps), bad things always happen with that.

Thing is, having seen the possibilities, people actually *want*
this freedom from central control, in a bad way, and they're willing
to act to get it. They also realize that if they, and the entire
community, don't act together to maintain the decentralization they
have... then it's over. That's why ghash.io (the largest pool) just
announced that they will not exceed 40%. Down from 55% to 32% now...
And why BTC isn't exactly rushing to support regulation...
Further, again, since people want decentral, if some large entity
does manage a BTC takeover, no problem... all users ok with that
will stay with the now central coin, and the free decentral people
will just exchange their coin (or fork) into whatever is the current
decentral coin. Repeat as needed.
So far BTC has a good history of actively cooperating to avoiding
central. Excepting mining companies (ie: the 10% corps, who have
made similar self limiting statements), the VC money seems to stay
out of the coin itself and is being placed in surrounding service
ventures... exchanges, banking, processors, wallets, retail.
In the end years from now, maybe only three coin will remain...
- A World central
- A State central
- A World decentral/anon/etc
With all of them being roughly similar in acceptance, volatility, etc.
People spend more than a dollar to post mail, or drive to the store.
It will be a long time before the ASIC and electric cost to clear
a transaction (at whatever network transaction demand rate) exceeds
palatability, if ever. Pick a projected compute power, node count,
required tx rate (at 100% utilization) and then basically figure
gigawatt and gigahash dollars per tx.
A guesstimate with current state and data?
- Installing double current hashrate to take 50+% costs about $130M
  in retail hardware alone. Less for a real deployment.
- About $10k/hr to power it. More for cooling, support, bandwidth.
- About $0.40/tx-current spread over a year. Much less if running
  at 100% tx rate capacity. Up to twice more due to doubling current
  hashrate.
Right now that amount is being covered by coin mining profit.
The future taper of coin production vs then current market value
of coin vs tx fees will be interesting. And ASIC platforms have yet
to reach performance plateau. The base tx cost is cost of the coin
algorithm to support a given required tx rate. That seems quite
low. The race (difficulty) to claim the tx fee profit drives it up.
Yet the hardware market is open, yielding a level playing field.
So as long as the required tx rate can be met affordably within the
algorithm, this is unlikely to be an issue.
Cost of tx rates also naturally moderate the proportion of users
amongst each payment system. It remains to be seen, once all the
various BTC costs are fully optimized, if BTC can handle tx rates
approaching the credit cards. Even if not, that doesn't keep it
from utility at its own natural rate limit.
Some seriously big players don't seem to have any problem with BTC...
Well, since BTC is nothing but experimental scrap metal, please be
sure to send yours (and that of all your central fiat loving friends)
off for proper recycling to my recycle bin here...
Liked or learned something from the links, etc? Tips go here, I'll

No better way to naysay BTC than to break the crypto and wash
everyone out. $Billions gone, and a permanent seat in the research
hall of fame ;-) (BTW, where are the BTC insurance companies...)
I'd agree that actual market float outstanding is thin right now.
Yet different from purely propping things up, speculation is all
about assessing future value and making moves accordingly today...
Not so fast! Yes, Dell accepts dollars (subject to whatever BTC
holdback they, like Overstock, may be specifying). However obtaining
those dollars is totally dependant on Coinbase's ability to convert
BTC to dollars on exchange or privately. And Coinbase is surely
nowhere near whole enough from commissions to be able to back their
contracts against any significant outstanding float in a long price
dive situation. Therefore Dell *is* in the BTC game before dollars
on these sales, regardless of the denomination they're booking. So
is everyone else who 'accepts' BTC. Dell and others are large
companies, with well paid accountants and lawyers... it takes more
than whim of 'marketing BS' for them to put a BTC sticker on their
The BTC market has been in a fairly steady log uptrend over the
long term. The 'collapses' people speak of are, in that context,
spikes returning to normal. All new markets and properties undergo
price discovery. It's a continual process. Ever watch the NYSE,
it's volatile too.
There is no 'useful for this or useful for that' concerning things
riding on top of this tech... the underlying model, including the
social contract aspects, either works for all uses, or for none.
It's either broken or it's not.
Neither will credit/debit cards. Nor is your fiat paper of choice
'real money' either, it's just called money by default. (Probably
because the next default, real property, is hard to fit in your
pocket.) Digital currencies will, like 'money', operate in the layer
above real property.
Again, here's the recycle bin for your trash, this time I'll even
waive the recycling fee... ;)
50% is not a magical binary breakpoint, it merely permits more
influence as the share moves along the scale from 50% to 100%.
Right now, the $130M plus expenses (or $27M plus for ghash) that
is needed to reach 50% seems to not be worth it to anyone.
Who is graphing the cost-to-50%? And the cost-to-50% to market cap,
volume, and quantity ratios? Those would be interesting and important
graphs to watch.
$130M is nothing to someone who wants to own a currency. So why
hasn't it happened to BTC yet? Perhaps because the value of BTC
owes a lot to its decentralization. If so, and you take that away,
you're risking your own value before you start. And risking an
exodus fork.
Just as easy as it was to add BTC to Dell's checkout in N days time,
adding another currency is easy if yours (or your takeover) fails,
or customers continue to demand a decentral one.
And you're not going to win a takeover anyways because no one will
tolerate you blocking their transactions... no entity survives
having 50, 40, 30 percent of its users in abject protest against
theft, loss of value and service, and principle. Among other things,
you'd be prosecuted, sued, DDoS'd off the net, badmouthed, and
forked against.
Probably better to start your own digital currency and put $115M
into marketing and $15M into central hardware.
That only applies to mining 'companies'. Mining 'pools' derive
their share from the users who elect to use them. Of course a
pool could become a company. And a company could uphold the
social contract.
The Ghash was a remarkable social contract event by both shedding
users and users leaving. It's happened before, and each time it
does it underscores the importance of the contract to the currency
to everyone involved.
In the end, if anyone succeeds in taking/making any private/centralized
coin, there will be some users who follow it, and some people who
reject it in favor of other decentral coin.
Digital banking and transacting has been done for decades. Banks
could have made ACH/Wire compellingly attractive to users and the
marketplace. But they waited, and didn't, and lost the chance...
just like telcos lost the internet and music lost itself.
As with those things, crypto in the 90's and overlay networks today,
what is really being tested with BTC along with the tech, are meta
concepts such as freedom, regulation, where value is stored, law,
At the moment it would be quite hard to say decentral digital
currency is failing or holds little long term prospect.

under. It's a huge undertaking and responsibility in its own right.

Though it's more consumer oriented and the price is lower, blackphone isn't
the first to market a crypto phone to the public, these guys have been around
for many years... lately doing a GSM+Android combo as well...
And a couple companies claim to be building 'open' hardware phones,
I'd call them 'more/mostly' open. I forget their links at the moment :(

with this and tech like ZRTP, that's not even close to OPIE strength.

Maybe the option is there, I don't know yet. No doubt because these sorts
of companies bury all their real tech docs deep behind glitzy Web3.0 splash,
(points finger at blackphone.ch, ahem!)
I don't much care what they've done with opensource Android and things
riding on top of it, since anyone like Guardian can do that as a project.
Blackphone does have some Cell, Server, VoIP, etc stacks deployed
to complement the phone, that's handy and takes $capital. But what I
really want to know is:
- What phone make and model is it based on?
- About how, if at all, they've managed to open (or claim to
certify, reverse engineer, substitute open replacements, or somehow control)
the closed Android blobs and/or the closed phone firmware/hardware below
that??? That's would be the real progress, and worth buying as an integrated
system (I'd definitely buy that progress), but only if it was open in turn.
Does Blackphone accept BTC? I was begging for BTC the other day... :)
Thanks Bill, we'll need more than a few quality reviews of the security
model of the system as a whole.
If this phone and company does well, maybe it will use its power to leverage
that progress as time goes on, but it only matters if it's open.
And for where you need Cell based voice/data connectivity, I'd like to see them
offer a GSM hotspot wifi tether so you don't have to trust the cell baseband
(now unused, or even physically neutered) on your device (phone/pad/tablet)

It's about entrenching good crypto and its benefits *before* govt's can
react without needing to expend extra effort to rip out said entrenchment.
HD was better and opened spectrum, so people didn't rise against buying
new TV's, especially for smaller cheaper LED vs CRT. Health was better
and cars rusty, so people didn't rise against new cars, especially for cheaper
and more fuel economy. Gov't wins when they offer something people want.
The sooner you entrench something they want... crypto protection
from 'the spies'... the sooner gov't will have a very hard time taking it away.
Crypto is like candy to a world of newspawn Snowden babies... hard to pull
once given. So start giving it away...
Take those cowards you know out to the gun range and show them how to fix
their house and cars. Man them up out of irrational fear and into confidence.
People are pumped full of FUD, hard to combat directly, so tricky end
arounds are needed. Anonymously pamphlet your workplace with EFF.
Apparently Zuckerberg, Saverin, Moskovitz, Sandberg and others
of Jewish heritage behind Facebook have forgotten what collecting,
processing and benefiting from data on users can turn into. As ones
who should know, why are they collecting and not out there 'explaining'?
Again, hard to combat. Make it real for them... everything they do
is collected, stored, watched... convos, pics, mail, a life of their
expressed thoughts... without their consent, forever. Count the
cameras on your ride home from work, the junkmail in your post,
the ads in your browser.
It's also relatively easy to stop by local party offices and ask 'Hey,
what are you guys doing about all this spying stuff?'. Presenting
issues in person is hard to ignore, I've had good experiences with
local official types.

Yes, it's nice and helps. It just needs to come with better
disclaimers. Otherwise companies/providers that remain
silent on their threat models do nothing but tarnish themselves
amongst those that know better. Such silence could backfire.
Whether they get used as an bad example in security presentations,
or something happens to one or more of their users they effectively
sold (or gave) snakeoil to.
Please provide link to your source that breaks down Email use by
HTTP, IMAP/SMTP and legacy POP. And their crypted versions.
The problem is the context of where in the network you got the
software from, and who you're using it with, and who you're trying
to keep in the dark.
If your first install or subsequent updates are from your mail,
storage, or comms central service provider, etc... that's a major
and direct conflict of your security interests. It's why Matasano
objects.  You don't download your OS from your adversary.
On the other hand, if you obtain and use the code independantly
of your provider, or the code creates a disinterested decentral
P2P infrastructure (Freenet, etc)... then you're in a much better
position. You've inserted a layer of independance/abstraction.
Similar to installing gnupg to use independantly...
You should be able to download openpgp.js from the code distribution
point, read any audits, check the sig, locally load and permanently
lock it into your browser from your plugins directory. And then
mail providers should develop a consistant RFC based API from which
you interact with them so you don't have to download whatever blob
they claim you need.
Directly trusting codeloading works fine for internal corporate
environments. But it's a really bad idea elsewhere.

This is because they are in fear of the people. So they feel the
need to mass surveil them in order to stay on top of potential
issues with their position that could lead to, ultimately, revolt.
Why are they in fear? Because they are doing wrong, if not for their
own individual selves, for the collective power at the top.
Any true servant of the people will have no such fear or need because
no one can point any finger at them... they serve, they do not rule.
You will never, ever, under any circumstance, vote for (in the US)
either of the two parties so long as they continually play into an
effective one party system. You will only vote for other third and
further parties, and rarely choose incumbents among such, unless
they are shown to serve the people. You will not fail to vote such
thirds unless there is no third candidate. A vote for Dem/Rep (in
US) is an obviously wasted vote supporting maintenance of power,
the effective 'one party' system... not servants.
It is exactly right. Only reason media focus wins is because sheep
eyeballs believe and flock to it. It is self reinforcing. Media is
especially guilty of choosing to profiteer from these sheep rather
than pursue real journalism. You must break that bullshit feedback

My references to scale were not intended to be about...
bulk bandwidth across such networks (for example, right
now, I2P and Tor are doing well enough to see very low
quality video between their hidden nodes if you get a lucky
path, and well enough for moving large files around in non
realtime). ie: the nodes have bandwidth available.
But about scaling the node (user) count from millions to billions...
No device (or its ethernet) will be able to manage a 10 billion
entry DHT with a handful of keys, addresses and flags per entry.
But if you break it up into some many clusters/hiers/roles of smaller
DHT's, each knowing how to route queries, sort, and pass entries
around, it might work. Once you've assembled your multihop
path from querying the DHT for nodes, actual data transfer
rates should remain similar. (Provided the network clients
know to reserve bandwidth mod the network average hop count,
by throttling the users usage at their own node).
It would be nice to check some numbers on this for the list.
Is there a wiki or paper repository that discusses plausibly
reachable DHT sizes, time needed for DHT ops to resolve,
and management schemes for such clusters/hiers/roles?
[aside: This everyone online, big DHT, end-to-end reachable
model mirrors the internet today as a general purpose tool.
Perhaps sufficient for many rather sensitive tasks.
When the purpose is narrowed, other models may apply.
For messaging (as is the subject), everyone still needs a
unique address. And since msg delivery/pickup must be
reliable, there is a question of redundancy needed to avoid
random msg loss. Which may turn you away from store-forward,
mixes, and unconscious central storage, etc... towards everyone
online, contact them directly over a path or retry later.
Today it seems that general purpose may be better researched
and easier than more exotic means. Question is, is GP sufficient,
after applying any recent GP tech post I2P and Tor's designs?
ie: Some say timing attacks may be mitigated by fixed packet
lengths and adding chaff over links as cover.]

I generally meant TLS hides the multitude of headers, but
headers themselves are not today encrypted to the recipient
or to the network, so they end up sitting in the open... and
their SMTP style and purpose totally unnecessary to a new
transport network.
Yes of course... the minimum necessary for delivery is the
destination address. If the network design ends up yielding
control protocol returned from the network to the sender, the
source must be present. Your network client node handles
decrypting the content to find enclosed within (or to configurably
affix if missing) any further traditional headers if needed by your
local messaging agent, routing stack, etc. Such content may
contain the unique address key of your correspondant, be signed
by them, etc.
Dest: unique destination address key
Optional network metadata: ...
Src: optional unique src address key if control feedback
Content: encrypted blob
'Optional network metadata' may be needed depending on
the network design, full of sigs, routing, storage or other data.
But it most certainly won't be SMTP headers as we know them
today. And will be encrypted to shield from all but the most
minimum of nodes possible.
Further, if the network ends up being general purpose
bidirectional, such that you might run IP traffic/apps over it,
the source address key will obviously be required in
either the Src or Content contexts.

Faraday cages concept really depend on the freqs they are designed
to inhibit, pressure, sound, radio, optic, etc. Given wide enough freqs,
one cage does not service all.
A fridge has plastec and magnetic gaskets, over maybe 2cm variant
gap, so not a complete EM seal (at whichever specifical freqs).
And grounding issue. But good at human sound deading.
Microwave door shield is closer to cell phone freq shield.
If you cannot simply remove the battery preferably, that is.

Biometrics suck for privacy and security because you're
often giving them a sample of the raw biodata itself... your picture,
palmprint, dna. They have that and can use it against you or
lose custody and you yourself have been compromised with no
own fault of yours and cannot go back.
Now if you give it to your own machine which makes and
presents a hash to others, you are safer there. But no more secure
than former.
Two factors of 'know' and 'have' with threat of sanction usually
works fine. ie: HOTP, secureid, key+pin, your own biohash, etc.
Be careful what you wish for, some holes have value.

A lot of the issue is why *your* records, metadata, and maybe even full
take, are on government disks if *you* have not been the subject of a specific
warrant against you under the Fourth. That's not supposed to happen
(ie: it's illegal, regardless of whatever postprocessing, access, expiry
and oversight rules there may be) and that bothers people, a lot...
the slippery slope, grandness, secrecy, and handwavy assuredness of it all.
People want genuine discovery on these programs so they can make the call.
The govt likes to wave examples of specific cases, but seem to be
debunked by media security analysts as not particularly constituting
the claimed 'immediate and grave danger[s] to the national security"
[docket 244 page 6], such that ordinary quality investigations and
specific warrants might suffice. People want to see the cases and
define immediate and grave for themselves.
People don't seem to mind vacuuming up overseas background
noise as spy-vs-spy gamesmanship, but question how that may
now be resulting in various things like drone killings without public
trials. People wonder what they did, and where it could lead if unchecked.
Then the stingrays, parallel construction, Lavabits and much more.

Though that's an event you *really* want to avoid. Thus for

And how many dollars on hardware and power would an

maybe an amount that might be hard to keep quiet.
There are verifiable and agreed upon checkpoints...
Agreed there is a lot of trust, crazy trust, and the adoption in actual business
using it (not simply user2user beer and pizza trade), is a bit amazing.
So far it's held up. Try to break it or game it, mathematically or
operationally, huge recognition for anyone who does.
Those with personal money (not mined) in their hoards are on their own risk
decision on that, at least until say the ten year mark and the laws prove out.
Others have mined or can mine, or invest, to recover/recoup their entry
which makes it free for them.
The rest seem to get in, buy a pizza, and get out (perhaps wisely).

Yes, a relay IP can expect all manner of blockage, or none at all,
even for non-exit relays [which is dumb, but true]. It depends on
what the far end is doing. Best practice is to run the relay
on its own IP.

References: ---------- Forwarded message ----------
In case people are interested in a project of a friend of mine, Joel
Lehtonen (aka Zouppen) is on a fast track to implementing Bitcoin
transaction and blockchain broadcast over the airwaves. Everything is
half done, so he might need some help; at the same time that half-done
then also includes half the funding, half the code, and half the
negotiation with the Finnish monopoly DVB-T provider, Digita, to
actually broadcast the stuff to a couple of million strong. Even if
it's just a test, it's already well on its way to happening in a month
or so; so it will.
If people are willing to chip in, especially with funding, deeper code
knowhow, radio-fu, and the rest of the useful ones, do contact him, or
me (aka decoy), on FB/G+/IRCNet/freenode, or better yet join
 on the latter.
In particular we don't have any idea of how to push transactions back
towards the network over any sort of cheap-to-free, preferably
universal radio path. If you do, even in a quilted fashion, we'd
really like to know. And since the only ones who're really allowed to
experiment on them waves today are hams, those of you who possess that
qualification, your input is in the direst of needs.
Finally, I hope this isn't too much off topic; it *is* about spreading
a cryptocurrency and finding its optimal OTA protocols, after all. Not
perhaps the most usual stuff on-list nowadays...but certainly the kind
of across-the-board architectural stuff the list started out with, in
the crypto days of yonder. I hope it fits.

space for racks, aisles, power, network at say 50% better density than industry

$10M in drives at consumer pricing will get you a raw 177PB, or 236PB at double
the space and power. Or $1B for 17EB. Budget is an issue.
Give it a shot on paper, best estimate wins...
[1] If all you care about is storage, you plug drives into tiny custom
storage fabric
asics and present giant block devices at the end of each row or room, not into
bulky servers. Commodity CPU's have 64bit address space, ZFS covers that.

@_subject: Intersection of Projects [Illegal Activity As Security and Anonymity 
In a long thread starting here:
If I recall correctly, this subthread was about people getting
shuttered because their Apache etc was insecure, and that
somehow creating [paid] hosting services for them within
relatively general purpose nets like Tor was the solution. News:
those services are still open to the same exploits, and still use
the same HS mechanism that has potential whitepaper
exploits too. Further, he [or whoever OP'd the subthread] did
not define what they meant by "distributed' or "removing 'visibility'
of one end".
Stepping back from the above specific, and re: Freenet...
I think someone else mentioned or hinted at layering to
enhance things. Yes, interestingly you can in fact
layer some systems upon general anonymous transports,
especially if they offer IP transport. ie: Use Tor/I2P
with onioncat, cjdns, phantom... layer tahoe+lafs,
freenet, messaging, Bitcoin, torrent, etc on top. Gnunet,
MaidSafe and others I missed probably fit somewhere too.
Mash it up however you like. (Excepting where they did not
coordinate their collision spaces, such as in IPv6 addressing).
It tends to be complex, slow and fraught with timeouts,
but some combinations work ok.
At some point you must regularly sit back from your own
project or usage and take time to categorize all the systems
out there, what they are good and bad at, and then admit
to yourself (or as a user) whether layering is valid... or more
importantly, whether you should merge forces with other projects
to, up to and including, scrapping old and writing new projects
that provide both user utility and resistance against attacks
of interest. Or is your usage the best it can be? Can you in fact
create an all in one tool? Or can you create a well defined
intersection amongst projects / tools such that their layered sum
equals coverage against all attack classes, or the subset you're
interested in or subject to. And can you create a similar intersection
matrix for the services offered (web, messaging, storage) by such
networks. Can you coordinate research, structure and promote
projects in such a way as to cooperatively and formally provide a
complete set of resistance and services?

Cross coin exchanges are guaranteed free of crypto taint, so that's better.
Cross coin may not require KYC due to not touching fiat, so that's better.
But you still have two of the same risks as with same chain exchanges...
- logs held by the exchanger
- watching the amounts in/out. Cross coin is a bit better here for swaps
of casual consumer amounts due to the addition of the variable exchange

Which ubiquity, in the curious case of Tor/I2P, appears to be holding
up reasonably well so far. That is to say, who can state a case
where a weakness in those systems (documented, or not) was exploited
publicly to jail someone? Tor people seem to say it's possible, and
the four horsemen have been operating in these nets for many years.
Yet we're not seeing any canaries dropping in public. Why?
And there's mountains of lesser [computer/finance] crime, filesharing,
etc on these nets, with no sign of those actors being disrupted
Let's move to leaks, a civil/criminal matter. That's the one thing
that has had perhaps even zero first person appearance on .onion/.i2p.
Why not? (Discounting docs from criminal hacks above, submission
portals to third party publishers, mirrors, etc.)
What if the docs that say, places like Cryptome, have had to pull
due to threat of legal/ToS action... were hosted and told by the
leaker/collator themselves on these nets?
Who will carry the future gilded staffs of Cryptome, full-disclosure,
WL, etc? And more importantly, where?
What if a new set of Top Secret Snowden-like docs were hosted on
tor/i2p? What if they had fewer silly redactions, or more sources

not yet seen?
Are these nets only suited to street crime? Is offloading through
the media the only suitable/safe place for high crime and politic?
If not already present on these nets (some classes noted above),
and thus far apparently immune (perhaps foolishly so), then what
exactly are the needed test cases that will start producing not
just dead canaries, but public record of what killed them?

Have you not been following the weaknesses intrinsic
to SMTP discussions?
Yes, they are hidden in TLS transport on the wire.
No, they are not hidden in core or on disk at
the intermediate and final message transport
nodes. That's bad.
We want all human relevant plaintext content, such pesky
headers included, to be hidden from observation by anyone
other than us (at our origination or final receipt nodes).
There is no oh boy in that sensible new design.
Have you ever heard of MLAT, extradition, interpol, public
and private cooperation, dealings, and other such things? And
maybe you simply do not trust any 'country' with carriage of your
insistent plaintext. There is no such 'solved' with that.
I believe it could. Even if requiring super aggregating
nodes of some sort. Layers of service of the whole
DHT space. More research is surely required.
 p2p is for techead kids like you, not for the masses.
We are talking messaging, not bulk data.
However, once you have the nodes scalable to millions

bulk data among a select few along their path metrics.

not)... either
remotely by cooperative agreements (or simply giving), or your own local

a) basically start street protesting to change global law and practice

b) defend in depth and bury all user messaging within secure p2p darknet
overlay networks where only Alice and Bob are parties to the plaintext content.
And the code you run to get on it is developed and audited by separate
groups, be they well known nyms on such nets, or real world.
Any proposed messaging system that is centralized, not pay anonymous,
not open, works by you giving up key material you shouldn't, or you needing

Back to p2p... your recipient, and your peers are all
independent businesses. Look out in your city, other than
you and Alice who both are 'up' by definition of wanting
to talk some method, you could fail many people/nodes/businesses
and still route a p2p message through. It's hard to
eval trust of a single business or %'s of nodes. Yet
just like all the millions of torrenters, your odds of
the majority of the nodes [which have real IP's hard
to fake in the disparate millions] being on your side are
probably better with p2p than whether one single brick
and mortar business is screwing you over, or forced to
to so.
Business centralization, vanity, monetization, etc to run
the lava*'s, proton's and so on is counter to some
of the problems they attempt to solve. Their real benefit is often
adding research to the educational pile of debunked non-solutions
to such problems. A natural selection process of sorts.

All true. And it's not as if the penalty, even if considered criminal,
would be anything more than trivial [1]. Further, if you are a business
owner who is judged against
- personally, you are your own employer so nobody can fire you.
- business license pulled, liquidate and sell it back to yourself.
A jury would likely "you're here for publishing this? Lol, go home."
The actual risk seems rather low. I'd do it just for the fame.

You either got the letter or you didn't. Whatever means you
let that be known doesn't matter, the observed result has
exactly the same meaning as holding it up on the street would.
The degree of redaction is up to you. But if your object

Try expanding the idea to a more formal or longer paper
with diagrams.
Your suggested adversaries can and will run a 'receiver' to get the
contents. They are in the 'receiver's ISP and use netflow or other means
to trace back the spoofed packets. It's basic network administration.
Unless sender A is aware that final delivery was made to Z (or knows
the net is reliable), broadcast models will fail to deliver reliably due
to being clogged out of the links or aging. To be reliable, broadcast
needs control, knowledge, or maybe unavailably large time/space.
Packet sizes must also be the same throughout the network. And
must be detectably immutable at each layer of link and onion-ish
path encapsulation, or be dropped. ~1500 mtu minus layers = data
Related... redundancy to the destination could serve as chaff. Yet with
underlying privacy, unclear on the need for redundancy (as chaff), unless
the redundancy solves full path (or node) reliability issues. Otherwise
'control as chaff' seems more valuable.

I would never use this unless you were actually censored from
accessing facebook via clearnet. All it will do is serve to officially
tell facebook that you are a tor user that FB can then further
discriminate against as a class in the future once they start to
lock down clearnet against exit nodes, travelers, etc or whatever
their scheme is or will be.
Remember, FB's official policy is still:
- Real Names required
- Phone Numbers / ID required
- DOB required
- Gender required
- Email required
- Etc required
- Users are the product that is being mined and sold and shared.
Such non optional elements, and choices, powers and rights
removed from the user, are in direct opposition to the principles
of Tor and anonymity. Normally support for onion/i2p is good thing,
but when still backed by crap like this it's largely meaningless.

References:  <545A64A0.8030300
Attack surface on a well adminned relay comes down to three things:
- Network stack itself (kernel)
- Daemon software itself (tor + remote admin)
- Their respective use of other kernel/library/shell provided resources.
I might suggest the current proportion of Windows to Linux is
roughly ideal. This is primarily because, all other things set equal
at 'minimal' (= tor + remote admin), good adminning, and good
control of corporate secrets (or moles)... Windows still has one
huge strategic weakness at that point... the magic packet.
It's the whole binary vs. opensource argument. So essentially,
the correct ratio of the two might be the odds you place that
a binary OS has a magic packet. Today's node count shows
73% to opensource platforms. I'd suspect 73% is about where
a lot of analysts might bet on Windows being magical, whether
by/for the NSA, or any other reason or source.
(Remember this...
 That was just from running 'strings'. Good luck trolling all of
Windows with a disassembler... a nice fat payoff if you do. And
the number of disassembling vs. opensource auditors is probably
even more heavily skewed. And Windows is 'trusted' by buyers,
nor can you replicate their binaries from any 'source code sharing
agreements'. Then it's Patch Tuesday again... so it could be no
one has or ever will disassemble audit it. So odds end up being
pitched instead. And for many applications, that's good enough.)
The real problem below is the 96% allocation of opensource to
Linux and 4% to Other opensource. That's something that should
be fixed. For these purposes, it doesn't matter which BSD/Other you
pick... once you get the security odds there back towards
say 50:50 Linux:Other, then you can debate userland and relative
security amongst them all you want.
Here's some links to get you started, including two other
main branches of the Unix Kernel family tree at the bottom...
5939 Linux
1591 Windows

   4 Bitrig    2 GNU/kFreeBSD    2 DragonFly    0 Illumos (OpenSolaris)    0 Minix Official metrics...
Someone should really do an analysis of platform vs. exit bandwidth
as well. Anyone?
Also, isn't there some project out there that is counting the historical
number of kernel bugs+severity per OS over time?

This excessive Linux dominance in both node count and
bandwidth really should be balanced out, like why not?
I'd expect if some of the big relays switch to any other OS
that would flatten out the bandwidth part pretty easily. You'd
have to check say the top 10, 25, 50 or so relays to see to
what extent they are part of this mess, I'm sure it's similar.

@_subject: Node Operators Web Of Trust 
Is it not time to establish a node operator web of trust?
Look at all the nodes out there with or without 'contact' info,
do you really know who runs them? Have you talked with
them? What are their motivations? Are they your friends?
Do you know where they work, such as you see them every day
stocking grocery store, or in some building with a badge on it?
Does their story jive? Are they active in the community/spaces
we are? Etc. This is huge potential problem.
NOWoT participation is optional, it is of course infiltratable,
and what it proves may be arguable, but it seems a necessary
thing to try as a test of that and to develop a good model.
Many operators know each other in person. And the node
density per geographic region supports getting out to meet
operators even if only for the sole purpose of attesting 'I met
this blob of flesh who proved ownership of node[s] x'.
That's a big start, even against the sybil agents they'd surely
send out to meet you.
Many know exactly who the other is in the active community
such that they can attest at that level. And so on down the
line of different classes of trust that may be developed
and asserted over each claimed operator.
Assuming a NOWoT that actually says something can
be established, is traffic then routable by the user over nodes
via trust metrics in addition to the usual metrics and randomness?
WoT's are an ancient subject... now what are the possibilities and
issues when asserting them over physical nodes, not just over
virtual nodes such as an email address found in your pubkey?
And what about identities that exist only anonymously yet
can prove control over various unique resources?
If such WoT's cannot be proven to have non-value, then it seems
worth doing.
This doesn't just apply to Tor, but to any node based system.

the way things are looking worldwide, GPA's seem to be the real

and laws be damned... well, the old ways are over, it's the Wild West.
Filling all the network links with chaff could be a way to protect users
(maybe they were just loading the homepage over and over), but they
could still bounce all the IP's to look for servers.
There may be an oppurtunity for the operators of anonymous services
to band together and monitor themselves or each other for bounces
simply to confirm if bounce tests are infact happening against all such
service participants, high data/connection rate ones, services based
on age of identity key, or any other such class they are able to identify.
And they'd have to characterize true bounces from network reachability
This is hard to defend against. Store-and-forward... maybe.
Decentralized p2p/blockchain... more likely, at least for market-like
things that could be modeled as transaction-listing-like things.
Another way to test is for someone to use perfect opsec (wifi, tor,
bitcoin, etc), and actually run a number of illegal sites and see what
happens. Then consider some sites may be allowed to live even if
actionable, or simply won't be taken down if there are no real world
links to act on.
Tor had one recent whitepaper that claimed to have actually located
hidden services (real or test) within a minor budget and timeframe by
abusing nothing other than the Tor network itself. Right? Has anyone
replicated that work?
People need to be analysing these court documents very carefully to see
what bits of knowledge can be drawn from them. That's a project in itself
and EFF/Tor wiki would be a good home to begin cataloging them all
and making notes of such things in each case.
It's pretty obvious something is going on besides opsec, especially
with the quotes in the news. Question is, what is it?
Tests need done, knowledge needs found, capabilities need catalogued,
and defenses need developed. Step by step, scientific method.

IAB Statement on Internet Confidentiality
In 1996, the IAB and IESG recognized that the growth of the Internet
depended on users having confidence that the network would protect
their private information.  RFC 1984 documented this need.  Since that
time, we have seen evidence that the capabilities and activities of
attackers are greater and more pervasive than previously known.  The
IAB now believes it is important for protocol designers, developers,
and operators to make encryption the norm for Internet traffic.
Encryption should be authenticated where possible, but even protocols
providing confidentiality without authentication are useful in the
face of pervasive surveillance as described in RFC 7258.
Newly designed protocols should prefer encryption to cleartext operation.
There may be exceptions to this default, but it is important to
recognize that protocols do not operate in isolation.  Information
leaked by one protocol can be made part of a more substantial body of
information by cross-correlation of traffic observation.  There are
protocols which may as a result require encryption on the Internet
even when it would not be a requirement for that protocol operating in
We recommend that encryption be deployed throughout the protocol stack
since there is not a single place within the stack where all kinds of
communication can be protected.
The IAB urges protocol designers to design for confidential operation
by default.  We strongly encourage developers to include encryption in
their implementations, and to make them encrypted by default.  We
similarly encourage network and service operators to deploy encryption
where it is not yet deployed, and we urge firewall policy
administrators to permit encrypted traffic.
We believe that each of these changes will help restore the trust
users must have in the Internet.  We acknowledge that this will take
time and trouble, though we believe recent successes in content
delivery networks, messaging, and Internet application deployments
demonstrate the feasibility of this migration.  We also acknowledge
that many network operations activities today, from traffic management
and intrusion detection to spam prevention and policy enforcement,
assume access to cleartext payload.  For many of these activities
there are no solutions yet, but the IAB will work with those affected
to foster development of new approaches for these activities which
allow us to move to an Internet where traffic is confidential by

The only thing you'll ever get from space is whatever whoever
owns the satnet wants you to see. The idea that people are just
going to be able to bounce their own unregulated networks
off transponders for free as in freedom is ridiculous unless
you own your cube and all means of its control. Hint: not
going to happen, let alone at any reasonable price point.
If its that freedom you want today, go spend $100 and wire/wifi
your residence to two of your neighbors and run CJDNS, etc on top
of it. Repeat until you cover the globe in an individually segment
owned meshnet, anonymized and encrypted on top for censorship
resistance. Use whichever layer you want therein, the clear or
anon one.
It is the strict individual ownership and private peering of individual sized
components of the network that keeps you free from all realistic
physical/legal controls. And self-reinforcing deployment of encryption
and anonymity that gives you freedom to share whatever data and
thoughts you want with others and others with you... beyond just what
you and your two neighbors might like chatting about.
The greater percent of any network you cede to groupthink, groupbuy,
and groupcontrol the less freedom you have. Launching and running
shit in space involves a lot of freedom robbing group*.
Homework: Do the math on number of residences / land parcels
in your country. See how $100 in wire/wifi and router ports from each
of them compares to the cost for each to truly own their own sat and
sat link. Figure in launches, electricity, replacement, adversary
HERF/laser attacks on the sats, millions of individual sat nodes
colliding with stuff, network redundancy achieved, stability and
speed of local wire in the ground, etc. Even at $500 to $1000 worth
of onetime or amortized costs I'd bet wire/wifi guerrilla nets still win.

At lot of the issue is that currently the OS map on phones looks like:
'Android/green' hardware = Google OS, 'iWhatever/white' hardware = Apple OS.
The solution is to remove the '=' ties between the two. Already we are
seeing porting efforts by BSD and Linux kernels to the ARM
and other hardware commonly found in phones and other less than
PC form factors. And hardware integrators are making more open-friendly
devices where they can, perhaps someday up to and including baseband.
Eventually, other than some binary driver blobs, you'll probably see a full
Unix running on them in 5 years, driven by 'just because it's cool', and to
get out from under the complete hardware to appstore, bottom to top,
stacks we're stuck with today.
With the nexus6 and the droid sdk, you could strip out a big chunk
of useless google stuff and make your own rom. Even without venturing
into unix porting efforts. Guardianproject and some other customization
efforts seem to be doing just that.
'Appstores' are nothing more than the commercial side of things
with all the typical historical lock ins. Eventually opensource
provides alternatives and demand leverage to open up some
cracks as happened with PC's and Microsoft. Those cracks build.

Funny you should say that; it seems Australia Post has come clean:
(You may need to be a subscriber)
Australia Post data shows more mail being accessed by government agencies
Australia Post disclosed confidential information to law enforcement,
security and other government agencies more than 10,000 times in 2013-14,
an increase of 25 per cent over the past four years.
According to statistics released by the postal corporation, "specially
protected" information, which includes information about letters and
parcels and other private client information was provided to government
agencies by Australia Post on 5635 occasions – more than twice the number
four years ago.
Federal government investigators accessing specially protected information
include the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission,
the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, the Australian
Customs Service, the Australian Taxation Office, Centrelink, Medicare and
the Child Support Agency.
Victorian and Queensland police as well as the NSW Crime Commission and
the Western Australian Corruption and Crime Commission also received such
private information.
Postal information that is not "specially protected", including names and
addresses on the outside of letters and parcels, was disclosed by
Australia Post on another 4367 occasions.
Government agencies accessing this postal "metadata" include the
Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian
Communications and Media Authority, and the federal departments of
agriculture, environment, defence, foreign affairs and trade, health and
State police and anti-corruption agencies, state revenue offices, consumer
affairs, workplace and environmental regulators as well as the RSPCA also
accessed the information.
An Australia Post spokesperson said the corporation only discloses
information to authorised agencies "under a law of the Commonwealth, or
for the enforcement of criminal law, or for enforcement of a law imposing
a pecuniary penalty, or the protection of the public revenue".
The spokesperson emphasised information is disclosed "only after the
'authorised agency' requesting the information from us establishes that
the information is reasonably required for … lawful purposes".
The total of 10,002 disclosures in 2013-14 was 5 per cent higher than in
the previous year, despite a 4.8 per cent decline in the volume of letters
delivered by Australia Post.
Only 19 disclosures of postal information were made to the Australian
Security Intelligence Organisation.  This figure for 2013-14 is down from
31 disclosures in the previous year and is the lowest in a decade.
Australia Post's statistics show ASIO's access to postal information
peaked in 2005-06 and 2006-07, with 117 and 226 disclosures respectively,
a period that covered major counter-terrorism investigations in Victoria
and New South Wales.
ASIO must obtain a warrant from the Attorney-General to seek any postal
information from Australia Post.  Although the 2013-14 disclosure
statistics precede the recent surge in counter-terrorism operations
focused on supporters of the so-called Islamic State, the figures do
suggest that ASIO's investigations target quite small numbers of people.
However, the Australia Post statistics also show that despite consistent
declines in mail volume, confidential postal information is increasingly
accessed by police, by government agencies enforcing laws that impose
financial penalties and for "the protection of the public revenue".

Just like AdBlockPlus, user's mail clients should be shipped and
extensible with simple local filtering spam/virus/malware processing
engines. Users, having no such simple plugin tools available to them
in early days, complained of spam which drove provider/anti filtering
more than providers separate ability to handle the traffic load did. All
the anti position did for providers was shift their cost from disk spool
storing it to cpu rejecting it. And users got censorship tools developed
and deployed against them in return. Failure!
Users need to do their own filtering and encrypt now.

Indeed. Many seem to be missing the hidden extension / meaning
of whitewashed quasi-political statements like those of the IAB
that are now coming from various entities, and it's a point that
needs made directly, at least regarding one aspect of things...
It's not anymore about 'should encrypt by default'... continuing
to give yourselves the lazy fallback excuse of oppurtunistic crypto
and waiting for someone else to do it. It's not anymore about asking
your masters for permission to do what is not regulated today, or
giving them seats and chance to muddle / dictate your protocols
before they're developed / deployed.
It's about 'must encrypt' and turning plaintext completely off NOW!
It's about telling all the lazy oppurtunistic fiber tapping passive
surveillors, (who are today breaking fundamental inalienable human
rights not just regulations, and without asking first)... to FUCK
OFF! This is not a time to play nice and compromise... it's war,
one which they started against you. So deploy your crypto now, far
and wide, and faster than the enemy can respond. Mass internet
entrenchment has a winning history against subsequent fiat.
We won the first crypto war, now it's time to win the second one.
Flip the crypto switch, from off to on. Don't ask, don't tell, just
do it.
Mail providers and web services... turn plaintext off!
Banks, schools, utilities, blogs, socialnets, OS distributions,
user applications... the public facing, used by the public, whole
lot of you... everyone, everywhere... just turn plaintext off!
All plaintext transports over the internet... OFF!
Even decentralized P2P applications such as chat / filesharing apps
that wish no model using CA certs, can still enforce crypto by
skipping cert checking under self-signed certs or using [EC]DHE
style crypto session negotiation.
There's no lack of capability or support among all these internet
facing services and apps used by the general public anymore. Every
OS / library can deal with TLS 1.0+ or key negotiation for that.
And you don't need some grand crypto scheme that you all love to
pontificate in endless circles about right now either. Just turn
the damn plaintext OFF and tell everyone to go read the FAQ and
update their end if they can't connect. Then worry about your pie
in the sky later. It doesn't have to be perfect, all you need to
do is shift the game from taking cheap passive global wire surveillance
up the ass, to requiring more expensive targeted active attacks.
Simply turning off the plaintext does that, it's a huge win!
And while you're at it, set up a nonprofit CA foundation to issue
free certs and get it added to the Mozilla and MS cert stores
specifically for the purpose of accomplishing 'plaintext off'. CA's
are useless profiteers who couldn't authenticate their own ass as
customers anyways, and cert stores are uselessly bloated with both
them and enemy entities... so just give the damn certs away to
anyone who can publish a proof of ownership flag / TLS cert on the
forward reference to their own services... simply to quiet self-signed
warnings. Nice to see something like this just dropped as I write:
Pick July 4 2015 as the day to disable plaintext, since by then
everything worth anything will support TLS 1.2 / good negotiation
parameters, and it's a fitting meme.
And if you don't like that flag, hoist another one...
Now quit reading, making excuses and waiting... the enemy will just
stomp all over your flag. Go get started on your code, updates and
crypto configs... you've got a flag day to make.

References: <008cbe7468ef38777d2e2addf83b21b2.squirrel
Maybe the centralization issue should revolve around things other
than such two sided math proofs should neither side win...
1) There's expectation that some TPO-like entity will blackball
known bad nodes, a non-human distributed authority (be it DHT or
otherwise) doesn't permit that. Which is actually a non issue because
users can simply subscribe to whichever trusted blackball source
they desire. Onionland may still be providing some of these bad
node listing services.
AFAIK, that's the only real service Tor authorities provide today.
The rest is under the hood of the *only protocol* in (3) below.
2) The network simply cannot run if some or all of the nine authorities
are taken offline. Even users passing around their descriptors file
and continuing to run can't be done because the code doesn't support
that. So the network dies. Tor right now is like the centralized
'illegal' filesharing traffic model ie: Napster... every single
central sharing service that had human figureheads in control of
the network got shutdown. When the heat comes to Tor, it will get
shut down if its fixed human authorities can't stand the heat.
There are not an endless number of figureheads, but there are an
endless number of users. For which, as with DHT torrenting and
bitcoin, the responsibility for those networks is so distributed
that it's pointless to try taking them down. Phantom, I2P, and a
number of others are also distributed and seem to be working fine
as well.
3) Bitcoin and torrent also work as protoools because all users
agree that the protocol is *the one and only true protocol*, they
are at risk if they change, so a self maintaining gravity is both
present and natural. If there are forks, they don't last because
users figure it out and abandon them or at least stop until the
network figures itself out. This is why Tor bootstrapping isn't an
issue either... you're unlikely to bootstrap yourself into a bogus
network for very long, especially if you do reasonable research in
the network socialnet beforehand.
Self host the repository, ship with signed recent descriptor and
bad nodes subscription lists, bootstrap into that, and let network
dynamics and user choice run from there. At least that's the model
of some other networks.
Tor is probably central today as a result of inheriting a central
design model. Thereafter if not remaining so from simple gravity
then from either:
A) waiting for a chance to stand up with its authorities for the
   sake of proving out fundamental privacy/speech geopolitics.
B) putting them in the position of standing as test fodder.
C) trending nefarious.
Tor is a US entity which has certain benefits and weaknesses. And
the international support structure of (A) should be analyzed and
stress tested to determine its strength bfore relying on it. All
the while noting and incorporating similarities to the WL, Snowden,
filesharing, and crypto battles, etc.
Curiously, whenever all is said, it's still useful to have both
centralized and decentralized networks surviving under pressure.
Yet is centralization actually *required*, say to achieve something
specific beyond that, or which cannot be modeled decentrally with
some decision elements pushed out to the user.

Following on some related and technical comments...
While my analogy and definition of security may not have been best
suited, nor is this reply, the point remains that there is nothing
special here for you as a corp. Anything you say that LE can provide
for *you* with honeypots can also be sourced internally or from the
open market and your subsequent call to LE to mop up upon discovery
of badness therein.
What is unique here is that LE will be classifying things learned
from the HP's as gov't secrets. That's a hard problem. As opposed
to telling you all of what you need to know to secure your own net
under internal policies and vendor contracts that you would otherwise
remain in control of.
Further, technically, parking an HP on your net only tells you about
what happens regarding via that HP, nothing else. And since you
must distrust this other party HP [1], then all you've got is a
cracked HP outside your trust zone, no different than any other box
on the internet. It's limited vantage point and bogus security
metrics argument.
Sure, the US gov't might be able, on the whole from this, to correlate
and expose more nation-state/international crime sources against
the US and embarrass some foreign diplomats. That's always a good
and fun thing [2]. And the services of LE are indeed valuable.
However do not make the mistake of thinking that *you yourself*
will benefit *directly* from this program, that's not what it's
designed for or capable of. In fact, you will be left out as dog
food in case of 'national security priorities/secrets' arise.
The responsibility for securing your net still rests with you and
you alone as always. The better way to be more secure is to ignore
these silly sales schemes and look same effort at your own processes,
weaknesses, code, OS/hardware, compartmentalization, etc. Maybe
<=1% of that ends up being the use of HP's. Improve those own things
overall and you'll be far better off.
Last, what if one day *you* _need_ to use a freedom network and
they've sybil'd up their nodes *against you*? Be careful what you
ask for and invite into your home in the name of security, you might
just get it... applied against you in time of need.
Well then the solution there is clear... get rid of the MS boxes,
and those who sold and administer them. Like HP's, nothing special
about MS either.
Time limited I maybe not reply further.
[1] For reasons of both sanity and legal insufficiency of any
indemnity offered.
[2] Note that some megacorps follow their own allegience... claiming
the flag of whichever market suits them best at the moment.

Biryukov, Khovratovich, Pustogarov
Bitcoin is a digital currency which relies on a distributed set of
miners to mint coins and on a peer-to-peer network to broadcast
transactions. The identities of Bitcoin users are hidden behind
pseudonyms (public keys) which are recommended to be changed
frequently in order to increase transaction unlinkability.
We present an efficient method to deanonymize Bitcoin users, which
allows to link user pseudonyms to the IP addresses where the
transactions are generated. Our techniques work for the most common
and the most challenging scenario when users are behind NATs or
firewalls of their ISPs. They allow to link transactions of a user
behind a NAT and to distinguish connections and transactions of
different users behind the same NAT. We also show that a natural
countermeasure of using Tor or other anonymity services can be cut-off
by abusing anti-DoS countermeasures of the bitcoin network. Our
attacks require only a few machines and have been experimentally
verified. We propose several countermeasures to mitigate these new

Though it is perhaps helpful for them to make such classification here:
a) that's in regards largely to exports, not internal use
b) the phrase is 'arms shall not', not 'things on our list shall not', so
any such classification list is irrelevent. Ignoring the NBC / large arms
debate, crypto is clearly small arms in this context and thus shall not
be infringed.
Crypto is also clearly necessary to the security of a free people, and thus
of/to the state being of the people. And shy of state failure requiring its use
in support of revolt, crypto is clearly a defensive arm primarily against
encroachment. In current example, mass surveillance, lack of individualized
warrant, abuse of process, abuse of implied right to privacy, of the 1st, 4th
and 5th, etc.
It would certainly be an interesting use/case/argument to explore and test.

This is why I still ask this, as being able to use the 'cell voice'
or 'cell data/IP net' from an isolated standoff would be useful. Unlike
using the common 'WiFi internet' provided by cell hotspot/tether, I've
not yet found any protocol, app or hardware for extending either of
those two cell network services (voice/data) from the infected baseband
device to your isolated secure laptop/pad.
Though cell voice/dialing may not actually matter as, unless you
needed to do it remotely, you'd just pick up the infected
baseband device and use it for only that purpose. Same
for cell data. (Cell data is not SMS, fyi).
Note this is not the same as using say your home
internet or coffee shop wifi to subscribe some voip trunk
over the internet. It is directly using/hooking to the cell
carriers voice or data channel, like your GSM phone does.
I was referring strictly to baseband threat, not caring about what
is attempted over the WiFi/BT/NFC/audio gap from the baseband
infected device to the user's relatively more secure/isolated laptop/pad.

It seems reasonable to presume Greenwald has a copy of the entire cache.

Same for if Snowden himself retained his own copies, whether in

statements by such parties about who has what or does what as
always true, especially by the main actor[s]. Regardless of how
true any statements on other topics may be.
Before those questions may be answered the world may need to wait
for Snowden's own legal status to be resolves.. such as permanent
Russian or other citizenship and shield from remote US prosecution,
or return to US and resolution of process there.
What can be said is that there *appears* to be a very large
cache from which rather few docs have been released. Given
that most of what has been out is not truly damaging or earth
shattering, but merely embarrasing and key confirmatory of
suspicions... games of releasing just a few is disapointing,
and the pace is falling off. Maybe that is just waiting for
US election cycles and various moments now.

Then there is question if your client will select such 'only *coin' nodes

There are also a fair number of hidden services in Tor/I2P/CJDNS
that act as bitcoin nodes.
As related tangent, yes, the bitcoin protocol needs to be encrypted
on the wire, at least bitcoin node to bitcoin node with TLS, obviously
and urgently so, particularly if you wish to guard your trans from
wire listeners.
You might be best to in fact run bitcoin always and entirely over Tor,
especially while transacting.
But then also routinely compare that received blockchain to one
you receive via alternate/trusted sources, such as clearnet or signed
bittorrent checkpoints.

and new meanings of simple words to justify spooky outrageous
behavior!  Support civil rights attorneys using principled arguments
rooted in constitutional and societal norms to defend YOUR rights!
Perceive the wheels of justice or just-us grinding the constitution
into effect or into irrelevance!  Show the judges and the press that
the public cares whether NSA gets away with using totalitarian
methods!  See the constitutional issues around mass surveillance
actually be discussed in an open, public court that actually hears
from someone other than the government!  The good guys won this case
at the district court (the judge declared the NSA's actions
unconstitutional), and the government had to appeal it to stop the
ruling from killing off the program.  This case could be very
interesting, and these judges could make the final decision if the
Supreme Court decides not to review their decision.
Please be respectful, wear a costume (banker or politician duds
suggested), and arrive without contraband, weapons, penknives,

Bring either a lawyer (who can sign you in) or bring
unconstitutionally required identifying documents, or the US Marshals

Media Alert: EFF, ACLU to Present Oral Argument in NSA
Spying Case on Nov. 4
Court Should Rule That Mass Telephone Records Collection Is
Unconstitutional in Klayman v. Obama
Washington, D.C. - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
will appear before a federal appeals court next week to
argue the National Security Agency (NSA) should be barred
from its mass collection of telephone records of million of
Americans.  The hearing in Klayman v. Obama is set for 9:30
am on Tuesday, Nov. 4 in Washington, D.C.
Appearing as an amicus, EFF Legal Director Cindy Cohn will
present oral argument at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit on behalf of EFF and the
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which submitted a
joint brief in the case.
Conservative activist and lawyer Larry Klayman filed the
suit in the aftermath of the first Edward Snowden
disclosure, in which The Guardian revealed how the NSA was
collecting telephone records on a massive scale from the
telecommunications company Verizon.  In December, District
Court Judge Richard Leon issued a preliminary injunction in
the case, declaring that the mass surveillance program was
likely unconstitutional.
EFF argues that the call-records collection, which the NSA
conducts with claimed authority under Section 215 of the
USA PATRIOT Act, violates the Fourth Amendment rights of
millions of Americans.  Separately, EFF is counsel in two
other lawsuits against the program -- Jewel v. NSA and First
Unitarian Church of Los Angeles v. NSA -- and is co-counsel
with the ACLU in a third, Smith v. Obama.

Quality counterfeiters of US notes don't care what BEP/FED/TREAS
discloses, they just reverse engineer the bills. Also note that bills before
1990 have nearly trivial security and are still legal tender. There is a model
year vs. timespan "ain't seen one of those lately" acceptance risk with
older bills but that's about it. Either way, don't worry, your average gov't
deflates bill value by printing, more than any counterfeit factory ever
would want to.
Note that paper money can be cloned with far less cost than
any known attack on say Bitcoin, and with more profit since
you still have the bills, but unless you can steal a tiny percent
of the coins quietly all you'd do is bring the network trust to zero.

" Rather than using specific frequencies UWB transmitted on all

the frequency band to expect a bit to appear. Two parties with
synchronized clocks and codebooks could agree that at 10 nanoseconds
after the hour at a certain frequency or range of frequencies a bit
would appear if one was intended. The presence of that signal at that

References: On Wed, Sep 17, 2014 at 9:43 AM, Henry Augustus Chamberlain
Putting keys into some_encoding at example.com might cover
some bases related to offline key lookup and message validation.
Most user and system mail tools would need changes to handle
string width and keytype, addressbooks updated, etc. Totally burying
OpenPGP, passphrase and key lookup/use behind a fully integrated
MUA GUI for grandma would work just as similarly well right now today
with no such encoding.
But in the end, all you're doing is covering the message body, and in today's
world that's clearly not enough. No one's yet solving the huge issues
with leaving mail exposed to what is essentially open-for-all-to-inspect central
storage and mail routing. The "who's IP talking to who", "From To Subject,
daemon headers, etc" metadata, when, how much/often, provider logs, someone
sending you unencrypted mail, you giving up your private keys to the
provider or running blobs they provide to you, etc. This is all unfixable with
traditional "Email" models.
This is why that to really solve anything more than the message body,
you need to go completely nextgen and turn that 'email address' into
an anonymous P2P overlay network node address, run your overlay
client [which supplies a mail/messaging front end] and send/receive
mail through that from/to your usual MTA/MUA/messaging toolchain.
The real work there is in pushing the P2P node count up...
- Research how many users globally might leave their messaging
node up 24x7 for a direct realtime overlay connection with the far
end "user at node"... 1/10/100/n*1000 million?
- Develop message storage [and forward/poll/expiry] within the
overlay for those that aren't in online mode.
- Determine any hardware limitations and thin client models.
There is an ongoing thread with the subject
 "The next gen P2P secure email solution"
that contains various people's initial thoughts/framework on this.

Yes, there should be more comparative analysis
of approaches amongst all the current networks. Create
a dedicated group that publishes such things on a darknet wiki.
Hold not just project specific meetups as is done today, but
genuine summits amongst all such projects that puts
their specific projects aside and determines what models
might best suit the next 10-20 years. Determine whether the
community is too chained by legacy project/product entrenchment
to adopt new better approaches that have come up in research
since they themselves started their own projects. Find
any worthy new techniques and peel off interested developers
into new projects. Try to ensure that big well known
projects aren't soaking up all the fanfare/funds when
equally valid small projects, or new projects would benefit
the world the same or more than the gorilla in the room.
For example, there seems some merit in filling your
internode links with chaff padding up to the bandwidth
limit you configure in order to mask both when and
how much you are communicating.
But it does not seem any project is doing that?
Perhaps because chaff transmission/management/security
models are not well developed. Or just the 'woah, bandwidth'
reaction, which in reality of the simplest design only
affects you and what bw you were willing to purchase
or experience anyway (as when operating under a
non-chaff network with a given/high utilisation condition).
Another example... there was, or is, at least one group
accepting funds and then running some of the various
overlays equally at once... tor, i2p, freenet, cjdns, mailmix.
Take some time to step back and see what together you
can do with the big picture in all areas... research, development,
operations, marketing.

Wiretapping usually involves collecting content or traffic metadata
that is identifiable to the user. When not against a specific user,
disclosing a real IP address in itself might be more of an edge case
along the lines of circumvention of the tech, cracking what the user
setup, etc. There probably need to be test cases to cover these areas
as applied to anonymity networks.
That's still thinking in terms of some BS non-full-disclosure
legal/professional/industry play-nice rules. There's no reason
why, if their is no crime, no contractual party loss, etc that
the 1st amendment can't be used to disclose it.
And ZERO reason whatsoever that the research cannot simply
be anonymized, rewritten and anonymously posted somewhere

instead of answering the question.
The 'research' was posted to throw up red flags about these projects
for anyone searching so the can see and form their own opinion.
The world does not need more closed source.
And it does not need more non-reproducible binaries.
ESPECIALLY from software projects claiming to protect users privacy
through encryption, and further enticing the masses to run them by
putting cute little doggies on the tin.
Fix your code then. Reproducible builds are a MUST for any
security/privacy project like yours.
I'm not going to waste time attempting to build stuff that apparently
no one but you and or your devs have been able to build. And I'm
not going to waste time disassembling the binaries either.
Post your SHA-256 reproducible build instructions on the wiki's for
your projects. Then ask for build confirmation/review from the
Until you either ...
A) Quit distributing binaries
 or
B) Tell people in a COMPILING doc included in the sources how to
make binaries that SHA-256 match the ones you distribute
 and then
C) Answer why you claimed to be announced/partnered with EFF/CCC
(which they have both denied [1]), why you are continuing to mimic
the Tor homepage/TBB, why you're directly spamming people with
invites, why you are dodging these and other questions, and generally
appearing and acting very unusual for an opensource privacy suite
... no one is going to believe these projects are anything but
untrustworthy snake oil.
Help us help you.
In my opinion at this time, these (your) projects have serious trust
issues and I wouldn't recommend them until resolved.
And while this list isn't perfect or comprehensive, those needing
privacy solutions have other options to choose from here...
License issues...
An example of a decent model announcement and request for review,
that your seeming sockpuppet then replied to with a lure...
Old stuff... (RetroShare?)
Can anyone provide an overall interpretation in English of posts?
Ps: To date, none of the people potentially related to these projects
that I previously CC'd seeking comment from have replied either.

References: If I wanted to try Unix/OBS versions I would. And I might if these
issues are ever resolved and they are picked up and looked at by
more Unix's.
I'm defending users who might be considering running the binaries
you distribute. As far as I can tell, no one has ever been able to
reproduce them from your sources. And you haven't posted sufficient
details about your platform to make whatever compilation notes you
posted worthwhile. "32 bit windows" could be anything.
I also can't find OpenPGP signatures for the binaries or the sources
that you distribute.
Nor can I find a reply from you or "Mike Weber" or anyone else
regarding all these issues.
So if I use the source without blobs I'm safe, but if I use your
windows binaries I'm rooted? Or should this mean that you know
windows sucks but you're writing to it anyways, and perhaps you
don't care much about the implementation quality there.
Now because you're a member of GoldBug Messenger on SF...
Are you suggesting that users ignore the falsehood you put in your
announcements and just trust your software?
(Is that what all those anonymous 5-star 1-review posts of GoldBug
to mostly second and third class windows software aggregator sites
are about... building trust? You can google for those.)
Or are you saying that you somehow forgot to post your own project
denial of Randolph / Thomas posting as if they were associated with
your projects?
Ok, well maybe you did forget that, so let's see who has control...
"Brought to you by: berndhs, mikeweber"
... and what they do with that control...
This gnupg thread also shows two other witnesses to...
"This project does not allow reviews to be posted."
Now of course back then "Mike Weber" may have been the only one in
the SF GB project, plus the apparent, in my opinion, shills Thomas
and Randolph.
However, you are now also on the SF GB project since at least Oct 26 2013.
So lets see if your project has improved its behaviour since pointed
out by people on gnupg list in Jul 2013... no it hasn't.
To wit: Your project just censored my post and turned on list
moderation so that no one else can speak. Oopsie, footshot ;-)
"1 message has been excluded from this view by a project administrator."
14 out of 15 posts.
"Your mail to 'GoldBug-Forum' ... is being held ... Post to moderated list"
So the question now begs, with you being fully aware, and perhaps
even complicit... why do you remain associated with projects that
have serious issues? If you choose to remain, you definitely need
to get "Mike", and you, to post an answer on this stuff. And if you
choose to leave, an exit statement from you would surely serve you
well as a possible member of the FOSS/Suse community.
As long as all these questions remain unanswered, I will not quit
defending users, or the names of Tor, EFF, CCC.

In those threads and links following from the above are people
showing that these 'goldbug' related projects have serious trust
issues and may be some form of malware/crapware. Read the
linked threads for more info.
If you search around wikipedia for these projects and
look at their edit, talk and contributor histories you can
find their edit trails there. Bogus listings is their way of
free advertising and luring gullible users to them.
I don't know much about how these things are handled within
wikipedia community. But I have seen articles that have
'Controversy' sections in them.
So if I were an editor I'd add exactly such a controversy section
to all the pages... that some people see big issues with these

Number portability and more... trivially redirected to anywhere
for MITM... courtesy Neustar.
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Not directly crypto-related, but an example of the tangle of
relationships that drive surveillance:
reports on a backstage argument going on in Washington about a special
network/database - oddly never named in the article - that "rout[es]
millions of phone calls and text messages in the United States".
Apparently this was a system created back in the late 1990's to
implement number portability.  It's not clear from the article whether
it's a database of number-to-carrier mappings, or actually routes call
based on such a database.
A small Virginia company named Neustar created the system and has
managed it ever since.  Recently, the major carriers recommended to
the FCC that Neustar be replaced by Telcordia, an American subsidiary
of Ericsson, which allegedly can do the job more cheaply.  The
"intelligence community" has been pushed to leave the job in Neustar's
hands, claiming that letting a European company run the system would
leak important information about how US surveillance of the phone
networks is implemented.
Neustar, obviously no stranger to the Washington inside game, has
hired good ol' Michael Chertoff to represent them.
The bullshit and inside baseball and lobbying here runs so deep you
can't see bottom.  And underneath it all, another piece of the vast
tapping network we've built in the US in the last 12 or so years is
revealed, just a little bit.

@_subject: Massive License Plate Databases 
On April 2, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released a
Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) that describes how the DHS Immigration
and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – including ICE’s primary investigative
offices, Enforcement and Removal Operations and Homeland Security
Investigations – will find the present and past location of drivers by
accessing a massive private database of vehicle location information.
The program raises serious privacy concerns, with the specter of
individuals’ location data being collected on a mass scale, stored for
a prolonged period, and used without effective restrictions.
According to the PIA, both fixed and mobile license plate readers
record license plate number, a digital image of the license plate, the
vehicle’s make, model, and state of registration, GPS location, a time
stamp, and sometimes “the environment surrounding a vehicle, which may
include drivers and passengers.” A private company – probably Vigilant
Solutions, which has amassed of database of 2.5 billion license plate
location records, will hold the data. ICE can then use license plate
numbers to query a database, and provide a “hot list” of license plate
numbers under surveillance to the private company so that when there
is a hit on one of those numbers, ICE will receive immediate notice of
the location of the license plate. Queries can uncover all recorded
sightings of a license plate for the previous five years, or as far
back as the statute of limitations for the crime being investigated.

Routers originally exported at 100% coverage, then many of them
started supporting sampling at various rates (because routers were
choking and buggy anyways, and netheads were happy with averages),
some only do sampling. Plug flow probes into network taps and you
can do whatever you want (netsec loves this and other tools).
All of the above depends on which flow export version / aggregation you
choose, until you get to v9 and IPFIX, for which you can define your fields.
In short... yes.
Flow endtime is last matching packet seen, but a flow can span records
when the time (therefore space, ie RAM) limited mandatory expiry timers hit.
UDP goes via that, TCP usually via flags. Records can span flows for
which other semantic keys may not exist, as often with UDP.
But DPI can also be used in the exporter to do all sorts of fun stuff and enable
other downstream uses (obviously TLS / IPSEC / crypto break some things there).
Tor already bundles multiple logical flows (only TCP for user today) into some
number of physical TCP flows, UDP transport there might not need
anything special.
But consider looking at average flow lifetimes on the internet. There may
be case for going longer, bundling or turfing across a range of ports to falsely
trigger a record / bloat, packet switching and so forth.
"Typical" is really defined by the use case of whoever needs the flows,
be it provisioning, engineering, security, operations, billing, bigdata, etc.
And only limited by the available formats, storage, postprocessing,
and customization. IPFIX and

NANOG list could link specific papers regarding nature of the internet.
The various flow exporters have sensible default timeouts tend cover
that ok for purposes intended.
In that various activities such as ssh, browsing, youtube, whatever
are confined to being multiplexed in one stream, that makes sense.
The exporting host has open flow count limited by memory (RAM).
A longer flow might be forced to span two or more records.
The "flags" field of some tools and versions may not mark
a SYN seen in records 2+, the rest of tuple would stay same.
Active timeout gives periodic data on longer flows, typically
retaining start time but implementations can vary on state.
Here's an early IOS 12 default...
  Active flows timeout in 30 minutes (1~60)
  Inactive flows timeout in 15 seconds (10~600)
Also consider what is wished to hide, big iso download,
little http clicks, start time of some characteristic session
rippling across or appearing at edges, active data pumping attack.
And what custom flowish things and flow settings an adversary
might be doing to observe those. Traditional netflow seems
useful as idea base to form a better heuristic analysis system.
In old netflow, UDP, where src/dst ip and port tuple is same,
just times out into a record. Some new exotic DPI might form
session context flow record based on application inside, crypto
would stop the cleartext portion of DPI.
Some flow tools don't reassemble so the frag game might slide
by them in an arms race.

Exploitation could use a few offices full of hackers and some good peering
points and hosts, not that huge $billions level of infrastructure and outside
your borders expenditure. Though blackbagging to stand up an IP in the
target net via an active tap could be useful, the driver to localize
due to cost.
Yes, bigdata still has to conform to at least some kind of cost
benefit analysis and substantiation too. Where is the line on that

References: ---------- Forwarded message ----------
CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED
I have a question someone may or may not be able to help answer.
Basically, I have in the past used the "tc" utility of iproute2 to
combine multiple network interfaces into one "dummy" interface for
monitoring purposes. (Creating a bridge via brctl has led to broadcast
storms in some network locations, so it's not an option.) Now that
I've integrated PF_RING into my sensor build and integrated the
PF_RING DAQ so that Snort uses it, I have the option to use the
"lowlevelbridge" setting so that multiple interfaces are combined by
PF_RING for Snort's purposes. The question is: Is there an advantage
of using one over the other? If I stick with using iproute2 to create
a dummy interface, am I losing capture performance that the PF_RING
DAQ could otherwise provide? (I'm not 100% certain, but I believe that
Snort is generally reporting more packet loss when using the "dummy"
interface than when using the PF_RING DAQ's lowlevelbridge option.) If

Bush said, “We need to find a new arrangement with Silicon Valley in

But when the event moderator, former CNN anchor Jeanne Meserve,

Lavabit was [nearly/actually] forced to install devices on
his network for some while, so I see no "Sorry, my
vendors config range doesn't support it" distinction here.
Telecoms like AT&T don't fight, and Vampires don't care.
The point with the NICs is that even 100Gbit taps are old news.
With that comes deployment of flow / bro / etc like things
that use them and the logs get saved because humans love
to create collect and save useless stuff... to supply on demand.
Software taps are popular, probably moreso at the network
edges... universities, corp, regional / city, colo, etc.
But costs are dropping, tech is rising, depts are doing these things.
Yes, a legit operator may be unlikely to adjust, or
to set the timeouts too low on their own free will since:
1) why, 2) storage space, 3) processing cpu / bandwidth
It's all software in the end.
I know, I'm partly diverging from legit operator context.

While reducing network traffic to various accounting schemes such
as netflow may enable some attacks, look at just one field of it...
Assume you've got a nice global view courtesy of your old bed buddies
AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, etc and in addition to your own bumps on the
You know the IP's of all Tor nodes (and I2P, etc).
So you group them into one "cloud" of overlay IP's.
For the most part any traffic into that cloud from an IP on the
left, after it bounces around inside, must terminate at another IP
on the right.
There are roughly 7000 relays, but because many of them are aggregable
at the ISP/colohouse, peering and other good vantage point levels,
you don't need 7000 taps to see them all.
You run your client and start loading and unloading the bandwidth
of your target in one hour duty cycles for a few days.
Meanwhile, record the bytecount every minute for every IP on the
internet into some RRD.
There are only about 2.8 billion IPv4 in BGP [Potaroo].
Some usage research says about 1.3 billion of 2.6 billion BGP
actually in use [Carna Census 2012].
IPv6 is minimal, but worth another 2.8 billion if mapped today.
Being generous at 3.7 billion users (half the world [ITU]),
that's 2^44 64-bit datapoints every three days... 128TiB.
Now, can you crunch those 3.7B curves to find one
whose bytecount deltas match those of your datapump?
How fast can you speed it up?
And can you find Tor clients of clearnet services using similar
method since you are not the datapump there?
What if you're clocking out packets and filling all the data links
on your overlay net 24x7x365 such that any demand loading is now
forced to ride unseen within instead of bursting out the seams?

FYI --
Obama calls out encryption in terror strategy speech
President wants 'high-tech leaders to make it harder for terrorists to
use technology to escape from justice'
7 Dec 2015 at 05:20, Simon Sharwood
United States President Barack Obama has given just his third Address
to the Nation from behind his desk at the Oval Office, to deliver a
speech in which he all-but-called-on the technology industry to allow
access to encrypted communications.
The main purpose of the speech was to offer a response to last week's
killings in San Bernadino.  Obama said investigations have found “no
evidence that the killers were directed by a terrorist organization
overseas, or that they were part of a broader conspiracy here at home”
but did label "an act of terrorism" committed by people who "... had
gone down the dark path of radicalization, embracing a perverted
interpretation of Islam that calls for war against America and the
The speech goes on to say that "as the Internet erases the distance
between countries, we see growing efforts by terrorists to poison the
minds of people like the Boston Marathon bombers and the San
Bernardino killers."
Obama therefore explains the USA's immediate response to terrorism and
particularly to ISIL, including military and diplomatic efforts, plus
some restrictions on the right to purchase firearms and stronger
screening of some visitors to America.
Future actions, Obama said, will include an attempt to "urge high-tech
and law enforcement leaders to make it harder for terrorists to use
technology to escape from justice."
The sentence isn't explained, but seems a clear reference to the
technology industry's argument that encryption is essential for
everyday life and therefore ought not to be equipped with back doors
for government use.
The term "escape from justice" also invokes a New York Times op-ed
titled When Phone Encryption Blocks Justice.  Penned by Manhattan
district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr, Paris chief prosecutor François
Molins, commissioner of the City of London Police Adrian Leppard and
chief prosecutor of the High Court of Spain Javier Zaragoza, the piece
argued that "The new encryption policies of Apple and Google have made
it harder to protect people from crime."
Similar arguments emerged after the November 13th Paris attacks, when
it was widely argued that the attacks may have been detected, and
prevented, if law enforcement agencies had access to backdoors
allowing easier and wider surveillance of encrypted communications
Obama's speech is something of a reversal, as he's previously resisted
calls for access to encrypted communications.  Hillary Clinton,
however, has called for Silicon Valley to "develop solutions that will
both keep us safe and protect our privacy," adding that "Now is the
time to solve this problem, not after the next attack."  Clinton's
remarks were made in the days between the Paris and San Bernardino

They were, and knew, the mechanisms and value of real in-person

masses of people began to encounter the internet hands on, mostly
at school.  Such that anyone today under 30 years old

therefore have no basis on which to evaluate the huge shift they

Too late? Selling out? Giving up? Or the realization of much bigger

Pirate Bay Founder: ‘I Have Given Up’
Written by
Joost Mollen
December 11, 2015 // 02:26 PM EST
“The internet is shit today. It’s broken. It was probably always
broken, but it’s worse than ever.”
My conversation with, Peter Sunde, one of the founders and
spokespersons of The Pirate Bay, did not start out optimistically.
There’s good reason for that: In the last couple of months, the
contemporary download culture shows heavy signs of defeat in the
battle for the internet.
Last month we saw Demonii disappear. It was the biggest torrent
tracker on the internet, responsible for over 50 million trackers a
year. Additionally, the MPAA took down YIFY and Popcorn Time. Then
news got out that the Dutch Release Team, an uploading collective,
made a legal settlement with anti-piracy group BREIN.
While it might look like torrenters are are still fighting this
battle, Sunde claims that the reality is more definitive: “We have
already lost.”
Back in 2003 Peter Sunde, together with Fredrik Neij and Gottfrid
Svartholm, started The Pirate Bay, a website that would become the
biggest and most famous file-sharing website in the world. In 2009,
the three founders were convicted of “assisting [others] in copyright
infringement” in a highly controversial trial.
"Stop treating internet like it's a different thing and start focusing
on what you actually want your society to look like."
Sunde was incarcerated in 2014 and released a year later. After his
time in jail he started blogging about the centralization of power by
the European Union; ran as a candidate for the Finnish Pirate Party
during the elections to the European Parliament; and founded Flattr, a
micro donation system for software developers.
I wanted to speak with Sunde about the current state of the free and
open internet, but this conversation quickly changed into an
ideological exchange about society and capitalism—which is, according
to Sunde, the real problem.
The following interview has been edited for clarity and length.
MOTHERBOARD: Hey Peter, I was planning on asking you if things are
going well, but you made it pretty clear that that isn’t the case.
Peter Sunde: No, I don’t see any good happening. People are too easy
to content with things.
Take the net neutrality law in Europe. It's terrible, but people are
happy and go like "it could be worse.” That is absolutely not the
right attitude. Facebook brings the internet to Africa and poor
countries, but they’re only giving limited access to their own
services and make money off of poor people. And getting government
grants to do that, because they do PR well.
Finland actually made internet access a human right a while back. That
was a clever thing of Finland. But that’s like the only positive thing
I have seen in any country anywhere in the world regarding the
So, how bad is the state of the open internet?
Well, we don’t have an open internet. We haven’t had an open internet
for a long time. So, we can’t really talk about the open internet
because it does not exist anymore. The problem is, nobody stops
anything. We are losing privileges and rights all of the time. We are
not gaining anything anywhere. The trend is just going in one
direction: a more closed and more controlled internet. That has a big
impact on our society. Because they are the same thing today. If you
have a more oppressed internet, you have a more oppressed society. So
that's something we should focus on.
But still we think of the internet like this new kind Wild West place,
and things are not in chains yet, so we don’t care because everything
will be OK anyhow. But that is not really the case. We have never seen
this amount of centralization, extreme inequality, extreme capitalism
in any system before. But according to the marketing done by people
like Mark Zuckerberg and companies like Google, it's all to help with
the open network and to spread democracy, and so on. At the same time,
they are capitalistic monopolies. So it’s like trusting the enemy to
do the good deeds. It is really bizarre.
Do you think because a lot of people don’t consider the internet to be
real or a real place, they care less about its well-being?
Well, one thing is, we have been growing up with an understanding of
the importance of things like a telephone line or television. So if we
would start to treat our telephone lines or TV channels like we treat
the internet, people would get really upset. If someone would tell
you, you can’t call a friend, you would understand then that this is a
very bad thing that is happening. You understand your rights. But
people don't have that with the internet. If someone would tell you,
you can’t use Skype for that and that, you don’t get the feeling it’s
about you personally. Just by being a virtual thing, it's suddenly not
directed at you. You don't see someone spying on you, you don't see
something censored, you don't see it when someone deletes stuff out of
the search results out of Google. I think that’s the biggest problem
to get people's attention. You don't see the problems, so people don’t
feel connected to it.

Keyboard). From left to right: Gottfrid Svartholm, Peter Sunde and

I would rather not care about it myself. Because it’s very hard to do
something about it, and not become a paranoid conspiracy person. And
you don’t want to be that. So rather just give up. That’s kind of what
people have been thinking, I think.
What is it exactly that you have given up?
Well, I have given up the idea that we can win this fight for the internet.
The situation is not going to be any different, because apparently
that is something people are not interested in fixing. Or we can't get
people to care enough. Maybe it's a mixture, but this is kind of the
situation we are in, so its useless to do anything about it.
We have become somehow the Black Knight from Monty Python’s Holy
Grail. We have maybe half of our head left and we are still fighting,
we still think we have a chance of winning this battle.
So what can people do to change this?
No, I think we are at that point. I think it’s really important people
understand this. We lost this fight. Just admit defeat and make sure
next time you understand why you lost this fight and make sure it
doesn’t happen again when we try and win the war.
Right, so what is this war about and what should we do to win it?
Well, I think, to win the war, we first of need to understand what the
fight is and for me it’s clear that we are dealing with ideological
thing: extreme capitalism that’s ruling, extreme lobbying that’s
ruling and the centralization of power. The internet is just a part of
a bigger puzzle.
And the other thing with activism is that you have to get momentum and
attention and such. We have been really bad at that. So we stopped
ACTA, but then it just came back with a different name. By that time,
we had used all our resources and public attention on that.
The reason that the real world is the big target for me, is because
the internet is emulating the real world. We are trying to recreate
this capitalistic society we have on top of the internet. So the
internet has been mostly fuel on the capitalistic fire, by kind of
pretending to be something which will connect the whole world, but
actually having a capitalistic agenda.
Look at all the biggest companies in the world, they are all based on
the internet. Look at what they are selling: nothing. Facebook has no
product. Airbnb, the biggest hotel chain in the world, has no hotels.
Uber, the biggest taxi company in the world, has no taxis whatsoever.
"I have given up the idea that we can win this fight for the internet."
The amount of employees in these companies are smaller then ever
before and the profits are, in turn, larger. Apple and Google are
passing oil companies by far. Minecraft got sold for $2.6 billion and
WhatsApp for like $19 billion. These are insane amounts of money for
nothing. That is why the internet and capitalism are so in love with
each other.
You told me the internet is broken, that it was always broken. What do
you mean by that and do we have extreme capitalism to blame for it?
Well, the thing is the internet is really stupid. It works really
simply in a simple manner and it doesn’t take any adjustments for
censorship. Like, if one cable is gone, you take the traffic through
some other place. But thanks to the centralization of the internet,
(possible) censorship or surveillance tech is a whole lot harder to
get around. Also, because the internet was an American invention, they
also still have control of it and ICANN can actually force any country
top level domain to be censored or disconnected. For me that’s, a
really broken design.
But it has always been broken, we just never really cared about it,
because there always have been a few good people that made sure that
nothing bad happened before. But I think that’s the wrong idea. Rather
let bad thing happen as quick as possible so we can fix them and make
sure it does not happen in the future. We are prolonging this
inevitable total failure, which is not helping us at all.
So, we should just let it crash and burn down, pick up the pieces and
start over?
Yes, with the focus on the big war on this extreme capitalism. I
couldn’t vote, but I was hoping Sarah Palin won last time in the US
elections. I’m hoping Donald Trump wins this year’s election. For the
reason that it will fuck up that country so much faster then if a less
bad President wins. Our whole world is just so focused on money,
money, money. That’s the biggest problem. That’s why everything fucks
up. That’s the target we have to fix. We need to make sure that we are
going to get a different focus in life.
"We don’t have an open internet. We haven’t had an open internet for a
long time."
Hopefully technology will give us robots that will take away all the
jobs, which will cause like a massive worldwide unemployment; somewhat
like 60 percent. People will be so unhappy. That would be great,
because then you can finally see capitalism crashing so hard. There is
going to be a lot of fear, lost blood, and lost lives to get to that
point, but I think that’s the only positive thing I see, that we are
going to have a total system collapse in the future. Hopefully as
quick as possible. I would rather be 50 then be like 85 when the
system is crashing.
This all sounds quite like some sort of Marxist revolution: a total
crash of the capitalist system.
Well, yeah, I totally agree with that. I’m a socialist. I know Marx
and communism did not work before, but I think in the future you have
the possibility of having total communism and equal access to
everything for everybody. Most people I meet, no matter if they are a
communist or a capitalist, agree with me on this, because they
understand the potential.
So, is there like a concrete thing we should focus on? Or do we need
to aim for a new way of thinking? A new ideology?
Well, I think the focus needs to be that the internet is exactly the
same as society. People might realize that it’s not a really good idea
to have all of our data and files on Google, Facebook and company
servers. All of these things need to be communicated al the way to the
political top, of course. But stop treating internet like it's a
different thing and start focusing on what you actually want your
society to look like. We have to fix society, before we can fix the
internet. That’s the only thing.

Reject  and the Co-Opting of Anonymous
In this new writing, Jeremy shares his views on Anonymous, and the recent wave of anti-immigrant sentiment that has been sweeping
the nation.
The attacks in France were a terrible but unfortunately predictable
response by desperate people who, after a decade of war and
occupation, want the west to taste what we have been regularly dishing
out. But we cannot allow them to be used to justify more war.
In the wake of the Paris attacks, the Western governments are
provoking Islamophobic hatred in order to escalate military operations
in the Middle East and push police state powers. It’s a familiar
script, and from prison, I’ve been following these developments,
disturbed about the attacks on immigrant and Muslim communities and
the resurgence of the fascist right.
I remember in the wake of 9/11, the waves of blind patriotism and
xenophobia that the war-mongering politicians used to push
police-state laws, mass surveillance, and rampant militarization. It
was never about fighting terrorism or weapons of mass destruction, but
about US empire: control over land, oil, and drug production, like all
wars. Hundreds of thousands of innocents were murdered by the US
military over the longest war in our history while we escalated drone
warfare elsewhere in Syria, Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia, creating the
conditions which gave rise to ISIS in the first place.
That same post-9/11 hysteria is back and all the war-mongers are again
frothing at the mouth with hate for immigrants and refugees, pushing
for national Muslim registration databases, and for regime change in
But I never thought Anonymous would join in on their frenzied call for
war. Apparently, GhostSec and others purportedly associated with
Anonymous have been DDoSing forums, taking down Twitter accounts, and
reporting IP addresses to law enforcement in collaboration with shady
military contractors like Kronos Advisory. The naïve fools behind the
operation are being manipulated by intelligence agents taking
advantage of the emotional reaction to the Paris attacks to harness
our skills to fight their hypocritical “war on terrorism.”
As someone who hacked with Anonymous and marched against the war in
Iraq, I completely oppose  and any attempts to co-opt our
movement into supporting the government’s militaristic agenda.
Escalated US military involvement is certainly going to result in more
civilian deaths, as it already has. All deaths of innocent civilians
are a tragedy, and we cannot value one life over another. (And you are
still more likely to be shot down by police than in a terrorist
The same intelligence industry that runs their own NSA hacker
operations against ISIS uses the same counter-terrorism justification
to spy on everyday civilians with no regards for rights to privacy,
encryption, or anonymity. They have always targeted Anonymous and
other dissident groups as terrorists, and when they aren’t trying to
discredit or imprison us, they are attempting to co-opt us – sometimes
openly by attending conference like DEFCON, seducing us with promises
of money or calls for patriotic duty, other times covertly lurking
around IRC channels attempting to steer us unwittingly into supporting
their agenda. Remember, Sabu asked me to hack government websites of
Syria and Turkey, among others, which I did, unaware he was an FBI
informant. They didn’t want to talk about it at my sentencing hearing,
but they did condemn my attacks against police and military
contractors at length. The agents out there encouraging you to “hack
the terrorists” will have no problem turning around and locking you up
for years if you are not useful to their agenda.
We won’t let Anonymous be unwittingly used to further the military
industrial complex’s imperialistic operations around the world. We
don’t work for the government – we are against all governments. We are
on the side of the oppressed, not the oppressors. We support the
victims of war, not the war-makers. If you want to report membership
lists and IP addresses of suspected terrorists, go join the CIA or
hang out with wannabes like Stratfor or the th3j35t3r. Call it
state-sponsored hacking, patriotic hacktivism, whatever – just don’t
you dare call yourselves Anonymous.
I urge my comrades still out there in the trenches, sitting on some
hot 0day, ready to loot databases and trash systems. If you want to
stop war and terrorism, target who Martin Luther King Jr. called the
“largest purveyor of violence in the word today” – the US government.
So Anonymous, get to it – drone manufacturers, white hat infosec
contractors, CIA directors, Donald Trump, and your local police
department – they all have blood on their hands, they are all fair

Taler technology: About taxability, change and privacy
One of the key goals of Taler is to provide anonymity for citizens
buying goods and services, while ensuring that the state can observe
incoming transactions to ensure businesses engage only in legal
activities and do not evade taxes (such as income tax, sales tax or
value-added tax). However, we also want to stay out of the immediate
personal domain, so sharing funds within a family or copying coins
between devices should not be subject to monitoring by the state.
In Taler terminology, we distinguish between transactions where the
exclusive ownership of the value of a coin is passed from one entity
to another, and sharing whereafter control over a coin is shared by
multiple electronic wallets (which may belong to different
individuals). In Taler, the receiver of a transaction is visible to
the state and thus can be taxed, while sharing is invisible to anyone
not involved. Once a coin is shared among different individuals, any
one of those can try to spend it, but only the first spender would
succeed. Thus, sharing requires a strong trust relationship among the
individuals involved, and thus represent interactions in the protected
immediate personal domain, and not commercial transactions.
When Taler needs to provide change, for example because a customer
only has a 5 Euro coin but wants to make a 2 Euro purchase, it needs
to create fresh coins (of a total value of 3 Euros) that are
unlinkable to the original 5 Euro coin to ensure privacy. To ensure
that the resulting refresh operation where the change is converted to
fresh coins cannot be used to transfer funds from one entity to
another, Taler ensures that any owner of an original coin that was
involved in a refresh operation can follow a link to the private
information of the fresh coins generated by the operation. As a result
of this trick, refresh operations cannot be used to create transfers,
as the linkage ensures that the fresh coins are always shared with the
owner of the original coin.
As a result, Taler does not intrude into the personal economic domain,
offers good privacy, taxability for transactions and the ability to
give change.

FYI -- "it's a surveillance bill by another name." -- Senator Ron Wyden
Go to the following web site; they will connect you to a number of
people at the White House who are getting irritated by so many calls!
Congress Drops All Pretense: Quietly Turns CISA Into A Full On Surveillance Bill
by Mike Masnick
Tue, Dec 15th 2015 9:28am
Remember CISA?  The "Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act"?  It's
getting much much worse as Congress and the administration look to ram
it through -- and in the process, removing any pretense that it's not
a surveillance bill.
As you may recall, Congress and the White House have been pushing for
a "cybersecurity" bill for a few years now, that has never actually
been a cybersecurity bill.  Senator Ron Wyden was one of the only
people in Congress willing to stand up and directly say what it was:
"it's a surveillance bill by another name."  And, by now, you should
know that when Senator Wyden says that there's a secret interpretation
of a bill that will increase surveillance and is at odds with the
public's understanding of a bill, you should know to listen.  He's
said so in the past and has been right... multiple times.
Either way, a version of CISA passed the House a while back, with at
least some elements of privacy protection included.  Then, a few
months ago it passed the Senate in a much weaker state.  The two
different versions need to be reconciled, and it's been worked on.
However, as we noted recently, the intelligence community has
basically taken over the process and more or less stripped out what
few privacy protections there were.
And, the latest is that it's getting worse.  Not only is Congress
looking to include it in the end of year omnibus bill -- basically a
"must pass" bill -- to make sure it gets passed, but it's clearly
dropping all pretense that CISA isn't about surveillance.  Here's what
we're hearing from people involved in the latest negotiations.  The
latest version of CISA that they're looking to put into the omnibus:
1. Removes the prohibition on information being shared with the NSA,
allowing it to be shared directly with NSA (and DOD), rather than
first having to go through DHS.  While DHS isn't necessarily
wonderful, it's a lot better than NSA.  And, of course, if this were
truly about cybersecurity, not surveillance, DHS makes a lot more
sense than NSA.
2. Directly removes the restrictions on using this information for
"surveillance" activities.  You can't get much more direct than that,
3. Removes limitations that government can only use this information
for cybersecurity purposes and allows it to be used to go after any
other criminal activity as well.  Obviously, this then creates
tremendous incentives to push for greater and greater information
collection, which clearly will be abused.  We've just seen how the DEA
has regularly abused its powers to collect info.  You think agencies
like the DEA and others won't make use of CISA too?
4. Removes the requirement to "scrub" personal information unrelated
to a cybersecurity threat before sharing that information.  This was
the key point that everyone kept making about why the information
should go to DHS first -- where DHS would be in charge of this
"scrub".  The "scrub" process was a bit exaggerated in the first
place, but it was at least something of a privacy protection.
However, it appears that the final version being pushed removes the
scrub requirement (along with the requirement to go to DHS) and
instead leaves the question of scrubbing to the "discretion" of
whichever agency gets the information.  Guess how that's going to go?
In short: while before Congress could at least pretend that CISA was
about cybersecurity, rather than surveillance, in this mad dash to get
it shoved through, they've dropped all pretense and have stripped
every last privacy protection, expanded the scope of the bill, and
made it quite clear that it's a very broad surveillance bill that can
be widely used and abused by all parts of the government.
There is still some hesitation by some as to whether or not this bill
belongs in the omnibus bill, or if it should go through the regular
process, with a debate and a full vote on this entirely new and
different version of CISA.  So, now would be a good time to speak out,
letting your elected officials and the White House know that (1) CISA
should not be in the omnibus and (2) that we don't need another
surveillance bill.
In the meantime, if Congress were actually serious about
cybersecurity, they'd be ramping up the acceptance and use of
encryption, rather than trying to undermine it.
Opponents launch 11th-hour campaign to kill cyber bill
By Cory Bennett - 12/14/15 03:54 PM EST
Privacy advocates have launched a last-ditch campaign to block a major
piece of cybersecurity legislation that could soon be added to an
expected omnibus spending deal.
The bill would encourage companies to share more data on hackers with
the government.
Fight for the Future, which has been leading a coalition of digital
rights and civil liberties groups opposing the measure, on Monday
launched an online petition urging the White House to veto the final
legislation.  The group also included a widget that allows people to
call the White House to express their opposition.
Privacy advocates have long argued that the legislation would allow
the intelligence community to collect more private data on Americans.
Technologists and numerous technology companies have expressed similar
But many industry groups, lawmakers and even the White House counter
that the bill is the necessary first step in the fight against
hackers.  Privacy provisions in the measure will ensure personal data
is not shared throughout the government, they say.
"Now is when we'll find out whether President Obama really cares about
the Internet and freedom of speech, or whether he's happy to roll over
and allow technologically illiterate members of Congress break the
Internet in the name of cybersecurity," said Evan Greer, campaign
director at Fight for the Future.
Lawmakers are on the cusp of having a final text ready and hope to
have the bill on President Obama's desk before the year's end.
Negotiators have been working since the Senate passed its Intelligence
Committee-originated bill in October, six months after the House
passed two complementary bills: one from the Intelligence panel,
another from Homeland Security.
On Monday, privacy advocates said that lawmakers had decided to attach
the bill to an omnibus spending bill that is expected as soon as
Monday.  Most observers believe the tactic gives the cyber bill its
best shot of getting through Congress in 2015, as only a handful of
legislative days remain before the upcoming recess.
But several people with direct knowledge of the talks cautioned that
no final decision had been made.
Multiple lawmakers have expressed opposition to the strategy, arguing
that the final cyber text should get a standalone vote in both
chambers.  Their resistance threatens to kill the omnibus strategy.
If the cyber bill does roll through Congress, Fight for the Future
called on the White House to reject the measure.
Throughout the final negotiation process, digital rights groups have
warned that lawmakers were omitting the most stringent privacy
clauses, a claim the bill's backers reject.
"This administration promised to veto any information sharing bill
that did not adequately protect Internet users' privacy, and the final
version of this bill doesn't even come close," Greer said.  "It's time
for President Obama to deliver on his word."

If selling to governments for certain of their use cases and inherent

The Dawn of the Crypto Age
by CANNON C. , in the year 2015
- -An essay on how crypto technologies will shape our world, and why
these technologies are often met with government opposition-
 Throughout all of the chapters of history, civilization struggles in
a constant battle between liberty and tyranny, progression and
corruption. For the world is plentiful in numerous points of its
history of a populace oppressed by governments. Like a beast untamed
or loosened, or a fire fueled and spread, it is the natural tendencies
of governments to become corrupt and to perpetually expand and
maintain power. This is not because government in itself is corrupt,
but rather because mankind is corrupt through greed, in the pursuit of
wealth and power at the expense of a nation while utilizing the
powerful body of government as their tool. Government makes a handsome
target of exploitation to the corrupt and enemies of liberty due to
the centralization of power that governments wield and the position of
the tool of government being in the high layer of power, known as the
political realm.
 Until now, the balance of power sat in the hands of governments who
have gone rogue at the conduction of usurpers and tyrants and have
been used to empower themselves while oppressing the populace and
liberty, whether openly or covertly. However, in the modern age, in
this dawn of the crypto revolution which follows the still advancing
and parallel technological revolution, the balance of power in the
world is shifting from that of governments and usurpers to the people.
 Throughout history, humankind has been through various golden ages of
enlightenment, and of technological advancements and progressions. It
is this evolution in the advancement of humankind which has altered
the foundation for which future technology and the direction of
civilization is based. We have had the Age of Enlightenment, the
scientific revolution, the Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution, and
the technological/informational revolution, to name a few. And now,
even when the latter is still young, we enter another age that
parallels it: the dawn of the crypto revolution, which is based upon
the infrastructure of the current technological/informational
 The context of the word "revolution" in the case of this writing
refers to that of sudden change in the world brought about by
advancements in technologies and discoveries, while "crypto" or
"cryptographic" is referring to the use of encryption (codes) paired
with technology to create systems immune to espionage, control, and
takedown by an enemy.
 The newly emerging technology brought about by the crypto revolution
is built on our current technological infrastructure. The advent of
our current computerized cyber-infrastructure makes an easy way to
build, host, and deploy decentralized protocols. It is also cyberspace
that connects us all and breeds innovation through uncensored and
decentralized communications such as the Internet, hence why the
crypto revolution began shortly after the birth of the technological
revolution. This new technology will secure itself and also secure
society from the current flaws in our informational technology
infrastructure which that same society has come to rely upon.
 The crypto revolution will alter the shape of the workings of
civilization in positive ways to advance us towards a more perfect
civilization, just as the technological revolution altered the way we
communicate, do business, interact, etc. And just as how the
industrial revolution altered the way we travel, manufacture, and
live, to too shall the crypto revolution shape our world. This time,
this era in human progression will impact the workings of the economy,
politics, banking, governments... all in a way that will make the
workings of the pre-crypto age antiquated and perhaps even scoffed at
by future generations.
 Just as the crypto revolution is based on the technological
revolution which was based on the industrial revolution, so too shall
some other future progressions be based on the crypto revolution.
These future progressions as a result of the crypto revolution I
foresee being comprised of political, economic, and social
 Although progressions in the advancement of civilization are often
beneficial to the human race, advancement is sometimes met with
opposition by the existing power structure. This opposition by the
minority who wield power over the rest is due to the threat this new
technology/discovery presents to their power. Opposition can also
often be due to lack of understanding of the new technology.
 The future of technology I am describing can be referred to as
decentralized cryptographic protocols - secure, open source, self
regulating, decentralized, cryptographic protocols, to be more
descriptive. For the new way will be a better way, a way void of the
major flaws and imperfection of the former which have empowered the
corrupt and created insecure systems causing results which have
haunted our society. These newly emerging technologies will repair the
security flaws which came about by having a society that became
reliant upon informational technology. The root of many of the current
security flaws in our world come from the exploitation of
vulnerabilities that are a result of the lack of the following three
items, which I refer to together as the triangle of security.
Integrity, Availability, and Confidentiality

References: As before, take these issues to the realworld political front.
If you're a coder, you can write all the code you want.
If you're a user, you can use whatever code you want.
If you're EFF/ACLU, you can publish all the press releases
and fight all the cases under already written laws you want.
Yet politicians generally ignore the above groups because they don't
have much if any direct political action component that affects them.
What's needed is a permanent political fixture and operation similar
to the American NRA. These guys have a real, ongoing, political
agenda and impact. Candidates are actually afraid of and responsive
to the NRA's political clout... before they get elected, and before
laws get enacted... not after. The NRA email, fax, letter and call
trees, and their members who visit their legislators and stage in
public view... are very effective. Look at the banner scroller in
the upper right half of their homepage... they have a broad and
deep approach to issue outreach/embedding, even a lifestyle. Labor
unions and others are common examples of such organization. They
all do it by leveraging large monoculture bases to politics.
The NRA is 3.5M - 5.0M members strong. They turn $250M/yr from that
base (manufacturers too). They have little difference of opinion
in their ranks. They are good at crafting and pitching political
rhetoric, framing the conversation, and rendering complex issues
into simple forms that resonate with their entire base.
The EFF/ACLU representing the internet are tiny in comparison. Yet
the internet has a household penetration rate of 70%, more than
firearms rate of 35%... so a big untapped culture there. Finding 5
million (or 2% of population) internet users should be simple task.
Unfortunately, right now there are many tens of flag groups [1]
mostly doing their own thing on the net. That's not good enough,
and is confusingly diverse to both users and politicians. They need
to join together to craft and coordinate the users under a single
general banner they've been subconsciously waiting to fall in line
behind, and then start firing out actionable political things for
them to do.
Internet users could demonstrate solidarity on issues with a typical
Million User March [1]. They need to start raking in money for their
war chest and to fund ongoing operations, etc. Just like the NRA...
doing everything needed to become, and be, a strong integrated
ongoing political force to be reckoned with.

Someone was talking about this before, maybe in context of VM's.
Yet it really only works if after cold boot the key held in core for those
address segments luckily happens to be among the nonrecoverable
bits of ram. Who has researched those odds? Though defense in depth
is always good.
Another way is to introduce a simple XOR hardware mask between
the cpu and ram, keyed via some external token, wrist fob, etc.
Unlikely computer makers respond to little demand for that. And
like AMT you certainly don't want it in your "Intel" chipset.
Today you might be able to patch a kernel to switch over post bootloader
and consider its address space to now be that provided by an external
block device (sata/usb), which could then be such an encrypted mini
pluggable in the open hardware spirit of the usb RNG devices. It is the
ram, so you don't need a long term key there, random generated per boot
use is fine. Then you have moved keying issues to a smaller, manageable,
quickly blackenable device, like crushing its silicon with a thumbpress.

This is probably quite true... from his particular vantage/access point
and social network. Yet however much we may know about that side
being relatively open and shary and the capabilities there, it is not an
exclusive answer to the crypto question. None of the Snowden docs to
date are or show any real details about the crypto side of the house. He
either had no interest (unlikely), had no time, found it too risky (whether
to pull off without being caught, or over concern about some element of
grave damage), or simply had no access.
These sort of things may be important indicators. Yet to prove
them as such you'd also have to analyse the history of
FUD making, grab attempts and so on to interpret.
It could be that selective crypto is not dark, but merely expensive
to scale into being "see all" as desired with the old in clear. So
you would have to analyse the costs there. Electricity, rainbow
disk storage, real estate, cooling. How do you know the disk
makers and their suppliers do not have black wing budgets. Or
that there is not a multi billion fab lab buried under some mountain
powered by a ground radiator / aquifer cooled nuke reactor?
Yes, that's one... who is tracking where all the brilliant maths and
others go after high school? The student names in known friendly
colleges and programs? The ones that seem to drop from the
public scene? What media is publishing interviews with them?
Where are known adversary retirees that may have something
to say when invited?
To know the adversary you must continual analyse all potential
aspects, and not just aspect itself but their inputs, dependencies
and output/result chains. Then maybe you can answer some
questions. After all, the adversary is doing analysis upon you.
It's surprising that maybe no one has yet reverse engineered the binary
blobs/drivers in android to provide a fully open software stack there.
And although more difficult, same goes for the firmware blobs.
Regardless of effectiveness, it would show market demand.
Knowledge, and knowledge dichotomy within capacity of biology as
a whole to adapt evenly, seems quite a potential for scary outcomes...
As with Google, they hire a lot of Maths and others, and have been
at it for decades longer. Even generations of maths born into now.
There is too much silence from these workers.
Especially when society could probably get along just
as well without so many organizational level secrets
everywhere (wars), and now potentially against peoples
if you believe that sort of thing.
More Snowdens Please.

Possible, but you would expect crypto research to be
well compartmented from legal, sigint and offensive ops

If research does posess a break, maintaining that secret

A move to change the Minnesota Constitution to protect text messages,

enthusiastic support from a broad coalition of lawmakers and privacy
advocates, but could face roadblocks from key DFL Senate leaders.
The “My Life, My Data” movement would make Minnesota the second state
to amend its Constitution by adding the words “electronic
communications and data” to Section 10 of the document, which
guarantees “the right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and
seizures.” If approved, the amendment would appear on the November
2016 election ballot. A similar measure passed in Missouri last year
with 75 percent of voter support...

@_subject: Face Recognition Breakthrough - Why develop nukes? 
Face recognition software underwent a revolution in 2001 with the
creation of the Viola-Jones algorithm. Now, the field looks set to
dramatically improve once again: computer scientists from Stanford and
Yahoo Labs have published a new, simple approach that can find faces
turned at an angle and those that are partially blocked by something
else. The researchers "capitalize on the advances made in recent years
on a type of machine learning known as a deep convolutional neural
network. The idea is to train a many-layered neural network using a
vast database of annotated examples, in this case pictures of faces
from many angles. To that end, Farfade and co created a database of
200,000 images that included faces at various angles and orientations
and a further 20 million images without faces. They then trained their
neural net in batches of 128 images over 50,000 iterations. ... What's
more, their algorithm is significantly better at spotting faces when
upside down, something other approaches haven't perfected." ...
Why, like nukes, does society insist on developing
tech whose primary purpose upon analysis seems
only to be destructive, or of control, or in removing rights
from individuals and groups, or just plain [ab]using them
for profit? What possible quantifiable significant individualized
benefit would a single human have from such things, when
in fact they are pointed at them, instead of being wielded
in their own hands?
This isn't crypto or a weapon a human can also use to
protect themselves beforehand. Do you really need to
facial recognize your friends, your boss, doctor, or even to
seek justice [aka: revenge] after someone's already done
damage to you? Do you really care if another face has
your name so long as if the cops come, society, laws and
process are done right such that you are declared as
innocent error and formally expunged from all db's and news
and even compensated? Where is the FR in your hands? For
that matter, do any individuals in your network really need to
FR you either? In individual paired contexts, FR seems
pointless. And any benefit when used to say hunt in a
group seems thoroughly washed out by negatives on balance.
When the camera comes to your face, instinct tells
to put a mask to protect yourself. So there's something
obviously wrong with the "picture" being developed here.
Maybe it is the developers that need more cameras
in their face to get a feel for the more likely uses.

Call for Participation – ACM SigComm2015 – Workshop on Ethics in
Networked Systems Research
Co-located with ACM SIGCOMM’15
August 21st 2015
London, UK
A full day workshop titled “Ethics in Networked Systems Research” will
be held at the ACM SIGCOMM 2015 in London. This multidisciplinary
workshop will bring together two distinct groups of researchers:
- Computer scientists, network scientists and other technical
researchers who are interested in the ethical and legal aspects of
their work;
- Researchers studying the various ethical, social scientific and
legal aspects of data-driven projects in the field of computer and
data communication networks.
This workshop seeks 1 to 4 page summaries, focussing on ethical
considerations of papers, publications and projects from the two
disciplines, for example:
- Technical research in the field of computer and data communication
networks that either operates in an ethical grey zone, collects and
processes personal data/personal identifiable information, or has been
rejected from another venue on ethical grounds;
- Ethical, social scientific or legal research that reflects on – or
aims to guide – technical research and projects in the field of
computer and data communication networks, especially an analysis to
minimise the potential harm whilst enabling a broad range of Internet
research to be conducted.
Selected authors and invited speakers will present their work, which
will be followed by a structured discussion. The workshop will also
facilitate an interactive session in which participants will split
into multidisciplinary groups and address emerging ethical dilemmas in
Internet measurement and information controls research, partly based
on the submitted summaries. This session will be informed by a website
(currently under development), that presents ethical guidelines for
the fields of Internet measurement and information control. Papers
submitted to this workshop will not be archived in the formal sense,
so authors can submit papers elsewhere, or submit summaries of
previously accepted papers.
Important Dates
Paper submission deadline – March 31st, 2015
Paper acceptance notification – April 30th, 2015

Afaik, all vm's today simply pass through all drive commands.
It seems a move all the BSD's and Linux could make today,
without waiting on untrustable hardware vendors to roll out signature
verification in hardware, is to simply kernel block all commands
unnecessary to actual production use of the disk. Permit only
from a list of READ, WRITE, ERASE, INQ, TUR, RST, and so on.
Thus every other command component, including firmware update,
vendor specific, and binary fuzzing, gets dropped and logged.
It could be done as a securelevel, or compiled in.
It's definitely not bulletproof, but it does force adversaries
to add that much more exploit code and effort to
get root and go around the driver interface to access
the hardware directly. Defense in depth.
Similar tactics could be applied to other areas where
firmware and vendor/fuzzable opcodes are involved...
usb, bios and cpu.

Obviously. This is only meant to help protect clean
systems, or prevent subsequent malicious commands if
they happen to go through a user to kernel path that has
for some reason not yet been compromised (say through
the usual /dev to driver to hardware path).
Depends on how the vm is coded. My guess is vm's that emulate
say disk devices, munge those opcodes too. Yes, looking at how
virtualbox and even lightweight instances like jails code/handle it
could be useful. Try it and see :)
In all cases, having the logging capability for non production
opcodes without having to postfilter them out of some
debugging stream would be nice. Obviously again caveat
parts of the system that have not been compromised,
and defense in depth.

The link is saying different than that.
VM VDI is just a backing file on the host OS FS, opcodes likely fail here,
note in link how VM supplies fake disk VPD to guest OS.
Host OS often runs VM as root and even may assist by loading VM kernel module.
VM's can thus passthrough host OS devices to guest OS if so configured,
and if so, VM probably does not filter any opcodes, particularly if
passing an entire physical disk.
Also consider what VT-d is doing regarding sharing physical devices.
So you'd still want opcode filtering in kernel in those cases.

It may be setuid and switching users, or kernel module
or helper program or something, otherwise vbox
docs about pointing at /dev/sdx are bogus because
the raw devices aren't available to non root users.
I didn't read vbox docs closely.

It seems maybe lots of people on the tubes are, subconsciously
or not, taking such measures and actions here and there in internet,
and in life. A natural reaction of sorts. But are they not largely defensive
and never enough? Where among their list of technical defenses are
the political measures and actions needed to actually stop or reduce
that which they are trying to defend against in the first place?
After all, adblock isn't going to stop the ads. DNT isn't going to
stop the cookies. Crypto isn't going to stop the metamining
surveillance. And as in the subject, standing in line to happily get
and show their papers please isn't going to stop that either.
Where are that mass of geeks, cryptos, internets... those making
such technical measures... where are they acting in politics?
Running for office, bringing issues to their councils, donating,
and so on.

usability is concerned. Well worth the read.
And also very interesting opinion (apropos?) as to where we are as a
society right now in the evolution of the Internet, a crossroads where
our daily personal & professional lives meet:
"If you think the Internet can go on being just like it is, here's
some bad news."
"...the Internet might soon look less like 1970s New York and more
like 1990s Mogadishu: warring factions destroying the most fundamental
of services, 'security zones' reducing or eliminating free movement,
and security costs making it prohibitive for anyone but the most
well-funded operations to do business without becoming a 'soft target'
for political or economic gain."

@_subject: Dollar Value of a Datamined "Free" Service User? 
Many companies do not charge users of their services.
They say things like "It's free and always will be."
Pick any "free" service... Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Match, Reddit,
the list goes on and on.
Only the smallest of free services can be supported by someone's
personal funds. So for larger services it's well understood that if
their users aren't paying them, the money must come from somewhere.
The old model answer of former years was advertising through page
ads, clickstreams, referrals and those sorts of obvious and observable
things. Combined with burning off stock market offerings.
The new model answer includes all the former ways, plus much deeper
profiling and analysis of users, their pictures, messages, interests,
locations, etc... all done on the secret unobservable corporate
backend, and selling off that metadata to the highest bidders.
And perhaps more dollars from simply lying, violating their publicly
posted hole ridden privacy policies, and selling directly identifiable
user data as well. Or say taking immunity from prosecution from
having given/sold it away to cozy governments.
All of which have monetary values associated with them.
Companies also hide their revenue, costs, and their "active in last
three months" vs "dead user" numbers.
Some usable public statements and government/market filings are
available. And datacenter and employee costs can be approximated.
There is current value analysis, such as in selling what's hot by
this months clicks. And future/lifetime value analysis, such as
Target datamining for pregnant women to own. There are also dataset
specific values, such as names and addresses vs political alignments.
The values could be represented in $dollars per month per user.
Anyway, question...
Anyone have links to studies made within the last five years that
have attempted to calculate the dollar value of datamined users?

No, reading bits from platters or the bus is a partial analysis of
the whole firmware question. It's already been suggested in links
how firmware can hook the users unencrypted boot binaries through
to the users kernel. For that matter, a modified boot chain could
be stored in the service area.
A user would have to use SecureBoot, TPM, IOMMU, TXT, GELI and
perhaps other things, all of them properly, having no holes, together,
right now, at least three of which they are unlikely to have
ubiquitous access to until a couple hardware generations or personal
refresh cycles into the future. An ideal full solution for which
is yet to come. Not to mention needing to install it all cleanly
(from BTW, an install image which has no reproducible build and no
cryptographic chain back to the insecure unsigned source repo
But yeah, let's talk circular instead of about possible actually
coding defense in depth such as maybe blocking the most common
easiest path a malicious opcode will likely take to irrepairably
infect clean hardware in the first place... through the drivers ...
... because at least Unix is said to be immune to threat...
It's already been talked how this tech will be integrated into
everyday run of the mill malware. And how users will be subject to
infected drives via second purchase, inheritance (both from other
people and from other operating systems), use of hosting services,
trading, booting CD's, etc. Persistant malware in users boot chains
is nasty, users don't have to be of interest or be targeted, the
code doesn't care, grandma's surfbox could get it.
Please learn to email... trim the original to the minimum needed for
context, reply inline below, and stop copying 400 line digests with
meaningless digest subject lines out to everyone on the list.
Depends on the design. The hacking links or docs from the
drive/chip vendors would be more helpful there.

Aren't there really only a couple ways to solve this?
A) Somewhat similar to the IAEA, everyone pick their own trusted
and knowledgeable people, then assemble everyone's people together
with orders:
1) Respect whatever soverign secrets you see
 [profits, design advantages, etc]
2) Just tell us what we want to know
 [do the chips that come out of the fab equal the  designs that went
 into it, and are those designs free of trust issues]
This is complicated by needing to insert yourself into those legacy
areas, as well as verify essentially that of B below.
B) Contact your favorite billionaires and pitch the case for a truly
open fab. And yes, that could include starting from ...
Since that tech is already discovered, it would just be an open
rapid physical rebuild of history from transistor to today. Maybe
that would take 10 years of dedicated work to create a trusted fab
that matches todays tech and can replicate itself.
And if you think about it, it could be a profitable venture because
if you did it right, you'd be able to openly and certifiably create
trusted Orange Book / CC style hardware... something governments,
large entities and even users have always wanted but haven't been
able to obtain in affordable quantites and purposes.
This may be easier because there's no legacy to remediate.
And there's no reason you couldn't manufacture private chips too,
the only restriction being that terms that would compromise the fab
are not allowed.

Have any of those many projects gained following, review,

Windows + third party + opensource + gui + full disk encryption.
I doubt its volumes were portable like ZFS. You could Windows
mount iSCSI/SMB/NFS from a VM of FreeBSD+GELI+ZFS.
Please stop top posting.
This is a bogus argument. If you don't like that someone has copied it,
closed it, and gone off and done their own thing with it... make your
own copy and continue open development. BSD is about honoring
freedom, not about ramming freedom down your throat under threat
of suit. World of difference there. Make no mistake, the more freedom
a license gives YOU, the more free it is. What you do with the freedoms
you are given is up to you... if you choose to jerk people around, no one
will care, they'll just ignore and route around you.
Though not as free as BSD, take similar CDDL ZFS example... Sun
opened it, FreeBSD ported it, Oracle closed it, open and free people
ignored Oracle and eventually congregated at open-zfs.org. Both Oracle
and open-zfs won. If it were GPL only open-zfs would have. That's not
very free.

No. GPL does not require redistribution of mods used privately,
only if redistribution occurs are such mods required to be
redistributed.  Facebook chose not to redistribute, therefore GPL
would have made no difference because it would not trigger.
No, not unless redistribution triggers. All these giant
companies modifying GPL code to their internal purposes,
not so many  present on the mailing lists.
Yeah, apparently not...
Restrictions on piracy are what does not work.
Neither GPL or any other license apply in that realm.
No, people are free to choose their careers.
Both GPL and BSD can dual license and make millions as their own
People are free to choose that for their own software.  It's "all
rights reserved", an inalienable moral right.  Berne says so...
No, that is not what happens with BSD. You cannot close the authors
own rights, or replace their license with your own, it's "all rights
reserved". You can only close your copy of the BSD work the author
gave you.
Tomorrow, Linus/Stallman could, via Berne, slap a Microsoft style
license on all their own work contributions they ever subsequently
released to Linux/GNU under the GPL and seed their own companies
with it and be under no obligation to ever let you see it or any
future mods they make to it. You, having already received an
earlier GPL copy, can keep on with that.
"copyleft" GPL is, in fact, a restriction of freedom.
"permissive" BSD is, in fact, a granting of freedom.
There can be no argument there.
NetBSD says...
"We don't think it's right to require people who add to our work
and want to distribute the results (for profit or otherwise) to
give away the source to their additions; they made the additions,
and they should be free to do with them as they wish."
The BSD is about freedom. If someone copies BSD work and closes it,
griping happens, yet the BSD community doesn't really care because
they granted and expected that beforehand, and they keep on developing
openly. That honoring and/or supporting of free choice is their ethos.
Turns out, after getting out from under the AT&T issues, and doing
lots of cleanroom work (eg: LLVM/CLANG, adoption of BSD utils over
GPL), and enforcing what work they will accept, they're getting
that returned to them more and more and won't be disappearing anytime
BSD folks also enjoy making BSD products and working for BSD companies
that GPL folks like to falsely claim "stole" BSD licensed software.
Not being able to sell software because it's been forced open
largely wipes out an entire economic sector.
... so do perhaps communists/communals and say religious believers.
In a way, GPL folks could be seen as a bit afraid, lacking independance
or confidence, so as action in commons, (or even if not seen that
way but instead only on a mission to push and test new social paradigm).
they slap on the GPL to chain others to their belief under threat.
That doesn't seem very free.
... is the boiled down distinction between BSD and GPL.
GPL is pushing something on you once you touch it, BSD lets you
choose freely as suits you best, including from among the social
paradigm GPL is pushing.
Laws do not prevent people from doing bad things, neither do
people need licensed to do good things.

No. Copyright exists automatically in default state of "all rights
reserved". Any "restoration" you may wish or take for yourself
within that is an abuse of the author's rights as you have none. Any
rights to the author's work you may have are granted to you as the
author chooses. Subject to various limited notions...
Yes it does. The author can slap BSD or GPL on it, give it to Alice
who gives it to Bob who gives it Carl who gives it to you which you
then "use". There's no difference between the two there.
No it doesn't. This has already been explained. GPL people often
confuse freedom vs force(d open source redistribution), and permissive
vs restrictive. Don't get confused.

Exactly, everyone is in, do whatever you want. And it's almost
as unlimited as you can get under today's mandatory law for

basically two things:
1) Do what you want.
2) Author disclaims liability.

The current official charter on the homepage is:
"The Cypherpunks mailing list is a mailing list for discussing
cryptography and its effect on society."
That's probably because a wide variety of topics are applicable to
Understanding and merits of various licenses? Certainly applies to
crypto licensing, society's use of crypto, and surrounding trappings.
History of computing? Surely if you want to understand where crypto
runs and came from.
Traditional message formatting, plain text, English language?
Yes if you want to communicate broadly and effectively, especially
with people who were around well before you, to learn and carry on.
Spam is filtered from lists everywhere. People selling and tagging
every post with their own crypto related wares? They are often
technically debunked, look dumb, and end up going home.
The decades of cypherpunks list has plenty of moments and characters...
radicals, pros and antis, corporates, govts, citizens, assholes,
frauds, dreamers, tinhatters, philosophers, savants, ALT's,
shills/SP's, notorious actors, and more. All part of its history
and makes it what it is. A few people bitching or leaving is nothing
out of the ordinary in that context, in fact, that's a compliment
to the list. Unless you think Cypherpunk is all about happy
homogenized pasteurized consensus and submission, particularly with
and regarding the enemy... governments, oppressives, monitors,
privacy invaders and whatever else. Ain't no punk in that. Oi!
The magic of unmoderated lists, outside of literal spam, is that
they're usually self moderating and come back around before long.
Of further relevance to your query...
Recent thread "The Muslim Problem".
Doubt anyone here has anything to worry about in that regard.
Forking a similarly strict cypherpunks is not restricted by any
"license" if people want that (maybe the same conformists and
sheeple who complained about al-qaeda.net).

Yes, incremental helps. Yet let me open another related line of thinking...
Where are the open fabs for makers instead of submitting open
designs to closed fabs? It's 2015, crowdfunding, open source,
non-profits, and public monitoring are done.
We're not talking TSMC scale tech here, but a basic backyard shed
capability to print useable, useful, marketable silicon. ie: Print off
some USB RNG's, radios, DACs/ADCs, even 74 series and discretes,
whatever works.
Then with that open initial platform, start taking commercial
production contracts (even private runs) to pay for growing the
open fab. Even including openly replicating yourself. What is the
minimum capital and endowment needed to gear up to put 1k, 100k,
500k, 1M, 100M, 1B gates that someone, including makers, would
buy down on silicon?

@_subject: Cypherpunk reviews of products [was: peerio.com] 
Regarding peerio.com thread...
The issue there is that so far it appears they're just another
commercial startup of the day trying to figure out if they
can monetize it by witholding the server. Their interest does
not yet appear to be in you, but in holding your accounts.
Which they or govt can cancel (censor) at any time. Just like any
other centralized commercial service on the net. While not the
content, they apparently have access to all your messaging
and storage metadata and friend lists, so that's a non
improvement. And non-optional read message notification
back to the sender? Well, if you like being trapped by senders.
They claim to be 'peer reviewed' and "professionally
audited' in big letters but provide no such backing papers
anywhere. They say "tested and proven security" and all
sorts of other marketing drivel and hype (look at their github site
commits) and provide few self-caveats. Their source probably doesn't
match the binaries they're distributing. How exactly do they plan
on being "free and ad-free and not selling you" while existing past
year one. Wasn't one of the author's Cryptocat flawed too? Etc.
Here's another classic game being played...
"we [...] require the user to confirm their email or phone number."
Really, wtf, default to that if you want for the masses security/recovery
illusion, but make it optional for those that don't want the tracking
reality. Don't forget, their "invites" are not just a fun party and
name reservation, but tracking too.
Interesting API/model, it may even be a step in the game such
that you might consider inflicting on your friends, or even paying
for yourself (because free isn't free so you will pay somehow),
nothing wrong with that. But just saying its neat looks good and
whatever other two-bit reviews were made is not doing
the public much service.
Cypherpunks should in fact review and endorse "step in the
game" commercial services as they come along, if they're worthy.
(All the upstart browser based on the fly crypto central email services
not being one of them, that's what Thunderbird and Enigmail are for.)
Just know that in this field, a good review needs to call out the
marketing BS and be seriously candid about what exactly the stepwise
advances in the game are, what they defeat, how any caveats make
them moot in particular or on the whole compared to more mature
solutions, and where if anything can be improved. This isn't email,
texting, facebook, using the phone or giving a speech in public.
Privacy and crypto assertions and statements to uses for such
purposes made by products to a new and clueless user base are
serious business and have highly different needs requiring careful
analysis (even if the bottom line summary attached to it is "looks
And as cypherpunks, why not also swipe parts of its model,
replace the backend with some sort of distributed anonymous
p2p storage grid where you get what you donate over it.
Similarly, with a $10 shell account and the server side you could
have an analog to the group messaging and storage of peerio.
Further what about RetroShare and other similar things that already
It's clear that with many new products appearing, there needs to
be the emergence of reviews by reviewers that are steeped in
the same space.
Consider what could be done similar to this:

that cryptographically will either secure or not the line connection

No, this is historical possibility. Might as well throw in a copy of
Wikipedia too. Just like the seed and genome banks out there
for if/when we fuck it up. Even the cryopreservation wonks. The
whole of human knowledge and existance thing. Humanity
goes in these long cycles of destroy and rebuild, some more
severe and complete than others. And odds of higher completion
increase with inventing more non natural processes over short time
like bioengineering and nukes that have not yet reached long time
evolutionary integration/protection toward natural defence/backoff.
It's not just the US. There are world protests, but lasting real success
anywhere in the world against the pro-surveillors and anti-cryptos and
nothing-to-hiders and thought-crimers, seems yet to be determined.
That's because they apparently love using the internet for piracy so they
can watch the fucking Simpsons and football and movies and porn and
Beyonce. Portray the issues last above into them not being able to do that
anymore and you might see some riseup activity there. Probably more
than you'd see if you told them their corps/govts/friends were reading
their sexy text messages because they kindof already know that
and don't give a fuck because it's just being watched, not being *taken
away from them*. You have to take away the beer and candy and

Yes and I did say effectively as in a couple MPs may be
of muted influence... if you put 2 pro voices, 8 moderate voices
and 90 antis in a room (or any other best conceivable odds
at internal psyche on fringe issues like crypto rights) you're
unlikely to get much done other than arduously slow education.
On the other hand if getting on the ballot with a new platform is
relatively easy you can flood that with candidates and see what
happens. Either way, good thing is that we actually are now
nearing a point where odds of an elected having been exposed
to computers as an innate user and even some of these issues[1]
their whole life are getting better. Due to this maybe in another 10
years there will be an inflection and it'll just happen. Till
then we need more people strategically moving in, ie...
Just know that the other side is moving theirs in too so you
have to beat the race. Right now is a good time to do it
because the only ones really steeped in these issues are
the original internet users (or the young github/twitter activist
generation), you wait and will get washed out by the general
masses coming online behind you as future candidates, then
your trusted voice "hey this MP knows CPU's, lets ask her" is

One can afford what they wish to give to and thus expect to get from
the network in return, no more, no less, as always. (Be it literally
from the physical  NIC network, or the logical networks created by
their applications riding over and within the physical.)
Full meshing of chaff addressed to all participants seems unnecessary.
That's the simple man's kneejerk response when initially contemplating
chaffed networks.
This depends on if you're network is a low latency one, or if it
uses a store and forward model. Even that is tricky due to
needs to hide the size of data each endpoint exchanges from
passive adversaries. It begins to approach constant higher
rate the more you data wish to pass securely.
Then you must wait until you can pass your wheat. Or plan your
needs according to the give and get model.
Delays (trading latency) are not the only way to achieve security.
You may also elect to trade available throughput bandwidth in a
wheat/chaff system.
There were some research references posted in the threads below.
Yes, a lot of oppurtunity exists to create new working networks
in this area that utilize fill traffic and/or delay.
You may want to review the recent guardian-dev and tor-dev side
threads below on this exact subject of link padding, latency and
analysis. Relavent papers and talk have been posted.

a lot of born poiticians are just greasy things that care
not for problems but for themselves.
The ability, through crypto networks, for them to do
that anonymously without having to worry much any
longer about MAFIA breathing down their IP addresses.
They are a aware of mafia, they don't like mafia.

No, it has to do with good old fashioned integrity, openness and
honesty with the public. People can spot that, or lack thereof,
from miles away.
Consensus is that the very first Snodwn release, the PRISM slides
and language therein, indicated some form of bilateral partnership
with a large number of internet companies. Plus the AT&T tap room
thing, and other known early parts of the storyline.
It is unreasonable to assume that there is a strictly arms length,
Judge signed, per transaction basis going on there. Where you
have any relationship at all, loose buddy relationships develop to
various degrees.
Google is an American company. Companies and govts don't
generally wish or extend their secret jewels to offshore risk.
Though occaisionally embassies and corps do get caught
off guard or are bound by certain rules.
Data protection regimen is separate from what you elect to
do with that data. Good regimen makes it easier to control
and manage your plans, ie: classification.
This is not to say these things are true, but that there is
less and/or unconvincing evidence that they are not, and
at least resonable cause to consider that they are.
On innocence...
Why are the Boards, CEO's, Officers and staff of these
companies not speaking up and saying they had and have no
non judicially forced role in the spying of Snowdens revelations?
On resistance...
QWEST (Nacchio) tried to stand up, for a few minutes at least
till resigning and later jailed. Replaced by, AT&T's (Notebaert).
Lavabit (Levison) stood up, and closed. We're now seeing some
companies doing "good things" in this space. But that doesn't
address the original question of innocence or guilt.
On guilt...
Or maybe they're not speaking up because... like the US
refuses to disclose any of the credible terror plots and
bad guys they claim to be rolling up as mass spying result...
maybe its because they have a bit of a problem with their story
Who knows. But if you're clean and can back it, and are in the

Doubt there's any use case that requires "bignum" worth of single
fully independant "full" nodes trucking around tens of TB worth of
ancient history. With new things come new rules. Bitcoin
could declare 1/2/5/10 year checkpoint intervals by which
addresses must forward to new addresses. It could distribute
the legacy data across legacy archive farms who demand
monetize their existance as daily tx miners do. If for some reason
user wasn't able to forward in time, the farms could issue
checkpoint statements [for all] or sign their tx for a fee, user might
dissolve value back into and out of the farms under contract, etc.
Seems many different ways to solve the petabytes / phone problem.
And as long as no one, not even the anonymous ever has to
go outside bitcoin, such as to an exchange... it's still bitcoin.
What's "hard" about bitcoin is deciding how to do the tech
while still remaining true to the original philosophies.

People often miss the fundamental reasons Bitcoin exists,
the various conjoined ethos behind its creation. This is to be
expected, it's so far ouside any thinking or life process they've
ever had to do or been exposed to. It's also partly why figuring
out what to do or code or adopt, is hard. And certainly not made
any easier by the long term need and the current value at stake.
Creating a system in which a Botswanan can give a few bits
of their impoverished wages to their friend in Mumbai without
it being gated, permitted, hierarchied, middlemanned, taxed,
tracked, stolen and feed-upon until pointless... this simply
doesn't compute for these people. Their school of thought is
centralization, profit, control and oppression. So of course they
see txrate ramming up against an artificial wall as perfectly fine,
it enables and perpetuates their legacy ways.
Regardless of whichever technical way the various walls are torn down,
what's important is that they are. And that those who are thinking
outside the box do, and continue to, take time to school these
legacy people such that they might someday become enlightened
and join the ethos.
Otherwise might as well work for ICBC, JPMC, HSBC, BNP, MUFG
and your favorite government. Probably not as much fun though.

On 11 Jul 2015 21:36 -0700, from hbaker1 at pipeline.com (Henry Baker):
There's always the possibility of just asking said non-tekkies:
- If the government can't keep their secrets safe (even ignoring
various insider attacks like Manning or Snowden, let alone that which
happens at the hands of disgruntled law enforcement officers or
curious medical practitioners; see e.g. the recent US _Office of
Personnel Management_ breach, or the illicit telephone wiretapping
mess in Greece a few years ago which AFAIK hasn't ever been attributed
to anyone),
- If the companies that make software designed to allow spying on
people can't maintain security (see e.g. the recent _Hacking Team_
- If large multinational corporations can't maintain security (see
e.g. the recent _Sony_ episode),
- _Then why_ should we trust any of those to, in addition to their own
secrets, keep _our_ secrets safe? Why should _I_ trust them to keep
_my_ secrets safe?
I obviously might not be able to do _better_ (and frankly, am unlikely
to be able to do significantly better) than any of the above, but at
least I'm not creating an _additional_ extreme-value-target treasure
trove which I then fail to adequately protect.
I sometimes compare data encryption to locking your house. (Most
people accept that, even though they aren't doing anything illicit in
their homes, they don't want strangers rummaging through their
belongings.) In that comparison, "exceptional access" would be a sort
of global master key that allows trivial unlocking of _any_ locked
door, in such a way that does not trigger any alarm system or anything
else similar that the home owner might have installed.

Trying to support cloud with argument of better tech is one thing.
However tech doesn't really counter the arguments John makes.
Echoing them...
"Cloud" is every bit as much suspect in those various regards.
Foisted upon ignorant IT management who bathe themselves in the
cool-aid and false prospect of liability offloading. Pre positioned
by IT job and education system requireing "certifications" funneling
football jocks into IT instead of natural talent for sysadmin.
Supported by rent seeking and constant churn of failed contracts
into new contracts... locked up, tied down, paid to change and held
hostage until freed. Insulated by mandatory contractual disclaimers
to privacy, hacking and negligience. Perpetualized by the continual
offering of dependency teat for suckage. Huge disjoint between
interests. Your key to your door does not fit theirs. Extrafunded
by datamining and exploited by all manner of "partners" on the
It's also interesting to see insurers popping up around IT risk.
Yes, insurance can add needed diligence and rigor. But it also
indicates an industry finally throwing its hands up and saying "Ok,
we've hit the limit of reasonably attainable security".
Good sysadmins/coders are worth their weight in gold. And even if
only as advisors, you want them working directly for you, not on
the other side of some cloud contract.
Yes, the first "cloud" models were in fact an entire corporate HQ
full of thin client xterms [today: browsers] connected to the
datacenter down the hall.
Analysts and admins might say that how [new] tech and resources are
utilized is the factor, not where it's housed. Cloud is utilising
and making good offers in particular use cases, because it's free
to speculate on its own VC dime. But there are tangible caveats and
risks there that don't always equate to a dire need to scrap what
you already have down the hall. Look before you leap.

Vehicles have intrinsic baseline performance / emissions / operation
they are capable of. Computers with sensors are just there to tweak
things and tell you when it's broken. You could just as easily watch
what those systems are sensing and actuating under various conditions,
duplicate the control in your own FPGA/PIC/etc, then rip out the
factory system and put in your own. Getting a motor to run or pass
EPA isn't that hard... spend some time learn2motorheading on youtube.
cpu, rom, flash, io, control, antenna, logging are increasingly being
embedded under a single chip epoxy cap. Fewer leads to cut when the
only leads left are io to sensors, actuators and power. If antennas
become embedded there's always Faraday. Cut the service io ports.
Internal logging would still require destruction.
Manufacturers don't need used ECM's, the ECM rebuild / repair /
replacement aftermarket does.
Word. If you livin in some place that has EPA checks, newfangled Hyundai's,
and more pavement and sewers than pasture and streams... you aint country.

I submit the above is moot... you're taking your chip design in on your
USB, happy as a clam to be the one to insert it into their computer,
pull it up on their screen, and watch the whole thing play out before
your eyes... on down the line till out pops a chip in your hand, yay!
But you failed to realize their computer and software probably wasn't
made by them, nor has any open to you audit crosscheck been wrapped
around it or it's operators and maintainers... on down the line.
You can carve a stick with a knife but you can't really build a trusted
cpu with an untrusted cpu.
If the goal is to build an open trusted fab, you must build an open
trusted fab, by and with the hard and different philosophical mofos
who refuse to concur unless each step of design, build and operation
is plainly validated. Otherwise you're just selling tourist tickets to
the theme park.
This is old school TCSEC / CC applied to manufacturing.
You have cost efficiency in that the knowledge of tool and chip making
already exists. You use that savings to offset cost of rebuilding with TCSEC.
As opposed to trying to impart trust upon existing systems which
is prohibitive.
Trust is not defined by a point on a cost curve.

People talk a lot about refitting and auditing existing setups.
There's a lot of inbred friction there so the cost to successfully
do that vs. a complete ground up trusted rebuild may be roughly
equivalent. Therefore if so why not just choose the latter?
Still sounds like untrusted base, chicken and egg.
And how do you propose to count the votes when your
ballots are measured in square nanometers and your
counting machines are all made by one secretive company
and composed of anywhere between 1B and 6B untrusted
logic gates?
Did you ever hear Intel say "our own designs and fabs have no backdoors
and we're not subject to backdooring"?
Did you ever hear GlobalF say "we don't inject backdoors in customer
silicon and we're not subject to backdooring"?
Would it mean anything to you if they did?
Would it make any difference if they offered you a field trip?
Do independants actually think their oneoff decap validation project
proves or gives odds on the entire line and distribution chain?
And when was any Intel / AMD CPU last publicly decapped
and fully audited? 8088? Never?
You watch while... I collect wood and ore and smelt into axe, you
trust axe. I split tree and assemble hut, you trust hut. I put
wheel in water and make mill, you trust flour. I give you magical
computer before I make abacus, you throw in river and order me
make abacus first. Eventually trusted CPU is made.
I'd have more trust in some kid to not destroy my lawn with
the mower for $10 than some company for $50.
Govt contracts seem to deliver more debt than trust and
are prime example that trust and cost are separate. If not,
then the HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS governments spend
a year would have resulted in 5 9's of trust decades ago.
But no, they can't even keep OPM secure from crackers,
let alone backdoored cpu's they import from Malay fabs.
Put well under 1/100 of that pie a year for a few years into

As before, the knowledge already exists, so physical replication
from the ground up should be very fast.
TCSEC is not unknown, but designing and embedding it into every
process is rather new (both as mindset and applied) so it will take
some time and must be done beforehand.
Again... draw interested people from multiple philosophical sectors, use
multiple man rule, consensus rule. You don't have to trust them outside
the fab, only observe them inside. The more principled zealots like
Stallman and Juan involved the more likely somone will flag upon trust
The human problem is hard. But at the end of the day, if the outcome
of the project (trusted chips) is important, the right people will come
together to do it and the level of trust achieved will be orders of magnitude
higher than what exists today.

Those are close and would certainly be a goalpost in the
rebuild. You might be able to trust logic gates
because you can exhaustively test their logic. On the
other hand, how do you know that once you connect enough
of them to each other that their secret gates inside don't sense
each other and activate? Since you're that close to stone age anyway,
why not start one more step back at relays and core memory.
It's like trying to validate a 256 bit blackbox hash function someone
gives you... sure, their supplied test vectors may all pass, but you have
no idea or way to test what happens when you start pushing real data
through the secret instructions. You simply can't test all the possible
data combinations so you have to throw their box back in the snakeoil.
That's too complex, and the first one pre-exists so it's chicken and egg.

A purist might say that, and you'd have a hard time refuting
them because for the most part, you raced to build a system
that "works", not necessarily one you "trust" or that is proofed.
The point is, that if you're going to consider, analyze, create
and certify trust, you have to rip apart your current way of
thinking in some pretty mind bending ways. Because everyone
has been cultured since birth to accept things that are blindly
handed to them as trusted.
Where along the historical line of tools would you feel
confident or shaky in using such tool, effectively blindly
dropped into your hand, to create or do something you
trust with it, and why?
Even with things like this, when it comes to hardware it's
still turtles. You can't use an Intel CPU to crosscheck
an Intel CPU. With actors like the NSA and datagrabber
ideology inserting and rooting stuff everywhere, you probably
can't use any other closed CPU either. Destructively testing
your rig just to replace it with an untested copy is pointless.
Theoretically, if the image data is passed through a computer
to your eye on the screen, yes. Unless you know that the
entire history and process that produced the suspect gates
that were just placed in your hand (or equivalently, your
imaging rig)... is trusted.
No, use that level to build the next faster and so on.
Purists? Turtles? Who knows. But one thing's for certain,
today's hardware and production is closed. And just as
with closed source software, it would be a far stretch to
point at the billion+ transistors on your desk and genuinely
say "Yeah, I trust that".
That should be enough reason to put serious thought
and action into creating an opensource process that
could print trusted opensource hardware... an open fab.
Otherwise you're effectively saying "Fuck it".

It's a fast rebuild using trusted principles, there are no tech
discoveries needed, no loss of any tech. Yes you have to learn
to apply trusted principles, that will take time. And keep up with
whatever new tech comes after the time you start, which is normal.
So for a while you just have to work harder, faster, better. That's
standard practice and nothing new for a startup and people in them.
Ok fine, let's say you don't care to trust your chip designing
and printing hardware, and you opt to totally skip doing anything
to rebuild or validate those parts of the trust chain [1].
But you still do want an open hardware crypto phone for yourself
and the masses, which would you prefer to do:
a) wait for some bigcorp like MS/Nokia Apple HTC to convincingly
say and show an open hardware crypto design?
b) send your own open hardware design to global foundries?
c) send your own open hardware design to a comunity owned and
operated open fab (still being subject to your choice in [1] above)?
I suggest investing in (c) now will bring more and more
community and other runs through it such that you can
invest in [1] above later. You might even have to bank profit
from (b) to get to (c). But anything involving (a) is not "Lets's act",
unless you think your pleading and pressure (which is all you
can do there) will be fruitful [2]. So at minimum you best
start acting on (b) or (c). Right?
[2] Still waiting on open video cards and drivers eh, how
many decades of "raising the demand" has that been? Lol.
Oh, but Apple did add some closed crypto'ey fingerprint'ey
passphrase'ey thing to their phone, so maybe that was
pressure, and trust'ey enough, and we can all "act" by
throwing dollars at that instead of ever having our own (b/c/[1]),
and just have faith instead.
I'm tired of (a), and it's boring, and if not evil at least not really
aligned to your interests. If you want something done, carry a
big stick, or do it yourself until you have one.

GPU-based rootkit and keylogger offer superior stealth and computing power
Proof-of-concept malware may pave the way for future in-the-wild attacks.
by Dan Goodin - May 7, 2015 3:43 pm UTC
Developers have published two pieces of malware that take the highly
unusual step of completely running on an infected computer's graphics
card, rather than its CPU, to enhance their stealthiness and give them
increased computational abilities.
Both the Jellyfish rootkit and the Demon keylogger are described as
proofs-of-concept by their pseudo-anonymous developers, whom Ars was
unable to contact.  Tapping an infected computer's GPU allows malware
to run without the usual software hooks or modifications malware makes
in the operating system kernel.  Those modifications can be dead
giveaways that a system is infected.
Here's how the developers describe their rootkit:
Jellyfish is a Linux based userland gpu rootkit proof of concept
project utilizing the LD_PRELOAD technique from Jynx (CPU), as well as
the OpenCL API developed by Khronos group (GPU).  Code currently
supports AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards.  However, the AMDAPPSDK does
support Intel as well.
Advantages of gpu stored memory:
* No gpu malware analysis tools available on web
* Can snoop on cpu host memory via DMA
* Gpu can be used for fast/swift mathematical calculations like
xor'ing or parsing
* Stubs
* Malicious memory is still inside gpu after shutdown
Requirements for use:
* Have OpenCL drivers/icds installed
* Nvidia or AMD graphics card (intel supports amd's sdk)
* Change line 103 in rootkit/kit.c to server ip you want to monitor
gpu client from
Stay tuned for more features:
* client listener; let buffers stay stored in gpu until you send magic
packet from server
Educational purposes only; authors of this project/demonstration are
in no way, shape or form responsible for what you may use this for
whether illegal or not.
They provide no technical details about Demon keylogger other than to
say it's a proof-of-concept that implements the malware described in
this 2013 academic research paper titled You Can Type, but You Can’t
Hide: A Stealthy GPU-based Keylogger.  The Demon creators stress that
they aren't associated with the researchers.
"The key idea behind our approach is to monitor the system’s keyboard
buffer directly from the GPU via DMA [direct memory access], without
any hooks or modifications in the kernel's code and data structures
besides the page table," the researchers behind the 2013 paper wrote.
"The evaluation of our prototype implementation shows that a GPU-based
keylogger can effectively record all user keystrokes, store them in
the memory space of the GPU, and even analyze the recorded data
in-place, with negligible runtime overhead."
Aside from malware that taps GPUs to mint Bitcoin and other crypto
currencies, Ars isn't aware of malicious software actively circulating
in the wild that makes use of infected computers' graphics processors.
And even then, most or all of those titles run mainly on the CPU and
offload only the computationally intensive workloads to the GPU.  In
March, researchers from Kaspersky Lab documented highly sophisticated
malware in the wild that infected firmware that runs 12 different
models of hard drives.  The group that created the malware had flown
under the radar for 14 years.
In its current form Jellyfish is likely to remain a highly niche
undertaking, since it requires a dedicated GPU.  Since many computers
don't contain stand-alone graphics cards, such malware might greatly
limit the machines that could be infected.  Still, the approach may
make sense in certain situations, say for attackers targeting gamers
or video enthusiasts, or espionage campaigns where stealth is crucial.
And as readers have pointed out in comments below, it's feasible
malware could be developed that runs on graphics processors integrated
into CPUs.
Post updated to recast the last paragraph to account for integrated
graphics processors, and to add details in the second-to-last
paragraph about malware infecting hard-drive firmware.
Intel Skylake & Broxton To Require Graphics Firmware Blobs
Published on 05 June 2015 06:20 PM EDT
Written by Michael Larabel in Intel
Intel's upcoming Skylake and Broxton hardware will require some
binary-only firmware blobs by the i915 DRM kernel graphics driver.
Rodrigo Vivi of Intel's Open-Source Technology Center sent in the pull
request for landing these binary files into the linux-firmware
repository.  Up to now there's been no i915 blobs within the
linux-firmware tree.
These first i915 DRM firmware blobs are for Skylake and Broxton for
the GuC and DMC.  DMC in this context is the Display Microcontroller,
which is present in Skylake (Gen9) and newer and used within the
display engine to save and restore its state when entering into
low-power states and then resuming.  The DMC is basically
saving/restoring display registers across low-power states separate of
the kernel.
The GuC engine on Skylake is responsible for workload scheduling on
the parallel graphics engines.  Intel explained on 01.org, "GuC is
designed to perform graphics workload scheduling on the various
graphics parallel engines.  In this scheduling model, host software
submits work through one of the 256 graphics doorbells and this
invokes the scheduling operation on the appropriate graphics engine.
Scheduling operations include determining which workload to run next,
submitting a workload to a command streamer, pre-empting existing
workloads running on an engine, monitoring progress and notifying host
SW when work is done."  This page also seems to indicate that these
firmware blobs are required by the DRM driver rather than being an
optional add-on.
The license of these firmware blobs also indicate that redistribution
is only allowed in binary form without modification.  Beyond that, "no
reverse engineering, decompilation, or disassembly of this software is
These new firmware blobs will certainly have some open-source
enthusiasts less excited now about Skylake, Broadwell's successor
beginning to ship later this year, and Broxton meanwhile is the new
Atom SoC built using the Goldmont architecture and will feature
Skylake graphics.  If there's any good news out of the situation, at
least Intel is shipping these firmware files early rather than NVIDIA
that with their months-old hardware still hasn't released their GTX
900 Maxwell firmware files needed by the Nouveau driver to provide
open-source hardware acceleration.  AMD also tends to be timely with
the releasing of their necessary binary-only GPU firmware files for
the open-source Linux driver.

On most things, no. Operationally the CIA reports to the DNI who reports
to the President. Unless something goes wrong there, or is sufficiently big,
Congress won't know, and even then it's usually only four or eight people.
And when it comes to that, the VP (recently ahem Cheney) stands for the

There's certainly no easy solution to all problems. Though
there could be value in those that put more odds in your favor,
even though they do not yield 100% solution or protection.
If you rarely tx but then emit something [unique or timely]
that pops out at some [rare] destination, you're done for.
I think we've seen posts from some people who slow crawl the
web 24x7 when their client is running just to add cover at their
end for their interspersed real web activity.
By the way, does metrics report the saturation level
of the net as a whole in terms of bandwidth and processing
load for exit and non exit relays as both one [and two]
summed aggregate group[s]?
Waste is an incorrect, negative term for designed in padding (fixed
set of lengths) or fill (empty links) or chaff (ratio) or whatever this is.
A design where fill traffic gets out of the way when real data is
being sent might have periods of congestion or underutilization
of the link depending on the distance in hops the fill is managed
over, and the speed of the sensing and feedback controls.
Seems that might need to be as fast as you could initiate a first
packet across, unless you inhibit that packet until ready.
Yes, an individual relay or end node may be subject to various
billing policies (transfer vs bitrate), but see thread in reply to Titov here...
I've said that fill seems useful against passives, not actives.
However a design may actually be possible such that any disturbance
or deficiency in fill might be possible to make up from other sources.
In other words, if I knock you off the net, the remaining path your data
would have taken to your endpoint will still be filled so as not to expose
the far end as being tied to you (if the fill management scope of the
network is finer grained than just the end nodes negotiating end-to-end
with each other (ie: I think the entire net will need to negotiate their own
mesh of fill peers as an underlying management layer, with possible
cues from above)). You get knocked off, your former peers sense this
and recalc their fill sources and sinks.
Well duh, that's necessary :)
While someone's design may be insufficient to solve some problem,
it does add value in the form of talk of possible solutions and trialing
them. Thereby others can try different / related avenues to a solution.
I don't mean that Tor specifically needs to investigate or implement
fill, but that since the research area is probably not complete,
and that no operational net is trying it, it's worth continued work.
If anyone knows a good list that does or would serve as home for
such work, please say so as I'm unaware of any.

closely following these few specific issues than I.

It's true, as the world moves along, every part of it goes in cycles.
The US has been engaging in illegal surveillance of the entire
world, detaining people in hellholes indefinitely without charge
or compensation, TORTURING and MURDERING innocents (and others)
without trial, at will... including its own people on its own land.
Overseas it's gone from partnering in liberating those of faith in
the 1940's to killing them in the 2000's.
The US is pretty good historically, some examples shown in the
videos. Yet regardless of whether that's still true or is somehow
changing overall... right now, a portion of its machine is in a
cycle of NOT doing good things to others or itself.
This is a time (say ever since 2000) when, just as the US has been
known for lending a helping hand to the world, the world now needs
to stand and impart a good hand upon the US. Because the US apparently
hasn't been able to correct some of its bad ways on its own in over
15 years. It's past due for a spanking, not soundbites.
Humans are pretty good peer to peer... it's just that their meta
entities of Governments, Corporations, Religion and Society often
run astray in groupthink and need corrected now and then. And if
the world can't lend correction to simple MURDER, well what then?
Good luck correcting anything cpunks care about.
We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving.
And if spying, murder, datamining, restraints on crypto and free
speech don't resonate with whoever would do the spanking (not least
the politicians of the world), Africa's poor are still starving.

What's the url to your lifecam again?
It will never be level once info leaves your personal space.
Left unrestricted, others will collect and collude against you.
That evil bit of humanity isn't changing on any relavant timescale.
That't why you must have control over your information.
So that you are not controlled.
That's more tangibly grasped and likely... than trying to completely
rewrite peoples brains to think that eliminating privacy will somehow
work to expose and nullify attempted collection, collusion, and control.

I'd be hesitant to suggest that "onion (tor)" is the best choice
of darknet (that in which any clearnet exit feature of same is not
used), nor the best to come. However sure, any of todays legit
darknets are more attractive than clearnet for many purposes.
Darknets are now powerful spaces for generally unobservable
communication and collaboration. In particular they seem unobservable
to corporations and all lesser entities.
[Darknets have not yet proven to be unobservable to the largest
passive / active capable governments, of which a few exist. The
academic vulnerabilities are documented. There's an active arms
race. And a wait for proof.]
Physical and other abuse / crime against individual humans seems
to not be resulting in any legislative bans of darknet / crypto
Meta level things such as crimethink and active markets don't
seem to be vulnerable either.
Filesharing is an interesting proposition in that, unlike the
physical and meta, it offends another class of opponent, the
corporation. (Be it of traditional copyright consumer multimedia,
or of corporate secrets).
So the next real test may be when the filesharers move onto the
darknets. Will the corporations expend resources to observe or
legislate them, or will they give up?
The tools and stands to be tested, both on clearnet and on darknets,
are interesting, important, and necessary.
Many are moving into the darknets today, yet it will take another
decade or so to know the outcome.

@_subject: Fwd: [tor-talk] Why corrupt government officials are strongly opposed 
References: <54F52B09.9030602
---------- Forwarded message ----------
I am giving everyone on this mailing list a heads-up regarding what I
have uncovered about the Gestapo government here in the United States
and why corrupt government officials are so strongly opposed to this Tor
I can prove I have become a target after I published information on my
tlbean.com website exposing the truth about the National Security
Agency's control mechanism that is being used to unlawfully monitor all
Internet and email activity. I have had my cellphones and Internet
equipment sabotaged repeatedly after exposing the truth about the NSA
and after I published Tor-powered PrivacyGuard shell scripts on my website.
On 12/29/2014 I submitted a report to a detective about my findings
regarding foxnews.com. In my report I allege that News Corp and 21st
Century Fox are simply a guise for a government controlled propaganda
machine. I allege this based on evidence that I am bombarded by
threatening news articles and coercive pop-up ads through foxnews.com
anytime I submit a report about the NSA's control mechanism and their
psychological warfare program. These threats of coercion are directed
towards me personally based on my telephone conversations and email. I
uncovered very unique information published in news articles through
foxnews.com based on my own personal email and telephone conversations
without my permission! Foxnews.com were able to direct coercive,
threatening news articles and pop-up ads towards me personally based on
my IP address until I started using Tor!
After I investigated this extensively and figured out what was
happening, I spoke to a detective and stated that I want Rupert Murdoch,
executive chairman of News Corp and chairman of 21st Century Fox,
interrogated extensively regarding this scandal. I stated to the
detective I spoke with that Tor is a huge threat to News Corp's and 21st
Century Fox's control mechanism. Just within a few days of asking for
Rupert Murdoch to be interrogated, foxnews.com started blocking Tor!
Take a look at what my extensive detective work has uncovered:
Open this URL in a Tor-powered web browser:  News
Corp and 21st Century Fox now realize Tor prevents them from feeding
citizens coercive news articles and pop-up ads based on their IP address
and are now blocking Tor as a result of my report.
The United States Senate started blocking Tor at the exact same time!
Open this URL in a second tab of your Tor-powered web browser:
 This shady
character Senator Orrin Hatch standing next to former NSA deputy
director Chris Inglis, with a shovel in his hand, broke ground for the
NSA's new data center in the state of Utah. This super-high-capacity
data center now gives the NSA the ability to store every citizen's
email, Internet activity, telephone conversations, and encrypted files
indefinitely until the NSA's supercomputers crack the encryption. The
NSA have made a revolutionary breakthrough in decrypting high-grade
encryption in a very short period of time.
Open this URL in a third tab of your Tor-powered web browser:
 The
United States Postal Service, another arm of this corrupt Gestapo
government, started blocking Tor at the exact same time for the same reason!
Please note that when testing the URL
 or any other
corrupt U.S. senator's contact page, you may have to use Vidalia to
switch to a new identity multiple times until it lands on a blacklisted
Tor server. For some reason, members of the United States Senate have
their contact page unavailable for only certain Tor servers, and yet
Foxnews and USPS appear to be using a much wider spectrum of blacklisted
What is interesting about my detective work I conducted is that you will
notice from the "Access Denied" warning and reference # you receive when
your Tor-powered web browser tries to render the above mentioned web
pages, this indicates the exact same Tor-blocking software is being used
to power foxnews.com, usps.com, and senate.gov. This proves my point
that News Corp and 21st Century Fox are most definitely mysteriously
controlled by the United States Gestapo government.
This same thing happened after I started advertising my Tor-powered
PrivacyGuard shell scripts on craigslist.org. My PrivacyGuard ads were
immediately banned and then Craigslist started blocking Tor anonymity
protection as well, even though this took place months prior to the
above mentioned Tor blocking mechanism. Craigslist appear to be using
different Tor blocking software than what foxnews.com, usps.com, and
senate.gov are using.
Immediately after I published my first draft of PrivacyGuard in
September 2013, I can prove any of my Torified email I send to anyone
who is using a Microsoft Exchange server is classified as SPAM when sent
from Thunderbird with the TorBirdy add-on. I tested this out on multiple
Exchange servers and I get the same result. Microsoft are desperately
attempting to block email sent from anyone who uses TorBirdy.
The only advice I have for Tor developers is keep up the good work!
After I exposed the corrupt United States federal government for what
they are all about, now Tor is a huge threat to the Gestapo government's
control mechanism.

I have worked with computer hardware and software systems for long
enough to know what the difference is between equipment failure and
sabotage. I can prove my Internet equipment was sabotaged immediately
after I first submitted my analysis to this tor-talk mailing list
yesterday. I had to reflash the corrupted firmware on my router to get
it to work again. My Internet connection was under denial-of-service
attack for a prolonged period of time afterwards where I could not make
a connection. This honestly happens every time I speak the truth
regarding the National Security Agency and corrupt government officials
who are abusing their power.
Someday in the not too distant future, those of you who live here in the
United States, who have been brainwashed into thinking this is a free
democracy, will find out the truth about what this corrupt government
are all about and will look elsewhere in the world to relocate. If I was
granted one wish, it would be that someone in another part of the world
would help me relocate away from this horribly oppressive regime that
are literally holding me hostage and turning anyone against me who I
appeal to for help.

Interesting reading  - the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology
(POST) has published it's report on Tor and the (in)feasibility of blocking
anonymous access for users within the UK.
The document's a PDF, and the layout is questionable, but it's worth a read
if you have 5 minutes.
There are some interesting insights in there, from the perspective of what
LEA's see.
The overall summary though is - blocking anonymous access wholesale is not
an acceptable policy option in the UK, and would impact on non-criminal Tor
users. There _might_ be more appetite for legislating against Hidden
Services, but enforcing it would be technologically infeasible.

Like Obama and others suddenly saying he "believes in strong encryption",
while that may or may not be true, they also hold policy pens and sway
over others to back up such statements with action on the public record.
That is lacking.

No. this memory... this privacy... is in part defined by what was input and
remains in the brain memory of the individual. You walk through a park
and on the whole, nothing in particular was ever specifically input, remains
in, or is recallable from your memory.
What we have now is an applied technological error against humanity
occurring faster than the human capacity to process the ramifications.
Some would say nuclear weapons fall into this same category. It's that
old carnal visceral human control, power, advantage, destruction, against
others and innocents thing for which the only real fix is self learning and
There should be no cameras bulk surveilling public spaces, they
are offensive to the individual and their memory thus their privacy.
The only one who could have one there is the individual for their own
purposes... a personal notebook, journalism, research. Not a larger
corporation or the government against the privacy/memory of any
individual... they both can do no more than record their own front doors.
Cameras and databases are an affront to privacy whenever their context
can be or does switch from seeing blurry anonymous mass, to the individual.
Watching traffic flows is one thing, watching plates is another.
Blobby humans moving around vs. doing facialrec on them.
Yes, every individual in office of the government should be subject
to surveillance by the public during the course of their duties when
interacting with other officeholders. LE interacting public should be
taped under policy of the public as vested authority accountable.
But people need to get off the idea that if everybody watches everbody
in one big happy camera pool that all is fair and that that excuses
individualizable and individualized surveillance. And most certainly
in public or databases where there is no individualized interaction,
or permission of individualized recordee, with the recorder. That's
incorrect and against humanity.
[quoting the subject]
Bullshit. Ever walk up to someone and stuff a camera in their face?
They'll tell you to fuck off and delete that shit, maybe smash
your camera, and maybe even smash you. Same as if you try
to troll through their purse, wallet, phone, house, car, or computer.
It's not that they don't mind, it's that humans don't tend to
actively notice and rage against cameras mounted far away.
But it does register in their subconscious and builds a silent well
of rage that will someday explode singularly or in mass. Why?
Because human DNA is a free range animal, not a caged
one, and surveillance and databases are a cage. And like
nukes, humanity is a bit slow to conciously realize those
kinds of errors. The fact that people around the world are
even talking about this should tell you that something's
gone wrong and brakes need applied.
Terror is a fictional infection of news, politics, and the mind.
Rational people would know that, treat it as any crime,
accept it as the price of freedom, rebuild and move on.
Instead the world chose 15 years of ongoing irrationality.
They'll be lucky to ever realize or recover from that error.

But the spy can be selective in its use. And the more self aware it
becomes, the more that use tends toward what non spies would
consider bad.
And in many cases, what intel has today, the rich
gave them yesterday.
Now that we're becoming, are able to, and have built some
of the systems early cpunks could previously only think of
and warn about, we'll get to see if tech continues to be
sprayed about as a liberal be-all cure-all, or develops
some conscious genuine brakes.

Most researchers ultimately work for or at pleasure of
"The Man" through R&E funding, grants, taxes, etc, so
what do you expect? It's the same reason Tor Project gets
endless amounts of shit piled on them for choosing to
accept government funds. It's a fine line. At the same time
you can't deny the benefits the research, usually attacking
your network of choice... someone will do it anyways, or
patching your net more resistant. So you have to take it as
the free for all it is. It doesn't help that politic and media
representing such systems as inhabited nearly entirely by
FHOTI (and where good uses remain unseen by nature), and
whatever bits of morality regarding human subjects may
get used as cannon fodder.
Very few work truly independantly for the fame of building
resistant / resistance systems, let alone anonymously,
sustainably, and at a level that results in a usable product
that is used at scale. Just another reason anon-capable virtual
currencies are feared by governments. They can support
such models. Though as a user, due diligence is still required.
In a connected digital world, that has and is developing faster
than evolution's capacity to deal with it, everything is human
subjects, and that's something everyone involved must consider...
the outcome when your work is inevitably turned towards you
or someone or something you care about... is that the work
you want to be doing?

The common naming triple of First Middle Last may result in more

What of defense of naming with the minimum number of bits required,
in the minimum number of fields required? For example, on that root
of all human databases, the typical birth certificate.
You could be "a j smith" or "t jones", perhaps even "no name", "a
b", or simply "a". Perhaps even numbers or any UTF-8 chars.
You could expand, change and interpret them in future daily context
as desired or useful, such as "t" to "tom", "tony", "terry".
There are metrics to be applied such as "a" being the first in sort
order, and "t" being the last character with any common frequency.
And flexible phonetics that sound like names such as "d" for "dee",
"j" for "jay", "l" for "elle".
And where your minimum is less than some state or clerk idea of
minimum, useful ambiguity can still be injected with things like
gender "pat", "morgan", and shorthand "ed (eddie, edward...)", "jane

Internet access is generally provisioned and billed as... choose
the max bandwidth you want, pay for it whether you use it or not.
Therefore if you have idle capacity within your max at some moment,
you have the bandwidth to dynamically fill it with padding at no
additional cost. It's not a question of buying more to use as fill,
it's about intelligently filling what you've already comfortably paid for.
The problem of observing when endpoints are sitting idle, or rx/tx,

If you're out to address governments that is. Corporations can benefit
from such guidance too, however since they usually don't have Pinkerton
tribunals of their own, odds of successfull fulfillment of market
contracts increase by addressing govt impediments at same time.
Jury nullification, even one not guilty forces a new trial which is a big
risk and pain in the ass for prosecution.
Establishing contracts for people to just take the day off and plead
not guilty to get a real hearing and possible trial for their stupid $150
revenue traffic ticket. There's nothing to lose by doing so.
Right now the system is counting *entirely* on frictionless pleading
guilty and paying out via credit card. The potential impact of well
blogged reports of successes here is enormous.
Paying people to hand out pamphlets about same on court steps.
And that's just educational possibilities at no cost to them.

When you ask your browser to show you cpunks.org,
your browser takes that name, asks your computer to
translate (resolve) that name into an IP address. Your
computer doesn't have the knowledge to do that so
it then in turn sends the question out to the nameservers
(resolvers) on the internet. They look up the name to IP
mapping in their tables and send the IP back to your computer
and browser which then turns around and connects back
out over the internet to that IP address (cpunks server) which
then sends the page back to your browser for display.
Under the hood the internet (routers) only know IP traffic,
so you need that translation layer if you want to punch
names into your browser bar instead of IP numbers.
While blockchainbdgpzk.onion is a name, .onion
names are based on crypto under the hood, not IP's,
and they're understood to belong to the Tor network,
not the internet network. (Even though Tor rides on
top of the internet somewhat like letters in sealed envelopes
through the post office.)
So just punching onions into your browser (which
ultimately only knows the IP based internet) should not
"work" unless you've installed software and modified
your system to support that.
If it does "work" and you're not aware that you've specifically
modified your system to do that, then you're under attack
and should seek help.

Is not the goal of AP to take out the mark, or at least to estimate
the perceived value in doing so. So whatever happens before or
after that to the bidder and contractor is irrelavent, they evaluated
their risks and endeavoured to conduct a mutually beneficial
transaction. If their evaluation of risk was not sound, that's their problem.
But for the transactions that do execute, the mark is still dead
and both goals have been met.
As Jim alluded, there is often a free speech component to any
non-executed prediction. And a market can be any number of markets
containing any number of offers, including 1 offer in each of 10 markets.
Some markets will see user traffic, others will be shutdown. Maybe some
will be purely p2p with reputation of makers and takers floating in signed
A side goal of AP is to put enough money into it such that people
do research, develop and deply a suitable marketplace that will
withstand investigation. Right now there are at least 10 viable darknet
markets offering a variety of sex, drugs, money, contraband, kopimi,
and guns... and business is booming by all accounts.
Actions up to and including murder aren't that much distant from

Internet firms to be banned from offering unbreakable encryption under new laws
3:16PM GMT 02 Nov 2015
Internet and social media companies will be banned from putting
customer communications beyond their own reach under new laws to be
unveiled on Wednesday.
Companies such as Apple, Google and others will no longer be able to
offer encryption so advanced that even they cannot decipher it when
asked to, the Daily Telegraph can disclose.
Measures in the Investigatory Powers Bill will place in law a
requirement on tech firms and service providers to be able to provide
unencrypted communications to the police or spy agencies if requested
through a warrant.

If they're pushing their miracle crypto code down into your
browser for execution, then it's garbage. So are all other
self proclaimed centralized corporate crypto services that
do the same thing, or force you to use their special client.
Because someday they will either be forced or subverted into
pushing bad code and compromising some user, quite possibly you.
Come back when you can install and pin down peer
reviewed third party crypto code in your browser,
or use any client that meets an open API spec they publish.
Better yet, support and use p2p storage and messaging instead
of central corporate services. Or at least do it locally
and store it on a few $5 shells if you need it online.
Nothing? Really? I'll bet anyone on these lists .1337 BTC they do.

To whom it may concern,
Markets are objects of censorship and always have been. There is a
presumed division, that renders commerce distinct from the notion of
free speech. But I will allege that the act of commerce is, itself,
indistinct from speech. Where or how one spends their value is a
decision as personal and poignant as any words ever spoken or letters
ever written.
As a unfortunate consequence of freedom, bad actors will engage in
repugnant trade that impinges upon the rights and freedoms of others.
It is the job of humanity to cooperate and see to it that trade, such
as this, becomes unprofitable. Whether it is accomplished through
technological achievement or through the adjustment of social mores,
or perhaps a simple appeal to the underlying natural law, it is not
the job of bad acting third parties to force into hiding commerce that
must be dealt with by means of an adjustment to the global, social
Cooperation, in the manner I was just speaking about, has never been
plausible until the invention of The Blockchain. I will not foist upon
Satoshi's humble creation such impracticable possibilities as the
achievement of world peace.
But in approaching Drop Zone, I am attempting to do nothing more than
what is possible and possibly more efficient than what exists. I wish
for Drop Zone to be nothing more than an appendage to The Blockchain.
As such, it is every bit as much Bitcoin as Bitcoin itself. Just as a
fungible Bitcoin enables the exchange of spaceless value with near
impunity, Drop Zone removes the ability of unwelcome parties from
glancing over the shoulders of those in the act of an exchange,
whatever it entails. This technology disrupts the ability of buyers to
gain insight into the identities or movements of suppliers making
supply chains far less vulnerable to disruption. It is this innovation
that separates this project from all other decentralized market
Whereas Bitcoin forces us to consider the nature of money and value,
Drop Zone will do the same for commerce. At its root, Bitcoin is a
message passing system. Those messages that are passed, unlike any
electronic message that's come before it, articulate value. Commerce
is, and has always been, similarly inclined toward message passing.
Whether in-person, over email, or through large, online shopping
carts, fundamentally, commerce is composed of messages that are in
service of the transaction wherein a final message of value is sent to
a recipient in exchange for a negotiated good or service. As such,
Drop Zone is a secure message passing protocol inasmuch as it is a
platform for commerce. And while the problem is far beyond the scope
or capabilities of the protocol in its most fundamental form, the
observant might even see the tenuous skeleton of a full-fledged
reputation system. Such a project is, in itself, as important and
difficult as any facing this decentralized ecosystem.
I hope that Drop Zone lets us all dream of a day when no man will any
longer be made to suffer indignity for simply engaging in unpopular or
stigmatized commerce. May all commerce be created equal.

the US should have just rebuilt the buildings identically
as a "fuck you" and moved on, but instead its govt...).
Anyway, what they really fear is that the populace as a
whole will wake up and rise up against their needless
structure, excess, and quiet enslavement. The real reason
they want to spy is to see, regarding them, what you're
thinking and up to, so they can head you off and remain
in power. This is exactly what all governments in history
have done, and the end is showing no signs of being
any different. Just more and more power, all to them,

Buried in the 300 pages of the draft Investigatory Powers Bill (aka
the Snooper's Charter), published on Wednesday, is something called a
"technical capability notice" (Section 189). Despite its
neutral-sounding name, this gives the UK's home secretary almost
unlimited power to impose "an obligation on any relevant
operators"—any obligation—subject to the requirement that "the
Secretary of State considers it is reasonable to do so."
There is also the proviso that "it is (and remains) practicable for
those relevant operators to comply with those requirements," which
probably rules out breaking end-to-end encryption, but would still
allow the home secretary to demand that companies add backdoors to
their software and equipment.
That's bad enough, but George Danezis, an associate professor in
security and privacy engineering at University College London, points
out that the Snooper's Charter is actually much, much worse.

Apple understands and successfully applies that. They put their UX

Assuming for example that Apple's phone crypto really is as good
as their word, then the only real weakness is whatever cheesy

strong 128 bit, insert a cryptokey, whatever... then it services

Then don't have your key signed, and or be a nym and sign those of
nyms you trust based on context, not on govts. Use of WOT is an
option there if you want it, not every use case of PGP needs it.
No, PGP is excellent, at what it does.  Like any other tool, it
fails when people foolishly try to make it do what it can't in
situations it shouldn't.  There is no blame on the tool there, only
upon the people stubbornly bashing their head trying to make it fit.
Continuing to talk about traditional SMTP transport services as
fixable by bolting on whatever... is futile, ignorant, and old.
All the people circlejerking on Metzdowd about designing crypto
fixes into existing SMTP models, and all the newfangled encrypted
webmail providers fall into that category.
Owning both ends hides the non-body elements, but you're not
hiding dns lookups, sizes, the fact that you hit send, etc.
It's not a new mail protocol that's needed, it's a whole
new messaging network.
No, this is a non option.
- Free providers are out for their own, like govts, they have no
real interest in their users going dark.
- Paid providers are a bit more loyal, but building that
and making statements about it entails risk of suit for failure
such that they're not really inclined. Most of them can't
even put postfix, dovecot and openldap together reliably and
scalably, let alone functional spam control and peering.
- You're still trusting your keys to the provider, and that the
provider won't be forced to jack you through your browser or
whatever cool software they give you. In today's world, that is
an abject failure.
As before:
Traditional centralized messaging services are a failure.  There
is NOTHING you can do to fix them but to replace them.  That is
where you have the chance to integrate crypto and defenses.  And the
only valid thing to replace them with now against the risk of centralization
and all but godlike attack is a new anonymous encrypted P2P messaging
transport system that scales [1].  You could create a new UI on all
the platforms, and for faster adoption encapsulate existing message
format within and extend existing clients to deal with the cryptographic
addressbooking and keep it Unix and business needs pipeliney. You
could include storage and nym registration. But at minimum you need
to shuffle messages between cryptographic endpoints within the net.
Anyways, you're wasting your time talking about PGPifying webmail,
desnooping and delogging SMTP, and poor little Johnny.
Forget about that tired old refit shit and build something new.
Put a little bling and sound effects in it, call it an IM, it worked

enough areas to begin to feel confident in assembling a handful of
them into such a system... even into a number of systems... messaging,
storage, info / data distribution, payments. But it will take all

(KPIX 5) — This might come as a surprise to California natives in
their 20s and early 30s: The state owns your DNA.
Every year about four million newborns in the U.S. get a heel prick at birth,
Danielle Gatto ... was shocked to find, her daughters’ leftover blood
was not thrown away. “The state collects the cards and then uses them
in a database,” she said.
Turns out a non-descript office building in Richmond contains the DNA
of every person born in California since 1983.
Law enforcement can request them. Private companies can buy them to do
research – without your consent. “Everybody has a right to make an
informed decision. That is not for the state to decide for them,” said
The CDPH turned down a request for an interview and wouldn’t explain
why it doesn’t ask permission to sell babies’ blood spots.
Yaniv Erlich with Columbia University and the New York Genome Center
... demonstrated how easy it is to take anonymized DNA,
cross-reference it with online data and connect it to a name. “You
need to have some training in genetics, but once you have that kind of
training the attack is not very complicated to conduct,”
But Gatto thinks the state should have to at least ask her consent
before storing and selling her daughters’ DNA. “We are at the
beginning of a frontier of so much genetic research, there is no
knowing at this point in time what that info could be used for,” said
Gatto. ‘The worst thing as a parent is to think that a decision that
you are making today may negatively affect your children down the
Gatto's husband – state Assemblyman Mike Gatto – introduced a bill
this year that would have required signed consent... Opposition from

Cpunk care about the sheeple, and their gripe is a legit frustration...
sheeple seem to be biologically unreachable regarding the risks
they face in this area.
Can anyone point out a successful strategy that has been used for
the cpunk to reach and enlighten them such that they make some sort
of change for themselves, or act to change their world?
Now look at a certain subset of sheeple... the NRA.  These folks
are built of the same sort as the average sheeple, but it is
discovered one thing that motivates and resonates them... guns, and
the surrounding rhetoric and issues.  And it so happens that they
also have a strong interest in privacy and dislike of government
nature. They mention against the NSA and spying and databases in
their convention speeches, you can find them on youtube. And their
political action call tree and fundraising is one to be reckoned
with. If cpunks would just reach out, these guys would be a close
symbiot army.  For example, if you show them your encrypted chat
app it's not long before lightbulb and they ask you "Wait, so you
mean I can talk shit with my buds about how many rounds of ammo I
got in the basement, moonshine, and that damn president we got...
all without the gubmint hearing me?" "Yep," you say, at which point
you've become instant friends.
Yet where is the cpunk set up with a booth at NRA conventions and
gun shows giving demos and handing out pamphlets???
The sheeple may be mostly hopeless cause, but there are various
groups that could be allied with in order to multiply cpunk numbers
to the level necessary to effect change.  Which ones and why?
The religious...
Doctor Patient...
Attorney Client...
Where is Cpunk focusing its efforts and getting results?
Wasting on Johnny who might not ever get it, or on cultivating a
symbiot army that will cause change and thus bring something new
to Johnny by default.

However these days, and really since day one, it has been known
that email bodies are only half the problem in the full threat model.
The other half is metadata. And now with them pushing code to

So please stop talking about what you're going to bolt on to fix

Which of course will always be answered "yes", where it happens makes
not difference. However value in the user brokering their own data out of
their own store, at least that way they have some small chance to retain

You rightly and smoothly integrated crypto into every existing app
so that people can use crypto. As with my Apple comment, that's
respectable, I believe smooth integration is possible such that it
ends up being used without much thought. So that's cool, and
But note the fatal error: "into every *existing* app".
There is no practical threat against crypto itself.
However we have serious threats to the privacy
once thought achievable with crypto alone...
rooted in the protocols and centralization of every *existing* app.
So privacy is now unsolvable with them still in the picture, no
matter what crypto you throw at it or how you throw it.
And if you integrate crypto into them as they exist
today, you become fucked forever [1]... because you've
just now given sheep the crypto they subliminally want in the back
of their head, and thus to them the problem is solved. But we know
it's not. It doesn't cover metadata nor misplace of trust in central
I say you must say fuck the current apps and hold
out the crypto integration for better replacements
that address those issues as well.
Otherwise it's still a soggy sandwich.

mass market win.

Exactly. Governments have had at least 15 years to strap those boots,

as interesting as USA vs. USSR in that regard... plots, schemes,
double and triple agents... the spy game.

consumer of electricity, especially since crypto in hardware.
Also note how if your personal electricity use has dropped but
your bill same or went up, doesn't matter what you use, they
tax you for what they want.
PKI like RSA has always been more costly than stream
like AES, so some auth and special marked stream overhead
isn't likely to save anything, because it's bloat.

References: <564EB197.7020207
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Hi TOR Mailing List People,
            I am apparently  the number one person in the United
States on the _*NSA-CIA-FBI Watch List*_. For multiple reasons! I am
the Coordinator of the United Front Against Racism and
Capitalism-Imperialism who was arrested by the so-called "Major Case
Squad" in August 1986 because our group exposed the scientific
documentation on a big series of _/*huge*/_ wall posters that AIDS is
Biological Warfare by the US Government Against Blacks, Gays and those
with certain blood dyscrasias. The arrest was on the front pages of
all NYC newspapers and on Channel 4 in Europe. I tried to send this
email to Anonymous and TOR does not permit attachments so just
disregard that when you see an attachment mentioned.
            Recently I was _*Extraordinarily Renditioned*_ (KIDNAPPED
AND HELD AGAINST MY WILL FOR 18 HOURS AND TORTURED after simply
walking along a road in New Jersey!) See the third attachment. The NSA
has TOTAL control of my computer and has real time keystroke by
keystroke monitoring and harassment while I am on the computer. My
anti-virus and anti-Malware are totally useless as explained by
Snowden because the computer is controlled through the _*BIOS Chip*_
as explained in the attachment on Snowden revelations. Scroll down the
document until you get to _*ANT*_ (Access Network Technology). I would
like for _*Anonymous*_ to publish on its website for EVERYONE, not
just me,  how to remove and neutralize NSA viruses placed on the BIOS
CHIP! Also please send the information in an email to me. I am sure
you could manage this. If THEY can do it and YOU are the world's
greatest hackers just like they are, then YOU can neutralize any
garbage they place on the BIOS Chip. Kaspersky by refusing to help me
in this also SUPPORTS NSA placement of virus software on the BIOS Chip
because that confirms that I am one of the capitalists' most important
enemies and therefore I am an are automatic enemy of Kaspersky. So I
can go screw! Will I receive the same response from Anonymous? It is a
rule of capitalist statecraft that a government control and operate
its own opposition by one means or another any and ALL means.
Anonymous is a supposed opposition group. So who is _/*really*/_
running anonymous and please do not say "everyone" or "no one" because
that is the same BS answer given by the anti-Communist Anarchist
group,  so-called "Occupy Wall Street." _*I need immediate help*_. And
so undoubtedly do others! I am partially computer savvy. But I am not
yet a programmer. Also, I am a Medical Doctor and a Theoretical
Astrophysicist and a Professional Revolutionary and have recently
finished writing an extremely important document completed after
almost 2 years of actual work: The _*Materialist Analysis of
Theoretical Astrophysics*_, which is a Classic of scientific,
political literature. As it states early on:
            "Though it is of a different genre from "On the Origin of
Species" by Charles Darwin and             "Zur Dynamik Bewegter
Korper" by Albert Einstein and the Einstein Field Equations
         which form the basis for the General Theory of Relativity it
sits on the same shelf
            because it defends all three and takes it further and
provides the answer to the ultimate                 question: What is
the truthful explanation of the Universe?"
            I could have added "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis
Bonaparte," by Karl Marx, which is a classic object lesson in applied
historical materialism. In any case we have to get rid of capitalism
or capitalism is going to get rid of us. _*A non-response from
Anonymous is a death sentence for the credibility of Anonymous.*_ You
can give me the information on how to get rid of a virus on the BIOS
chip or you can contact someone who DOES know how to do it. I will
remove it every day if I have to.
            Also I need help in publishing in some fashion the second
attached document. I do not want to hear "We are not your army?"
During the era when political postering was permitted in the United
States I spent over $50,000 of my own money on politics and the huge
posters which used to cover the walls of many US cities. Our AIDS
poster stopped all political postering in the United States by the
capitalist dictatorship of millionaires and billionaires. We are
living in End-Stage Capitalism. It is known as Rule by Decree, a form
of Bonapartism as in Napoleon Bonaparte. It is expressed a a military,
bureaucratic police state which is hardening by the day. "Democracy"
under capitalism is merely a codeword and a euphemism--both, they are
different--for capitalist dictatorship and enslavement here or
anywhere else in the world. We have to get rid of capitalism or
capitalism is going to get rid of us. Remember that capitalism is a
WORLD SYSTEM and so is Communism. Socialism, the first stage of
Communism has never ever actually been practiced anywhere and cannot
be practiced anywhere until capitalism is overthrown worldwide
starting at its center, the USA. We live in a a world of nation
states. All nation states are dictatorships of one class over another
class, either the capitalists over the Workers or vice versa. Because
of the 1988 Surrender by Gorbachev to the threat of a Nuclear War
there are a lot fewer Worker's States. We were almost there! In the
1930s we had a Million-Strong Communist-led Working Class Movement.
But they were deliberately misled to take a bribe known as the New
Deal. You don't think they came up with the New Deal out of the
goodness of their heart now do you? FDR was given credit then and more
recently on Cahnnel Thirteen Public Television for "Saving Capitalism
with the New Deal!" If that Million-Strong Communist-led Working Class
had not been deliberately misled to take that New Deal bribe there
would have been no Adolph Hitler, No WWII, No Korea, No Vietnam War
and ZERO of today's present problems. Look at the present world
situation! Ninety-Five Percent of New Yorkers and the overwhelming

Former NSA whistleblowers contend that the agency shut down a program
that could have "absolutely prevented" some of the worst terror
attacks in memory. According to the ZDNet story: "Weeks prior to the
September 11 terrorist attacks, a test-bed program dubbed ThinThread
was shut down in favor of a more expensive, privacy-invasive program
that too would see its eventual demise some three years later -- not
before wasting billions of Americans' tax dollars. Four
whistleblowers, including a congressional senior staffer, came out
against the intelligence community they had served, after ThinThread.
designed to modernize the agency's intelligence gathering effort, was
cancelled. Speaking at the premier of a new documentary film A Good
American in New York, which chronicles the rise and demise of the
program, the whistleblowers spoke in support of the program, led by
former NSA technical director William Binney."

On Encryption and Terrorists
Nov 23, 2015
In light of the recent terrorist attacks, things are getting heated
for the regular security and encryption software developer.  Being one
myself, I’ve been on the receiving end of a small avalanche of
requests from journalists, political pundits and even law enforcement.
I’m also someone who was born and raised in Beirut and who recently
immigrated to Paris, both of which were the sites of twin attacks, one
day apart from each other.
It seems necessary to share some perspective on what’s going on with
encryption software, the terrorists supposedly using it, and what this
means for the rights and the security of our global communities.
The encryption software community writes a large variety of software,
from secure instant messaging to flight tower communication management
to satellite collision prevention.  We do this for a number of
reasons, but there’s always an underlying shared understanding: that
we’re using mathematics and engineering to contribute towards a
society that’s safer, more capable and able to communicate with a
sense of privacy and dignity inherent to all modern societies.  The
premise driving the people writing encryption software is not exactly
that we’re giving people new rights or taking some away: it’s the hope
that we can enforce existing rights using algorithms that guarantee
your ability to free speech, to a reasonable expectation of privacy in
your daily life.  When you make a credit card payment or log into
Facebook, you’re using the same fundamental encryption that, in
another continent, an activist could be using to organize a protest
against a failed regime.
In a way, we’re implementing a fundamental technological advancement
not dissimilar from the invention of cars or airplanes.  Ford and
Toyota build automobiles so that the entire world can have access to
faster transportation and a better quality of life.  If a terrorist is
suspected of using a Toyota as a car bomb, it’s not reasonable to
expect Toyota to start screening who it sells cars to, or to stop
selling cars altogether.
And yet, this is the line of questioning that has besieged the
cryptography community immediately after the Paris attacks.  A simple
mention of my encryption software in an Arabic-speaking forum is
enough to put me on the receiving end of press inquiries such as “are
you aware of any terrorists using your software?  Do you feel it’s
your responsibility to monitor terrorist activity?”  Or, more bluntly,
do I feel like I’m complicit in aiding terrorists, by the simple fact
that I write cryptography software or currently do PhD research in
applied cryptography?
The brouhaha that has ensued from the press has been extreme.  I’ve
received calls that bluntly want to interview me regarding “technology
used by terrorists, such as yours.”  A Wired article, like many
alongside it, finds an Arabic PDF guide on encryption and immediately
attributes it as an “ISIS encryption training manual” even though it
was written years ago by Gaza activists with no affiliation to any
jihadist group.
In this rush to blame a field that is largely unknowable to the public
and therefore at once alluring and terrifying, little attention has
been paid to facts: The Paris terrorists did not use encryption, but
coordinated over SMS, one of the easiest to monitor methods of digital
communication.  They were still not caught, indicating a failure in
human intelligence and not in a capacity for digital surveillance.
But even in light of all the evidence pointing towards a human
intelligence failure, cryptography, being to the outsider a scary and
mysterious usage of secret codes and complicated algorithms, remains
an easy target.  The press again drives the discussion, each time with
a lessened priority for measured questioning and proper investigation.
Why haven’t you inserted back doors into your software?  Do you want
terrorists to use your tools?
The call for backdoors is nothing new.  During my career in the
private sector, I’ve seen requests to backdoor encryption software so
as to please potential investors, and have seen people in the field
who appeared to stand for secure software balk under the excuse of “if
that’s what the customer wants,” even if it results in irreparable
security weaknesses.  I’ve had well-intentioned intelligence officers
ask me informally, out of honest curiosity, why it is that I would
refuse to insert backdoors.  The issue is that cryptography depends on
a set of mathematical relationships that cannot be subverted
selectively.  They either hold completely or not at all.  It’s not
something that we’re not smart enough to do; it’s something that’s
mathematically impossible to do.  I cannot backdoor software
specifically to spy on jihadists without this backdoor applying to
every single member of society relying on my software.
And I’ve seen what guarantees secure communication can give a society.
I’ve seen my software used in Hong Kong to organize protests against a
government otherwise unwilling to give people their rights.  I’ve seen
my colleagues produce software used by Egyptians rallying for
democracy.  I’ve had childhood friends call me from Beirut, desperate
to know of a way to organize protests against a government that would
lock them up were they to use public phone lines.  I’ve set up
communication lines for LGBTQ organizations so that they can give
counsel without fearing ostracization or reprisal.  And in the comfort
of my new life in France, I’ve also relied on encryption so that I
know I’m obtaining my simple right to privacy when discussing my daily
life with my friends or with my partner.
I’ve come to see encryption as the natural extension a computer
scientist can give a democracy.  A permeation of the simple assurance
that you can carry out your life freely and privately, as enshrined in
the constitutions and charters of France, Lebanon as well as the
United States.  To take away these guarantees doesn’t work.  It
doesn’t produce better intelligence.  It’s not why our intelligence
isn’t competing in the first place.  But it does help terrorist groups
destroy the moral character of our politics from within, when out of
fear, we forsake our principles.
If we take every car off the street, every iPhone out of people’s
pockets and every single plane out of the sky, it wouldn’t do anything
to stop terrorism.  Terrorism isn’t about means, but about ends.  It’s
not about the technology but about the anger, the ignorance that holds
a firm grip over the actor’s mind.
I grew up and spent a decade of my childhood in south Beirut and was
literally neighbors with the security sector of Hezbollah, a guerilla
organization that fights frequent wars with Israel.  During the 2006
war, an Israeli fighter jet carpet-bombed the entire neighborhood,
razing my home and that of many others to the ground.  While walking
through a field of rubble and unexploded cluster bombs to try and find
my house, I distantly saw a friend of mine, far away on the other side
of whatever it was that I was staring across.  We locked eyes.  Then,
we burst out laughing.  We laughed for a long time.
In 2008, I got the opportunity to move away from Lebanon and to get an
education abroad.  This opportunity was rare and unusual.  Making
encryption software is hard, too: for many of my first years abroad,
much of my software was riddled with bugs, and it took practice and
feedback in order to start getting things right ­ namely, what my
education abroad of Lebanon really was about.
Visiting south Beirut a few years later, I found that I had changed
but that no one else there had.  The rubble was mostly but not
completely gone.  I also found that people were angry, and that
Hezbollah had pledged to rebuild their homes.  Left without any hope
for a good education, for a happy life, with much of their families
missing, with their friends dead, many pledged themselves in return.
That’s what’s causing terrorism, not encryption software.

Every government ever tried in past history has been a failure.
Many governments in current history are no more than tweaks
on the past and are thus doomed to failure in time. The ones
that aren't tweaks have questionable prospects at coming close
to the 1200+ years of Ancient Rome (which failed). The US is
bankrupt and pissed away all it's political and other capital
the last 15 years and is now being eclipsed by Communists
(a large part of bRiCs), lol. The history of government is failure.
In the future, try doing without. The worst you're get is failure,
which is no loss because odds-wise that's what you're in already,
and likely to choose by default on any reboot... do you really
want to subject your great X 10^n grandkids to that cycle again?

Sorry, but debt is supposed to be something incurred in a time of need
which you are generally able to repay in a mutually acceptable timeframe.
When you start pushing 100yr schedules, you're approaching lifetimes
of humans and govts themselves, funny that structuring ;-)
The US can't repay $18T to anyone in 10 or 25 or maybe even 50 years
without cutting everything else it does to near zero. And that doesn't
include it's unfunded liablilties.
And for the idiots out there... paying debt out of, or mooting debt
via, "growth"
is unrealistic... the geopolitical competitive status (and the closed
cycle nature
of) the planet precludes that kind of growth. Interest rates are backwards,
housing is still rape, etc. Economists these days have to be liek WTF bro?

It will have to get seriously fubar before it does.

TPB is a long since sold and sold out third party joke of what it once was.
Moreover, Iceland, Sweden, whatever for TPB itself... it never protected
users, because torrenting protocol the clearnet cannot protect users.
For that, torrenters MUST rehome themselves exclusively to the darknets.
I2P and Phantom and even Tor and so forth would work reasonably well
for that against corporate MAFIAA attacks. But torrenters are stupid.
And it is the role of cpunks to provide designs for such capable darknets.
Yes, on I2P and Tor, lol. But note, save maybe openbazaar P2P alikes,
people are vain, so real P2P is not popular for them to do as it removes
their fame and control via their would be central sevices. This is why real
P2P hasn't taken off. Imagine a truly P2P Uber / Lyft... it doesn't exist
because everyone who thinks it up wants a cut, at which point they
are middlemen and not true [anon] P2P.
Blah blah blah. How many and which treaties and partnerships, both front
and backdoor and silent, are Iceland's Government and country party to?
How strong is your adversary? Oh, now you have a problem once
you strip off the Iceland publicity bullshit. If Iceland were something
special you'd see them openly advertising forbidden hosting, not necessarily
for themselves, but for foreigners. And if it were a free country internally,
they'd advertise it for themselves. Silly laws, and mores. Ain't no bases
Real independant legal shit is seriously fucking hard to achieve.

The thread was intended about cyber operators... people moving
around with backpacks (or on wheels) with wifi, cell, laptops,
rf gear, buttsets, cabling tools, blackbag physical entry, etc,
or even info operators.. chasing valuable paper, keys, objects,

kidnap / ransom, or any plain old street thing where "shots"
or other direct in person action with / against other humans
are involved.
Cyber doesn't have much of that beyond social engineering,

conveniently ignore the fact that companies and the government can
already share information with each other as is. There were barely any
actual cybersecurity experts who were for the bill. A large group of
respected computer scientists and engineers were against it. So were
cyberlaw professors. Civil liberties groups uniformly opposed (and

i just want to share the news that all of the hard work that has gone
into the library freedom project paid off today at kilton library.
despite pressure from the us federal government, which pulled out every
card to sell fear that they had in their hat, the local community
refused to accept it and thought on a global level to support the
library's choice to offer a tor relay to the public.
this is truly a monumental moment. libraries in the usa have often been
the target of hostile actions that threaten the first amendment of the
us constitution and the privacy rights of people. through a long string
of legal battles, libraries have earned an extraordinary position that
provides them with the ability to offer services that could land other
people in significant legal battles which become both legally and
politically difficult to close down.
i'd just like to say thank you to everyone involved in the library
freedom project who came up with the idea and didn't run away from the
fight. this is an excellent beginning.
if you can, please send your support to the library freedom project.
this is a great victory for today.

References: ---------- Forwarded message ----------
FYI --
This is my OCR'd version of the National Security Council memo leaked
to the Washington Post and available at the link below.  The pdf of
the original looks like it was typed on a *manual* typewriter -- the
NSC clearly following the lead of Russia to avoid being intercepted
electronically!  [The irony of the NSC using a manual typewriter for a
memo on encryption is truly delicious!]
The most distressing part of this memo is its obscene disregard for
the Constitution.  The only "stakeholders" -- according to this NSC
memo -- in favor of "civil liberties" and "human rights" seem to be
organizations -- e.g., the EFF and the ACLU; ordinary citizens are
apparently not "stakeholders", and have no "stake" in this discussion.
Of course, every time someone uses the term "stakeholder", the only
images that come to mind are those scenes from black-and-white horror
movies in which the townspeople are chasing a vampire with wooden
stakes that they intend to drive through his heart!
REVIEW OF STRATEGIC APPROACHES
Option 1: Disavow Legislation and Other Compulsory Actions
Engagement Strategy and timeline
Z September: Outreach to foreign allies to signal our strong
resistance to efforts to compel access; outreach to U.S. industry, the
technology community, and civil society to coordinate messaging;
attempt to convince other allies to come out with a similar statement
at the same time.
Z October: The President issues a statement strongly disavowing
legislation or other efforts to compel access and calling on U.S.
industry to resist efforts by other nations to compel access;
coordinated industry and civil society statements of support;
coordinated foreign partner statements of agreement.
Z November: Outreach to other governments to bring more allies in
alignment with our position; outreach to U.S. industry to build
voluntary cooperation in the absence of compulsion; host public
discussions and debates on encryption policy with U.S. industry and
foreign allies.
Top Line Message
Z The problem of criminals using strong encryption to frustrate law
enforcement's information gathering is a real and growing problem but
we have not found a secure, practical solution.
Z People around the world rely on the security of U.S. products and
services in their daily lives.  Mandating the design of those systems
to include known vulnerabilities makes all of us less safe and
undermines trust in these digital services.
Z It is critical that law enforcement be able to access the
information that it needs to protect public safety and national
security.  We will continue to use all of the tools available to us
lawfully to keep American citizens safe.
Z Overall, the benefits to privacy, civil libertine, and cybersecurity
gained from encryption outweigh the broader risks that would have been
created by weakening encryption.
Z Accordingly, the Administration will not seek legislation that
compels providers to design their products to enable government access
to encrypted information, even pursuant to lawful process.
Z We expect that foreign governments will also take a hard look at
this difficult issue, and hope that they will come to the same
conclusion.  We call on U.S. industry to resist efforts by other
governments to mandate such access.
Impact on Policy Equities
Public Safety and National Security.  In the near term, this approach
would not provide any relief to law enforcement efforts to counter the
increasing use of encryption by criminals, including terrorists.  As a
result, the public safety drawbacks would be significant, though the
precise extent of the drawback versus other proposals is unclear
because bad actors will increasingly be able to frustrate law
enforcement efforts to access their communications through lawful
process.  This approach would remove technology companies' most
consistent grievance with the Administration, which could improve
cooperation across a range of important priorities on technology
issues including, but not limited to, encryption.  It may also foster
better cooperation on information that is not encrypted and will not
fracture the Internet products and services market which may also
preserve better access to unencrypted information, thus aiding public
safety/national security.
Cybersecurity.  Pro-encryption statements from the government could
also encourage broader use of encryption, which would also benefit
global cybersecurity.  Further, because any new access point to
encrypted data increases risk, eschewing mandated technical changes
ensures the greatest technical security.  At the same time, the
increased use of encryption could stymie law enforcement's ability to
investigate and prosecute cybercriminals, though the extent of this
threat over any other option is unclear as sophisticated criminals
will use inaccessible encryption.
Economic Competitiveness.  This approach could help undercut foreign
competitors' criticisms that U.S. companies' products are instruments
of U.S. mass surveillance, and would clearly differentiate U.S. policy
from moves by China and others to mandate decryption.  However, if
other markets do not follow our lead, and instead demand access, it is
more difficult to assess the impact of this approach.  On the one
hand, U.S. companies could be forced to avoid those markets or develop
access solutions.  On the other, the failure of some nations to follow
the U.S. lead could bolster the reputation of the United States as a
leading source of technically secure products and.  services.
Civil Liberties and Human Rights.  Domestically, many privacy and
civil liberties advocates would regard this approach as a significant
step in defense of privacy and free expression around the world.  If
other nations follow our lead or companies successfully resist country
demands, this approach could limit repressive regimes' willingness to
demand access to encrypted information, which likely would help
protect dissidents and other communities in danger of human rights
Likely Reaction of Key Stakeholders
Industry and Civil Society.  This sector would strongly support this approach.
Other Governments.  Likely to be divided.  This position would
contradict the stated policy of some allies (e.g., the United Kingdom,
France, and the Netherlands) who argue that governments should not
allow “safe spaces” for extremists.  As a result, those allies could
criticize the U.S. position as endangering the safety of their
citizens.  Other foreign partners that are strong advocates for free
expression online and have not argued for government access to
encrypted information (e.g., Germany and Estonia) are more likely to
support this approach.
Z Some in industry have indicated that a strong statement disavowing
legislation is a precondition to voluntary cooperation with the United
States Government.  Since the prospects of legislation are dim, this
approach could help build cooperation without limiting broader policy
Z Counters the narrative that the United States is seeking to expand
its surveillance capability at the expense of cybersecurity, and could
help repair trust in the United States Government and U.S. companies
Z A strong statement from the United States could make it more
difficult for authoritarian regimes to seek compulsory legislation,
although working group participants are divided on whether adopting
this approach would actually stop such calls.
Z May weaken future calls for data localization since it will be
harder for other countries to claim they are “protecting” their
citizens' data from the United States.
Z Could provide some positive benefit for U.S. negotiations on the
U.S.-EU Data Protection and Privacy Agreement, Safe Harbor, and
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
Z Is the strongest option for cybersecurity, economic competitiveness
and civil liberties and human rights.
Z This approach provides no immediate solution to the challenges that
the expanding use of encryption poses to law enforcement and national
security today and is the weakest option from that perspective.
Z Some working group participants argue this approach would remove a
key point of leverage -- the threat of legislation in our negotiations
with industry (although few, if any, in industry likely find this
threat to be credible).
Z U.S. providers have not indicated they would be willing to
voluntarily modify their systems to enable law enforcement access to
encrypted information, even if the government were to eschew
legislation, and could result in the United States being isolated in
its position.
Option 2: Defer on Legislation and Other Compulsory Actions
This option could be pursued with two distinct goals in mind.  Under
option 2(a), the Administration would seek industry's voluntary
assistance to modify their technology to address law enforcement's
concerns.  Under option 2(b), the Administration would accept the
current status quo and not seek technical modifications, but would
still ask providers to assist law enforcement in any way that they can
within their current technological framework.  In either case, these
calls for assistance could be done publicly or privately, depending on
the preferred engagement framework.
Engagement Strategy and Timeline
Z September: Outreach to foreign allies to assess their positions;
signal to allies that the United States does not think legislation is
the right way forward at this time; work with other governments to
identify voluntary action by industry that would help to mitigate
their concerns; outreach to U.S. industry to coordinate messaging.
Z October: The President issues a statement disavowing legislation,
but acknowledges the serious challenges posed by encryption for public
safety and national security; secure coordinated statements of support
or agreement from industry, civil society, and partner nations.
Z October-November: Outreach to foreign allies in the wake of the
statement to bring more allies in alignment with our position;
outreach to U.S. industry to build voluntary cooperation in the
absence of compulsion; if some allies persist in demanding access,
consider whether the United States Government should highlight the
difference in positions and the U.S. emphasis on privacy-protections.
Z Post-November: Host public discussions on encryption policy with
U.S. industry and foreign allies; should foreign allies demand and
secure access, consider whether to call upon U.S. industry to provide
the same access to the United States Government.
Top Line Message
Z The United States is not seeking legislation at this time to compel
providers to change their products to enable government access to
encrypted information pursuant to lawful process.
Z At this point, legislation appears neither feasible or easily
draftable.  We need considerable public discussion before we would be
in position to contemplate a legislative solution.
Z However, we also cannot ignore the barriers that inaccessible
encryption can create to law enforcement's critical need to
investigate and prosecute criminals, including terrorists -- and the
threat these barriers create for public safety.
Impact on Policy Equities
Public Safety and National Security.  Does not reverse the long- term
trend of increasing use of encrypted technologies by criminals, but
could open potential avenues for cooperation with industry, without
removing all law enforcement leverage (although working group
participants disagree on whether calling for legislation will provide
meaningful leverage).  Some working group participants, however, have
indicated they think it unlikely that industry will be willing to
voluntarily modify their technology -- even if the threat of
legislation is removed.  This suggests that Option 2(a), in which the
Administration would seek such technical modifications, is unlikely to
succeed.  However, unlike option 1, it retains flexibility on the
approach should the public safety picture deteriorate to overtake
competing equities.  This approach would also make compromise with
foreign governments not currently seeking legislation easier, but
would still provide some help in resisting attempts by
 governments like China to use encryption policies to skew markets or
oppress citizens by retaining strong public statements (e.g., “will
not seek legislation”).
Cybersecurity.  Could encourage the use of more encryption, which
would likely be good for cybersecurity.  If a statement under this
approach is perceived as positive but not sufficiently strong,
however, this could be less successful in forestalling other nations
from pursuing encryption-weakening measures.  Also, because any access
point to encrypted data increases risk, if government efforts to
secure access are successful, this approach would reduce
cybersecurity.  However, the degree of impact on cybersecurity would
vary significantly, and could be great or small, depending on the
specific policy and technical decisions.
Economic Competitiveness.  Could have a positive, though incomplete,
effect in removing barriers to Administration engagement with the tech
sector on this issue.  Removing the prospect of United States
Government calls for legislation would likely have positive effects on
international competitiveness.  If long-term successful in gaining
government access, this option would significantly harm economic
competitiveness though the harm might be somewhat mitigated if there
was broad international success in getting government access.
Civil Liberties and Human Rights.  Some will be dissatisfied with lack
of outright disavowal, but may appreciate the pragmatic recognition of
the practical limitations of a mandated approach.  However, others
almost certainly will continue to have concerns about government
access to encrypted information being used to suppress dissident
populations.  Should some companies cooperate voluntarily and enable
government access, the United States Government will need to accept
that other nations -- including some repressive ones -- will use this
access as well.
Likely Reaction of Key Stakeholders
Industry and Civil Society.  Although industry and civil society may
be less positive to this approach than a hardline disavowal, those
communities would likely see this outcome as a solid win.  However,
further government pressure on industry to build access into their
products would likely generate negative reactions.  Therefore, it is
likely that Industry and Civil Society would have a much better
reaction to Option 2(b), which does not seek technical modifications,
than to Option 2(a), which does.
Other Governments.  Allied governments that prefer an access regime
may push back on the core U.S. message.  However, those governments
likely would react more positively to this approach than a complete
disavowal of government access to encrypted information.
Z Responds to a key ask from industry, although industry might prefer
a stronger statement.  To the extent that industry is satisfied with
the strength of the statement, this approach could help build
cooperation without limiting broader policy options.
Z Could help counter the narrative that the United States is seeking
to expand its surveillance capability, and help repair trust in the
United States and U.S. companies overseas.
Z Could allow the United States to serve as a broker between
pro-access allies (e.g., United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands),
and U.S. industry, which could mitigate some demands from foreign
partners and ensure U.S. companies do not have to build multiple
access regimes.
Z If long-term successful in gaining government access, this option
would help public safety and national security.
Z Could lead to disparate approaches by governments to the encryption
issue, leading to more or different compliance regimes that U.S.
companies will need to comply with, which could have a negative effect
on their economic competitiveness.
Z Does not provide an immediate solution to the challenges that the
expanding use of encryption poses to law enforcement.  Without a
disavowal of legislation, many U.S. technology companies in the long
term likely will not pursue voluntary design changes in products and
services to enable access for law enforcement.
Z If long-term successful in gaining government access, this option
would harm cybersecurity, economic competitiveness and civil liberties
and human rights.
Option 3: Remain Undecided on Legislation or Other Compulsory Actions
Engagement Strategy and Timeline
Z September: Outreach to foreign allies to assess their positions;
Private outreach to key industry leaders to argue that we need a more
fulsome policy discussion before we decide how to proceed.
Z October: Organize or participate in closed-door, small group
discussions with U.S. industry to facilitate a more in-depth policy
discussion.  At the same time, organize bilateral and multilateral
conversations with foreign partners to discuss the challenges and how
to proceed.
Z November: High-level Administration statement highlights initial
discussions, outlines key challenges, distills a few key questions and
principals, and announces a meeting or series of meetings (potentially
both domestic and international) to discuss and debate these key
Z December: After the discussions, reassess our position and determine
whether to take a position on encryption legislation or to continue to
call for discussion.
Top Line Message
Z The President has said that there is no situation in which you
wouldn't want strong encryption.
Z At the same time, there are situations in which the government
cannot obtain information related to a specific potential national
security threat.  If there is not a way of accessing that information
and protecting the American public, then the Administration believes
need to have a public debate.
Z Having a broad discussion about this is essential -- over the next
several months, [we or several entities] will host discussions on the
challenges posed by encryption and how we can best address them.  I
would urge everyone to participate.
Impact on Policy Equities
Public Safety and National Security.  This approach has, to date,
failed to incentivize cooperation with law enforcement.  It could in
the long-term sway public opinion to create greater responsiveness --
particularly while the government retains the leverage resulting from
the threat of legislation.  On the other hand, silence on our part
could encourage foreign governments to control the agenda.  They might
pressure U.S. industry to provide lawful access, which, if successful,
would make it easier for us to require similar accommodations.  This
approach could also encourage companies to continue to aggressively
pursue developing inaccessible encrypted services, and could make
future cooperation significantly more challenging.  Therefore, it is
hard to predict the impact that this approach would have on public
Cybersecurity.  Although it would not actively conflict with our
message on the importance of encryption to cybersecurity, the
uncertainty of public perceptions about the government's position
could perpetuate distrust in encryption technologies related to the
United States Government, and could undermine the effectiveness of the
National Institute of Standards and Technology and other entities at a
time when our cybersecurity agenda is already at risk.  If long-term
successful in gaining government access, this option would harm
cybersecurity.  -
Economic Competitiveness.  This approach does little to counter
current distrust of the government by industry or foreign competitors.
Further, by not taking a position on legislation in either direction,
this approach does little to shape the reactions of other governments,
increasing the risk that they will splinter into multiple camps,
presenting U.S. industry with fractured markets.  Therefore, this
approach is likely harmful for economic competitiveness.
Civil Liberties and Human Rights.  Because this approach would likely
not stop -- and could encourage -- other nations from demanding
access, it is likely harmful for the Administration's efforts on civil
Likely Reaction of Key Stakeholders
Industry/Civil Society.  Will likely continue to strongly object until
the United States Government explicitly eschews compulsory
legislation.  As time passes, if we continue to fail to take a
position, industry and civil society positions will likely harden as
people perceive our silence as an implicit endorsement of legislation.
As a result, the United States Government risks losing credibility if
it fails to participate robustly in a public debate and with a unified
voice.  There is also a risk that industry chooses not to participate
in meetings on the subject and escalates lobbying and public relations
Other Governments.  Allied governments that seek access will prefer
this approach to either of the approaches that come out against
compulsory legislation, and will likely see this as an opportunity for
them to press for legislation themselves.
Z Provides flexibility to course correct and negotiate with U.S.
industry and our foreign allies.
Z Retains a key negotiating chip (the threat of legislation) in our
engagement with industry (although few, if any, in industry find this
threat credible).
Z If other governments call for legislation and/or compel companies to
change their encryption solutions to enable better access in the
meantime, this could provide us with cover to use that same access.
Z Delays establishing a coherent Administration position, which could
result in: (1) the United States being portrayed as increasingly
ineffective/unable to resolve this challenge; (2) disputes among
departments and agencies bleeding out into public discussion; (3) U.S.
industry continuing to have challenges operating overseas (although it
is unclear that a pro-encryption statement would by itself address
this challenge); and (4) public and foreign government positions may
harden in the absence of an affirmative U.S. position, limiting our
ability to influence the global debate.
Z Does not provide an immediate solution to the challenges that the
expanding use of encryption poses to law enforcement.  Moreover, this
approach does not resolve the current policy debate.  The United
States Government likely will be faced with this same discussion again
in several months' time.

References: ---------- Forwarded message ----------
Timeline of Events of Note
1992 - DES is broken cryptanalytically, although with an attack
greater than the birthday bound
1993 - SHA released, based on MD4/MD5
1995 - SHA-1 revised, original SHA now called SHA-0
1998 - Skipjack Released
1999 - Impossible Differential Analysis breaks 31 of 32 rounds
2001 - SHA-2 released, by Threefish's standards, a 256-round hash function
2005 - SHA-1 is broken by a non-practical attack, spurs SHA-3 competition
2010 - Xie and Feng announce a one block collision on MD5, which they
cannot release for _security reasons._
The occasional cryptanalytic success implies that the NSA is generally
more advanced, but not always. Cryptanalytic success seems to be a
random process, but it requires previous successes to exist. The NSA
seems to be more advanced than the Chinese, and the Chinese vaguely
more advanced than the remaining cryptographic community. This can
probably be attributed to the fact that the NSA has more money, has
the support of other SIGINT agencies in cryptanalysis, and thus
probably have half the world's mathematicians. Thus perhaps the NSA
has a 42% chance of getting a genuinely new cryptanalytic success, the
Chinese a 33%, and the rest of the world a 25% chance.
The evidence to support such a claim is that impossible differential
analysis nearly broke Skipjack, although maybe the NSA was aware of it
and had less concerns about security margins than we think. Further
attacks on SHA-1 and SHA-2 spurred the SHA-3 competition. While it was
reasonable for the civilian cryptographic community to be concerned,
the fact that the NSA was concerned is telling. It was a result they
did not predict, and they possibly thought further cryptanalysis could
break those two hash functions.
Fortunately there is a large body of research on the cost efficiency
of research programs. While one may conclude that the NSA must
perpetually be making leaps and bounds ahead of everyone through the
virtues of compound interest, the answer is pleasanter. There is a
diseconomy of scale when it comes to research. For instance, the Moon
program or the Manhattan project could have been cheaper if more time
was allotted for its completion.  Given that the nature of research
changes over time as the easiest results are exhausted, and that large
organizations do have waste, it is safe to say that any gap between
NSA and civilian cryptography will shrink by a small extent, year over

FBI: Weaker Encryption Is a Worthwhile Tradeoff for Law Enforcement
Access to Data
Government officials sparred with privacy advocates over encryption,
but acknowledged that “back doors” come with risks of intrusion.
Kaveh Waddell September 15, 2015
The Justice Department and the FBI are continuing their campaign to
convince the tech community and the public that weakening encryption
to allow law enforcement to access encrypted communications and data
has its risks, but that the drawbacks are outweighed by the security
Amy Hess, the executive assistant director of FBI’s science and
technology branch, said at a Christian Science Monitor discussion that
allowing access to encrypted messages to anyone other than the sender
or the receiver comes with “some risk” of intrusion.  But because law
enforcement must be able to read encrypted data and communication to
do its job, the risk of third-party access is acceptable, Hess said,
as long as it is minimized.
The Justice Department—-and especially the FBI—-has clashed with the
technology community over the agency’s demands that online platforms
stay away from encryption practices that keep data private even from
the platforms themselves.  If the communications service cannot access
the data sent across its servers, it cannot turn the data over to law
Law enforcement has called on tech companies to take the lead in
developing an encryption standard that is both secure and accessible
to authorities upon request.  Last week, FBI Director James Comey said
technology experts just need to “try harder” to find a solution.
But experts maintain that such a standard is impossible to achieve,
because any third-party key for unlocking encrypted data—-even if
reserved for extreme circumstances—-will be vulnerable to hackers.
A company that builds vulnerabilities into its encryption becomes an
attractive target of attack to foreign governments, criminal hackers,
and “drooling teenagers in basements,” said Matt Blaze, a noted
cryptography expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
Because companies are increasingly turning to stronger encryption, the
FBI is running out of tools to fight crime, Hess said Tuesday.  A
request for a wiretap—-one of the most powerful surveillance tools
available to the FBI—-is a long and complicated process that requires
an agent to supply an extensive affidavit stating that every
less-intrusive method of surveillance had already been considered or
applied, according to Kiran Raj, Senior Counsel to the Deputy Attorney
But Hess said FBI agents will not apply for wiretaps if they think a
suspect is using encrypted communication, because they are not willing
to expend the time and cost of crafting the request if the odds of its
success are slim.
The FBI’s claim was largely met with a shrug from privacy advocates.
“A warrant is not a right that the government has to get data,” said
Jon Callas, CEO of Silent Circle, a company that builds encrypted
communications platforms.  “It is a right to perform a search, to
attempt to get the data, and there may be a lot of reasons why it
can’t get to it.”
But even as privacy advocates clashed with law enforcement officials
onstage over the form encryption should take in the tech community,
the groups said they both have the same objective—security—in mind.
“The polarization of this debate is really harmful,” Blaze said.  “I
think that in terms of the end goals, there’s a lot more common ground
here than maybe the debate lets on.”

Subsistance is the correct level, possibly less, but no more.
The makeup / more comes from work in your areas of interest.
Subsistance is also trends pointless status quo, which is fine if you

Hi Tor Talkers,
i saw the bags of  and the general problem for a Tor
ExitNode at home
the thoughts
why don't you put it to a drone or two, one drone to do the ExitNode
and the second for the solar power?
that couldn't be that heavy a drone can't carry even when you can add
a chainsaw to a drone
Flying chainsaw
or to lift 33kg/72,7Lb beer
Heavy Lift 1135mm 33kg Hobby King Beer Lift
the drone(s) must not fly all the time if you have a place it/they
could stay put and out of reach (that avoids the noise the drones
make, too) if you look a bit paranoia do a alarm system on it so you
get a notice if your drones get touched
maybe you can extend the distance with some literally bridges like
depending on the country you need a license to fly a drone or/and an
insurance or/and to be a member of an air/flying association to cover
the damage your drone might do to others when it isn't that save for
the drone during a windstorm
another thought is more handycrafty
put the exit node in a thing that fits in the surroundings outside the
home (stone, tree, grass) with a 3D printer you easily get the best
there is a library project, too
at last they need more popularity
Faced with police and city concerns, library director Fleming agreed
to turn off the Tor relay temporarily until the board could
reconsider. “We need to find out what the community thinks,” he said.
“The only groups that have been represented so far are the Police
Department and City Hall.”
Jacob did some Tor Exits in museum, i heard of.
perhaps some churches , art galleries or med clinics will spend asyl
for Tor, too.
the church kopimism will do that, i suppose so.
The Church, based in Sweden, has been officially recognized by the
Swedish Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency as a
religious community, after three application attempts.
perhaps there are other Tor user/exitnods protective synergetic
effects by the one or other constitution. so the time you spend to
avoid law enforcement at home you could spend to persuade someone but
the person must do that on free will not while you have induced your
will to the person.

to some dead google group, till finding this place to
post his Rus-Aus etc stuff. This is not a personal swat
at Zenaan (or anyone else), he (and they) are surely
fine folks all around. And such posts are in fact interesting
to interested readers.
But instead is a note that there do need to be other places,
and referrals to such, where such things are ontopic and
uncensored, such that they may call them home.
Unfortunately, unless such posts here make reference
back to a somehow crypto, cpunk, c-tech, c-law context...
they're offtopic.
And frequently violating that should be expected to bring fire...
to the point that the violating author will be silently killfiled,
thus nullifying themselves.

The computer-science professors, cryptographers, and digital-rights
advocates who had beaten back similar demands in the 1990s experienced
deja vu. That series of fights, which they called the “Crypto Wars,”
had only been the first round of a prolonged conflict. Now it was time
to settle in for Crypto Wars, Round 2.
But where and when did this new phase began? Pinpointing that exact
moment may be impossible, but the timeline below provides a relatively
comprehensive overview of the different fights that constitute the new
Crypto War, from the early months after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist
attacks to the present day.

Amici Curiae by EFF and ACLU
A Philadelphia man suspected of possessing child pornography has been in
jail for seven months and counting after being found in contempt of a court
order demanding that he decrypt two password-protected hard drives. The
suspect, a former Philadelphia Police Department sergeant, has not been
charged with any child porn crimes. Instead, he remains indefinitely
imprisoned in Philadelphia's Federal Detention Center for refusing to
unlock two drives encrypted with Apple's FileVault software in a case that
once again highlights the extent to which the authorities are going to
crack encrypted devices. The man is to remain jailed "until such time that
he fully complies" with the decryption order. The government successfully
cited a 1789 law known as the All Writs Act to compel (PDF) the suspect
to decrypt two hard drives it believes contain child pornography. The All
Writs Act was the same law the Justice Department asserted in its legal
battle with Apple.

Rule 41(b)(6)

Note *emphasis*.
Perhaps missing from the article is that, similar to FISC / DC
situation, this seems to allow LEA / Prosecutors to now cozy all
these requests up to the friendliest court they can find (if they
speculate, when concealed, that the activities *may* in fact be in
that district [1]), rather than forcing distribution of requests
randomly across them all (similar to the old principle of local
jurisdiction... crimes originate randomly, are dealt with locally).
That would be bad... bad precedents, much stuff under seal ex parte

probably end up being lodged by location of lead investigative

Anything can overwhelm anything. There's not orders of magnitude
more 'overwhelmy' tech that tanks specifically to torrenting within tor
than there is in i2p, phantom, gnunet, etc.
Don't confuse tor and its people trying to advertise itself as
a network only for certain fundamentalist use cases, with
tor tech actually being able to support any random use case
you can successfully push down its pipes. Tor sucks
by only supporting TCP, but with onioncat you can push
whatever you want over it.
Tor has stated they'd look at censoring abusive use
according to whatever their definition of abuse may be
(such as by introducing throttling code in the clients / EG's).
That's doubletalk and not a very resistant network then.
These are open networks, use them as you see fit.
If you don't, sooner or later, someone else, including the
masses, criminals and adversaries, will. And if you happen to
expose some flaw in tech or policy along the way, all the better.
In this context, no, just run a node in whatever network
makes you happy such that you give back resources
matching your own use and impact upon that network.
If you and your friends are a bunch of cheapass leeching
fucks, yes, you'll overwhelm anything.

BBC to deploy detection vans to snoop on internet users
Patrick Foster 6 August 2016  8:24am
The BBC is to spy on internet users in their homes by deploying a new
generation of Wi-Fi detection vans to identify those illicitly
watching its programmes online.
The Telegraph can disclose that from next month, the BBC vans will fan
out across the country capturing information from private Wi-Fi
networks in homes to "sniff out" those who have not paid the licence
The corporation has been given legal dispensation to use the new
technology, which is typically only available to crime-fighting
agencies, to enforce the new requirement that people watching BBC
programmes via the iPlayer must have a TV licence.
The disclosure will lead to fears about invasion of privacy and
follows years of concern over the heavy-handed approach of the BBC
towards those suspected of not paying the licence fee.  However, the
BBC insists that its inspectors will not be able to spy on other
internet browsing habits of viewers.

A corporation can be issued, issue, and hold, various licences and
certs, be they from or to, private or public entities, governments,
or persons. Could be... vendor / reseller, awards, permission to
bid / let [govt or other] contracts, provide services, etc.
Use your imagination. TPI knows what it does or doesn't hold. And
TPI can be transparent by listing them all proactively instead of
requiring community go on phishing expedition for them by name.
TPI has surely asked folks to fill out or sign, and been asked
itself, regarding NDA's / [de]briefings, pre / during / post
employment blanks, template blanket MOU's, etc.
Use your imagination. TPI operates a corporate "office", a corporate
office has form blanks for all sorts of uses. In particular when
liasing with or initiating new parties of all types.
As with the "new docs" someone posted for the future, folks are
interested in seeing any similar docs applicable to the past.
Only TPI knows what they were named. Those of employment and
[process] acknowledgement are certainly higher than stupid petty
cash and phone memo forms, come on now :)
No, the state mandated Articles and Annuals exist there.
NO!, the bylaws (another name for operating agreement), a highly
relavant thing for transparency, do not seem to exist anywhere.
Whatever other major structural and procedural docs may exist, who
knows. Those are just some of the common names for them. Other
people can add other names.
Worth nothing is that whether or not any doc is [required to be]
filed with government agencies, and whether or not it is publicly
available from them once filed... is different from what TPI may
choose to publish on its own for the community.
Regardless, whatever is publicly available or FOIA-able on a
government site should also be posted for transparency on TPI as
It's not necessarily clear, in a classically hierarchical org chart
sort of way, who held all the various high titles and when.
NO!, voting and election does not appear to be detailed at all anywhere.
Only opaque references to "duly elected" and "adopted".
And "member" often means certain things in corporate law as well.
While "non-profit" (its own curiosity to be sure), may hold certain
meaning and requirements in certain jurisdictions, the extension
of that to concepts of founding / holding parties and redistribution,
optionally to achieve "non-profit", may be different.
Links to law refs on the topic could be useful for those that didn't
already notice a reference to the possibility of that in the Articles
(under powers).
Pointless when the AOI says nothing there, and the bylaws aren't
available. Nor can community be expected to wade through MA/US law
to see if any particular "Officer" or "Director" is granted unwaivable
voting rights under law.
If TPI's release of particular docs is governed by requirement of
law, that's different. But if community can FOIA same from govt,
there is no such requirement, and TPI should transparently publish.
No user, donor, or interested party should be pushed / required to
go private fora like that. It's their right to ask in public, to
do so by proxy person or tor etc, and to retain their motivations.
And whatever TPI does with such requests is up to TPI. If it's
transparent with servicable open fora, it's a non issue.
It's also silly to be fielding multiple same requests when a single
transparent proactive publication of same will serve everyone.
Yes, minutes are very important for transparency.
It's extremely unlikely the ED's office did not know, or was not
informed, within no more than a few days of the request, probably
more like a few hours. Certainly not a few weeks.
Few could have problem with that.
As before, only with lack of ack and general plan of reply.
It should not be considered mine, but a presentment of some community
voices / ideas / tasks gone forgotten / unattended over time, into
a more prominent and useful form. And with recent events pressing...
journalists could easily be added to list of supporting and interested
Others are welcome to carry the request forward.

disabled by the user (Windows RT, HoloLens, Windows Phone, maybe Surface Hub,
and maybe some IoTCore devices if such things actually exist -- not talking
about the boards themselves which are not locked down at all by default, but end
devices sold that may have secureboot locked on).
But in some cases, the "shape" of secure boot needs to change a bit. For example
in development, engineering, refurbishment, running flightsigned stuff (as of
win10) etc. How to do that, with devices where secure boot is locked on?
Enter the Secure Boot policy.
It's a file in a binary format that's embedded within an ASN.1 blob, that is
signed. It's loaded by bootmgr REALLY early into the windows boot process. It
must be signed by a certificate in db. It gets loaded from a UEFI variable in
the secureboot namespace (therefore, it can only be touched by boot services).
There's a couple .efis signed by MS that can provision such a policy, that is,
set the UEFI variable with its contents being the policy.
What can policies do, you ask?
They have two different types of rules. BCD rules, which override settings
in the on-disk BCD, and registry rules, which contain configuration for the
policy itself, plus configuration for other parts of boot services, etc. For
example, one registry element was introduced in Windows 10 version 1607
'Redstone' which disables certificate expiry checking inside mobilestartup's
.ffu flashing (ie, the "lightning bolt" windows phone flasher); and another one
enables mobilestartup's USB mass storage mode. Other interesting registry
rules change the shape of Code Integrity, ie, for a certain type of binary,
it changes the certificates considered valid for that specific binary.
(Alex Ionescu wrote a
blog post that touches on Secure Boot policies. He teased a
followup post that would be all about them, but that never came.)
But, they must be signed by a cert in db. That is to say, Microsoft.
Also, there is such a thing called DeviceID. It's the first 64 bits of a salted
SHA-256 hash, of some UEFI PRNG output. It's used when applying policies on
Windows Phone, and on Windows RT (mobilestartup sets it on Phone, and
SecureBootDebug.efi when that's launched for the first time on RT). On Phone,
the policy must be located in a specific place on EFIESP partition with the
filename including the hex-form of the DeviceID. (With Redstone, this got
changed to UnlockID, which is set by bootmgr, and is just the raw UEFI PRNG
Basically, bootmgr checks the policy when it loads, if it includes a DeviceID,
which doesn't match the DeviceID of the device that bootmgr is running on, the
policy will fail to load.
Any policy that allows for enabling testsigning (MS calls these Retail Device
Unlock / RDU policies, and to install them is unlocking a device), is supposed
to be locked to a DeviceID (UnlockID on Redstone and above). Indeed, I have
several policies (signed by the Windows Phone production certificate) like
this, where the only differences are the included DeviceID, and the signature.
If there is no valid policy installed, bootmgr falls back to using a default
policy located in its resources. This policy is the one which blocks enabling
testsigning, etc, using BCD rules.
Now, for Microsoft's screwups.
During the development of Windows 10 v1607 'Redstone', MS added a new type of
secure boot policy. Namely, "supplemental" policies that are located in the
EFIESP partition (rather than in a UEFI variable), and have their settings
merged in, dependant on conditions (namely, that a certain "activation" policy
is also in existance, and has been loaded in).
Redstone's bootmgr.efi loads "legacy" policies (namely, a policy from UEFI
variables) first. At a certain time in redstone dev, it did not do any further
checks beyond signature / deviceID checks. (This has now changed, but see how
the change is stupid)
After loading the "legacy" policy, or a base policy from EFIESP partition, it
then loads, checks and merges in the supplemental policies.
See the issue here? If not, let me spell it out to you plain and clear.
The "supplemental" policy contains new elements, for the merging conditions.
These conditions are (well, at one time) unchecked by bootmgr when loading a
legacy policy. And bootmgr of win10 v1511 and earlier certainly doesn't know
about them. To those bootmgrs, it has just loaded in a perfectly valid, signed
The "supplemental" policy does NOT contain a DeviceID. And, because they were
meant to be merged into a base policy, they don't contain any BCD rules either,
which means that if they are loaded, you can enable testsigning. Not just for
windows (to load unsigned driver, ie rootkit), but for the {bootmgr} element
as well, which allows bootmgr to run what is effectively an unsigned .efi
(ie bootkit)!!! (In practise, the .efi file must be signed, but it can be
self-signed) You can see how this is very bad!! A backdoor, which MS put
in to secure boot because they decided to not let the user turn it off in
certain devices, allows for secure boot to be disabled everywhere!
You can see the irony. Also the irony in that MS themselves provided us several
nice "golden keys" (as the FBI would say ;) for us to use for that purpose :)
About the FBI: are you reading this? If you are, then this is a perfect real
world example about why your idea of backdooring cryptosystems with a "secure
golden key" is very bad! Smarter people than me have been telling this to you
for so long, it seems you have your fingers in your ears. You seriously don't
understand still? Microsoft implemented a "secure golden key" system. And the
golden keys got released from MS own stupidity. Now, what happens if you tell
everyone to make a "secure golden key" system? Hopefully you can add 2+2...
Anyway, enough about that little rant, wanted to add that to a writeup ever
since this stuff was found ;)
Anyway, MS's first patch attempt. I say "attempt" because it surely doesn't do
anything useful. It blacklists (in boot.stl), most (not all!) of the policies.
Now, about boot.stl. It's a file that gets cloned to a UEFI variable only boot
services can touch, and only when the boot.stl signing time is later than the
time this UEFI variable was set.
However, this is done AFTER a secure boot policy gets loaded. Redstone's
bootmgr has extra code to use the boot.stl in the UEFI variable to check
policy revocation, but the bootmgrs of TH2 and earlier does NOT have such
So, an attacker can just replace a later bootmgr with an earlier one.
Another thing: I saw some additional code in the load-legacy-policy function in
redstone 14381.rs1_release. Code that wasn't there in 14361. Code that
specifically checked the policy being loaded for an element that meant this was
a supplemental policy, and erroring out if so. So, if a system is running
Windows 10 version 1607 or above, an attacker MUST replace bootmgr with
an earlier one.
On August 9th, 2016, another patch came about, this one was given the
MS16-100 and CVE-2016-3320. This one updates dbx. The
advisory says it revokes
bootmgrs. The dbx update seems to add these SHA256 hashes (unless I screwed up
my parsing):
I checked the hash in the signature of several bootmgrs of several
architectures against this list, and found no matches. So either this
revokes many "obscure" bootmgrs and bootmgfws, or I'm checking the wrong hash.
Either way, it'd be impossible in practise for MS to revoke every bootmgr
earlier than a certain point, as they'd break install media, recovery
backups, etc.

References: <20160816052039.GF27807
Many times, over many decades, by many people... and been done.
Those users and shops have their entire /usr/local or /opt
(bin sbin lib include share doc etc and so on) as nothing but script
managed symlink trees as means of tagging the active default version.
And keep the multiple program-M.m.r versions on disk therein, which
are manually callable as needed for new testing and legacy use.
With scripts to build, install, and symlink it all. Dependencies,
namespace collisions, runtime issues with ld rpath and friends, and
the whims of program authors... all tend to buzzkill many efforts
Github might have something for you.
There are also variant symlinks:
The "FHS" of a base OS, be it Linux or BSD, typically exclusively
reserve /usr/local for their default package manager, and reserve
compiled and installed by competant system admin.
Single letter trees for package installs serve no purpose and are
anti human. There's no performance need to turn the fs into a binary
tree (todays kernels and fs can handle flat dirs many times the
needs of any installed package set). Nor need to turn the fs into
a database, that's what package managers are for.
Nobody wants such a symlink mess in the base system, ever.
And things like pivot root, snapshots, portable processes, rolling
release, vm, jail, layered fs, and patchable kernel are all happening.
Leaving just handling /usr/local...
Most people usually don't have need for multiple versions, just a
current version that works. Even packaging just that is hard and a
lot of work by a lot of people. Thus port / package tools naturally
remain rather simple.
Sure there are issues with limited accomodations for versioning /
site in package managers. So see /opt above. Or roll your own distro,
and packager and reach wide adoption with it.
Until then, excepting some tool and port sharing among Linux
and BSD's, things are exactly this, and wishful thunking.
If troubled on Linux, at least look at the BSD's... their hier's
are cleaner and enforced, partly from not going the "distro" model
of random thunkers.

Just As Intended: The U.S. Election Is Tearing Us To Shreds

The only credible narrative about the US election is that both the
main candidates are shit and the system is fundamentally broken.
The third-party candidate, while enjoying organic growth in public
support, is largely blacklisted by media and in the last election
cycle was handcuffed to a chair for a prolonged period of time in
order to prevent her from participating in the Presidential debates at
In the backwards Orwellian nightmare we live in, exercising common
sense or stating things as they quite plainly are and thus expressing
views that oppose the monied and complicit status quo, is deemed a
‘radical’ and untenable position.
Radical because too few have the proverbial balls to openly speak
their mind or own the full extent of their true opinions in public,
making those of us who do a rarity.
Untenable because doing so makes you a target for relentless
persecution or worse; a deterrent which is highly effective against
those who treasure their public perception or persona, possessions,
property, prosperity or (perceived) privacy above the need to appease
their conscience by calling a spade a spade, honouring their humanity
and openly advocating for the sociopolitical evolution we so
desperately need.
It was only a few years ago that millions of people were emboldened to
speak up and demand radical (read: common sense) change. The relative
speed with which they were largely subdued and corralled back into the
political mainstream is frankly shocking and testament to the lethal
efficiency of the systems of social control that surround us.

The cost of wiring to your neighbor is similar to wireless, yet wired
will always perform better, is vastly more private and tap evident.
Use wireless for shots where you cant secure legit or guerrilla
wired rights. Performance matters when the airwaves are
full of noise and you're running layers of required overlay routing /
crypto net / fill traffic over it, not to mention your data.
If the network filestore overlay splits and spreads random blocks
across nodes, sneakernet will just add random avg replication,
afaik no networks or storage have that capability to plugin?
Of course if you trust the anonymity of your overlays,
anyone can host unsplit copies of anything they want.
Then, other than again needing a network with a plugin
capable datastore, if it's not encrypted unknown to you,
you'd have to trust getting it in person, which probably rightly
isn't going to happen unless you're already BOFs with MAD.

There is only one purpose for an entity
to crack any currency and that's to kill it.
Because any cracked wallets would instantly make
worldwide headlines and the currency would
go to zero within a day.
Depending on the speed of the adversary, you
might be able to migrate crypto fast
enough to save some wallets but the losers

chain until the pressure is unbearable.
The entity isn't going to be able to recoup
its costs in a zero market.
Even cracking supposedly dead wallets is risk
of zero without proof of deadness, granny
might still have her mitts on them and be
watching every day.
Since an entity full of people is unlikely to
be able to keep a secret kill secret, they'd
be better off accelerating mining, selling

Perhaps that's what's happening now... ;)
If an entity has a crack it probably can't use it,
and the same scenario applies if a rogue within
it appropriates it for their own purposes.
And for any independant loner who discovers it.
They only have odds at a few wallets before
they hit the wrong one and news breaks.
And for them it will be all about the lulz.
Either way, digital currencies will come

Unless Bitcoin solves its serious scalability
and anonymity issues, people will probably
be slowly trading out of it into something
else within the next 5-10 years anyway.

**Samsung Warns Customers To Think Twice
About What They Say Near Smart TVs*
By *Jake Anderson **- February 12, 2016*
*(**ANTIMEDIA* *)* /—/ In a troubling new
development in the domestic consumer surveillance debate, an
investigation into Samsung Smart TVs has revealed that user voice
commands are recorded, stored, and transmitted to a third party. The
company even warns customers not to discuss
personal or sensitive information within earshot of the device.
This is in stark contrast to previous claims by tech manufacturers,
like Playstation
who vehemently deny their devices record personal information, despite
evidence to the contrary, including news that hackers can gain access
to unencrypted streams of credit card information.
The new Samsung controversy stems from the discovery of a single
haunting statement in the company’s “privacy policy,” which states:
sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured
and transmitted to a third party.”/
This sparked a back and forth between the /Daily Beast/
and Samsung regarding not only consumer privacy but also security
concerns. If our conversations are “captured and transmitted,”
eavesdropping hackers may be able to use our “personal or other
sensitive information” for identity theft or any number of nefarious
There is also the concern that such information could be turned over to
law enforcement or government agencies. With the revelation of the PRISM
program /—/ by which the NSA collected data from Microsoft, Google, and
Facebook /— /and other such NSA spying programs
, neither the government nor
the private sector has the benefit of the doubt in claiming tech
companies are not conscripted into divulging sensitive consumer info
under the auspices of national security.
Michael Price
counsel in the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan
Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law, stated:
content and convenience, but it is also incredibly personal,
constitutionally protected information that should not be for sale to
advertisers and should require a warrant for law enforcement to access.”/
Responding to the controversy, Samsung updated its privacy policy, named
its third party partner, and issued the following statement:
commands, is a Samsung Smart TV feature, which can be activated or
deactivated by the user. The TV owner can also disconnect the TV from
the Wi-Fi network.”/
Under still more pressure, Samsung named
its third party affiliate, Nuance Communications. In a statement to
data. Nuance respects the privacy of its users in its use of speech
data. Our use of such data is for the development and improvement of our
voice recognition and natural language understanding technologies. As
outlined in our privacy policy, third parties work under contract with
Nuance, pursuant to confidentiality agreements, to help Nuance tailor
and deliver the speech recognition and natural language service, and to
help Nuance develop, tune, enhance, and improve its products and services./
does not have a relationship with government agencies to turn over
consumer data…..There is no intention to trace these samples to specific
people or users.”/
Nuance’s Wikipedia page
 mentions that the
company maintains a small division for government and military system
development, but that is not confirmed at this time.
Despite protestations from these companies that our voice command data
is not being traced to specific users or, worse, stored for use by
government or law enforcement agencies, it seems that when it comes to
constitutional civil liberties, the end zone keeps getting pushed
further and further down the field.
For years, technologists and smart device enthusiasts claimed webcam and
voice recording devices did not store our information. While Samsung may
be telling the truth about the use of that data, there are countless
companies integrating smart technology who may not be using proper
encryption methods and may have varying contractual obligations to
government or law enforcement.
Is it really safe for us to assume that the now exceedingly evident
symbiotic relationship between multinational corporations and government
agencies does not still include a revolving door for the sharing of
sensitive consumer data?

In order of increasing power consumption, Spot takes three kinds of
location fixes: a Venue Fix, a Tracking Fix, and a Fingerprint Fix.
Venue fixes have an entry time and a duration. For example, say you
were visiting a client’s office for an hour long meeting. Spot would
take a fix about 5-15 minutes into the meeting and a second fix
roughly 5-15 minutes after you’ve left the office to declare a venue
fix of your location, time and duration, perhaps for 67 minutes and 13
seconds. A Venue fix exploits Apple’s location database of both cell
towers and Wi-Fi access points. While these are not as precise as GPS
measurements, in practice, they are quite good. We believe that these
fixes alone are sufficient to handle most tax residency issues.
Consuming a bit more power are the optional Tracking fixes. These
fixes are calculated when the phone switches cell phone towers. While
they typically have an accuracy radius of about a kilometer, they are
also, in practice, quite accurate in showing the progress of your day.
Finally, a Fingerprint fix, which is taken by running the app and
pressing the fingerprint icon in the upper left corner, uses the GPS
to record your position with the highest resolution possible. When you
need to prove that you have crossed that state line before midnight,
the Fingerprint fix is what you want to use. Since its accuracy radius
can be as large as 65 meters, more than half a football field long,
make sure you are significantly past the state line when you take the

Yes. ie: All of the current strong anonymity overlay networks successfully
fend off and are immune to the copyright MAFIAA, and all manner of other
civil, police and non-state adversaries. (Note that's real world in practice

Yes. Physical location separation plus non pattern generation.
Yes. Though it still supplies profiling database and parallel
construction in that mode.
Tor is fundamentally a tunneled circuit based encrypted network.
It was designed roughly 15 years before Snowden's confirmations
and before 911 in a time when networks were still mostly trusted
and GPA's effectively spying at scale much less attacking were only
in the minds of crackpot cypherpunks.
Tor's circuit design probably doesn't lend itself to fill traffic / management,
and bolting it on the side may be non ideal. (Those are open questions.)
Yet "Tor" without its original design model could hardly longer be called
Tor (or TOR) at that point.
If you want fill traffic, you're probably better off forking and gutting
it, or starting something completely new that incorporates ideas
from knowledge both inclusive and post Tor's design.
Tor is great at what it does well, which is a lot.
You just have to know what that is, and find (or make
in it or elsewhere) what it isn't good at.
You'll be dead by then. It's more fun to risk dying now ;)
Tor is looking at some forms of network fill traffic, which may
or may not be integrated to the entire network wide sense, or
useful in your own designs...

Maybe you have some validation packets looping around and

know traffic from you is from you as an endpoint. Maybe you're
doing nothing and he wastes time.
If all nodes are multiply connected and independantly reclocking
and jittering their output packet streams and your data passes
through at least one good node besides yourself, it erases all
the bad signals perturbed up to reaching it.
Encryption also thwarts picking out some given user.
Yet, again, what is trying to be defeated?
- strict GPA  (I only ever said this type)
- traffic manipulation at internet layer
- evil nodes doing whatever
Fill is more obvious applicable to strict GPA.
It gets harder for latter two, for which fill traffic
may not be as simple benefit, and maybe start playing
with packet switching / mixing / spreading / reassembly.
What is adversaries non sunk cost and reach and

@_subject: Fwd: [Cryptography] A possible alternative to TOR and PrivaTegrity 
References: ---------- Forwarded message ----------
This is an old idea, but perhaps now there might be more reason to
consider it.  I currently call this idea Alias.  Here's my dumb
data-dump on it.  Thoughts?
Alias is a concept for a TOR-like Internet protocol supporting free
speech and user privacy, but without encouraging the worst evil
behaviors.  Exit Nodes are replaced with Public Gateways, which
sponsor users.  The definition of evil behavior is defined by the
Public Gateways and operators of routing nodes.  Users would be
encouraged to use good behavior, as their public alias would develop a
reputation over time.  Anonymity would be protected, but a user's
Public Gateway and any routing node could refuse to route data for
aliases with poor reputations.
TOR was created with a lofty goal: to support free speech.
Unfortunately, TOR has drawn attention from governments and law
enforcement, as it could be used to protect some of the worst
activities, such as contract killing, and the slave trade.  TOR Exit
Node operators generally follow a strict policy of never looking at
traffic, because simply observing this traffic would require Exit Node
operators in most countries to regularly contact law enforcement to
report crimes.  PrivaTegrity is an alternative protocol to TOR, which
aims to find a balance between protecting free speech and protecting
the world from the worst behavior.  Unfortunately, the PrivaTegrity
inserts encryption backdoors.
Alias Design:
This is very much a dumb idea in the half-baked stage.  Feedback and
ideas are welcome.
Alias would be a fork of TOR, and route Internet traffic from a user's
machine through a couple of Routing Nodes, to a Public Gateway, which
replaces the Exit Node.  The Public Gateway would have an account for
the user, under a pseudonym used on Alias network by the user, called
his alias.  The Public Gateway should keep an email contact address
for the user, similar to regular accounts on various web sites.
In Alias, user aliases would have trackable reputations, and the
reputations of user aliases would be combined into a reputation for a
Public Gateway.  At a minimum, incident reports would be used to
compute user reputations.  Exactly how this works is TBD, but the goal
is to cause gateways with very poor reputations to be effectively
blacklisted by routing nodes, and for users with poor reputations to
be dropped by reputable gateways.  Users could move their alias from
one gateway to another when needed, but they could not erase what
their previous gateway knows about there identity.  The Gateway would
not know a user's location, and in many cases will know nothing other
than the user's reputation and email address.  When requested by a
government authority, at a minimum, a gateway can drop support for a
user alias, causing that alias to try to find a new gateway that will
agree to sponsor it.
Participants who act as routing nodes in Alias would be able to select
what sort of reputations they require from aliases and Gateways to
allow traffic to be routed through them to those gateways.  They
could, for example, choose to not route data for any gateway with a
high reputation for routing to pornography sites.
I compare the TOR, PrivaTegrity, and Alias concepts in several "threat
cases" below:
Threat Case: Governments Overreact to Terrorism
In this case, we assume all the governments involved have decided to
share all user network traffic in a mass surveillance program.  The
user Alice has something to say, such as wanting to tell the world
that the mass surveillance program exists.
TOR:  Alice succeeds in using TOR to log into various blogging sites
and publishes her knowledge about the surveillance program.
Unfortunately, TOR provides limited defense against the Men in Black
(MiB), and Alice may be arrested.  The MiB is assumed to compromise
TOR in various ways, such as operating many Exit Nodes and monitoring
meta-data such as packet timing and size between nodes.
PrivaTegrity:  With the assumption that all governments involved are
colluding, Alice is revealed directly, without having to subvert the
Alias:  Alice needs a Public Gateway to sponsor her.  She can choose a
gateway with a reputation of sponsoring free speech, such various
newspapers, in a country that is not participating in the mass
surveillance program.  When Alice posts what she knows to various
blogs, the Public Gateway (newspaper in this case) will be the the one
defending her anonymity.  In any case, even if the newspaper is forced
to reveal what they know about Alice, they never knew her location.
Conclusion: Alias seems to provide better protection of free speech in
this case.
Threat Case: A Single Government Blackmails the Rest
Suppose one of the governments involved decides to use it’s influence
in the protocol to blackmail one or more of the other governments
involved into agreeing to some political agenda.
TOR: If the government were the USA, it might have unique powers to
track users through the TOR network.  If true, the USA could refuse to
reveal a French suspected terrorist unless the French government share
mass surveillance data collected on it’s citizens.  Is this sort of
thinking too paranoid?
PrivaTegrity:  With nine separate governments who must collude to
expose a user, it is possible for any one of the nine to blackmail the
rest.  For example, if tracking down a particular user is of critical
importance to one government, another could demand certain trade
policies be agreed to before allowing that user to be revealed.
Alias:  A country containing the Public Gateway sponsoring a user
might make political demands from another country before agreeing to
force the Public Gateway to reveal a user’s email address.  However,
this coercion is weaker than weaker than the TOR case because there is
no country with majority control, and weaker than the PrivaTegrity
case because a government can coerce cooperation only from Public
Gateways in its country.
Conclusion: While none are immune to this threat, Alias seems to
perform better in this case.
Threat Case: Hackers Compromise the Network
In this case, a group of hackers wants to reveal the identity of a
particular user.
TOR: There is little chance that the attacker can hack all the nodes
from the user to the Exit Node, and since the Exit Node has no
information about the user, there seems to be little chance that the
hacker can reveal the user’s identity, short of bugs in the protocol.
PrivaTegrity:  While hackers might hack one or more of the nine
governments, it would be a considerable task for the hacker to hack
them all.  However, it is possible, and this is a weakness vs TOR.
Alias:  The hacker need only hack the user’s chosen Public Gateway,
which is a considerably simpler task than with PrivaTegrity.
Conclusion:  Hackability of Public Gateways is a significant weakness
for Alias compared to the other two.
Threat Case:  Evil Users Secretly Collude
In this case, suppose there is strong evidence that several evil users
wants to collude to do something terrible, and they want to
communicate anonymously.  For example, they could be running a
contract-killing business or enslaving people and selling them on the
Dark Web.
TOR:  Unfortunately, evil behaviors have been enabled in some cases over TOR.
PrivaTegrity:  The users involved in such evil activities can have
their communication secretly wiretapped.  This is a strong capability
for law enforcement in this case.
Alias: Assuming reputable Public Gateways are used, most of the users’
emails would be revealed to law enforcement.  This is weaker than a
Conclusion: In the case of severe evil, PrivaTegrity performs the
best, Alias next best, and TOR the worst.
Threat Case:  Somewhat Evil Users Secretly Collude
What is evil vs good is highly subjective, and getting people to agree
can be difficult.  In this case, the users are engaged in what most
reasonable people consider evil.  For example, consider illegal trade
in ivory, which could lead to the extinction of wild elephants.
TOR:  Users trading in ivory likely would benefit from using TOR.
PrivaTegrity:  Having to get cooperation from nine governments may be
too painful when tracking down a single ivory trader, and the ivory
trader likely could use PrivaTegrity to their advantage.  If, on the
other hand, the nine governments put in place a rapid rubber-stamp
process to enable going after small-time criminals, then this
capability can be highly abused.
Alias:  Ivory traders would avoid using Alias through reputable Public
Gateways, since their identities could easily be revealed¸ and the
sites the traders visit to buy/sell ivory would not likely be very
reputable, lowering their alias' reputation.
Conclusion: Alias seems to perform better at determine somewhat evil behaviors.

The USA and Soviets have decades experience tapping cables
around the globe in a cold war sense.
The USA/FVEY has top secret blackops and administrative via corp
partnership and various legal and extralegal access to extensive cable,
hardware, and organizational assets around the globe.
It is simply foolish to not assume that the world is highly
compromised by these actors.
Snowden and all the other surveillance and bigdata news and political
rhetoric have been telling you that for over a decade now.
You might be safe if you are in a locale untouchable by these actors,
conduct all your activities in that locale, and have no similar local
Did you just push a bunch of packets over time into your ISP and
have google send replies back? Well, they can see both ends, so
they saw that traffic pattern in and out, and back in and out, so
they know who's talking to who and when.
In addition to simple taps, they can also deploy passive or
active nodes in any of these networks at will. And use all
the tools to perturb things in favor of their efforts.
Tor and other networks are good at hiding endpoints (users, servers)
from each other, keeping traffic content encrypted over the wire, letting
you anonymously publish and consume stuff among other users that
isn't really of interest to (against) such adversaries (and thus won't get
you killed or jailed or disappeared (but will still get you databased
for life)),
and getting around some censorship. That's probably about it.
However when it comes to such global (and regionally lucky) passive
adversaries, and adversaries operating the networks themselves, I
seriously doubt anyone can say with a straight face that these
networks protect against network analysis... who is talking to
who and when.
It would be harder for that analysis to succeed against networks
that filled between all the nodes with fill traffic when unused and
not needed for user traffic. (And in the sense of Tor, between clients
and some number of guards). But that's hard to design so that it
is functional. And no one in the overlay network / messaging field
really seems to be trying it. Mindset, OMG bandwidth, probably
buzzkills most research before it gets started.
Here's some recent mostly tor specific threads if anyone's interested,
plus whatever else has come up whenever I've mentioned this.

general feel in their countries and locales and areas of expertise

"No Cost" License Plate Readers Are Turning Texas Police into Mobile
Debt Collectors and Data Miners
Vigilant Solutions, one of the country’s largest brokers of vehicle
surveillance technology, is offering a hell of a deal to law
enforcement agencies in Texas: a whole suite of automated license
plate reader (ALPR) equipment and access to the company’s massive
databases and analytical tools—and it won’t cost the agency a dime.
Even though the technology is marketed as budget neutral, that doesn’t
mean no one has to pay. Instead, Texas police fund it by gouging
people who have outstanding court fines and handing Vigilant all of
the data they gather on drivers for nearly unlimited commercial use.
ALPR refers to high-speed camera networks that capture license plate
images, convert the plate numbers into machine-readable text, geotag
and time-stamp the information, and store it all in database systems.
EFF has long been concerned with this technology, because ALPRs
typically capture sensitive location information on all drivers—not
just criminal suspects—and, in aggregate, the information can reveal
personal information, such as where you go to church, what doctors you
visit, and where you sleep at night.
Vigilant is leveraging H.B. 121, a new Texas law passed in 2015 that
allows officers to install credit and debit card readers in their
patrol vehicles to take payment on the spot for unpaid court fines,
also known as capias warrants. When the law passed, Texas legislators
argued that not only would it help local government with their
budgets, it would also benefit the public and police. As the bill’s

Security firm Bitdefender has issued an alert about a malicious app
that hands over control of Macs to criminals via Tor. The software,
called EasyDoc Converter.app, is supposed to be a file converter but
doesn't do its advertised functions. Instead it drops complex malware
onto the system that subverts the security of the system, allowing it
to be used as part of a botnet or to spy on the owner. "This type of
malware is particularly dangerous as it's hard to detect and offers
the attacker full control of the compromised system," said Tiberius
Axinte, Technical Leader, Bitdefender Antimalware Lab. "For instance,
someone can lock you out of your laptop, threaten to blackmail you to
restore your private files or transform your laptop into a botnet to
attack other devices. The possibilities are endless." The malware,
dubbed Backdoor.MAC.Eleanor, sets up a hidden Tor service and
PHP-capable web server on the infected computer, generating a .onion
domain that the attacker can use to connect to the Mac and control it.
Once installed, the malware grants full access to the file system and
can run scripts given to it by its masters.A report on AppleInsider
says that malware can also control the FaceTime camera on a victim's
computer. But thankfully, Apple's Gatekeeper security prevents the
unsigned app from being installed.

Putin gives federal security agents two weeks to produce 'encryption
keys' for the Internet
13:28, 7 july 2016
After signing controversial anti-terrorist legislation earlier today,
President Putin ordered the Federal Security Service (the FSB, the
post-Soviet successor to the KGB) to produce encryption keys to
decrypt all data on the Internet.  According to the executive order,
the FSB has two weeks to do it.  Responsibility for carrying out
Putin's instructions falls on Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the
The new "anti-terrorist" laws require all "organizers of information
distribution" that add "additional coding" to transmitted electronic
messages to provide the FSB with any information necessary to decrypt
those messages.  It's still unclear what information exactly online
resources are expected to turn over, given that all data on the
Internet is encoded, one way or another, and in many instances
encryption keys for encrypted information simply don't exist.
The Duma's new 'Big-Brother' legislation kills Russia's Internet
companies and hurts ordinary Web users.  Here's how.
16:06, 27 june 2016
Last week, lawmakers in the State Duma approved what Edward Snowden
has called "Russia's new Big-Brother law."  A major part of this
legislation creates new regulations on the Internet.  According to the
amendments, telecom providers and the "organizers of information
distribution" will need to store copies of nearly all information they
transmit.  They can't delete this information until it's six months
old.  This applies to recordings of phone calls, as well as the
contents of text messages.  And they have to keep copies of metadata
of these communications (the information about when and between whom
messages occurred, but not the actual content of the messages) for a
whopping three years.  Companies will additionally be required to help
Russia's Federal Security Service (the modern-day successor to the
Soviet KGB) decrypt all the data.  The largest Internet companies in
Russia--Mail.ru and Yandex--oppose the bill, as do the industry groups
the Russian Association for Electronic
 Communications and the Regional Center for Internet Technologies, and
even the "Communications and IT" working group within the Russian
government.  Meduza looks at why this legislation isn't just
impractical, but will also harm ordinary Internet users and Internet
companies alike.
It's expensive
The legislation requires telecom providers and "organizers of
information distribution" (which could be literally any website on the
Internet, as determined by Russia's state censor) to store all data
sent by its users or visitors.  This is a gigantic amount of data:
Russia would need every data-storage manufacturer in the world working
for seven years straight, before the country had the infrastructure
necessary to accommodate so much storage and processing.
And there's another problem: the electrical grid in central Russia
simply isn't powerful enough to fuel the still-unbuilt data centers
that will be required by the new legislation.  The equipment and
materials needed to build these data centers, moreover, isn't produced
in Russia, so companies will be forced to buy imported goods.
Experts say the costs of building this infrastructure will be more
than 5 trillion rubles (roughly $77 billion).  For comparison, the
federal government's total revenues in 2015 totaled 13.7 trillion
rubles (about $210 billion).  The legislation says implementing the
new statutes won't require any state subsidies, but that's untrue: at
the very least, government agencies will need to upgrade the country's
data cables (given that Russia's existing network of cables is too
weak to cope with the higher volume of transmitted information created
by the new regulations).
The government also risks losing income from Russia's Internet
companies, which currently pay taxes on their profits.  The new
legislation could make many businesses unprofitable, after they're
forced to spend tens if not millions of rubles on new data-storage
It's dumb
The new legislation requires all "organizers of information
distribution" that add "additional coding" to transmitted electronic
messages to provide the Federal Security Service (FSB) with any
information necessary to decrypt those messages.  What lawmakers seem
not to understand is that virtually all information transmitted over
the Internet is "encoded."  Any text or image sent over email using
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is in something called
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) format.  Will
"organizers" need to send the FSB information about how MIME works?
If we're talking about encryption, we're talking about almost half the
traffic on the Internet--and the volume is only growing.  In most
cases, incidentally, the "organizers of information distribution"
don't have the keys to decrypt their own data.  (That is precisely how
Internet privacy works.)  For example, it's not even technically
possible to store encryption keys when using the HTTPS protocol, which
is used by an enormous number of websites, including the one you're
reading now, and even Gosuslugi.ru, the Russian government's official
portal where citizens can contact the state about public services.  In
other words, the legislation bans the state's own website for contact
with ordinary citizens.
How this legislation is supposed to regulate financial systems is also
unclear.  The SWIFT network that links the world's financial
institutions doesn't use Russian cryptographic algorithms, but nearly
all the world's banks--including banks in Russia--use SWIFT.  The
world's payment systems, moreover, are required to comply with the
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), a proprietary
information security standard that doesn't disclose its encryption
In order to comply with the legislation, programmers will need to come
up with new encryption methods that must simultaneously work with
existing encryption methods, given that foreign companies won't
support these new technologies (which don't currently exist, anyway).
But even if Russia manages to create some kind of center to house all
encryption keys, the concentration of data would make the center
extremely attractive, and therefore very vulnerable, to hackers.  By
breaking into this hypothetical data center, after all, it would be
possible to decrypt any message sent inside Russia.
The new legislation also violates Russian citizens' right to the
privacy of correspondence, which is enshrined in Article 23 of the
Constitution.  In order to deprive Russians of this right, police need
a court order.  The "Yarovaya legislation," however, grants
law-enforcement agencies access to everyone's messages without any
judicial oversight.
Today, most messaging apps use encryption.  In fact, encryption is one
of their most important competitive advantages, as users often seek
out the safest and most secure communications available.  The new law
will make any Russian online service less competitive.  It's unclear
what foreign companies will do.  Some might simply walk away from the
Russian market.

Barrett Brown
Partly as a consequence of my natural rambunctiousness, I’ve spent a
total of five months over the past few years of incarceration being
held in 23- to 24-hour-a-day Special Housing Unit confinement cells,
collectively and informally known as “the hole,” at three different
prisons and in stints ranging from six to 60 days; indeed, my first
three Intercept columns were composed from the SHU over at Federal
Correctional Institution Fort Worth. But as these were given over
largely to rambling self-promotion and some rather intemperate attacks
on several contemporary novelists, I’ve never gotten around to
providing a real sense of what it’s actually like to live in one of
these federal dungeons.
The chief thing to keep in mind is that dungeons vary. The most
fundamental division lies between those in which inmates are kept
singly in cells along a corridor set off from the rest of the prison
and purposefully denied human contact to one extent or another, and
those in which two prisoners are kept together in such cells, usually
with a window or metalwork grill on the door through which inmates can
communicate with others in their corridor via the age-old medium of
shouting. The first — known as solitary confinement to everyone but
prison officials, who’ve gradually replaced the term with an
assortment of euphemisms — is often conflated in the public mind with
the second, lesser-known setup, but at any rate the nature of one’s
detention is such that human contact is either intentionally and
elaborately absent or haphazardly and excruciatingly omnipresent.
Even within these two categories, one finds a great deal of variation
from institution to institution, but day-to-day SHU life at FCI Fort
Worth should make for a useful baseline. There, a weekday begins at 6
a.m. when the lights in one’s cell come on. A few minutes later the
rectangular slot in one’s door is unlocked and a guard pushes in a
plastic tray containing breakfast along with a couple of little
plastic bags of milk. It’s rather dehumanizing, this matter of having
to drink milk out of bags like a common Canadian, but getting
breakfast in bed every day makes up for it. Fifteen minutes later the
guard comes back and takes up the trays, and then one of his
colleagues will walk down the hall jotting down the names of those who
want to go outside for one’s permitted daily hour of weekday
recreation. Having compiled the list, the guard goes back to his
station and tries to arrange things such that incompatible inmates
aren’t placed together in the same recreation cage. This sort of
reminds me of the old riddle about the farmer who has a fox and a
rooster and a bag of corn but can only take one at a time across the
river in his boat and the fox will eat the rooster and the rooster
will eat the corn if either pair is left together unattended (the
solution, incidentally, is to shoot the fox, because it’s a fox).
If you are indeed going to rec that morning, the guard opens the hatch
and you back up to it and put your hands through to be handcuffed, and
then your cellmate does likewise regardless of whether or not he’s
going out as well, as the door isn’t ever supposed to be opened until
both occupants are cuffed. When the door does open, you walk out
backward before being patted down and scanned with a hand-held metal
detector, led out to the courtyard, placed in one of several large
cages with your scientifically designated playmate, and then uncuffed
through the slot in the gate. After an hour of kicking around a
deflated basketball while yelling old Symbionese Liberation Army
slogans at the other prisoners, you’re cuffed back up through the gate
slot and returned to your cell. A bit later we get lunch, and then
dinner a few hours afterward, followed by mail. Three days a week
we’re cuffed up and taken to the other end of the hall for showers. On
weekends we generally don’t leave our cells at all.
It’s a schedule that leaves prisoners with a great deal of free time,
much of which tends to be spent in sleep or exercise. The chief
workout routine in the SHU, as well as in jail units and other locales
where even improvised equipment can be hard to drum up, is something
called burpies, which entails an alternating series of push-ups,
squats, and leg thrusts and which I refer to as Berbers because
“burpies” is vulgar. Not that I do them anyway, or any other exercise,
and I’ve never approved of excessive sleeping, either, for life is not
meant to be spent in rest, but rather in conflict or preparation for
future conflict.
There is one common SHU activity in which I do happily participate,
though, simply because it’s something that can’t be done elsewhere and
naturally I’m trying to experience all the touristy prison things
before my release just in case I don’t come back for a while. The SHU
is the only place of which I’m aware where it’s socially acceptable to
yell random nonsense where other people can hear it. Now, much of the
yelling that people do through gaps under the door or the crack
between the door and its mounting or the metal grills that serve as
windows in some units, as the case may be, is entirely purposeful
communication consisting of gossip, plots, threats, lyrics, Symbionese
Liberation Army slogans, vows, requests, and commercial offers, and
this sort of thing will go on throughout the day, with peak times
occurring after meals and other periods when everyone tends to be
awake (as to how those commercial offers are accepted, there is a
process known as “fishing” or “shooting the line” by which small items
may be transferred among inmates, but a full column’s description will
be required to do it justice; suffice it to say that string and
persistence are involved).
But in addition to all of this more or less mundane intercourse,
there’s also a wholly distinct and inimitable element of
shouting-for-the-sake-of-shouting. Some of this takes the form of
memes; at Seagoville Federal Detention Center, for instance, the
guards once brought in a drunk off the compound who, after being
placed in his cell, spent the next hour banging on the door and
yelling out some sloshy, inconsequential narrative that he would
punctuate every few sentences with the refrain, “They hear me but they
don’t FEEL me, though!” Thereafter this phrase became a very popular
meme that would be shouted out several times a day; it had been
incorporated into the vibrant oral culture of our particular SHU
But SHU shouts can be, and often are, more or less apropos of nothing.
I myself was fond of drinking six or seven lukewarm cups of the
freeze-dried instant coffee we can buy from the weekly commissary
cart, going up to the door grill, and calling out in a raspy, feminine
voice, “My brother is coming … with MANY FREMEN WARRIORS” about 20 or
30 times in a row, often capped off with a triumphant, “Meet the
Atreides Gom Jabbar, grandfather!” And it wouldn’t occur to anyone to
inquire as to why I’d done this; people in the SHU wake up every
morning with a sort of preternatural awareness that someone could
start yelling out lines from David Lynch’s highly underrated 1984 film
version of Dune at any moment and will either assume that the yeller
needed to do this to feel self-actualized or, alternatively, that he’s
one of the untold thousands of mentally ill prisoners whom U.S. prison
authorities have allowed to languish in punishment cells for years on
end (though in my case, people tended to recognize me by voice as the
guy who was always kicking around the deflated basketball and calling
for death to the fascist insect that preys on the life of the people).
Aside from sleeping, screaming, and exercising, there’s also reading.
Federal SHUs generally have book carts that are rolled up the hallway
once a week; inmates crouch next to their door slots to view the
selections and point to what they want. Prison book carts are always
exciting, tending to be largely composed of donations from ancient
rural branch libraries that have just given up and closed down or
whatever, such that one can always expect to find a stray gem or
hilarious oddity. On one occasion I grabbed an award-winning 1962
volume on Jefferson by Dumas Malone in which the claim that the third
president engaged in a sexual relationship with the slave Sally
Hemings is dismissed as “wholly unwarranted.” But my best find to date
remains the early ’80s sci-fi novel I came across a couple of years
back in which the U.S. has fallen under a dystopian theocracy after
having rather unwisely elected a Mormon president.
Fortunately, SHU inmates are allowed to receive books through the mail
from commercial retailers just as we can in the prison itself, with
the only difference being that we can’t get hardcover books lest we
use them to make shanks. When the editors at The Intercept sent me a
hardback copy of the new Jonathan Franzen tome Purity last year, I was
only given it after a guard tore off the cover. This was a rather
upsetting thing to have witnessed, though halfway through the
narrative I was kind of wishing he’d finished the job.
I try to keep a copy of something by Hegel with me at all times as
well, not so much with the intent of reading it straight through, but
rather as a means by which to play a little game I’ve invented called
Shut the Fuck Up, Hegel, You Fucking Fraud. What you do is, you flip
to a random page in any volume of Hegel’s works and look for the
inevitable instance of hyper-oracular nonsense, such as this line I
just randomly came across from page 129 of Lectures on the Philosophy
of History:
    The spread of Indian culture is prehistorical, for history is
limited to that which makes for an essential epoch in the development
of spirit. On the whole, the diffusion of Indian culture is only a
dumb, deedless expansion, that is, without a political act. The people
of India have achieved no foreign conquests, but have been on every
occasion vanquished themselves.
Then you write in the margin, “Shut the fuck up, Hegel, you fucking
fraud.” And from page 51:
    What spirit really strives for is the realization of its own
concept; but in so doing it hides that goal from its own vision; it is
proud and quite enjoys itself in this alienation from itself.
“Whatever, douche.”
Indeed, to live in the hole is to be thrust into a world in which
everything must be repurposed and all possibilities pursued. One day I
decided to compose a list of unnecessary people throughout history and
had jotted down Ezra Pound, the Emperor Aurangzeb, Carlos Mencia,
Charles IV, and Gary Bauer when it became clear that I’d cast my net
too wide, at which point I abandoned the project. Instead I tried to
decide which city I’d destroy if I had the chance, other than Houston.
I eventually decided on Singapore, which I feel has been setting a bad
example for the other cities.
SHU time is a time for remembrance. I thought of all the strange and
interesting people I’d met throughout my incarceration, such as the
fellow who would conclude all of his assertions with the phrase, “Even
a small child knows that.” Among the things a small child knows, it
seems, is that sentences handed down for conspiracy to distribute
methamphetamines tend to be much harsher in Texas than in California
and that a particular guard who works the morning shift is kind of a
dick sometimes but not always. There was also the guy who feted me
with coffee and candy bars during a weeklong transit stop at a local
jail, at one point showing me the program from his father’s funeral a
few years prior; the cover bore a photo of a man dressed all in
yellow, right down to his cape and top hat, and who apparently went
only by the name Yellow Shoes. As noted in the program text, Yellow
Shoes was survived by well over 30 children. His father had been a
famous East Dallas pimp, my friend explained, somewhat unnecessarily.
Now he himself had been indicted as a drug dealer when in fact he was
a pimp like his father before him, something he planned to explain to
the judge at the first opportunity. Frankly, I’d say he had a strong
Finally, SHU inmates also spend some variable portion of each day
reflecting on the astonishing degree of injustice they’ve had the
chance to observe, as well as cultivating a healthy contempt for the
system that perpetrates that injustice and the society that continues
to permit it. Some months ago I asked The Intercept to file a Freedom
of Information Act request with the Bureau of Prisons in pursuit of
all records pertaining to yours truly in hopes of documenting further
instances of government misconduct to add to my collection. Recently
the BOP provided us with 175 pages, all of which we’ve posted online —
including the fully one-third that the BOP has completely redacted.
Tellingly, some clear and potentially criminal wrongdoing actually
crops up even among those pages that the agency has not gone so far as
to completely blank out, as we’ll see in a moment. First, let’s get
the vital statistics from Ben Brieschke of the BOP’s notoriously shady
South Central Regional Office, who prepared the cover letter:
    After a careful review, we determined 89 pages are appropriate for
release in full; 28 pages are appropriate for release in part; and,
[sic] 58 pages must be withheld in their entirety.
Most of these redactions are being justified under two FOIA
exemptions, one of which is intended for those files or portions
thereof “which would disclose techniques and procedures for law
enforcement investigations or prosecutions,” with the other pertaining
to those bits of information “which could reasonably be expected to
endanger the life or personal safety of an individual.” This latter
consideration certainly sounds serious, and one can get a sense of the
peril to which BOP staff are forever subject by the fact that first
names are blocked out with the “(b)(7)(F)” box throughout these
documents, lest they be tracked down by violent ex-prisoners or what
have you. One can likewise get a sense that even the BOP doesn’t buy
its own bullshit in this regard by the fact that it has failed to
block out the first name of a member of the BOP’s Special
Investigative Services (SIS) security division, and in another
document has left in the typed-out first, last, and middle names of
some dozen other officers and staff, an act of negligence that — what
was that phrase again? — “could reasonably be expected to endanger the
life or personal safety” of the individuals it itself has just fully
identified, if we take the BOP’s own word for it (though in my
infinite benevolence, I’ve asked The Intercept to block out the names
in question, for all men know of my great regard for the comfort and
well-being of American law enforcement officials).
Of course, the reality is that despite these names having sat on the
internet for weeks before I came across the regional office’s slip in
my paper copies and had them redacted, no one has been endangered by
the BOP’s incompetence here, as the (b)(7)(F) exemption is less a
necessary security measure than it is a convenient smokescreen by
which to cover up its own misconduct. And at many institutions,
employees tend to be less wary of inmates than they are of the
administration itself; when medical staff at several BOP prisons spoke
to USA Today earlier this year about the bureau’s despicable tendency
to regularly use them as prison guards rather than, say, having them
work full-time providing the medical care that’s already in short
supply, all of those coming forward chose to remain anonymous for fear
of retaliation.
Speaking of retaliation, have a look at this inmate progress report
prepared by two Fort Worth staff at the end of August 2015 in which I
am commended for my “good sanitation” and continued FRP payments (the
monthly restitution I’ve been ordered to pay to my corporate
“victims”). Elsewhere it’s noted that I’m “currently participating in
the GED program” (until recently the BOP refused to acknowledge that,
in addition to my good sanitation, I’m also a high school graduate; as
a result I had to sign up for high school equivalency classes). And
here are the signatures of the staff members in question, S.
Vanderlinden and M. Gutierrez, along with my own, perhaps not terribly
impressive signature. Now take a look at this other document composed
12 days later, after I’d been thrown in the hole again, and signed by
the very same two staff members, which I was never supposed to see.
Now it seems that I’ve shown “poor institutional adjustment,” “poor
program participation,” and even “poor living skills” — true enough if
we’re talking about signature design — and thus must be moved to a
medium security prison immediately.
This would be my new favorite illustration of the casual criminality
that has long marked the BOP’s operational culture had I not also
acquired this other, even more extraordinary specimen — the latest
response from the BOP regarding the Administrative Remedy complaint I
filed over a year ago regarding the retaliatory seizure of my email
access, the first of a string of bizarre incidents at Fort Worth that
would culminate in the confiscation of my notebook outside the law
library. As I’ve noted before, the Prison Litigation Reform Act of
1986 — passed during a period in which U.S. domestic policy was being
determined largely on the basis of questionable anecdotes — requires
that inmates who wish to sue the BOP and its employees first complete
an arcane and multilayered regimen of paperwork to the satisfaction of
the BOP and its employees. Inmates who find that the process itself is
being violated by the BOP and its employees are free to file another
complaint for review by the BOP and its employees. Astonishingly, this
process is not always free from abuse by the BOP and its employees.
When we last checked in on my own complaint about my email access
having been seized by BOP Washington liaison Terrance Moore an hour
after I’d used it to alert a journalist to BOP misconduct, the
regional office had rather despicably claimed that my appeal had been
late, even though it clearly hadn’t, as the failure by the warden’s
executive assistant Jerry McKinney to respond to my BP-9 form within
20 days of the day he logged it in, as well as his failure to request
the 20-day extension to his own deadline until well after his first
deadline had passed, as well as his failure to meet even that extended
deadline, allowed me to consider this a rejection at the institutional
level and freed me to proceed to the regional level, as is noted in
the BOP’s own policy guidelines — except that I couldn’t, because, as
I’ve also documented via forms signed and dated by McKinney himself,
McKinney failed to return the original documents to me for another
month despite messages I sent over the internal staff notification
system requesting that he do so.
Finally he brought me back a triply late and thus invalid rejection —
even handing it to me nine days after the date it was signed, as is
again documented by his own dating and signature. The regional
counsels know this fully well, and also know that just a few days
later I was placed in the SHU and thereafter shipped to Oklahoma for
processing and then to my current prison, where I filed my regional
appeal as soon as I received the box containing my legal papers. They
know this because, as I learned recently when I complained that the
BOP was now apparently violating the law by holding some of my mail
for nearly two weeks, I’m on some ultra-rare and secretive
classification known as “Inmates of Greatest Concern,” which requires
that everything I do be monitored and scrutinized for the benefit of
some unspecified outside agency.
Nonetheless, the region rejected my appeal due to it being “untimely,”
made an inappropriate request that I obtain “staff verification” that
this wasn’t my fault from staff at a prison I am accusing of
systematic retaliation and whom I have no means of contacting since
I’m no longer housed there, and demanded that my appeal be reduced to
a single typewritten page and resubmitted, all within 15 days of the
date of this rejection, which just happened to be 15 days prior to my
receipt of it. Thus I’d been given zero days to comply, including mail
I documented the entirety of this in a column months ago and wrote
back to the region’s legal counsel, explaining in detail why his
requests were impossible. Several weeks later I received another
rejection notice in which the counsel ignores my explanations and
maintains that I missed the deadline, although he himself seems
confused as to when that deadline actually was since he lists it as
having fallen on two different dates.
And just so I understand that the zero days thing wasn’t a mistake,
the rejection notice is dated December 4 — and they’d delayed mailing
it to me such that it didn’t even arrive at the warden’s office until
December 29. This time, then, I’d been given negative 10 days to
My email access was finally reinstated several months ago by the
security staff at my current prison, who immediately determined that
there was no legitimate reason why I shouldn’t have it; my continued
pursuit of this process is intended to force an admission of
wrongdoing from the BOP as well as to illustrate how it actually
operates. This, after all, is the only procedure by which my 200,000
fellow federal inmates are able to protect the last human rights
remaining to them, whether they’ve been subject to ongoing
retaliation, or they’ve been kept in the hole for years on end
contrary to law and all decency, or they’ve been beaten while in
handcuffs, or they’ve been denied basic medical care — all issues that
have been encountered by people I’ve known and interviewed over the
past few years. Here’s a list of grievances logged in at Fort Worth in
2014 and 2015, which we’ve obtained via another FOIA request; keep in
mind that for every complaint filed, there are dozens of incidents
that go undocumented because veteran inmates are aware of the near
impossibility of getting heard by the court under a system that can be
violated without consequences.
Imagine spending a year in the hole due to a mistake, trying all the
while to get a court to order your release, and getting back a demand
that you include two extra copies of a document and that you do this
six days ago. This sort of thing happens regularly, throughout the
system, although the problem appears to be particularly systematic in
this regional district.
The truly disturbing part is not that this happens in the first place,
but rather that it will likely continue happening despite now having
been fully documented. For it is not just the prisons that are broken,
but the media as well.
To help illustrate the manner in which the press has become largely
incapable of performing its necessary watchdog role even when large
parts of its job are done for it, and how certain parties have managed
to benefit from this state of affairs, next time we’ll discuss why it
is that I happen to be in prison. We’ll also talk about a man named
Peter Thiel. As it happens, these subjects are very much intertwined.
Quote of the Day:
“At the very outset we have the antithesis between the goal of the
state as the abstract generality on the one hand, and the abstract
person on the other; but when subsequently, in the course of history,
personality gains the ascendant, its breakup into atoms can only be
held together externally; then the subjective power of rule comes
forward as if summoned to fulfill this task. For abstract legality is
this; not to be concrete from within, not to have organization from
within; and this, having come to power, has only an arbitrary power as
contingent subjectivity as what moves it, as what rules it; and the
individual seeks in the developed private law solace for his lost
freedom. This the purely secular reconciliation of the antithesis.”

The Hegel quotes, especially the last one, are extremely reminiscent
of the sort of thing a university student might write having taken a
Benzedrine tablet the previous night before a test in the Philosophy
of History — obviously a mistake as witness the incoherence of the
types of thoughts resulting. So what might Hegel have been taking. I
do not think even in the original German the last quote could really
be said to have any meaning but rather pieces of meaning stuck
together by a beleaguered mind.
Great piece of writing by B. Brown. Eventually fitting all this
together in a book will be wise. Another Soul On Ice or Soul On

Always entertaining and enlightening BB.
A few questions came to mind-
How was the $890.000 or so in restitution calculated?
I saw no mention in the documents, nor whether it was being collected
for disbursement to the “victims” or kept by the state.
I’d appreciate it if anybody has a link… or perhaps BB will cover it
in the forthcoming piece he alluded to this round?
Why are they redacting publicly accessible news articles?
How is it that cursive is used by guards on these forms?
Is printing or at least legibility not a consideration?
How is that nobody else in the SHU is familiar with Dune?
I never understood the “grandfather” thing though… anybody?

She was talking to her grandfather on her mother’s side at the time.
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was Lady Jessica’s actual father under the
secret Bene Gesserit breeding program, and so Alia Atreides was his
the evil Baron’s granddaughter – just as her brother Paul, the Kwisatz
Haderach, was his grandson.

I should have expected that to be the question that gets answered.
Not that I don’t appreciate the reply.
OK, so why the big stink about Jessica only having daughters so the
two families could finally be brought together?
The grandfather thing seemingly makes that redundant… but also
explains the unexpected success of the breeding program.
It’s been 30 years or so since I read the book… maybe I should pick it up again.
The movie made no prior references to these facts.
Maybe it was too hard to suspend disbelief that the Baron could spawn
a beauty like Jessica.

“But grandchildren marrying each other makes Herbert a bit more
twisted than I remember.”
That’s just the modern perspective; it was pretty common in the era of
divine kings and queens – they didn’t want to pollute the royal blood
with that of commoners, so keeping it all in the family was not
unusual, accounting for the relatively high rate of inherited genetic
disorders in various royal dynasties.
Other good Frank Herbert quotes:
    “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the
little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I
will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone
past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has
gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
    (Dune)
    “We are plagued by a corrupt polity which promotes unlawful and/or
immoral behavior. Public interest has no practical significance in
everyday behavior among the ruling factions. The real problems of our
world are not being confronted by those in power. In the guise of
public service, they use whatever comes to hand for personal gain.
They are insane with and for power.”

It was never about just bringing any two families together in
particular so much as the Bene Gesserit were always trying to produce
a truly prescient male (that they could control) as a main goal of
their breeding program. By producing a son a generation or two earlier
than they wanted (for her Duke Leto Atreides) it meant they weren’t
yet prepared, it wasn’t at the time and place of their choosing and
they would never control him.
Back-story: The Reverend-Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam blackmailed The
Baron, who didn’t like women sexually, into their breeding program and
he was so angry he raped her violently. She in turn used her Bene
Gesserit abilities during the rape to get some revenge of her own and
infect him with the disease that then plagued him for decades, making

died at Alia’s hand from her personal Gom Jabbar. Jessica and the
BeneGesserit never told him Jessica was his daughter with Helen
Mohiam. And Alia was, after all, a Reverend Mother with access to
“other voices” (ancestors, mostly previous Reverend Mothers) from
before she was born, as Jessica went through the water of life
transformation while pregnant, making Alia what they called an
abomination. She knew from her ancestral voices within what he didn’t,
and informed him of it as he died.
Some of this back-story was filled in years later in a series of many
books written by Frank Herbert’s son Brian together with Kevin J.
Anderson. They’ve written some 14 books in the Dune Universe filling
in the complete back story of the Butlerian Jihad and the Great Houses
with prelude, including the Machine Universe of Omnius and Erasmus –
and even series far into the future of Frank’s original Dune. Um, I
guess I’ve sort of read them all – for decades now.
They’re in fact still at it with a couple more already in the works

Please, the Brian Herbert books are awful, awful, awful! One of the
most pathetic efforts to flog a parent’s name into a literary cash
payoff ever seen. Utter garbage, bottom of the barrel scrapings.
Frank Herbert had a real grasp of how dictatorships and empires rise
and fall, and he wove in ecology and history in a unique way. That
drivel produced by his son is embarrassingly bad in contrast.

Some weren’t that great, but some weren’t nearly as bad as some of
Frank’s own efforts either.
Especially in my younger years I devoured fantasy / sci-fi realms as a
form of escape, although less so for that reason the last decade so
much as author chasing. For instance, for a year or three in the ’08 –
’10 time frame I couldn’t get enough of R.A. Salvatore and read most
everything he ever wrote. When I read for entertainment or escape it’s
never about construct so much as storytelling and being taken
elsewhere, like with good music – if the storytelling transports you
places that can be enough.
And please yourself, btw, I never recommended the books or made any
claims about them whatsoever. But I’ll tell you this, I’ve never read
a single Brian Herbert / Kevin J. Anderson book of the Dune universe
as bad as Dune Messiah, which I read the year it was released, by
Frank Herbert himself.

Well, I was specifically referring to the dialogue in the movie where
Jessica was berated… I skipped the quotation marks due to uncertainty

I’m sure the movie isn’t true to the book, but your response suggests

My immediate inclination was to compare-and-contrast the above report
with the Russian prison complex as described in Don’t Trust Dont’ Fear
Don’t Beg, by Ben Stewart. I don’t think I’d like either one much,
although the Soviet system seems to have more opportunities for
cell-to-cell communication via the sock relay system – doroga. On the
other hand, the quality of the food in Russian prisons seems much
Here’s how the Greenpeace detainees were welcomed by the other
prisoners – an educational note:
    The best of day and time to you, all arrestees! Here is hoping
this note finds you in good health and strong of mood. Here is the
deal. There is us and there is them, there are thieves and there are
stars. The stars have stars on their shoulder plates, and those, dear
friends, are the guards. Then there is us, we are the arrestees. We
are the thieves. Now, the doroga is most important, it keeps us as
one, together, in solidarity. It is what keeps us alive. If there is
anything you need, you will have it. All you need do is ask. You will
not sell or buy things, no, you are expected to give. If you have
something, you give it. If you need it something, it will be given to
you. If you want to be a part of the doroga, you are welcome to join
our community of ropes, you will be supported, you will be given what
you need. If however you are afraid to be a part of the road, we
understand, and you will still be given support. But do not interfere
with the doroga. If you interfere with the road, you will be punished,
you will no longer be one of us, you will be one of them. You will no
longer be a thief. You become a star.
Here’s another nice feature of the Russian prison complex:
    “You are not permitted to be rude. Hard cursing is not allowed
against another prisoner. One is permitted to say, “I hate this
fucking shit” but you can’t say “Fuck you.” You will treat other
arrestees with respect.
Hilarious, Russian prisoners treat each other more politely than many
TI commentators do. Funny isn’t it? But then, those who engage in such
tactics are most likely “stars”, I’d say, out to disrupt conversations
– although when you have to share a cell with people, it’s probably
wiser to be polite. Food for thought?
Here’s another interesting feature of the Russian prison complex, one
that could be imported to the United States:
    Below that there’s another category. Former employees of law
enforcement agencies. Cops. Prosecutors. There are a lot of them in
prison, there’s lots of crime that goes on in that sector of society.
Bribery, murder, everything. And they end up here. They have their own
cells as well. They keep themselves to themselves, otherwise they tend
to get killed.
One of the reasons killer cops and dishonest prosecutors and dirty
federal agents from outfits like the FBI and DEA and ATF tend to avoid
prison time is that judges worry about their fate in prison; they’d be
hated by everyone. However, if you set up segregated prison units for
such people, the justice system might be more willing to throw them in
jail. Great idea, isn’t it? Works for the Russians, apparently.
Here’s some more good advice:
    “Don’t trust anybody in a uniform,” says Vitaly. “The more faith
you put in the authorities, the more it hurts when they screw you
over. To trust the police is to disrespect yourself. And don’t fear
because whatever you’re scared of, you can’t stop it happening. What
will be will be. Your fear changes nothing, but it hurts you, so let
it go. And don’t beg because it never works. Nobody ever begged their
way out of SIZO-1, so don’t sacrifice your dignity on a false promise.
There’s no point being nice to the guards, the investigator, the
prosecutor or the judge. Your pleading only makes them despise you
All in all, It seems like the U.S. federal prison complex is the more
Stalinist one, with all the solitary confinement games and efforts to
prevent prisoners from developing support networks and obsessive fears
along those lines; in addition the U.S. won’t put crooked members of
the justice system in jail, while the Russians do.
Again, thanks for the report from the inside.

How are they petty and jabs when he’s the one publishing them for all
to see. At least I read them! You should as well, they give you a much
better idea of what happens.
Here’s some other facts from his file, some of which are just the full
quotations that he referenced in his article:
* “Mr. Brown has maintained poor institutional adjustment since his
arrival at this facility on February 25, 2015. He has received two
Greatest severity level Incident Reports.”
* “His security level increased as a result of poor program
participation, poor living skills, and three Incident reports.”
* Barrett has paid less than one percent of his restitution.
* When busted on opiate use, stated: “I am guilty, I did it.”
Sanctions included 90-day loss of phone, email, commissary (ouch),
visits (man, that’s harsh), and 30 days in the hole. “Inmate
Brown…displayed a poor attitude during this investigation.” Barrett’s
characterization of taking the morphine pill: “I’m afraid I’m back in
the hold after failing my latest ‘random’ drug test which tested
positive for one of the little morphine pills that people sell here. I
know it was stupid of me, so it’s not necessary for everyone to
explain that to me again. Please keep in mind that I’m an untreated
substance abuser living in a ??? with literally a thousand drug
* Two months before this, Barrett was placed in the hole for alcohol
use. An officer searched “Brown’s locker and found a coffee mug full
of homemade intoxicants” which “tested .400 with the Alco-sensor IV”
(potent!!) When the officer questioned Brown if he was intoxicated he
responded. “No, but have you?” (LOL). “He bought it from the hooch
distributor within the unit.” “At his hearing he stated “I’m guilty.”
This time “he displayed a fair attitude during the investigation.”
* So to put this in a timeline, Barrett got sent to the hole for
alcohol in June 2015. He got out in July 2015. One month later he was
back in the hole for drugs.
* Despite his abuse issues and comments about being untreated, his
August 2015 Progress report says “Mr. Brown declined interest in the
Residential Drug Abuse Program. He has not participated in any drug
education programs.” The next review indicates he has to “enroll and
complete the 100-hour drug abuse program within 12 months. Remain
incident free until next review.”

that they don’t know any way to express it other than fawning and
drooling all over his articles. As if his pariah status renders his
articles immune to criticism. They don’t seem to mind that in spite of
Barrett’s intentions to “expose wrongdoing” in the prison system, he
himself keeps breaking the rules and doing wrong. He mostly takes the
low hanging fruit: talks about screaming in the SHU for comedic
purposes, when a lot of people in SHU are mentally ill and not just
creating funny material for TI; the guards are morons, admin staff
cannot spell, etc.
So as is clear, I don’t sympathize with Barrett’s self-inflicted

It really doesn’t matter what you think. Your safety isn’t at stake.

university of higher education.
Having gone all the way through the 9th grade, I read Dune. While I
enjoyed the book, I could detect no semblance between it and ‘the

a fox and a rooster and a bag of corn but can only take one at a time
across the river in his boat and the fox will eat the rooster and the
rooster will eat the corn if either pair is left together unattended
(the solution, incidentally, is to shoot the fox, because it’s a fox).

On both... Are you fucking kidding me?
Even before Snowden censored himself and Assange got locked down...
He's one of the outspoken few that was still out traveling around the world
bringing knowledge of Tor / privacy / human rights / surveillance etc the
whole scope... with zero fear and a solid compelling presentation based
on personal conviction and experience. Others at Tor mostly stayed
to the conference rooms, he was transcending personal rooms even
before joining Tor...
Here he is talking on the subject with a roomful of Muslims in Quwait...
And you want to know who wants to take him down, and how?
Get real. Get fucking real.

in the future even if someone doing it fell into their lap.
It's too hot topic, and they'll be too busy playing politik

People should learn those concepts. A lot of success is tied to them.
Bid systems can reduce costs to the buyers, and can even include
insurance on contractual performance of obligations by bidders.
Performance incentives could take many forms.
That's something a lot of people read AP haven't yet grown beyond...
The potential application isn't just assassinations, or dark predictions...
but democratically produced outcomes, and VC funded side expeditions.
As with existing systems today, the procurement needs of general
populations will end up greatly outweighing the minor background noise
of things like murder for hire.

Tonga (Bridge Authority) Permanent Shutdown Notice
Dear friends,
Given recent events, it is no longer appropriate for me to materially
contribute to the Tor Project either financially, as I have so
generously throughout the years, nor by providing computing resources.
This decision does not come lightly; I probably ran one of the first
five nodes in the system and my involvement with Tor predates it being
called "Tor" by many years.
Nonetheless, I feel that I have no reasonable choice left within the
bounds of ethics, but to announce the discontinuation of all
Tor-related services hosted on every system under my control.
Most notably, this includes the Tor node "Tonga", the "Bridge
Authority", which I recognize is rather pivotal to the network
Tonga will be permanently shut down and all associated crytographic
keys destroyed on 2016-08-31. This should give the Tor developers
ample time to stand up a substitute. I will terminate the chron job we
set up so many years ago at that time that copies over the
In addition to Tonga, I will shut down a number of fast Tor relays,
but the directory authorities should detect that shutdown quickly and
no separate notice is needed here.
I wish the Tor Project nothing but the best moving forward through
those difficult times,

i use yahoo to mail with mailinglists but i use TOR to connect to yahoo.
tuns out that all my posts now end up in everyones spam folders.
Is this because the tor exitnodes are used by spammers?
or is every mail that was send from a TOR user falsely marked as spam?
also the subscription confirmation email i received from this list
ended up in yahoo's spam.
So now i also wonder how many people on this list are not receiving
THIS message.
I'm NOT a spammer. Can i sue yahoo for falsely tagging my mails as
spam?  or better can TOR sue Yahoo? :-D and win and get a lot of money
to put into development?
please have a look at dmarc.org it tries to explain in lawyer-ish
speak how the yahoo, gmail, facebook aol, paypal, ebay, amazon cartel
teamed together to force people to 'autenticate'
authenticate as in ...get a code that they can use to invade our
privacy. (or is this my brain going into paranoia mode?)
can this be fixed?
Or do we need a new email protocol that respects privacy by default,
decentralized, with whitelist and request to communicate and
eventually a blacklist to be able to block extreme cases.
is it enough to move away from yahoo, or will the same stuff happen
when using another email provider?
Thanks for improving my privacy!

I never liked those statements. I don't expect the user to know
why I or we don't, that takes an investment. But at least give
them a damn link right there alongside them that says
"Learn about the limitations of Tor" or something similar,
out to a nice open wiki page on the subject so they can start.
Not just "Learn more about Tor" out to an overview containing
a tiny "staying anonymous" section with no links, docs or
text to further support itself.
Even in there "fast enough for web browsing" is a bad qualifier.
Creating concise correct current text that holds up to parsing
is work, and there are degrees involved. But in a leading "privacy"
and "anonymity" app with certain remarked use cases beyond
surfing example.com all day, not doing so as an integrated
project component is kinda unexcusable.
Interesting to note that because former reasonably well
known and accepted decades of humanitarian investment
by some of these states has been reinvested into decades
of things like drone strikes... it makes it harder for projects
like Tor to freely make the case that their project existance
and use case is even valid for human rights and so on when
states are trending bashing those rights and their validity.
Right of anonymity and privacy, let alone legal and technical
extant versions of same, seems a very tenuous thing. And the
latter especially, is not something you can just brush on a
frontpage and say it exists.

18 July 2016
Cloudflare reCAPTCHA De-anonymizes Tor Users
A sends:
Cloudflare's insistence on solving reCAPTCHA puzzles when visitors are
coming from Tor exit nodes to one of the 2 million web sites that
Cloudflare 'protects' can be very instrumental for traffic analysis
and de-anonymizing of Tor users.
This is how:
The only non-public prerequisite for the de-anonymizing entity is the
ability to monitor traffic between ISPs and Tor entry nodes, and
traffic entering Cloudflare servers (no decryption required in either
case). There are, of course, no 2 million Cloudflare servers, probably
there is no more than few hundred.
Each click on one of the images in the puzzle generates a total of
about 50 packets between Tor user's computer and the Cloudflare's
server (about half are requests and half are real-time responses from
the server.) All this happens in less than a second, so eventual
jitter introduced in onion mixing is immaterial. The packet group has
predictable sizes and patterns, so all the adversary has to do is note
the easily detectable signature of the "image click" event, and
correlate it with the same on the Cloudflare side. Again, no
decryption required.
There likely are many simultaneous users (thousands), but they do not
solve puzzles at the same time, and they do not click on the puzzle
image at the same time. Simple math shows that disambiguating is
trivial. If there is some ambiguity left, Cloudflare can conveniently
serve few more images to specific users (or even random users, as long
as within the same few seconds different users get different amount of
'correct' images.)
This obvious opportunity is not the proof, but NSA would have to be
utterly incompetent not to be exploiting it. No one is that

    Hey,
    Lucky announced[0] that he is quitting all his Tor involvement including
    operation of Tonga and several relays. The relays should not cause any
    problems, but we need to deploy a new bridge auth asap, make sure it can
    transfer descriptors as the current one does etc.
    We need a supremely trusted operator for this, as they see sensitive
    data that they shouldn't lose, as well as someone who is able to provide
    a very high-availability system because bridge auth works quite
    differently compared to the dirauth system.
    Nevertheless, this will cause severe disruption for the bridge ecosystem
    as our users typically take a long time to update their version of Tor.
    We should strive to have this set up very soon and included in a Tor
    release well before Aug 31, and yet it will still cause disruptions.
    The above is just my take on the whole thing and I'm somewhat shocked by
    the development.

US IRS rules prevent that to such degree that any btc anons get
beyond trivial limits will not be coming from the audited corporate
wallet. While tor may be hodling legacy btc, donations are currently
going via bitpay probably set to convert it all straight to usd with
no holdback. Nor does tor corp have any real need for anons. And
even if the board welcomed anons philosophically, lawyers would
probably block it citing risk, liability, and other scary stuff.

Last month, law enforcement officers showed up at the lab of Anil
Jain, a professor at Michigan State University. Jain wasn’t in
trouble; the officers wanted his help.
Jain is a computer science professor who works on biometric
identifiers such as facial recognition programs, fingerprint scanners
and tattoo matching; he wants to make them as difficult to hack as
possible. But the police were interested in the opposite of this: they
wanted his help to unlock a dead man’s phone.
Jain and his PhD student Sunpreet Arora couldn’t share details of the
case with me, since it’s an ongoing investigation, but the gist is
this: a man was murdered, and the police think there might be clues to
who murdered him stored in his phone. But they can’t get access to the
phone without his fingerprint or passcode. So instead of asking the
company that made the phone to grant them access, they’re going
another route: having the Jain lab create a 3D printed replica of the
victim’s fingers. With them, they hope to unlock the phone.
And Jain said he was happy to help when they got in touch: “We do it
for the fun.”

The Roosevelt authors say a key factor is the concentration of
resources in the hands of managers and owners of large
corporations—think of CEOs who are compensated largely in shares of
the firms they oversee. This ownership encourages them to skimp on
labor costs to further enrich themselves, in their analysis. That
shrinking demand for labor then helps depress job-market dynamism. It
also contributes to broader secular stagnation, since wealthier people
tend to save more of their incomes.
1) Eventually, and probably pretty soon (within 100years), that there
obviously won't be jobs for everyone. Automation, progress(efficiency
gains) and increasing population makes it inevitable.
2) That a general "goal" of society is do away with jobs. In any
traditional sense. To me we've been approaching that ever since
agriculture provided ability to support specialists (those who don't
spend time gathering/producing the food/resources they need). Such as
scientists, artists and soldiers. The jobs keep moving "up" the ladder
(away from production). Previous low-rung jobs get reduced in number
by efficiency or replaced via automation. The end of this trend is
that all basic needs are met by 0 to a tiny fraction of a percent of
human labor and rest are all free to pursue specialist activities such
as science, art, and killing each other.

BlackBerry CEO John Chen said he is "disturbed" by Apple's tough
approach to encryption and user privacy, warning that the firm's
attitude is harmful to society. Earlier this year, Chen said in
response to Apple resisting the government's demands to unlock an
iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters: "We are indeed
in a dark place when companies put their reputations above the greater
good." During BlackBerry's Security Summit in New York this week, Chen
made several more comments about Apple's stance on encryption. "One of
our competitors, we call it 'the other fruit company,' has an attitude
that it doesn't matter how much it might hurt society, they're not
going to help," he said. "I found that disturbing as a citizen. I
think BlackBerry, like any company, should have a basic civil
responsibility. If the world is in danger, we should be able to help
out." He did say there was a lot of "nonsense" being reported about
BlackBerry and its approach to how it handles user information. "Of
course, there need to be clear guidelines. The guidelines we've
adopted require legal assets. A subpoena for certain data. But if you
have the data, you should give it to them," he said. "There's some
complete nonsense about what we can and can't do. People are mad at us
that we let the government have the data. It's absolute garbage. We
can't do that." Chen also warned that mandatory back doors aren't a
good idea either, hinting at the impending Investigatory Powers Bill.
"There's proposed legislation in the U.S., and I'm sure it will come
to the EU, that every vendor needs to provide some form of a back
door. That is not going to fly at all. It just isn't," he said.
It should be noted that blackberry is losing government
sales due in part to its lineup of ancient and unsupported phones.

To avoid enforcement efforts, pirate sites often go to extremes to

Digital Authentication Guideline
Authentication and Lifecycle Management
This document and its companion documents, SP 800-63-3, SP 800-63A,
and SP 800-63C, provide technical and procedural guidelines to
agencies implementing electronic authentication to choose and
implement effective authentication processes based on risk. The
recommendation covers remote authentication of users (such as
employees, contractors, or private individuals) interacting with
government IT systems over open networks. It defines technical
requirements for each of the three authenticator assurance levels.
If the out of band verification is to be made using a SMS message on a
public mobile telephone network, the verifier SHALL verify that the
pre-registered telephone number being used is actually associated with
a mobile network and not with a VoIP (or other software-based)
service. It then sends the SMS message to the pre-registered telephone
number. Changing the pre-registered telephone number SHALL NOT be
possible without two-factor authentication at the time of the change.
OOB using SMS is deprecated, and will no longer be allowed in future
releases of this guidance.

unlock their iPhone using their fingerprint in order to give
investigators access to data which can be used as evidence against
them. The first time this ever happened in a federal case was back in
May, following a District Court ruling in 2014. The legal position of
forcing suspects to use their fingerprints to unlock devices won't be
known with certainty until a case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, but
lower court rulings so far appear to establish a precedent which is at
odds with that concerning passcodes. Most constitutional experts
appear to believe that the Fifth Amendment prevents a suspect from
being compelled to reveal a password or passcode, as this would amount
to forced self-incrimination -- though even this isn't certain.
Fingerprints, in contrast, have traditionally been viewed as 'real or
physical evidence,' meaning that police are entitled to take them
without permission.

encryption "backdoor," sidestepping a concern of computer-security

the encryption standards rolled back to the point where the companies
themselves can decrypt devices, but police cannot. This situation
existed until September 2014, when Apple pushed out iOS 8, which Apple
itself cannot decrypt. "Tim Cook was absolutely right when he told his

The Tor Project Social Contract
THE TOR SOCIAL CONTRACT
At The Tor Project, we make tools that help promote and protect the
essential human rights of people everywhere. We have a set of guiding
principles that make that possible, but for a long time, those
principles were more or less unspoken. In order to ensure that project
members build a Tor that reflects the commitment to our ideals, we've
taken a cue from our friends at Debian and written the Tor Social
Contract -- the set of principles that show who we are and why we make
Our social contract is a set of behaviors and goals: not just the
promised results we want for our community, but how we achieve them.
We want to grow Tor by supporting and advancing these guidelines in
our Tor time, while taking care not to undermine them in the rest of
our time. The principles can also be used to help recognize when
people's actions or intents are hurting Tor. Some of these principles
are established norms, things we've been doing every day for a long
time, while others are more aspirational -- but all of them are values
we want to live in public, and we hope it will make our future choices
easier and more open. This social contract is just one of several
documents that define our community standards, so if you're looking
for things that aren't here (e.g., something that might be in a code
of conduct) bear in mind that content might be in a different
Social goals can be complex. If there is ever tension in the
application of the following principles we will always strive to place
highest priority on the safety and freedom of any who would use the
fruits of our endeavors. The social contract can also help us work
through such tensions -- for example, there are times when we might
have a need to use tools that are not completely open (contradicting
point 2) but opening them would undermine our users' safety
(contradicting point 6). Using such a tool should be weighed against
how much it's needed to make our technologies usable (point 1). And if
we do use such a tool, we must be honest about its capabilities and
limits (point 5).
Tor is not just software, but a labor of love produced by an
international community of people devoted to human rights. This social
contract is a promise from our internal community to the rest of the
world, affirming our commitment to our beliefs. We are excited to
present it to you.
1. We advance human rights by creating and deploying usable anonymity
and privacy technologies
We believe that privacy, the free exchange of ideas, and access to
information are essential to free societies. Through our community
standards and the code we write, we provide tools that help all people
protect and advance these rights.
2. Open and transparent research and tools are key to our success
We are committed to transparency; therefore, everything we release is
open and our development happens in the open. Whenever feasible, we
will continue to make our source code, binaries, and claims about them
open to independent verification. In the extremely rare cases where
open development would undermine the security of our users, we will be
especially vigilant in our peer review by project members.
3. Our tools are free to access, use, adapt, and distribute
The more diverse our users, the less simply being a user of Tor
implies about any user, so we aim to create tools that anyone can
access and use. We do not restrict access to our tools unless it is
for the security of all users, and we design, build, and deploy our
tools without collecting identifiable information about our users. We
expect the code and research we publish to be improved by many
different people, and that is only possible if the tools are free of
cost and free to use, copy, modify and redistribute.
4. We make Tor and related technologies ubiquitous through advocacy
and education
We are not just people who build software, but ambassadors for online
freedom. We want everybody in the world to understand that their human
rights, particularly of free speech, freedom to access information,
and privacy, do not have to disappear when they use the internet, and
we do this by teaching people why and how to use Tor. We are always
working to make our tools both more secure and more usable, which is
why we use our own tools and listen to user feedback. Our vision of a
more free society will not be accomplished simply behind a computer
screen, and so in addition to writing good code, we also prioritize
community outreach and advocacy.
5. We are honest about the capabilities and limits of Tor and related
We never intentionally mislead our users nor misrepresent the
capabilities of the tools, nor the potential risks associated with
using them. Every user should be free to make an informed decision
about whether they should use a particular tool and how they should
use it. We are responsible for accurately reporting the state of our
software, and we work diligently to keep our community informed
through our various communication channels.
6. We will never willfully harm our users
We take seriously the trust our users have placed in us. Not only will
we always do our best to write good code, but it is imperative that we
resist any pressure from adversaries who want to harm our users. We
will never implement front-doors or back-doors into our projects. In
our commitment to transparency, we are honest when we make errors, and
we communicate with our users about our plans for improvement.

# 22C3: Personal experiences bringing technology and new media to disaster areas
Welcome IRAQ!
Streamtime.org - Free as a fish
Haan al-Irsaal (Arabic for Streamtime), was born in the spring of 2004
when in the attic of Cultural Political centre De Balie in Amsterdam
two journalists and a hacker joined their forces with the purpose to
promote independent, free speech web-radio and blogging from war-torn
Iraq and its Diaspora.
Today and after many years, Streamtime consists of a rich collection
of on-line sound recordings collected between 2004 and 2010, some
rather complex memories, huge archives stored off-line and a network
of good friends. It is a unique narration about the many Iraqi
bloggers who where online since the beginning of the war in Iraq.
We focused on a cultural sense of finding our own way in the quagmire
that is Iraq, and its representation in the global media. We don't try
to change politics in order to foster cultural change; we support
cultural manifestation in order to force political change.
We imagine improvised expressive devices like a CD that turns your PC
into an on line streaming studio. Imagine a mob that creates a traffic
jam. Think of the religious policeman in London, the konfused kollege
kid and the jealous dentist in Baghdad and the jailed blogger in
Cairo. Building autonomous networks in extreme conditions.

Researchers have speculated that GCHQ may have the capability to
deanonymise Tor users by examining the timing of connections going in
and out of the Tor network.
there is clear evidence that timing information is both recognized as
being key to correlating events and streams; and it is being recorded
and stored at an increasing granularity. There is no smoking gun as of
2011 to say they casually de-anonymize Tor circuits, but the writing
is on the wall for the onion routing system. GCHQ at 2011 had all
ingredients needed to trace Tor circuits. It would take extra-ordinary
incompetence to not have refined their traffic analysis techniques in
the past 5 years. The Tor project should do well to not underestimate
GCHQâs capabilities to this point.
one should wonder why we have been waiting for 3 years until such
clear documents are finally being published from the Snowden
revelations. If those had been the first published, instead of the
obscure, misleading and very non-informative slides, it would have
saved a lot of time â and may even have engaged the public a bit more
than bad powerpoint.

True regarding physical or network compromise of nodes,
however that is single purpose and not very efficient attack.
Instead, this is traffic analysis by GPA's and cooperating GPA's.
They have their illegal, unethical, multipurpose mass surveillance
network taps all over the planet. Even if your path was from Canada
in (to Venezuela to China to Russia out) to Mexico, they don't have
to have taps in any of those countries, only on transit that has
visability of the IP's / points of interest, typically just the endpoints.
There's nothing you can do about it but
- start researching and using networks that use fill traffic
- shut down those GPA's and their activities against you
It is those out of control self aware self preserving entities
with their secret games interpretations etc, that will lessen,

Perhaps different terms for same derivative thing?
Fill traffic needs store and forward with random delay, for low latency
requirements it could be called reclocking with jitter, rearchitecting
for higher latency adds additional bounds on time to the interval
and jitter clocks. Packet / message oriented / UDP seems useful
to remove constraints of TCP-in-TCP allowing for management
of fill traffic, multipath traffic spreading, pluggables, and so on.
Ineffective is say rearchitecting web "services" to deliver a tarball
of a website for offline reading, if said delivery is over a traditional
non fill network, it will be TA'd.
Fill / chaff seem needed, otherwise in an all wheat network,
input traffic on one side seems to match output traffic on the
other side at some point, regardless of storage / delay.
Fixed packet sizes seem to help.
Fill ratios up to 100% utilization can mask the wheat.
Minimum fill is amount needed for plausible deniability
that single input can't be mapped to a single output.
ie: 10MiB in, must have at least two outputs that
received 10MiB.
Is there any group / list that is actively researching
or developing such networks? Or that wants to?

What does this help / enable?
Nodes are known to GPA's, there is no way to hide them.
If GPA counting physical packets, over time period, bytes into a
relay must equal bytes out, otherwise they're being dropped
somewhere, which is inefficient... as opposed to temporarily
reducing fill to cover wheat demand.
There is up to %50 capacity loss with random sizes,
requiring up to 2x higher packet / interrupt rates to compensate
within the same pipe / cpu. And the code to do all the
carving, queuing and reassembly of every single packet, more
complex and costly than padding the last carrier packet
of some layer.
There is also to consider...
- physical / logical paths and pathing
- circuit, packet, label, or flow switching
- what layers the fill is in (above, at, or below wheat),
the layers managed at, and by who.
Big challenge is figuring how the network self
manages the fill system to dynamically make room
for wheat demand wherever it is needed in the network.
(That dynamic is also what makes the user apparent
application performance roughly the same as non fill
networks. Of course their NIC (or their configured
anonymous network rate limit within that), is always
saturated, but that's transparent to the application
If that's all solved fill traffic might be a good defense to
Global *Passive* Adversary, and even a fair one to a
Global *Traffic Flow Perturbing Active* Adversary.
(What evidence is there that Global Adversaries
that are not partnered with Global Telecoms are able
to, as opposed to simply listening, arbitrarily drop /
inject / delay packets on the global backbones?)
Designing something new, including fill, crypto, and anonymity...
probably far harder than putting tor's basic design together was.
On the other hand, there's now 15 more years of research,
experience and components on hand to throw at it.

On global backbones...
Inject / drop / delays require a complete fiber cut and insertion
of active hardware capable of selecting traffic. A carrier that
cares about such things must not ignore their line diagnostics.
If you had insane alien tap tech capable of precise timing,
invading wavelengths, and faster-than-subject-fiber processing
and transmission... dropping could be done without cut by laser
corrupting CRC / addresses with gain hits or losses, whiteout, etc...
injection is similar, delay is drop and injection.
Adversaries couldn't do sneaky blackbag shit to the fiber
if carriers would encrypt all their links, like Google now says
it does internally.
All bets are off if the carrier is partner with, or under threat of,
adversary... regarding global telecoms (remember Qwest),
this paragraph seems the most likely of all the above.

If I remember right you're doing file caching / serving
in the browsers-as-torrent-nodes layer. Yes that
asynchronous would seem to break end to end timing.
But the 654321012 byte file "into one tor circuit" from
user at one end would still count same bytes out to
a "reasynching end point" user at the other end.
(Or users plural if requested by more than one user).
Between otherwise relatively quiet endpoints / users.
If they are all shuffling around encrypted bits fulltime,
without being driven to do so by end user demand,
such that the start and stop of the bytes of the poster
and requestor[s] can't be delineated, that looks more
generally like the fill traffic.

Doesn't work.
"never exits" - GPA's don't necessarily need to correlate any internal
flows. They can look only at the endpoints. The minute you insert
traffic that lights up some other endpoint, in an otherwise sufficiently
quiet network, or distinguishable way (bytes / latency [pump], which is
made even easier for them if they reign over an endpoint), you're done.
You need fulltime regulated fill traffic, within which, your traffic resides.

While money can buy shill humans to stand in, as below, it's

Govt seems to have no issue doing such illegal / unethical things.
And they certainly can use their own network, tor, to do it.
This is suggested often on tor-talk. And tor devs continually
pass on it.
Not really. Tor already loads GeoIP. So 20 or so lines
of code and you've got a separate country for
each hop. A few more lines to define groups like
FVEY / BRICS, hemispheres, regions, AS, etc.
Users could isolate on whatever they wanted.
And a bunch more lines to include attributes as to
"verified to be a human node operator in person"
pki web of trust into the consensus. At least that
way it raises the cost and risk to adversaries who
today just use their Govt credit card to order up
VPS nodes all over the world.
Does it benefit? Tor devs say trust the random node selection.
Others say at least some subset of users know the / their
environment better and could use such tools to advantage.
Tor still refuses to do it.
So like mixmaster, you have to do it yourself.
That sucks.

I2P embedded client is a webfront toy that does not scale.
Define scale as 100 to 1000+ torrents loaded in the app's
index for seeding.
This is known. Hopefully it ends up being lighter.
Onioncat 80 is harder in I2P due to I2P address width..
There needs to be a better wider more cross darknet
inclusive solution, but as you may know, that's already up
for grabs in a recent former thread you can easily find / participate.
As a minimal tool for small users of a few torrents.
It scales worse than the combo Tor + Onioncat UDP + Transmission,
plus opentracker forming initial meetup space to prime into PEX / DHT.
Which people are also using right now today,
entirely within Tor, and linked to some other networks
via other tunnel interfaces which I won't bother to detail here.
See dark docs.
Didn't write it, don't share all its plan either.
In particular, dislike every clearnet app on the planet having to
link against library for this net, library for that net, deal with Tor's
stupid lack of anything but TCP transport, talk socks5, not
be peertopeer endtoend bidirectional, etc over these darknets.
Leads to social balkanization and one-net specific apps like
each darknet creating dinky little private tools like Snark.
Not knocking i2p / snark, knocking lack of vision and cooperation
to make apps interoperable across many darknets at once.
As important as competitive race, is inclusion.
Which yields faster adoption.
Similar to how the subject line is yielding faster adoption
among some percent of the 100M+ torrenters out there.

@_subject: Rebel Cities Rejecting Surveillance 
Renata Avila
Guatemalan Human Rights Lawyer,  Advisory Board and
 Board
The city of the future I see in promotional videos for systems of mass
surveillance and mass control seems to be subsumed in a permanent
state of normalcy. It is a city with no traffic, no protests, no
visible disasters, no spontaneous mobilisations, no surprises.
Spontaneous events, as if they were system errors, are suppressed
before they occur. Movement analysis and decision-making happens in a
control room that looks like a spaceship, where technicians work in
real-time, watching all of us, without us being able to see them.
There is no citizen access. To the contrary, these are closed systems,
difficult to monitor. Where actions are regulated by a system,
designed elsewhere, that pretends it is not political. But technology
is political.
Cities where everything is controlled by invisible technology, almost
imperceptible in daily life. Those surveillance cameras now visible on
street corners are replaced by systems of constant monitoring
integrated in the landscape. Cities of sensors collecting our data all
day long, where each movement is registered and stored, where
decisions are automated and dehumanised. Monetised to optimise
consumption, predict behavior. Control people. And where the benefits
of not knowing who decides and why, stand to be gained by the same
conglomerate who bets on this vision. A few companies developing
software, hardware and capacities in countries that can be counted on
one hand. A market of US$8 billion, which is expected to grow tenfold
by the year 2020. Fed with meager public funds from countries like
ours [in Latin America].
Although discourses keep feeding the imaginary, descriptions of
cameras detecting pickpockets, this is something radically different.
Matrices that combine lots of data in real-time. This vision for the
city of the future, promoted by a small group of technology
conglomerates, is one where quality of life is directly proportional
to the predictability and homogeneity of its inhabitants, clashing
with the struggle for diversity and diverse behaviors. To achieve this
vision, much more is sacrificed than privacy. We pawn off our security
to those in the sealed-off control room. It is to sacrifice the purest
form of democracy we have, our right to protest freely and anonymously
in the town square.
Local surveillance systems are rapidly expanding across Latin America.
Much earlier and faster than the regulatory frameworks for adequate
protection of privacy and personal data. Without democratic
mechanisms, community or neighbourhood consultations to determine
their necessity or appropriateness. They are sophisticated and
ephemeral systems that require updates and costly maintenance and show
vague results. In Tegucigalpa, Honduras, for example, the city could
not maintain the surveillance system due to a lack of budget to
maintain the cameras.
The contracts that are signed tie the hands of more than one public
institution, borrowing from future municipal budgets, with a
coordinated marketing and data machinery that does not offer solid
evidence to prove effectiveness. Public authorities assure us that
cameras, scenario modeling and mass surveillance will eliminate the
problem of insecurity, advancing these over other public policies
meant to attack extreme poverty and inequality of access to basic
services, as well as the recovery of public space. The studies that
vouch for the effectiveness of surveillance as a crime reduction
measure are incomplete; they do not take local internal and external
factors into account, and cannot be applied to different contexts.
Cities of the future, promoted by the conglomerates benefitting from
them, allow for events to be preempted, for preventive decisions to be
made to control the masses, block protests, predict civic
mobilisations for more and better rights. To discriminate by
algorithm. To exclude by patterns of behavior.
Do we want a future without surveillance? A future where diversity,
and not uniformity of behavior, is the rule? Letâs start by
eradicating (the now invisible) vigilante culture of the neighbourhood
and the city. Letâs start by participating in all public spaces and if
they do not exist, letâs open them. Before the final bastion of
democracy becomes a memory erased by someone behind a screen. Among
the steps we can all take, here are three I will elaborate on:
Prevent the arrival of surveillance
If mass surveillance is still at the exploratory stage as a security
measure, it is important to organise neighbours against it, asking if
municipal goods or services will be sacrificed in favor of
surveillance, and question the impact that prioritising it will have
on community and neighbourhood life. Moreover, it is important to ask
about the long-term sustainability and viability of such projects, the
conditions by which the municipality is acquiring them and the time
frames. It is important to quantify what is being sacrificed to invest
in surveillance. For example, indicating how many programs for
children and youth at risk could be started for the same price,
offering more complete and long-term solutions. Once a mass
surveillance system is installed, privacy and intimacy are only for
those who can afford them.
Question mass surveillance already installed and the costs of
maintenance and updates
Decisions to improve security and quality of life of neighbourhoods
and cities should be participatory. The benefits of installing mass
and continuous surveillance mechanisms in public space should be
weighed against analog, social alternatives. Technological
surveillance is expensive because for every camera installed there are
not just related fixed costs for maintenance and updates, there is
also a sacrifice in terms of public spending on social programs.
Moreover, almost all the technology providers are not domestic
companies. Mostly closed technology, running on proprietary software,
makes effective citizen oversight impossible. Contracts with camera
providers and services are generally in the millions of dollars, and
are binding long beyond the term of the signing government, without
considering the realities of a municipality.
Connect with other rebel cities and collectives
To free ourselves from surveillance and other repressive and
authoritarian forms of power that this opens up, we must immediately
activate the mechanisms of law that allow us to oversee the functions
of mass surveillance systems in our cities. And do this collectively,
in coordination with other cities affected by the problem. Just as
there are Smart Cities networks we should form our own Rebel Cities
networks where surveillance is rejected and participatory democracy is
affirmed, a democracy framed in respect for human rights and
diversity, focused on collective solutions, which is the true path to
safer cities. Not cameras.
We can then simultaneously activate collaborative mechanisms to
prevent their expansion. Make freedom of information requests for
public information detailing their costs. Demand studies on their
results. Take serious legal action in face of possible illegal uses of
surveillance for discriminatory policies. Demand from authorities
protection of personal data where it exists, and where it does not,
demand that human rights authorities undertake feasibility studies,
weighing the impact on individual guarantees before installing
systems. Democracy begins and ends there. In its exercise.

References: <31189.1466126114
---------- Forwarded message ----------
[[ Up front confession:  I know essentially nothing about radio. ]]
Just a short while ago, I saw a Vice News video titled "State of Surveillance"
in which Snowden brought up the fact that some journalists had found and
outted some stingrays (IMSI Catchers) which had, apparently, been operating
in some very sensitive areas of Oslo, Norway, for an unknown amount of time,
managed by unknown people, for unknown purposes.
That was the first that I personally had ever heard about that, so I googled
it and found a lot of information about it online.
I started to wonder about the fact that these Norwegian journalists were
able to pull together the hardware and software necessary to detect the
various anomalies that indicated the presence of these multiple stingrays
in the Oslo city center.
I googled some more and found the following blog article, written by
Bruce Schneier, in which he notes that these days, pretty much anybody
could easily build their own stingray, presumably out of an off-the-
shelf computer and a reasonably cheap ($330 USD) little box called a
So, after that I was thinking that perhaps someone already has!  Or better
yet, perhaps someone has already written the code necessary to turn, for
example, an ordinary laptop plus a HackRF box into a portable device that
could *detect* the presence of stingrays, i.e. an "IMS-Catcher Catcher".
For me at least it would be really a lot of fun to have one of those,
i.e. an IMS-Catcher Catcher (stingray detector).
I am not far from the State Capitol in California, and I, for one, would
love nothing better than to wardrive down around the Capitol (and
associated state government buildings), checking to see if there are
any active stingrays operating in the area.  (In the Oslo incidents,
it was reported that several of the stringrays seemed to be strategically
placed near major government building, including the Prime Minister's
residence.)  Of course, if I found any, I would immediately try to share
that info with the few journos I know... and everybody else who I could
get to pay attention.
So, anyway, finally, my quuestion:
Do any of you folks here know if anybody has created any publically
available software (copyleft or otherwise) that would allow, e.g. a
HackRF or any other inexpensive SDR to be turned into a stingray
detector?  If so, I'd love to receive a link to that.
I have a laptop and $330 USB burning a hole in my pocket.
P.S.  I did do some googling for what I'm asking for (before posting here)
but the closest thing I found way an academic paper from Q3 2014 that
seemed to say that the software these guys developed wasn't even up to
what could be called "Beta quality":
They made their code freely available, but it appears that it has been
stagnant and languishing since they did their paper in Q3 2014. :-(
P.P.S.  In an ideal world, I'd like to see great massive hoards of people
running around city centers all over the world... wardriving for a new
generation...  triangulating the exact locations of any stingrays they
find, and then making all that info public someplace, e.g. on some single
web site.
I mean nobody knows where these things are *or* who might be operating
them!  (Anybody can buy one now for only $1800 USD off of alibaba.com...
or probably build one themselves for much less with a laptop and a HackRF.)
P.P.P.S.  It really is too bad that the journalists who broke the Oslo
stingrays story didn't do the sensible thing and follow-up properly on
their initial finding, i.e. by *triangulating* until they had the exact
locations of the various stingrays they found.  If they had done that,
then it might have been a LOT harder for the Powers That Be to just
dismiss and deny their published findings, as they did, thus effectively
sweeping the whole thing under the rug as far as the public was concerned.

If that's the old "OMG, too much" argument... load re anon overlay nets
may be more like bitcoin's interrelated variables... difficulty, txfees, reward,
watts, price, txrate, etc... they'll slide nicely around to compensate until
some unsolveable fundamental limit is reached. ie:
Private (non-exit/I2P) use of these nets... if they slow, users will start
talking urging more nodes, which they'll readily deploy themselves since
private is low risk and satiates their use case. If the required node count
to support n-million users starts blowing up CPU/RAM, devs will
start getting poked to work on layering that. Even parallel nets
with usage charters may arise by then as a given networks adversary
resistance begets users begets trust begets honoring narrower charter.
Besides, load happens to useful nets, no point trying to stave it off
(nets are anon so staving is a no anyway), and trying to stave makes
the stavers look stupid.
A little education helps too, users will self regulate if they sense that,
"Oh shit, I know this net is used for , but I can't
even get my own  through, so I better ease up on variable ".
Is it chaff, and good as to filling otherwise quiet parts of the net?
Perhaps. But as in other GPA threads, I think fill traffic may need
to be actively managed to defeat that, rather than just flooded.

U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell set up a vote late on
Monday to expand the FBI's authority to use a secretive surveillance
order without a warrant to include email metadata and some browsing
history information. The move, made via an amendment to a criminal
justice appropriations bill, is an effort by Senate Republicans to
respond to last week's mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub after a
series of measures to restrict guns offered by both parties failed on
Monday. Privacy advocates denounced the effort, saying it seeks to
exploit a mass shooting in order to expand the government's digital
spying powers. The amendment would broaden the FBI's authority to use
so-called National Security Letters to include electronic
communications transaction records such as time stamps of emails and
the emails' senders and recipients. NSLs do not require a warrant and
are almost always accompanied by a gag order preventing the service
provider from sharing the request with a targeted user. The amendment
filed Monday would also make permanent a provision of the USA Patriot
Act that allows the intelligence community to conduct surveillance on
"lone wolf" suspects who do not have confirmed ties to a foreign
terrorist group. A vote is expected no later than Wednesday,
McConnell's office said. Last week, FBI Director James Comey said he
is "highly confident that [the Orlando shooter] was radicalized at

You may want to review two recent threads regarding

(Some portion of these threads are on tor-talk, tor-dev, cypherpunks,

They may span multiple months so you'll have to dig those out.
And note that torproject's archives destroy useful things like
cc, attachments, crypto sigs. Cypherpunks is intact.)
design side...
Some [officials] within torproject will decry traffic, and have even
gone so far as to suggest they'll deploy coded countermeasures
(which since the traffic is anonymous, and the code is opensource,
doesn't work and kills someone else's good as well). In the end,
just like video on clearnet, users and their traffic will come, and
utilize whatever capacity and features they can, nothing you can
do about it.
A more qualified thought... I find ongoing intentional exclusive
use of exits so people can basically get their trivial entertainment
LOL's using filesharing apps such as bittorrent (or any other use that
is known to tax networks)... to be rather immature to unethical.
However I do see fine use in performing initial import of clearnet
datasets via exits (if maintaining anonymity of such import action is
necessary), provided they then cut their clients over to run exclusively
within the anonymous networks. (In the case of bittorrent, that
means disconnecting the split horizon network path to clearnet,
swapping out clearnet trackers for trackers within the anonymous
overlay networks, using PEX / DHT within those nets, and possibly
managing running two instances over various datasets.) ie:
Someone might import the latest opensource unix iso's via clearnet
without use of exits, then cut and seed exclusively via anon overlay nets.
Same person might need to import the latest political leaks and
civil rights videos via exits, then cut and seed similarly.
I agree that linking the various overlays, features, services, and users
together is generally a good thing. I tend to argue IPv6 for that since
so many of todays apps and users speak that. However there's certainly
other shims, proxies, and addressing stacks people can dream and
code up, particularly for asynchronous / non-real-time messaging and
file like storage services.
Users also need to research and think clearly about any security
and privacy impact using such links may have on them.

When I ran, donated, managed relays... only wanted all of what
I paid for to be consumed. "Wished" it would be in alignment
with certain ideals, but realized that's not reality.
For more and different opinions from relays, you might want to
post to tor-relays@ referencing the archive url to this thread.
Yeah, it's freenet over tor. Makes for an interesting definition
of hidden service. Don't forget to add around 1000+ ms latency.
Anonymous uncensorable overlay networks, are "used" by
whoever, for whatever, limited only by the techinical and practical
capabilities of each network. There are many "gigs of media files"
being shared over freenet and other nets by many happy and even
wasteful users. This fact understandably burns the britches of
those who intend their network to be used only for some other
purposes. It happens.
There seems to be ongoing and growing interest around the
world in overlay nets and parallel wire[less] 'guerilla' nets,
and lots of room for improved and new code and models.
No worries here.
some relays to match
This has always been my position. Each user of these "free"
community powered networks has an impact. For some nets
this has readily calculable minimums, like tor and its 6x minimum
for exclusively non-exit (HS) use. Other nets or usage models
may be roughly estimated. Therefore each user of such networks
should know / learn the impact for their respective network.
And should realize that they are in a way obligated to return
the resources they consume, as otherwise their network will
not have headroom and their own experience will go downhill fast.
Note that the correct form for engineering, and apps interfacing
at the level of, network traffic rates... is bits (b), not bytes (B),
and decimal prefixes, not binary prefixes.

The EFF reports that a federal court in Virginia today ruled that a
criminal defendant has no "reasonable expectation of privacy" in his
personal computer (PDF), located inside his home. The court says the
federal government does not need a warrant to hack into an
individual's computer. EFF reports: "The implications for the
decision, if upheld, are staggering: law enforcement would be free to
remotely search and seize information from your computer, without a
warrant, without probable cause, or without any suspicion at all. To
say the least, the decision is bad news for privacy. But it's also
incorrect as a matter of law, and we expect there is little chance it
would hold up on appeal. (It also was not the central component of the
judge's decision, which also diminishes the likelihood that it will
become reliable precedent.) But the decision underscores a broader
trend in these cases: courts across the country, faced with unfamiliar
technology and unsympathetic defendants, are issuing decisions that
threaten everyone's rights.

This use case is nice to hear. Compared to other networks and
attack vectors it's not the best at, Tor has put good effort into
and is rather strong at getting around DPI type censorship.
Other nets can probably learn something from tor re this.
Yes any unix packet filter can count this by IPv6 netblock.

A bill that was proposed recently in the Russian Duma to make
cryptographic backdoors mandatory in all messaging apps, has passed.
Patrick Howell O'Neill, reports for DailyDot:A massive surveillance
bill is now on its way to becoming law in Russia. The "anti-terrorism"
legislation includes a vast data-eavesdropping and -retention program
so that telecom and internet companies have to record and store all
customer communications for six months, potentially at a
multitrillion-dollar cost. Additionally, all internet firms have to
provide mandatory backdoor access into encrypted communications for
the FSB, the Russian intelligence agency and successor to the KGB. The
bill, with support from the ruling United Russia party, passed Friday
in the Duma, Russia's lower legislative house, with 277 votes for, 148
against, and one abstaining. It now moves to Russia's Federal Council
and the Kremlin, where it's expected to pass into law.

The whole case was blackmail. They were just waiting for the defendant
to get tired of fighting and give up. Itâs not the one whoâs in the
right who wins, but the one who has the most staying power.
They never send you straight to where youâre going. You drive through
a number of other prisons first. If you make trouble, say by
complaining to the judge that your rights are being violated, youâre
put through this thing called "diesel therapy." They bounce you back
and forth between prisons like a ping-pong ball.
I was taken from Alexandria to Brooklyn, from there to Pennsylvania,
from there back to Brooklyn, and from there to Pennsylvania againâa
total of about 16 hours of driving. Before I got to where I was meant
to be going, I was put in two different prisons, one of which was a
supermax prison where they keep the worst of the worst. I was there
for 10 days. There are more than 2.5 million prisoners in the United
States. Almost one percent of the whole population is in prison, and
thatâs a huge problem. But what surprised me most was that there are
private prisons in the US. The more prisoners, the more money you get
from the state. Itâs big business.
Estonia was the only country that didnât give its people any support.
All the other countries gave their prisoners at least some pocket
money. Even 10-20 euros wouldâve been a great help, because you donât
even get normal soap for free there, not to mention shampoo. Youâre
given toothpaste whose "best before" was in 2005 and two 20 x 40 cm
towels for your whole body for half a year.

@_subject: Tor funding 
Tor actually does have an individual donation component.
Though it doesn't yet go into statistics about number and
size distribution of transactions for each funding method,
there's at least some level of breakout in the annual report
and filings.
Tor has an element of "can't teach old dog new tricks", or
at least "we're moving, slowly..." the Tor dog has received
a lot of "compromised" (from some minds or global perspectives)
money. Some principals in tor grew up in certain spheres of work,
for which say, writing proposals for, and getting, government grants,
is what they're good at. Contracts bids are of course more one
sided than bilateral interest work or grant requests. Public sector
work / careers (Government, University) are just naturally that way.
Others are good at courting large private foundations / NGOs,
some of those not everyone would agree on either, and some
possibly funded in turn by similar objectionables.
Maybe some of this needs to be thrown out to some sort of
community approval model. Maybe a growing percentage moratorium
on objectionables, and such a stand up announcement, is part of that.
Some even say remove all the program outreach money to a
separate entity. With other folks just coding for BTC.
Balancing and transitioning is hard.
Maybe tor just got "lucky" here, who knows.
One thing that should be thought about is any undue mass effect,
and how to help other projects in the space [1] that are small or
lack the above historically conjoined funding talent and sources,
yet whose code, ideas, and papers are seen as important / competing
work, or have been used by larger projects.
Monopolies in any field are usually not a good thing, so you want
to be quite careful about creating or sustaining them.
And continually reevaluate, as a process, if what you're funding
and coding is still worthy of your efforts.

Again, to what threat model?
I've only mention GPA, fix for which may involve, at possible minimum,
all nodes encrypting full fill traffic reclocked with jitter, under
some form of negotiated and enforced possibly dynamic traffic
contracts with peers.
I may also be on crack.
That's an active attack, not a GPA trolling through packets.
Then your peers may de-peer you until things look normal.
Or it may take a while for you to get signal through.
And if they're already close enough to disrupt you
specifically, you've probably got other problems.
Not when every node is doing reclocking and de-peering
peers that seem to be misbehaving or dishonoring contracts.
Again, that's active, and application level, not GPA.
You mean like rooting a bunch of Linux nodes, 6+:1 ratio ...

 696 Windows
 291 FreeBSD

   4 Bitrig
   3 SunOS

   1 CYGWIN_NT-10.0-WOW
Or compromising the repo or developers or 3rd party libraries...
Or asking your friends AT&T et al to help...
What's the threat?
Again, talk about whatever, but people need to specify the
threat model if they're going to really discuss solutions.
Nor is Tor the only active network currently subject to attack.
Do they and their court docs officially say that?
Or just some blogger reading 4chan?

Then the full solution is to unplug, smash, and go outside and play...
... just be sure to wear your helmet :)
If the thread is a thread just griping on threats that's fine.
But lumping them all in versus fill traffic (being a possible solution
to the one specific subthreat of GPA)... probably isn't productive
towards solving anything... whether the entire threat
or any particular subthreat. Especially when fill traffic hasn't
yet been speculated here to enhance the efficacy of any other
existing threat, or to create new threats.
That's not a quote from an original source. Neither is what it references...

"The Ground Truth About Encryption, and The Consequences of
Extraordinary Access"
Abstract: U.S. policy makers are currently engaged in a debate
regarding the merits of
mandating a means of “extraordinary access” to encrypted data for U.S.
law enforcement, what
is sometimes referred to as an encryption “backdoor.”  This paper
examines modern encryption
technologies, the feasibility of providing law enforcement with
extraordinary access, the impact
that encryption technology is currently having on U.S. law enforcement
(which some have referred
to as “going dark”), and the likely impacts that an extraordinary
access requirement would have
on U.S. national security, the technology sector, and continued
innovation in the security field.
We conclude that an extraordinary access requirement is likely to have
a negative impact on
technological development, the United States’ international standing,
and the competitiveness
of the U.S. economy and will have adverse long-term effects on the
security, privacy, and civil
liberties of citizens.

Flag days are completely rational in bitcoin network
exactly the same and entirely rational as the banking
network has roughly 8-16 hours in a night to flag change
their junk. Especially since bitcoin and any other digital
currency offers a new paradigm of expectation to follow.
Software updates is one of those things to expects.
Bricking through change is a great defensive idea if needed,
however unfortunately it applies to all miners, clients,
etc that currently exist following the protocol.
Therefore the only way to break self interested cartels
is for the end user community to get together, realize
there is a real problem, and act to solve it. Seemingly
in this case, to openly design sell distribute open
high performance mining hardware under legally enforced
open sales records contract models at scale exclusively
to distributed end users at cost.
Communities of digital currencies will wake up to this
when they see their assets / dreams being pushed to
zero by such cartel influences. After all, that action
is the supposed model of these decentral digital currencies.
Right about now would be a good time to wake up.

Nobody's going to want to pay BTC over 3% CC fee in retail.
Dark money can tolerate more fees, but how much?
We still see in and out at up to 10% local and washing at 2*3%,
plus the 4+*3% real world retail tolerance txfee limit, is 38+%
the dark max before they too bail out?
So eventually, real soon now...
- Every bitcoin user must realize they have to volunteer,
develop, sell at cost, and put a $25 open mining chip
in their system. This kills mining profit cartels and gives top
end network tx capacity (nodecount) beyond visa+mc+banks...
after tuning network protocols. (Hypothesis of mining
requiring / enabled by profit, instead of just to keep the
net up so your unspent value can play, was likely design flaw...
lots of networks operate fine on volunteerism without pay.)
- Tx scaling must be solved into that new distributed capacity.
- Blockchain disk storage must be distributed
into distributed protocol archives, possibly with aging
by requiring unspents be spent past archive checkpoints.
More protocol work for this.
In all this, nobody can have their keys invalidated, diminished
in value, or be required to push their unspent through a realworld
exchange into some other value (black and private market cap,
whether entity or personal, are now huge and will refuse to play that).
Nor is it known if and for how many hours flag days could be done.
All seems sortof deadlocked right now...

Open and secure does not preclude any of these things.
What is your potential when you're chained to a wall?
With open, possibility is a right of others, with closed,
you forclose it upon them, and likely to serve yourself.
That may be part of the potential.
iOS/Android haven't even hit 10 years old and neither
they nor their underlying platforms truly have openness in
their core ethos so they can't really be contrasted against
each other in the suggested way.
The general reply is that the overall model of open and all
these related things simply hasn't had enough time to develop,
execute, and be evaluated in a world that has only known closed.
However one thing is of absolute certainty: believing that getting

References:  <56DE8F93.4050307
This goes to two things...
- the usage models you expect
- the usage models you want to enable
Let's keep in mind that the fundamental strengths
of onioncat and reason that it exists are...
- tor and other anonymous overlay networks often do not
support full IP semantics, with tor it's TCP only, which
cripples or eliminates certain apps.
- anonymous overlay networks often do not support
interfaces to the traditional IP stack of OS's, with
tor it's onion only, which you can't bind(2) to, except
via hack within the tor daemon... which only does tcp,
which doesn't route, or packet filter, or VM, or...
"NO" ... well, that's fine for individual people who
meetup elsewhere and personally agree to exchange
keys and addresses (or find such listed on the web, etc)
in order to communicate. It scales only to the extent
one can personally manage it, and it is not oppurtunistic
as far as making random new introductions.
"YES"... this is where the real potential lies. Lots
of apps are p2p, or at least rely on central servers
to tell them of their peers in real time. Bitcoin and
bittorrent are purely p2p with peers coming in via
the network itself at random. VOIP could be thought
to be central yet random. This list of non-manual config
apps is really long. Then evaluate which are popular
in the opensource space whereby they're possibly
not run by popular centrals like facebook, but by
community (XMPP), or strictly p2p.
It seems that NO would still serve a purpose and thus
would be a call to making an onioncat v2. And that YES
would be a very interesting project that needs to look at
many potential solutions some of which people post ideas
about on list.
Yes if it is available, or willing to be developed and integrated
by the overlays for such use.
For example, it may be possible that the [transmission] bittorrent,
and cryptocoin, communities might see a reason to run something
separate if it gave them p2p access to anonymous transport layers.
Public usage is all in supply, demand, and advertising.
Private usage has seen some successful onion/i2p like
what.cd [nee i2p/onion] membership.
Evaluating the needs of some VOIP and messaging
protocols re IPv6 UDP and tun interface might be useful.
We already know bittorrent needs udp and trackerless p2p
to be efficient.
Another way to think is... can the overall utility of anonymous
overlay networks ever grow if they continue to be restricted to,
say, TCP and their own proprietary addressing stacks?
Are there RFC type proposals to interoperate / expand that among
the community of overlay networks?
And is onioncat a good place to enable that if either are no?

  NEW YORK -- The US government has made numerous attempts to obtain
  source code from tech companies in an effort to find security flaws
  that could be used for surveillance or investigations.
  The government has demanded source code in civil cases filed under
  seal but also by seeking clandestine rulings authorized under the
  secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), a person with
  direct knowledge of these demands told ZDNet. We're not naming the
  person as they relayed information that is likely classified.
  With these hearings held in secret and away from the public gaze, the

@_subject: Apple GovtOS/FBiOS & Proof of Work 
References: ---------- Forwarded message ----------
If Apple is willing to put some serious Proof of Work into
constructing *every* firmware update, then it could achieve some level
of privacy:
When constructing a firmware update, the SHA512 (or better still, some
Apple proprietary) hash of the update has to have some preset number
of '0' bits.  So Apple will have to brute force fiddle with bits in
the firmware load to achieve an appropriate hash.  The work involved
should grow exponentially in the # of '0' bits required.
Most companies operate on a fixed update schedule, so Apple would have
to plan every release far enough in advance to give Apple enough time
to compute such a firmware load.  The reason for an Apple proprietary
hash is so any attacker would have to build their own custom chips to
be able to beat Apple at this Proof of Work game.  Note also, that
Apple can *change* the hash function on every firmware update, so said
custom chip would be useful for only one firmware release.
The firmware loader of course refuses to load any firmware whose hash
doesn't have the appropriate number of '0' bits (along with the
standard Apple signing key checks, etc.).  The hash also incorporates
the previous firmware load a la Merkle, so if your firmware is ever
compromised, your iPhone is forever bricked.
The hardware loading code refuses to load the first block of the new
firmware anywhere but right on top of the user's file encryption key.
So the *default* for the firmware flasher is to always *forget* this
key, unless very special arrangements are made to save this key in
other places.  This key is further encrypted and broken into many
pieces prior to moving it out of the way of the firmware loader
(including into the CPU's volatile register memory, so any power
disruption will destroy some of this key).
Of course, much like a password hashing function, such Apple hash
functions would be designed specifically to be *slow*, so GPU's and
gate-arrays would be of no particular value.
With a proper PoW system, any attacker would have to spend at least as
much time as Apple themselves to create a loadable firmware, and that
time might be as long as 6-12 months.
A scalable way for Apple to dominate any attacker (including most
nation-states) is to utilize the *entire installed base* of Apple
products (estimated by Tim Cook to be >1 billion devices) in a
distributed calculation.  Thus, Apple could use its "herd" itself to
provide for "herd immunity" to firmware update attacks.  iPhone users
would notice if Apple were attempting to compute >1 firmware update
PoW at any given time!
A 6-12 month lead time (during which the PoW for GovtOS is being
computed) would give Apple plenty of time to respond to any legal
issues and warn other Apple customers of an impending breach-of-trust
in the firmware update chain.
If Apple is issued an NSL and can't talk about it, 6-12 months would
still be a long enough delay to deter all but the most persistent of
govts.  Even Napoleon refused to look at any messages until they were
at least 3 days old; he found out that 99% of these messages resolved
themselves without any action on his part -- e.g., "please pardon my
son; he is to be executed in the morning".
If Apple speeded up or slowed down its pre-announced firmware update
schedule, that change itself would provide an excellent "warrant

that Whatsapp would never encrypt anything end-to-end.

Remember SecureBoot...
You can find many motherboards with SecureBoot
that have the Microsoft PK's locked in the BIOS. Best
you can do is 'disable' it and not be 'secure' anymore.
The Linux crowd went apeshit over it, and rightfully so. Then they
dropped to their knees and wrote silly stub loaders and submitted
them to their Microsoft Overlord for signing. They are still submitting
to this scheme today, even though they don't have to...
Because if you look, you can find boards that allow completely
deleting the Microsoft keys and installing and managing your
own in the BIOS, and opensource tools to sign and authorize
your own loaders do exist. Buy those boards instead.
Tech can be useful, but you better fight for, select, and
maintain your private right and control over it.

Each weekday, dozens of U.S. government aircraft take to the skies and

the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the planes are fitted with
high-resolution video cameras, often working with "augmented reality"
software that can superimpose onto the video images everything from
street and business names to the owners of individual homes. At least
a few planes have carried devices that can track the cell phones of
people below. Most of the aircraft are small, flying a mile or so
above ground, and many use exhaust mufflers to mute their engines --
making them hard to detect by the people they're spying on. [...] The

How Technology Hijacks People’s Minds — from a Magician and
      Google’s Design Ethicist
By Tristan Harris (*) - May 2016-
I’m an expert on how technology hijacks our psychological
vulnerabilities. That’s why I spent the last three years as Google’s
Design Ethicist caring about how to design things in a way that defends
a billion people’s minds from getting hijacked.
When using technology, we often focus /optimistically/ on all the things
it does for us. But I want you to show you where it might do the opposite.
*/Where does technology exploit our minds’ weaknesses/**?*
I learned to think this way when I was a magician. Magicians start by
looking for /blind spots, edges, vulnerabilities and/ /limits/ of
people’s perception, so they can influence what people do without them
even realizing it. Once you know how to push people’s buttons, you can
play them like a piano.
That’s me performing sleight of hand magic at my mother’s birthday party
And this is exactly what product designers do to your mind. They play
your psychological vulnerabilities (consciously and unconsciously)
against you in the race to grab your attention.
I want to show you how they do it.
        Hijack  If You Control the Menu, You Control the Choices
Western Culture is built around ideals of individual choice and freedom.
Millions of us fiercely defend our right to make “free” choices, while
we ignore how we’re manipulated upstream by limited menus we didn’t choose.
This is exactly what magicians do. They give people the illusion of free
choice while architecting the menu so that they win, no matter what you
choose. I can’t emphasize how deep this insight is.
When people are given a menu of choices, they rarely ask:
  * “what’s not on the menu?”
  * “why am I being given /these options/ and not others?”
  * “do I know the menu provider’s goals?”
  * “is this menu /empowering/ for my original need, or are the choices
    actually a distraction?” (e.g. an overwhelmingly array of toothpastes)
How /empowering is this menu/ of choices for the need, “I ran out of
For example, imagine you’re out with friends on a Tuesday night and want
to keep the conversation going. You open Yelp to find nearby
recommendations and see a list of bars. The group turns into a huddle of
faces staring down at their phones /comparing bars. /They scrutinize the
photos of each, comparing cocktail drinks. Is this menu still relevant
to the original desire of the group?
It’s not that bars aren’t a good choice, it’s that Yelp substituted the
group’s original question (“where can we go to keep talking?”) with a
different question (“what’s a bar with good photos of cocktails?”) all
by shaping the menu.
Moreover, the group falls for the illusion that Yelp’s menu represents a
phones, they don’t see the park across the street with a band playing
live music. They miss the pop-up gallery on the other side of the street
serving crepes and coffee. Neither of those show up on Yelp’s menu.
Yelp subtly reframes the group’s need “where can we go to keep talking?”
in terms of photos of cocktails served.
The more choices technology gives us in nearly every domain of our lives
(information, events, places to go, friends, dating, jobs) — /the more
we assume that our phone is always the most empowering and useful menu
to pick from/. Is it?
*/The “most empowering” menu is different than the menu that has the
most choices/*/. /But when we blindly surrender to the menus we’re
given, it’s easy to lose track of the difference:
  * “Who’s free tonight to hang out?” becomes a menu of /most recent
    people who texted us /(who we could ping).
  * “What’s happening in the world?” becomes a menu of news feed stories.
  * “Who’s single to go on a date?” becomes a menu//of faces to swipe on
    Tinder (instead of local events with friends, or urban adventures
    nearby).
  * “I have to respond to this email.” becomes a menu of /keys to type a
    response/ (instead of empowering ways to communicate with a person).
All user interfaces are menus. What if your email client gave you
want to type back?” (Design by Tristan Harris)/
When we wake up in the morning and turn our phone over to see a list of
notifications — it frames the experience of “waking up in the morning”
around a menu of “all the things I’ve missed since yesterday.”
A list of notifications when we wake up in the morning — how /empowering
is this menu of choices when we wake up? Does it reflect what we care
about? (credit to Joe Edelman)/
By shaping the menus we pick from, technology hijacks the way we
perceive our choices and replaces them new ones. But the closer we pay
attention to the options we’re given, the more we’ll notice when they
don’t actually align with our true needs.
        *Hijack  Put a Slot Machine In a Billion Pockets*
If you’re an app, how do you keep people hooked? Turn yourself into a
slot machine.
The average person checks their phone 150 times a day. Why do we do
this? Are we making /150/ /conscious/ /choices/?
How often do you check your email per day?
One major reason why is the  psychological ingredient in slot
machines: *intermittent variable rewards*
If you want to maximize addictiveness, all tech designers need to do is
link a user’s action (like pulling a lever) with a /variable reward/.
You pull a lever and immediately receive either an enticing reward (a
match, a prize!) or nothing. Addictiveness is maximized when the rate of
reward is most variable.
Does this effect really work on people? Yes. *Slot machines make more
money in the United States than baseball, movies, and theme parks
Relative to other kinds of gambling, people get ‘problematically
involved’ with slot machines *3–4x faster*
to NYU professor Natasha Dow Shull, author of /Addiction by Design./
*But here’s the unfortunate truth — several billion people have a slot
machine their pocket:*
  * When we pull our phone out of our pocket, we’re /playing a slot
    machine/ to see what notifications we got.
  * When we pull to refresh our email, we’re /playing a slot machine /to
    see what new email we got.
  * When we swipe down our finger to scroll the Instagram feed, we’re
    /playing a slot machine/ to see what photo comes next.
  * When we swipe faces left/right on dating apps like Tinder, we’re
    /playing a slot machine/ to see if we got a match.
  * When we tap the # of red notifications, we’re /playing a slot
    machine /to what’s underneath.
Apps and websites sprinkle intermittent variable rewards all over their
products because it’s good for business.
But in other cases, slot machines emerge by accident. For example, there
is no malicious corporation behind /all of email/ who consciously chose
to make it a slot machine. No one profits when millions check their
email and nothing’s there. Neither did Apple and Google’s designers
But now companies like Apple and Google have a responsibility to reduce
these effects by /converting intermittent variable rewards into less
addictive, more predictable ones/ with better design. For example, they
could empower people to set predictable times during the day or week for
when they want to check “slot machine” apps, and correspondingly adjust
when new messages are delivered to align with those times.
        Hijack  Fear of Missing Something Important (FOMSI)
Another way apps and websites hijack people’s minds is by inducing a “1%
chance you could be missing something important.”
If I convince you that I’m a channel for important information,
messages, friendships, or potential sexual opportunities — it will be
hard for you to turn me off, unsubscribe, or remove your account —
because (aha, I win) you might miss something important:
  * This keeps us subscribed to newsletters even after they haven’t
    delivered recent benefits (“what if I miss a future announcement?”)
  * This keeps us “friended” to people with whom we haven’t spoke in
    ages (“what if I miss something important from them?”)
  * This keeps us swiping faces on dating apps, even when we haven’t
    even met up with anyone in a while (“what if I miss that /one hot
    match/ who likes me?”)
  * This keeps us using social media (“what if I miss that important
    news story or fall behind what my friends are talking about?”)
But if we zoom into that fear, we’ll discover that it’s unbounded/:
we’ll always miss something important /at any point when we stop using
  * There are magic moments on Facebook we’ll miss by not using it for
    the 6th hour (e.g. an old friend who’s visiting town /right now/).
  * There are magic moments we’ll miss on Tinder (e.g. our dream
    romantic partner) by not swiping our 700th match.
  * There are emergency phone calls we’ll miss if we’re not connected
    24/7/./
how we’re built to live./
And it’s amazing how quickly, once we let go of that fear, we wake up
from the illusion. When we unplug for more than a day, unsubscribe from
those notifications, or go to Camp Grounded  —
the concerns we thought we’d have don’t actually happen.
The thought, “what if I miss something important?” is generated /in
advance of unplugging, unsubscribing, or turning off /—  not after.
Imagine if tech companies recognized that, and helped us proactively
tune our relationships with friends and businesses in terms of what we
define as “time well spent ” for our lives,
instead of in terms of what we might miss.
        Hijack  Social Approval
Easily one of the most persuasive things a human being can receive.
We’re all vulnerable to *social approval*. The need to belong, to be
approved or appreciated by our peers is among the highest human
motivations. But now our social approval is in the hands of tech companies.
When I get tagged by my friend Marc, I imagine him making a /conscious
choice /to tag me. But I don’t see how a company like Facebook
orchestrated his doing that in the first place.
Facebook, Instagram or SnapChat can manipulate how often people get
tagged in photos by automatically suggesting all the faces people should
tag (e.g. by showing a box with a 1-click confirmation, “Tag Tristan in
this photo?”).
So when Marc tags me, /he’s actually/ /responding to Facebook’s
suggestion,/ not making an independent choice. But through design
choices like this, /Facebook controls the multiplier for/ /how often
millions of people experience their social approval on the line/.
Facebook uses automatic suggestions like this to get people to tag more
people, creating more social externalities and interruptions.
The same happens when we change our main profile photo — Facebook knows
that’s a moment when we’re /vulnerable to social approval/: /“what do my
friends think of my new pic?” /Facebook can rank this higher in the news
feed, so it sticks around for longer and more friends will like or
comment on it. Each time they like or comment on it, we’ll get pulled
right back.
Everyone innately responds to social approval, but some demographics
(teenagers) are more vulnerable to it than others. That’s why it’s so
important to recognize how powerful designers are when they exploit this
        Hijack  Social Reciprocity (Tit-for-tat)
  * You do me a favor, now I owe you one next time.
  * You say, “thank you”— I have to say “you’re welcome.”
  * You send me an email— it’s rude not to get back to you.
  * You follow me — it’s rude not to follow you back. (especially for
    teenagers)
We are /vulnerable/ /to needing to reciprocate others’ gestures/. But as
with Social Approval, tech companies now manipulate how often we
experience it.
In some cases, it’s by accident./Email, texting and messaging apps are
social reciprocity factories/. But in other cases, companies exploit
this vulnerability on purpose.
LinkedIn is the most obvious offender. LinkedIn wants as many people
creating social obligations for each other as possible, because each
time they reciprocate (by accepting a connection, responding to a
message, or endorsing someone back for a skill) they have to come back
to linkedin.com where they can get people to spend more time.
Like Facebook, LinkedIn exploits an asymmetry in perception. When you
receive an invitation from someone to connect, you imagine that person
making a /conscious choice/ to invite you, when in reality, they likely
unconsciously responded to LinkedIn’s list of suggested contacts. In
other words, LinkedIn turns your/unconscious impulses/ (to “add” a
person) into new social obligations that millions of people feel
obligated to repay. All while they profit from the time people spend
doing it.
Imagine millions of people getting interrupted like this throughout
their day, running around like chickens with their heads cut off,
reciprocating each other — all designed by companies who profit from it.
Welcome to social media.
After accepting an endorsement, LinkedIn takes advantage of your bias to
reciprocate by offering *four* additional people for you to endorse in
Imagine if technology companies had a responsibility to minimize social
reciprocity. Or if there was an “FDA for Tech” that monitored when
technology companies abused these biases?
        *Hijack  Bottomless bowls, Infinite Feeds, and Autoplay*
YouTube autoplays the next video after a countdown
Another way to hijack people is to keep them consuming things, even when
they aren’t hungry anymore.
How? Easy. /Take an experience that was bounded and finite, and turn it
into a bottomless flow/ /that keeps going/.
Cornell professor Brian Wansink demonstrated this in his study showing
you can trick people into keep eating soup by giving them a bottomless
bowl that automatically refills as they eat. With bottomless bowls, people
eat 73% more calories than those with normal bowls and underestimate how
many calories they ate by 140 calories.
Tech companies exploit the same principle. News feeds are purposely
designed to auto-refill with reasons to keep you scrolling, and
purposely eliminate any reason for you to pause, reconsider or leave.
It’s also why video and social media sites like Netflix, YouTube or
Facebook /autoplay/ the next video after a countdown instead of waiting
for you to make a conscious choice (in case you won’t). A huge portion
of traffic on these websites is driven by autoplaying the next thing.
Facebook autoplays the next video after a countdown
Tech companies often claim that “we’re just making it easier for users
to see the video /they want/ to watch” when they are actually serving
their business interests. And you can’t blame them, because increasing
“time spent” is the currency they compete for.
Instead, imagine if technology companies empowered you to /consciously
bound your experience /to align with what would be “time well spent
” for you. Not just bounding the /quantity /of
time you spend, but the /qualities/ of what would be “time well spent.”
        Hijack  Instant Interruption vs. “Respectful” Delivery
Companies know that messages /that interrupt people immediately are more
persuasive at getting people to respond /than messages delivered
asynchronously (like email or any deferred inbox).
Given the choice, Facebook Messenger (or WhatsApp, WeChat or SnapChat
for that matter) would /prefer to design their messaging system to/
helping users respect each other’s attention.
In other words, *interruption is good for business*.
It’s also in their interest to heighten the feeling of urgency and
social reciprocity. For example, Facebook automatically /tells the
sender when you “saw” their message, instead of letting you avoid
disclosing whether you read it/ (“now that you know I’ve seen the
message, I feel even more obligated to respond.”)
By contrast, Apple more respectfully lets users toggle “Read Receipts”
on or off.
The problem is, maximizing interruptions in the name of business creates
a tragedy of the commons, ruining global attention spans and causing
billions of unnecessary interruptions each day. This is a huge problem
we need to fix with shared design standards (potentially, as part of
Time Well Spent ).
        Hijack  Bundling Your Reasons with Their Reasons
Another way apps hijack you is by taking /your reasons/ for visiting the
app (to perform a task) and /make them inseparable from the app’s
business reasons/ (maximizing how much we consume once we’re there).
For example, in the physical world of grocery stories, the  and most popular reasons to visit are pharmacy refills and buying milk. But
grocery stores want to maximize how much people buy, so they put the
pharmacy and the milk at the back of the store.
inseparable from what the business wants./ If stores were /truly
organized to support people/, they would put the most popular items in
the front .
Tech companies design their websites the same way. For example, when you
you want to look up a Facebook event happening tonight (your reason) the
Facebook app doesn’t allow you to access it without first landing on the
news feed (their reasons), and that’s on purpose. /Facebook wants to
convert every reason you have for using Facebook, into their reason
which is to maximize the time you spend consuming things/.
In an ideal world, apps would always give you a /direct way/ to get what
you want /separately/ from what they want.
Imagine a digital “bill of rights” outlining design standards that
forced the products used by billions of people to support empowering
ways for them to navigate toward their goals.
        *Hijack  Inconvenient Choices*
We’re told that it’s enough for businesses to “make choices available.”
  * “If you don’t like it you can always use a different product.”
  * “If you don’t like it, you can always unsubscribe.”
  * “If you’re addicted to our app, you can always uninstall it from
    your phone.”
Businesses naturally /want to make the choices they want you to make
easier, and the choices they don’t want you to make harder./ Magicians
do the same thing. You make it easier for a spectator to pick the thing
you want them to pick, and harder to pick the thing you don’t.
For example, NYTimes.com lets you “make a free choice” to cancel your
digital subscription. But instead of just doing it when you hit “Cancel
Subscription,” they /send you an email with information on how to cancel

Instead of viewing the world in terms of /availability of choices/, we
should view the world in terms of /friction required to enact choices/.
Imagine a world where choices were labeled with how difficult they were
to fulfill (like coefficients of friction) and there was an FDA for Tech
that labeled these difficulties and set standards for how easy
navigation should be.
        Hijack  Forecasting Errors, “Foot in the Door” strategies
Facebook promises an easy choice to “See Photo.” Would we still click if
it gave the true price tag?
Lastly, apps can exploit people’s inability to forecast consequences of
a click.
People don’t intuitively forecast the /true cost/ /of a click /when it’s
presented to them. Sales people use “foot in the door” techniques by
asking for a small innocuous request to begin with (“just one click to
see which tweet got retweeted”) and escalate from there (“why don’t you
stay awhile?”). Virtually all engagement websites use this trick.
Imagine if web browsers and smartphones, the gateways through which
people make these choices, were truly watching out for people and helped
them forecast the consequences of clicks (based on real data about what
it actually costs most people?).
That’s why I add “Estimated reading time” to the top of my posts. When
you put the “true cost” of a choice in front of people, you’re treating
your users or audience with dignity and respect. In a Time Well Spent
 internet, choices could be framed in terms of
projected cost and benefit, so people were empowered to make informed
choices by default, not by doing extra work.
TripAdvisor uses a “foot in the door” technique by asking for a single
click review (“How many stars?”) while hiding the three page survey of
questions behind the click.
        Summary And How We Can Fix This
Are you upset that technology hijacks your agency? I am too. I’ve listed
a few techniques but there are literally thousands. Imagine whole
bookshelves, seminars, workshops and trainings that teach aspiring tech
entrepreneurs techniques like this. They exist.
The ultimate freedom is a free mind, and we need technology that’s on
our team to help us live, feel, think and act freely.
We need our smartphones, notifications screens and web browsers to be
exoskeletons for our minds and interpersonal relationships that put our
values, not our impulses, first. People’s time is valuable
. And we should protect it with the same rigor
as privacy and other digital rights.

Group Silent Text/Circle/Mail/Phone, BlackPhone, used to have
standalone SMS app but they dropped it.
Group Whisper TextSecure/Signal, RedPhone, (to lesser degree partner
WhatsApp), did the same, but SMSSecure.
They have beta desktop version as chrome app.
Can always use any droid apps in emulator, such as ChatSecure.
And XOR modulo some printable charset any legacy SMS you care to send.
A number? AFAIK, yes, presumably depending if you went
opensource self path or not.
Phone numbers suck, which is why Pond, Ricochet, etc.
Mmm friends, and panda's, be seein ya soon.

Yet more news from the stupid-comes-full-circle dept...
Police do not need a warrant to obtain a person's cellphone location
data held by wireless carriers, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Tuesday,
dealing a setback to privacy advocates. The full 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, voted 12-3 that the government
can get the information under a decades-old legal theory that it had
already been disclosed to a third party, in this case a telephone
company. The ruling overturns a divided 2015 opinion from the court's
three-judge panel and reduces the likelihood that the Supreme Court
would consider the issue. The decision arose from several armed
robberies in Baltimore and Baltimore County, Maryland, in early 2011,
leading to the convictions of Aaron Graham and Eric Jordan. The
convictions were based in part on 221 days of cellphone data
investigators obtained from wireless provider Sprint, which included
about 29,000 location records for the defendants, according to the
appeals court opinion.
