@_subject: Money for Stffing Envelopes 
Recently I found your website for Stuff Envelopes as a job, My wife and I in the past have tried this type of work, we sent a payment, and never received the job packet they promised, we then call the Better Business Bureau(BBB), and to our surprise we had been taken for a ride(and lost our money);  How can we be sure the same thing is not going to happen again.  I have gone as far as to Call and E-Mail the BBB they state your company is not what you say it is, and they don't suggest we send any money("Why would you send money to start a job?"), I still am interested but scared to try this type work,  How can we be sure that what you say is true?  Please e-mail us back, if possible can we speak(Phone), If you have a phone number to call?
