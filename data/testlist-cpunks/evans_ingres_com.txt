@_subject: <sigh>  Can *somebody* remove "bobs@ingres.com" from this list? 
I've been trying all week to get someone to remove "bobs at ingres.com"
from this list.  Really, we are tired of seeing all the bounced emails
that this mailing list is trying to send here.
Who's *responsible* for this mailing list?  Any why haven't they responded
to my requests?
