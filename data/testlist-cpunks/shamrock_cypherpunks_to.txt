"There are, however, two companies working on devices that examine the
human iris,
 the most notably being IrisScan who owns the patent. The technique's
 advantage over retina scans is that it does not require the user to focus
on a target,
 because the iris pattern is on the eye's surface. In fact, the video
image of an eye can
 be taken from several up to 3 feet away, and the user does not have to
 actively with the device. Sensar, a company that has licensed the iris
 technology from IriScan hopes to position its IrisIdent product into ATMs
in the
 coming years."
I suggest you contact the manufacturer for more information.

Cypherpunks Tonga announces yet another version of SIO/STEST, the
universal smartcard software.
Quick summary of changes:
 - Philips, Gemplus, and Schlumberger reader support added
 - Chipknip (IEP) specific commands added
 - new internal commands
 - infrastructure for implementing card specific commands has been added
   (which the chipknip commands are built on top of)
At this point, we need others to start writing tables to support
additional cards. If you have an ISO7816 compatible smartcard with
programmer reference manual and minimal C knowledge, you can contribute to
the project. Full source is at

You can get started for ~$100. You need:
o Smartcard reader. You can sodder one yourself from the specs we have
online, or you can buy  one of the commercial reader we support. [To all
of you with commmercial readers we don't already support; how about
writing a table for our reader abstraction layer]?
We currently support the home-built Dumb Mouse, Schlumberger, Gemplus, and
Phillips readers. Either one of these outfits will sell you one of their
readers for ~$100. They are all equally capable. It doesn't matter
which one you get. The Gemplus reader looks the coolest. Email me if you
need a contact address.
o ISO7816-[3,4] -3 is online, -4 isn't yet, pending a good copy that can
be scanned. But you can get by with just 7816-3.  I am.
o A smartcard, ideally with programmer reference manual. Gemplus will send
you their reference in PDF and a sample GPK4000 (sig only) for free. Schlumberger will sell you 4 CryptoFlex cards for $80, but requires an NDA
for the manual. Bull is between card revisions and doesn't really have any
intresting crypto cards at the moment. Same with Siemens. If your interst
is more towards cash cards, we already have  support for Chipknip
(Proton). Beyond that, you are on your own. But if it speaks ISO7816, you
can write an STEST table for it. In fact, you can write the table from the
manual without ever touching a card. But this  is less gratifying. Still,
we would be thankful for any and all tables  added to STEST.

together with their overpriced toolkits, our reader uses only ISO
standards and can handle *any* smartcard. In addition, we developed drivers and fully-automated scanning software for UNIX and Win32. If you don't get results just by
typing "scan", then whatever you inserted isn't a smartcard.  :-) At this time, we need sample smartcards and documentation. Anonymous

The task would be much easier if I had one or several of the following:
o Mondex card Programer Reference Manual. Somebody on this list must have

o Protocol specifications. Even partial specs would be helpful.
o Any PC software that talks RS-232 to a reader that is meant to hold a
Mondex card. And of course the reader. If the reader work with non-Mondex
cards, all the better, because that probably means that the reader is
generic and the commands can be reverse engineered and emulated.
o An RS-232 adapter to the PCMCIA sized reader that came with my Chase
Mondex card and associated PC software. The reader has a tiny connector on
the side meant to connect to a serial port adapter. Since this is a
Mondex-only reader, I am not sure how much of the intelligence resides in
the reader. Listening to the communication between the PC software and

There are a number of technical reasons why you really don't want to call
the standard commandline Ecash client from a script to add/retrieve Ecash
from Mixmaster remailer packets. The biggest problem being that you can
fit only a few coins into the packet header as specified. There is
no feature in the standard Ecash client that allows coin level
control. DigiCash firmly resited and continues to resist adding it. A
$0.25 payment could be paid as three coins or as 25 coins. The user has no
control over this. For this and a number of other reasons, DigiCash's
software is unsuitable for the task.
You certainly could use DigiCash's software with Type 1 remailers. Though
why anybody would want to pay for a service as insecure as Type 1
remailers is beyond me. Type 1 remailers should be removed from service.
Furthermore, the barrier to entry is too high for the consumer. All these
problems are about to be solved by third party software. Perhaps then we
will see for-pay remailers.

[In reply to my claim that Type 1 remailers are fun toys. No more].
Correct. The adversary watches messages move in and out of the mix. [This
is quite easy to acomplish, given the security or lack thereof, of much
network infrastructure]. I really don't have the time to write an intro on
this topic. Subscribe to
the Bugtraq mailing list for a year and you'll understand what I mean.
Once you have all the mail going in and out, you make use of the simple
fact that Type 1 messages must shrink with each hop. See the classic
essay "Mixmaster & Remailer Attacks" at
IMHO, operating Type 1 remailers is doing the world a disfavor. It
provides a compromised technology  to a large number of people unaware of
the fact while, if anything, slowing down development and deployment of
better technology. Do you think it would have taken two (or more) years to
port Mixmaster to DOS had there been no Type 1 remailers? Of course not.
If you run a Type 1 remailer, do your users a favor: shut it down and
replace it with a Type 2.

I am not at all claiming that either lobbying or litigation is useless. By
all means, keep it up. It just won't change the fact that the ratchet
turns only into one direction. Until the ratchet breaks, but that is
another matter entirely and tends to be acompanied by lots of dead bodies.
I doubt we will find out anytime soon. Favors? Blackmail? Most likely

outright were they exposed to some of the traffic this list has seen over

Making the mag stripe on a driver license unreadable by a POS terminal is
easy. A refrigerator magnet will suffice. There is only one problem:
chances are you then won't be sold any alcohol.
See, major chains, such as the Southland corporation [7/11], recently
installed POS terminals that are linked to the cash register. [This may
not have reached a particular reader's area yet, please don't reply with
"but my 7/11 down the corner does not do this"].
Unless a driver license has been swiped, the cash register will not permit
the clerk to ring up the sale. It doesn't matter how old you are, you can
be 80 years old and in a wheelchair, no government issued ID with working
mag stripe, no alcohol or tobacco products for you.
The clerk at my local 7/11 assured me the information captured would not
be forwarded to a central site. Yet. It appears the stores are installing
these systems to protect themselves against police sting "test buys", in
which the authorities take persons just days shy of their 21st birthday,
put theater makeup and/or a gray beard and wig on them and thus entrap
store clerks into selling controlled substances to minors.
As any fool can predict, the information captured will not remain local
for long. After all, the system is ideal for monitoring gun^H^H^H alcohol

Using cheap analog equipment and one of the better HP frequency

the monitoring equipment to a specific PC. Even if there are numerous PC

On Wed Oct 28th at 5:12AM PST the main Rootshell page was defaced by a
group of crackers. Entry to the machine was made via SSH (secure shell)
which is an encrypted interface to the machine at 04:57AM PST this

the site was immediately brought offline. The site was back up and
operational by 8:00AM PST.
We are still in the process of investigating the exact methods that were

o Conventional software solutions offering public key authentication, such

o ArcotSignTM technology is a breakthrough that offers smart card tamper
resistance in software. Arcot is unique in this regard, and WebFort is the
only software-only web access control solution on the market that offers
smart card security, with software convenience and cost. [We have now

In my view (I suspect this may be in agreement with Tim's comments above,

trivially: the product fails to meet market requirements. Those willing to

watered-down, Mickey Mouse "privacy" Freedom provided.
Freedom does not offer the user untracable IP. Hence those seeking
untracable IP didn't buy the product. Little surprise here. Freedom's

I am afraid your interpretation of the history of mass-market access to the
Internet, as appealing as it may be to those blaming or praising Microsoft
for all the ills and good things of the digital universe, is quite
The Internet did not reach mass market penetration in the 1980's due to a
number of reasons, amongst them being that the average consumer didn't have:
o a GUI's
o cheap (or for that matter any) access to the Internet.
o IP to the home.
o a graphical web browser.
In the very early 90', not even shell accounts were available to the general
public. It wasn't until Netcom in the West and Pipeline and PSINet in the
East started offering flat-rate shell account access to the lucky few that
happened to live in the San Francisco Bay Area or NY that the average person
there could get any Internet access (other than email via AOL) at all.
But the VT100 renditions of gopher and even the marvelous lynx didn't
exactly draw big crowds.
Suddenly, the killer app Mosaic came about that was sufficiently compelling
to make the consumer want IP to the home. Since Mosaic, unlike lynx,
wouldn't work without an IP connection.
Meanwhile, SLIP/PPP accounts had just become available at any price.
Unfortunately, the USD 60 install and the USD 2 per hour charges proved
discouraging to all but a few. And again, unless you happened to live in one
of a few lucky areas, you didn't even have this rather pricey option.
The drive for Internet access came from Mac users. Few consumers had access
to Unix operating system based machines and Windows 3.1 lacked the Internet
applications. A host of which was readily available for the Mac and came
included on floppy in a book by Adam Engst that the novice Mac Internet user
probably wanted to read anyway. Most of them did.
Which left a single major barrier: $2/hour. This last and probably most
crucial barrier went away literally during the course of a weekend when a
Berkeley company called Cyberspace Development announced a revolutionary
product: The Internet Adapter (TIA). TIA was a user level program that
allowed the user to pull a SLIP connection out of a regular shell account.
The program spread like wildfire through the Netcom Macintosh user
community. Within that single weekend, dozens of people were using TIA.
Everybody said the same thing: "it works"!
Many shell providers banned TIA. Fortunately, Netcom did not. As one of
TIA's first users that very weekend, I wrote the "TIA mini-FAQ" on the spot,
explaining step-by-step in two pages how anybody with a Macintosh can get
hooked up with real IP within 30 minutes. At flat-rate shell prices. My
mini-FAQ was in stunningly high demand.
Faced with this sudden flat-rate competition, within a few months the first
SLIP/PPP provider went to a flat-rate model. Then another. Then a third.
Providers started sprouting up all over the place. People began using
Mosaic, which was quickly replaced by several other browsers that started
showing up for the Mac within a couple of months. Most of the improvements
in those new Mac browsers were copied by a new startup that was formed soon
thereafter. That company was Netscape. The remainder of Internet history I
presume most of us are aware of.

Natural monopolies are usually only found in extremely small markets.
The economic textbook example is a power company on an island of 50
people. The market size is simply too small to sustain the overhead of
two companies, no matter how efficient both companies may become.
Therefore, the market doesn't attract competitors, even absent any
regulatory market distortions. (Hence the "natural" in "natural
monopoly" :-)
But for whatever reasons, FreeS/WAN has been holding such a natural
monopoly position in by far the largest market in which I have ever seen
such a beast. I find this fascinating. I wonder if economists will some
day study the case to determine what factors brought it about.
[I presume somebody other than the FreeS/WAN project may have written a
few lines of Linux open source IPSec code, but they aren't competitors
in that market any more than a guy walking around with a charged car
battery offering service would be a competitor to the power company in
the island example].

The latest releases of both Suse and Mandrake are both able to install
kernels with Freeswan already integrated.  It's a little newer addition
to Mandrake, so you may want to use Suse.  Suse makes it easy to set up
encrypted file systems and other nice features.
The major problem that holds back the development of FreeS/WAN is with
its management.  [Management that cares more about sitting on its
pulpit, than getting useful software into the hands of people.] Unless
things have changed recently, they still won't accept contributions from
the US.  This makes no sense.  GPG is shipping with every Linux
distribution I know of, and the German's take contributions from the US.
The primary kernel developers have been willing to integrate crypto into
the kernel since the crypto regs were lowered.  It's the policy of no US
contributions that's holding back Linux IPSEC.
IMHO:  If Freeswan had never been created, an alternate, more mature
implementation would already exist in the mainline Linux kernel.

bearing on the suitability of Palm as an encrypting phone platform. As
for the hardware, it simply is underpowered. You can spend man-months
trying to fight the current underpowered Palm platform or you can use
the sufficiently-resourced PowerPC platform. Since I don't believe that
there is a requirement for the feature to operate on a device already in

The OS is really of secondary or tertiary concern here. The more
important question is which (if any) handheld hardware supports

Which of course represents the crux of the issue. The passengers aboard the
aircraft, the workers in the towers, and the emergency personnel on the
ground are dead for two reasons: the US unreasonably meddling in other
People's affairs until they crack, and the extremist gun control measures in
place in the US today, preventing law-abiding citizens from carrying the
firearm of their choice aboard a commercial aircraft. Who could deny that a
few citizens armed with their personal handguns could have stopped two or
three of guys armed with mere box cutters?
The nasty truth is that the tragic events of the day were to a large degree
caused by the victim disarmament policies of Diane Feinstein, Sarah Brady,
Chuck Schumer, and the many, many local, state, and federal proponents of
gun control. I hope they are happy. Not that I have any doubt that they will
be delighted, since today's tragedy will undoubtedly give them additional

Oh and Im sure having guns on board planes would work out great
especially considering the increase of people having huge fucking fits
and having to be held down on planes, yeah, lets arm people on planes.
Ignoring for a moment if it is indeed true that more airline passengers are
"having fits" (which is doubtful, but irrelevant to the point that I am
about to make) and furthermore ignoring why passengers may become
increasingly verbal about the unacceptable treatment they receive, I dare
say that there would be a rapid decrease in physical outbursts by
individuals on airplanes if a good number of the passengers were armed.
At gun ranges across the country, where just about everybody is armed,
physical violence is virtually nonexistent. Ever wonder why this is the
case? After thinking about it for a while, even the slower ones amongst us
might be able to figure out the cause.

have *zero* impact on the availability of strong crypto to criminals and
terrorists. Banning crypto would not increase anybody's safety. Except
perhaps the safety in office of dictatorial incumbent politicians. Which is
no concern of mine.
Of course, those calling for a ban on strong crypto are fully aware of this

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

FREE GUN TRAINING FOR COMMERCIAL PILOTS
LAS VEGAS, NEVADA:  In the aftermath of the World Trade
Center attack, Front Sight Firearms Training Institute,
which claims to be the world leader in providing intensified
courses in the defensive use of firearms for private
citizens and law enforcement alike, feels they have the
answer to stopping commercial airliners from being used as
ballistic missiles.  Front Sight will train every commercial
pilot in the world FREE OF CHARGE in the defensive use of
the handgun.  Front Sight will accept for training all
certified pilots and co-pilots from all commercial airliners
that submit a request for training on commercial airliner
letterhead, designating the pilot and co-pilot to carry a
handgun in the cockpit to defend access to the airliner. The
request for training letter must have the notarized
signature of the airline's chief executive.
Front Sight's Founder and Director, Dr. Ignatius Piazza
understands that his offer may offend those who lack resolve
in stopping terrorists from turning airliners into weapons
of mass destruction. However, he is quick to point out that
the World Trade Center attack is a new realm of terror, not
previously witnessed in the world. Prior to the World Trade
Center attack, terrorists were content to hijack planes and
divert them to safe landings in exchange for negotiated
release of imprisoned comrades. In extreme cases, terrorists
have committed suicide by exploding the grounded plane.
Airliners have also been targeted with bombs and possibly
missiles to spectacularly explode in flight, killing all on
board.  The World Trade Center attack was a new form of
terrorism, where the commercial airliner, loaded with fuel
for a cross country flight is redirected from the cockpit
and turned into an accurate missile of mass destruction.
Front Sight knows this form of terrorism can be stopped
immediately by arming all pilots and co-pilots and training
them in the proper methods of defending their cockpits.
"Commercial airliners must be willing to take an
uncompromising stand that will not allow anyone, under any
circumstances to access the controls of an airliner," says
Piazza. "The pilot and co-pilot, are responsible for the
security of the cockpit.  Without a handgun to defend it,
the cockpit crew is easily defeated.  However, when both
pilot and co-pilot are armed and trained by Front Sight,
they have the tools, ability, and will to defend themselves
and repel the murderous intent of terrorists. In an
emergency, the pilot can fly the plane to a safe landing
while the co-pilot covers the door of the cockpit- ready and
willing to use deadly force to prevent anyone from opening
the door."
Dennis Vied, a retired TWA Captain with 28 years of
experience flying commercial airliners and Front Sight
student fully agrees with Front Sight's solution.  Captain
Vied states, "The terrorists knew that they would face no
opposition to the hijacking, once they managed to get on the
airplane. All they had to do was threaten to do something to
a passenger, and they would be allowed access to the
cockpit. If that didn't work, then they just had to hurt
somebody, which in this case they did. Apparently they cut
the throats of two of the flight attendants. The terrorists
knew they would face no armed opposition, because the
airline screening process would insure that nobody on the
airplane would be armed. We have such an abhorrence to guns
that we fail to allow the good people to arm themselves for
defense. Therefore they are at the mercy of bad people- in
this case the terrorists. I sincerely hope that this is a
wakeup call to America. I think they should arm the crews,
or at least allow those that want to be armed to do so.
Otherwise, you're at the mercy of some crazy son-of-a-bitch
armed with a box cutter! How absolutely absurd!  There is so
much emphasis on prevention, and precious little emphasis on
the ultimate lines of defense."
Aaron Benedetti, a United Airline 747 co-pilot since 1990 is
a Platinum member at Front Sight and has already attended
Front Sight courses in defensive handgun, tactical shotgun,
and practical rifle. Through Front Sight's training,
Benedetti is ready, willing and able to defend the cockpit
of his aircraft if given the proper tools and authority to
do so.  Benedetti states, "We get recurrent training
regarding hijacking and security procedures, but the
training centers around placating and negotiating with the
terrorists to safely land the plane. We are told not to make
any aggressive move and to work toward a calm outcome.  The
World Trade Center disaster is a real blind spot in our
training. The attack reveals that perhaps the only way the
pilots could have stopped it would have been to deny access
to the cockpit and stop the terrorists from taking over the
controls of the plane by any means possible.  In the future,
we should consider that with the cockpit doors locked and
the co-pilot guarding the door with a handgun, calm
negotiations can still take place via intercom to land the
plane safely thus avoiding another World Trade Center
scenario."  Aaron Benedetti recommends all airlines to take
advantage of Front Sight's solution and offer.  He returns
to Front Sight later his year for further training on his
Lieutenant Bob Redmond, SWAT Commander of Nye County
Sheriff's Department concurs that Front Sight's training is
exactly what the commercial airliners need and that they
should immediately begin sending their pilots to Front
Sight. Redmond, who sends his SWAT officers to Front Sight
for firearms and tactical training states, "Front Sight's
training exceeds levels offered by most if not all law
enforcement agencies throughout the country.  Front Sight's
training is so good that I want every officer we have in the
department to attend every course Front Sight offers. If
airlines sent their pilots to Front Sight, it would be like
having SWAT officers in the sky."
Mark Donovan, a pilot for Southwest Airlines, who has taken
over ten Front Sight courses in the last two years finds the
current situation of unarmed pilots rather incredulous.
Donavan explains, "The political climate in commercial
aviation prior to the World Trade Center attack has not been
conducive to arming pilots.  In fact, just the opposite has
occurred.  Airlines have disarmed pilots to the point where
a terrorist with a box cutter can take over control of a
plane because no one is armed to defend the plane or
themselves.  Yet, numerous federal agencies are allowed to
carry a gun on commercial airlines, including such dubiously
qualified agencies as, Bureau of Engraving and Printing,
Department of Agriculture, Department of Education, and the
Smithsonian Institution!  Why are federal agents from these
obscure agencies allowed to carry a gun on board when a
pilot with firearms training from Front Sight Firearms
Training Institute is not allowed? My training at Front
Sight far exceeds anything the federal government offers to
these agencies."  Donovan continues, "If we, as pilots are
not given the means and authority to defend our aircraft as
a last means of defense, then who will?  It is apparent that
time was not available to negotiate with the madmen in the
World Trade Center attack.  Clearly, a properly trained
flight crew with a handgun could have saved countless lives.
Front Sight offers this training. I urge all federal
decision  makers to seriously examine Front Sight's solution
to the problem.  I believe it is the only credible answer to
stopping another horrendous tragedy."
Front Sight is the Solution to Gun Violence
Piazza reiterates, "Front Sight is truly part of the
solution to gun violence in this country.  Everyone agrees
that law enforcement should have the very best training
available.  Front Sight provides it.  And everyone agrees,
regardless of what side of gun control one stands, that if
law abiding private citizens are going to own firearms they
should be trained.  Front Sight provides such training to
levels that exceeds the law enforcement community.  Front
Sight now offers the solution to stopping and forever
preventing another World Trade Center attack by training
commercial airline pilots to be that last line of
defense for their passengers, airline, and our country.
Front Sight stands ready, willing, and able to serve."

@_subject: Utilizing Palladium against software piracy 
I would like to again thank the Palladium team, in particular Peter
Biddle, for participating in yesterday's panel at the USENIX Security
conference on Palladium and TCPA.
Unfortunately I do not have the time at the moment to write up the many
valuable and informative points made during the panel discussion. I
will, however, highlight one such issue:
As Peter pointed out, while the Palladium effort was started to meet the
content protection requirements of digital video content providers, he
also pointed out that Microsoft and its Palladium group have so far been
unable to determine a method in which Palladium could be utilized to
assist in the efforts against application software piracy. As Peter
mentioned, the Palladium team on several occasions had to tell the
Microsoft's anti-piracy group that Palladium is unsuitable to assist in
software (as distinct from content) licensing and anti-piracy efforts.
Since Microsoft is not aware of a method to utilize the Palladium
environment in the enforcement of software licenses, Peter argued,
Microsoft does not intend to and will not utilize Palladium to assist in
the enforcement of software licensing.
I, on the other hand, am able to think of several methods in which
Palladium or operating systems built on top of TCPA can be used to
assist in the enforcement of software licenses and the fight against
software piracy. I therefore, over the course of the night, wrote - and
my patent agent filed with the USPTO earlier today - an application for
an US Patent covering numerous methods by which software applications
can be protected against software piracy on a platform offering the
features that are slated to be provided by Palladium.

@_subject: FAQ: How will Microsoft respond to Lucky's patent application? 
I have received numerous questions in conversations and interviews over
the last few days as to what I believe Microsoft's response will be to
my recent patent application for methods that utilize Palladium and
operating systems built on top of TCPA to assist in the fight against
software piracy.
Rather than continuing to repeat the same answers in conversations, I
will simply make the answers available to the lists. Obviously, the
following is my personal opinion. I don't profess to speak for
Allow me to first outline some principles of how patents work in the
U.S. Note that I am not a member of the federal Patent Bar and as such
the following is simply my limited understanding of the process and
should not be construed as legal advice.
For a patent to be valid in the U.S., the idea to be patented must offer
utility, be novel, and be non-obvious. I will address the three
requirements as I believe they apply to my patent application in turn:
Utility: According to the Business Software Alliance's website, in the
financial loss to U.S. society due to software piracy in the year 2000
alone amounted to a staggering USD 7.2 billion. I therefore don't
believe it can be reasonably argued that methods that may help reduce
the level of software piracy lack utility. In particular, I don't
anticipate Microsoft to argue that protections against software piracy
that assist in the enforcement of licensing agreements lack utility.
Novelty: As I mentioned in my earlier post, Peter Biddle, Product Unit
Manager for Palladium, very publicly and unambiguously stated during
Wednesday's panel at the USENIX Security conference that the Palladium
team, despite having been asked by Microsoft's anti-piracy groups for
methods by which Palladium could assist in the fight against software
piracy, knows of no way in which Palladium can be utilized to assist
this end. Peter after the panel asked Brian LaMacchia, a well-known
security expert with Microsoft, who was present but not on the panel, if
he knew of a way to utilize Palladium to assist in the enforcement of
software licenses. Brian did not respond with a solution. (At that time
I briefly mentioned to both one of the methods in which I believe
Palladium can be used to assist in the fight against software piracy).
Peter, who obviously would have been aware of all such methods were they
known to the Palladium team, struck me as a forthcoming guy. While I
will readily admit that the impression I gained of the person over the
two hours I interacted with Peter may carry little weight with those
that consider the words Microsoft and honesty to be mutually exclusive,
I would like to point out the following:
If Microsoft, after so publicly denying any knowledge of ways to use
Palladium to assist in the enforcement of application software licenses
to an audience representing a veritable who's who of computer security
and related public policy (the attendees ranged from Whit Diffie to Pam
Samuelson), were to - after my filing for a patent - suddenly assert
prior art, neither the attendees, nor the press, nor the public would
take kindly to having been so deliberately misled by Microsoft.
The likely result would be that Palladium will lose what limited support
the initiative may have at this time. I suspect that even somebody that
may have a low opinion of Microsoft will agree that Microsoft is not as
stupid as to play such a dangerous and losing game.
I was asked the next day at USENIX if Microsoft could not simply claim
prior art when in fact they had none at the time my invention was made.
I would like to reiterate my points made above and add that such claims
would need to be filed under oath. Whatever one's opinion of Microsoft
may be, I doubt that the salaries paid in Redmond are sufficiently large
to goad a mid-level employee into committing perjury.
Lastly, it does not matter for the above analysis if any supposed prior
art were to  be claimed to be created by Microsoft or third parties. It
is simply inconceivable that the scientific members of the Palladium
team would have been unaware of any such prior art given the their many
years on the project and the thorough research they engaged in as
evidenced by the lengthy DRM OS patent. If prior art existed, the
Palladium team would unquestionably have known about it and thus been
able to tell their anti-piracy group and the attendees at USENIX about
methods to utilize Palladium as a tool in the fight against software
piracy. Since they did not, the reasonable conclusion is that no such
prior art exists.
Obviousness: In the interest of brevity, I will simply state that if the
Palladium team has not thought of such methods in the years they worked
the project every day, the methods mentioned in my patent application
cannot conceivably be considered obvious.
In summary, at this time I am not aware of any grounds on which
Microsoft could challenge my patent once/if it will be issued. I
therefore currently do not anticipate that Microsoft will challenge the
Lastly, I feel obliged to mention that it is quite irrelevant what I,
Microsoft, or the subscribers to this list believe to be the case with
respect to my patent application. All that matters is what the patent
examiner at the USPTO believes. Unless one of the subscribers to this
list happens to work as a patent examiner.

been ambiguous. I was trying to express that there was a cost constraint
on the part. Adding the cost of an EMBASSY or SEE environment to the
purchase of every new PC is more than the market for bare-bones or even
mid-range PC's will bear.

One thing to keep in mind is that the name of the CA on the
pre-installed root cert in some cases will bean no relation to the
actual issuer of the cert. Just because the business of
some.trusted.ca.nil has gone under does not mean their root keys are out
of circulation.
"Trusted roots" have long been bought and sold on the secondary market
as any other commodity. For surprisingly low amounts, you too can own a
trusted root that comes pre-installed in >95% of all web browsers
In fact, it is considerably more expensive for an aspiring public CA
provider to incur the costs of policies and procedures development,
equipment expenditures, auditing cost, etc. required to have a root
added to browsers nowadays than it is to just buy an existing trusted
CA's Chrysalis or nCipher HSM.

Precisely. Nor would worrying make any difference, since all CAs
preinstalled into the browser are equal from a user perspective. The
security  your CA, or VeriSign's CA, or anybody's CA can afford their
customer is subject to an upper bound set by the preinstalled CA with
the laxest certificate issuance standards in existence.
In other words, anybody who selects a public CA on a factor other than
price likely fails to understand the trust models that underlie today's
use of Certificate Authorities.
However, $250k will not nearly get you into the major browsers. Getting
into Netscape is easy. You just hand them the cash and the floppy with
your public key. Getting into MSIE is a lot harder. MSFT has never
charged to include a CA's key in MSIE and MSFT does not intend on
charging in the future. But after the root CA bonanza for MSIE 5, MSFT
instituted policy changes.
To get your CA's key included in MSIE, the CA must have passed an SAS 70
audit. (The CA also must offer its certificates to the public).
The infrastructure, policy, staff, and auditing costs of passing such an
audit will run you upwards of $500k.
By the end of the day, getting a new root into the browsers will cost
you about, give or take a few hundred k, $1M.
Which makes the slightly used nCipher box an even better value. :-)

I believe that Geotrust has come up with an excellent new model to make
money out of the CA business with minimum hassle to the customer while
reducing Geotrust's vetting costs down to next to zero. Their
introduction of this new model was one of the more interesting news at
this year's otherwise rather bland RSA Conference.
The cert shows as being issued by Equifax because Geotrust purchased
Equifax's root embedded in major browsers since MSIE 5 on the secondary
market. (Geotrust purchased more than just the root).

Steve is correct that the question if the 2nd Amendment imposes limits
on the ability of the States to regulate arms closely relates to whether
the Supreme Court holds that the 14th Amendment extends 2nd Amendment's
reach to the States.
However, the answer to this question is not one that will need to be
decided in the future. It has been decided over 125 years ago in one of
the first test cases of the then new 14th Amendment
In United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542 (1876), the Supreme Court
held that:
"The government of the United States, although it is, within the scope
of its powers, supreme and beyond the States, can neither grant nor
secure to its citizens rights or privileges which are not expressly or
by implication placed under its jurisdiction. All that cannot be so
granted or secured are left to the exclusive protection of the States."
"The right to bear arms is not granted by the Constitution; neither is
it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The
second amendment means no more than that it shall not be infringed by
Congress, and has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the
national government." As you can see by reading the entire case, the Court held not only that
the 14th Amendment does not extend the 2nd Amendment to the States, but
also held that the States are free to regulate firearms at their
leisure, in effect, the Court held that the 2nd Amendment solely
constrains Congress from infringing upon the right to keep and bear arms
while leaving the Executive free to infringe upon this right, or deny
its exercise entirely, at will.
In their ruling, the Supreme Court of course utterly ignored the
legislative history of the 14th Amendment that shows that the 14th
Amendment was put in place precisely to ensure, amongst other civil
rights, that the newly freed blacks would be able to arm themselves as a
protection from their militarily beaten, but no less racist, white
Under Cruikshank, Congress may not pass a bill infringing on the right
of the citizens to keep and bear arms, but a Presidential Executive
Order that all private citizens are to turn in their guns tomorrow
passes Constitutional muster.
The Supreme Court slightly soften their contention that the 2nd
Amendment was not worth the parchment it is written on (at least when it
comes to, horrors, blacks with guns) ten years later in Presser v.
Illinois, 116 U.S. 252 (1886).
"The provision in the Second Amendment to the Constitution, that 'the
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,' is a
limitation only on the power of Congress and the national government,
and not of the States. But in view of the fact that all citizens capable
of bearing arms constitute the reserved military force of the national
government as well as in view of its general powers, the States cannot
prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms, so as to deprive the
United States of their rightful resource for maintaining the public
security." Unfortunately, while at first glance being rather favorable to the right
to keep and bear arms, Court in Presser did not overturn the Court's
earlier determination in Cruikshank that the 14th Amendment does not
extend the 2nd Amendment to the States. While the Court has in the well
over 100 years that have since passed extended virtually the entire Bill
of Rights to the States via the 14th Amendment, it has failed to so with
the 2nd Amendment. The decision in Cruikshank that the 14th Amendment
does not extend the 2nd Amendment to the States stands has not only been
made by the Supreme Court, the decision stands to this day.

I have been meaning to set up a similar CA for years now, but never

what Thawte (a.k.a. VeriSign) is using to authenticate their free S/MIME

One might read the decision this way, if the Supreme Court had not
specifically written that "The second amendment means no more than that
it shall not be infringed by Congress".
The national government is simply mentioned in the decision because the
question at bar was if the 2nd applied to the States via the 14th. Under
Cruikshank, the Supreme Court ruled that it does not. The Court held
that the 2nd only constrained the national government, not the States,
and of the national government, only Congress.
Under Presser, such an executive order by the President would likely be
considered unconstitutional.
FYI, the Supreme Court has since revisited, and overturned itself, in
just about every aspect of Cruikshank, *except* that the 14th does not
extend the 2nd to the States. Which was the issue that Steve Schear
inquired about and to which I responded with my post.

Peter has an interesting point, since in addition to common law applies
to a trend in copyright that is prevalent in Europe (and presumably some
other countries), but rather alien to the US, taking that trend further.
For those readers not familiar with this trend, there is the gist of it:
Everybody on this list knows that what buyers of bit strings may or not
do with such bit strings, under pain of incarceration and, should you
resist that effectively, death, is under global attack by the MPAA and
its cohorts.
 What US observers are frequently less aware of is that the same right
is as much under attack, albeit for very different reasons, by the
European cultural elite which has been as effective as the MPAA in
working on their shared goal of dismantling what in the US would be
called the doctrine of first sale. In brief, this doctrine states that
if you buy a book, painting, or DVD, you may read or watch it for as
many times as you please (including not at all), loan it to your
friends, donate it to a library, sell it to somebody else, or chuck it
out with the trash.
The MPAA desires to dismantle the doctrine of first sale for the easily
understandable reason that the MPAA's members would like to approximate
as closely as possible to a state in which each person watching a movie
has to pay the studios each time the DVD is watched. If the technology
existed at a cost acceptable for a consumer device to count the number
of people present in a room watching a particular DVD, the MPAA likely
would lobby Congress to mandate that technology's inclusion to permit
for the collection of per-watcher/watching licensing fees.
The other half of the shears cutting away at the public's right to
entertain themselves with the artwork they purchased in any way they
please is represented by parts of the art culture of significant
political clout, in particular in Europe. Bills are pending or have
already passed, that make it illegal for a buyer of a work of art to
simply dispose of the work, or use it as kindling in his fireplace, once
he no longer desires to own it. No, you can't just burn that painting
you bought from some street corner painter five years ago. Though you
are permitted to give the painting back to the artist. Without
compensation, of course.
Between the corporate objective of charging the readers of a book each
time they read it and the elitist objective of forcing the buyer to read
a book they bought at least on occasion, with both groups united in
their zeal to impose their respective view points onto the public by
force of law and the men with sub-machine guns the law employs, the
future of copyright proves to be interesting. But you already knew that
While the European art circles clamoring for such moral right protection
acts would undoubtedly denounce the assertion that they are working hand
in glove with the MPAA's objective of dismantling the doctrine of first
sale to the detriment of society, the two groups in fact are natural
allies or pawns, depending on their level of awareness of the situation.
Undoubtedly this has not been overlooked by the MPAA, though I suspect
the European artists are blissfully unaware of how they have helped and
continue to help to grease the MPAA's skids.

@_subject: Ross's TCPA paper 
I recently had a chance to read Ross Anderson's paper on the activities
of the TCPA at
I must confess that after reading the paper I am quite relieved to
finally have solid confirmation that at least one other person has
realized (outside the authors and proponents of the bill) that the
Hollings bill, while failing to mention TCPA anywhere in the text of the
bill, was written with the specific technology provided by the TCPA in
mind for the purpose of mandating the inclusion of this technology in
all future general-purpose computing platforms, now that the technology
has been tested, is ready to ship, and the BIOS vendors are on side.
Perhaps the Hollings "Consumer Broadband and Digital Television
Promotion Act" bill would be more accurately termed the "TCPA Enablement
Act". BTW, the module that Ross calls a "Fritz" in his paper after the
author of the bill, long had a name: it is called a Trusted Platform
Module (TPM).
Granted, in the context of the TCPA and the Hollings bill, the term
"trusted" is used somewhat differently than the customers of future
motherboards, which are all slated to include a TPM, might expect:
"trusted" here means that the members of the TCPA trust that the TPM
will make it near impossible for the owner of that motherboard to access
supervisor mode on the CPU without their knowledge, they trust that the
TPM will enable them to determine remotely if the customer has a
kernel-level debugger loaded, and they trust that the TPM will prevent a
user from bypassing OS protections by installing custom PCI cards to
read out memory directly via DMA without going through the CPU.
The public and the media now need to somehow, preferably soon, arrive at
the next stage of realization: the involvement in the TCPA by many
companies who's CEO's wrote the widely distributed open letter to the
movie studios, telling the studios, or more precisely -- given that it
was an open letter -- telling the public, that mandating DRM's in
general-purpose computing platforms may not be a good idea, is
indicative of one of two possible scenarios:
1) the CEO's of said computer companies are utterly unaware of a major
strategic initiative their staff has been diligently executing for about
3 years, in the case of the principals in the TCPA, such as Intel,
Compaq, HP, and Microsoft, several years longer.
2) the CEO's wrote this open letter as part of a deliberate "good cop,
bad cop" ploy, feigning opposition to DRM in general computing platforms
to pull the wool over the public's eye for hopefully long enough to
achieve widespread deployment of the mother of all DRM solution in the
market place.
I do not know which of the two potential scenarios holds true. However,
I believe public debate regarding the massive change in the way users
will interact with their future computers due to the efforts of the TCPA
and the Hollings bill would be greatly aided by attempts to establish
which of the two scenarios is the fact the case.

Mike wrote quoting Lucky:
I agree with your assertion that TPM's can't prevent DRM from being
broken. Nor is this the intent of introducing TPM's. The vendors have
realized that they have to raise the technical bar only so high to keep
those most inclined to break their systems (i.e. 16-year old Norwegians)
from doing so. Those that have the knowledge and resources to break TCPA
systems either won't have the time because they are engaged in gainful
employment, won't be willing to take the risk, because they have
accumulated sufficient material possessions to be unwilling to risk
losing their possessions, not to mention their freedom, in litigation,
or will break the security for their own gain, but won't release the
crack to the public. Criminal enterprise falls into the latter category.
The content vendors, which in this case includes the operating system
and application vendors, dislike, but can live with, major criminal
enterprise being the only other party to have unfettered access, since
criminal enterprise is just another competitor in the market place. Most
business models can survive another competitor. Where business models
threaten to collapse is when the marginal cost of an illegal copy goes
to zero and the public at large can obtain your goods without payment. I
don't know if the TCPA's efforts will prevent this, but in the process
of trying to achieve this objective, the average computers users, and
even many advanced computer users, will find themselves in a new
relationship with their PC: that of a pure consumer, with only the
choices available to them the what the 180 TCPA's members digital
signatures permit.
Cloning TPM's is difficult, though not impossible. Note that all TPM's
unique initial internal device keys are signed at time of manufacture by
a derivative of the TCPA master key. Unless you are one of the
well-known chipset or BIOS manufacturers, you can't get your TPM
products signed. It is theoretically possible, though far from easy, to
clone an entire TPM, keys and all.
However, the moment those fake TPM's show up in the market place, their
keys will simply be listed in the next CRL update. And if your OS and
TPM's miss a few CRL updates, your commercial OS and all your
applications will stop working. As might in the future your video card,
your PCI cards, your hard drive, and your peripherals.
You can try to hack around the code in the OS or firmware that performs
the checks, as long as you are willing to operate your machine
permanently off the Net from then on, because your system will fail the
remote integrity checks, but given that this and other security relevant
code inside the OS and applications are 3DES encrypted and are only
decrypted inside the TPM, you can't just read the object code from disk,
but get to first microprobe the decrypted op codes off the bus before
taking a debugger to the code. Not a trivial task at today's PC bus
speeds. Nor can you get too aggressive with the hacks, since your Fritz
may simply flush the keys and leave you with a bunch of 3DES encrypted
op codes and no corresponding decryption keys. Reverse engineering turns
pretty dim at that point.
None of these obstacles are impossible to overcome, but not by Joe
Computer User, not by even the most talented 16-year old hacker, and not
even by many folks in the field. Sure, I know some that could overcome
it, but they may not be willing to do the time for what by then will be
a crime. Come to think of it, doing so already is a crime.

those years the TCPA effort and its predecessors have been underway,
(the design, and in fact the entire architecture, has morphed
substantially over the years) to be kicked off the very day of my post.
[Tim: do you recall when we had the discussion about the upcoming
"encrypted op code chips" at a Cypherpunks meeting in a Stanford lecture
hall? Was that 1995 or 1996? It cannot have been later; I know that I

"Palladium [Microsoft's TCPA-based technology - LG] is being offered to
the studios and record labels as a way to distribute music and film with
"digital rights management" (DRM). This could allow users to exercise
"fair use" (like making personal copies of a CD) and publishers could at
least start releasing works that cut a compromise between free and
locked-down. But a more interesting possibility is that Palladium could
help introduce DRM to business and just plain people. "It's a funny
thing," says Bill Gates. "We came at this thinking about music, but then
we realized that e-mail and documents were far more interesting
Another paragraph of the Newsweek article has this to say:
"In 1997, Peter Biddle, a Microsoft manager who used to run a paintball
arena, was the company's liason to the DVD-drive world. Naturally, he
began to think of ways to address Hollywood's fear of digital copying.
He hooked up with [...] researchers Paul England and John Manferdelli,
and they set up a skunkworks operation, stealing time from their regular
jobs to pursue a preposterously ambitious idea-creating virtual vaults
in Windows to protect information. They quickly understood that the
problems of intellectual property were linked to problems of security
and privacy.
        They also realized that if they wanted to foil hackers and
intruders, at least part of the system had to be embedded in silicon,
not software."
Well, now that Bill Gates himself is being quoted stating that DRM was a
driver behind the technology the TCPA is enabling (Microsoft is one of
the companies that founded the TCPA and should be in a position to
know), does Mr. Anonymous consider this sufficient "evidence that the
TCPA is being designed for the support of digital rights management
(DRM) applications"? Or does Anonymous continue to believe Ross and
Lucky are making this stuff up out of whole cloth?
To answer Anonymous's question as to whether the "the TCPA [is] really,
as [Ross and Lucky] claim, a secretive effort to get DRM hardware into
consumer PCs?", I am not sure I would exactly call this fact a secret at
this point. (Though by no means are all cards already on the table).
DRM is a significant objective of some of the TCPA's member companies,
which includes Microsoft.
There are of course other objectives. Some of which Ross published, some
which I mentioned, some which Steven Levy has published (though he

some which Bram has realized, and some which have yet to be talked

The cert that enables an application to run in trusted mode is tied to a

software vendor would need to extract the 2048-bit secret RSA key [1]
from their own motherboard's TPM, make the secret key available for
download, followed by the customer importing the key into their own TPM.
The TPM, for obvious reasons, offers no facilities to export or import
the TPM's internal keys.
The GPL cannot possibly require a software author to distribute a
hardware crack with their software or be in violation of the GPL.
Distributing a crack for TPM's is distributing an infringement device
and as such is illegal under US law. Even if the GPL were to be modified
to mandate what is technically near impossible to a software vendor to
achieve, even this layperson knows that contracts that require illegal
acts are unenforceable. Note that I am not referring to acts that might
be illegal in the future under the Hollings bill. Doing the above is
illegal today.
The GPL might be modified to require that the application vendor do
whatever is necessary for a user to utilize an application in the way
the user deems fit (i.e. in privileged mode), but that would put the GPL
into very dangerous, and I believe thoroughly undesirable, territory.
With such modifications, the hypothetical new GPL would mandate, to use
Richard Stallman's terminology, not just freedom of speech, but free
beer as well. That has never been the intend of the GPL.
Furthermore, the certs required to run the OS or application will in may
cases be issued by a party other than the application author or vendor.
To continue using Richard's terminology, to cover this case the GPL
would need to be rewritten to mandate that a third-party provide the
free beer.
I will leave it to the attorneys on this list to elucidate on the legal
deficiencies of such a hypothetical contract, since I am not an attorney

us back to Ross's point that the TCPA threatens the core of the GPL,
from which this discussion started. For completeness I would like to
state that I have no personal stake in the continued enforceability of
the GPL, being a long-time supporter of the BSD licensing scheme myself.
[1] 1024-bit RSA keys were rejected during the design phase of the TPM
by members of the TCPA, which, as Anonymous pointed out in a previous
post, contains several well-known crypto companies. The TCPA's website,
which only makes specs, but not design documents, available to the
public, unfortunately does not provide any documentation which reasoning
lead to this decision.

@_subject: Two additional TCPA/Palladium plays 
[Minor plug: I am scheduled to give a talk on TCPA at this year's DEF
CON security conference. I promise it will be an interesting talk.
 ]
Below are two more additional TCPA plays that I am in a position to
1) Permanently lock out competitors from your file formats.
"A more interesting possibility is that Palladium could help introduce
DRM to business and just plain people. It's a funny thing," says Bill
Gates. "We came at this thinking about music, but then we realized that
e-mail and documents were far more interesting domains."
Here it is why it is a more interesting possibility to Microsoft for
Palladium to help introduce DRM to business and "just plain people" than
to solely utilize DRM to prevent copying of digital entertainment
It is true that Microsoft, Intel, and other key TCPA members consider
DRM an enabler of the PC as the hub of the future home entertainment
network. As Ross pointed out, by adding DRM to the platform, Microsoft
and Intel, are able to grow the market for the platform.
However, this alone does little to enhance Microsoft's already sizable
existing core business. As Bill Gates stated, Microsoft plans to wrap
their entire set of file formats with DRM. How does this help
Microsoft's core business? Very simple: enabling DRM for MS Word
documents makes it illegal under the DMCA to create competing software
that can read or otherwise process the application's file format without
the application vendor's permission.
Future maintainers of open source office suites will be faced with a
very simple choice: don't enable the software to read Microsoft's file
formats or go to jail. Anyone who doubts that such a thing could happen
is encouraged to familiarize themselves with the case of Dmitry
Skylarov, who was arrested after last year's DEF CON conference for
creating software that permitted processing of a DRM-wrapped document
file format.
Permanently locking out competition is a feature that of course does not
just appeal to Microsoft alone. A great many dominant application
vendors are looking forward to locking out their competition. The beauty
of this play is that the application vendors themselves never need to
make that call to the FBI themselves and incur the resultant backlash
from the public that Adobe experienced in the Skylarov case. The content
providers or some of those utilizing the ubiquitously supported DRM
features will eagerly make that call instead.
In one fell swoop, application vendors, such as Microsoft and many
others, create a situation in which the full force of the U.S. judicial
system can be brought to bear on anyone attempting to compete with a
dominant application vendor. This is one of the several ways in which
TCPA enables stifling competition.
The above is one of the near to medium objectives the TCPA helps meet.
[The short-term core application objective is of course to ensure
payment for any and all copies of your application out there]. Below is
a mid to long term objective:
2) Lock documents to application licensing
As the Levy article mentions, Palladium will permit the creation of
documents with a given lifetime. This feature by necessity requires a
secure clock, not just at the desktop of the creator of the document,
but also on the desktops of all parties that might in the future read
such documents. Since PC's do not ship with secure clocks that the owner
of the PC is unable to alter and since the TCPA's specs do not mandate
such an expensive hardware solution, any implementation of limited
lifetime documents must by necessity obtain the time elsewhere. The
obvious source for secure time is a TPM authenticated time server that
distributes the time over the Internet.
In other words, Palladium and other TCPA-based applications will require
at least occasional Internet access to operate.
It is during such mandatory Internet access that licensing-related
information will be pushed to the desktop. One such set of information
would be blacklists of widely-distributed pirated copies of application
software (you don't need TCPA for this feature if the user downloads and
installs periodic software updates, but the user may choose to live with
application bugs that are fixed in the update rather than see her unpaid
software disabled).
With TCPA and DRM on all documents, the application vendor's powers
increase vastly: the application vendor can now not just invalidate
copies of applications for failure to pay ongoing licensing fees, but
can invalidate all documents that were ever created with the help of
this application. Regardless how widely the documents may have been
distributed or on who's computer the documents may reside at present.
Furthermore, this feature enables world-wide remote invalidation of a
document file for reasons other than failure to pay ongoing licensing
fees to the application vendor. To give just one example, documents can
be remotely invalidated pursuant to a court order, as might be given if
the author of the document were to distribute DeCSS v3 or Scientology
scriptures in the future DRM protected format. All that is required to
perform such an administrative invalidation of a document is either a
sample copy of the document from which one can obtain its globally
unique ID, the serial number of the application that created the
document, or the public key of the person who licensed the application.
(Other ways to exist but are omitted in the interest of brevity).

Bob wrote quoting Mark Hachman:
An EMBASSY-like CPU security co-processor would have seriously blown the
part cost design constraint on the TPM by an order of magnitude or two.
I am not asserting that security solutions that require special-purpose
CPU functionality are not in the queue, they very much are, but not in
the first phase. This level of functionality has been deferred to a
second phase in which security processing functionality can be moved
into the core CPU, since a second CPU-like part is unjustifiable from a
cost perspective.
Given the length of CPU design cycles and the massive cost of
architecting new functionality into a processor as complex as a modern
CPU, we may or may not see this functionality shipping. Much depends on
how well phase 1 of the TCPA effort fares.

The TCPA specs were carefully designed to permit the user to obtain
multiple certificates from multiple CA's and thus, if, and that's a big
if, the CA's don't collude and furthermore indeed discard the true name
identities of the customer, utilize multiple separate identities for
various online applications. I.e., the user could have one cert for
their True Name, one used to enable Microsoft Office, and one to
authenticate the user to other online services.
It is very much the intent of the TCPA to permit the use of pseudonymous
credentials for many, if not most, applications. Otherwise, the TCPA's
carefully planned attempts at winning over the online liberty groups
would have been doomed from the start.

However, enabling platform security, as much as might be stressed
otherwise by the stakeholders, has never been the motive behind the
TCPA. The motive has been DRM. Does this mean that one should ignore the
benefits that TCPA might bring? Of course not. But it does mean that one
should carefully weigh the benefits against the risks.

You may be asking yourself: where, oh where, has all the crypto gone?
Where are the BlackNet's? Where is the untraceable Ecash? Where is the
Cryptanarchy that we've been waiting for? For that matter...where is the
The staunchest Cypherpunk will by now have noticed that PGP/GPG usage
even amongst list members, once the bellwether indicator of Cypherpunks
crypto adoption success, is in decline.
NAI has pulled PGP off the shelves. Conspiracy theories as to what may
have been driving this business decision abound. The fact of the matter
is that the usage of PGP by businesses, the sole significant source of
NAI PGP revenue, had long passed its peek. How many business do you know
that rolled out PGP in the last year? How many do you know that quietly
stopped using PGP after formally adopting its use with big fanfare a few
years ago? The facts are that there are more of the latter than of the
former. Did NAI receive The Briefing? I don't know. Nor does it really
matter. There wasn't enough money to be made with PGP.
A well-respected Cypherpunk recently expressed hope that if NAI's PGP
were to disappear for good, perhaps compatibility problems amongst
versions of PGP would diminish. A plausible sounding theory, if one were
to assume that the compatibility problems amongst versions of PGP are
between versions produced by different vendors. Presumably, the theory
would go, with only one major supplier left standing, that being GPG
(yes, I am aware there are others), interop problems with other vendors'
implementations would pretty much disappear by definition.
However, a closer inspection of the PGP interoperability problems, which
have been at one of the issues coming up in just about every single
discussion I've had with anybody about PGP over the last year, shows
that the interop problems are not between current versions by multiple
vendors, but between versions, in some cases by the same vendor, that
were released over time. The current version of NAI-PGP will
interoperate just fine with the current version of GPG.
So why is PGP interoperability such a frequently raised issue? And why
does the importance of this topic seem to diminish the further away you
stray from Cypherpunks into the realms of the casual PGP users? The
answer to the second question is straight-forward. Even the most casual
user of software tends to be familiar with and acceptant of the need for
occasional software upgrades. It appears that those that are
experiencing interop problems are those that are insisting on using up
to 5-year old versions of PGP. It is true and should come as no surprise
that those 5-year old versions do indeed have interop problems with
newer versions of PGP.
Some may say: I shouldn't need to keep on upgrading my software to be
able to send encrypted email. Does anybody seriously believe that those
that insist on using 5-year old versions of PGP have not upgraded their
operating systems in those 5 years? Indeed, upgraded more their
operating systems more than once? Or does anybody seriously believe that
those that insist on using old versions of PGP still run the exact same
version of their MUA and text editor as they did 5 years ago? Of course
they don't. If they did, their boxes would long have become unusable due
to the warez traffic taking place on the machines as a result of the
countless remote exploits discovered over these last 5 years.
The reluctance to upgrade to a newer version of PGP does not appear to
be driven by a refusal or inability to upgrade software in general. This
reluctance to upgrade appears PGP specific. Why this is the case I do
not know. (And don't greatly care. I am running the latest version of
NAI PGP and I can make my copy talk to any version of PGP 2.x or
Now perhaps there may be the rare case of a PGP user that is still
running PGP 2.x on the same DOS box, using the same mailer and the same
text editor as they did 5 years ago. I don't know of any such users, but
that doesn't mean no such users exists within the vastness of the
Internet. What I do know is that those that I am aware of that are
complaining about PGP version interoperability problems do not fall into
the rare category of users who have not upgraded any software at all for
the last 5 years.
Since the existence of multiple PGP software providers has not been the
cause of the interop problems experienced by some, reducing the number
of PGP implementation providers should not be expected to have a
significant impact on the number or severity of PGP interop problems
experienced by the users.
The same Cypherpunk expressed a hope that absent NAI's PGP, the German
government group currently funding GPG might be more inclined to fund UI
work for Windows. Perhaps they would. Assuming for a moment they will,
would this lead to a better PGP Windows UI than NAI's PGP offered? NAI's
PGP UI is pretty darn good. Looking at the sorry state of UI's currently
offered for GPG, even with government funding, I suspect that it will be
a long time indeed before we will see a GPG UI that will compare
positively to the current NAI PGP UI. Of course Cypherpunks know that it
is dangerous to base one's hope for the development of a Cypherpunk
tools on funding by a government. Be that the US government or the
German government. Strongly pro-crypto German governmental officials
have been know for their propensity to stumble out of the windows of
high story buildings. Warnings regarding the dangers that may lure in
parking lots come to mind.
Where has the crypto gone? The crypto has gone under the hood, away from
the UI, to a place where the crypto will be of most use to the average
user. Yes, for crypto to be secure against the active, well resourced,
attacker, the crypto must at one point touch the user to permit the user
to make a trust decision. But to secure communications from passive
and/or less resourced attacker, crypto can be placed under the hood.
I bet a good percentage of the readers of this list that still require
to be engaged in a form of employment nowadays access their company
network via some form of VPN. Up by orders of magnitude from a few years
ago. More importantly, a good percentage of users that have never heard
of this mailing list and will never hear of this mailing list are using
strong crypto to access their company's information. The percentage of
users utilizing strong crypto is increasing daily.
Another major segment of Internet infrastructure in which strong crypto
is rapidly becoming the default rather than the exception, at least
amongst those running their own servers, is SMTP. The percentage of SMTP
connections to my mail server that use TLS to encrypt SMTP has grown
from around 30% a few months ago to well over 60% today. This increase
in the use of STARTTLS on SMTP appears to parallel a loss of sendmail
MTA market share in favor of postfix. It is just too darn easy to turn
on support for STARTTLS during a migration to postfix, hence most sites
performing such a migration appear to do so.
(I am aware that sendmail and qmail support STARTTLS as well, but the
increases in the use of STARTTLS that I am seeing at my SMTP server
coincides with sites switching MTA's to postfix. I see a handful of
qmail sites using TLS, representing a fraction of the postfix sites, and
no sendmail site that I have noticed. Having once considered activating
STARTTLS in sendmail myself, I vividly recall myself reading the
instructions, bursting out laughing, followed by my researching
competitive MTA's. Within a week I had switched to postfix. Wished I had
done so years ago. All these hours that I wasted over those years...
An interesting side-effect of the increased adoption of MTA's and MUA's
that support STARTTLS is that I now have a link that is secure against
passive eavesdroppers to the majority of those with whom I regularly
correspond in encrypted email. Is protection against only passive
eavesdroppers good enough for me? No. Are we a heck of a lot further
along than we were 5 years ago? I would argue that we are.
Where has all the crypto gone? It has gone mainstream. Some of you may
remember the discussions from years ago how we should try to find a way
to make crypto cool and attractive for the average person.
This afternoon, I installed the "Britney Spears SmartFlash Kit" on my
Windows XP test box. For $29.95 plus shipping and handling, you too can
own a Britney SmartFlash Kit, which includes a USB smartcard reader, a
Gemplus smartcard (both the reader and card are graced with pictures of

Acts that are potentially slightly illegal and certainly considered
naughty by some carry more appeal to many than acts that are
unquestionably as above board as they are boring. Once the export regs
changed and more advanced uses of cryptographic applications failed in
the market place, crypto lost some of its sex appeal to its initial
early-adopter rebel constituency.
I believe our viewpoint coincide, rather than conflict. Crypto has gone
under the hood, it is used by anybody accessing an https website, which
nowadays is just about anybody with a web browser. Crypto is used by
many corporate employee's accessing the corporate VPN. It is the rare
Internet user, of which there are of course many more than there were
Cypherpunks got started, that does not employ strong crypto in some
Agreed. Which is why I pointed out that the encryption taking place
under-the-hood tends to be a reasonable defense against a passive or
less-resourced attacker while being frequently unsuitable against the
active, well-resourced attacker. Though I would contend that there are
more of the former than there are of the latter, I too continue to
utilize, as I pointed out, strong crypto that requires active user
interaction permitting the trust decision to occur. I indeed consider passive encryption methods alone to be typically
insufficient for some of my personal security needs and am continuing to
utilize encryption that requires me as the user to make that trust
decision. But that does not mean that no security benefits are to be had
from opportunistic encryption of Internet traffic.
Example: the other day I sent an email to a friend that accidentally
failed to PGP encrypt. The email did not contain truly critical
information, but I certainly would have preferred for neither my
friend's nor my ISP to have ready access to the cleartext of that email.
Fortunately, we had encrypted SMTP connections end-to-end, thus
protecting the contents of the email from the ISP's, albeit perhaps not
from the NSA.
Lastly, allow me to address the issue raised that many IM protocols in
use today do not support crypto at this time. This is true, but I
noticed that a good majority of the P2P efforts introduced at CODECON
all included support for encryption as part of the protocol. The various
developers had read Applied Cryptography, understood a sufficient part
of it, and made provisions to design crypto into their protocols from
the beginning rather than as an adjunct to be thought about later. While
the details of the initial implementations were of varying quality, one
project began by using Blowfish in ECB mode until the developer realized
that he could see patterns in the ciphertext, but changing a protocol
during alpha testing to use a secure mode of a block cipher given that
the protocol already contains all the hooks for crypto, may be
considerably easier than gluing crypto onto some of the existing IM
Given the rapid changes in the P2P space, just because some IM and P2P
systems today fail to offer cryptographic protections should not be
taken as an indicator that these protocol's successors will not offer
transparent crypto as a default feature.
One such project that I have been somewhat following is the Anonymous
IRC project. While their design is far from perfect, it is one of many
steps into the right direction. There are dozens of similar projects underway, all employing crypto,
that may one day replace the prevalent IM clients as rapidly as Gnutella
and later Kazaa and Morpheus replaced Napster.
How does the increased use of strong crypto under-the-hood help
Cypherpunks? The answer reminds me of the response another Cypherpunk
gave to my posting statistics about the nature of the USENET traffic
seen by a major node. I expressed surprise at these rather revealing
statistics, musing that there had to be a lesson to be learned from the
fact that the bulk of the data is generated in newsgroups that one would
not initially consider mainstream. His response was illuminating: "Yes,
the lesson is: just look at all that cover traffic".

Here is a partial list of requirements that I believe apply to drive
encryption cryptographic systems. I am sure that list is incomplete and
may contain errors. The following is what springs to mind:
1) I do not believe that there is a fundamental need to limit the size
of the ciphertext to the size of the plain text. Adding a 1% or even
more space overhead for encryption is acceptable under any day-to-day
scenario that I can think of.
2) The algorithm must be able to decrypt individual sectors without
having to decrypt the entire contents of the drive. Nor must the
algorithm leak any plaintext, even if the attacker were to have
knowledge of all but one byte of the plaintext stored on the drive.
3) The encrypted partition should leak no information about the number,
nature, and size of any files stored on the drive. Unless one has access
to the key, the entire partition should be appear to the observer as a
homogenous block of opaque encrypted data.
4) It would be nice, but is not in the least required, to be able to
convert an existing unencrypted partition to an encrypted partition and
5) It must be possible to pass the encryption key as a parameter to
mount, presumably in the form of a config file containing they key to
prevent the key from showing up in ps.
6) It should be possible to both specify a raw AES key as well as a
passphrase-derived SHA2 generated AES key.
7) Since the key will need to be stored in RAM for extended periods of
time, the key should be protected from forensic recovery by being never
being swapped to disk as well as by periodic bit-flipping.
8) Ideally, and this is definitely a feature for v2.0, each user would
be able to specify a capability that will permit the listing and access
of any files under that user's permissions on the encrypted file system.
9) While steganographic file systems offering multiple levels of
credible distress keys are nice, I don't consider this a feature that
should be included in v1.0.

Peter wrote [about the benefits of STARTTLS]:
I must concur with Peter. The overwhelming majority of email recipients
with whom I routinely exchange PGP encrypted email operates their own
MTAs, located within their trust boundaries. Which should come as no
surprise, since those with whom I discuss topics requiring secure
communications tend to be conscious of security and thus like to be able
to control the properties of their MTA and other network services.
I also agree that current MTAs' implementations of STARTTLS are only a
first step. At least in postfix, the only MTA with which I am
sufficiently familiar to form an opinion, it appears impossible to
require that certs presented by trusted parties match a particular hash
while certs presented by untrusted MTAs can present any certificate they
desire to achieve EDH-level security.
I am aware that the certs presented by trusted parties could of course
all be signed by the same CA, but this is an unworkable model in
personal communications. What is required in practice is a list of
trusted MTAs with corresponding hashes implemented at the MTA level.

This looks very similar to the dLock device.
Perhaps they are using the same ASIC? If so, the product is pure crap.
Based on conversations that I had with the booth staff at the last RSA
conference, the dLock employs DES and 3DES in ECB mode. Meaning the
ciphertext on disk can be broken with the most trivial of cryptanalysis.

ssh2 is in essence a re-invention of what SSL did without having to use
X.509 keys. This reinvention was, IMHO, largely the result of the
limitations of the ssh1 design.
I trust that we can agree that the volume of traffic and number of
transactions protected by SSL are orders of magnitude higher than those
protected by SSH. As is the number of users of SSL. The overwhelming
majority of which wouldn't know ssh from telnet. Nor would they know
what to do at a shell prompt and therefore have no use for either ssh or
Given that SSL use is orders of magnitude higher than that of SSH, with
no change in sight, primarily due to SSL's ease-of-use, I am a bit
puzzled by your assertion that ssh, not SSL, is the "only really

The Supreme Court won't rock the boat because it built the boat in Dread
Scott, part II, known amongst lawyers as "United States v. Cruikshank".
(Most of the following is from a post to this list I made in 2002).
 [...]The question if the 2nd Amendment imposes limits on the ability of the States to regulate arms closely relates to whether
the Supreme Court holds that the 14th Amendment extends 2nd Amendment's reach to the States. However, the answer to this question is not one that will need to be decided in the future. It has been decided over 125 years ago in one of the first test cases of the then new 14th Amendment In United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542 (1876), the Supreme Court held that: "The government of the United States, although it is, within the scope of its powers, supreme and beyond the States, can neither grant nor secure to its citizens rights or privileges which are not expressly or by implication placed under its jurisdiction. All that cannot be so granted or secured are left to the exclusive protection of the States." "The right to bear arms is not granted by the Constitution; neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The second amendment means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress, and has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government." As you can see by reading the entire case, the Court held not only that the 14th Amendment does not extend the 2nd Amendment to the States, but also held that the States are free to regulate firearms at their leisure, in effect, the Court held that the 2nd Amendment solely constrains Congress from infringing upon the right to keep and bear arms
while leaving the Executive free to infringe upon this right, or deny its exercise entirely, at will. In their ruling, the Supreme Court of course utterly ignored the legislative history of the 14th Amendment which shows that the 14th Amendment was put in place precisely to ensure, amongst other civil rights, that the newly freed blacks would be able to arm themselves as a
protection from their militarily beaten, but no less racist, white neighbors. Under Cruikshank, Congress may not pass a bill infringing on the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms, but a Presidential Executive Order that all private citizens are to turn in their guns tomorrow passes Constitutional muster. As would any State laws banning any and
all possession of firearms by civilians.
The Supreme Court slightly soften their contention that the 2nd Amendment was not worth the parchment it is written on (at least when it
comes to, horrors, blacks with guns) ten years later in Presser v. Illinois, 116 U.S. 252 (1886). "The provision in the Second Amendment to the Constitution, that 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,' is a limitation only on the power of Congress and the national government, and not of the States. But in view of the fact that all citizens capable
of bearing arms constitute the reserved military force of the national government as well as in view of its general powers, the States cannot prohibit the people from keeping and bearing arms, so as to deprive the United States of their rightful resource for maintaining the public security." Unfortunately, while at first glance being rather favorable to the right
to keep and bear arms, Court in Presser did not overturn the Court's earlier determination in Cruikshank that the 14th Amendment does not extend the 2nd Amendment to the States. While the Court has in the well over 100 years that have since passed extended virtually the entire Bill
of Rights to the States via the 14th Amendment, it has failed to so with
the 2nd Amendment. The decision in Cruikshank that the 14th Amendment does not extend the 2nd Amendment to the States stands has not only been
made by the Supreme Court, the decision stands to this day. --Lucky Green

I spent the last few months working at PGP on a nifty new solution to an
old problem: how to get email encryption deployed more widely without
requiring user education.
Since ideas for solving this problem have been discussed on this mailing
list for over 10 years now, some of you might wish to take a peek at the
solution that we came up with. The public beta of PGP Universal 1.1 is
now yours to download for free from
One of the many interesting features of our approach is the ability to
secure all users of a mail server, without the users needing to
understand what encryption is or does, no need for MUA-specific plugins,
interchangeable use of PGP keys or S/MIME, and much more. And yes, you
can still keep your 4096-bit RSA key on your PC only. I am using PGP
Universal myself. It is really cool.
Note that the download of PGP Universal is 322MB in size and requires a
dedicated x86 server to install.
Have fun,

I since ran additional tests. All tests are for 1024-bit RSA signatures.
1) OpenSSL as shipping with the RedHat Taroon beta for Athlon 64:
921 RSA signatures/second
2) OpenSSL compiled manually:
1313 RSA signatures/second
3) Performance benchmark application made available to reviewers:
Exceeding 3800 RSA signatures/second.
Reading various gamer and over clocker websites, the Athlon 64 general
performance is testing at about par with the Intel P4 3.2GHz, faster in
some tests, slower in others. With the Athlon 64 being the slightly less
expensive CPU based on the prices I have seen around here. You basically
get a 64-bit CPU for the price of a 32-bit CPU.
The CPU seems to be catching on amongst the early adopter crowd. A
friend just bought one for 32-bit gaming and is very pleased.
Motherboards for the Athlon 64 are appearing rapidly. Two weeks ago,
Fry's stocked one Athlon 64 motherboard. Today, Fry's had 3 of them.

@_subject: CFP: What the Hack '05 and Blind Signature Expiration Party 
Hash: SHA1
[Please forward as appropriate]
Call for Participation: Cypherpunks at "What the Hack '04" and "Blind
Signature patent expiration party". As every four years, this year features "What the Hack (WTH)", a Dutch
outdoors security and hacker conference hosted in the tradition of HEU '93,
HIP '97, and HAL 2001. HIP '97 and the Summer that surrounded it represented a pivotal event in my
and many other attendee's lives. 1997 was the peek of the Crypto Wars: while
strong cryptography was spreading rapidly throughout the world from authors
outside the U.S., most, if not all, I consider dear friends, the U.S.
Government continued to insist on imposing draconian export regulations.
3DES? 1024-bit RSA? Forget it.
In about May '97, PGP, Inc. released printed copies of the PGP 5 source code
in full compliance with the U.S. export regulations in effect at the time.
Electronic copy was illegal, but printed books were fine. Having attended
the source code release event, at a Cypherpunks meeting, I walked away with
two copies of the printed source. The source code books spanned many boxes.
I hurt my back lifting those heavy boxes into the trunk of my car. My back
to this day never fully recovered. Equally in compliance with the export
laws, I immediately fedexed those boxes at my own expense to individuals in
Europe standing by with scanners equipped with sheet feeders to OCR the
Three months later, the OCR effort had stalled. While most pages had been
OCR'ed, passing the per-page checksums, many pages remained unprocessed. In
some cases this was because one of the numerous proof readers failed to
return the result. In the more challenging cases it was because the checksum
differentiated between spaces and tabs. We learned that consumer-level OCR
programs are dismal at differentiating between 5 or 6 leading spaces. Or a
At HIP '97 on a camp ground near Amsterdam, many breakthroughs happened.
- - I organized a industrial-size tent, complete with full (free) bar and DJ,
for Cypherpunks types.
- - The all-night DJ, and at least in part the free bar, drew a number of
walk-ins, including some young smartcard hackers that pointed out to me that
the ISO 7816 smart card specifications required the card to report a
different error code depending on whether a file on the smart card file
system did not exist or was blocked from read access. And by the way, the
key space is only two bytes wide. It is this kind of crack in the armor into
which a cryptanalyst will find it irresistible to insert a crowbar. If it
weren't for this revelation over a glass of Single Malt and the much deeper
investigations that followed, COMP128 would still be considered to be a good
authentication and key generation algorithm and GSM would still be
considered secure from cloning and eavesdropping.
- - The discussions on the Cypherpunks list in the preceding year or two had
made it clear to those paying attention that MIX-style remailer networks, as
promising as they appeared at first, are a dead end against a motivated
adversary. The better approach, and the only alternative known at the time,
was to apply the lessons learned from DC nets to establish mailbox servers
that used XOR chains to obtain the content dropped into public read-access
boxes. I gave a talk at HIP '97 that detailed a system that implemented this
concept (*). The concept I introduced at HIP '97 is by now well-know and
since has not just been given a name, but has turned into an entire field of
academic research: Private Information Retrieval (PIR).
(*) Credit for the ideas behind this presentation go to an individual that
so far has chosen to remain anonymous.
- - With the attentative audience still mentally digesting the novel concept
of PIR, I took the opportunity to add a "Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse
delendam". My precise words, if I recall correctly, were: "Come Hell or high
water, before HIP is over, the proofreading of the PGP source code *will* be
completed". Followed by a call for non-U.S. citizen volunteers to report to
the Cypherpunks tent to finish the job. And finish the job they did.
Visualize a scene most akin to "The Matrix", with a gaggle of volunteers
frantically working on a row of computers held up by beer crates, writing
scripts to brute force the OCR output past the checksums, while a raging
party with dancers literally hanging off the rafters took up the core of the
tent space, music blasting from the sound system in the early morning hours.
Special thanks go to Ian Grigg, who lead the team of volunteers.
On the last day of HIP, the last page of the PGP 5 source had passed the
last checksum. As the volunteers retired to bed after in most cases over 48
hours of straight work, one lone hold-out decided that now that the source
code had been legally exported and turned into electronic form, somebody
ought to compile it. He proceeded to compile the PGP 5 source on a PC that I
had hand-carried to HIP in my luggage. The source compiled without errors. I
was sound asleep at the time. By the time I woke up, cryptography had
entered a new era: the U.S. Government, and in fact the entire world, woke
up to a day from which on the only path remaing to stem the flow of strong
crypto out of the U.S. was to ban books. And even the staunchest advocates
of cryptographic export regulations knew that albeit the U.S. Supreme Court
Justices may perhaps be bamboozled by declarations of the dangers of this
new "Internet" thing, banning books was a proposal not in the least novel to
the Court, standing no chance of meeting with the Justices approval.
Cornered into an untenable position and with no help from the courts in
sight, the U.S. Government eventually acknowledged the inevitable and
relaxed the exports laws for strong cryptography to the point of
insignificance in January of 2000.
Eight years have passed since HIP '97, to be succeed by WTH '05 this year.
While I don't really need the distraction, I could be convinced to organize
another Cypherpunks, crypto, and security tent. Perhaps the most valuable
lesson I learned at HIP '97 was the value of education. I received
unexpected and invaluable education from two teenagers. I, and the many of
us that made up the Cypherpunks contingent, provided much valuable
educations to others. There exists an entire new generation that wasn't
around in 1997, hungering for education, that could benefit from our
knowledge. If we don't teach them, who will?
If you are interested in joining the "Cypherpunks" tent at WTH during July
28-31 2005, please email me. If there is enough interest, I will organize
another presence.
Sidebar: "Free at last. Oh Lord. We are fee at last" (Also known as the
"Blind Signature Patent Expiration Party")
Some of you may rememember the RSA patent. Yes, there was a time when you
couldn't use RSA inside the U.S. without paying licensing fees to RSA DSI.
Many that were around at that time were not too happy about this fact. But
at least you could pay somebody money to use RSA. If you had a valid
business model, paying licensing fees may have be unpleasant, but using RSA
was not insurmountable.
There is another patent that is every bit as significant as the RSA patent.
More so, perhaps. Unlike the RSA patent, this patent has not been available
for licensing at any price, stymieing an entire field of research and wide
swaths of commerce. This patent is U.S. Patent 4,759,063 "Blind Signature
Systems". The Blind Signature patent is not just any patent. This is *the* patent.
Without the invention covered by this patent, there is no hope for online
privacy. With this technology, the opportunities not just for privacy, but
also for commerce, are endless. Countless visionaries have spent years of
their lives, in some cases decades, trying to make those opportunities a
reality only to run up against the fact that for reasons that would be
worthy of a book, the patent could not be licensed.
U.S. Patent 4,759,063 "Blind Signature Systems" will expire on July 19,
2005. A Tuesday. Since no patent litigator will consider litigating on a
Monday morning over patent infringement for a patent that expires the next
day, it appears safe to say that come the preceding Saturday, technologies
that make use of this patent can be displayed to the public. That Saturday
is July  16, 2005.
It took us 20 long years to get to this date. For those of us that tried to
use this technology, it was 20 very, very long years. Fortunately, the 20
years are over. Which is as much reason for celebration as I can imagine.
The expiration of the Blind Signature patent surely calls for a party. And
as I promised so many years go, I will take it upon myself to throw that
party. Anybody that knows what blind signatures are is welcome, no, make
that implored, to come to the expiration party at my house (or other venue
if there are too many people for my place) to celebrate the expiration of
the patent on Saturday, July 16. As for me, I am counting the days. Ping me

citizens to maintain privacy in the age of the Internet and the patent's
expiration is a much overdue reason for celebration.

@_subject: The Case for Banning Reduced Hop Count Implementations 
I have followed various discussions lately about the creation of reduced
hop Tor clients that implement fewer than the three hops considered by
Tor's design. Such clients represent an attack on Tor as a whole.
Indeed, defenses against reduced hop clients leveraging the Tor network
should be built into Tor's design to defend against this attack.
Today and for the foreseeable future, Tor's network latency relates to
the maximum latency that Tor users are willing to accept. As Tor gets
faster, it attracts more users and more traffic, which in turn increases
latency. As the Tor network increases in latency, it loses users for
whom the latency becomes unacceptably high.
Latency in turn relates to the number of hops. The more hops, the higher
the latency. Which not coincidentally is why some with lower anonymity
requirements may prefer fewer hops. Here is the catch: as traffic from
those with lower anonymity and hop requirements increases, it drives the
latency of three hop connections above the latency acceptable for those
seeking higher anonymity. The end state, if lower than three hop
implementations are permitted to use the Tor network, is that Tor's
network performance will acceptable only to users of lower hop clients.
This fact alone drives a need to block reduced hop clients from the
network. But it gets worse.
Many of those that would be satisfied with fewer hops engage in
comparatively low risk behavior (which is why they are satisfied with
lower anonymity), such as downloading large files of questionable
origin. The protocols commonly used for such downloads can accept higher
latency than the interactive protocols needed by the part of the user
population seeking higher anonymity levels. Pushing the latency of three
hop clients farther out of the usability envelope.
Though the above is more than sufficient cause to block reduced hop
clients from corrupting the Tor network, it deserves mention that single
hop clients in particular remove the protection that Tor's design until
now afforded to exit node operators. If only three hop clients can use
the Tor network, the Tor exit node operator can be confident that
capture of an exit hop's connection log will fail to provide the
attacker with useful tracking information. This discourages both legal
and illegal attacks on Tor exit hops and thus increases the overall
number and capacity of Tor exits.
Removing this protection will lead to an increase in attacks on exit
hops, which in turn will lead to decreased exit capacity. Further
negatively impacting Tor network latency.
In summary, reduced hop clients are deleterious to Tor a whole and users
with the level of anonymity that Tor was design to provide in
particular. Users with lower anonymity needs should be guided towards
the many other systems available today that provide lower anonymity than
Most importantly, Tor should implement a (potentially blinded) hop
verification that ensures that lower hop count clients cannot abuse the
Tor network.

@_subject: Relay flooding, confirmation, HS's, default relay, web of trust 
The Web of Trust (WoT) concept provides for marginal security benefits
and then only in a very narrow set of circumstances that are unlikely to
hold true for the larger community of Tor node operators.
Starting with the second point, the WoT concept presumes that trust
between its members precedes the codification of that trust into
attestations attached to digital certificates.
In other words, the WoT might provide (but likely will not) security
benefits to a group of users that have pre-existing social relations and
trust. For example, members of a human rights group that have personally
known each other, or at least the bulk of each other, for years.
The WoT cannot provide security benefits to a group of users with no
pre-existing social trust relationship, such as the set of "Tor node
operators". The thousands of Tor node operators, a tiny percentage of
which have an existing social relationship, have no inherent trust
amongst each other. And how could they?
Absent an existing real-life WoT, there is no digital WoT to codify.
Even within a group that has a strong existing trust and social graph in
real life, the digital codification of a WoT offers security benefits
only at the extreme margins.
This fact is easiest explained by example:
o Fire up your preferred OpenPGP software. (If you don't have OpenPGP
software, then your understanding of how a WoT works is likely different
from what a WoT actually does).
o Eliminate all public keys for users with whom you do not intend to
communicate. (No communication security system can provide security
benefits to communications that will never take place).
o List the public keys that show as valid. (Meaning they are signed by
one or more keys that you trust to some degree).
o Eliminate all the public keys that are signed by your key. (Those keys
are not authenticated by the WoT, they were authenticated by you directly).
o Eliminate all the public keys that are signed by keys that you chose
to trust because they are the equivalent of CA root keys. This includes
Debian distribution signing keys, the keys of any commercial CA, and the
signing keys of auto-responder key servers such as the PGP Global
Directory. (Signatures performed by such keys do not employ the WoT).
o Look at the small number of public keys remaining. The keys are likely
from deep inside your social circle. Now eliminate all the public keys
that you could trivially authenticate directly, such as by asking a key
holders, who are well known to you, to provide you with their key's
fingerprint at work, at the next security conference, or the next time
you meet at the pub. (The WoT may have authenticated those keys, but the
WoT was not necessary to do so since you could have trivially
authenticated those few keys yourself).
o Lastly, count the remaining public keys. The number will likely be
zero (no real life benefit to the WoT) or close to zero (benefit only in
the extreme margins).
In summary, the WoT is not a suitable solution to increasing the
security of the Tor network.

There are no low-latency anonymizing system designs known to science
today that can protect a user's privacy against a determined, global,
TLA-level adversary. Considerable and by no means unreasonable doubt
exist in the community if such a design is even theoretically possible,
a question for which I refrain from forming an opinion solely due to the
impressive progress science has made over the millennia.
The picture is less clear when it comes to high-latency systems, such as
anonymous remailers. No rational doubt exists in the community that the
systems so far fielded fail to protect against this treat model. But the
question if we know how to design a high-latency system that defends
against the proposed threat model largely remains unanswered. This is in
part due to the fact that the bulk of recent research has focused
primarily on low-latency systems.
That said, it is my belief that if a low-latency system protecting
privacy in the face of TLA-level actors were to be identified, I suspect
the design will be based on PIR, not MIX. It is for this reason that I
encourage high-latency anonymity researchers to focus on PIR designs.

@_subject: [cryptography] Diginotar Lessons Learned (long) 
I can't help but chuckle about Diginotar's very public display of
security incompetence. I mean, who in our line of work can be expected
to keep a straight face when reading gems such as this one taken from
the report by Diginotar's incidence response rapporteur:
"The separation of critical components was not functioning or was not in
place. We have strong indications that the CA-servers, although
physically very securely placed in a tempest proof environment, were
accessible over the network from the management LAN.
The network has been severely breached. All CA servers were members of
one Windows domain, which made it possible to access them all using one
obtained user/password combination".
We are also seeing a near universal call for "fixes" of the broken PKI
paradigm. I couldn't agree more that fixes - and indeed redesigns - are
badly needed and have been for some 15+ years. Pretty much since the day
the word PKI was coined. What I hear much more rarely are discussions if
the proposed fixes actually solve the problem. What I hear hardly ever
are discussions as to which unintended consequences the proposed (and in
some cases already implemented fixes) may bring.
When designing an improvement to a system, it helps to keep in mind the
original requirements the system was intended to address.
In the case of SSL server certs, those requirements roughly were:
- provide Joe Browser user with the ability to connect to a site with
which Joe has no prior relationship while giving Joe sufficient
confidence that the site is who they say they are without MITM for Joe
to part with his credit card number. The public CA infrastructure,
high-profile failures notwithstanding, has done a reasonable job meeting
that requirement.
- shift liability for this authentication from the browser vendors to a
third-party (CA). The current system has done a flawless job at this.
Defenses such as HSTS and cert pinning cannot do better and likely will
do worse, since the browser vendors are getting more actively involved
in the decision which sites to protect with the "best" level of
security. Indeed, security designers and auditors for financial services
firms that fail to demand inclusion of their site in HSTS and cert
pinning lists are arguably falling behind on best practices.
It is not inconceivable that we will see litigation against a browser
vendor initiated by a website that was compromised by a bad cert after
the browser vendor refused to include the website in their HSTS lists.
Note that there is no chance that browser vendors will be willing to
create the infrastructure and build up staffing levels such that all
legitimated websites are protected by in-browser HSFS lists. Yet the
more sites a browser vendor adds to their HSTS or cert pinning lists,
the higher the risk of litigation becomes.
- avoid the server vendor (at the time those requirements were
identified the sever vendor was equal to the browser vendor) from
incurring the costs of having to verify the authenticity of each website
or domain.
The labor cost of adding cert pinning for a domain from a browser
vendor's perspective is identical to that of adding to the browser the
hash of a CA operated by that domain. Which is identical to the cost a
browser vendor would incur authenticating each website. Not going to happen.
At scale, any such list cannot be handled via code updates, but has to
be dynamically provided as a service by the browser vendor. Meaning the
browser vendor becomes isomorphic to a root CA from the perspective of
the users of that browser.
- limit the cost of security to the server operator.
Website and other encrypted service operators are annoyed as it is
obtaining certificates from one CA. It is unreasonable to ask a website
operator to engage in separate dealings with each browser vendor.
Instead, both the website operator and the browser vendors will prefer
dealing with a single entity (or small number) of trusted third parties
(TTP). Such as a public CA.
- no single trusted entity.
Whether you design a security protocol or software counting widgets,
there really is only one of three numbers that your design needs to be
able to accommodate: one, a few, or a great many.
In the public server authentication space, "one" translates to a global
authority issuing credentials. It is not clear who that authority would
be. Presumably the United Nations. What is clear is that national
interests preclude the use of a single global authentication authority.
It is conceivable for each country to have a local authentication
authority, which would require each country to operate some
authentication authority. There is no agreement how many countries exist
on our planet, but the number is somewhere around 200. More than there
are root CAs in the browsers today. Which gets us to the next number: "a
A few represents the status quo. Under the status quo, a few CAs are
issuing certs. Some CAs have a better security track record than others,
though most CAs with an unblemished security record have simply not yet
been attacked, failed to disclose attacks, or don't issue certs to
customers on the Internet at large and therefore can afford to operate
in a purely offline environment. The latter option is not available to
CAs or other services that authenticate a large number of domains.
When operated by national governments rather than global vendors, one
can envision designs in which national CAs issue certificates only for
entities located within the nation's borders. Such designs quickly lead
to a requirement for a global database (see "one" above) or to a
scenario in which Iran's national authority can issue certificates for
gmail.com. Moreover, such a design carries the high risk of leading to a
need for each site to obtain separate certs for each country in which it
operates. That outcome would be welcomed by certain governments, be
perhaps organizationally manageable for a large server operator such as
Google, but be intractable for many other sites. In addition to likely
being detrimental to both the exchange of ideas and security of the
Internet as a whole.
The "a great many" scenario translates to designs in which each browser
reports the certs seen up to a central database, alerting the user if
the cert presented by a server doesn't match (most) of those certs that
were seen by users of the same service. Meaning the browser vendors or
some global entity have to operate a server that more or less logs each
https access. I am not sure how I feel about that. What I do know is
that it creates a whole new attack surface for other types of attacks. I
also believe that for example Tor users, a known target for fake SSL
server certs, would unlikely consider such a design to be an improvement.
Other designs in the "a great many" category log SSL server certs only
locally, alerting the user when a certificate for a particular site
previously visited has changed. I can see value in that features. But we
need to realize that this feature will add to the SSL server cert alert
fatigue users are already experiencing. Time and large field trials will
tell if such a feature is a security net positive. It may increase the
security posture of very security conscious Tor users. It will not solve
the problem for the average Gmail user. Not even for the average Gmail
user in Iran.
- generate recurring revenue
Often mentioned as the primary reason for the existence of CAs,
generating recurring revenue is a driver for significant percentage of
those in the CA business, but as we have seen above the overall number
of entities that derive revenue from issuing certs is quite small. It
is, well, "a few".
The perceived benefits to the issuer are a powerful driver in the client
cert space, where the desire for attribution makes the sum total of
drivers in the SSL server cert space tiny by comparison. But we are not
talking about client certs here. Most CAs do not make a significant
amount money from issuing server certs and the handful of CAs that do
likely would do just as well operating alternative authentication
systems, be that on behalf of a national SSL server cert authority or on
behalf of a browser vendor needing to maintain an HSTS list. The cost
structure is dominated by validation costs at any rate and that holds
true whether the end result is a signed cert or an entry in a browser's
HSTS or cert pinning list.
There are additional requirements that drive the existance of SSL server
certs and public CAs. The requirements I outlined in this post will
suffice to illustrate my point: unless some proposed SSL/CA
replacement/augmentation system will do at least as well at meeting
those requirements as the status quo, the design is unlikely to succeed
in the marketplace. As you are being bombarded with design proposals
promising improvement over the status quo in the next weeks and months -
and are prehaps are working on designs of your own - it will be helpful
to validate those designs against the requirements prior to chosing to
implement the design.
