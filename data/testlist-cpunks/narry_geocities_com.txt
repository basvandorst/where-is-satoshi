Hello, Sorry for any cross-posting.
Just thought this group would be interested in this new s/w.
The most startling thing about it is the price Rs. 1,650. (approx US$
40) per copy ...
I'll be at the Bangalore IT fair morrow, and will try to give a first
hand update of this stuff after meeting with the reps.             Indian firm unveils 448-bit encryption
            package             encryption software package using a powerful 448-bit key,
            developed by an Indian company. It beats the United
States 	    at its
            own game, for, even today, US companies are not allowed to
            export encryption software that uses keys higher than
128             bits.

It's an  implementation of blowfish.
you might get some info at the guy at the fair claimed that it's the strongest existing
implementation of cryptography available in the world to date .. and he
was no "sales" guy - seemed technical enough ... what this s/w seems to be doing is that it gets into ur windows OS,
(works ONLY on windows) and everytime you "save" a file, it captures it,
encrypts it, and stores it .. so nothing on your disc is ever left
ofcourse there must be a lot of such packages in the US .. but the
novelty here, according to this guy was that it was developed outside
the US, and it's price (USD 40) ....
