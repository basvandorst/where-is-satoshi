:near-telephone quality at only 8 k BITs/second?  With a signficant

I am working on this very thing. We will be using LPC encoding for
compression, IDEA for encryption, and DH key exchange for key handling.
We plan to use something better than DH ASAP (something less vulnerable
to man in the middle attacks). We plan to use 14.4kbps transmission

@_subject: Improved DH system. 
I have been told that there is a new improved version of
DH key exchange, which is authenticated. Could
someone give me the reference, and/or tell me what it is
all about?........ Diffie??
I was not clear on what it is that I am working on.
We are trying to build a cheep secure phone
for the masses (read brainless). We are looking for
black box brainless operation. I will provide more
info about the project on request.

@_subject: Improved DH system. 
Well, you seem to have summerised our thoughts on the matter exactly.
We are thinking about sticking a bunch of memory in the phone
and keeping track of the last ,say 100, phones called and the public
keys that they used. One could use the readback to certify the keys.
Some sort of KCA could also be invoked. We are designing the system
for easy upgrade and modification.

@_subject: DES chips. 
I am looking for suppliers of DES chips. I wanted to use an IDEA chip
in the phone I am designing, but the only one made is 177Mbps and costs
about 200SFR. So one possibility is IDEA in software, and the other is
DES (or tripple DES) in hardware. So, if you know name, address, phone,
or email for companies that produce or sell DES chips, please let me know.

The error you mentioned is not my problem. I got the fix when I got PGPTools.
I would really like you to look at the code I am using.
Do you still have access to a Linux box? This communication with you using public groups and lists is a waste of bandwidth,
and very slow. Could you send me an anonymous reply block? It is going to take forever
for you to guess what my problem is without being able to look at the code directly,
and I do not want to post the whole thing to cypherpunks.

Hi all. We discovered that someone has been
running a packet sniffer on our subnet of several
dozen computers. He has all the passwords.
This is my chance to try to get single use password
login programs installed here. Please give me recomendations
and ftp locations.

@_subject: SASE Suggestion 
I have been meditating on this problem of return
addresses, and have a proposal. The remailers
can not be allowed to choose the return path,
as any corrupted remailer will corrupt the rest
of the path. I suggest the following SASE packet
A(foo) = foo encrypted to remailer A
P = some sort of one use postage token.
end is a flag indicating the final destination.
x,y,z,b are large random integers.
n is a large prime.
This will rout reply from A -> B -> C -> Bob
Upon receiving the packet, A does the following:
A decrypts the packet (both parts separately).
A calculates a new b' = b^x mod n and encrypts
So B receives B(P,y,C,C(P,z,Bob,end)),B(b',n,message)
C receives C(P,z,Bob,end),C(b'',n,message)
The message, which would normally be encrypted to Bob,
is never transmitted in the clear. Bob can easily
compute b'' to confirm that the message was correctly
routed, but this reveals no information about the path
the message has taken. The first remailer will refuse
to deliver the message twice, because of the expired
postage token, so the same path will not be reused.
So, what do you think? It does require some work from
the remailers, but not too much more than now.

:As I understand it, the remailers don't "chose" the return path, Bob (the  :sender of the original message) choses the return path when he creates the  :SASE.  All the remailers do is interpret the part of the SASE that becomes  :readable to them after decrypting the SASE portion sent to them from the  :previous hop.  If all is working, what becomes readable is the address of  :the next hop (closer to Bob) and some misc other stuff (postage, maybe,  :and perhaps another encryption key).
:Am I not understanding something correctly?
:Jim_Miller at suite.com
One SASE scheme recently suggested involved sending a request for
a SASE to a ramailer, stating the number of jumps required. It then
sent it to another remailer, and so on. Each adding a layer, and eventually
sending the results to the desired correspondent. I mentioned that if the
first remailer was corrupted, that the whole chain was (it would only send
to other corrupt remailers).

:I'll use Lisp-like notation to encapsulate the sending of a packet to
:a remailer "Bob." If Alice wishes to send a packet to Bob, she creates
:this packet:
:(Bob (more stuff))
:I'm assuming encryption, which several remailers support and which all
:users and all remailers should be using.
:Bob gets this packet, decrypts with his private key and recovers the
:"more stuff." He may discover "more stuff" contains some digital money
:for his troubles, instructions on how much latency (number of
:messages, for example) to use, and where to send the resulting packet.
:All kinds of stuff can fit in here. But that's not the point.
:If Alice wanted to send a message to Zeke, through a bunch of
:remailers, she might create this initial message:
:(Bob (Charles (Doris (Ed (........ (Zeke (final stuff))))....)))
[Lots of stuff removed]

:--Tim May
:-- :Timothy C. May         | Crypto Anarchy: encryption, digital money,  This will not work if Yancy is not trustworthy. She could then send the
message through a chain of compromised remailers, to create the prepaid
mailer packet. This would also happen, though less harmfully, any time the
chain hit a bad node. Letting the nodes choose the other nodes is fatal.

@_subject: Obscura down for a few days. 
Obscura is suffering from HD troubles. The backups have failed so I am going to have to
rebuild it from scratch. This means that the web page and remailer will be down.
All mail to the remailers will be lost. I have changed the name server so
I will still get mail sent to loki at obscura.com.
