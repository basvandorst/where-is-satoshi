OK, so I want to enable the recieving of articles in conjunction with a censorship service.  I guess the way to do this is a sig. of the article number, as this is the most copact way I can think of.  Does anyone have some good ideas for the sig. method?  I was thinking about the government one, so as to render patents moot.  The other problem is coming up with a standard format so that newsreaders(for unix, at least 6, for dos, mac, etc) can be easily modified.  Anyone have some interest in this?

The main problem with this is size and access.  I am actuall talking about a system where there is no moderation, or moderation does not stop the flow of information, but only modifies what you want to look at.  This could also be used as a service to help people pick out usefull technical articles.
You need to be able to get the article lists from ftp, mail, modem, or newsgroup, so that people can pay or not pay.
Basically, this is support for meta-information.

Do you think you might supply a version in the future supporting
1) more session key bits, for user suplied algorithims.
2) larger public keys, with no arbitrary limits.
I would be likely to *BUY* such a program, but will not buy the current version of pgp especially with the restriction on key size.
Don't follow this up with "but it would take a gazilion universes twenty gogelplex years to solve this" as I am fully aware of the numbers, and disagree with 1024 as a reasonable number.
If you don't plan to relax this restriction, then you can expect people in areas where patents are not enforced to hack your algorithim.  Not a threat, or saying it is right, just a fact of life.
Also, as a legal issue, anyone could legaly and without fear of any sanction produce a "modification kit" in printed form that detailed the changes to be made to your code to become "snake oil" and such a modification kit would be protected under the 1st amendment, and totally outside the reach of you or any law enforcement agency.  This might not be "respectfull" to you, but it is totally acceptable, as long as they don't distribute the code for pgp2.6 with it.

I too would be interested in this, but would also wory about the hash functions "converging" to one value.  Unless the function G(i) is one on one, and not a group, this not good.  [G(i): G=H(m;i) i=H(m)] You could loose information in in the G phase of hashing, and shoot yourself in the foot.  What is wrong with the folowing two stratigies.:
let I(key,block) be Idea(key, block)
    N be the number of iterations.
and Si be a non-strong, simple sequence, like from a LCG.
do I(S1,I(s2,i(s3,..........,i(sN,m);
for however many times, then hash it.
2) use a salt value, n. with n%N not equal to 0;
do  {
  m=i(s1,previous m)
 and   n=i(n,previous n)
 } untill (n%N=0)
Number 2 has the added bonus of working with true random numbers for n, so if you wanted to inclose the value of n in some encryption you have no If you keep this to 8 bits or so, you could use feal-4 instead of idea:-)

It depends on the size of the noise.  If the noise could be a simple 4-6char number(compressed name, with pointer to trash adresses or real mismatched ones), giving a 16 char hash and the rest of the information was much larger, say 100chars, a signal to noise of 1 would only be a 15% ish increse in size, and this improves if you have more data.

OK, I have been doing a few numerical experiments on hash functions to see if all this stuff I have been saying is true.  I took the folowing function, as my n bit to n bit hash function.
first n bits(md5(n bits))
and iterated it to see how many colisions there were.  I found that the total entropy in the result typically decresed by 50% for n=8,10,12,14 and droped like a rock when you itterated these.
I have a couple of questions,
1) is this a good hash function, or am I missing something here.
2) the expected collision rate for rand functions is much lower.  I am at a loss to explain md5.
I will be trying smaller versions of all of the suggestions here to see if they help or hurt, and will set them up to run on the spare cycles on a machene or two around here.

Ok, I am kicking myself for saying this, but it is not the data on the tape, it is the information of the machene itself.  It is at most a cardinal infinity, and even if there are irrational numbers there can't be a continum of these.  It has more to do with there being "steps" than what the steps are.  In a continum machene, you would not have steps or states.  It is not clear if the quantization of time could do anything to this(like make it bogus).  The quantization of spacial objects certainly makes a limit forbiding continum tapes.
I was thinking you could get a quantum computer with an continum of states if you did not bind them, which could lead to :
