Yes, and 3-7 day "copies" of popular movies are done on telecine
machines.  Basically, the groups find a friendly movie theater worker,
and they take in a telecine machine after hours and have some one-on-one
time with the film reels.  Telecines copies are quite good.
Real D/D copies don't come out until closer to the dvd release date,
when the first studio-internal dvds are made.. usually months after
release.  Sometimes the studios make early screener dvds for movies,
generally low-budget limited-release movies, and generally toward the
end of the year, the objective (I think) being a shot at the oscars.
