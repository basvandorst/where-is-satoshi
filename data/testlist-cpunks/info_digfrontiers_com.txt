Digital Frontiers Newsletter In the June issue of PC Graphics & Video, HVS optimization stacks up quite favorably against higher-profile (and more expensive) offerings from Adobe, Macromedia, and others. Take a look. By the way - they misprinted the price at $599 for our Toolkit Pro - its actually $208!
