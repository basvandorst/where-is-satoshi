Sourcing Domestic 0il and Gas is Bush�s  priority and, therefore, the Board of Biogenerics
deemed it prudent and appropriate to focus its principa| business in this hotbed of activity.

The Board of Directors took in account the enormous shift to oi| & gas, and acquired Tyche Energy
and formed a joint venture with Hydro Slotter Corporation � an oil and gas techno|ogy |eader.
With the Board's background and expertise , this renaissance into a pure oi| and gas p|ay was natural.
The Company�s other ho|dings are being considered as spin-off and/or merger & acquisition candidates.
Management p|ans to file a Form 10 in the immediate future.
