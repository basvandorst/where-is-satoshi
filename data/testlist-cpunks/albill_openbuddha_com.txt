You realize that there are likely things hidden in the data that can get people killed. I know first hand, from a friend who *did* have their data in the wikileaks dump, that at least one of their informants only escaped being killed after it was unveiled because of family connections in the corrupt little nation they were in. 
I hear a lot of sour grapes and jealousy from a few people of “How dare Greenwald not give *me* access to all this data?!?!"

No, the Pacer thing was previous. He was accessing JSTOR’s archive of (often publicly funded) scholastic research with a crawler of sorts. His main mistake seems to have been not rate limiting his requests, which caused so much traffic that he impinged server functionality and got noticed by the sysadmins for JSTOR, who then blocked access. He kept circumventing the blocks, drawing more attention, until they finally figured out who he was, where he’d put his laptop on their network, and arrested him.

I suggest reading  instead of reinventing the wheel here. All of this has been discussed, ad nauseum, there and a few other forums.
We don’t live in a perfect world and people will always attempt to game the system to make themselves rich. The problem other alt currencies have is why would anyone adopt them when bitcoin is already there and clearly (somewhat) successful? Why mine litecoin, for example, when if I mine bitcoin (or even buy them), I make money for sure (for now at least)?
Reply: David Vorick david.vorick at gmail.com
Right now, bitcoin is almost exclusively speculative. It's worth a lot of money because the value has been increasing consistently. That's tulipmania.
In a perfect world you would have some way to protect a currency against speculation. The volatility in bitcoin makes it less useful as a currency, therefore the speculation is damaging bitcoin.
I don't have a solution, and I'm not suggesting one, I'm merely suggesting that a solution might exist that would be a substantial improvement.
If bitcoin was based on something that had inherent value, say cloud storage, then a spike in value would be followed by a spike in the amount of storage being contributed to the network (bitcoin currently does this, a spike in price is followed by a spike in mining). The key here though is that the network would be protect from dramatic dips in value. When bitcoin drops in price, all of the abundant mining does nothing to save bitcoin, because the bitcoin mining doesn't actually add any value to the network. Nobody cares how many petaflops the network is pulling, because the petaflops can't be put to use somewhere else.
But if the mining was based on cloud storage, a dramatic drop in the price of the currency would result in a dramatic drop in the cost of storing data on the network. That's something that actually has use, and so people would let the price fall unreasonably low (instead they would find a way to make use of the cheap storage). This would allow the currency to ride arbitrary spikes in price while being protected against arbitrary drops in price.
Jim, the amount of mining being done on the bitcoin network has no impact on the price. The price might have an impact on the volume of mining, but because the mining is specific to the bitcoin network (double sha2 hashing or something like that) it can't be sold or used for other applications. Bitcoin mining is only good for bitcoin mining, which means the demand for the mining is exclusively based on value of the bitcoins being mined every day.

Reply: Jim Bell jamesdbell8 at yahoo.com
Oh, non-perceptive one, I seek to enlighten you.  While the payment for bribery normally is thought of as occurring _before_ (or during) the payback desired, as a practical matter it isn't very practical to bribe an American president while he is in office.  But since the office of President will continue to exist, and the people who are inclined to get favors will continue to exist, and they all know this (see 'game theory'),  a logical solution is to delay the bribe payment until the office-holder is out of office.  Obviously, while a president may wonder what would motivate a briber to actually pay the bribe after he leaves office, the reality is (remember reality?) is that word of welshing will surely get back to the subsequent office-holder(s), poisoning the well for the almost-but-not-quite-briber in the future.  No doubt, for example, America's First Muslim President will pick up tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars doing the rubber-chicken circuit in the (Muslim) Middle-east.  Do you wonder why Obama hasn't 'jawboned' the Arab oil producers to drop oil prices to, say, $60 per barrel?  Do you wonder why he hasn't made more threats to open up the spigots of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve?  Or why he hasn't approved the construction of the Keystone oil pipeline?  That's right:  Obama is carrying-water for the very people he expects to be bribed by about 3.5 years hence.

browser rendering that the server would send one canonical page to the 
client, and the client is responsible for rendering?

Only if you wish it was "the good old days" but then this is the list with folks that refuse to run JavaScript and don't understand why anyone would want to use twitter, as I recall.
Well you should say the web developers regressed since then.

SL (or derivatives) would get a lot more users if the tech used didn't

If you recall, I asked you what I should believe in, but you never
