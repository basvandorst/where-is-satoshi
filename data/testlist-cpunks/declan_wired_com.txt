References: I agree that ZKS took a risk by forming in a country that's more hostile to business, and has fewer constitutional safeguards, than the U.S.
But to respond to Bob's point: I'm not sure the Wired article ( we ran on our site implies that anything has changed. If anything, it says that Canadian courts are following the U.S. lead in establishing procedures to "uncloak" email addresses at ISPs.
That's a far cry from saying that businesses like ZKS without the apparent ability to "uncloak" email senders -- pardon the crass simplification -- will be necessarily affected.
