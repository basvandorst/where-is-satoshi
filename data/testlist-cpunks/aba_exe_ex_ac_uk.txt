[Please note mail to me may bounce unless you are very careful with using
addr aba at exe.ex.ac.uk, or aba at atlas.ex.ac.uk, as there are machines out here
due to a physical breakin - a "RAM raid", I tried posting this on Sat, but
the mailer was already out and mail is buffered, so may come out twice]
A break down of Hal's challenge, could someone please check my logic
in deriving an Andrew Roo's style config file for brutessl 1.0 and
check my interpretation against Hal's interpretation in the previous
Hal's previous challenge is indexed from his home page:
I think the challenge file should look like this:
Below I will give my resoning for each field.  Each field as it is
derived will be quoted with >>>
Could a few people check that I have made no mistakes.
Andrew Roos code is on:
as "brutessl.tar.gz", use "save next link as" in netscape (hold shift
key down and click in Netscape 1.1).
Could someone with a PC, and a 32 bit MS Visual C++ compiler handy
compile a PC executable from the tarred files, some people won't have
access to TAR under DOS, and a precompiled binary would be useful.
Please send the binary to Piete if you do this (be sure to turn on all
optimisations).  I tried but my VC++ is not 32 bit, is it possible to
produce 32 bit binaries which can be run from DOS with VC++ at all?  Are the
binaries you get with win 95 / win NT likely to run under DOS ?
The keyserver will not be doling yet but please pickup the software
ready to start.
There is a unix based client, and a windows NT based client both
available from that page.
