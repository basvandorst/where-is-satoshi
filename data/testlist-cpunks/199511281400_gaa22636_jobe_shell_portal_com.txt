This insistence on not making use of authentication tools at the same
time as whining about people spoofing you is what caused me to assume
your identity.  You were given ample warning.
Consider it a demonstration of why you should do just what you are
stubbornly refusing to do: generate yourself a damn key!
It is the best way to ensure a persistent persona whilst retaining
For a purportedly security conscious impostor, you sure are reluctant
to make use of simple authentication tools.  Your risk assesment is
seriously out of whack too.
You do *not* need a secure machine to improve the level of
authentication of your posts: signing your posts would provide better
authentication than no authentication, even if the machine is not
tempest shielded, nor in a secure installation.
Finding your machine (we don't know remember), and installing a kernel
patch to catch your passphrase as it is typed in, or snag it from PGPs
core image is much harder to achieve, even if you are using a multi
user system.
PGP signing your post will give a much better authentication than
people who post from known email addresses; forgeries, and machine
breakins are not that hard to effect.
Oh so you do care about authentication :-)
An offer: you post your own key, and I'll post a revocation.
You might find that people take you more seriously once they know they
are talking to a persistent persona.
