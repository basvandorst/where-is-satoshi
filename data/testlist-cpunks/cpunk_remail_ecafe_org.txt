The recent CryptoLib, offered by the nice folks at AT&T (Written by Jack
Lacy and Don Mitchell), has a small problem: folks without RSA licenses are
given a crippled version without functional RSA code. It sucks, but they must cover their collective asses.
That small problem has now been rectified.  Is CryptoLib available overseas yet?

This is simply untrue. Read the fine print in the file. Use this code
and you owe them big. They'll "reach out and touch" you big time.
If they were serious, they'd gpl it.
I don't understand why this group continues to tolerate these blatently
commercial messages from att (and netscape.) (The message is
really just an ad for the cryptolib product, as it says). I've also said
this b4 but I'll say it again: why would anyone in their right mind trust
binary code from att after the clipper fiasco.
And why do we tolerate Jeff Weinstein and Mat Blaze calling themselves
cypherpunks, when they are so clearly just working us for their
corporate interests? I wonder how much they get paid to monitor this

I'm not trying to start a flame war. I'm
sure these people are very smart and have
written lots of good code. I'm sure they're
very nice and never kick their dogs.  I'm
just tired of people defending them as
They aren't cypherpunks.
Neither has come out against GAK. They
both carefully avoid commiting to any
statement. They want us to think they're
"one of us" but they don't want to be
pinned down because they are double dipping
on both sides of the fence.
Blaze even does "research" on GAK. See
his web page for evidence. Also the TIS
report. The fact that he found a bug in
clipper doesn't change this. It proves
it.  He works for the government, via att.
Weinstein is actively promoting GAK by
working at the company that the government
has chosen to bring it to you now that
att has failed.
WHY IS EVERYONE SO QUICK TO DEFEND THESE
PEOPLE? DO THEY HAVE YOU ALL SO IMPRESSED
WITH THEIR MASTERS DEGREES THAT YOUR AFRAID
TO LOOK CLOSELY?
No, I did not post the RSA patch. I wouldn't
touch any of that code with a 5 meter pole.
To the guy who says write code: I've
written plenty of code. Clue: your probably
running some of it right now.
I'm anonymous because I've seen FIRST HAND
what the att lawyers do to people who
tell the wrong kind of truth.
Want me to be a 'nym. OK.

I'm not trying to start a flame war, just telling
people what's REALLY happening.
ATT and Netscape are both tools of the CIA/NSA.
Blaze and Weinstein are in on the
plot to force GAK upon us.  Neither one
says enough about the evils of GAK on their
web page, so they're obviously for GAK and
only pretending to be against it to fool
the cypherpunks and curry favor with their NSA
Evidently the cypherpunks are all too impressed
with Blaze and Weinstein's master degrees to see
what's really happening.  Only true visionaries
like myself and Dr. Frederic B Cohen are telling
it like it is; everyone else has had the wool
pulled over their eyes by the NSA/ATT/Netscape axis.
It's amazing how clear everything becomes once
one stops taking the medication that THEY prescribed.

I was not interested in starting a flame but
I seem to have ignited one. I'm sorry about that.
Since almost nobody sees these people from big
corps as having a conflict of interest by being here
I am willing to drop the subject having raised
the point. It just seemed funny to me that
cypherPUNKS would be so happy to have these
fortune 500 types running the show. I guess
I see the point that these people have something
to contribute as long as they are honest about who
they are. I have to say it rubs me wrong though.
Like I said I've written a lot of code in my day
and many of you are probably running some of it
while you read this (enough said).
I just don't want to depend on att or
netscape to protect me. Even if they
do a good job the cost of using their
stuff is too high (for example the
fine print in that att product).
Lets write our own code and gpl it
so no one can take it away!

Windows 95 Is A Hacker's Dream Over The Internet
Central, Hong Kong, Nov 9 (NB) -- Windows 95, combined
with the Internet, could be a dream made in hacker
heaven. From seasoned propeller heads Newsbytes has
contacted, it looks like Windows 95 could be more of
a security nightmare than was first thought.
This is especially true where fixed link companies are
concerned. An investigation of the new operating system,
when hooked onto the Internet, leaves computers wide
open. Executing a series of simple, uncomplicated
commands opens up company and private users' computers to
hacking the moment they access the Internet, claim some
Worse, they may never know it has been done. Using a
simple Unix command, a hacker can locate the IP (Internet
protocol) address of the subscriber logged into an
Internet service provider. Then he needs only one more
thing; a logged-on Internet user using Microsoft's new
operating system.
For businesses with leased line Internet links, it can
happen at any time, day or night. Once the IP address has
been noted, the hacker simply creates a file through DOS
on his own system, specifying the address and naming it.
Using two other commands -- which purge the remote names
on the IP, or Internet provider's port -- the system then
refreshes and remaps itself in preparation to be accessed
by the hacker's computer.
Because Windows 95 is designed with a networking
capability, it leaves all computers in the office open to
illegal access. Once the hacker has called up his Map
Network Drive, the hard disk on his own machine cannot be
differentiated from that of the genuine user. All that
need be done then is to put in a common drive name, most
obviously "C:\." For networked machines, the default "C$"
is common.
This gives access to all files on the subscriber's drive.
While Windows 95 allows the user to protect the drive by
giving it a password, computer experts Newsbytes talked
to said that device won't necessarily lock out intruders.
Because the operating system has no "audit" trail -- in
other words, it does not log who or how someone is
accessing the drive -- a hacker can spend weeks trying to
discover the password. Password search programs, like
Cracker, are readily available and can break through most
simple password sequences.

Pentagon Spy Agency Bares Some Dusty Secret Papers
By Tim Weiner
Washington, April 4 -- The National Security Agency, the
Pentagon spy service that eavesdrops on global
communications, said today that it had declassified more
than 1.3 million pages of secret documents, some from
before World War I.
All the declassified material is more than 50 years old,
older than the agency itself, and represents a tiny
fragment of the billions of pages of Government documents
that have been kept secret on the grounds that their
release would damage national security. Agency officials
were at a loss to explain why these documents, now at the
National Archives, had remained secret for so long.
Among the documents declassified today is a January 1919
memorandum from CoL A. W. Bloor of the Army, a commander
in the American Expeditionary Force in France, explaining
the origin of the "code talkers," American Indian
soldiers who spoke in their native tongues to confound
enemy code breakers in World War I and World War II.
Their languages were largely unwritten and largely
unstudied by foreigners, and so constituted an instant
code translatable only by the speakers.
"The German was a past master at the art of 'Listening
In,' " on radio transmissions, the memorandum says. "It
was therefore necessary to code every message of
importance and coding and decoding took valuable time."
Then, Colonel Bloor wrote, he remembered that he had a
company of Indians in his regiment who among them spoke
26 languages or dialects, and that "there was hardly a
chance in a million" that the Germans could translate
David Hatch, the National Security Agency's historian,
said Choctaws, Navajos, Comanches, Winnebagos, Pawnees,
Kiowas and Cherokees served as code talkers. In World War
II, he said, the Marine Corps used more than 400 Navajos
as communicators in the Pacific campaign. That story has
been popularized by Hollywood films, documentaries and
Mr. Hatch said he could not explain why the documents
stayed secret for so long. The agency's archives run into
the billions of pages, and the agency, loath to disclose
anything concerning codes, has only begun to consider
declassifying documents in the past four years.
"We have so many pages and we've only been at it for a
few years," Mr. Hatch said. "The interesting thing to me
is that this is coming out. What was known only to
insiders is now becoming known to historians and

Secret Cables of '43 And the Hiss Case
May I offer a distinction that may clarify a point in
Eric Breindel's March 14 editorial-page piece "New
Evidence in the Hiss Case?"
The matter deals with the newly released Soviet cables
dated from 1943 to the early Cold War, and intercepted
and solved by the National Security Agency and its
predecessors in a project called Venona. As Mr. Breindel
states, "The single most interesting document in the new
Venona batch is a March 30,1945, Washington-to-Moscow
report on an agent whose cover name was 'Ales.' The cable
was decrypted on Aug. 8, 1969, and the NSA glossary ...
explains that 'Ales' is 'probably Alger Hiss.' "
A distinction must be made between the test of the cables
and the identification of the individuals mentioned in
the text only by code name. The cables were
cryptanalyzed. The internal cross-checks in this work
make the likelihood of their being incorrectly solved all
but zero. This means that the code names are almost
certainly right. But the determination that a particular
code name represents a particular individual did not come
from cryptanalysis. It came from FBI field
investigations. I have no reason to question their
accuracy, but they stand on a different basis than
codebreaking. This is why NSA qualified the Ales=Hiss
identification with a "probably."

Private Groups Lead Charge in War on Far Right
By Michael Janofsky
Washington. In the year since the worst terrorist act on
American soil, the bombing of a Federal building in Oklahoma
City that killed 168 people, the number of right-wing groups
harboring anti-government sentiments has been estimated at
mnre than 800, by some counts, and they now operate in every
These are organized groups of militias, white supremacists,
neo-Nazis- skinheads, survivalists and constitutionalists who
are connected to each other with increasing frequency by the
Internet, fax machines and a shared belief in Christian
Identity, a renegade religious concept that. proclaims whites
to be God's chosen people, Jews to be descendants of Satan and
blacks to be subhuman.
At the same time, however, as Federal agencies proceed with
traditional means of intelligence gathering (as in the
Unabomber case), and Congress ponders a new anti-terrorism
bill (stalled by the gun lobby and civil libertarians),
efforts to fight domestic terrorism are being supplemented
more than ever by private human rights organizations that
track the fringe right with their own networks. They willingly
share information with law enforcement agencies, branches of
the military and reporters.
Federal law enforcement agencies, which were heavily
criticized for their actions in fatal controntations in Ruby
Ridge, Idaho, and Waco, Tex., appear to be trying a new, more
patient approach in waiting for a peaceful solution to the
current standoff with the anti-government group called the
Freemen in eastern Montana. They have been criticized this
time, largely by neighbors of the Freeman and local officials,
for waiting so long to get involved, and for waiting at all.
Undercover Work
Most of the human rights organizations were actively
campaigning against racism and anti-Semitism long before the
Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995 and the arrest of two
suspects with links to militia groups. And with many of the
right-wing groups now hiding racist views beyond a more
acceptable veneer of anti-government oratory, the human rights
groups say the need to collect information has become that
much more critical.
At least two of them -- the Southern Poverty Law Center in
Montgomery, Ala., and the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los
Angeles -- use undercover operatives. Both organizations had
spies attend a convention last weekend in Lake Tahoe that
attracted hundreds of Christian Identity followers to hear a
speech by Randy Weaver, the white separatist whose wife and
son were killed three years ago in a siege by Federal agents
in Ruby Ridge.
The Southern Poverty Law Center has computer files of more
than 12,000 people identified as members of a far-right group.
The Wiesenthal Center operates an extensive electronic
tracking station, where researchers monitor television, cable
and radio shows all over the world for racist and anti-Semitic
When the Army recently conducted an internal investigation to
learn how many soldiers were involved with skinhead groups,
senior officers at the Pentagon twice conferred with
Wiesenthal Center officials, and when Patrick J. Buchanan was
running for the Republican Presidential nomination, they
produced names of Buchanan supporters who once worked for
David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan member, or had affiliation
with the National Association for the Advancement of White
Law enforcement agencies have credited the human rights groups
with helping the public become more aware of the beliefs,
factions and heroes of the far-right fringe. The human rights
groups see their efforts as a necessary antidote to the
sympathetic treatment of far-right groups on conservative talk
radio programs, and to the reluctance of some conservative
politicians to criticize the extremists. But the work may have
also produced some unintended consequences.
Writing in The Jubilee, a publication of the Christian
Identity movement, a former militia leader from Alabama, Jeff
Randall, said the drumbeat of concern over domestic terrorism
has served as a welcome recruiting device for militias and
other right-wing groups.
"Throughout all this," he wrote, "the militias became stronger
and better organized.
"Many people are wondering if the militia movement is still
alive and well," he added. "The answer to that question is a
resounding 'yes.' "

posed by the antigovernment "Patriot" movement. In an April 9,
1996 letter, Dees urged Reno to take concrete steps to counter
the threat of further domestic terrorism. He also provided her
with a copy of *False Patriots*, the Center's new report on
the "Patriot" movement. This 72-page expose is the culmination
of a Center investigation into the "Patriot" movement
conducted since the Oklahoma City bombing.
United By Hate
The "Patriot" movement encompasses numerous elements of the
American right, from certain Christian fundamentalists to the
Ku Klux Klan. It includes tax protesters, survivalists and
neo-Nazis, as well as radical anti-environmentalists and gun
enthusiasts. The tie that binds those in the movement,
estimated by some at five million strong, is a virulent hatred
of the federal government.
This hatred has been fueled in recent years by the passage of
gun control legislation, the deaths of Randy Weaver's wife and
son at the hands of federal agents on Ruby Ridge in Idaho, and
the disastrous federal assault on the Branch Davidian compound
in Waco.
The False Patriots report reveals the people behind the
"Patriot" movement, people like Louis Beam, a key Aryan
Nations leader, and Pete Peters, a pastor of the bizarre
Christian Identity faith. It identifies over 800
antigovernment "Patriot" organizations, including 441
unauthorized militia groups. It describes how "Patriot"
paramilitary units are preparing for war with the federal
government. It offers an inside look at guerrilla literature
and the tools of terrorism. It documents crimes linked to the
"Patriot" movement, including plots to blow up other federal
buildings. It demonstrates that the "Patriot" movement poses
"a clear and present danger" to the nation.
Expect More Bombs
Immediately after the Oklahoma City disaster, a spokesperson
for the Militia of Montana predicted more antigovernment
violence. "Patriot" groups flooded the underground book market
and the Internet with manuals on bomb-making, railroad
sabotage and the production of deadly chemicals. "Patriot"
leaders openly suggested the need to kill government
Since the Oklahoma City tragedy, numerous "Patriot" terrorist
plots have been discovered, including plans to poison federal
employees in Minnesota and conspiracies to blow up a federal
courthouse in Spokane and an IRS building in Reno. An AmTrak
train was derailed by a group calling itself "Sons of the
Over ten tons of explosives have been stolen from various
locations around the country in the past year. Authorities

produced 130 grams of the deadly poison ricin, enough to kill

You can take a number of steps to fight against domestic
+ Contact your state attorney general's office
Find out if your state has anti-militia and anti-paramilitary
training statutes. If the answer is "Yes," insist that the
laws be enforced. If "No," urge the attorney general's office
to work for passage of such laws.
+ Support federal legislation to outlaw militia groups that
are not authorized by state law
These groups operate as a springboard for dangerous
antigovernment activity.
+ Learn about the "Patriot" movement and share your knowledge
with others
The "Patriot" movement thrives on secrecy and citizen apathy.
The *False Patriots* report offers the most complete way for
concerned individuals to learn the full story of the "Patriot"
movement. It was created by the Militia Task Force, a project
of the Southern Poverty Law Center, and is available to those
who support the Center's work with a tax-decutible gift of $15
or more.
The Militia Task Force is leading the fight to expose the
"Patriot" movement and protect those injured in hate crimes.
The Center's Militia Task Force and its Klanwatch Project
monitor "Patriot" groups, especially those with racist ties.
Computerized investigative files contain over 11,000 photos
and videos as well as data on 3,200 groups, 14,000 individuals
and over 61,000 incidents. A quarterly "Intelligence Report"
is provided free to law enforcement agencies and the media.
This work has not been done without costs. In 1983, the
Center's Montgomery, Alabama, offices were burned by the Klan.
Its lawyers have received serious death threats. Just this
past November, three members of the Oklahoma Constituional
Militia were arrested in a plot to bomb the Center's offices.

INTELLIGENCE N. 269, 24 July 1995 (Vol. 16, N. 15) Publishing since 1980 Editor Olivier Schmidt Intelligence, N. 269, 24 July 1995, p. 11 RONALD K. NOBLE - U.S.A. This time the U.S. Treasury Department hasn't jumped the gun in announcing that Ronald K. Noble, the hard-line Undersecretary for Enforcement at Treasury, was the new chairman of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) set up in Paris by the G-7 group of industrialized nations in 1988.  Last year at this time, the Netherlands took over the chair but U.S. Treasury wrongly issued an announcement that Noble was occupying the post.  Asked by "Intelligence" for an explanation, Treasury simply stated that it had "made a mistake."  Last year in Washington, Noble backed bankers complaining about the several million Currency Transaction Reports (CTR) they were required to file every year.  Noble and the banks said that filing was not necessary on deposits by businesses like department, grocery and convenience stores that routinely make fluctuating large deposits in cash, and Treasury intended to slash CTR filings by 30 percent.  Critics contend that businesses exempt from CTR filing will quickly be used by criminal organizations to launder their cash. As Undersecretary for Enforcement at Treasury, Noble oversees five of the eight largest federal law enforcement agencies in the U.S.:  the Secret Service, U.S. Customs, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), and the IRS Criminal Investigation Division, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) which was taken over by Treasury's Office of Financial Enforcement under Noble last year at this time.  At the FATF, Noble replaced Leo Verwoerd of the Netherlands on 1 July 1995 and will direct the FATF for one year.  Following last year's resolution to "monitor implementation of the forty Recommendations of 1990 by its members," Noble intends to use forceful methods including open criticism in annual FATF reports of non-complying members, followed by written reprimands from the FATF chairman to recidivist member countries, and finally high-level mission visits to the faulty country.  Greece has already been criticized twice for its lack of progress in implementing FATF recommendations.  .

@_subject: IPG cracked with known plaintext 
This information is preliminary and is based on an attempt to
understand the IPG algorithm information.  That description is not
clear in some areas, however, hence this analysis is tentative at this
First let us describe the IPG system in more conventional C:
a[0] to a[63] are initialized to random 8-bit values.  (The
description is unclear and almost makes it sound like they are
initialized to a random 8-bit value anded with 0x3500, which would of
course be zero.  The attack below will assume that this bizarre step
is not done, but will still apply even if it is.)
b[0] to b[63] are initialized to random primes selected from some
pool.  c[0] to c[63] are also initialized to random primes selected
from a different pool.
d is initialized to a random 8 bit value.
The algorithm is:
    for ( ; ; ) {
    }
Note first that with a known plaintext attack, the value of d can be
calculated for each iteration, simply by xor'ing the plaintext and
ciphertext.  So we can easily recover a series of d values under this
assumption.  Known plaintext is a plausible cryptographic assumption
in many contexts.
Note second that we can assume that b[i] is less than c[i].  It
appears from the description that this will be true, although it is a
little unclear.  If b[i] is greater than c[i] then simply do
b[i] = b[i] % c[i] before beginning the loop.  This will produce the
same results since (a + (b mod c)) mod c is equal to (a + b) mod c.
Note third that when a[i] and b[i], both less than c[i], are added mod
c[i], the result will be equal to one of two things: a[i]+b[i], or
a[i]+b[i]-c[i].  The reason is that the sum a[i]+b[i] must be less
than 2*c[i] so the "mod" operation will be at most a single
subtraction of c[i].  In general, half the time it will be necessary
to subtract c[i], and half the time it will not.
Now, as mentioned above, with known plaintext we can deduce the series
of d values.  Since each d differs from its predecessor by adding
a[i], this allows us to calculate the low 8 bits of a[i] simply by
taking the difference between successive d's.
Every 64 bytes, i repeats.  We know the low byte of a[i] from the
previous iteration, and we know it for this iteration.  Half of the
time (on average) a[i] will change simply by adding b[i], in which
case the low 8 bits will change by exactly the low 8 bits of b[i].  So
if we take the difference between a[i] values spaced 64 bytes apart,
half of the time these values will be a constant which is equal to the
low byte of b[i].
The other half the time, the low 8 bits will change by adding b[i] and
subtracting c[i].  So the low 8 bits of (b[i]-c[i]) is the other
possible constant value which will be seen when you take the
difference of a[i] every 64 bytes.
So with a few multiples of 64 bytes of known plaintext, you will
quickly find all the possible b[i] and b[i]-c[i] low bytes. By itself
this should significantly narrow down the possibilities for b[i] and
c[i], in many cases to a single prime.  Even without this the
algorithm can now be run forward or backward with only two possible
known changes to a[i] at each step, and the entire message can be
easily deduced.
So this algorithm is easily broken with known plaintext.

I noticed that Sun's latest libc patch (101759-04) is empty.  Previous
versions contained the complete U.S. version of libc, including the
tres-dangerous DES and crypt functions.  In the current rev only the

        must be obtained by the user of this patch.

Yup, that's right.  The syslog hole that was so well publicized by

for Sun to distribute the fix!
So did HP and Sun spontaneously, simultaneously develop crypto awareness,
or is some gummint dweeb whispering threats in their ear?

Spy in the copier gave CIA its coup
by James Adams Washington
A tiny camera hidden in a photocopier in the Soviet
embassy in Washington provided America with one of the
greatest intelligence coups of the cold war, it emerged
last week.
The camera, planted by the CIA in the early 1960s,
provided a treasure trove of intelligence, with access to
virtually every document copied by the Russians for most
of the decade.
The CIA was exploiting a Russian bureaucratic obsession
with documents: in 1963, word got out that embassy staff
were fed up with copying documents by hand and had
approached Xerox to rent a photocopier. American spies
went to work.
Ray Zoppoth, one of Xerox's engineering experts, hit upon
the idea of installing a camera opposite the
photocopier's mirror. It was activated automatically when
the document scanning light came on.
The coup could hardly have come at a better time for the
CIA. The Cuban missile crisis had plunged American-Soviet
relations into one of their darkest periods. The CIA,
embarrassed over the way the Soviets had been able to
move missiles into Cuba, was determined to improve its
intelligence capability.
One problem was how to retrieve the camera's film at
regular intervals. Xerox prided itself on the reliability
of its early machines but it sent a maintenance man
regularly to the embassy to collect the film.
Later Zoppoth invented an even smaller camera that could
be disguised as a tool. Over the next six years the
camera was installed in photocopiers at other embassies
of hostile and friendly countries. "Xerox copiers had
become part of every office system and no foreign embassy
was immune to possible spying," said Zoppoth.
The operation was halted only in 1969, when an American
chemical company tried to bug the photocopier of a rival
firm to steal patented designs. The publicity surrounding
the case alerted the Russians and they stopped
photocopying their secret documents.
