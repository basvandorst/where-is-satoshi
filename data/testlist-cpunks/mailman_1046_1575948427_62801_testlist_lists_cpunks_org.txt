@_subject: New Technique Could Trace Documents By Printer

   from the better-than-a-notch-in-the-e dept.
   An anonymous reader submits "From [1]this article at Purdue News,
   'Researchers at Purdue University have developed a method that will
   enable authorities to trace documents to specific printers, a
   technique law-enforcement agencies could use to investigate
   counterfeiting, forgeries and homeland security matters.' The neat
   thing is that they are exploiting the characteristics of the print
   process itself to identify the printer." One of the folks e-mailed me
   to say that [2]the HP LaserJet 9000dn was one of the big ones tested
   with.
