Okay. I have compiled a list of people interested in the shirt...If you are not on the list, and are interested, mail me.
As for a design, we have a design we are working with, available (a rough
draft) via anon ftp. If you have a better idea, or would like to take a crack at designing it, let me know and we can put these designs up as well. A sort of "vote for the best design". Also, Jef Poskanzer (jef at netcom.com) has given us permission to use his DOT crypto warning sign, if someone would like to incorporate that into thier idea. We will be finishing up our design over the next week, and working cost, sizes, etc. I'll keep you posted.

Has anyone considered forwarding and/or send NPR an information packet to
help bring the encryption/clipper issues to the general public, or is that
looked upon as a bad idea?

They do have a mail address via AOL, and IMHO are not biased towards anything
except the left wing. Getting them to discuss the Clipper/Crypto issue on the
science program could help get it out in the open in a positive manner,
rather than waiting for someone to have his equipment/life seized, or some
other such thing making it's way into the mainstream, and thus causing the
general public to be biased towards the government (which is what we don't

I found the following on Usenet, and was curious as to the validity of the

please post or mail it private. I don't know if any of it already floated
through here, but thought you might be interested in it.

  From:    "Alan (Gesture Man) Wexelblat"   Subject: DES is a dead dog...
    From: Philip Zimmermann     Subject: Re: DES Key Search Paper (fwd)
    Michael Weiner presented a paper at Crypto93 that describes a fast
    DES key search engine that uses a special inside-out DES chip that
    he designed.  This chip takes a single plaintext/ciphertext pair
    and quickly tries DES keys until it finds one that produces the
    given ciphertext from the given plaintext.  Weiner can get these
    chips made for $10.50 each in quantity, and can build a special
    machine with 57000 of these chips for $1 million.  This machine can
    exhaust the DES key space in 7 hours, finding a key in 3.5 hours on
    the average.  He works for Bell Northern Research in Ottawa, and
    says they have not actually built this machine, but he has the chip
    fully designed and ready for fabrication.
    This is a stunning breakthrough in the realization of practical DES
    cracking.  BTW-- note that PEM uses straight 56-bit DES.

Most of the shirts have shipped, with the exception of orders containing sizes over XXL. There was a probably with the larger sizes, which has been resolved. Those orders (the last remaining) will be shipped out sometime this week.
I apologize for any delays, and the time it took to get this together. It turned out to be a bigger project than originally anticipated. It's too bad I can script a packaging algorithm to handle this, but that's real-life for you. :)

If enough people are interested, we will be doing another run sometime in the next month or so. I will keep you updated. Until then, PLEASE, do not send me checks or orders.

This is also the last call for orders. We will be taking orders until the 15th of February, so if you want one, send it ASAP. We will not be re-pressing the shirts, it is a one-time deal.

"Cypherpunk Criminal" T-shirt Ordering Information
Part I: Where to get a preview of the design
The front of the t-shirt can be obtained via anonymous FTP at netcom.com in
pub/cvoid/cypherpunks. The filename is "front.gif" which is based on Jef
Poskanzer's "CRYPTO-DATA" DOT warning logo (this file is available as well
as "logo.gif"). The back of the t-shirt consists of the upper banner,
"cypherpunks at toad.com", and the lower banner, "There is safety in large
numbers". In the middle is a listing of 7-digit primes in a large block. The
typestyle is Fusion and Fusion bold. Outputting this to a GIF is next to
impossible due to the resolution needed to reproduce the text. Trust us,
it's cool.
Part II: What kind of t-shirt is it? What color? Sizes? Custom? Availability?
The t-shirts are Hanes Beefy-T's, which are a very strong and durable. The
t-shirts will be black, with white and yellow screened on to it. We were
unable to come up with a practical way to customize the t-shirts on an
individual or group basis, so we opted for this design instead. We will
only be making as many as we get orders for, and have no plans to do a second
printing. Sizes available are S, M, L, and XL. We may be able to get XXL, XXXL
and XS shirts as well. We will post an update in regards to the additional
sizes. Part III: How much do they cost? Ordering deadline?
The t-shirts will cost $10 each, which will include shipping and handling to
anywhere you want them sent (except Mars). We will be accepting orders until
February 15th. The t-shirts will be shipped out before February 28th.
Part IV: Ordering Information
Please make all Money Orders out to "Inky Fingers" (the screening company we
use). Please specify the number of t-shirts, and what size you need, and where you want them shipped. We cannot (for obvious reasons) accept personal checks. Cashier's Checks and Money Orders only, please. Orders can be mailed to:

The few people that still have outstanding orders:
I am resolving problems with the screening company and a certain size of shirt. I have received numerous promises from them that I would get the last of the shirts "by the end of the week". This has been going on for months, and is starting to sannoy me as well. There are as of now, only 5 orders that have not shipped, and this is the reason why.
The shirts WILL BE SHIPPED. I have no control over the screening company, and have an order placed with another company which I may have do the small lot of shirts that have not shipped.
I apologize to those of you who have waited, as this reflects moreso on me than anyone else.
