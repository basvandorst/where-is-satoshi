I kinda dig the level of detail in Twitter's blog post today on their
new 2FA system. Not really qualified to analyze said details, but
certainly they're not going for the obscurity approach.

IIRC Google happened to run across it, and they spend a lot of time
(and money) trying to detect bad ads, but it's certainly not
foolproof. The arms race continues. There are many areas where we
can't really consider Google one of the "good guys" (insofar as that
label means anything), but fighting malware is an area where they
certainly seem to be on the side of good.

Keep in mind that not all law enforcement (or the broader class of
potential adversaries) will have access to NSA/FBI-type capabilities
or even NSLs and such, not to mention that it provides additional
protection in case a Google server is breached. Having spent time
chatting with some of their security people, including members of
their incident response team, I'm not so cynical that they view
anything like this as a reason not to secure their stuff. I find it
far more likely that they see this as adding an additional hurdle for
adversaries to clear.

So how do you propose that a provider perform SSL without keeping
their private cert? And how should they respond when a court *orders*
them to allow law enforcement or other agencies to install sniffers on
their network? That's essentially what Lavabit faced.
Also: it's easy to accuse someone of lacking guts or imagination, but
I don't think any of these folks are shutting down services and even
businesses without serious consideration of the costs involved -
financial and otherwise.

I look forward to reading that paper.
Though re: traffic analysis, if your traffic stands out too much (i.e.
for relatively low n on a global scale), then you'll still have
issues[0]. And the devil's in the details, as Tom Ritter's fine work
around AAM[1] has shown.

The journalists (like Barton Gellman) working on the releases have
specifically stated that Snowden's not doing this. According to
Gellman[0], Snowden passed them the docs with fairly minimal
instructions ("select for news and avoid damage"). One could certainly
disbelieve Gellman, but there's the assertion nonetheless.

Feels like naming coincidence, particularly given that the GCHQ
analogue is named similarly. From The Guardian[0]:
"The NSA's codeword for its decryption program, Bullrun, is taken from
a major battle of the American civil war. Its British counterpart,
Edgehill, is named after the first major engagement of the English
civil war, more than 200 years earlier."

I also suspect they're doing some level of malware screening. If so,
it didn't work too well here - not that this is malware (the author of
the original service that created these docs is a personal friend) but
it has a lot of similar code / functionality.
