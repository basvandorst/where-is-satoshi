Shortly afterwards the plane would have slammed into the ground because some idiot fired a gun on a plane. What's more, if everyone's free to bring weapons onto the plane I can see the terrorists carrying some pretty big guns themselves. Fuck it, why not make everyone carry explosives so they can blow themselves and everyone in the vicinity away if there's a crime going on nearby.

What would actually happen is that in order to commit an act of suicidal terrorism all you'd have to do is stand up and rely on the other passengers to shoot up the plane for you. It's a great stratagy, requires almost no effort and no weapons. I everyone in the Us had that kind of attitude and a handgun how many innocents would hav been killed for looking suspicious so far?
