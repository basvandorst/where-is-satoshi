======= Unpack this message with pgp -p ======
Remailer for Waffle 1.4 - Cyph3rpunx wr1t3 k0d3!
Version 1.4
- Cleaned up code (a bit)
- Added anonymous id database ('penet') functions
- Newsgroups that are not in the usenet file are added to it
- Wiping of plaintext PGP output files works now
  (file was open for reading only)
- Do not write EOF (FF) anymore when appending files
- Added "Organization:" field
- Added "Reply-To:" field
- Added "X-Remailer-Software:" field
- Added "Remailed by: "  header field
- Added -v (verbose) argument
- Added some error handling :)
- Added -penet argument. If given, remail allocates anymous ID's.
  If not, remail works as a standard cypherpunx remailer.
In the next version I will add acknowledgement of allocation of
anon ID, ping, help, passwd.
Please let me know if you have any suggestions.
Please test my remailers:
    anon at desert.hacktic.nl          Penet style
    remail at desert.hacktic.nl        Cypherpunx style
Another experimental remailer is
    anon at vox.hacktic.nl
