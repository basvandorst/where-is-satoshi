@_subject: anonymous age credentials, sharing of 
Transfer of credentials is a big problem in terms of computer based Authentication is traditionally carried out in one of three forms:
*	Authentication by knowledge(passwords)
*	Authentication by posession(key cards)
*	Authentication by being(biometrics)
With the first two, which are overwhelmingly popular and cheap, the transfer of credentials is trivial.
Even if they're not anonymous credentials, the fact that I can hand someone my driver's licence to swipe through a card reader next to a machine is a simple example of transfer of credentials problem.
