It's the former (in SSL v2.0).
I looked into this, because the former version can be vulnerable to
related-key attacks, if not done right.  SSL v2.0 does it right.
(In particular, SSL v2.0 hashes both the 88 bit salt + 40 bit secret
to get all the cipher keys.)
(And you'd have to change the cipher type from RC4-40 to RC4-128.)
Or write a local proxy to convert from RC4-40-salted to RC4-128.

@_subject: [ecash] Re: Multi-issuer questions 
I have to admit I don't know the ecash concepts well enough to respond
very intelligently to everything you talked about, though I'd like to
address one of your comments on inter-bank clearing.
I wanted to bring up one misconception: you mention that the main worth
of ecash is measured by whether merchants will accept it as payment,
and that whether a bank will accept it as a deposit is just a secondary
issue.  From this you conclude that so long as a merchant can validate
ecash (via online clearing, to detect double-spending), it doesn't really
matter whether that merchant's bank will accept the ecash -- just that
other merchants will accept the ecash.  This is brought up in the context
of "what if Bank B didn't accept [deposits of] ecash from Bank A?".
I claim that this is at best misleading, because with Digicash's ecash,
when a merchant receives ecash as payment, the ecash is "made out" to
that particular merchant, and is non-transferable-- i.e. can't be
used as payment to another merchant.  When you've been payed Digicash
ecash, about the only interesting thing you can do is deposit it with
your bank.
[ For simplicity, I'm ignoring wildcards in the "pay to" field; but
wildcards are insecure on their own.  Digicash hasn't really attempted
to support wildcards or transferable ecash in general, as far as I
can tell.  Correct me if I'm wrong. ]

Ok.  Fair enough.  Good points.
Personally, what I found most distasteful about FV's post was their
conclusions, not their experimental procedure.
I agree that their keyboard-sniffer lends more evidence to the well-known
argument that, to make good use of crypto, you need secure endpoint machines.
I disagree when FV concludes that this makes crypto useless.  Instead, I'd
contend we just need to work to secure our endpoints better; then we can do
all sorts of neat stuff with crypto.
I found their conclusions to be academically displeasing.  But I guess
that's what happens when you're trying to sell a product...
