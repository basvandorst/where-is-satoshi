That's why you use more than one remailer and you encrypt the messages.
This guards against single-point failures...  Why?  One layer of encription is stripped by each remailer.  Use
three layers of encription and three remailers: The first remailer
will know that you sent something encripted; the third will see the
message and the destination but not know that you were the author.

Yeah....  So if your key can be snooped off the net, so can your
cleartext.  To decript online, then, is akin to using only weak
encription...which indicates only the desire for limited privacy.
But if even if you do decript online, you're still protected from
file snooping.
What's needed is PGP decription built into your terminal program.

In message <9303260732.AA23550 at soda.berkeley.edu> you write:
two points:
1.  An even more convienient way to distribute this filter would be
by having it available from the anonymizing server itself.  Mail to
filter-request at anon.foonet.bar to get a copy.  This is better for
sites that do not have ftp available.
1.5  A variant on this approach would be for the server itself to do
the blocking of mail.  Mail to block-my-mail at anon.foonet.bar.  Would
prevent that server from sending anonymous mail to you.  (the server
would, of course, send a receipt for the transaction to the user
who's mail is blocked...just in case of request forgery.)
2.  This would be a political win, but it would really be just a step
in the right direction since many people don't read their mail from
UNIX boxes....  PCs, Macs, Fidonet boards, VMS, etc.

All this is presuming that future and present net.users remain as
abreast of net activity as the frontiersmen (hi John) that were
adamant enough about uncensored communication to create the alt
Thankfully, the frontiersmen haven't ridden off into the sunset,
never to be seen again...and the number of net users with their
mindset has even grown.  But, the growth of the net also means
that there will be a continuing influx of people who think a lot
more about Monday night football than they think about censorship.
If, by this, you mean that the *REAL* battle is one of marketing, I
think that you're right.  People with censored feeds WON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE MISSING (because they don't get to see it)! And, if the votes for the right to anonymous expression are going to
be cast via economic choices, then it's important to remember that
it's not a one person one vote situation.

Here's a queer thought:
You've heard about the usenet dossiers that have been compiled and
sold to prospective employers?  How about a dossier-lookup function
integrated into your favorite news reader?  It would connect to a
dossier server and quickly provide a cross-reference of all the other
posts by the current poster...copies of the last 10 revisions of his
plan file...and an analysis of his individual quirks...(along with,
perhaps, a list of the top ten reasons not to hire him)....
Is this so off-base?  We've also been talking a lot about reputation
filters, which would probably require such activity logging.
Hell, it could even be put to a few good uses:  We could call up
Eric's dossier to quickly find his original remailer post to
alt.hackers...
