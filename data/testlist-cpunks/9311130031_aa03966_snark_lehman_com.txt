This is true.  If you were specifically referring to the example I
posted, it could probably be broken from the data presented if you
really put your mind to it.  However it is a fairly clever PRNG, and it
takes quite a bit of data to get the exact pattern.
It might not be feasible to create a cryptosystem using fractals and
chaos functions, but I think the possibility could be explored a bit
