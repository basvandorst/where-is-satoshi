Yet more incentive for starting a bank somewhere in the free world...
Ecash really would be a lot nicer if it were implemented in a multi-issuer system with even more choices for storing your money, like in an ecash money market account at a non-issuing institution.  I can wait.
I agree that there's little point in storing ecash on your hard drive past a slush amount for purchases (hopefully the sw will be smart enough to advise people as to how much to keep on hand)...ecash still requires a check with the bank before spending any cash, correct?  Ecash on disk doesn't protect against denial-of-service-through-networking attacks then.  Keeping ecash at MTB, however, wouldn't be my reason for keeping it at a remote location.  Probably.
If I had to conduct all of my banking in accordance with Mark Twain's fee schedule and legal restrictions, I'd be buying another mattress right now..well, maybe pillowcase.    By integrating all of these services under Mark Twain Bank Ecash Mint, I would get all of the advantages of a rather pricey bank, 4-5% loss on all my deposits, minimal privacy protection, no FDIC protection, $2500 initial deposit (not a problem for me, but it does keep many of the people I'd like to send money to out of the system..always a feature), and _tens_ of places to spend my ecash, only 4 or 5 of which that really sell things.

It's the amount required to earn interest on a World Currency Access account.
I was incorrect in assuming it was the minimum to start an account...it's just the minimum _I_ would have it in, because I do not like savings accounts which don't draw interest unless they're held in gold, offshore, or both.
