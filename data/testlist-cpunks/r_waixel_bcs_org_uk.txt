thorough article on the risks of installing 'smart' utility (Gas and/or
electricity) meters at:
It refers to a paper by Ross Anderson and Shailendra Fuloria ("Who controls
the off switch?")

metering / systems including
* unwanted intruders to the data held your house, in transit or at the
  utility, accessing when you are in/out or being able to have a good guess

such functionality is a possibility.  I know the suppliers will claim their
security is (will be) so perfect that it is ridiculous to consider this as
If it is a business of course, it might be a ripe source of potential
blackmail (greenmail or any colour of your choice).
I'm sure the data will be a tempting target at all stages of its journey
from home or business to utility's database.
