@_subject: A public experiment in how private our lives really are 
A reported has asked me for help in finding people who will help to pentrate the privacy of four volunteers, for a major newspaper story.
Any takers?  Contact the reporter:
   Reporter for major metro paper is interested in help finding out anything there is to find on four prominent people who have volunteered to have their privacy breached.
   Financial fundamentals. Lives of crime. Aches and pains. How rich they are, where they vacation, who they socialize with. You name it, we're interested in seeing if it's out there.
   All for a good cause.
   If you're willing to advise this computer-ignorant reporter, or dig in and get the dope on these volunteers, please contact him at tye at nws.globe.com
   Or call at +1 617 929 3342.
   Soon.
   Thanks.
Feel free to forward this far and wide.
