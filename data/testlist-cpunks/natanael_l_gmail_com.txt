This is precisely how I2P eepsites work. The true addresses are [52
characters of b32 encoded checksum of public key].b32.i2p while the
hosts.txt file is a list of these with their readable [sitename].i2p
domains. You can modify your own lists as you wish.
I2P Messenger and Bote mail could be combined to do what you suggest. :)

Apparently it's called "cascade encryption" or "cascade encipherment",
and the implementations are apparently called "robust combiners". And
by the way, Truecrypt already lets you pick your chosen combo of AES
and two other ciphers.
I think you should worry about your PRNG and it's seed before you
focus on AES. Your key should both have enough entropy and be secret.
Is your PRNG backdoored already? And I'm guessing the cipher mode
probably matters a bit more than the exact choice of algorithm.

Harden and trim something like Tails. Run the better minimum.
Don't do F2F at the lowest network layer. Don't give away sociograms, don't
allow timing attacks, and avoid the whole NAT issue.
Just stick with I2P or similar traffic anonymization networks and run your
traffic on top of that. Oneswarm (now abandoned, IIRC), RetroShare, or
whatever else, run that over the anonymizing networks. Inviting somebody
would be a matter of sharing the public key based address to the public
services and noting his public key so you can accept an invite request, or
directly send an invite to private mail of his like Bote mail or Pond.
I've done a lot of thinking on P2P social networks, I'll share later,
haven't written it all down yet. You can find a bunch of my thoughts on
these matters in my blog, there's multiple relevant posts there. I know approximately what I want and
how to make it easy to secure. One crucial part is key management where I
believe hardware tokens is the best solution, including for in-person key
exchange (see the developments for Bitcoin hardware wallets).

in the private fc:: range where the addresses are based on hashes of public

Then on top of that you could run anonymization like I2P and any other

IIRC support for that already exists in I2P, although not yet implemented.

Anonymizing routing in local networks can be hard to achieve against timing
attacks and other correlation attacks, in particular when assisted by DoS.
The problem is that there's typically a limited number of local routes
going outwards, poor interconnction and not many long-range links, and
node-to-node links reflect human sociograms very well. Having I2P being
able to support connections over both types of networks simultaneously
would be an advantage.

comment above. I'm trying to gather the various things I've written about
it now. There's a lot to write down. There's a lot of questions about how
to make it work without massive overhead. I'm trying to figure out how it
should work on each level of abstraction, from data encoding to routing to
key management, etc... I want to see a mainly P2P oriented system that
allows for server assistance (for distribution of signed data, storage,
receiving messages on your behald when you're offline, synchronization /
coordination, etc...). And I keep finding edge cases that would be messy
with most of the potential solutions I'm considering, which is another
reason for why I don't have a complete sketch written down yet.

There's an endless number of ways that malware that don't follow any neat
process isolation model with clean usage of API:s can cause what would be
experienced as glitches. Hiding executables in GPU memory assigned to fonts
can do that. And yes, that's 100% possible.
They might not want to show examples of the injection attacks in order to
not reveal how they're detecting the traffic. Look up NSA's Turmoil and
Quantum Insert.
First of all, it is written mostly for a non-technical audience.
Second, you're a bit stuck on the high-level models of computers here,
you're not considering how the effects of binary level tampering and code
exploits and altering RAM and even firmware for persistence attacks (

themselves. To somebody who thought he really did secure his systems well,
the signs that well obscured malware will show will make it look like your
computer has ghosts.
One problem is that the attacks change too fast. Holding off until they
change it themselves can allow you to detect even more of their activity
than anybody would if you told the world right away. Otherwise they'll
instantly stop the particular attacks you detected and switch to something
else. At best one could release details of how to analyze your old offline
backups for signs of infections.
