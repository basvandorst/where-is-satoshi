@_subject: "Assassination Politics" federal prosecutor assassinated  
Washington in Seattle, died as a result of gunshot wounds inflicted on
Thursday night, October 11. He was responsible for prosecuting major
business crimes and bank frauds. He was also the Executive Assistant U.S.
Attorney to former U.S. Attorney Katrina Pflaumer at the time of the
"Assassination Politics" prosecutions. The USAO obtained a conviction of
Carl Johnson for sending threatening e-mail messages to federal judges and
others. Specifically, Johnson was convicted of one count of retaliating
against a judicial officer, one count of obstructing justice by making a
death threat against a judicial officer, and two counts of transmitting
threatening communications. The first three counts pertained to death
threats against federal judges. The fourth count pertained to a death threat
sent to Bill Gates. Tim always said AP was a long shot.  I agree.  Probably an unsatisified "client" settling an old account.
