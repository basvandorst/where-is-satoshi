It's real simple folks. Turn the damn set off.
If parents wont accept the responsiblity to monitor what their kids watch, then they get what they get. If I don't want my kids watching television when I am gone, then I take the remote with me, as that is the only way my TV works.
The V-chip, like every other type of electronic lockbox devised to date, is nothing more than a band aid trying to cover the real problem - lack of attention paid to one's children and what they are doing. A govermental solution designed to regulate and legislate morality. History has demonstrated that every time a government makes attempts to enforce what is considered the basic tenants of civilized behavior then the game has already been lost. The people and the politics have become so corrupted that no form of democracy will survive for long - as it is dependant on the individual's willingness to abide by the principle of personal honesty.
