Is PGP v 2.6.1 up on any ftp sites where we poor non-US scum could get a
look at it? As Sat. Sept. 10 it seems like mathew over in the UK hadn't
seen the source code yet.

SUBJECT:  RC4 Source Code
I've tested this.  It is compatible with the RC4 object module
that comes in the various RSA toolkits.  typedef struct rc4_key
{           unsigned char state[256];            unsigned char x;             unsigned char y;
} rc4_key;
void prepare_key(unsigned char *key_data_ptr,int key_data_len,
rc4_key *key);
void rc4(unsigned char *buffer_ptr,int buffer_len,rc4_key * key);
 "rc4.h"
static void swap_byte(unsigned char *a, unsigned char *b);
void prepare_key(unsigned char *key_data_ptr, int key_data_len,
rc4_key *key)
     unsigned char swapByte;
     unsigned char index1;
     unsigned char index2;
     unsigned char* state;
     short counter;          state = &key->state[0];              for(counter = 0; counter < 256; counter++)                   state[counter] = counter;                    key->x = 0;          key->y = 0;          index1 = 0;          index2 = 0;                  for(counter = 0; counter < 256; counter++)           {                         index2 = (key_data_ptr[index1] + state[counter] +
index2) % 256;                          swap_byte(&state[counter], &state[index2]);                      index1 = (index1 + 1) % key_data_len;       }        }
 void rc4(unsigned char *buffer_ptr, int buffer_len, rc4_key
 {      unsigned char x;
     unsigned char y;
     unsigned char* state;
     unsigned char xorIndex;
     short counter;                   x = key->x;          y = key->y;          state = &key->state[0];              for(counter = 0; counter < buffer_len; counter ++)           {                         x = (x + 1) % 256;                                y = (state[x] + y) % 256;                         swap_byte(&state[x], &state[y]);                                  xorIndex = state[x] + (state[y]) % 256;                           buffer_ptr[counter] ^= state[xorIndex];               }                     key->x = x;           key->y = y;
 }
 static void swap_byte(unsigned char *a, unsigned char *b)
 {
     unsigned char swapByte;      swapByte = *a;      *a = *b;           *b = swapByte;
 }

@_subject: PGP sig bug is real 
The PGP signature bug is real. I have verified it in the 2.6 versions
for both the mac and unix.
If you check the sig on this message, it will pass, but the text you see
will not contain the first paragraph of this message. It was added after the
message was signed. A fix was posted to alt.security.pgp.  The sig on that
message (not by me) should pass.
