Afraid so.  But they do challenge hackers to break it (the old `here's
some ciphertext, doesn't this look secure?' thing).  They also offer a
`free demo version', but due to federal law they can't make it
available over the net so they do this:

How nice of them to offer this free trial.  And if you crack the
sample message, you *get a free copy of the weak software*. Neat, huh?

   There was an e-mail sent to the list that had attached to it a virus.  Well
   lucky me I got.  It was a .com file that apparently turns your files into
   directories.  I can't boot into Win95 since it turned my HIMEM.SYS into a

   E-cash, the product licensed by Digicash, offers full payee anonymity and
   would be an ideal candidate.
  ECASH AND PRIVACY
One of the unique features of ecash is payer anonymity. When paying
with ecash the identity of the payer is not revealed
automatically. This way the payer stays in control of information
about himself. During a payment a payer can of course identify
himself, but only when he chooses so.
Ecash offers one-sided anonymity; when clearing a transaction the
payee is identified by the bank.
    (according to But what about Okamoto and Ohta's digital cash scheme published in
Crypto '91?  It appears to be fully untraceable and transferable.  Of
course, I haven't heard of anyone trying to use this scheme (has it
been broken?)

   Yes, as a matter of fact it is.  /dev/random is based on an entropy pool
   taken from hardware interrupts and such, thus is a RNG, not a PRNG (thats
   right IPG, Linux uses hardware to get random numbers... imagine that!).
   /dev/urandom is, however, a PRNG...
Only if you try to pull out more bits than you can get from /dev/random.
Note that /dev/random on a single-user system doesn't generate bits
fast enough to be practical for OTP generation (try od -tc1
it lately, then reads will block until enough unpredictable things
happen ).  Of course, you can add more randomness sources.
How good a source would a radio or diode noise source connected to the
parallel port's IRQ input be?  It certainly sounds like it would be
cheap enough.

   cc: Bill Frantz ,
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Shannon proved that you cannot prove what the plaintext
   is for OTPs,
Let P, K, and C represent bit strings of equal length.  Given a
ciphertext C, for every plaintext P there exists a key K such that
  P XOR K = C.
This is true (K=P XOR C).
   or for the system we have developed either.
Let P and C represent byte strings of equal (arbitrary) length and K
represent the key string of fixed length.
The IPG algorithm can be summarized
  C = P XOR PRNG(K)
where PRNG(K) is the output of the pseudo-random number generator with
seed K.  The details of the PRNG are unimportant for this argument.
For every ciphertext C longer than K, there exists a plaintext P such that
no K will satisfy
  C = P XOR PRNG(K).
Proof: There are 256^length(K) possible keys (roughly 10^34322).
There are therefore at most this many possible decryotions of the
given plaintext.  Since length(C) > length(K), there are more possible
plaintexts than possible decryptions.
Shannon's proof of the security of the OTP therefore doesn't
apply to IPG's cipher.
Assume that the PRNG is resistant to analysis. Given the size of the
keyspace, it is not feasible to search the whole keyspace hoping
something like a plaintext pops out.  However, it is easy to take a
key obtained through some other means and verify that the plaintext
makes sense.  Since the PRNG is assumed resistant to analysis, this
constitutes proof that the plaintext is correct (since it's infeasible
to find a key that decrypts the ciphertext to another plausible
Of course, all encryption algorithms short of the OTP allow an
attacker to prove a key correct, but most cryptographers don't claim
their algorithms to be as secure as OTPs.

   >Any objections?
   given that mail2news at anon.lcs.mit.edu gets one of its USENET feeds via
   cyberpass.net, it would appear to be unnecessary if this recipe is in
   use. However, I do have one problem with this recipe: lack of
   loop prevention if a news2mail gateway is going in the other direction.
All the mailing-list hosts are supposed to check for duplicates before
forwarding anything, so this shouldn't do anything worse than have a
few extra copies of each post get discarded, loading the network and
the hosts a bit more.  But posting the list to a widely-distributed
newsgroup seems wrong for noise (both to the list itself and to
posters) and delay reasons.
    (I've crossposted this message to the remailer-operators
   mailing list to make sure it gets to the operators of the gateways in
   question.)
   In regards to your later query about whether people want their postings
   going to Usenet, might I suggest that this be individual to the given
   distributed mailing list? In other words, since the recipe is logically
   going to have to not forward to a gateway messages from other mailing
   lists (since it's not a good idea to have multiple copies of the same
   message arriving at the gateway if it can be helped; better to filter
   it out beforehand),
It doesn't seem an especially bad idea, since it    some of the mailing lists can forward and the
   others cannot. (One could even determine this behavior on application
   of the proper X-header, although I never trust various mailing systems
   to forward such intact.) The same could also be done with gatewaying
   _from_ Usenet - if the news2mail gateway feeds to whatever individual

   From: "E. Allen Smith"    on this matter, but...

   >Any objections?
   given that mail2news at anon.lcs.mit.edu gets one of its USENET feeds via
   cyberpass.net, it would appear to be unnecessary if this recipe is in
   use. However, I do have one problem with this recipe: lack of
   loop prevention if a news2mail gateway is going in the other direction.
All the mailing-list hosts are supposed to check for duplicates before
forwarding anything, so this shouldn't do anything worse than have a
few extra copies of each post get discarded, loading the network and
the hosts a bit more.  But posting the list to a widely-distributed
newsgroup seems wrong for noise (both to the list itself and to
posters) and delay reasons.
    (I've crossposted this message to the remailer-operators
   mailing list to make sure it gets to the operators of the gateways in
   question.)
   In regards to your later query about whether people want their postings
   going to Usenet, might I suggest that this be individual to the given
   distributed mailing list? In other words, since the recipe is logically
   going to have to not forward to a gateway messages from other mailing
   lists (since it's not a good idea to have multiple copies of the same
   message arriving at the gateway if it can be helped; better to filter
   it out beforehand),
It doesn't seem an especially bad idea, since it    some of the mailing lists can forward and the
   others cannot. (One could even determine this behavior on application
   of the proper X-header, although I never trust various mailing systems
   to forward such intact.) The same could also be done with gatewaying
   _from_ Usenet - if the news2mail gateway feeds to whatever individual
   lists sign up to it and they _don't_ forward such messages to others,
   people can decide whether or not to receive Usenet postings on
   alt.cypherpunks.* by which list they subscribe to.

My script preserves the Message-ID, assuming that the incoming message
has one.  Other gateways I've seen also appear to preserve Message-ID
lines (or at least messages posted through them appear to have
mail-like ID lines).   > The filtering

Not immediately sending a message back to the host that it came from
does look like a good idea (it came from foo.com, so foo.com obviously
has it).  Filtering out other gateways' messages will reduce load at
the possible expense of delay (assuming a smallish network of news
servers that feed each other the list; obviously the message will
flood the majordomo net before it floods the real usenet unless
something is seriously broken).

I didn't exactly say, but I was comparing a small network of news
servers feeding each other cypherpunks.list to, say,
alt.cypherpunks.list.  > But (especially given the options I mentioned below), this

I'm trying to come up with a way to provide NNTP access (and an
experimental alternative to the net-of-majordomos) that won't offend
anybody too much.  I can filter out messages that the authors don't
want sent out; I'd prefer to deal with what would make the authors
want the messages filtered out instead.

Yes.  Should have read:
It doesn't seem an especially bad idea to send a gateway multiple
copies of the same message, since theextra messages won't increase the
load much but will increase the reliability and decrease the
propagation time compared to a network where there are no duplicates.
The only case where filtering duplicates is certain not to hurt delay
or reliability is when the gateway in question is known to have a copy
of the message already.  Usenet uses the Path header for this; there
doesn't seem to be such a thing in the majordomo net.

No more so than a sufficiently bad news posting that came in over NNTP
(since the mails do turn into news postings over NNTP).

   thats it
If you just want the differences and aren't too concerned with
timeliness, I'm planning on running a cypherpunks-rejects list containing all
the messages that went out the unedited list but didn't show up on the
moderated one within x hours (not sure what x should be yet).

Not quite true.  I'm going to use one account on a host running qmail
to find the differences between the lists (one will go to
accountname-mod at qmailhost, the other to accountname-raw, and a cron
job will do the comparisons every few minutes).  If you have an
account on a unix box running sendmail, you can have .forward run a
program to sort messages out by sender into separate files for normal
mail, the raw list, and the moderated list.
   I wrote to Steve Case about this censorship problem, and I am waiting
   for him to respond.
   Do you want another account to get the censored list at?
