A word to the wise:
I can't reveal my sources but I have it on excellent authority
that L.Detweiler was recently interrogated by two FBI Agents in
Denver about BLACKNET. This is an investigation that has also involved
contacting TIM MAY but he has so far refused to reveal this. The
FBI Agent in Denver who investigated Detweiler is named JEFFERY
DIEHL. The investigation is CONTINUING and is chiefly motivated
by concerns about ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE, particularly ON THE INTERNET,
by the FBI and other government agencies.

@_subject: Crypto Declaration of Independance 
I have a proposal for you all.
I have started work on a Crypto Declaration of Independence, based on the
famous American work which represents Independence. With the incoming
batch of Congress and the new year approaching, I think that it's time
we assert what we believe in.  We need to let people know what we stand
for, and why we think it's a good idea. And with the (quasi)-recent
passage of the DigiTel proposal and Freeh's comments about banning
encryption, we need to wake people up.
However, asserting this to ourselves again would be akin to holding a
one-person conference.  We have rehashed these points amongst ourselves
many times.  Therefore, I propose that we spend some time revising this
work, based off the writing I will post if there is support for this idea,
then sign it, and email, fax and mail it to our respective news agencies,
government officials and interest groups.  However, without your support,
this endeavor would be fruitless.  Before I post the "beta version"/first
draft of the CDoI (for lack of a better term), I want to know if you (the
C'punks) will support it and help me.
Overall, I'm looking for answers to four questions:
1) Will you support and help this endeavor.
2) A target date for sending it out.
     First idea which came to mind: Jan 1st, 1995
3) A list of groups/people which should receive it.
     Government officials, news agencies, HOTtired, CPSR, EFF, ACLU, etc
   and along with 4) Ways for bringing it to people's attention.
I intend to keep myself anonymous during this process, so please contact me
by leaving a message on this list, or mailing everything within these
cutmarks to remailer at jpunix.com:

I percieve a 'chilling effect' going on with PGP compatible application development.  Nobody wants to extract the core PGP code into a library because the code is dense and who wants to do that every update?  Likewise with using PGPTools.  Who wants to re
write their application when the official PGP library materializes?  So people are waiting...
Could we get some updates on what is happening with the official pgp development?  If it's not coming soon, or not at all, it would be nice to know so we can get going on improving PGPTools or writing our own.

@_subject: pgp library 
Jim McCoy responds:
This is really a shame, because at the current time one of the most
lacking aspects of most crypto software is the key management
interface.  Encrypting and decrypting pgp format messages is easily
accomplished in an acceptable manner using the actual pgp binary.
However, writing a decent key-management interface is practically
impossible when your only interaction with the PGP key-management code
is via the system() function call.
Of course, shelling out to the PGP binary isn't the only solution.
It's not impossible to create a simple library for encrypting and
decrypting pgp format messages (there's PGPTools, and you can roll
your own).  But you are doubly screwed because the PGP development
team has made it clear that the keyring file format will change in
Who wants to spend time writing a key management API (which, I admit,
is NOT trivial...) which is guaranteed not to work in the next version
of PGP?  Why spend the effort to write a decent PGP front-end, which
would necessarily include a key-management interface, when 1) Any
effort expended in writing your own library or sprucing up PGPTools is
supposedly being duplicated by the PGP team as we speak, and 2) your
code is going to break anyway... ?
PGP front-ends aren't the only application type whose progress is
being slowed by this situation.  IMHO, any app that uses PK-crypto
should support PGPformat keys, even if it's output isn't designed to
be fed into PGP.
Don't get me wrong.  I understand how difficult it is to do this and I
am not ragging on the PGP developers for being slow or lazy or
anything like that (I know they are underpaid).  BUT, somebody must
write a PGP library if we are to see major advancement in the
penetration of crypto software into the mainstream.  The question is,
who is writing it?  It almost seems as if PGP development is now
happening in secret, and nobody really knows what the statusis on pgp
3.0 and the rumored library.  There are people on this list who know,
but nobody is telling.  If the PGP people really are making progress
on a PGP library, we need to know.  We can probably help.  If not, we
also need to know so we can write one.

@_subject: DDJ article on RC4 
Putting the Genie Back in the Bottle
What had all the earmarkings of a major-league food fight sure didn't take
long to dry up and blow away.  Triggering the flap was an internet posting
of source code that implemented the RC4 algorithm, an act that knocked on
all kinds of legal doors - trade secrets, Internet-host liabilities, reverse
engineering, shrink-wrap licensing, export control.  You name it.
   The problem is that RC4, the block-cipher encryption algorithm at the
heart of RSA Data Security cryptography, is protected as a trade secret.
But some on the net say the online posting let the genie out of the bottle -
RC4 was made public and available for anyone to use, RSA's claims
notwithstanding.  RSA counters that the company used trade-secret law
simply to protect its intellectual property, and there's never really been
any "secret" about the algorithm.  Anyone willing to sign a nondisclosure
agreement acknowledging RC4's trade-secret status could have ready access to
the reference and source code.  Among companies which have licensed
RC4-based tools from RSA are Microsoft, Novell, Apple, and Lotus, all of
which distribute RC4-based binary files in shrink-wrapped applications.
   You can imagine the furor when an unidentified person (or persons) used
an anonymous remailer to post worldwide - first to a cryptographer mailing
list, then to a newsgroup - source code that was supposedly RC4.  Subsequent
testing by programmers and cryptographers confirmed that the code was indeed
compatible with "real" RSA RC4 code.  RSA Data Security responded by calling
in everyone from the U.S. Customs Service to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.  In a strongly worded warning on the net, RSA said it
considered the posting "a violation of law ... [and] ... a gross abuse of
the Internet."
   If the person(s) who posted the source code had in fact signed an RSA
nondisclosure agreement, the issue seems pretty clear-cut.  They broke the
law, not to mention RSA's trust.  If, as some claim and RSA disputes, the
code was reverse-engineered from object files in off-the-shelf software,
then the law was probably broken - unless RSA and other vendors decide to
test the strength of highly questionable and likely unenforceable
shrink-wrap licenses that try to prohibit disassembly/decompilation.  Of
course, it just might be that some cryptographer derived the algorithm after
examining the key, plaintext, and ciphertext.  And there's even the chance,
albeit unlikely, that a dumpster diver ran across discarded copies in RSA's
corporate wastebasket.
   Questions concerning the legal status of copyrighted material that's made
freely available (illicitly or otherwise) on the Internet also have to be
tackled.  Can Internet hosts be held accountable for an anonymous postings
of protected material?  And don't forget, RC4 isn't just any software - it's
ENCRYPTION software.  Is posting such software online worldwide the same as
exporting it?  If so, the State Department might have a thing or two to say.
The end result is that RC4 code is available on ftp sites worldwide, ready
and waiting for you to use it.  But if you grab it off the net, can you use
it without RSA's permission?  For the time being, the answer probably
depends on which lawyer you ask.
   Speculation aside, the RC4 controversy explains why many developers are
protecting their intellectual property with patents instead of copyrights.
Gray areas like RC4 would be black and white if RC4 had been patented.  But
then patenting would also mean that RC4 would have been public in the first
   The immediate impact may be on RC5, the next-generation version of RC4,
which Ron Rivest describes in this issue.  In part because of the RC4
controversy, Ron and RSA Data Security are considering patenting RC5, a
departure from their original plans.  At one point, RC5 code and reference
was to be distributed free-of-charge for noncommercial use.  Small
businesses could license the material for $500, and large businesses, for
$1000.  All proceeds were to go to RSA Labs - not RSA's bottom line - to
fund further R&D.  This could still happen even if RSA patents RC5, but the
licensing fees would be higher to offset the patent costs.
   Likewise, there could be some repercussion in terms of exporting
RC4-based systems.  For the past couple of years, vendors have been allowed
to export software that uses RC4 short-key encryption.  The State Department
could change this since RC4 is no longer secret.
   As for the multitude of legal questions, nothing concrete will
immediately come of the RC4 brouhaha, unless those responsible for posting
the code are identified.  Existing RC4-based systems weren't compromised and
may have benefited, since we can now see that system backdoors don't exist.
   What we're left with are more questions, fewer answers, and the suspicion
that one of these days a big shoe is going to fall on software and
intellectual-property rights - one that won't make anyone completely happy.

Great idea, at least on the face of it.  Those in charge have a history
of assuming that if you want privacy and low profile then you must have
something to hide.  If I use remailers to obtain privacy / low profile,
why would I want to use a remailer that advertises itself as such?

The no 2 exists. And it works. It is a *great* system with the only
minus being that the address you create for yourself (your pseudonym)
looks silly.
You yourself define the reply block and it can be a PGP-nestled chain
through as many other remailers as you want before "hitting home". All
incoming mails are PGP -c encrypted with a password you choose
(which password you have previously sent off to the remailer
inside a PGP message encrypted with its public key).
For the public key and instructions, send a remailer-help msg to:
mg5n+remailer-help at andrew.cmu.edu (Automated reply from mail software)
Mail forwarding addresses are of the format mg5n+alias!nickname at andrew.cmu.edu
where "nickname" is a nickname of your choosing.  To create a mail alias,
create an encrypted 'reply-block' for a cypherpunks-style remailer.

Ah, so now we see why Mr. McDonald feels forced to interpret everything
Chomsky writes as meaning the exact opposite of what it says - why
Mr. McDonald thinks that Chomsky *must* be trying to promote
totalitarian repression, even though Chomsky nowhere advocates repression
of any kind.
Mr. McDonald infers this because, although Chomsky, if taken at face value,
does not _appear_ to be advocating "mass murder, and rule by terror",
McDonald __knows__ that:
1. a society without capitalism must be based on rule by terror.
2. anybody as intelligent as Chomsky knows (1).
thus anybody who advocates socialism is really advocating rule by terror
and so Chomsky clearly means the opposite of what he says.
Mr. McDonald's reasoning is perfect except that (1) is false.
If the "unwashed masses", the unruly mob should forget their place in life
(to be subservient to the elite, who are superior, because they claim they
are) and abolish the state, the army and the police and if they in their
foolishness should decide that they never liked capitalism and from now
on everything should be free then they have no need to oppress people like
Mr. McDonald if he wishes to try to accumulate capital by offering goods
and/or services for a price. Since everything is free in this hypothetical
society, nobody will have any reason to buy your goods and/or services
Mr. McDonald, because they can get them somewhere else for free. Thus
capitalism will never return (unless people who prefer a repressive society
restore capitalism by force) without anybody doing anything to repress
capitalism or other dissident ideas. I think this is the sort of society
Mr. Chomsky is advocating.
Of course, Mr. McDonald _knows_ that such a society is impossible because
everybody is as selfish as he is so nobody will want to share anything or
give anything away for free and they won't do so unless forced to.
Again, you are mistaken. The unwashed masses, while far from perfect, are
much more altruistic than right-wing cypherpunks such as yourself
(I realise that many cypherpunks are not right-wing) and when given the
chance they have shown that they prefer something that resembles Chomsky's
society more than the usual state/army/police-enforced capitalism. Examples
where the working class has had a brief taste of freedom are Paris, 1871,
Ukraine ~1917, Spain, 1920s and Derry, Ireland ~1969. In every case capitalism (Soviet state capitalism in the case of the Ukraine) was restored by force within a few months or years.
I don't think anyone thinks this mailing list is the right place to discuss your Chomsky conspiracy theories so if you haven't finished yet,
take them to alt.conspiracy.
Note: if Mr. McDonald pig-headedly insists on replying to this post on the mailing list, I will almost certainly ignore him, out of consideration for
the rest of you.

A lack of mileage standards, which are regulations on technology, can be
expected to result in technology that doesn't meet the standard.
If medical devices are sold without ANY limitation, e.g. the requirement
that they be safe and effective, the result is unsafe equipment.
Improved testing technology isn't useful if there's no requirement to
use it.  And "the market" is composed of people who have neither the
expertise to test the equipment before they consent to its use, nor (in
the case of someone's who's bleeding or in labor) the time.
In some cases, yes, I see problems in biotech.  For example, hormones
used in cattle in high doses are known to cause tumors in women in low
doses.  Whether people would choose to eat horemone-treated meat is
debatable; I had thought that the right to make the choice was taken by
cypherpunks as an article of faith.  Without regulation on the
technology, even an innocuous labeling requirement, the right to choose
is taken away because consumers can't detect the difference between
hormone-treated beef and organic beef.
Technological advance is a means to an end.  Regulations should properly
be about insuring the public welfare.  While we might reasonably
disagree about what that welfare is, clearly technological anarchy
doesn't promote it.
Either the market works or it doesn't.  You can't decry all government
regulation and then call for handouts to businessmen.
Actually, I think this is a great way to proceed.
