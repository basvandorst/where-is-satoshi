If it turns out that pressure to shut down really did come from the official
net hierarchy, there are other places on the net which should be nearly
immune from that kind of pressure.  There are thousands of UUCP sites which
predate the Internet.  And anyone getting their connectivity from one of the
commercial providers (PSI, UUNET, ANS, etc.) can theoretically use those networks for whatever purposes they choose.
