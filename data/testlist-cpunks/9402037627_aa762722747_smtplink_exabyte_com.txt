@_subject: Mail server for crypto files on csn.org? 
Problem:  the time-varying directory name changes too fast for reliable mail
server access to the crypto software on csn.org:/mpj/ for those who don't
have live ftp access, but are legally qualified to get that software under
the ITAR.  It IS possible, but you have to get README.MPJ then request the
software right away (before I log in to csn.org to check my mail the next
time -- usually one to three times a day whenever I feel like it).
Proposed solution   change the ITAR.  Unfortunately, I can't do this
unilaterally.  Write your Congressional Representative about changing the
Proposed solution   set up a "secure" mail server on csn.org itself.  My
idea is to have a filter program scan incoming mail for requests for crypto
programs.  The request would have to contain a statement that the requestor
won't break the law, as well as the names of the files requested.  If the
mail scanning program is able to detect a valid destination for crypto
software, it could then mail uuencoded or radix-64 encoded copies of the
software requested in the message.  Here is where I confess some ignorance
and ask for help:  How do I do this?  Could someone send me source code for
any automatic mail handling programs they have written for a Sun host, or
perhaps point me at some good documentation?  I could probably muddle through
this in time, but I'm not to proud to accept a head start.
