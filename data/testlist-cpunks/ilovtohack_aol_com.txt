The interesting fact here is that you all seem to have nothing better to do
with your time than converse over something so petty as an address error.....
I think you need to re-evaluate who the mental midgets are.....
I would hope the future of our world isn't in the hands of such petty
people such as yourselves...
Come on thake it easy on the guy at least he aint on AOL or somthing stuped.

THIS IS TO BRING OUT THE TRUTH AND INFORM THE PUBLIC ABOUT A POTINTAL THREAT
I was recently informed from sorces who choose to remain annomous about a viri
that uses macafe's update tool to detect when it is found then it modifys its
code and forms a new strain of the virus this pattern continues although it
has only been tested through a clone of macafees server to 100 mutations it
looks like it could be a big problem I will inform you of any more information
i learn about it but for now    "THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE"
