@_subject: [liberationtech] CfP: 2nd Workshop on Free and Open Communications 
Hello All,
This year Roger Dingledine of the Tor Project and I will be chairing the
2nd Workshop on Free and Open Communications on the Internet (FOCI), in
conjunction with the USENIX Security Symposium, on the 6th of August in
Bellevue, WA.
FOCI aims to bring together a community of researchers working on all
aspects of internet censorship. In addition to computer science
research, we are particularly keen to expand on the interdisciplinary
approach taken by the first workshop, and so are actively seeking
submissions from social and political sciences, law, economics,
activism, and any other field that can contribute to the discussion.
The full call for papers is available here:
I hope to see some of you there,
