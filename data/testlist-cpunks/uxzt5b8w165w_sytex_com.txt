Tim, I'll be glad to teach you how to file a Privacy Act request.
It's pretty simple, and it works on all Federal agencies.  You get all
records they are keeping on you, with some limited exceptions -- and
for almost all of those, you get notified of the withholding.  If you
can identify one or a small number of agencies that might be keeping
this "list", we can see if you are on it.  And if we find the list, we
can probably get the whole thing under the Freedom of Information Act.
