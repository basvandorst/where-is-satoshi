look, digslug, Justin Schwartz is an oxford-trained, yale-trained scholar,  now a lawyer with the seventh circuit.  he doesn't type things on a publicly accessible listserv where he can easily be quoted and humiliated for saying foolish things since the major new york papers monitor it for political gossip.  the man who typed that, justin schwartz, has written and published more than you've typed on usenet so you ought to just STFU&STFD because your attempts to crawl out of the gutter where you seem to happily luxuriate in the scum, grime and waste are embarrassing.
the examples you provide never come up with the goods--demonstrate that sources are untraceable, etc. your unpublished dissertation, i take it?  it will remain unpublished.  slop like that doesn't past the muster.  unless you're enrolled in Sally Struther's University, of course.
