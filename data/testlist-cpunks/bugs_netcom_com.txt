@_subject: security dynamics buys pkp? 
As I was trying to wake up this morning I heard an announcement on CNBC that
Security Dynamics purchased the RSA guys.  It was evidently a stock swap and
not a cash deal (interesting).

@_subject: US Power Outages 
The week before twa800 Clinton signed that executive order creating the
"infrastructure protection task force".  Now we are having massiv power
outages "caused by trees".  Sounds like they are trying to make swamp
gas fly again.

@_subject: Billy boy's satellites [Was - Floating DataHavens] 
Its been a little over a year but I had heard that the current design was
for a lower number of MEO satellites.  I would think that cypherpunks would want to see this happen.  The political
problems are probably larger than the technical ones :-)
