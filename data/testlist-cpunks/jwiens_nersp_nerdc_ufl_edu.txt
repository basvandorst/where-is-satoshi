Flip a coin each time you called out which entrace you wanted him to come
out of.  Couldn't have been predetermined that way.  Plus, since he's
hidden in the cave, he can't see you proving to the camera this is random
and therefore doesn't know you've foiled his intent.
Claiming it was a loaded coin after he hears about it?  :-) He could force
you to write down your list of tunnels in advance, and you must call off
the list in order.  Each time he correctly leaves the right tunnel, you
must show him the list to prove that you haven't faked the list or changed
the order.  You know he didn't see the list beforehand, you're convinced,
people watching your tape don't know he didn't see the list beforehand,
and won't be.
There's probably a much easier way of doing that, I imagine.
