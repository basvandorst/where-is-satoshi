@_subject: Colin Powell coming to Dallas 
Colin Powell will be in Dallas at the Taylor's Bookstore out on Belt Line Rd. and Prestonwood (right next to Prestonwood Mall).  October 3 at 6 PM.  I plan to be there - anyone else from the DFW area going?  Anyone have any questions they want asked (other than the usual "where do you stand on the administration's position regarding the use and exportation of so-called 'strong crypto' and the Clipper/Capstone fiasco"?
