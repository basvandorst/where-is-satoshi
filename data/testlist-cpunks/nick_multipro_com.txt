One of our former mayors in my town, was brought to trial for this. He had allegedly paid off a police officer and/or the airport to let the plane land. From what I have heard it was pretty cut and dry that he did it. But all he had to do was get a lawyer that caught the government prosecution with their pants down and he's running for city council this year. Its a shame. I haven't heard the DEA mentioned by anybody. Nick West

Don't expect his name to be cleared until they find another "suspect". The only reason he's being kept under investigation is to keep the FBI from coming under attack by the public for not having a suspect. In other words he's being kept as a poster boy for the case until they can find another one. Nick West

What are some of the better colleges/universities to study Computer/Network security at? I know MIT is a good one. Any others that aren't quite so hard to get in to that still offer quality Nick West
