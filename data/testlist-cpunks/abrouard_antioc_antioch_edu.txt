David Gelertner's NYT op ed piece seemed to suggest that the government
would gain no new information if the digital telephony bill is passed.
Quite obviously the ability to automatically scan for what one is interested in would be a tremendous boon to various agencies info gathering projects.
Even Gelernter must realize how hollow his reasoning sounds.
It makes one wonder what sort of critical thinking they're teaching at Yale
these days - or perhaps in whose pocket he's comfortably ensconsed.
