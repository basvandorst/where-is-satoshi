The boring recommendation: Debian
* Lots of eyeballs
* Timely security updates (well, timely as far as vendors go)
* A wealth of pre-packed software, which can be twiddled down to size
* Some fancy features out of the box (like remotely booting a LUKS
   encrypted root filesystem via an initramfs ssh daemon)
* Patching your locally installed (packaged) software must be done with
   Debian build scripts, or you quickly lose the benefits of the apt system
* Stupid patches have made it past the package maintainer (the OpenSSL
   2008 patch being the one that comes immediately to mind)
If you're willing to compile your own software or security updates, then I
think your choice of OS/distro may be mostly moot.
I'd recommend against a specialized security (linux) distro, unless you
know what you're doing. Support for many of them seems to be pretty spotty,
according to my unscientific observation from

What kinds of laws are we talking about? I'm genuinely interested in laws
(particularly US federal) that may unwittingly end me up in jail if I were
to encounter an over-zealous prosecutor.
The book mentioned below seems to focus on something different, based on
this Amazon review:
"With such a provocative title, I expected a thorough list of ways that
ordinary citizens can be unwittingly trapped by federal law. Maybe a
handful of frightening anecdotes, maybe some telling historical analysis.
Instead, after two lengthy introductions, I find a dense chapter defending
... a Florida politician accused of corruption. And a Massachusetts
governor. And a Massachusetts House speaker. When I got to the chapter
defending Michael Milken I started skimming instead of reading.
Don't get me wrong: if those people were railroaded, then they deserved
better. But those aren't the sort of stories that excite people's sympathy.
I'd much rather hear about innocent doctors getting tried for prescribing
legal painkillers (which Silverglate does address, albeit later), or
citizens being sent away for behavior that nobody knew was illegal. When
Silverglate writes about one politician going after another, my blood
doesn't exactly boil at the injustice being done.
Silverglate writes with a didactic, passionate style. It's likely to
inflame the hearts of people who already care about civil liberties. But
for people who don't see expanding federal power as that big of a deal, a
sob story about how Ken Lay was strung up won't elicit any sympathy.
All of the above would make the book 4 stars. I'm giving it 3 stars because
it's a substandard Kindle edition. There's no table of contents. The
footnotes don't hyperlink to the end of the text (a feature in every other
footnoted book I've read on Kindle). And for a book that's been out nearly
a year, it's still far too expensive."

References: For the small Telco I work for, there are a few scenarios where we "give
up" information:
* Customer billing dispute, in which case we'll provide or confirm
information that a customer already has printed on their bill, perhaps in
more detail if available.
* Trap and trace. This is triggered by a customer entering a star
code on their POTS phone, which stores the caller information (even if the
caller attempted to block their information) of the last call only, on the
switch for later retrieval. That information is only provided to local law
enforcement, and they only ask for it when a customer files a police report
* We have provided CDR information to a court when subpoenaed. This was not
completely information, since we only store CDR records of calls which
cross tolls trunks (calls which leave our switch). Local on-switch calls are not
billable, so we don't bother to store them. I assume this is standard policy
for other small ILECs.
We have never negotiated what information we provide to local authorities,
and have never been encouraged or ordered to keep X number of days of data.
The same goes for the ISP (broadband) side of the house. We've been
subpoenaed for information about who used what IP and when. We keep syslog
data for up to two months, for our own trouble shooting use.

I don't get the idea that releasing the Snowden docs in bulk and unfiltered
is entirely up to the media outlets listed. My guess is Snowden himself is
doing much of the metering. The slow, but consistent, rate of blockbuster
headlines is resulting in a punctuated evolutionary change in the public's
view of what the NSA is doing.
Remember headlines like this?:
By releasing information in this way, Snowden has clearly made liers out of
these head-in-the-sand politicians. By being specific, he has forced them
to defend one issue at a time. There can no longer be any blanket
statements of deniability. The onus is on the defenders of these secrets to
prove that they are false, to the American public.
Snowden is, simply put, one of the great American heros of our time. His
interests are clear, and his integrity has yet to be breached.

I could believe that he's not redacting information contained within
classified documents (which may raise suspicion about his motives).
There was an article posted to this list a couple of weeks back that
showed, at least in his initial contacts with journalists, that he was
being selective in what information he was providing them.

I'm not sure if you're referring to net neutrality (free market issue) or
NSA cable taps. The later is fixable to some degree by coding, the former

The ACLU is unlikely to get into the Wikileaks business.
It's time to win the public brain trust war. Leaks, in the last year, have
done much to shift public opinion, and will likely continue to help
tremendously.  That will only get us so far (in the US). We (the larger
tech community) need to cash in that momentum and turn that into political
change, particularly at the legislative level. However, that path needs
charismatic leaders, i.e. Lawrence Lessig, to actually run for office.

Charisma is needed to implement true change within our *existing*
government. Anarchy is an equally valid alternative path to true freedom,
but not one that am a proponent of.
I picked him as an example, since he's fairly well known, and has been
thrown around as a potential congressional candidate, or an employee of the
executive branch. He's someone with potential to change the legal landscape
in a significant way. Unfortunately he chose the route to change the
process rather than implement direct change (by becoming elected), which
has been a failure to date.
No, it's certainly not. This is where having good leadership helps. Much in
the way that coding is action in our community, becoming elected
(implementing law) is action in the political world, and nothing can be
done to change our government than to elect ~like minded individuals.
I have a much higher opinion of the American public. The problem isn't that
we have too much influence over our government, but not enough. The
ultimate fix is to somehow replace our legislative branch with true
