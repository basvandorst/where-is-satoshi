Really?  From the MIT Press's blurb:
"In Protocol, Alexander Galloway argues that the founding principle of the Net is control, not freedom, and that the controlling power lies in the technical protocols that make network connections (and disconnections) possible. He does this by treating the computer as a textual medium that is based on a technological language, code. Code, he argues, can be subject to the same kind of cultural and literary analysis as any natural language; computer languages have their own syntax, grammar, communities, and cultures. Instead of relying on established theoretical approaches, Galloway finds a new way to write about digital media, drawing on his backgrounds in computer programming and critical theory. "Discipline-hopping is a necessity when it comes to complicated socio-technical topics like protocol," he writes in the Oh dear.

I think that this cannot be used in evidence. The plain fact is that the
German government will pay only a fraction of what a company would pay.
 As an example (even though not one that could be applied to a job with
the federal government as a civil servant, but which I nevertheless
believe to be comparable), a PhD being paid according to the pay grade
known as TVöD 14 Step 1 will take home a base salary of roughly 1700
Euros, after taxes.  Also, prospects for promotion are slim and the
bureaucracy is terrible and cannot be evaded.

Hi Subrosa Team,
sounds like an interesting project!  I am however slightly confused
about what you mean by "hosted version" and "client".  Is this a web app
or is it a web app that also has a non-web (= hosted) version, providing
the same functionality, but where stuff (like RSA keypairs, for example)
is stored locally instead of on your servers?  If so, what exactly is
the "client"?

I know what you want to say (I think), but I believe that you are
incorrectly referring to such people as "Pussy Riot". The three
incarcerated Pussy Riot members have had immensely harsh sentences. They
called the Putin amnesty that set them free a "PR gag" and convinced at
least me that they were serious when they said that they would have
preferred to serve their sentences until the last day.
Sounds like people "who expect to suffer for their beliefs, and are
willing to do so" to me.
PS: If I recall (but I haven't checked), the incident in question was
singing an anti-Putin song in a church, not "tearing down someone else's
crucifix on someone else's property", for which they were convicted of

And that I think is going too far.  There might be perfectly valid
reasons to do what the developer did, and saying post-hoc that you fail
the audit because you don't like some design choices opens the door to
personal biases. (Good luck, for example, trying to write nontrivial C
without at least some form of pointer arithmetic.)
If you fail the audit, it's your duty as a professional auditor to
provide evidence that there is something actually wrong with the
software.  It's OK to single out some pieces of code for closer
inspection because of code smells, but if you try your darnedest to find
something wrong with it and can't, then either the code is OK or you're
not good enough an auditor.  In either case, you can flag the code, you
can recommend rewriting it according to what you think is better style,
but you can't in good conscience fail the audit.

Absolutely. My gripe was with the "automatic fail" of the OP.  It's
perfectly fine to say "this code doesn't look as if it was engineered
for safety and you should consider rewriting it", and you can say "I
can't audit this code, it's too complex for me", but you can't, IMHO,
say "I fail this code's audit because it has a number of code smells"
unless absence of code smells was a design requirement or there is
evidence that these code smells are associated with security problems.

I think that we are mostly in agreement, except perhaps in wording. We
both agree that auditors rarely "pass/fail" software in a binary
fashion.  And as I wrote, the auditor absolutely has the leeway to
recommend rewriting.
But my gripe was with the "automatic fail" in the original post, to
which I said that this was "going too far".  If you do go that far
(i.e., don't just recommend changes, but "fail" the audit), your verdict
must be founded on evidence.  For example, if it were actually true that
complexity, "empirically, provides cover for bugs", that would be a
perfectly good argument in favour of failing an audit.  It's just that
I've worked for a few years in precisely this field and all the studies
I saw simply failed to show the necessary correlations. (The best study
I know, by Yonghee Shin and Laurie Williams, shows rho <= 0.3, and that
on the vulnerability-infested Mozilla JavaScript engine. See
  This
shows, I think, that auditors must be extra careful not to confuse
folklore with evidence.
You can say "this code is too complex for me to audit", and you can add
"this should give you food for thought and you should consider rewriting
it in a simpler style", but *as the auditor* you cannot say "I fail the
code because I can't audit it" unless auditability was a design
requirement. (For the *owners* of the code, their options are of course
much greater, but we were talking about this from the auditor's
perspective, and the OP talked about an "automatic fail" if the code
turned out to have certain smells.  If a smell isn't backed up by
evidence, it's just a personal prejudice or folklore.  Which,
incidentally, would be excellent new terms to replace "Best Practice" in
many cases.)
Again, please note that I agree with you that auditability and
simplicity, using braces even for single-line if-statements, library
functions rather than self-made string libraries, and all these other
things, ought to be design requirements, especially for
security-critical software, because they make auditing easier.  It's
just that if it wasn't, then you can fault the design requirements
(though that may be outside your remit as auditor), but you can't
"automatically fail" the implementation.

belittling the effort that's described in this article (after
all, they found more vulnerabilities, which is good), I stand by my
original point.  If you want to fuzz the whole of bash, your chances
of uncovering ShellShock are essentially nil.  Once you know that
function definitions transported in environment variables (a feature
that I didn't even know existed, and I've been working with bash since
the late 90's) are probably bug-ridden, your work becomes much, much

If I understand the vulnerability correctly, it occurs in very specific circumstances, namely trailing data at the end of a function definition that's transported in an environment variable.
In that case, I'd venture that *no* kind of "basic fuzzing" could have uncovered this; the proportion of ShellShock-inducing environment variable definitions among all possible environment variables is simply too small.
What you would need instead is very specific syntax-directed fuzzing, and even then I'm not sure that you have a decent chance of discovering this without knowing already that it's there.
