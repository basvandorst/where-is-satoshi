Not answerable.  (Reason: substitute car, HIFI, medical doctor, etc. for 'software PRNG').
There are tests that one can implement with reasonable effort.
A test relevant in cryptology is Maurer's test. See Menezes et al.,
Handbook of Applied Cryptography.

Sorry that I haven't yet understood. Could you explain a bit more
from the entropy point of view? In my opinion, a statistical
test does not and should not take into account how a sequence
being tested is obtained. Given is simply a sequence and no other
information and the test should give an answer.

I don't see you have answered my question of whether a test has to
take into consideration how a sequence of numbers has been obtained.
Also what you wrote above seems to be less than clear. Do you suggest
that Mauerer's test is extremely good in deciding whether a sequence is TRULY random? (I think Maurer's test is good for investigating PRNG squences but maybe not used as a criterion between pseudo-
randomness and true randomness (whatever that may be defined)). What if some PRNGs pass Maurer's test?

I believe that there are quite a number. If I am allowed to cite my own stuff, a PRNG of my design did pass Maurer's test. See
