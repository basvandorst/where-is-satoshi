MotherJones MJ94:
Pretty good hellraisin'
Philip Zimmermann, our February 1994 Hellraiser, is rushing to finish
what he tentatively calls Voice PGP, named after his uncrackable
computer encryption program, Pretty Good Privacy. His new creation turns
a personal computer into a secure telephone--much to the consternation
of the feds.
Voice PGP uses a computer and high-speed modem to compress and encrypt
the caller's voice before transmitting it onto ordinary phone lines.
Only the called party can decode what the user is saying, in real time.
Why Zimmermann's hurry? "We have a window of opportunity to fill this
technology niche before the government acts," he says. Otherwise, once
U.S.  intelligence gets its hands on telephone surveillance technology,
"it will be like putting a sticker on every phone that says, 'J. Edgar
Hoover inside.'"
Zimmermann and other cypherpunks are already disturbed by the
government's decision to install the Clipper chip (an encryption device
whose passwords are known to both the user and the feds) in computer
communications software. His aim is to get Voice PGP out there (for
free, like PGP) and widely in use by the end of the year.

Mother Jones is pleased to announce the official release of our
redesigned WWW site, now called The MoJo Wire, on July 14th, at:
                    * See Newt Gingrich's secret list of major funders on our "Coin-
  Operated Congress" feature.  Gingrich is fighting the FEC in
  court to keep this information secret, but you can see it here
  for the first time.  See the ten worst, the ten richest, the
  dirt on all of them, and help complete this interactive
  investigation project.
* Newly revamped on-line chat software, called Live Wire,
  provides the best Web-based political discussions anywhere.
  Create hyperlinks in the words of others in this new feature,
  which already contains several lively debates.
* The July/August issue of Mother Jones magazine is available
  only on The MoJo Wire.  Read the full text of the magazine.
Many thanks to our team of two thousand beta testers!  With your
help, we've worked a few of the last kinks out of the system,
added a few things, and now offer the service password-free.
