@_subject: [liberationtech] Call for hardware researchers/hackers 
Ladies and Gentlemen of LibTech,
I've been tasked with writing an article for ArsTechnica on the theme of "Technologies of freedom
and repression" -- obviously some of the New America stuff (Internet-in-a-suitcase), DPI and Tor come to mind, but I'm wondering if there are others that I should know about for  networking and for mobile phones and related infrastructure. This would be both from the good guy side and what's used to detect it/block it, et cetera.
I'm more interested in the kit, the hardware, than software. Any suggestions?
