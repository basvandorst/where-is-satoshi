This article makes an interesting point, we got to dig a bit more from our pockets:
The second point I wish to make is the surprise by which the original developer took the issue. Maybe, just maybe, he did not create that flaw at all.
It could have been inserted into the OpenSSL repository through a backdoor ... or why would the spies by so interested in hacking professors that deal with crypto and whose word is trusted by the masses? Like they did to a Belgian cryptographer? Was that fellow nerd a turrist of sorts?
It may be possible that Segelmann did his job correctly, that the reviewer did his job correctly, but someone unknown may have changed it just a little bit before delivery.
Besides funding projects like OpenSSL better, we should start considering the security of the repositories themselves.
What ya fellow coders think?
