A randomly setup ssh server without DNS will find itself brute force  attacked. Darknets are setup specifically for detection of scans. One side effect of v6, is determining how best to deploy darknets, as we can't just take one or two blocks to do it anymore. We'll need to interweave the darknets with the production blocks. I wish it was possible via DHCPv6-PD to assign a block minus a sub-block (hey, don't use this /64 in the /48 I gave you). It could be that darknets will have to go and flow analysis is all we'll be left with.
