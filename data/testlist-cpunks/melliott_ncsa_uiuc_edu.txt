For my cable company I asked why they wanted it.  For a security check when
you call in was the response.  Does it need to be an actuall social
security number?  No, just something you can remember when you call up.
012-01-0123 I replied.  They were quite happy to use that as my "Social
Security Number" in their database.    As far as cable goes they don't want
your social security number.  I wonder how many others would be happy to
substitute something.

I think it is appropriate.  Take "Believer" to court and hope I don't happen to be sitting on the jury.

And just to clear up some silly misconception people have.  SSN numbers are not indicative of where someone was born.  Only where they applied for a SSN number.

Pig Latin or even the old 10 codes as in 10-4 are against the amateur
rules.  The only allowed code scheme is morse code and Q codes.  Both are
clasified as a well defined language.  Using english and having a
conversation that means something other than the standard usage is also
prohibited.  If you don't like it then stick to CB-Radio.  At least that is
the FCC's position.

References: Federal law that trumps the state's laws.  The federal laws only applies to
certain classes of absentees.  For those that weren't covered by the
Federal standard the state standard applies.  I believe the state standard
applies to state and local offices as well.  So the late arriving ballots
will only effect the national offices, not the state ones.
But since I'm in Tim's kill file he won't get to see any of this wisdom.

Clearly this can't be true or every health insurance company would be going
out of business.  Coverage has to be more expensive than care of they
wouldn't be in the business of providing coverage.

One small correction Kevin, they have the right to put their information
into their own public forum.  I don't have to allow them to put their
information in my newspaper or allow their bits to travel across sections
of the Internet that I own.  I don't have to make it easy for them to
spread their nonsense.

I just tried a can of compressed air (upside down so it sprays liquid), It
is really,
1,1,1,2 Tetrafluoroehtane, not air.  But anyway.  It doesn't make a
security envelope transparent but it does for plain old white envelopes.
You can pick the stuff up at Radio Shack if you want to try it out
yourself.  Just be careful not to freeze your hands when the liquid comes
streaming out of the nozzle.
