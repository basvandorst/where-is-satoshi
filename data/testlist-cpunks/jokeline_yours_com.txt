Play A Joke On A Friend, Colleague,
            Relative Or Even An Enemy
     Call Jokeline and you'll be in stitches!
   With our new service you're able to wind-up,     confuse and bemuse people with a choice of
    hoax callers that you can transfer to your
   victim on any UK landline or mobile and then
  listen in to the call and hear their reaction
  Don't worry though, they won't be able to hear
   you, nor tell that you made the call - try it
      on a speaker phone and a group can hear
       Just use the easy to follow recipe:
           (i) choose one ripe victim
   (ii) add Jokeline by dialling 0906 736 9265
               (iii) then select:
      1 - Wind-up samples
      2 - Mr Angry
      3 - The Irate Delivery Driver
      4 - An Invite To No 10
      5 - Suspect Package In Your Street
      6 - You're Wanted At The Police Station
      7 - The Tax Inspector
      8 - You've Got My Daughter Pregnant
          (iv) enter your victims number
           (v)   wait for the transfer
   (vi) when they answer, prepare yourself and
                    ...enjoy!
         This has got to be the funniest
             joke to play on anyone
 Please note: this service is a harmless bit of
 adult fun and the recipient of such a call will
 be informed it was a joke at the end of the call
