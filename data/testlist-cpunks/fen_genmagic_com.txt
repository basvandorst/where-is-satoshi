@_subject: Mac PGP version 
I pulled it down and found it to be a "nice little app" with certain
problems evident from the beginning.  The major bug is **no source code**!!
 How can I trust an app to make my keys?  Why don't I just ask the NSA for
What I would have liked (and expected) was a set of diff (or changed) files
from the PGP 2.0 distribution, and perhaps an extra top-level app-maker
file to put the nice wisiwyg on top.  This would show me an example, and
let me build PGP into other apps that I might build.
The next bug is no email address for Z. Fiedorowicz, so I can't complain to
him directly.
And the third apparent bug (now I haven't used this much yet) is that the
help file offers help for the standard MPW-style command line operations,
but the app is entirely menu-driven.
I hope that ZF doesn't take this as purely negative.  I am sure that he did
a good implementation, and I thank him for doing the work and for providing
a nice gui.  But I would especially like to get the source code (preferably
as minimal changes to the standard distribution so that it is clear that
the same internals are used for each).

@_subject: Anymous Remailers and Newsposters 
I just thought I'd mention that there are several anonymous remailers
currently in use by users of the alt.sex.bondage newsgroup.  Unfortunately,
I don't have the addresses handy, but they re-post the address and
instructions for use every week or so...

@_subject: How far is to far? 
I see two answers: one is public censure, which has appeared to work to a
large extent in at least one newsgroup whose users make habitual use of an
anonymous remailer (alt.sex.bondage) .
Another is broadcatch, a favorite topic of mine, which is concerned with
the filtering of information.  (Note:  where "broadcast" is a
subscriber system, "broadcatch" scans many sources for information relevant
to one subscriber.  The end result is less quantity and higher quality.) With broadcatch, you could turn off threads of conversation you were not
interested in, block out flamers, and IGNORE ANONYMOUS EMAIL in general. Of course, pseudonyms may come to be trusted and thus not filtered out,
though they, too, are cryptographically anonymous.  (Another common
mechanism of broadcatch filters is to allow through articles with mentions
of the subscriber's name.)
Also, in the long run, when networks are made up of smarter, cooperating
machines, neighboring machines to a flamer that is generating mass ammounts
of email will begin to choose not to listen as often at that address.
In sum, I think that it is someone's right to say anything they want, as
long as I don't have to listen.

On the issue of digital cash and remailers
Note that a good reputation is good as gold.  Now, when I get my remailer up
and running, I'll run it for a while in "free mode" (while I get the bugs out)
and then I'll put it into "reputation sharing mode" which works as follows:
Every time I get a message to be re-mailed, I remember the sender's site
name.  Later, when I desire to mail something, I may choose to send it through
that site.  If operating in free mode, it passes through.  If it is not a
remailer or doesn't accept my message (via a bounce) I take it off my list
of friendly mailers and and begin bouncing messages that it sends to me. This should, of course, all happen automagically.
I realize that I am describing this somewhat poorly (it's late and I'm tired)
but the basic concept is to get everuyone who wants to send mail through a
re-mailer to become a remailer, or perhaps buy "friendship" with one
through external means.  This propogates remailers.
The simplest form of barter is one for one.

@_subject: remailers 
]
[ mark at coombs.anu.edu.au (Mark) agrees: ]
First, things are changing.  More and more people are owning their own
machines and setting up their own mail.  Heck, I'm planning on having my
own internet node at home!
Second, we need to proliferate remailers.  Get the students running the
system to install the code (perhaps for credit!).  Or, if you're at a
company, explain to the sysadmin that you need to have access to information
that is only availble from sources on the other side of remailers, or,
perhaps more generally, just indicate that you need connectivity and that
not being a remailer cuts down on the number of sites that you can connect
Finally, perhaps a "student" rating can be added (in addition to "free"
and "reputation-based").
Keeping track of the reputations of remailers is a first step to being
able to keep track of the reputations of signatures (whether real or
pseudonymous).  The next step is the active filtering based on such info.

I am way excited to see this all coming together!  It's like a 13-year-

This is a great statement of purpose, though I might leave "DC-nets" out
(since many won't know what that means) and perhaps replace it with the
only slightly-less-cryptic "information-theoretically-secure networks",
or some such.

      Background:
      SEIZING THE MEDIA is the title of pamphlet written by the
      Immediast Underground and first released in Amsterdam ,
      New York City, and Seattle in early 1992. The 26 pamphlet
      combines theory, graphics, research and proposals that examine:
                    * Information control
                    * Propaganda and advertising
                    * CIA
                    * Mind control
                    * Immediast counter-offensives
                    * tactics, subversive networking, public empowerment
                    * multi-media
                    * Public production libraries
                    * the liberation of public space
       ...Just when Jesse Helms thought he made the world safe from
       poetic terrorism, along come the Immediasts, a cadre of media        hackers who are fed up with the ecology of coercion that        surrounds them. Their booklet SEIZING THE MEDIA proposes an        all-out artistic assault on coercive communication, cultural        monologue, and media control. They want all media insurgents        to take back the airwaves with pirate radio, cable access TV,        altering ads and billboards, and otherwise hacking the        datasphere to break the spell of State/corporate media control.
       SEIZING THE MEDIA Version 1.1 is available for $3 from
       Open Media PO Box 2726  Westfield New Jersey 07091 USA
       THE IMMEDIAST UNDERGROUND is a centerless network of artists,
       writiers, hackers, culture jammers, pirate broadcasters, and
       posterists who connect with one another through information
       systems, mail art, networker congresses, and the underground
       press, and who communicate with the public through actions
       against all forms of coercive communication, space
       infringement, and media control.

       DECENTRALIZED WORLD-WIDE NETWORKER CONGRESSES
       Since the beginning of the year, members of alternative
       info-nets, artists, insurgents, and cultural workers have
       been holding networker congresses, transnational engagements        in cultural production, dialogue, collaborations, open        exchange, subversive brainstorming, and collective        disruptions of dominant culture.
       THE NETWORKER, A NEW PERCEPTION
       In societies where information is money and media is power,
       public access is as controlled as the corporate states grip        on communication law, censorship, commerce, covert action        and surveillance. In this context, uninhibited public        communication, expression, and cultural production are acts        of freedom, sovereignty, and defiance. Rooted in the drive to        connect and exchange with others, Networker Congress engage        in culture and media as the battleground for greater openness        and freedom.

----------- Forwarded Message ------------
Sender: uunet!TIS.COM!pem-dev-relay
Let me throw in another vote against the *necessity* of hierarchical
certification by arguing against the necessity of certification itself.
For example, it is possible, given digital signatures, to have totally
anonymous bank accounts -- identified only by public key -- with no
certification of relationship between that key and any other fact about any
individual or corporation.  Such accounts are at least as valuable as a
Swiss numbered account -- perhaps more so since no one need know the
identity of the person or people with the power to withdraw funds.  Such
funds transfers can be made not only anonymously but untraceably.  It might
even be possible for them to be made without it being possible to trace
the transfer at either end (eg., using digital cash techniques).
I don't propose that all bank accounts be anonymous.  It's just that I
don't like to see us jump into an attempt to relate public keys into the
physical world so that our old established notions about relationships and
responsibility can carry over into this new domain when by doing that we
end up avoiding research into all the possibilities which digital
signatures open up.  That research needs to be both technical and social --
or we could shy away from it by forcing relationships between keys and
those entities to which we are already accustomed.

There are several mac un-zip programs available for anonymous ftp from
sumex.stanford.edu (cd info-mac/util; mget unzip-11.hqx mac-zip-10.hqx). A person here has put a short amount of effort into "macifying" PGP.
He's gotten it to compile in Think and MPW, but it won't run yet.
According to him, the technical reason is that some sort of "goofy
bus-error bullshit" is occuring, and so, if you figure it out, please
let this list know (as well as possible posting it to alt.crypt.sources,
if such exists).  We will do the same.

      Background:
      SEIZING THE MEDIA is the title of pamphlet written by the
      Immediast Underground and first released in Amsterdam ,
      New York City, and Seattle in early 1992. The 26 pamphlet
      combines theory, graphics, research and proposals that examine:
                    * Information control
                    * Propaganda and advertising
                    * CIA
                    * Mind control
                    * Immediast counter-offensives
                    * tactics, subversive networking, public empowerment
                    * multi-media
                    * Public production libraries
                    * the liberation of public space
       ...Just when Jesse Helms thought he made the world safe from
       poetic terrorism, along come the Immediasts, a cadre of media        hackers who are fed up with the ecology of coercion that        surrounds them. Their booklet SEIZING THE MEDIA proposes an        all-out artistic assault on coercive communication, cultural        monologue, and media control. They want all media insurgents        to take back the airwaves with pirate radio, cable access TV,        altering ads and billboards, and otherwise hacking the        datasphere to break the spell of State/corporate media control.
       SEIZING THE MEDIA Version 1.1 is available for $3 from
       Open Media PO Box 2726  Westfield New Jersey 07091 USA
       THE IMMEDIAST UNDERGROUND is a centerless network of artists,
       writiers, hackers, culture jammers, pirate broadcasters, and
       posterists who connect with one another through information
       systems, mail art, networker congresses, and the underground
       press, and who communicate with the public through actions
       against all forms of coercive communication, space
       infringement, and media control.

       DECENTRALIZED WORLD-WIDE NETWORKER CONGRESSES
       Since the beginning of the year, members of alternative
       info-nets, artists, insurgents, and cultural workers have
       been holding networker congresses, transnational engagements        in cultural production, dialogue, collaborations, open        exchange, subversive brainstorming, and collective        disruptions of dominant culture.
       THE NETWORKER, A NEW PERCEPTION
       In societies where information is money and media is power,
       public access is as controlled as the corporate states grip        on communication law, censorship, commerce, covert action        and surveillance. In this context, uninhibited public        communication, expression, and cultural production are acts        of freedom, sovereignty, and defiance. Rooted in the drive to        connect and exchange with others, Networker Congress engage        in culture and media as the battleground for greater openness        and freedom.
