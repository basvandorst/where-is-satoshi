@_subject: [Dgcchat] AxiomaticTokenizer 2.5 
AxiomaticTokenizer 2.5 has been released.
Main features
Multi-service support.
Multi-currency support.
Actions for online payment services: Create account, Modify account
passphrase, Add inheritor, Remove inheritor, Login account, Make
Asymmetric encryption (RSA) for sending the user's "passphrase" to the
Customizable token hash size. This is meant to reduce the amount of
characters which users need to type.
Optional spy protection for tokens. The disadvantage of this protection
is that it increases significantly the size of tokens.
Private account names. By simply adding " at the end of an account
name, the account name sent to the service is actually a mix of the
written account name and of the service's name, in a way which
effectively hides the written account name from the service.
Color themes.
Multi-language support.
Table with mappings between two dice and characters. This is meant to
help users to generate truly random passphrases.
Multi-platform: Firefox, InternetExplorer, InternetExplorer Mobile,
Opera, Safari.
Easy to check HTML and JavaScript open source code.
Token example: "AT1; AT; MP; 20071206; 174853; AkulaAlice; BobBonkers;
AUG; 100; C28-BA3-86C-E87-434-B;"
