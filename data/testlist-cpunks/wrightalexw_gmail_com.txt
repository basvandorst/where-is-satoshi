Accept anyone's right to say (or register) as they please but reserve
the right to think it's dumb.

I put text in a box.  I click a button.  That text is transported to people
across the globe.  Fucking people need to get over some UI shit.

I can't imagine trusting enough people that I can't see to necessitate a

Previously sent right to Joshua Case because ... I'm special...
I for one found it an interesting jump off point.  I didn't know much about

Firefox asked me about sharing Geo info today.  I don't often use Firefox
