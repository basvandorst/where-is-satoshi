Period 5 noble gas element Z=54 sez:
Except, PGP was not developed behind closed doors, anyone can download
PGP23srcA.ZIP and read the full specs on the encryption system used, and
you don't have to register your key with Phil Zimmerman.
So?  So what if Microsoft has a crypto division...  Maybe it will
encourage more people to use crypto. (I wouldn't place much trust in
Microsoft software tho, judging from some of their past foulups.)  Sony
Encryptorman might be a bit better (if it exists) since they're not in
the US.
