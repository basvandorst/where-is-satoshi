@_subject: i want to know you! 
Aloha, dear
I am looking for my Destiny, because I am fed up of being a woman with a big and passionate heart which is single like a lonely island into a big Life's I have never felt true temptation into my life, but I want to know it.
Love is like long summer into your soul, will you agree with me? And it is very difficult to live without it...
I am going to meet with you, My Destiny, you are my Destiny, I feel it. I am going to meet with you and to give a key from my heart for you.
You're welcome into my world! I feel that our virtual acquaintance isn't occasional. Write me, please I promise you that my life will be yours and your life will become mine.
Sole S.
