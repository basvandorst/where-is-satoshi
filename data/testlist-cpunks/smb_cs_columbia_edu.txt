@_subject: Dell to Add Security Chip to PCs  
<42031E13.4040205 I have no idea whether or not the bad guys are laughing about it, but if they are, I agree with them -- I'm very afriad that this chip will make matters worse, not better.  With one exception -- preventing the theft of very sensitive user-owned private keys -- I don't think that the TCPA chip is solving the right problems.  *Maybe* it will solve the problems of a future operating system architecture; on today's systems, it doesn't help, and probably makes matters worse.
TCPA is a way to raise the walls between programs executing in different protection spaces.  So far, so good.  Now -- tell me the last time you saw an OS flaw that directly exploited flaws in conventional memory protection or process isolation?  They're *very* rare.
The problems we see are code bugs and architectural failures.  A buffer overflow in a Web browser still compromises the browser; if the now-evil browser is capable of writing files, registry entries, etc., the user's machine is still capable of being turned into a spam engine, etc.  Sure, in some new OS there might be restrictions on what such an application can do, but you can implement those restrictions with today's hardware.  Again, the problem is in the OS architecture, not in the limitations of its hardware isolation.
I can certainly imagine an operating system that does a much better job of isolating processes.  (In fact, I've worked on such things; if you're interested, see my papers on sub-operating systems and separate IP addresses per process group.)  But I don't see that TCPA chips add much over today's memory management architectures.  Furthermore, as Dan points out, it may make things worse -- the safety of the OS depends on the userland/kernel interface, which in turn is heavily dependent on the complexity of the privileged kernel modules.  If you put too much complex code in your kernel -- and from the talks I've heard this is exactly what Microsoft is planning -- it's not going to help the situation at all.  Indeed, as Dan points out, it may make matters worse.
Microsoft's current secure coding initiative is a good idea, and from what I've seen they're doing a good job of it.  In 5 years, I wouldn't be at all surprised if the rate of simple bugs -- the buffer overflows, format string errors, race conditions, etc. -- was much lower in Windows and Office than in competing open source products.  (I would add that this gain has come at a *very* high monetary cost -- training, code reviews, etc., aren't cheap.)  The remaining danger -- and it's a big one -- is the architecture flaws, where ease of use and functionality often lead to danger.  Getting this right -- getting it easy to use *and* secure -- is the real challenge.  Nor are competing products immune; the drive to make KDE and Gnome (and for that matter MacOS X) as easy to use (well, easier to use) than Windows is likely to lead to the same downward security sprial.
I'm ranting, and this is going off-topic.  My bottom line: does this chip solve real problems that aren't solvable with today's technology?  Other than protecting keys -- and, of course, DRM -- I'm very far from convinced of it.  "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in

I have the book.  For the student of the history of cryptography, it's worth reading.  For the less dedicated, it's less worthwhile.  It's not "The Codebreakers"; it's not "The Code Book"; other than the title quote (and I assume most readers of this list know the story behind it), there are no major historical insights.
The most important insight, other than Yardley's personality, is what he was and wasn't as a cryptanalyst.  The capsule summary is that he was *not* a cryptanalytic superstar.  In that, he was in no way a peer of or a competitor to Friedman.  His primary ability was as a manager and entrepreneur -- he could sell the notion of a Black Chamber (with the notorious exception of his failure with Stimson), and he could recruit good (but not always great) people.  But he never adapted technically.  His forte was codes -- he know how to create them and how to crack them.  But the world's cryptanalytic services were also learning how to crack them with great regularity; that, as much as greater ease of use, was behind the widespread adoption of machine cryptography (Enigma, M-209, Typex, Purple, etc.) during the interwar
period.  Yardley never adapted and hence he (and his organizations) became technologically obsolete.
One of the reviews on Amazon.com noted skeptically Kahn's claim that Friedman was jealous of Yardley's success with women.  I have no idea if that's true, though moralistic revulsion may be closer.  But I wonder if the root of the personal antagonism may be more that of the technocrat for the manager...

@_subject: Encryption plugins for gaim  
<20050315192048.GA25086 Let me second the recommendation for jabber (though I wish the code quality of some of the components were better).  The protocol itself supports TLS for client-to-server encryption; you can also have AIM (or other IM) gateways on that server.  In many situations (i.e., wireless), it protects the most vulnerable link from eavesdropping.  While clearly not as good as end-to-end encryption, it's far better than nothing, especially in high-threat environments such as the IETF...  (Of course, I only know of one open source client -- psi -- that checks the server certificate.)  In theory, server-to-server communications can also be TLS-protected, though I don't know if any platforms support that.
On top of any other encryption, many implementations support PGP encryption between correspondents.  I don't know of any support for e2e-encrypted chat rooms.
I haven't played with OTR, nor am I convinced of the threat model.  That said, what you really need to watch out for is the transcript files on your own machine...

Given what a small percentage of ecommerce goes to those sites, I don't think it's really noticeable.
Sure -- but setting up WEP is a nuisance.  SSL (mostly) just works.  As for your assertion that no one is listening, I'm not sure what kind of evidence you'd seek.  There's plenty of evidence that people abuse unprotected access points to gain connectivity.
Sure -- that's certainly the easy way to do it.

Folks on this list may be interested in a new tech report:
The IPsec protocol promised easy, ubiquitous encryption. That has never happened. For the most part, IPsec usage is confined to VPNs for road warriors, largely due to needless configuration complexity and incompatible implementations.  We have designed a simple VPN configuration language that hides the unwanted complexities. Virtually no options are necessary or possible. The administrator specifies the absolute minimum of information: the authorized hosts, their operating systems, and a little about the network topology; everything else, including certificate generation, is automatic. Our implementation includes a multitarget compiler, which generates implementation-specific configuration files for three different platforms; others are easy to add.

The two Ian G's have it correct: while OTR provides (some level of) lack of evidence within the system, it says nothing about external evidence like netflow records, which machine the logs were taken from, etc.  To pick one bad example -- bad because I don't know if it fits the facts of this case -- if one party to a purported conversation turned over a log file, and forensic examination of the second party's computer showed the same log, I suspect that most people would believe that those two parties had that conversation.  Of course, the authenticity of the log files could be challenged -- did the first party hack into the second party's computer and plant the log file?  had someone else hacked into it and used it to talk with the first party? -- but that's also outside the crypto protocol.
Put another way, the goal in a trial is not a mathematical proof, it's proof to a certain standard of evidence, based on many different pieces of data.  Life isn't a cryptographic protocol.
