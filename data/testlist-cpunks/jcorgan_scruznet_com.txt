@_subject: GUI: PGP vs novices 
I only have familiarity with the commercial Netmanage Chameleon Winsock
implementation.  Someone else had let me know about this potential difficulty.  Apparently some Winsock stacks only provide a WINSOCK.DLL for
3rd party compatibility, i.e., their own applications talk to proprietary
hooks into their stack for performance or other reasons.  Netmanage's products
do both; they perform their network I/O through WINSOCK.DLL, but also use
a variety of shared library functions supplied with the rest of the stack.  In
this case, my WINSOCK.DLL shim works fine.  Remember, I'm not replacing a
given implementation's DLL, just intercepting and passing through calls to
it.  So as long as a mail application uses exclusively standards based
Windows Sockets API calls _to perform network I/O_, my product should work.
YMMV, of course :)

@_subject: Reminder: January 14th "Tools Demo Day" Meeting 
Some may recall an idea I wrote about a couple weeks ago to provide
transparent encryption/signing/remailing facilities to users of Windows Sockets based mail agents on PC's (e.g., Eudora).
I have completed an initial portion of the program as a "proof of
concept."  All it does right now is act as a SMTP server and accepts
mail from a mail agent, performs requested encryption/signing operations
on received messages, and puts RFC 822 compliant outbound messages in a
directory for submission to a 'real' SMTP server. (No remailing features
Of course, the next module to write is the SMTP client that takes this
outbound message queue and sends it off to the actual SMTP server.
It is a bare bones app with no user interface, fault tolerance, or
configuration options, and probably only works on my machine at the
moment :)
I don't expect to make any significant progress on the program between
now and the Jan. 14 meeting, but if anyone is interested I will bring it
to the meeting and "demo" what little there is at the moment.

Edupage, a summary of news items on information technology, is provided
three times each week as a service by Educom -- a Washington, D.C.-based
consortium of leading colleges and universities seeking to transform
education through the use of information technology. CYBERPHOBICS GALORE
A recent Gallup poll conducted for MCI shows almost half of the 600 white
collar respondents admitting they are cyberphobic or resistant to new
technology. More than a third do not use a computer at all, either at home
or at work, and nearly 60% don't use voice mail. Two thirds do not use
e-mail at work, and about the same number don't carry a pager. The most
common reason cited for anti-technology attitudes was a fear of loss of
privacy. Close runners up were worries over information overload and a fear
of losing face-to-face contact with associates. (Miami Herald 1/2/95 p.22) MORE INTERNET FACTS
Traffic on the NSFnet grew a whopping 110% in 1994, and the number of
countries online increased from approximately 137 in 1993 to approximately
159 this past year. There were 1,964 phone calls to InterNIC Registration
Services during November '94. For more facts, check out

"GIVE US YOUR MONEY, BUT KEEP YOUR OPINIONS TO YOURSELF!"
A survey of small business executives conducted for IBM by Roper Starch
Worldwide shows 65% of the respondents saying that building the information
highway is a good use of government funds, but only 3% think the government
should have "a lot" of influence on how the highway operates. Forty-four
percent felt the government should have no influence, and 49% said they
thought it should have "some" say in how things were run. (Inc. Technology
Premiere Issue p.19)
THE WIRED REVOLUTION
While saluting Wired magazine's worthy premise as a publication that
addresses the social and cultural effects of digital technologies, the
director of the 21st Century Project at the University of Texas blasts
Wired for its "fevered, adolescent consumerism, its proud display of empty
thoughts from a parade of smoke-shoveling celebrity pundits, its smug
disengagement from the thorny problems facing postindustrial societies, and
most annoyingly, its over-the-top narcissism. If this is the revolution, do
we really want to be part of it?" (New Republic 1/9-16/95 p.19)

@_subject: Remailer traffic loads? 
Is there someplace that remailer operators routinely post information
about traffic load?
The reason I ask is that this issue can have a bearing on selection of
remailers for chaining.  Using Raph's list, one can gather an approximate
feel for latency and reliability, but there is no way to know if a
site is forwarding hundreds or thousands of messages a day (which would be
good for traffic analysis), or just a few tens (which makes in/out analysis
much easier.)
Raph's list is a good 'reputation' system; however, it lacks this one bit
of info which would be immensely helpful.  Periodic postings of remailer
frequency usage to alt.privacy.anon-server by the operators would be one
way to propagate this info.
Of course, I may be overlooking something basic:  Would posting this info
pose any kind of security weakness?  I imagine not; if someone wants to get
this info for traffic analysis, they just watch the remailer for a day or

@_subject: Another problem w/Data Havens... 
It just occurred to me when reading this another method for ensuring the
"I can't tell what's in it" condition with a data haven operator.  Why not
use a secret sharing system where the contraband data is split into a number
of pieces and sent to different havens?  It could be argued that the individual
pieces are not the same as the whole, and there is absolutely no way the
operator could recover the original from a given piece (thus providing
plausible deniability.)
Using M by N secret sharing, with M < N, you build in some redundancy in case
one of the havens gets shutdown.
Ok, Eric, go ahead and blast your holes in this argument :)

@_subject: The Remailer Crisis 
I am currently using ISDN from my home in San Jose.  You're right in that the startup costs are the barrier--even a cheap single B channel (56K) terminal adapter for use with a serial port will run $300-$400
dollars.  The telco charges are minimal in my area; $25 monthly for
the line itself (115 Kbps async bandwidth).  Connect charges are free for non peak usage, and $0.60/hour for peak usage time (0800 to 1700) This is the Pacific Bell "Residential" ISDN plan.  For business lines,
it goes up to $50 monthly with $0.60/hour 24 hours a day.
In addition to this would apply any standard long distance charges that
would apply to a particular call.
This is an excellent setup for fast, cheap, INTERMITTENT connection to the Internet.  My particular ISP is in Santa Cruz, with POPS in SC, SJ,
and soon Monterey.  An unlimited connect time PPP account runs $75 monthly.
This actually gets me a three bit subnet so that I can put five IP boxes and an ISDN router on my ethernet at home.
A remailer in this scenario would need to have their MX record point to
their ISP, and process mail via POP (incoming) and SMTP (outgoing).  It would be straightforward to implement a timed or demand dial scenario (say, every fifteen minutes) to accomplish this.  While not the ideal (continuous internet connection with pure SMTP based mail transport), it
would suffice for a moderately loaded remailer, I'd imagine.
Of course, this involves the mail subsystem of your ISP, partially
defeating the purpose of having ubiquitous anonymous remailer "instances"
whose operation is outside the control of an ISP.  Still, it would be
a good start.

Well, yes, this is true.  My point was that reliable, fast, easy to use
bandwidth on the order of 128 Kbps is available now in some areas for
relatively cheap rates.  _With the condition_ that continuous access
is not necessary to run a remailer (as I had outlined), this could prove
to be a good jumping off ground for some remailer operators.  Sheesh, I could start my own on my home ethernet if I were so inclined.
The solution to the access fee problem is, of course, sharing that fee with
other payees.  Your example of putting boxes directly on TLG's network
is a good example of this.  We don't disagree here; we are solving two different problems it appears.

@_subject: Remailers-in-a-box 
Someone had posted a protocol scheme that would allow new remailers to
advertise their existence on a newsgroup, which would cause any number
of auto pinging "reputation" services to begin monitoring this new
remailer automatically.  Once reliability, etc., was established, the
reputation services would "add" this node to the remailernet.  Similar
actions would take place if a remailer just "went away".
Quality of service, features, etc., would be part of the advertisement,
and would result in a form of competition between remailers.  Similarly,
reputation services would have differing criteria for "blessing" a site,
which would result in a form of competition between the _reputation servers_
for a good reputation.
The key to this whole scheme is in the automation of the process.  Done
correctly, it would result in a self-organizing, self-healing ecology of
remailers, that would naturally gravitate toward providing the features
and services in most demand.
Yeah, sure.  Looks good on paper, anyway.  Lots of real-life hassles to work out, but it _probably_ could be made to work.
