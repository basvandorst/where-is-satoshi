then it was worth, yet you still hear about people wanting to figure out
One way would be to perform cooperative billing balances between nodes,
and allow each node to 'bill upward'.   This means that any two machines
are more interested in their relative balance than how much money they
are really spending.   There are some interesting problems of trust and
reliability, that might be solved through the use of digital money.
Then there is the wiley programmer (or machine) that applies expert
solutions to the problem trying to 'route' around billing imbalances.
With sophisticated enough algorithms such machines would be basically
trading on billing futures, perhaps demonstrating that computers could
be better capitalists than people.
Imagine a communications network that collapses because of an economic
Would the internet require the equivalent of suspension of programmed

IP/FP and PC1 describe how to get from input bytes to L, R, C and D Blocks:
The Initial Permutation
The Initial Permuation (IP) is a description of how a byte wide interface is
connected to a 64 bit block comprised of two 32 bit blocks (L and R).  Consider
a byte wide interface with the bits numbered 1-8.  The event numbered bits
go to the L Block and the odd numbered bits go to the R block.  Note that the
bit order is big endian, where bit 1 is most significant and bit 8 is least
least significant.  The input block is typically loaded as 8 successive byte Port    MSB7     Input  (LR)                     Left

The Final Permutation
The Final Permutation (IP-1) provides the inverse, it standarizes the output
of the R16L16 output block to a byte wide interface.  The Output block is
ordered Right then Left to allow complementary operation for subsequent
decryption.  Were one to perform an IP followed by IP-1 without any intervening
round iteration operations, one would end up with odd and even bits swapped:

In the simplest hardware implementation of DES, the Left and Right blocks are
comprised in hardware of four 8 bit register each.  Each 8 bit register can be
serially loaded (IP), serially unloaded (IP-1), or parallel output and parallel
loaded (round interation).  DES is an encryption algorithm originally required
to be implemented in hardware, specified in 1977 - predating 16 or 32 bit
microprocessor peripherals.
Permuted Choice 1
PC1 performs a similar function loading the C and D 28 bit registers (comprised
of three 8 bit bidirectional shift register and 1 4 bit bidirectional shift
register, all with parallel outputs).  The C and D registers can be serially
loaded (shifting right), or serially shifted left or right in a closed ring
for encryption or decryption.

Intel produces a random generator (in a chip package) that is used
in STU-II..'s.  You can't buy such devices, random sources good enough
to be used for initialization for military grade cryptography are Controlled
Cryptographic Items.
One would think that the NSA is attempting to exploit the lack of availability
of random initialization values against their targets.  The question becomes
one of whether or not the general populace (of the U.S.) is considered a
potential target, or simply casualties of the situation in undeclared        As a minimum one could infer that the availability of random numbers is
considered quite important for NSA secure communications.  I used to work
at a company that subscribed to NSA (National Standards Association) which
provided government and other standards on microfiche and/or hardcopy.
There was an interval before Reagan took office when the NSA provided all
of their unclassified standards into general availability, an era of open-
ness that came to an end with the Star Wars era.  One of those standards
was for random data sources.  The only recent standards that come to mind
are the X.509 stuff for session key generation, FIPS PUB 140-1 which
describes randomizer tests, and the recent FIPS PUB for a password generator.
These three use block ciphers to produce psuedo-random output. If NSA requires real stochastic results for military crypto, what would
we as casual cryptographers feel comfortable with?  The Netscape episode
shows the comfort level needs improving.
How good is good enough?

It was written to go with a paper on DES Hardware I'm putting the
finishing touches on.  Note that this site requires a password to
belong to group ftpsec to download.
It will encrypt in 47 clocks (8 IP, 29 Key Schedule, 8 FP) or
decrypt in 46 clocks (28 Key Schedule), and will fit in some of
the larger FPGAs.
The paper, when finished, will describe various performance enhancements
such as double buffered IP and FP (which is covered by an Ultron patent,
although probably invalid), direct key schedule  (16 clocks), or
superscalar DES (approaching 1 clock per 64 bit block).
For any hardware wonks, this is done in Synopsys VSS, although the
README file contains enough information for other VHDL implmentations.
There are also 4 or 5 'C' programs for generating VHDL files of the
S Boxes in various configurations, and a sample 'C' DES program done
in 1988 for the original UNIX libdes (source included).  The 'C' program
can be used to generate equivalent structures for debugging your own
DES hardware variations.
The test vectors are from NBS Special Pub 500-20 (circa 1978).

It was originally called FIREFLY or somesuch thing.  I may have some of
the early papers.  (The same ones leading to the statement in the book).
This should predate the STU-II to STU-III transition.

This is the earliest reference I know of to government public key cryptography,
and I was under the impression this was where the reference in Gus Simmons
book came from.

Sad to think that the undersecretary for defense who used to have
oversight of the NRO is now the Secretary of Defense.
One would guess he is trying not to pick up any bricks right now
