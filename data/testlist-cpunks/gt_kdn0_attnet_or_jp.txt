I just want to comment on this, as this is one of my pet peeves.
There are universally valid truths.  You implicitly admit so by
stating "...at most, one religion is correct".
The problem is we can not always determine what the universally valid
truth is (especially so in moral/religious matters), so we tend to
cop-out and say there are no truths, or something along the lines of:
"Well, that might be right for you, but not for me." or the one I love to hate:
"Perception is reality."
If Gump knew C:
"Momma always said life is like chocolates = chocolates++, you never know what you're gonna get."

Simple.  Let us consider all religions:
Now, here are our possibilities:
1.  All are right
2.  One or more is right, the remaining are wrong
3.  None are right
One of these possibilities must be true, but we can not know which one.
(This is why "at most" is the very phrase that implictly admits there
must be some universal truth concerning the validity of religions)
Please see above. Not knowing something does not mean it does not exist.
You are too quick to argue.  The statement that there must be some
universal truth even if we can not know what it is seems quite accepting
of the limits of human perception.
Simple.  A man may perceive he can fly unassisted.  However, once he
steps off the building the universal truth of gravity takes hold of his

A minor nit on an otherwise excellent post:
I am of the understanding the proper name is "The War of Northern
Aggression". :)

@_subject: New crypto regulations 
Concerning the new crypto regulations:
" Note to paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section: A printed
book or other printed material setting forth encryption source code
is not itself subject to the EAR (see Sec. 734.3(b)(2)). However,
notwithstanding Sec. 734.3(b)(2), encryption source code in
electronic form or media (e.g., computer diskette or CD ROM) remains
subject to the EAR (see Sec. 734.3(b)(3))."
This is a big question for me.  How does the fact that the same exact
information, when stored on magnetic media, cause it to lose its
freedom of press protection?
Has magnetic media never been tested in court for freedom of press
applicability?  What are the laws that outline the differences between
magnetic media and printed media?  Specifically, the one(s) that
permit the non-protection of magnetic media?
Does this mean that if a journal published an article on some strong
non-key escrow encryption algorithm that included source code, it
could not later offer that same article on a CD-ROM collection?  or
provide that same source code online?

I have been thinking on this. The government obviously does not want strong crypto in the hands of
 the public.  I see no reason why they will stop at the current
 legislation.
(1)  The ban on crypto source is extended to printed media.
(2)  The ban on crypto source in magnetic media is tested in court and
struck down as a violation of freedom of press/speech.
I still have enough faith to believe that (1) is unlikely.  What are the odds on (2)?  (I can't imagine it being upheld)
What are other alternatives?
(I am of the opinon that the "non-OCR-able" font scheme is unlikely.)
Also, what qualifies as "encryption" here?  Basic implementation of an algorithm?  Full-blown programs? Hash functions?  Steganography
 (with/without additional encryption)?  Data after a CTRL-Z?  (Sorry,
couldn't help it)

Is the "RSA in 3 lines of Perl" a munition (under ITAR)?
What if I got it as a tatoo?  - 2[b]||!2[b], what's the question? It's a tautology!

Apparently intimidated by the response from the Cypherpunks
 list, DataETRsch has begun spamming mailing lists with ads for their
 UDCM/IMDMP Windows DLL. It reared its ugly head in
 linux-c-programming at vger.rutgers.edu today.

Thus sprach Frank Willoughby :
Syncronsys [sp?] Software is the maker of SoftRam95, a program that
 supposedly doubled your memory through memory compression and other
 quasi-magical means. It was later revealed that not only did it not
 work as advertised, but it actually did not do anything at all
 (except display graphs indicating non-existant improvements).  IIRC,
 they lost a class action suit over this issue.
I would trust an encryption program relased to the public by the NSA
 more than anything these charlatans released.
I consider PGP to be robust, easy-to-use (with some front-end
 assistance), and secure.  However, I am by no means an authority on
 crypto.
