Those bullet points are far more likely to be brought up at trial than any
of the security properties of OTR. Defense counsel has to weigh the benefits
of presenting evidence -- will it get some point across, or will it be lost
on the judge/jury?
I submit that a military judge or a panel of commissioned officers (and
maybe some enlisted personnel) is unlikely to appreciate the finer
mathematical points, and more likely to fall back on "but there are these
logs, right there, and the feds say they're authentic." The defense has
plenty of Lamo's own documented actions to use to undermine his credibility.
There's much to be said for "baffle them with bullshit" (not that there's
necessarily any bullshit even involved), but a jury that doesn't understand
an argument is likely to dismiss it as bullshit.

There already are options on bitcoins.  [1] nominally
supports them in its order book, though I see little use so far [2].
Apparently someone wrote a put for 100BTC at a strike price of
$0.75/BTC with a 1.50BTC premium two months ago, maturing 31 May 2011
[3]; the option did in fact sell but I have no idea whether it was
exercised. Bitcoin calls have been around on the forum since at least
January [4], complete with risk reversal strategies ([5] is a textbook
example of a collar though not a zero-premium one).

seL4 has had readily available code for quite some time now, although
it's under a tl;dr "Non-Commercial License Agreement" that
differentiates itself from open source.
 It's unfortunate, but
it's also par for the course with a lot of academic code. The article
does make it sound like a better license is coming, though.
I'm not surprised that DARPA was first in line for a productized
verified microkernel. Software verification has been a high priority
for DoD since there was software -- it's why the Ada programming
language was developed in the first place. Turns out nobody likes
programming in Ada if they can help it, so DoD is turning to academia
and industry to satisfy the need for verifiability. (Full disclosure:
one of my projects is currently funded under the DARPA Cyber Fast
Track program, and is GPLv2. The software I'm producing is related to
verifiability, and could in fact be used to help secure drones -- but
it can also be used to help secure web servers, end-user applications,
pretty much any software that talks to other software. seL4 is even
more generally useful than that.)
The good news about a verified microkernel, at least, is that you
*can* be assured of whether there's a backdoor in it. (Provided you,
or someone, are able to express that as a formal property and verify
it with a [machine-assisted] proof, that is. I think it's reasonable
to expect the developers of said kernel to provide that proof.)
