Not at all.  I *did* look it up.  Technically, you are correct - but that
marriage is recorded by no government agency, you won't find it in any
public records - hell, if you still file 'single' on your tax return, who's
going to know?  You can just walk away - and if your spouse agrees with
you, you *can*.  I'm not talking about 'what would do in court' - I'm
talking real life.
How do I know?  I'm an ex-cop.  I worked on one of those 'common law'
marriage cases.
