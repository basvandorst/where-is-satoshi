Simple, the average shuck does not have the backbone to stand up for something he/she thinks is full of garbage.
They would rather let the bullshit slide than to make an issue of it, and risk being ostersized or worse.
Peace and Tranqility are what people want, not truth(which is relative) and freedom(which is not).
I guess I should clarify the distiction.  Truth is subjective, there are many things I think are true, but I can't prove them beond a shadow af a doubt.
Absolute freedom is easy, it boils down to one simple question.  "Can I do what ever I want".  If the answer is yes, I am free, if the answer is no, I am not free.
