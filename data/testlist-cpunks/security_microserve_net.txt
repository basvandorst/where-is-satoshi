If this was my personal box and we were bullshitting, that would be funny.
On the other hand, I have to address this matter.  Do you have a .forward
file in your other box?  How else are they getting your mail?

I just read the headers on the previous message, and boy, do I feel
like a fucking idiot. It was a forgery!
  Boy, sometimes I'm just dumber than a sackful of hammers.
  Hold on, while I check the headers on _this_ message.
  Damn! This one's a forgery, too.
  Now I feel really, really, stupid..._writing_ a forged message.
  I'm going to go sit in a corner, and hit my dick with a hammer.
