@_subject: future existence of free remailers? 
Please excuse me if this has already been discussed... but... What about
the trend of busting the sysops of bbs'? The recent Fidonet bust in Italy
seems to support this trend. It sounds to me like any remailers remailing
illegal stuff may get caught in the dragnet.

Things are more like they used to be than they are now.

Interesting. So if the carrier is ignorant, they're off the hook?
Thanks for the welcome. I've been lurking, but hadn't had the opportunity
to make any comments before, and it looks like this point wasn't much of a
point anyway. :-)
back to lurk mode.

I'm taking the liberty of forwarding this note here because email to
jdblair at rogue.cas.muohio.EDU bounces so I couldn't thank John or ask for
permission. It was the only reply I got, but I think it is really
interesting so...
