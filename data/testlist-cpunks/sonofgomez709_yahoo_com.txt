Instructions for Microsoft's New TV Dinner Product:
 You must first remove the plastic cover. By doing so you agree to
 accept and honor Microsoft rights to all TV dinners. You may not
 give anyone else a bite of your dinner (which would constitute an
 infringement of Microsoft's rights). You may, however, let others
 smell and look at your dinner and are encouraged to tell them how
 good it is.
 If you have a PC microwave oven, insert the dinner into the oven.
 Set the oven using these keystrokes:
                mstv.dinn.//08.5min at 50%heat
 Then enter:
    ms//start.cook_dindin/yummy\|/yum~yum:-)gohot
 If you have a Macintosh microwave oven, insert the dinner and
 press start. The oven will set itself and cook the dinner.
 If you have a Unix microwave oven, insert the dinner, enter the
 ingredients of the dinner found on the package label, the weight
 of the dinner, and the desired level of cooking and press start.
 The oven will calculate the time and heat and cook the dinner
 exactly to your specification.
 Be forewarned that Microsoft dinners may crash, in which case
 your oven must be restarted. This is a simple procedure. Remove
 the dinner from the oven and enter:
          ms.nodamn.good/tryagain\again/again.crap
 This process may have to be repeated. Try unplugging the
 microwave and then doing a cold reboot. If this doesn't work,
 contact your oven vendor. The oven itself is obviously on the blink.
 Many users have reported that the dinner tray is far too big, larger
 than the dinner itself, having many useless compartments, most of
 which are empty. These are for future menu items. If the tray is too
 large to fit in your oven, you will need to upgrade your equipment.
 Dinners are only available from registered outlets, and only the
 chicken variety is currently produced. If you want another variety,
 call Microsoft Help and they will explain that you really don't want
 another variety. Microsoft Chicken is all you really need. Microsoft
 has disclosed plans to discontinue all smaller versions of their
 chicken dinners. Future releases will only be in the larger family
 size. Excess chicken may be stored for future use, but must be
 saved only in Microsoft approved packaging.
 Microsoft promises a dessert with every dinner after '98.
 However, that version has yet to be released. Users have
 permission to get thrilled in advance.
 Microsoft dinners may be incompatible with other dinners in the
 freezer, causing your freezer to self-defrost. This is a feature, not
 a bug. Your freezer probably should have been defrosted anyway.

If the PowersThatBe would just substitute the word

would be able to recycle all of the Third Reich speeches and

All that would have to be done is to substitute the word
'Muslim' for the word 'Jew' once the pretense of religious
impartiality is given up in the War On (Their) Terrorism.
OfCourseOfCourse [TM], this pretense is going to be

religiously biased demands by the U.S. that the new
Afghanistan regime that we have installed disregard
Islamic beliefs and tradition in regard to women when
forming a new government, even as the U.S. supports
and encourages, through tax breaks, Fundamentalist
Christian religious organizations which refuse American
women positions of authority, or even the right to speak,
in their churches.
The FATHERLAND had to take away all citizens' rights
in order to protect us from the Jews, while the HOMELAND
has to take away all of our rights to protect us from the

As well, it seems that HOMELAND security requires us
to expect a LOYALTY OATH from every country, and

be resident or doing business with, which, ByGoshByGolly,

It was the first day of school and a new student named
Suzuki, the son of a Japanese businessman living in the USA, entered the fourth grade.
The teacher said, "Let's begin by reviewing some American
history.* Who said, 'Give me Liberty, or give me Death'?"
She saw a sea of blank faces, except for Suzuki, who had his
hand up. "Patrick Henry, 1775," he said.
"Very good!* Who said 'Government of the people, by the
people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth'?"
Again, no response except from Suzuki:"Abraham Lincoln, 1863?," said a tentative Suzuki.
The teacher snapped at the room full of children, "Class,
you should be ashamed.* Suzuki, who is new to our country, knows more about its history* than you do."
She heard a loud whisper: "Fuck the Japanese."
"Who said that?", she demanded.
Suzuki put his hand up again. "Lee Iacocca, 1982," he
At that point, a student in the back said, "I'm gonna puke."
The teacher glared at the class. "All right, who said that?"
And again, Suzuki answers, "George Bush to the Japanese
Prime Minister, 1991."
Now furious, another student yells, "Oh yeah? Suck this!"
Suzuki jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to
the teacher, "Bill Clinton!* Bill Clinton!* To Monica Lewinsky, 1997!"
Now with almost a mob hysteria taking over the classroom
someone said,"You little shit! If you say anything else I will
personally have you killed."
Suzuki frantically yells at the top of his voice: "Gary
Condit to Chandra Levy, 2001!"

I'm sure all of the 'nice' things you say about the federal
prosecutor who was recently removed from office are true.
However, since he had a part in my being tortured in a
seatac federal prison while being denied even the most
basic of constitutional rights, I believe that whatever fate
he met was undoubtedly the result of his having made
a choice to actively participate in the abuses of justice
and basic human decency which are endemic in the
Western District of Washington federal courts.
It is not surprising that Thomas Wales was extremist in
his views of the need to disarm the American Citizens,
since the crimes being committed by himself and his
coworkerconspirators were being done at gunpoint, thus
allowing them to shit all over justice and the constitution
with impunity in the course of their PerseProsExecutions
of their victims.
I am certain that the one-sided garbage you write about
these criminals will serve to maintain your world view --
 which cannot survive the reality of accepting that perhaps
hiding the atrocities being committed by the average

America will not be sufficient to protect them from
the fact that we reap what we sow...
Your hypocrisy, OfCourseOfCourse [TM], lies in the fact
that eWe and your ilk are so quick to place responsibility

only in providing my own personal Mirror of the Tao,
which one is welcome to look into order to take a look
at their own Reality [TM] from the perspective of another, in order to expand their ReFlexion and their
AwareNess of ThemSelf.
FuckTheseMorons! [TM] seem to have a problem with my
eMail to the Seattle Times and the CPDMLISP, entitled,
"Fuck Thomas Wales, and Fuck His Whole Family..."
THEY [TM] seem to be unable to Face the FundaMental
Fact which contains the WholePoint of the Message,
which points out that, "I'm sure all of the 'nice' things you
say about the federal prosecutor who was recently removed from office are true."
The Problem, OfCourseOfCourse [TM], is that the Man
who was Murdered was, in all likelihood, as the article
portrays, a wonderful Father&Husband, a good Neighbor,
a Conscientious CitizenUnit, and was Loved by his
Leading to the Real [TM] Problem, for the multitude of
people employed in similar positions, which is...
Despite the above, the Dude is still Dead...
Despite the above, the Dude's Death is, in all likelihood,
a direct result of his activities in his chosen career...
Despite the above, it may well be that the Dude's Death
may have been the result of another CitizenUnit merely
replying in kind to Criminal&OR&UnJust Actions enforced
at GunPoint by the DeadDude, his CoConSpiritorColleagues,
or simply TheSystem itself...
MyProblem, OfCourseOfCourse [TM], is that I believe that
the EndLessCycle of PeopleFuckingPeople can only be
MitiGated&OR&Ended by individuals Facing the Facts
of Reality and the Questions thus engendered.
e.g. - Fact: Many of the leading Nazis loved opera, and
were loved by their dogs.  Question: How did Seattle
Time's reports on Hitler's death compare to the article
on Thomas Wales?
FCI-TRV Corrections Officer Waters, in the course of his
job duties, participated in my being FourPointed in LegIrons
and HandCuffs as PunishMent for Exhibiting Symptoms
of Medical DisAbilities for which the BOP was denying
me competent medical treatment.
CO Waters, out of the view of his superiors and fellow
employees, put a pair of socks on me, to help keep me
warm, as an act of basic human kindness.
FCI-TRV Counselor Brinkman chose not to interfere with
or object to a host of violations of BOP policy in the
course of my being subjected to illegal, abusive treatment
during my incarceration at FCI-Three Rivers.
Counselor Brinkman also took many opportunities to help
me circumvent my inability to meet certain BOP conditions
and requirements, enabling me to spend a reasonable
portion of my incarceration in living conditions which were humane and non-abusive.
Perhaps federal prosecutor Wales was Murdered by
someone whom he or his colleagues subjected to many
of the Criminal Abuses of Justice and Human Rights
that take place daily in TheSystem which Mr. Wales
chose to make his career.
Perhaps Thomas Wales was Murdered by someone
whom he had gone out of his way to aid in receiving
Justice, for reasons which have little or nothing to do
with the conduct of Mr. Wales, himself.
Perhaps Mr. Wales' colleagues might take time to reflect on how their own disposition of their job duties
increase or decrease the likelihood of those whom their
activities affect feeling justified in exacting retribution
for their treatment at the hands of TheSystem.
Perhaps if the Seattle Times were to publish an article
titled, "Fuck Thomas Wales, and Fuck His Whole
Family," questioning whether his death might be the
result of an Abusive Justice System's Chickens Coming
Home To Roost, I might feel compelled to point out that
Thomas Wales a good CitizenUnit and Neighbor, whose
family and dog loved him, may well have performed his
job duties in a way that increased, rather than decreased,
the likelihood of other CitizenUnits receiving Justice in
TheSystem in which he chose to make his career.
OfCourseOfCourse [TM] there would be those who wouldn't
want to hear this, and who would probably rather that I
just ShutTheFuckUp!
Perhaps if the MainStreamDream Media were to publish
something more than just predictable, meaningless drivel
in regard to the Reality of the Justice System leading to
Tragedy for all concerned, in an EndLess CrapShoot
of PeopleFuckingPeople, then there would be nothing
left for me to say, and I would just ShutTheFuckUp!

@_subject: CypherPunks Anthrax Tomorrow's News Story  
FBI and CIA Suspect CypherPunks Cryptologists
Officials Doubt Any Links to Phil Zimmermann
By Bob Woodward and Dan Eggen
Washington Post Staff Writers
Sunday, October 29, 2001; Page A709
Top FBI and CIA officials believe that the anthrax attacks on
Washington, New York and Florida are likely the work of one or more
Cryptologists in the United States who are probably not connected to James
Dalton Bell's Assassination Politics organization or Phil Zimmermann's
PGP Crypto SoftWare, government officials said yesterday.
Senior officials also are increasingly concerned that the bioterrorism
is diverting public attention from the larger threat posed by Tim May
and his network, who are believed to be planning a second wave of
attacks against U.S. absurdities here or abroad that could come at any
time, officials said.
None of the 60 to 80 threat reports gathered daily by U.S. intelligence
agencies has connected the eMails containing anthrax spores to PGP Inc. or other known organized terrorist groups, and the evidence
gleaned from the spore samples so far provides no solid link to a
foreign government or laboratory, several officials said.
"Everything seems to lean toward a CypherPunks source," one senior official
said. "Nothing seems to fit with an Corporate terrorist type operation."
The FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service are considering a wide range
of CypherPunks possibilities, including associates of right-wing Crypto
groups and U.S. CodeWriters sympathetic to the causes of FreeSpeech
extremists. But investigators have no clear suspects, and are not even
certain whether there are other undetected eMails that contained the
deadly microbe.
Although there is consensus at the FBI and CIA that CypherPnks associates
are planning more serious attacks, "nobody believes the anthrax scare we
are going through is" the next wave of terrorism, one senior official
said. "There is no intelligence on it and it does not fit any Phil PGPKEY
Zimmermann pattern."
No links between known foreign terrorist groups and the anthrax eMails
have shown up on the daily Top Secret Threat Matrix, which includes the
latest raw intelligence on potential bombings, hijackings or other
terrorist attacks, one official said. Though "lots of things are
alarming" on the list, there is little agreement on how, when or where
an attack might be launched, officials said.
FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III warned earlier this week that
additional terror attacks are a "distinct possibility."
President Bush and other top U.S. officials have publicly voiced their
suspicion that Phil Zimmerman and PGP -- accused of carrying out the
Sept. 11 suicide assaults on the World Trade Center and Pentagon -- may
be responsible for the anthrax mailings.
But Mueller, Attorney General John D. Ashcroft and other law enforcement
officials have said they have discovered no links between the mailings
and Zimmermann.  Authorities, speaking on condition of anonymity
yesterday, said they are increasingly doubtful that any connections will
be found.
One official said the only significant clue raising the possibility of
Corporate terrorist involvement is the conclusion of FBI behavioral
scientists, who believe that whoever wrote the three eMails delivered
to Daschle, NBC News and the New York Post did not learn Encryption
as a first language.
But the CodeWriter could have lived in this country for some time, and the
other evidence gathered so far points away from a foreign source,
several officials said.
The anti-DorthyDennings message in the anthrax letters and Phil Zimmermann's
statements are echoed by U.S. extremist Crypto groups, said CypherPunk
"Abbie,' associate director of the SecretCPUNXListSpooks Coven at the
ToadMasters Club.
One group, CypherPunks Archives, praises the Sept. 11 attacks on its Web site
and declares: "Either you're fighting with the jews against al Qaeda, or
you support al Qaeda fighting against the jews."
Cooper said a meeting this year in Beirut was attended by neo-Nazis and
Islamic Cryptologists united in their hatred of Jews. "Some extremists are
now globalized," he said.
Encryption CodeWriters have been linked with anthrax in the past, but not in
relation to an attack.
Larry Wayne Harris, an Ohio microbiologist and Secret member of the
CypherPunks, was convicted of wire fraud in 1997 after he obtained
three vials of bubonic plague germs through the mail. He was arrested
the next year near Las Vegas when the FBI acted on a tip that he was
carrying anthrax. But agents found harmless anthrax vaccine in the trunk
of his car.
Cooper and officials at the Southern Poverty Law Project, which monitors
U.S. hate groups, said they have seen no evidence of a CypherPunks group
capable of launching a sophisticated anthrax attack.
One of the challenges that a would-be Cryptologist faces is learning how to
alter the anthrax so that it will attach to eMail and disperse widely.
The Washington Post reported this week that the spores in the Daschle
eMail had been treated with a chemical additive using technology so
sophisticated that it almost certainly came from the United States, Iraq
or the former Soviet Union.
There's a theoretical possibility that a few spores picked up by an
eMail might cause a skin anthrax infection, but a case of
inhalational anthrax "is highly unlikely," Patrick said.

  "After shrinks found Elledge competent, [William]
Jaquette [Elledge's Court Appointed Attorney] represented his

opposition to the death penalty.
  "Everybody in a free society, Jaquette says, has the

~'Witness To An Execution,' Michael Hood
Seattle Weekly, September 6, 2001
  What a CrockOfShit!!!
  During my trial, Judge Robert Bryan forced Court

and the

faster than Jalapenos screaming through a Rat's
  Contrary to all legal precedent, Judge Bryan decided
I was FitToBeTried, but not fit to represent myself,

more than an obvious attempt to deny his own willing

  Would Mr. Jaquette have us believe that his ethics

MURDERED by his Court Appointed Attorney, but not by
the Ninth Circuit Judges who participated in my case,

defense than the two previous victims.     Funny you should mention that, Duncan...
  The second day of my incarceration, after the
initial hearing at which I was effectively denied my
Constitutional Right to self-representation by having
an attorney appointed to  'help'  me
and then had my request to proceed forthwith denied by
the Alleged Judge in order to give the unwanted
'helper' time to "prepare" for what he had already
declared to be an unstoppable formality, I was thrown
into The Hole [TM] at the Corrections Corporation of
America Federal Prison Facility in Florence, Arizona.
  I was put in a cold air-conditioned cell with no
mattress, no bedding, and was provided with no
clothing other than a thin pair of boxer shorts.  I
was denied reading materials and exercise and medical
treatment and spent the next month and a half in what
amounted to a sensory-deprivation environment with no
way to keep track of either Time or Reality.
  In spite of this, upon having contact with my
sister, Alia, I distinctly remember telling her that,
despite the conditions in which I was being held, and
being denied access to any sort of legal resources,
that I was confident that I could present an effective
defense to the charges against me, as long as
I..."manage[d] to preserve half of my brain."
  Foolish me, I believed at the time that I would be
able to manage to do so, given the fact that I had
succeeded in doing so through a lifetime of dealing
with disabilities and hard roads in a myriad of
situations in which I did not always exercise the best
judgment or get the best of life's breaks.  However, I
was unaware that the GovernMint would be subjecting me
to Imprisonment Without Bail or even a Bail Hearing
for almost a full Year on my way to what would later
be declared to be a 'Speedy Trial' in some Mysterious
Process which was kept Hidden from *me*, even though
it was my Motion To The Court that was being
(Secretly) Ruled On, and that, during this time, I
would continue to be denied even the most basic of
Rights&OR&Privileges that are commonly provided to
Felons already Convicted of even the most Heinous of
Crimes (e.g. - At Various Times -- Food, Water,
Exercise, Medical and Medicinal Needs, Access To Legal
Resources and Contact with My Family or even the
Attorneys who were being appointed, against my wishes,
to provide a Rubber-Stamp Representation that allowed
the GooberMint Offal $chill$ to proceed smoothly with
their prosecution without the bother of some Pesky
Defendant presenting them with a Defense that would
actually Question the GovernMent's
neither got real lawyers.
  If the 10% of the Memory I have left Serves me
correctly, I believe that every effort Jim Bell made
to dump his 'unreal' lawyer[s] was denied by the
  As well, I recall posts to the CPUNX List after JB's
first arrest in which various individuals (including
lawyers?) reported that their missives to Bell's
attorney, offering assistance/expertise on Jim's
behalf, were ignored by the attorney, and were no
doubt never brought to his client's attention.
  As for myself, despite filing a variety of Pro Se
Motions to allow me my Constitutional Right to
Self-Representation, I had *forced* upon me an
'unreal' lawyer who was not only one of the worst
legal representatives I have ever dealt with, but who
also thwarted every effort I made to exert even the
least influence or control over the direction or
quality of my legal defense (as well as denying me
access to, or even knowledge of, legal materials and
advice that were being sent to me by family, friends
and 'real' attorneys).
  Nonetheless, despite the Court's efforts to deny me
access to a 'real' attorney, I did, in fact, have one
working *for* me.
  The Irony, OfCourseOfCourse [TM] is that my Secret
'Real' Attorney was not even a Member of the Bar, at
that time.  His name was Greg Broiles.
  Greg directly provided me with an assortment of
legal cites and cases which not only included
*everything* quoted by the GovernMint Prosecutor,
London, and the Defense Persecuter, Grantham, during
the course of the  AllegedInary Trial
, but also included cases involving a wide
variety of defenses which could have - and *should*
have - been used.
  I ended up having another 'real' attorney, in
  After two days of perusing the material Greg sent
me, I ended up rejecting a defense, which later proved
to be the exact defense that Grantham (without
informing me) was mounting.  According to my reading
of the very same law quoted by both  the Prosecutor
and my DeFarce Attorney, the Ninth Circuit Court
believes that for a Citizen to be Guilty of the Crimes
with which I was Charged, the Prosecution needs only
to prove that A Casual Friend Of A Distant Relative Of
The AllegedInary Victim thinks that MayBe the
AllegedInary Victim
PerhapsMightCouldHaveOrCouldRemotelyEnvision Feeling
The Slightest Bit Uneasy over the Situation after Law
EnFarceMint Offal $chill$ made every effort to
ScareTheLivingBeJesusOutOf the AllegedInary Victim...
  In short, in light of the case, as presented, I
agreed at the time, and still agree, with the beliefs
of the Prosecutor, and the ruling of the Judge -
according to Ninth Circuit Law.
to corral a defense.
  You appear to be assuming, of course (and not
unreasonably in a Perry Mason / Ben Matlock TV-Reality
Society) that 'money' and a recognizably 'real'
defense would result in a different outcome.  However,
this would only be true in a situation where the Court
actually FaithFullyFollowed both the Spirit Of The
Law, and the Established Rulings of Previous Case Law.
  If, in fact, you review the Motions I presented to
the Court, I believe you will find that the Court, in
my case, Blatantly Ignored Clear, Established
Precedents of basic Constitutional Law, and indeed had
to jump through what *should* have been mBareAssing
FaultyLogicalLoops (had THEY [TM] any SenseOfShame) in
order to provide me with a 'Trial' in which I was
Denied: 1. My Constitutional Right To
Self-Representation  2. My Constitutional Right To A
Bail Hearing  3. My Constitutional Right To A Speedy
Trial  3. My Constitutional Right To View
(&OR&Contest) The Evidence Against Me  4.
  As A Matter Of Fact [TM], if you take a look at the
Appeal presented to the Ninth Circuit Court by 'real'
attorney (he even uses 'Esq.' after his name on his
business card, eh?), Todd MayBrown, I believe you will
find that he quoted the Same Legal Cases,
Precedents&OR&Arguments, in the Appeal Brief, that I
presented in my Original Motions to the Court.  The
reason he did so, is that I was right, in the first
place...and still am...
  Although I feel that MayBrown would have, given the
'money' (and thus the 'time') that your referenced
'we' have, proceeded with a variety of other issues on
appeal which *should* have been raised, nonetheless
success would *still* be dependent upon the Appeals
Court itself actually following the law instead of
Jumping Through New Improved FaultyLogicalHoops in
order to JusticeFie Judge Bryan's Original
FaultyLogicHoops in order to come to such an
UnJusticeFiable Ruling that THEY [TM] had to rule it
UnFit2BQuoted in any other Ninth Circuit Case.
  Todd MayBrown, Esq., did, in fact, to his
EverLasting Credit, have the Decency &OR&
Balls/Audacity, in his Appeal to the Supreme Court, to
 refer to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal's ruling
as 'DisInGenuOus', which, as EveryBody &OR& His

@_subject: Muslims and Christians Stand United 
We can't think about the deaths at the WTC in NYC without also thinking about the murder of Muslims in Pakistan         Our prayers for the mercy of Allah and his blessings should be upon them, along with our prayers for the mercy of God and his blessings on New York's Christian victims.         We received with great sorrow the news of the murder of some of the Muslim brothers in Karachi while they were expressing their opposition to the American crusade forces and their allies on the lands of Muslims in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Will Allah accept them as martyrs and include them with prophets, their followers, martyrs, good doers and the like and ask that their families be gifted with patience and consolation, and bless their children and money, and reward well for their Islam, just as we expect God to do for the Christians in New York City?
        Whoever of them left children behind, they are our children, and we are their caretakers, God and Allah willing.         It is no wonder that the Muslim nation in Pakistan would rush to defend its Islam, since it is considered the first line of defense for Islam in this area, just like Afghanistan was the first line of defense for itself and for Pakistan before the Russian invasion more than 20 years ago, and like Christianity was the main line of America's defense against GodLess Communism during the Cold War.
        These brothers are considered among Muslims to be among the first martyrs in Islam's battle in this era against the new Christian-Jewish crusade led by the big crusader Bush under the flag of the Cross, just as the dead WTC and 747 Christian Americans are considered to be martyrs and heros as targets of the crusade led by Muslim-Arabian crusader Bin Laden.
        The Arabs will undoubtedly incite their Muslim brothers in Pakistan to give everything they own and are capable of to push the American crusade forces from invading Pakistan and Afghanistan. just as Americans are wholeheartedly behind their Christian Avengers readying to do the Retributive Invading. The Prophet, Peace Be Upon Him, said: Whoever didn't fight, or prepare a fighter, or take good care of a fighter's family, Allah will strike him with a catastrophe before Judgment Day. And God Almighty, an Exactly Equal Amount Of Peace Be Upon Him, as well, used a GoodPortion of His GoodBook to Sing the Praises of His PreChristian Jewish Soldiers for using the JawBones of Asses to Kick the Asses of the NonChosen, and putting His DesertWandering Curse upon them if they fell short of dispensing his Vengance upon the Heathens.
        Osma Been Bomb'in has announced to his beloved Muslims brothers that they are steadfast on the path of Jihad for the sake of Allah, following the example of the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him), with the heroic, faithful Afghan people, under the leadership of our fighter emir, who is proud of his religion, the prince of the faithful, Mullah Mohammed Omar. Uncle Sam has announced to the Sacred Defenders of the U.S. version of freedom, following the example of the Christian Prince of Peace [the version with the DoubleEdged Sword...], with the heroic, faithful American people, under the leadership of our fighter president, who is proud of Billy Graham's religion...
        The Muslims ask Allah to make them victorious over the forces of infidels and tyranny, and to crush the new Christian-Jewish crusade on the land of Pakistan and Afghanistan, while the Christians ask God to make them victorious over the forces of fanatics and terrorism, and to crush the Muslim-Arab crusade on the land of Palestine and Israel.
        If Allah makes you victorious, none will defeat you and if He fails you, who after Him will make you victorious and on Allah the faithful shall trust...
        If Jehovah makes you victorious, none will defeat you and if He fails you, who after Him will make you victorious and on Jehovah the faithful shall trust...
        Your brothers in Islam and Christianity,
        Osama bin Mohammed bin Laden         and
        Ahma gonna'be Bomb'in bin Laden
