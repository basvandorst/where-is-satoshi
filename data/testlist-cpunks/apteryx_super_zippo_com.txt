It's in the same directory as PGP, which will be the directory
referenced by the SET PGPPATH statement in the autoexec.bat file if
PGP is installed and configured correctly. At least with version
2.6.2. You can use MyName="any string of characters that is specific
enough to identify one and only one key". I have mine set as my name,
so that no matter what e-mail address I use, PGP uses the right key.
You keep using that word, I dunna think it means what you think it means.

@_subject: A New Crypto Announcement--Could be Ominous 
It sure looks like it, the following quotes from CNN's web page:  make it pretty clear that US government-approved export of strong
cryptography is part of the announcement. What else could it be except
gak? "If the encryption technology has won the backing of industry and the
U.S. and other governments -- which Hewlett-Packard officials say is
the case -- the development could eliminate a key obstacle to the
growth of electronic commerce via the Internet. "
"The technology will make it possible to export products containing
so-called "strong encryption," which have not been exportable under
national security laws dating back to the Cold War. "

erm, a boycott means not _buying_ a product, as opposed to not _using_ a
product. In the case of PGP, I never intended to purchase it from RSA. As
for Netscape, there are other browsers out there (or so I heard). Realistically, a boycott is likely to be ineffective. Writing letters to
companies and congresshmucks and working with non-US crypto companies to
create a standard that can be legally imported into the US (for now) would
be more effective, IMHO. Boycotts rely on large numbers of participants,
and not enough people understand or care about encryption. We'd be better
off trying to change that first.

Oh my, you mean diffferent sides of a controverial topic are saying
different things? What's a po reporter to do? Translation: I'm a lazy journalist who considers any controversy that
requires more than just asking the two sides about it as too complicated to
understand, and my editor wants me to dumb everything down anyway.
I guess it is hard to turn a large number of mathematical, technical, legal
and philosophical issues into no more than 3-syllable words, 15 word
sentences, 5 line paragraphs filling 1 column of a magazine. Maybe this reporter should have viewed the article on lattice crypto in The
Economist a couple of months back It's not impossible to explain the basic
issues at stake if you are willing to do some research and not insult the
intelligence of your audience. Of course, Time would be unlikely to print such an article that precludes
the semi-literate from understanding it. Besides which, I'm sure that there
is something *important* happening to Brad Pitt or Julia Roberts that needs
to be covered first.

@_subject: Why not PGP? 
Does this mean that exporting Private Idaho, PGPfront, WinPGP, etc. would
be a violation of ITAR because they function only when combined with PGP
and contain "hooks" for using PGP?
I don't recall any restrictions on who could download these files from
their host sites.
You keep using that word, I dunna think it means what you think it means.
