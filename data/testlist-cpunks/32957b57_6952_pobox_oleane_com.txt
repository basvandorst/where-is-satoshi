@_subject: [TARGET ACQUIRED] Cryptography in France 
Not all issues.. France is not in the Dark ages in matters of computer
smarts or network connectivity, but...
...but yeah, we suffered from the Minitel at the same time that BBSes
were flourishing in the US. Calling the Minitel a sub-Prodigy-class
system is, believe me, an insult to Prodigy. The Minitel transmitted at
75 bps in one direction and 300 bps in the other, and -you had guessed
it- it was only a matter of state-monopoly France Telecom wanting to
make more money whereas they had the technical knowledge to implement a
much better system. The Minitel did nothing but delay the arrival of the
Internet and other PC-based networks, setting networking in France
several years back in terms of technicality and economic opportunity.
Don't let this fool you.. A LOT of net users in France do not have the
".fr" domain. There is quite a number of ".com" and ".net" French users
on the Internet. And I am a living example of the fact (this is my real
address up there, not a US-based remailer).
This is sad, because this is true. Which was all the reason why I wrote
the original message in that thread.
Why? It is probably easier to implement crypto anarchy in other, more
fertile grounds, but the question is, is it more _useful_ ?
