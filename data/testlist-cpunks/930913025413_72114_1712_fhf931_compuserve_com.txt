the everybody: I'm working on a windows shell for PGP, as well as a
pgp.dll for filemanager extensions and supporting drag and drop
encryption.  I say, give me about 1 month or so (I've got a app to deliver
for my real job too) and I'll have stuff that's ready to be tested.  I'll
start accpeting beta test volunteers now if anybody wants to speak up.
