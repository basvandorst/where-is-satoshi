(Thread start:
Agreed, great news.
In hindsight, it is clear that we as a community have an interest to
build a resource of amicus curiae briefs - friend of the court briefs.
So PLEASE make moves in the direction of contributing and collecting
documents which may be relevant to future cases - at the least a
simple collection of legal docs.
We have an interest in protecting our free-speech networks (Tor, I2P
etc), legally as well as technologically and politically. The
Torproject.org website does a good job IMHO of presenting the social
case for free-speech networks.
No matter the circumstances of a particular case (a particular free
speech node operator), we the global free-speech promoting and
free-speech facilitating community, have an interest to advise the
courts regarding matters of technology and free speech, in order to
maximise the sanity of the outcomes brought about by our courts (and
yes, another operators courts are as good as mine, in terms of global
impact). For example a tor-network node operator charged for actual
illegal activity, should not cause legal suppression of free-speech
networks in general.
To kick things off, here's the gist of what I have in mind (this is in
no way directly responsive to the case that started this thread, which
I know nothing about):
In this matter an individual has been charged with a [criminal] offence.
The case of a matter of an individual committing a proven criminal
defamation or incitement must not be used by the court to suppress
free speech generally by way of the court's power of judicial
Similarly in this case the [Defendant] was the operator of a 'digital
communications facility' which facility was a node in a free-speech
network, in particular the [Tor|I2P} free speech network;
where the operator is found by this court to have committed unlawful
acts, then this court must only  target those unlawful acts when it
makes its determinations, by way of this court's power of judicial
sanction exercised according to law;
and this court must not reach beyond those unlawful acts in its
determinations/ rulings/ sanctions;
if the court exercises its power in reaching beyond those unlawful
acts then such exercise of judicial power is likely to undermine
confidence in the court by all other operators of the free-speech
network and by users of the free speech network.
A ruling by this court will be seen by many humans around the world,
both operators of free speech nodes in the free speech networks, as
well as by users and by potential users of free speech networks around
the world.
In this case, the rulings of this court are visible globally, and
shall be watched by many;
there is therefore a great burden upon this court in this case, and
this court therefore has a special duty of care when it makes its
rulings/ determinations, to be conservative and cautious, in
particular regarding any general deterrents this court might
ordinarily be minded to create by its rulings which deterrents might
unintentionally dampen confidence in this court and/ or confidence in
the courts generally to protect our human rights including freedom of
This court must be especially careful in its rulings in this matter,
since the court is in a position to bring about chilling effects upon
the liberties of not only those humans within its immediate
jurisdictions, but also upon the broader global community.
(A glosary, localisation, much enhancement and other legal polishing
would be required of course, along with subroutined/ separate
submissions regarding each relevant law, and regarding each relevant
precedent in the jurisdiction in question and/ or in jurisdictions
relevant (some cases/precedents are so poignant, so timeless, that
they apply all over the world, e.g. the Credit River Decision, as well
as the trial of William Penn).)
Such advice or briefs to the court are ideally tailored to each
particular country/jurisdiction.
However, even a brief prepared for some country other than the country
at issue, is likely to be useful to those attempting to create a brief
for a particular case in another country, and may even be directly
useful as a filing in its own right, at least if the language is the
same :)
Regarding the filing of briefs, we need standing to file; that is, we
need an interest in the matter which interest is seen by the court.
In some countries particular organisations may be ideal for the filing
of such briefs, such as the FSF and EFF (USA) and EFA (Australia).
In other countries, if there is no directly applicable organisation,
then a "designated representative of the Torproject" who is resident
in that country, may have standing to make such a filing.
Alternatively, a local human-rights-friendly politician may be
amenable to making the filing on behalf of their constituent(s)
(that's us).
Finally, in general any individual should have standing to make such a
filing, since we have an interest in our own human rights - free
speech is a fundamental human right - so we should also aim for the
preparation and collection of briefs file-able by ourselves.
Take notice, we HAVE A DUTY OF CARE to each other, and to the broader
community, to contact Torproject and/ or others in this community, if
ever we find ourselves in a court case involving the operation of any
free speech network node (I2P, Tor, exit or relay), in order that
those in the community who have an interest, ie the rest of us (at
least those of us in the same country), are given the opportunity to
make our interest known to the respective court(s) in that
jurisdiction, by way of filing appropriate and standardized briefs.

As has been said over the decades: start correct, 'good' easy
to maintain code, secure of course, and optimize later,
eg 1-1 mapping from XMPP (XML I assume?) to say msgpack:
MessagePack:  - a fast, binary replacement for JSON
Such optimizations ought be behind a library anyway!
(From user app point of view.)
As someone else said, think of the stack, separate the concerns:
IP, user addressing, persistence of ids, persistence of addresses,
crypting, dht, distributed storage, libs, user apps.

References: There was Groklaw, but that is no more.
I have presumed in the past that certain "groundwork" work might be
useful for those involved in cases.
However, pre-emptive action is difficult due to the number of
jurisdictions. Groklaw built on the SCO case, which was a) widely
reported, b) struck at the heart of the free/libre software world, c)
involved big budged companies, d) continued for a very long time.
A very valuable literary-legal resource was created by that effort
(other cases were covered to some degrees).
I would discourage self-represented defence in cases surrounding
Tor/I2P etc, due to the potential significance of adverse consequences
to the broader *globabl* free-speech network communities!
Self-represented may be ok in conjunction with support from
pro-liberty lawyers. This might be quite jurisdiction-sensitive, I
don't know.
But first and foremost, we have a duty of care to each other in this
freedom-speech community, to not hide such cases from those who would
be able to support, due to the potential community chilling effects.
SO, such a list might be a very useful thing to set up, so that those
who might "valantly" charge ahead in a case self-representing, might
receive the support and the cautions from supportive lawyers regarding
all possible approaches, etc, etc.

There are two types of 'registration' of militia which may be useful
to consider - that by government (state or federal) and that by notice
given to government (probably to state and to federal) of the
body-of-people created by that body-of-people and named a "militia".
Begging the elected machinery to do the bidding may be successful.
Legal notice of actions on foot and of a reality "hereby established
by the people of REGION and formed as a militia in the meaning of the
federal constitution and in the name of NAME" gives notice of a (newly
created) reality.
We the people are with the right to petition our parliaments, but even
further, to give notice to the parliaments. The right to act pursuant
to our governing instruments, the constitution at the foundation (at
least in the USA), and to give notice of the formation of
body-of-people pursuant to those governing instruments, perhaps out be
exercised with caution and discretion, where the power of the people
is expanding, and where such exercise of such power might be seen as
interesting by our governments.
Legal notice, at various stages of entity-body-of-people creation,
with appropriate time frames for suitable response and ongoing
communication, engages those external government authorities in a way
which can create entitlement for, by, and of, the people. Sanction of
the force of numbers would likely also be needed to establish such
right as the right to bear (any and all) arms by an established
Such creations would of course require united intention of many of
we-the-people, over an extended period of time, along with a
willingness to handle the responses from the wider public and of the
various governments, at least state and federal.

@_subject: Warrant Canaries 
References: Whoa there cowboy!
IANAL but the common law is pretty clear: you cannot compel
performance (in general that is, certain writs excepted of course).
Now the rest is my unpacking, and a bit of ranting, and I realise you
added "IANAL", but if you're thin skinned, stop reading now and go to
law school (you need to).
When you use the phrase "You cannot change your behavior in any way",
you are speaking to acting, and leading the reader to presume an
"unlawfully demonstrative" action on the part of the actor; this is an
entirely different slant to that presumed by the warrant canary: that
is, performing lawful actions during a period of time, and later
ceasing to act or ceasing to do that thing. Ceasing to do something,
is lack of performance, which is entirely different legal territory to
acting, or performing an act.
In common law (in general), you cannot compel me to act, to perform
some action. Let's say we put up a web cam in an office across the
street from my office, and each morning I wave from my office at that
webcam - this could be my 'canary' for my "private email" customers.
Can a court (that is, lawfully), order that I wave out my office
window, in exactly the same manner as I have been doing for the last
three years, at exactly the same time, wearing exactly the same
clothes and same hairstyle (let's say I have been shaving my head). So
now, my shirt gets stained ("accidentally" of course:) with tomato
sauce, I miss my barbershop appointment for a few weeks, so my hair
grows, my razor stops working, so I can't shave and I grow a beard and
mustache, I'm really tired each day now, so I wave more slowly than I
used to, I also look subtly sad/happy compared to normal, and, oh how
could it have happened, the rent for my office doesn't get paid, and I
get an eviction notice, so sad, so sad, I can no longer wave out my
office window each morning.
How the FUCK is a court going to order me around to stop every one of
these "variations" in my "behaviour"?!! Are you serious when you say a
jury would convict me of unlawful non-behaviour? Or that a court is
going to order that I behave in precisely these
Please!! Some people might be so stupid as to soak up such rubbish,
but I have some hope that not everyone is so dum/ uncreative as to
swallow such bullshit.
Secondly, when you say "...in any way that a jury could judge...", I
am reminded of one (USA) phrase to describe juries as "the gang of 12"
- a "gang" referring, AIUI, to the relative unpredictability of the
outcome one might get - but this has a very positive side, refer in
particular to the Trial of William Penn and Bushel's Case:
In the hindsight of the Trial of William Penn and Bushel's Case, one
might be inclined to consider such "random" legal outcomes from the
so-called "gang" of 12, to instead be rare "bastions of sanity"
(verdicts) from the "final stronghold of justice" (jury/"gang" of 12)!
Our language is somewhat required (for communication that is) on this
list or elsewhere; it is a tool - one we may use for good or for evil
(choose your definition, I won't argue your definition, although it
might not match mine).
Subtleties of implication, nuance of unspoken presumptions, leading
statements and questions, can lead the uninformed reader to thoughts
or (worse) conclusions, which thoughts and conclusions are most
definitely NOT in our interest!
Please, THINK before you type.
Thanks :)

Look (at least some of) the folks around here have a second brain
cell, some even have third.
You say you are a journalist, you say you are an activist, you say you
worked in the middle east, you say all sorts of things.
To me (TM) you're blowing your trumpet excessively. Once is ok, but to
keep blowing your own trumpet, over and over again - as in, repeatedly
- you know, more than once, carries implications; the exact
implications will vary by listener and are likely -not- what you want
arising within your reader's' minds.
You also keep 'pushing' your journalistic 'cred' rather than spend
that small effort to push the SHIFT key to capitalise your sentences
and names - that's disrespectful or at least lazy. Some of us make the
effort for you, yet you fail to return that courtesy. And a bloody
small courtesy it is four a journalist.
Ah ... who's making the big deal? Hmm...
Listen I don't hold anything against you, I don't know you and I've
been assuming ever since I first saw your emails on this list that you
are posting with a fake name. I do know it's hard to see oneself - in
the hindsight of reading my own emails after the fact I have
embarrassed myself too many times, so I empathise with your plight.
Pottle, meet ket :/
Given your loud self proclamations I suggest raising -your- tone. I
would appreciate that.
Secondly consider letting your work do the speaking for you. We have
these little things called hyperlinks, which look somewhat like this:
- such a link in your email footer would allow those who would bother
to verify about you for themselves without your dismal trumpet
practice getting in the way. That's a win win, especially for you.
Thirdly show a little respect to the people you write about (in email)
and press the SHIFT key at the same time as you type the first letter
of each name you type.
Fourthly if your intention is to demonstrate consideration to your
readers then also press that SHIFT key simultaneously to pressing the
first letter of the first word of each sentence (these are usually the
ones coming after a period).
Fifthly raise your own tone; those with that second or third brain
cell I spoke of can see black kettles for what they are - screeching
about that from the stove top is not becoming for a so called
'journalist'. Not in the slightest. Did I mention anything about
dignity? Well it's about your own behaviour not what others say.
Problem with said screeching is sometimes 'you' mistake a beautiful
silver carafe temporarily placed on the stove next to you, for a nasty
black kettle; others see the silver carafe and cover their ears from
the "BLACK KETTLE! BLACK KETTLE!" screeching; you start looking
distinctly pot like and rather black.
By the way that's not a good look - I can vouch for this from painful
first hand experience :P
A single rule for self which may work for you (or not, I dunno) is
'assume good intent'. When someone challenges self, perhaps self needs
a challenge. When someone calls self a black kettle perhaps a little
polishing of self is needed, a rib extraction, that sort of thing. And
if your assumption is wrong and bad intent is coming atcha, then at
least you've taken that polishing your act opportunity and look a
little shinier to onlookers.
THAT's what some call a win win situation :D
Good luck fellow human,

Assuming you define TBB as semi-good crypto, the block AIUI to Mozilla
incorporating Tor plugins/ mods into Firefox by default is simply that
the Tor network cannot scale Internet wide. Yet. Because of course you
know then we'd all be secure.
But what do you define as semi-good crypto?
Agreed. But they might give some dollars for shiny new handset.
You think you think? Bah! Thinking's overrated.
Because there's no such thing as "truly secure" and marketing to the
"I want it truly secure" crowd would likely result in deception, which
due to the overly paranoid nature of such crowd, would quickly
deconstruct the bullshit anywya.
Making a lot of assumptions there - such as "there are few enough
politicians who are compromised (with sex or money), that the rest can
stand strong in the face of the few".  Although the very recent French
and Italian delegations to Crimea suggest at least some are capable of
on the ground analysis in the face of the rest of their respective
parliaments. Who knows, next we might see Greece running a referendum
so the people can decide what their government should be doi... oh,
hang on...
And a way to get rid of those compromising images held by their
respective national governments...
Of course! We've all missed that obvious for so long - put JVM in a
secure open source hypervisor and the world will be safe. That would
even encourage me to be less sarcastic.
Perhaps Google could kick this project off - they already own Android
and they must have the dollars. In fact Intel could produce the CPU,
Foxconn can build the handsets, Google can install the software and
the NSA can deliver them to us^B^B^B sorry, the Postal Service can

trust. Trust. But not without money. More money. And technology.

a much more useful approach to (pick an adjective of) comedy in most
In general, and for most people, yes.
For many years we have occasionally seen large endowments (in the
order of say $1 million USD) to fund developers for this or that.
A lurking thought for me is that this money could fund say one house,
and the interest on the remainder could pay for rates, internet and
electricity. Then somebody could live in that house, and grow their
food, and have most of their time for programming without having to
find rent each week. Yes some money is still needed, but a lot less
than in a "normal rental" situation.
There might be better futures still of course - this has just been a
self posed question of "how can we harness resources better in
general, so our results/ efforts are more long lasting".
Exchange of human energy using money as facilitator is the extremely
dominant reality right now, so we must work with it.
One of the greatest insights into "a new reality" that the Free
Software movement shows us (as compared with traditional capitalism)
is that many of us humans like to contribute their talents and skills
back to the community and don't require proprietary land and profit
maximisation. Many of course are happy to develop libre software for a
wage, some "hard core" programmers have sacrificed significant
monetary income in order to build something truly free and community
based - witness Paul Davis of ardour.org fame, and Tom Lord's arch
version control back in the day - these and others have made personal
sacrifices which very few ordinarily would.
So how might we expand the comfort zone for those willing to make some
sacrifices? What other transitions (slow movement away from base
capitalism) might make sense?
Thanks again,

This might seem horribly political and non-cp to some, but a good some
of it seems on topic to me. Perhaps ignore that which you consider
"A man, who has in mind an apparent advantage and promptly proceeds to
dissociate this from the question of what is right, shows himself to
be mistaken and immoral.  Such a standpoint is the parent of
assassinations, poisonings, forged wills, thefts, malversations of
public money, and the ruinous exploitation of provincials and Roman
citizens alike.  Another result is passionate desire – desire for
excessive wealth, for un-endurable tyranny, and ultimately for the
despotic seizure of free states.  These desires are the most horrible
and repulsive things imaginable.  The perverted intelligences of men,
who are animated by such feelings, are competent to understand the
material rewards, but not the penalties.  I do not mean penalties
established by law, for these they often escape.  I mean the most
terrible of all punishments:  their own degradation."
Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 B.C.)
I view the Australia of today as that of pre-war Nazi Germany;  the
truth is 'verboten' (forbidden).  Political correctness rules the
roost, truth suppressed.  When the absolutes of right and wrong, truth
and lies are abolished, usurped by political correctness, there is no
future for this country.  Politically enforced Multiculturalism will
be the means to its demise.  When Christianity is replaced by the evil
philosophy of 'Humanism", emanating from the equally evil United
Nations, normality will also be replaced by abnormality.  Right
becomes wrong and wrong becomes right.  That trend is now blatantly
obvious in the society of today.  Ironically passed into law by our
questionable legislators.  Sometime, somehow, someone will have to
answer for this warped minded, reverse thinking called:  political
Federal Parliament consists of traitors and cowards on both sides.
How else can one explain the state of Australia today?  Those who keep
silent under duress are moral cowards as in political correctness, the
suppression of the truth.  "Political correctness is the evident child
of communism.  The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie
became truth.  In times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes
a revolutionary act."  (George Orwell)  Political correctness defined.
Politically enforced multiculturalism can best be described as
meaningless.  When your country and its people have lost their
homogeneous status, your heritage and identity eliminated by
un-assimable, alien races, bringing their own cultures with them, the
country will become a nation of tribes, speaking many languages;
meaningless.  A nation can survive within its own heritage, language
and culture, but not without them.  The abolition of the White
Australia Policy sounded the death knell for Australia.  "Ask not for
whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee, Australia, it tolls for thee",
In a court of law, a person had to swear on the Bible to tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  I pose the
question, would the misuse of the word 'gay' be accepted as truth?
Would the legislators consider that before making a decision on the
issue?  I consider it to be Karl Marx dialectics, "words I choose all
mixed up in a devilish muddle so that anyone can choose to believe
whatever they choose to believe".  Discrimination for choice, racist
for patriot etc., right and wrong are absolutes and no political
correctness can alter that fact.  I hope the legislators are cognisant
of the word gay.  The dictionary defines it as "light-hearted,
mirthful, showy, dissolute".  "Dissolute as loose living, debauched".
Is that the kind of society that political correctness may impose and
enforce upon the people?
For people smugglers, read the United Nations, it is the intention of
that commo dominated organisation to recolonise the world.  The
Humanist Manifesto is the bible of the United Nations, it states, "We
deplore the division of humankind on nationalistic grounds.  We have
reached a turning point in human history when the best option is to
transcend the limits on national sovereignty".  'Humanism' was
declared to be a religion by the Supreme Court of the USA in 1961.
The bible has been banned in American Courts.  The United Nations
Charter for World Government states:  "Increasing self-denial in the
exercise of sovereignty by the state, necessary for the better working
of the United Nations." The evil ideology of humanism is being
implemented by the UN.  The United Nations Charter for World
Government is based on treason.  All governments that participate in
its agenda, are traitors to their own people and nation.
In Support of John Bushell, Network News, June.  I quite agree with
you and I also pray:
Wait, wait, wait
Before the golden gate,
I leave behind my hate
For the traitors of my state.

They'd go through the other gate,
Not to sit and dwell
But to burn in bloody hell.
Now you've heard of Guy Fawkes
And his gun powder plot,
I dreamt I was he
And blew up the lot.
Whatever legislators may pass into law, it must first pass my
conscience, whether to accept or reject it.  For my mind is my own, it
does not belong to legislators.  A mind that's forced against its will
is of the same opinion still.  We now live in an era of contradictions
of 'universal deceit', where right is now wrong and wrong is now
right.  We also have politically appointed but unelected commissions
to force this lunacy upon society.

Politicians who keep silent under duress are moral cowards.
"One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is, that

The following quotations are just a few reasons why Australia, as
such, is now in a state of decline and eventual genocide.  Bob Hawke
admitted:  "That the major parties had reached an implicit pact to
keep immigration off the political agenda."  Deceit and collusion.  He
later stated:  "Multiculturalism is not negotiable".  So much for
democracy.  Malcolm Fraser re:  the Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees,
"I did not put it to the people because I knew that they would reject
it."  Al Grassby:  "The White Australia Policy is dead, give me a
shovel and I will bury it".  These are just a few examples of a
deliberate intention to destroy traditional European Australia.
Manning Clarke:  "I believe very strongly that we must fight for the
end of the Anglo-Saxon domination of Australia".  These were the
preliminaries to the abolition of the White Australia Policy by Gough
Whitlam;  genocide of Australians.  Advance Australia Where?
Politically enforced multiculturalism can be defined in the word:  MEANINGLESS.
When your identity has been diluted to the extremity of genocide by
the political imposition of alien races upon the host nation,
Australia, then you arrive at the meaning of the word 'meaningless'.
"Pour your pitchers of wine into the wide river and where is your
wine?  You have only the river".  (Kath Walker, Aboriginal poet in
'The Dawn Is At Hand'.
Treason = Genocide:
Genocide;  a word of which the official United Nations definition is:
"The committing of acts with intent to destroy – wholly or in part, a
national ethnic, racial or religious groups as such".  The United
Nations Convention of asylum seekers (illegal arrivals), is in breach
of their own statement to that effect.  Imposing alien races of people
upon a stable, inherited, homogenous nation of people is tantamount to
genocide of the host nation.  Brutus, Gough Whitlam, is the architect
of the 'genocide' of the Australian nation of people.  Like Brutus, he
stabbed White Australia in the back and instituted the policy of
multiculturalism, i.e., genocide.  Gough Whitlam, during his lifetime,
was a Marxist Fabian (commo) as is most of the Labor Party, hiding
under the Labor Party banner.  Menzies wanted to ban the Communist
Party in Australia;  he was over-ruled by the High Court and a
subsequent referendum on the matter.  The Federal Governments of
Whitlam and Hawke, the Commos were not under the bed, they were in it,
working to destroy Australia.  While representing UNESCO in Paris,
Whitlam promoted the concept of UNESCO BROWN MAN.  The mixing of all
races of people, a race-less, stateless, faceless, brown slob, devoid
of all character or heritage, the future person of the United Nations
New World Order.

Who is behind the United Nations Power Grab?
A powerful network of Americans in government, business, academia and
the media, have conspired to empower the United Nations.  One
noteworthy 'insider' is David Rockefeller – head of the super-rich
family that donated the land for the UN headquarters.  He told an
elite group in Germany in 1991:  "We are grateful to the Washington
Post, the New York Times, Time magazine, whose directors have attended
our meetings and respected promises of discretion – for almost 40
years.  It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for
the world if we had been subject to publicity during those years.  But
the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a
world government."  Here is a sampling of what other globalists have

Why hasn’t she? More to the point, why won’t she allow the Swedish

@_subject: essential understanding - Kafkatrapping 
The points raised in this blog are essential in today's SJW/ "Social
Justice Warrior" (how politically correct that sounds) climate of
communication - the Kafkatrapping techniques described here may
provide an important "ahah!" moment to those who have been subjected
to such emotional/ linguistic constructs in the past, or who may have
to face such constructs in the future.
Here's to competently handling more of today's pervasive bullshit.
Posted on 2010-07-18 by Eric Raymond
Good causes sometimes have bad consequences. Blacks, women, and other
historical out-groups were right to demand equality before the law and
the full respect and liberties due to any member of our civilization;
but the tactics they used to “raise consciousness” have sometimes
veered into the creepy and pathological, borrowing the least sane
features of religious evangelism.
One very notable pathology is a form of argument that, reduced to
essence, runs like this: “Your refusal to acknowledge that you are
guilty of {sin,racism,sexism, homophobia,oppression…} confirms that
you are guilty of {sin,racism,sexism, homophobia,oppression…}.” I’ve
been presented with enough instances of this recently that I’ve
decided that it needs a name. I call this general style of argument
“kafkatrapping”, and the above the Model A kafkatrap. In this essay, I
will show that the kafkatrap is a form of argument that is so
fallacious and manipulative that those subjected to it are entitled to
reject it based entirely on the form of the argument, without
reference to whatever particular sin or thoughtcrime is being alleged.
I will also attempt to show that kafkatrapping is so self-destructive
to the causes that employ it that change activists should root it out
of their own speech and thoughts.
My reference, of course, is to Franz Kafka’s “The Trial”, in which the
protagonist Josef K. is accused of crimes the nature of which are
never actually specified, and enmeshed in a process designed to
degrade, humiliate, and destroy him whether or not he has in fact
committed any crime at all. The only way out of the trap is for him to
acquiesce in his own destruction; indeed, forcing him to that point of
acquiescence and the collapse of his will to live as a free human
being seems to be the only point of the process, if it has one at all.
This is almost exactly the way the kafkatrap operates in religious and
political argument. Real crimes – actual transgressions against
flesh-and-blood individuals – are generally not specified. The aim of
the kafkatrap is to produce a kind of free-floating guilt in the
subject, a conviction of sinfulness that can be manipulated by the
operator to make the subject say and do things that are convenient to
the operator’s personal, political, or religious goals. Ideally, the
subject will then internalize these demands, and then become complicit
in the kafkatrapping of others.
Sometimes the kafkatrap is presented in less direct forms. A common
variant, which I’ll call the Model C, is to assert something like
this: “Even if you do not feel yourself to be guilty of
{sin,racism,sexism, homophobia,oppression…}, you are guilty because
you have benefited from the
{sinful,racist,sexist,homophobic,oppressive,…} behavior of others in
the system.” The aim of the Model C is to induce the subject to
self-condemnation not on the basis of anything the individual subject
has actually done, but on the basis of choices by others which the
subject typically had no power to affect. The subject must at all
costs be prevented from noticing that it is not ultimately possible to
be responsible for the behavior of other free human beings.
A close variant of the model C is the model P: “Even if you do not
feel yourself to be guilty of {sin,racism,sexism,
homophobia,oppression…}, you are guilty because you have a privileged
position in the {sinful,racist,sexist,homophobic,oppressive,…}
system.” For the model P to work, the subject must be prevented from
noticing that the demand to self-condemn is not based on the subject’s
own actions or choices or feelings, but rather on an in-group
identification ascribed by the operator of the kafkatrap.
It is essential to the operation of all three of the variants of the
kafkatrap so far described that the subject’s attention be deflected
away from the fact that no wrongdoing by the subject, about which the
subject need feel personally guilty, has actually been specified. The
kafkatrapper’s objective is to hook into chronic self-doubt in the
subject and inflate it, in much the same way an emotional abuser
convinces a victim that the abuse is deserved – in fact, the mechanism
is identical. Thus kafkatrapping tends to work best on weak and
emotionally vulnerable personalities, and poorly on personalities with
a strong internalized ethos.
In addition, the success of a model P kafkatrap depends on the subject
not realizing that the group ascription pinned on by the operator can
be rejected. The subject must be prevented from asserting his or her
individuality and individual agency; better, the subject must be
convinced that asserting individuality is yet another demonstration of
denial and guilt. Need it be pointed out how ironic this is, given
that kafkatrappers (other than old-fashioned religious authoritarians)
generally claim to be against group stereotyping?
There are, of course, other variants. Consider the model S:
“Skepticism about any particular anecdotal account of
{sin,racism,sexism,homophobia,oppression,…}, or any attempt to deny
that the particular anecdote implies a systemic problem in which you
are one of the guilty parties, is itself sufficient to establish your
guilt.” Again, the common theme here is that questioning the discourse
that condemns you, condemns you. This variant differs from the model A
and model P in that a specific crime against an actual person usually
is in fact alleged. The operator of the kafkatrap relies on the
subject’s emotional revulsion against the crime to sweep away all
questions of representativeness and the basic fact that the subject
didn’t do it.
I’ll finish my catalog of variants with the verson of the kafkatrap
that I think is most likely to be deployed against this essay, the
Model L: “Your insistence on applying rational skepticism in
evaluating assertions of pervasive {sin,racism,sexism,homophobia,
oppression…} itself demonstrates that you are
{sinful,racist,sexist,homophobic,oppressive,…}.” This sounds much like
the Model S, except that we are back in the territory of unspecified
crime here. This version is not intended to induce guilt so much as it
is to serve as a flank guard for other forms of kafkatrapping. By
insisting that skepticism is evidence of an intention to cover up or
excuse thoughtcrime, kafkatrappers protect themselves from having
their methods or motives questioned and can get on with the serious
business of eradicating thoughtcrime.
Having shown how manipulative and psychologically abusive the
kafkatrap is, it may seem almost superfluous to observe that it is
logically fallacious as well. The particular species of fallacy is
sometimes called “panchreston”, an argument from which anything can be
deduced because it is not falsifiable. Notably, if the model A
kafkatrap is true, the world is divided into two kinds of people: (a)
those who admit they are guilty of thoughtcrime, and (b) those who are
guilty of thoughtcrime because they will not admit to being guilty of
thoughtcrime. No one can ever be innocent. The subject must be
prevented from noticing that this logic convicts and impeaches the
operator of the kafkatrap!
I hope it is clear by now that the particular flavor of thoughtcrime
alleged is irrelevant to understanding the operation of kafkatraps and
how to avoid being abused and manipulated by kafkatrappers. In times
past the kafkatrapper was usually a religious zealot; today, he or she
is just as likely to be advancing an ideology of racial, gender,
sexual-minority, or economic grievance. Whatever your opinion of any
of these causes in their ‘pure’ forms may be, there are reasons that
the employment of kafkatrapping is a sure sign of corruption.
The practice of kafkatrapping corrupts causes in many ways, some
obvious and some more subtle. The most obvious way is that abusive and
manipulative ways of controlling people tend to hollow out the causes
for which they are employed, smothering whatever worthy goals they may
have begun with and reducing them to vehicles for the attainment of
power and privilege over others.
A subtler form of corruption is that those who use kafkatraps in order
to manipulate others are prone to fall into them themselves. Becoming
unable to see out of the traps, their ability to communicate with and
engage anyone who has not fallen in becomes progressively more
damaged. At the extreme, such causes frequently become epistemically
closed, with a jargon and discourse so tightly wrapped around the
logical fallacies in the kafkatraps that their doctrine is largely
unintelligible to outsiders.
These are both good reasons for change activists to consider
kafkatraps a dangerous pathology that they should root out of their
own causes. But the best reason remains that kafkatrapping is wrong.
Especially, damningly wrong for anyone who claims to be operating in
the cause of freedom.
UPDATE: A commenter pointed out the Model D: “The act of demanding a
definition of {sin,racism,sexism,homophobia,oppression} that can be
consequentially checked and falsified proves you are
{sinful,racist,sexist, homophobic, oppressive}.”
UPDATE2: The Model M: “The act of arguing against the theory of
anti-{sin,racism,sexism,homophobia,oppression} demonstrates that you
are either {sinful,racist,sexist, homophobic, oppressive} or do not
understand the theory of
anti-{sin,racism,sexism,homophobia,oppression}, and your argument can
therefore be dismissed as either corrupt or incompetent.”
Model T: Designated victims of
{sin,racism,sexism,homophobia,oppression} who question any part of the
theory of {sin,racism,sexism,homophobia,oppression} demonstrate by
doing so that they are not authentic members of the victim class, so
their experience can be discounted and their thoughts dismissed as
internalized {sin,racism,sexism,homophobia,oppression}.

Leader’s letter helped ‘discover shadowy faces of terrorism’: American Analyst
IIT Exclusive News, Imam Ali Khamenei, Iran, Leaders of Ummah, Middle
East, North America
3 December 2015 10:10
An independent American analyst believes after Leader’s letter,
international public awareness would never allow governments to
support terrorism without impunity.
Anthony Cartalucci wrote to Payman Yazdani of Mehr News International
Service in an email interview about the recent and second letter by
the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei to
youth in Europe and the US, where he said the letter contributed to an
environment which would make public alert, who otherwise would only
watch passively their fellow governments’ nebulous acts in sponsoring
terrorism. Cartalucci also believed that the West had shifted the
blame to Islam and Islamic countries, since they saw clearly the
backlash of their own act in arming atrocious terrorists in Islamic
In his second letter to western youth, Ayatollah Khamenei has talked
about the terrorism and its roots. What is the significance of this
To solve any problem, one must first understand it fully. The problem
of terrorism has long been poorly understood by the majority of the
Western public, and even policymakers. Their inability to grasp the
true roots of terrorism have allowed it to flourish indefinitely.
For most in the West, the reality that special interests in their own
governments have created and perpetuated terrorism intentionally as a
geopolitical tool is incomprehensible. Unfortunately, it is also the
truth and until they grasp that, those behind the terrorism will have
a carte blanche to continue using it both at home and abroad, as a
proxy force of violence, and as a tool to create fear and coercion.
The wars, instability, growing domestic police states, distrust among
nations, and even within nations, among citizens, refugee crises, and
others all are wrought from the use of terrorism as a geopolitical
tool. Thus, it is at work within the heart of some of the most
pressing issues of our time.
The Leader has emphasized in his message that Islam is the religion of
peace; why do some try to introduce Islam as the religion of violence?
The majority who claim Islam is a religion of violence are merely
repeating witlessly propaganda they themselves heard. The source of
this propaganda are the same interests which themselves are driving
the violence – particularly the state sponsors of terrorism, the
United States, their Persian Gulf allies, NATO, and others.
By blaming Islam and appealing to both ignorance and bigotry which are
still deeply rooted in Western culture, these very interests feeding
the violence can deflect blame onto others – in this case, Muslim
nations and peoples. By appealing to ideology, rationality, history,
geopolitics, and critical thinking can be side-stepped and emotional
responses can easily be elicited.
Why would some try to make connections between Islam and terrorism
after any terrorist act happening around the world?
Again, it is a matter of deflecting responsibility by those who are
actually driving terrorism. The recent attacks in Paris were carried
out by terrorists the United States and its closest regional allies
have been arming, training, funding, and harboring for years now. All
of the attackers were well known to Western intelligence agencies. By
all indications, this attack should have been easily foiled by Western
security agencies, but it was not.
Conveniently, it was carried out on the eve of the Vienna talks on
Syria, and just as the West’s agenda in Syria began unraveling in the
face of a joint Syrian-Russian-Iranian alliance. Some would say this
was a little “too convenient.” Blaming the attacks on Islam is the
best way to appeal to people’s emotions directly, and hopefully
overwhelm their ability to critically think and ask just who really
benefited from the conveniently-timed attacks and why, again, Western
security agencies knew of the attackers beforehand but made no
attempts to stop them from carrying out their horrific acts of
What is the importance of this letter at this juncture?
The importance of this letter is that it adds to a growing body of
evidence and voices around the world speaking up and confronting state
sponsors of global terrorism. The constant efforts of those who know
the truth to inform those who yet do not, is having a gradual effect
on the special interests driving global terrorism. No longer are they
able to act with impunity. No longer are their attacks carried out
without many, if not a majority, suspecting the governments in the
West at least as equally as shadowy terrorist organizations.
It is important for this process, this dialogue to continue, to speak
to the truth with every opportunity and in every format, so that as
people begin to see the truth for themselves, they can also take note
of who has been saying it all along.

Are AirBnB, Uber and Homejoy examples of political anarchism

Are we seeing the ultimate in self responsibility (I would say self

How might we embrace such self responsibility, whilst also manifesting
collective empathy/ shared 'responsibility' (perhaps there's a better

Extremely apropos for me. Thank you. I am slowly learning little bits
of history.
It's ironic given the potential for influence he could have had at
that time, that he refused the Education Ministry on his welcome back
from exile, to Russia in 1917 after the February Revolution. Who knows
- perhaps he was told he could not rewrite the school curriculum to
inculcate a base of anarchist ideals? But we don't know his mind and
considerations at that time.
Some succinct snippets (to me):
"His enthusiasm for the changes happening in the Russian Empire turned
to disappointment when the Bolsheviks seized power in the October
Revolution. "This buries the revolution," he said.[22] He thought that
the Bolsheviks had shown how the revolution was not to be made; by
authoritarian rather than libertarian methods.[22] He had spoken out
against authoritarian socialism in his writings (for example The
Conquest of Bread), making the prediction that any state founded on
these principles would most likely see its own breakup and the
restoration of capitalism.[citation needed]"
"Kropotkin did not deny the presence of competitive urges in humans,
but did not see them as the driving force of history (as did
capitalists and social Darwinists).[39]:262 He did believe that at
times seeking out conflict proved socially beneficial, but only during
attempts to destroy unjust, authoritarian institutions such as the
State or the Church, which he saw as stifling human creativity and
freedom and impeding humans' instinctual drive towards sociality and
"With Mutual Aid especially, and later with Fields, Factories, and
Workshops, Kropotkin was able to move away from the absurdist
limitations of individual anarchism and no-laws anarchism that had
flourished during this period and provide instead a vision of communal

Feels like a sell out. I suspect he feels he's being pragmatic.
 Game for privacy is gone, mass surveillance is here to stay – Assange
on  panel
Published time: 10 Dec, 2015 18:13
Edited time: 11 Dec, 2015 03:16
Humanity has lost its battle for privacy and must now learn to live in
a world where mass surveillance is becoming cheaper for governments to
implement, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said during a panel
dedicated to RT’s 10th anniversary.
Assange addressed the panel on security and surveillance hosted by RT
in central Moscow on Thursday via videoconference from the Ecuadorian
embassy in London, where he has remained holed up for the last three
years in order to avoid extradition to Sweden.
When offered a chance to comment on the session’s topic – “Security or
Surveillance: Can the right to privacy and effective anti-terror
security coexist in the digital age?” – the whistleblower asked the
moderator, and host of The Big Picture Show on RT American, Thom
Hartmann: “How long have you got, Tom?” implying he has a lot to say
on the issue.
But it was Assange’s only joke during the event, as his reply turned
out to be gravely serious and in many respects depressing.
“In thinking about this issue I want to take quite a different
position, perhaps, from what you would expect me to have taken… I
think that we should understand that the game for privacy is gone.
It’s gone. The mass surveillance is here to stay,” he said.
Mass surveillance is already being implemented not only by major world
powers, but also by some medium and small-sized countries, he added.
“The Five Eyes intelligence arrangement [of Australia, Canada, New
Zealand, the UK and the US]… is so evasive in terms of mass
surveillance of domestic and international telecommunications that
while some experts can achieve practical privacy for themselves for
limited number of operations… it’s gone for the rest of the
populations,” the WikiLeaks founder stressed.
International terrorists are among those “experts” capable of making
their communications invisible for security agencies, he added.
Privacy “will not be coming back, short of a very regressive economic
collapse, which reduces the technological capacity of civilization,”
Assange said.
“The reason it will not come back is that the cost of engaging in mass
surveillance is decreasing by about 50 per cent every 18 months,
because it’s the underlying cost that’s predicated on the cost of
telecommunications, moving surveillance intercepts around and
computerization and storage – all those costs are decreasing much
faster at a geometric rate than the human population is increasing,”
he explained.
Mass surveillance and computerization are “winning” the competition
with humanity and human values and they’re “going to continue to win
at an ever-increasing rate. That’s the reality that we have to deal
with,” the WikiLeaks whistleblower added.
The focus should now switch from defending privacy to understanding
what kind of society will be built in these new, changed conditions,
he said.
The WikiLeaks founder reminded the panel of the historic examples of
East Germany and other societies, in which people adapted to living
under the scrutiny of the authorities.
“If you look at societal behavior in very conformist, small, isolated
societies with reduced social spaces – like Sweden, South Korea,
Okinawa in Japan and North Korea – then you’ll see that society
adapts. Everyone becomes incredibly timid, they start to use code
words; use a lot of subtext to try and sneak out your controversial
views,” he said.
According to Assange, the modern world is currently moving “towards
that kind of a society.”
Privacy is among values “that simply are unsustainable… in the face of
the reality of technological change; the reality of the deep state
with a military-industrial complex and the reality of Islamic
terrorism, which is legitimizing that sector in a way that it’s
behaving,” he stressed.
Assange encouraged those present on the panel as well as the general
public to “get on the other side of the debate where it’s going” and
stop holding on to privacy.
The panel discussion was part of an RT conference titled 'Information,
messages, politics:The shape-shifting powers of today's world.' The
meeting brought together politicians, foreign policy experts and media
executives from across the globe, among them former director of the US
Defense Intelligence Agency Michael Flynn, the Green Party’s Jill
Stein and former vice president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the
OSCE, Willy Wimmer.

I agree that the wording I chose for the subject could be seen as
divisive, yet is confronting since it suggests a specific target,
which target turns out to be "most people/sheeple".
The divisive part is not good, but also not intended.
The "we need to be alert to reality - this is big/bad" is intended and
I think is essential to assessing anything sane. I recall reading that
Wikipedia article a few years ago, yet it had no less impact upon me,
on my second reading.
No, not the compliance bit at least. Just because I speak arrogantly,
refused to wear a school uniform for -years- in a row and use
vehemence and confronting language when I communicate, does NOT mean I
am the cause of those "sheeple" who be compliance with mindless
You can't be seriously suggesting as much, surely.
In fact "sheep" is about as apt as it gets when describing compliant
(to arbitrary authority) people. And the Migram experiments show that
humans by an overwhelming majority, are in fact sheep, even in the
face of their own stress, their own tears, inner conflict, emotional
pain - they -still- fucking comply with arbitrary (worse, despotic!!)
"We humans" are so woefully inadequate to the task of complying with
our own conscience or inner sense of right and wrong, and so woefully
tied to compliance with external authority, it is shocking,
embarrassing, upsetting and yes, confronting.
But fuck, don't shoot the messenger!
Put your confronting reaction to something constructive - try to
figure out how to simply and expediently educate those you come across
to counter this problem - if you have actual successes, please share
those, as that may go some significant way to enlightening us all on
how to handle this very confronting problem.
Another shot to prod you along a bit further:
Those who are compliant with despotic external authority in the face
of their own inner conscience of right and wrong, ought be regarded as
other/ outer/ "them", and treated with extreme caution!
"Those" sheep happens to be about 60% to 90% of everyone! You wanna

You don't need to "find" me. My address is 9175 Kornbrust Circle, Lone

Luckily for you, there are daily DIRECT FLIGHTS from Heathrow to
Denver. Here's what you will need to do. After arriving at Denver and
passing through customs, you will need to catch the shuttle to the
rental car facility. Once in your rental car, take Pena Boulevard to
I-225 south. Proceed on I-225 south to I-25 south. Proceed south on
I-25 to Lincoln Avenue which is exit 193. Turn right (west) onto
Lincoln. Proceed west to the fourth light, and turn left (south) onto
Ridgegate Boulevard. Proceed south, through the roundabout to
Kornbrust Drive. Turn left onto Kornbrust Drive and then take an
immediate right onto Kornbrust Circle. I'm at 9175.
Just do me one favor. PLEASE wear body armor. I have some new
ammunition that I want to try out, and frankly, close-quarter body
shots without armor would feel almost unsporting from my perspective.
That and the fact that I'm probably carrying a good 50 I.Q. points on
you makes it morally incumbent upon me to spot you a tactical
However, being that you are a miserable, trembling coward, I realize
that you probably are incapable of actually following up on any of
your threats without losing control of your bowels and crapping your
pants while simultaneously sobbing yourself into hyperventilation. So,
how about this: why don't you contact the main mosque here in Denver
and see if some of the local musloids here in town would be willing to
carry out your attack for you?
After all, this is what your "perfect man" mohamed did (pig excrement
be upon him). You see, mohamed, being a miserable coward and a con
artist, would send other men into battle to fight on his behalf.
Mohamed would stay at the BACK of the pack and let the stupid,
ignorant suckers like you that he had conned into his political cult
do the actual fighting and dying. Mohamed would then fornicate with
the dead men's wives and children. You should follow mohamed's
example! Here is the contact info for the main mosque here in Denver :
Masjid Abu Bakr
Imam Karim Abu Zaid

Denver, CO 80231
Phone: 303-696-9800
Email: denvermosque at yahoo.com
I'm sure they would be delighted to hear from you. Frankly, I'm
terribly disappointed that not a SINGLE musloid here in the United
States has made ANY attempt to rape and behead me. But maybe I haven't
made myself clear enough, so let me do that right now.
I will NEVER, EVER, EVER submit to islam. I will fight islam with
every fiber of my being for as long as I live because islam is pure
satanic evil. If you are really serious about islam dominating the
United States and the world, you are going to have to come through me.
You are going to have to kill me. Good luck with that. And understand
that if you or some of your musloid boyfriends do actually manage to
kill me, The Final Crusade will officially commence five minutes
later, and then, despite your genetic mental retardation, you will be
made to understand with crystal clarity what the word "defeat" means.
Either way, I win, so come and get it.

be afraid of).

Thank you. Added to my to read list.
We're talking about the Milgram experiment - instructor (authority,
actor), teacher (the sheep), learner (electro shock pain receiver for
wrong answers, actor).
In this experiment, which was repeated numerous times, in various
countries, and even in recent times, in all cases the results have
been highly consistent, and includes examples of "teacher" (sheep) in
so much emotional stress that they would be crying, yet when prompted
with the 4 standard commands from the "instructor", would nearly
always go along, applying life threatening electric shocks to someone
they'd just met whom they knew had a heart condition.
My summary is woeful so read the wikipedia page, but the gist is the
relevant point - despite all sorts of responses from the
"teacher"/sheep which clearly indicate that they were experiencing
emotional stress, questioning/ challenging if they really should be
doing what they were being asked to do, crying, shaking uncontrollably
etc etc, in 60% to 90%+ of cases, the human sheep, with up to 4 simple
and escalating commands from the "external authority figure", submits
their own will/ "conscience" (call it what you like, but their
reactions demonstrate what I name as "conscience") to the will of the
"instructor authority" and continues to apply potentially lethal
electric shocks to the "learner with a heart condition".
The results speak for themselves!
The results speak for themselves. You keep apologising in subtle(?)
ways - "oh, it's only the most eager sociopaths" and "all the others
must have had some other disorders".
The results speak for themselves and speak very loudly - humans are
majorly missing some fundamental tools to handle despotic external
authority. These experiments were invented as the Nuremberg trials
were underway, in a specific attempt to understand/ comprehend the
defenses that the accused Nazis (military officers) on trial were
giving. The experiment verified that "yes, this -is- how humans act in
such situations".
This result doesn't need our qualification nor any apology! 'We' need
a solution to educating 'ourselves' - our 'fellow sheep'!
Please - "obviousness" is not a citation!
And then "we" all suffer your proposed "violent excesses of our
rulers" - what sort of solution is that?!!!
As history shows, not until WAY after its much too late to be relevant
to those who suffer the torture and or death arising from your stated
"violent excesses of our rulers".
Why do you keep qualifying this as though it's somehow "ok" and
"explainable" - are you proposing to remove the "reward" of all
salaries of all government employees? I'm sure Juan and I would agree
- but do you think that would be attainable? Right, just like before
Libya got blown up by the USA - refer Hillary "We came, we saw he
[Gaddafi] died" Clinton?
What do you mean by "this"?  I cannot comprehend this sentence.
That might be your idea.
Politics is a little about power, but more about authority -
exercising authority in the context of a shared common delusion of
"democracy" or whatever the regime of the day is spouting to its
And Milgram showed us definitively that most people are sheep who will
submit to any and every external authority firmly put to them (eg
verbally), right up to and including the point at which that sheep
will be applying deadly force to another "fellow sheep".
What do you mean by "work"?
Note to yourself - my definition of "works" may be different to yours.
These generalisms slow the conversation down.
Like ritual human sacrifice?
So your position is that Milgram, by doing his experiment, and
empirically showing us that humans are despotically submissive sheep,
is fundamentally being elitist?
Or pointing out Milgrim's result is elitist?
Or warning that a huge percentage of humans are despotically
submissive is elitist?
Or that this mass debate you're engaging in is your hissy fit over the
term "sheep" to describe humans? Humans as demonstrated to a shocking
degree by Milgram's experiments? In that case, the term sheep is
seriously understated!
How about this then eh:
Humans are breathing, eating, sleeping and shitting (BESS) drones,
easily caused to submit their wills to comply with external commands
and to do absolutely despotic acts; witness Milgram, witness Nuremberg
Humans, the BESS drones man, just the BESS!

Since its first spewing of volcanic ash has, in just FOUR DAYS,
NEGATED EVERY SINGLE EFFORT you have made in the past five years to
control CO2 emissions on our planet - all of you.
Of course, you know about this evil carbon dioxide that we are trying
to suppress - it's that vital chemical compound that every plant
requires to live and grow and to synthesize into oxygen for us humans
and all animal life. I know it's very disheartening to realize that
all of the carbon emission savings you have accomplished while
suffering the inconvenience and expense of driving Prius hybrids,
buying fabric grocery bags, sitting up till midnight to finish your

Well, all of those things you have done have all gone down the tubes
in just four days. The volcanic ash emitted into the Earth's
atmosphere in just four days - yes, FOUR DAYS - by that volcano in
Iceland has totally erased every single effort you have made to reduce
the evil beast, carbon. And there are around 200 active volcanoes on
the planet spewing out this crud at any one time - EVERY DAY.
I don't really want to rain on your parade too much, but I should
mention that when the volcano Mt Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines
in 1991, it spewed out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than
the entire human race had emitted in all its years on earth.   Yes,
folks, Mt Pinatubo was active for over One year - think about it.
Of course, I shouldn't spoil this 'touchy-feely tree-hugging' moment
and mention the effect of solar and cosmic activity and the
well-recognized 800-year global heating and cooling cycle, which keeps
happening despite our completely insignificant efforts to affect
climate change. And I do wish I had a silver lining to this volcanic
ash cloud, but the fact of the matter is that the bush fire season
across the western USA and Australia this year alone will negate your
efforts to reduce carbon in our world for the next two to three years.
And it happens every year.
Just remember that your government just tried to impose a whopping
carbon tax on you, on the basis of the bogus 'human-caused'
climate-change scenario.   Hey, isn't it interesting how they don't
mention 'Global Warming' anymore, but just 'Climate Change'- you know
It's because the planet has COOLED by 0.7 degrees in the past century
and these global warming bull artists got caught with their pants
down. And, just keep in mind that you might yet have an Emissions
Trading Scheme - that whopping new tax - imposed on you that will
achieve absolutely nothing except make you poorer. It won't stop any
volcanoes from erupting, that's for sure.   But, hey, relax and have a
nice day anyway.

I guess if this is real (and it looks like it), it will be interesting
to see peoples' reactions.
Man To Jump From Stratosphere With No Spacesuit
Press Releases
December 16, 16:05 UTC+3
Unless the World Votes To Save Him, He Faces Certain Death
LONDON, Dec. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/. Death Challenge, Inc., a new
business venture that practices commercially sustainable philanthropy,
announced today the official date of the most spectacular and perilous
event ever to be broadcast live. Death Challenge 1, The Death Dive
( will take place on Good Friday, March
25th, 2016, in the same week as World Water Day.
At 3.33pm Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), "The Challenger", who will remain
anonymous and masked, will risk his life by jumping out of a jet from
the stratosphere, 9.53 miles (15.3 km) above the Earth, and diving
50,300 feet with NO spacesuit, NO pressure suit, NO oxygen and NO
parachute into shark-filled waters – all in a bid to STOP Death by
Dirty Water. (
"This is a cause close to The Challenger's heart,"
( says company spokesperson, Aideen
Doherty. "Having spent extensive time in the areas of the world most
affected by waterborne diseases, he has witnessed firsthand the
dramatic effects of this solvable problem. The Challenger also
suffered from a near-fatal illness after drinking dirty water during
his travels. Nearly 2 million children die annually from dirty water;
therefore, in order to bring an end to this crisis, The Challenger is
willing to risk his own life."
An event without parallel or precedent, the Death Dive will be
streamed live to a global pay-per-view audience, all of whom will be
able to vote whether or not to "Save The Challenger" by offering
lifelines. Both the online audience and those at the dive site itself
can purchase votes before and during The Challenger's historic leap of
faith, saying "YES" or "NO" to three possible lifelines. Crucially, no
lifelines will be accepted by The Challenger unless one billion votes
are purchased globally, symbolic of the approximate number of people
not having access to the most basic ingredient of life – clean water.
In Lifeline One (active at 25,000ft–20,000ft), a circling aircraft
will toss out a parachute which The Challenger will try to chase down
and put on under near-impossible conditions. In Lifeline Two (active
at 20,000ft–15,000ft), a rescue skydiver will pursue the exhausted and
oxygen-deprived Challenger in an attempt to complete the first-ever
mid-air hook up without any safety equipment. In Lifeline Three
(active at 15,000ft–7,000ft), an aircraft will release a tow rope,
which The Challenger will try to grab and use to skysurf into the
water. If The Challenger misjudges the skytow, he could collide with
the aircraft or take out its wing or tail controls. If The Challenger
blacks out upon exiting the jet, there is an additional option to
release a rescue team to provide him with oxygen. However, this
lifeline will only be activated if 7.125 billion votes are first
secured – the equivalent of the entire human race voting to save one
man and all the people of the world without access to clean water.
Other ways to contribute to the global success of Death Challenge
( include pay-per-view tickets to watch
online, VIP tickets to watch the event from an aircraft or boat at the
dive site – or underwater with sharks at the point of impact – and a
special option to purchase a ride to the Stratosphere with The
"The risks of the jump are more than monumental," says company
spokesperson, Aideen Doherty. "As he jumps, The Challenger will face
insanely low air pressure, freezing temperatures and oxygen
starvation, all which can lead to imminent death."
The Challenger is one of the world's most experienced extreme
athletes, having completed just under 20,000 skydives, more than 5,000
high dives and thousands of hours of cage-free dives with Great White
sharks over the past 30 years. He will use multiple extreme
disciplines in an attempt to survive a dive more than 260 times higher
than the current world record – approaching twice the height of Mount
The Challenger is the first to risk his life in The Death Challenge.
Death Challenge 1, The Death Dive, is a Category 10 event, deemed by
experts to offer zero chance of survival. Death Challenge 1 will also
feature and be supported by musical entertainment from new and
well-known artists. Death Challenge will continue to showcase extreme
athletes in high-risk events to raise the awareness of and bolster
Death Challenge's philanthropic efforts to end many of the world's
worst social, economic, and humanitarian problems.

will be audited and verified by an international accounting firm. For

I agree with your other volcanic email, and sent you an offlist
acknowledgement and intention to be more mindful (FWIW, I apologize
for my lack of mindfulness that that post evidences). But not this
one. To me this skydiving 'event' speaks to who we are as humans on
this planet. And who do we want to be. I think it's potentially a very
bad and rather shocking precedent - one man holding the rest of
humanity to ransom, cynical monetizing of human death in a way which
'the average consumer' might actually take notice of, confronting fat
couch sitting Westerners on their indifference (or lack of awareness)
to at least one of the 'problems' in the world...
Once again, if there has to be a "cypher" element to every post, or
specifically "political anarchy", so be it - it is, and has always
been, my intention to respect the foundation intentions for this list.
I've said that before. Let's be clear on what that is and as I said

Linux Foundation announces project to "advance blockchain technology"
[Announcements] Posted Dec 17, 2015 17:35 UTC (Thu) by jake
The Linux Foundation has announced[1] a new collaborative project[2] to
"develop an enterprise grade, open source distributed ledger framework"
to allow developers to build "robust, industry-specific applications,
platforms and hardware systems to support business transactions". Twenty
companies have joined the effort: Accenture, ANZ Bank, Cisco, CLS,
Credits, Deutsche Börse, Digital Asset Holdings, DTCC, Fujitsu Limited,
IC3, IBM, Intel, J.P. Morgan, London Stock Exchange Group, Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), R3, State Street, SWIFT, VMware, and Wells
Fargo. "Many of the founding members are already investing considerable
research and development efforts exploring blockchain applications for
industry. IBM intends to contribute tens of thousands of lines of its
existing codebase and its corresponding intellectual property to this
open source community. Digital Asset is contributing the Hyperledger
mark, which will be used as the project name, as well as enterprise
grade code and developer resources. R3 is contributing a new financial
transaction architectural framework designed to specifically meet the
requirements of its global bank members and other financial
institutions. These technical contributions, among others from a variety
of companies, will be reviewed in detail in the weeks ahead by the
formation and Technical Steering Committees."

References: And you've especially highlighted one of John's points - you name your
mirror "cryptome" and you're a) showing severe disrespect, b)
deceiving others who don't know, c) violating the goodwill associated
with Cryptome and John.
I just wish such things were so obvious they did not need to be spelled out.
WTF?! Do you hear what you're saying?
John, thank you for your previous email reminding us there are higher
standards we just might wish to hold ourselves to, and your genuine
acceptance of others as they are - it's so easy to be otherwise
blinded. I'm sure my true colours show as much as Michael and others
too, and it's embarrassing how often I get picked up off the floor and
dusted off.
Perhaps wikileaks ought have just posted a hash sum file to "ensure verity".
John, you evidently have great strength of resolve and fortitude of
spirit, since what it must have taken to start and keep Cryptome going
"pre-wikileaks" - wikileaks created some submission secrecy,
clandestine facility, making it feel easier to leak, less stressful at
leak time (notwithstanding little improvement in real protection of
big leakers like Manning, so could be called deceiving in that sense).
Your courage in doing what you saw must be done, in public, in spite
of lack of 'privacy', in spite of exposure. So many today use a nom/
nim and think they're being secretive or elite, 'publicly discussing
freedom and liberty from the State', but hiding from who? The 5 eyes,
9 eyes, 100 eyes get their target in general. Benefits?
Common sense aint so common.
You had to read the prior sentence. It's nothing much really, just
patting someone condescendingly on the head as a prelude to gently
inserting a knife. That sort of genre. Unless I'm wildly off base...
John, my regards and respect,

It's a funny thing about rights - the government, police, courts,
schools etc, can not *exercise* my rights for me.
It is only I who can exercise -my- rights. That's the very nature of
exercising one's rights.
Ie. the point where so many rights 'proclaimers' yet
'fail-to-exercise-ers' have resulted in such fear, oppression and
finally tyranny, that it is too late to rescue the 'reasonable system'
from the bad people who co-opted it, without said revolution.
Well the mind is the great trickster so am certain that lying 'for the
courts' will be somehow twisted by someone into 'lying for God' is a
good thing.
Humans will in general continue to do nothing rather than live a right
with any risk to even a little bit of personal liberty, and it looks
like we shall soon see whether humans will in general lie for the
government, in denial of self and fellow human's' rights,
but wait there's more of course, with Neighbourhood Watch, Crime Watch
and now "dob in a neighbour (sorry, 'suspicious activity')" programs,
we are but a small step away from "if you fail to dob in your
neighbour, -you- will be punished'.
And the decent of human shall be complete. Not only the police and
military up-holding the tyranny of my state (government), but every
fucking so-called 'human' out there (or most of them anyway).
But anyway who wants to have freedom for all those evil plant
cultivators, evil self medicator mind journey trippers, evil gun
users, evil home building experimenters, evil home educators, evil
reiligious believers and evil thought thinkers?
Seth you are right, very few will ever lift a finger for their own
human rights, let alone for the rights of others, since they -do- see
it as a gamble of personal liberty. So I say that those:
- who fail to remain silent when 'ordered' to tell a lie,
- who fail to speak when 'ordered' to hide the truth,
- who fail to take action and live a right when human freedom is challenged,
- who fail to take ANY gamble FOR our human rights and dignity by
LIVING our human rights,
- and finally complain about "things getting worse" and, oh heaven
forbid we might get a revolution,
May they be micro-chipped into pervasive monitoring and compliance,
taxed of all their wealth and further indebted into total slavery!!!
For those of us who prize freedom so greatly, death is a better
option. Yet for such slaves as described above, they would cling to
their "right to be in slavery".
I can hear it now "Stop Right There - I get TWO meals of rice and
sugar a day, but all my friends only get one, that's why I'm the slave
manager and with shoes instead of bare feet - I like my golden bird
cage so don't you dare suggest I rock the boat! I'm raising my child
to be a manager too, so we've got a FUTURE to look forward to! Now
fuck off with all your freedom lies you filthy commie gun-totin
plant-growin devil-worshipn fag! You aint even got a mico chip!!!"
"But Jim, I was doin this for you my son - I promised your ma when she died!"
Pick a path responses:
Oh grarpamp, our sweetly naive grarpamp. If only
it were so. You must remember this *is* -humans- we are talking about.
I agree that to speak is not hard, yet to face one's fear of
deprivation of a little personal liberty, even for a night or two in
the clink, is far more than most so-called "humans" are capable of.
History has born this out just occasionally I might add...
grarpamp, I agree, just speak the truth judiciously, stand for your
rights, and face your fear. There's no more to it than that, yet in
the fullness of the experience of the living of ones rights and
freedoms, there can arise within oneself a little confront - which is
quite the personal growth experience for those who are into that sort
of thing. And those who are not, you mofos fail to be worthy of the
name "human"!
Bottoms up!
I do hope that enough humans speak freely, travel freely, grow some of
those plants "man" has dominion over (to use a phrase at the
foundation of some of our legal systems). It would be nice.

There may be problems with the USA foundation documents in terms of a
"more ideal" structure for a democracy.
Unfortunately it's the power-hungry and self interested actors who
dominate the system (and I dare say any system) which is the problem,
not so much the system. This occurs because most sheeple want to be
shorn, as long as they have their golden cage (and their tummies
As has been said round here before, we aint seen a system properly put
into practice without bad actors. With enough bad actors, no system
can protect against, since they just change the system to suit
A robust system can only ever be as good as its people. Not its
rulers/ government, but you and I, those who actually live their
rights - speaking truth when it needs to be told, traveling the
highways and byways and refusing to pay the corporation taxes (road
tolls), keeping silent when ordered to tell a lie, and on it goes.
You are mixing up things here. Putting the USA foundation documents
into practice, does not result in a ponzi scheme.
The bad actors who desired and achieved control of the money power
(and lost it, and regained it - go read up on your history, it's all
over the interwebs) now run a ponzi scheme where inflation is the
exact measure of the (illegal) transfer of wealth from the people (via
the people and its government debts) to the currently privately held
The money power is ultimately a power of the people, but two (or
three? - I'm in Australia, I don't know your exact history) times, the
money power was stolen by private hands, at the point of guns. The
money power is unfortunately currently in private hands, and yes, is
currently run as a ponzi scheme (rather than a credit based credit
expansion system it's now a debt based credit expansion system, which
is mathematically guaranteed to "reset" once in a while causing
enormous transfers of wealth to the (private) bankers in a much
shorter time period than normally occurs - a mathematical certainty in
such a system, and the time of reset is also entirely controlled by
the central bank).
You mean bad hackers (crackers) or good hackers too?
It's more that there will always be those who desire wealth, prestige
and power, and tomorrow it might be you or your children, and of
course you or they would of course do the "right" thing with that
money, prestige and power, unlike all the other wealthy, prestigious
and powerful people. And so there's a kind of innate standoff. Those
who have thoughts of how to achieve such things, are often the ones
who imagine themselves in such positions (of wealth etc).
The word mafia implies "bad" overlord. And overlord (wealthy
prestigious powerful person) may use their position for the
furtherance of the development of mind, creativity and spirituality.
In which case they would be in the class "benevolent dictator" or at
least "benevolent (over)lord".
I believe (but can't back it up right now) that historically, the
benevolent dictatorship is about as good as a system can get. The
challenge is transitioning from one benevolent dictator, to the next
(ie, finding/ training/ testing someone to actually be benevolent in
their high position).
Oligarchies go to war with each too often.
But as I said before, I think any system can be successful, as long as
there are enough humans worthy of the term.
The impeachment because of his lie - not because of the blowjob.
Yes it's depressing, even those who achieve high rank fail to tell the
truth in dignity when it needs to be spoken.
A system can be no better than its people.

But that shifts the ground on what Rob was speaking to.
Sure you can say 'in the default state of "all rights reserved"', that
'copyright exists automatically', and we can even go so far as to say
the --current legal regime-- grants 'copyright protection by default',
which in jurisdictions I am aware of, is the case.
BUT, copyright itself, is a legal fiction. THIS (as I read it) is the
foundation on which Rob makes his point. So, we most of us do in fact
live in an artificial statutory regime of various legal fictions, one
of which is called copyright, the right to make copies, and the right
to grant (or restrict, by default or otherwise) others the right to
make "copies".
In THIS regime (default statutory fiction rights, re copying), the BSD
and GPL licenses "restore rights that copyright otherwise restricts" -
Rob's words are precise, correct, and clear.
This is a non-argument, and I'm not sure you're making a point, or
making your point in a way I can understand.
The "restoration" that Rob speaks to is **the author's** choice of
license, the *author*, who by "statutory legal fiction right by
default" is granted exclusive right to make copies of --author's own
work--, chooses, of --his own free will-- to "restore" to recipients
of author's said works, certain rights otherwise restricted by said
statute fiction rights.
Rob's words are clear and simple. Mine are verbose. Grarpamp, am I
understanding your position correctly, or am I missing something (as
in, from my viewpoint, you were missing Rob's point)?
In the regime of legal fiction rights, yes...
No it does not. GPL ensures that recipients may not -further restrict-
the freedoms 'granted' by the GPL (which is presumably the author's
desire and reason for choosing to license under GPL); BSD only ensures
-first recipient- has "GPL like" freedoms, in addition to the "freedom
to futher distribute under proprietary license", which some of us
consider to be a freedom that ought not be granted, and for those who
consider this way, the GPL is therefore a much better choice - the
point being, if the -first recipient- of BSD licensed software
thereafter distributes under freedom-removing license (proprietary),
said recipients are no longer using free/libre software, but
proprietary software - this is what GPL attempts to handle/ improve
upon, and yes, some people prefer to distribute their software with
the right for recipients to distribute as proprietary ("the freedom to
take away freedom").
:)  Your liberal viewpoint is technically correct, -for the example
you give-; but as you must well know, Alice or Bob may "remove the BSD
license when they distribute" (or to use your term, "slap on a
proprietary license") to Bob and Carl respectively. Ignoring this
alternative pathway in your argument, does not make that pathway
On this point I agree with you. BSD grants all the freedoms that GPL
does, -as well as- the freedom for the recipient to add restrictions
of any sort when he further distributes. So in that technical sense,
the BSD license provides "more freedom".
GPL proponents (which include myself), consider that the GPL's 'hack'
of the legal fiction rights granted by statute law, is a useful
mechanism to work towards maximising the amount of free/libre software
available in the world, over the long term. It is a valid, and
apparently effective, strategy.
And one I wholeheartedly support :)
I welcome reviews of my new play, Pirates of the Commons:

One of the most significant benefits - learning to face one of your
fears. Think you're tough, strong, emotionally balanced? Get up in
front of a Magistrate and facing down the prosecutor, and see what
your knees do then :)
Do that a few times, and start to feel awesome! Self esteem fast track...

True. I'm thinking individuals here.
Corporations are bound to their economic imperative to make such trade
offs. This is the heart of their sociopathic nature. This is the part
of corporations/ companies which needs, somehow, to change in order to
get this world on a better track.
Here's the kind of talk that looks like a hole freshly dug.
Perhaps if there is an actual existential threat to someone's life or
some building (let's please stop using the T word), then "high
pressure persuasion" would be adequate for a court order anyway. As it
should be - up to the point of a subpoena, summons and/ or order to
perform or act - to handle the actual problem.
You seem though to be normalising behaviours and approaches and "high
pressure persuasion" tactics by government departments, in a
generalised way. You might not be intending the things you imply/ say,
but don't be surprised when such positions are mocked or ridiculed.
Don't take such blow back as personal at all though - it's the
"normalisation of bad" and "plainly wrong/ evil" which is being
attacked for the bullshit it is.
Perhaps try something this instead: "And for-profit therefore
sociopathic-by-nature companies do massively collect your metadata AND
your personal information, with or without your consent, and are well
leaked and reported to use and abuse all your data both within and
beyond the law, beyond your expectations, and beyond what many people
consider ethical."
See what we did there? We made it personal, giving a slight hope to
the uninitiated to realise something they did not realise before. We
highlighted some foundations (for profit being inherently
sociopathic). We reminded the reader that their consent is often not
obtained (yes, we can argue about implied consent, the point is we're
edumacating). We make the assertion that companies actually abuse all
that data (whatever "abuse" might mean), just in case someone missed
the memo.
With all this, we are also implying that this abuse is wrong.
Your version sounds like you are -trying- to normalise the wrong,
justify the bad, and 'accept the new messed up world order as best we
can'. We hear enough of that from others. And I saw NO to that abuse!
Give me justification for abuse, at your peril!
"should be" trustworthy?
They're companies. You've missed the bloody memo. And a very bloody
memo the corporate record is, for decades and across industries!
You're not grokking the incentive. It's profit. And it's more than an
incentive, profit is the foundational company-constitutional
imperative for companies (funny that).
This is why companies can NOT be trusted. You seem to be missing this
basic point. Do you own a company?
Some companies start with good policy, and good public stance, most
significantly in this conversation, Google itself - "do no evil". They
don't say that any more. They can't. Did you ever wonder why they
stopped saying that?
Trust is a relevant foundation to community/ society, sure.
But now you've segued into personal. Which is a good place at times,
an effective place. It's more tangible for people.
But here we were talking about companies. I would ordinarily presume
your trust formula is different for companies that it is for actual,
you know, humans.
I suggest not overloading corporate rights, corporate trust, with
human rights, human trust. Not particularly useful in our context.
A rational approach is warranted for sure.
Companies, and in most cases humans working for them, are
predominantly incentivized by money. Yesterday I read an article on
the Great Wall of China. Incredible vision, so many centuries of
building. But when it came down to the time it was 'needed', due to
there being only so many sentries, and so far spread out, and the
sentries paid so little, when the marauding Mongols wanted in, to do
some marauding, they just bribed a sentry or two. Apparently same with
the Europeans in more recent times. So, incentivized people were,
secure, wall was not. The biggest security theater.
I think the great wall may have been useful psychologically though...
to encourage a mindset of unity in the people within.
Your ethics are admirable. I share your personal intentions. I don't
trust companies though, except to plunder markets to the maximum
profit possible.

Nah - firefox is a lithe little vegetarian pea pod, lucky to use 1% of
one CPU and a bee's proverbial of your RAM, LibreOffice is so small
and feature free it's lucky to even print a document, and the Linux
kernel, well, it's so clean, small and well documented it's just a few
lines longer than HelloWorld.c - so of course it's well audited and
highly secure as a result. Couldn't ask for cleaner security really.

Tut, tut! They should have indeed.
Naughty, naughty I tell you! Naughty little boys and girls.
Wonderful! There's hope! U S A, U S A!
So those intelligent CIA guys will stop toppling regimes by murder and
plunder, to keep the US$ afloat and to keep trying for their one world
f-ing government, and those respectable NSA guys will use their phone
tapping of France, Germany, UK, Australia and every other nations
politicians to create a safer, cleaner, more caring world, with
regional sovereignty respected, the will of the people upheld, and a
fundamentally fairer wealth system throughout the world! Hallelujah
brother's and sisters, Amerika vilt save youse all. Now bend over and
think of something pleasant.
Damn, how many of us wish that were true. Being the authority in
principle, is so vastly different to living that authority. We saw all
that gun-ho hoo hah go right out the window when the US Marshalls
roamed the streets and confiscated by force of armed guard requests,
many (most?) of the guns in the area.
Ahh yes, that's more like it, just an essence of authority, a remnant,
not much actual authority in the people. Sadly. So very very sadly. We
can only hope that people will wake up and start living their rights.
By the time people wake up, it's usually too late. Pol Pot's people
never woke up and when asked why he caused the massacre of much of his
nation, he answered "it was an experiment", AIUI to see what people
would do in the face of such evil.
Man that's some good weed you're smokin, don't be so greedy and pass
it around bro!

Damn! From Russia and China yeah? Wow. What a mindset.
"The United States has been involved in and assisted in the overthrow
of foreign governments (more recently termed "regime change") without
the overt use of U.S. military force. Often, such operations are
tasked to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)."
I grant they seem to be doing ... something. Here's the table of

Perhaps those are the countries that were going to overrun "us" (never
mind the fact I live in Australia anyway, but damn, what a way of
SDW, thank you for being so frank - honest about how you think. It is
educational to me in a good way. Part of the difference is perhaps
that I am not living in the USA, so I look inwards to your government
and agencies, not outwards.
Interesting way of "understanding" the world - 'regime change' is
about as polite a way the current empire can couch its predominant
activity since WWII.
Sounds like you're focusing on the small stuff, the little "local"
political show. And a show it is, and apparently quite effective...
Time to wake up. You evidently need to do more research. The balance
of good vs. evil, of the once mighty USA, is well and truly tipped in
favour of despotism and cronyism at this point in history. Very
unfortunately. And notwithstanding the good remnant who do remain
actually within the system (as insignificant and ineffective as they
are to effecting good into the world).
Greece. Rome. Persia. British Empire. USA.
Every empire falls. USA has fallen, it just can't quite see the
reality of this yet.
"No better than all the rest". Fixed that for you.
The record is abysmal. USA is "morally" (on an international political
and death-toll level) and financially bankrupt.
I just pray that the end of USA's grab for global hegemony means a
long lasting multi-polar world, and not a new imperialist Chinese
"empire regime".
You're missing the point. "Regime change" means if you're in their
way, your life ends. Time for you to do some history lessons. Because
you feel safe (you're one of the "good guys" right?), you don't see
the problem, and you therefore have difficulty hearing the message.
Sadly, individual liberty was not respected enough to capture the
sanction of foreign thinkers. I'm being extraordinarily conservative
in my words here...

0) Whilst using modern Intel vaseline chips:
1) Program full FLOSS stack for circuit/chip dev:
# some starts:
apt-cache search circuit
apt-cache search electron
2) Start with one of the FLOSS CPUs, eg SPARC2, and divide and conquer
it's analysis audit.
3) With open audited/auditable fab, we burn some chips.
4) Now divide and conquer to analyse those physical chips, using
physical analysis one step below the process node - eg 120nm chip,
60nm chip analysis.
As these steps occur, software is developed to facilitate each step of
course. Proprietary software for the audit bits though to make sure it
is not backdoored by Intel.

References: Attempting a conceptual pathway to some form of digital/ connected
communication sanity:
Foundations (please jump in):
- No operating system is spared.
- No browser is spared.
- MITM with existing "web" tech is industrialized, pervasive, and
unstoppable even by infosec/ security "professionals".
- There are some library fuzzing "security improvement" projects (e.g.
Google's fuzzing projects for image libraries etc as depended on by
Chrome etc), but the layers and levels of dependencies are far greater
that a few libraries, as seen in the OP article in this thread - SVG
libs, lower level networking, higher level networking, HDDs/ SSDs
dieing, malware being added onto downloaded/ upgraded software left
right and center with no operating system spared, and (from the sound
of the article) digital signatures still "matching" somehow.
Fuck! This is intense!
Some possible next steps to focus on:
- How to ensure that what we download, e.g. for an Ubuntu system
upgrade, is actually what is intended to be distributed by the
- How can we reduce the dependencies when "publicly browsing" - e.g.
slim down TBB (e.g. do not support SVG fonts, and much more)?
- How do we improve the security of the code we are depending on (in
the public website viewing pipeline)? E.g. industrialized fuzz-testing
(libraries, kernel-level code like the network stack, kernel data
structures, kernel drivers etc)?
Medium to longer term:
- Now that no OS is spared when accessing public web sites, even with
F2F encrypted network infrastructure, we need a specification/
foundations for a hardware-level F2F network node - e.g. libre open
code from the BIOS/ firmware up to "userspace" e.g. the VPN code etc.
- What type of F2F network makes sense?
- What type of crypto is reasonable with current think, for our F2F networks?
- Document protocols for key exchange/ OS installation/ F2F HUG meetings etc.
- Userspace network stack - Simplify (and audit) network packet
pathways - e.g. take a copy of the Linux network stack, remove
everything extraneous, perhaps make it a user-space thing with really
minimal "driver" code in the kernel only - this might be a good
foundation for multiple cross-project collaboration (eg TBB, I2P, Tor
node, Gnunet, mixmaster, openvpn, whonix/ qubes, etc).
Next steps:
- if there's a monthly computer user group meetup in reasonable
distance, start participating
- if not, create one
- begin one or more of the above steps - even assisting with the
documentation of a step
- where possible, work with others, build community
- build trust
- build real trust networks (human to human connections, whoah!)
- build digital trust networks
High priority:
- figure out how to create a cryptographically and networkingly secure
F2F network, and document this e.g.:
  - hardware nodes can only begin to be trusted if they host no
end-user WWW-facing software!
  - how to configure apt so that ubuntu package installation checks
multiple hashes/ signatures for each package downloaded/installed - we
absolutely must create a software distribution and verification
protocol which is essentially uncrackable
  - how to establish surety that your ubuntu/rawhide "package signing
key" matches that actually intended to be distributed by the
corresponding project, e.g.:
     - view the signature of the key on the project's HTTPS web page
     + check the key as it appears published on one or more mailing lists
     + compare your version of the signature with the signature that
others have at your local HUG
     + ??
We've been officially fucked over, we have no option but to start
again with a new internet. there's no option but for each of us to
start doing our bit.
Good luck, and please post your success stories so we all can benefit
and be inspired,

References: Sorry, I'm thinking about it differently - like a physical layer.
Let's name it differently: H2H - HUG node to HUG node, which might be
overlayed over existing ISP/ centralized net, or might be your own PHY
layer (e.g. local street-level wireless).
So, treat this is a PHY layer, where everyone is expected to connect,
relatively speaking, to their neighbours.
A F2F (by terminology/meaning) would overlay on top of that.
The key that I2P (and Tor for that matter) are missing is fill packets
- i.e., the nodes you talk to, promise to backfill their link to you
(likewise you to them) any empty packet slots, so that the link
maintains a continuous throughput (to hide all real traffic within) -
the only thing a state-level adversary (or ISP-level for that matter)
can do to analyse things is kill the link entirely (shock testing),
which can correlate your traffic with "exit node" traffic, but is much
harder to see anything when you are only operating within the dark
This is now a very important feature which our anonymizing network
software needs in order to provide any meaningful protection.
Local PHY is now also very very useful to increasing network access
anonymity. This urgently needs some research study/papers to analyse/
determine the best ways (within eg onion routing context) to maximise
advantage of off-net (private PHY layers).
"Just use..." is very problematic! Please do not be so cavalier with
your languaging as those without understanding might mistake your
absolutist languaging for relevant fact (as opposed to intuitive sense
or reasonable avenue for consideration depending on various factors
.... etc etc)!
There are many models.
I am confident that local off-net PHY connections can go a long way to
increasing anonymity provided by anonymizing P2P networks - it's an
avenue unfortunately untapped, and even more so, not yet studied
This is one small, yet important, piece of the longer term puzzle.
Great. Looking forward to your thoughts. Please don't portend that
there are easy conclusive "solutions". There are not!
Sounds like you've indeed done some thinking. Thank you very much for
sharing your thoughts.

You just bought not only the false presumption, but a logical
impossibility - without knowledge in detail of the CIA's actual
actions, I am unable to prove their violations.
Are you suggesting CIA, NSA, FBI, etc ought do what they will, except
ath someone is able to say that what they've been doing is not in U.S.
best interest? That sounds inane.
I am not even in U.S. nor a U.S. citizen - to me your statement sounds
highly problematic and indicative and problematic nationalist think.
Yes we need a balance of powers in the world - we need national
strength and unity, but this applies to all countries, not just to the
Collections of power, as happens with govt, attract more power abusers
than benevolent dictators, unfortunately. For this reason, a one world
government would be doomed from the outset. We need a strong Russia, a
strong America, and strong small countries etc.
It's the only hope for any long term semblance of balance. If the
world we a single U.S.A.W. entity, Snowden could never have happened.
Of course Snowden required a courageous individual too, but it would
have required someone willing to actually give up the rest of their
life if there were no possbility of sanction anywhere in the world.
You might reconsider your push to have someone other than yourself
somehow prove that the CIA's actions over the decades have not been in
U.S. best interests, or that this is a relevant question!

And somehow you presume such things are in the best interests of the USA?
Good luck convincing people on that one...
What I want is for "loose cannon power wielders" to principle the fuck
up. Overthrowing governments does not mesh with my idea of principle,
nor human rights, nor national strength, dignity, rule of law - not a
damn thing I hold important.
There appears to be abundant evidence over the years that the US is
throwing its political, economic and military might around, all over
the world, just being a bully, without respect for ethics, principle,
national sovereignty, dignity, human rights, without even respect for
the rule of law and as a total hypocrite to its own past behaviour -
compare Kosovo actions to Ukraine dialog.
Sure, in principle we can say "every one is doing their best".
Well, their best is not fucking good enough, since almost no one (it
appears) sacrifices personal convenience for their greater ideals and
principles, and somewhere up the chains of command those with "genuine
power" run amok far too often.
By all means dear CIA and CIA apologists (and NSA, FBI, USAGOV,
ANY_OTHER_ENTITY), publicize your good outcomes and your stands for
what we common folk consider principles, human rights, fairness and
the like. Give us hope. Give us stories of the great democtratic
benefits you've brought to the countries whos governments you've
successively installed, overthrown, installed, overthrown.
Love to hear genuine positivity facts.
Facts to the contrary ('negative' outcomes) abound by incontrovertible
evidence or for thinking men and women, incontrovertible conclusion.
Bring on the CIA is Wonderful for The World facts. Please! I really,
really want to believe the world is in better shape than it bloody
well appears to be!
Demonstrate the three letter agencies of USAGOV that have upheld,
rather than violated, human rights around the world (hell, even in
their own country!). From where we peasants sit, those in power
continue to justify their every apparent misdeed somehow - 'the end
justifies the means' perhaps? Meanwhile the world goes to hell in a
hurry. Since the far less than admirable 'means' predominate, over and
over and over again.
Find some other idiot's mouth to put words in. This one's evidently
failed to raise the tone of this particular dialog.
Good luck with your thesis and here's hoping others can do a better
job of bringing something higher to this world.
"Once you set up a covert operation to supply arms and money, it's
very difficult to separate it from the kind of people who are involved
in other forms of trade, and especially drugs. There is a limited
number of planes, pilots and landing strips. By developing a system
for supply of the Contras, the US built a road for drug supply into
the US."

When no straightforward reason for a government's foreign political
actions is evident, nor becomes evident over time, and this lack of
sanity evidences itself decade in, decade out, then what legitimacy
can said government truly have besides "might is right"?
"Tim," your rhetoric speaks loudly.
Perhaps a bit more reading for you? Or do you really intend to back
that the USA is the principled, honourable, fair and reasonable
example we (the rest of the world) should all be drinking from?
Nope. None here. Feel free to try some form other then sarcasm -
perhaps empathy, or rationality..
What I see is a world where the power players (lead by example
principally by the US since WWII) cause/foment much human strife
around the world.
Governments/ "other countries" are "pretty good at digging their own
graves" you say? My, what big rationale you have...
I missed the part where the US still holds the moral high ground?
Seriously ... I missed that part. I get that it might be difficult
looking out from within...
I so -want- those who hold power to live to a higher "moral" standard
- hell, any standard that we "mere peasants" (like, what the fuck
would we know?) can perceive consistently as being worthy of some, or
any, admiration.
I find the world a rather sad place, in far too many ways. It saddens
me greatly that the United States of America has sacrificed her
international good will to such an extent as is the case.
Expect hope and empathy from me, but no sympathy.  Individual humans
must wake up, and begin to take individual and human stands. Stands of
compassion, justice, principle.
Please. To the best of your ability, take the words of your founding
fathers to heart. Live as best you can in the heritage that was
intended for you. And encourage as many others to do likewise.
I suspect significant turmoil in the years to come, and I do not envy
any one who must suffer such consequences.  It's just a hunch I have.
When power fails and the lights go out, people get scared of the dark,
of the uncertainty.
Everything has cycles, nations no less.

References: For a potentially useful project to many: software to crawl and cache
popular news sites into a content addressed darknet/ localnet cache,
so that folks can browse the daily news without using exit nodes.
Trust network above that is a separate task entirely.
For bonus points, have the content addressing be in git.
Just as the disadvantages of HFT (high frequency trading) can be
handled with a trade-window model (all trades are batched into a 1s,
or 10s or whatever window to be resolved by the exchange at the end of
each window), "inhibit packet until ready" makes me think this might
be applied to Tor networks - specifying a "relatively high" minimum
latency for new session initiation. But again, it's the type of
problem/solution potential which needs genuine analysis to know if
there's going to be a non-trivial privacy enhancing benefit. I can
only make assumptions sorry.
E.g. your entry point (e.g. ISP) introduces "random peak bandwidth
drops/ latency holes" and when the ISP's incoming networks fail to
keep up their side of this same bargain, the link deteriorates
This implies an ISP who is on the side of the users, at this point a
rare thing (if it exists at all).
This 'feels' like it has potential. Except I think it presumes that at
least your starting node(s) (eg ISP) are not actively adversarial to
you - but are we assuming this anyway with current Tor? (Sorry for my
A thought I've pondered for a couple years now - and now in this
context, let's say my geographic neighbour and I each have an ISP
uplink, and wireless connection between one another.
If my "underlying fill traffic network" (physical/PHY layer, at least
from my perspective as an end user) can somehow include the private
connection between my neighbour and I, and if the ISP actively targets
one of us and crimps the connection, and then the neighbour similarly
("pro-actively") crimps his connection in 'almost parallel', could
this provide some level of plausible deniability of the exit-node
traffic being correlated to either one of us?
(Expand algorithmically to more than one neighbour.)
Is it worth beginning an "ISP end user fill traffic protocols best
practices RFC" for those ISPs who genuinely want to do the right
thing, legally as well as by their customers?
Or is the multiplexing of the last-node-before-the-home (eg the ISP's
DSLAM ADSL modem bank) simply not capable of such things?
I guess what I'm asking: what's the ideal way to roll out
community-/state- wide internet networking infrastructure, from a
respect-the-uesrs-privacy perspective?
Let's keep asking the questions and attempting to answer them, and see
if we can't eliminate the benefit logically (without having to wait
for a high fallutin' acamedic paper).
Eg 1: there are fibre-optic "DSLAMs" (modem banks? - dunno the term
sorry), which simply broadcast all client downlinks to all end-points,
and it's only the end point modems which "do the right thing" and
ignore their neighbour's traffic.
In this scenario, there may only be 2Gbps of bandwidth shared amongst
1000 homes. If all homes jump on the "maximize fill traffic"
bandwagon, each will get at most a fixed 2Mbps link - fast by many
standards, but nowhere near what would be achieved in a
forget-about-privacy scenario.
And then, what should happen at the ISP level?
What sort of protocols would make sense for ISP interconnection - to
other ISPs, to upstream ISP/ national backhaul, to international
(usually expensive) links?
Eg 2: ADSL DSLAM - can this device scale reasonably to all homes
connected to this DSLAM?
In either scenario, do we need to start thinking new equipment, or
just new protocols - since fill-traffic is a type of protocol and as
we've read, proposals have been made for ethernet-level fill traffic.
Clear thinking, ask the hard questions, gather answers, write it up in
an RFC or draft "paper", post for review, and it'll eventually get
archived at the usual places - even if the answers are "we can't do X
and Y for reasons A and B" - these would be very useful answers.

other countries and the inviolability of borders in Europe
 -   However, this did not extend to the sovereignty and the
territorial integrity of Federal Yugoslavia which could be trampled at
 -   Nonetheless, albeit the territorial integrity of Federal
Yugoslavia itself wasn’t worth anything, the territorial integrity of
its constituent republics seeking independence was holy
 -   Albeit the territorial integrity of the Yugoslav constituent
republics of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina was holy,
the territorial integrity of Serbia was not
 -   Albeit Slovenes, Croats and Bosnian Muslims could leave
Yugoslavia, Serbs could not leave Croatia and Bosnia
 -   Albeit Serbs could not leave Croatia and Bosnia, Kosovo Albanians
could secede from Serbia
 -   Albeit Kosovo Albanians could secede from Serbia, Kosovo Serbs
could not secede from Albanian-run Kosovo
 -   Albeit Kosovo could unilaterally secede from Serbia under NATO
military control, Crimea could not unilaterally secede from Ukraine
under Russian military control

References: <20150622224711.GC23358
---------- Forwarded message ----------
            DOJ vs. Google: How Google Fights on Behalf of Its Users
                   One of the oft-repeated Big Lies -- still bandied about by Google
haters today -- is the false claim that Google enthusiastically turns
over user data to government agencies. This fallacy perhaps reached
its zenith a few years ago, when misleading PowerPoint slides from
Edward Snowden's stolen NSA documents cache were touted by various
commercial parties (with whom he had entrusted the data), in a
misleading, out-of-context manner, designed for maximum clickbait
potential. The slides were publicized by these parties with glaring
headlines suggesting that Google permitted NSA to freely rummage
around through Google data centers, grabbing goodies like a kid set
loose in a candy store.
Google immediately and forcefully denied these claims, and for anyone
familiar with the internal structure and dialogues inside Google,
these allegations were ludicrous on their face. (Full disclosure:
While I have consulted to Google in the relatively recent past, I am
not currently doing so.)
Even an attempt to enable such access for NSA or any other outside
party would have by necessity involved so many engineers and other
Google employees as to make impossible any ability to keep such an
effort secret.  And once known, there would have been very public,
mass resignations of Googlers -- for such an intrusion would strike
directly at the heart of Google philosophy, and the mere suggestion of
such a travesty would be utter anathema to Google engineers, policy
directors, lawyers, and pretty much everyone else at the firm.
Obviously, Google must obey valid laws, but that doesn't mean they're
a pushover -- exactly the opposite.
While some companies have long had a "nod and wink" relationship with
law enforcement and other parts of government -- willingly turning
over user data at mere requests without even attempting to require
warrants or subpoenas, it's widely known that Google has long pushed
back -- sometimes though multiple layers of courts and legal
processes -- against data requests from government that are not accompanied
by valid court orders or that Google views as being overly broad,
intrusive, or otherwise inappropriate.
Over the last few days the public has gained an unusually detailed
insight into how hard Google will fight to protect its users against
government overreaching, even when this involves only a single user's
The case reaches back to the beginning of 2011, when the U.S.
Department of Justice tried to force Google to turn over more than a
year's worth of metadata for a user affiliated with WikiLeaks. While
these demands did not include the content of emails, they did include
records of this party's email correspondents, and IP addresses he had
used to login to his Gmail account.
Notably, DOJ didn't even seek a search warrant. They wanted Google to
turn over the data based on the lesser "reasonable grounds" standard
rather than the "probable cause" standard of a search warrant itself.
And most ominously, DOJ wanted a gag order to prevent Google from
informing this party that any of this was going on, which would make
it impossible for him to muster any kind of legal defense.
I'm no fan of WikiLeaks. While they've done some public good, they
also behave as mass data dumpers, making public various gigantic
troves of usually stolen data, without even taking basic steps to
protect innocent persons who through no fault of their own are put at
risk via these raw data dumps. WikiLeaks' irresponsible behavior in
this regard cannot be justified.
But that lack of responsibility doesn't affect the analysis of the
Gmail case under discussion here. That user deserved the same
protection from DOJ overreaching as would any other user.
The battle between Google and DOJ waged for several months, generating
a relatively enormous pile of associated filings from both sides.
Ultimately, Google lost the case and their appeal.
This was still back in 2011. The gag order continued and outside
knowledge of the case was buried by government orders until April of
2015 -- this year! -- when DOJ agreed to unseal some of the court
records -- though haphazardly (and in some cases rather hilariously)
redacted. These were finally turned over to the targeted Gmail user in
mid-May -- triggering his public amazement at the depth and likely
expense of Google fighting so voraciously on his behalf.
Why did DOJ play such hardball in this case, particularly involving
the gag order? There's evidence in the (now public) documents that the
government wanted to avoid negative publicity of the sort they assert
occurred with an earlier case involving Twitter, and DOJ was willing
to pull out all the stops to prevent Google from even notifying the
user of the government's actions.
You don't need to take my word on any of this. If you have some time
on your hands, the over 300 pages of related filings are now available
for your direct inspection:
So the next time someone tries to make the false claim that Google
doesn't fight for its users, you can print out that pile of pages and
plop it down right in front of them. Or save the trees and just send
them the URL.
Either way, the truth is in the reading.
Be seeing you.

@_subject: Pre-emptive content index 
For quite some years, I never watched any youtubes - then there was a
Java-based website which could download them, but it was cumbersome.
Then there was youtube-dl, and now youtube is starting to head towards
reasonable by my standards, or rather, a reasonable protocol for
"consuming" content - pre-emptive local storage of everything.
This is a principle upon which I view/read anything - nothing
in-browser, no in-browser media players, certainly no flash plugins,
no in-browser PDF viewing etc. I apply the same to code - if I can't
download the source and compile it myself (which sometimes/ often
enough I don't do, but at least I can), then I won't touch it.
So if I've read something I personally considered worthy of the price
of my human attention, it exists somewhere on my local storage.
I call this pre-emptive since I always consistently download the
content before ever reading, listening or viewing (/"consuming" -
sounds like a base description, belittling we humans).
In a "perfect" world, all articles, all content is indexed with git,
or in a git-compatible way, providing enhanced possibilities for
caching, verifying, indexing, retrieval, duplication/ backup, and
sharing and synchronizing with fellow private net sharers. As this
concept and its implementation become pervasive, some publishers would
take advantage of it as a form of compression to reduce publishing
bandwidth requirements (somewhat analogous to torrents, but with
greater integrity of the data being distributed).
"As Tim O'Reilly says, my problem is not piracy, it's obscurity"
Our true coin is our human attention - the ticket to  relevance ->
visibility -> popularity -> ubiquity ,  is the 'free will' choices
that fellow humans make in 'spending' their human attention, their
'life energy', upon that which you create/ publish/ wish to see
manifest into the world. Choose wisely fellow humans, both in your
attempts to shift the attention-spending of others and in your own
I imagine the following:
- A browser plugin, let's call it "Pre-emptive Content Plugin" for
now, which is configured with a data store/directory location for the
browser cache. It's a --bare git repo.
- Each item of content is added, and caching rules are applied on top of that.
- The plugin causes the browser ui/chrome to display (or provide a
shortcut for) "this is important to me" buttons/links/keyboard
shortcuts, which function tells the browser git cache that this
content is to be kept 'permanently' for offline viewing/
synchronization/ backup/ etc.
- A similar ui/chrome element "Hot" informs the plugin that this data/
frame/ page/ website is especially contentious, needing duplication
into the "Pre-emptive Private Net Data Cache for Hot Content", to be
thereafter Striesanded to the world.
Basically, industrializing/ commoditizing content care, custodianship
and distribution.

But, but ... but all those hooks into my kernel are for -security-,
they make my kernel -secure- don't they?
And I guess they invented them because the kernel might have one or
two security bugs or something right?
Or because sysadmins (like my 94yo nan) occasionally make mistakes and
the security modules protect me from them yeah?
And because my lsm override alias is one letter shorter than sudo,
it'll be easier to not make mistakes when I'm making complicated and

I agree that the idea is relatively straightforward in principle, for
someone with enough soldering ability. For any group-buy, a
trustworthy manufacturer/ lead persons, and some method of
hand-to-hand distribution would be required for the paranoid (and
todays paranoiacs have turned out to be tomorrow's wise-in-hindsight
non-crackpots over the last few decades).
But, as has been said many times before here, perhaps even by you Mr
Juan :), is that some of us seriously doubt whether any 'disruptive'
technology can ever solve a social structure, power imbalance, or
power structure abuse problem.
a) Can a small group unite behind a cause in a fundamentally egalitarian way,
and b) is there such a cause that exists, for the small group to unite
behind, which is a significant enough cause to engage the attention
and will of the greater body of our society?
The real problem IMEHO (in my extremely high opinion) is The People
(TM) (GMBH) (C) (R) (PTY) (LTD) failing to grasp their own situation,
failing to hold to principles beyond satisfying the human passions,
and fundamentally failing to give a shit beyond themselves or possibly
their family.
Frankly, humans are a lost cause and will always sell their souls for
not only temporary convenience, but for the avoidance of perceived
short or medium term pain. Readers of this email excepted of course :D
Your guess is the same as mine.

Do you mean "we as in individuals, can't appeal to a USA court to
protect the liberty of an individual who is not a USA citizen and not
physically in the USA"?
Let's get clear on the assumptions and challenge them lest
assumptions, apathy and a desire for others do your work for you
("someone's -really- gotta fix 'my chosen problem'") get's a hold of
your go button and won't let go :)
An individual can make a claim to a court, if they have standing in that court.
Simplistically this means a USA citizen can make a claim (begin a
case) in a USA court (things like age limits etc come into play of
But there's no point making a claim (e.g. for injunction or for
damages) unless the authority (eg a court) that you appeal to has
authority over your target.
Authority in this case also means that your chosen court has authority
in the jurisdiction of your claim; that is, you must make your claim
in respect of the appropriate law(s) for the court you have chosen -
e.g. a lowly Magistrates' Court generally can not (or at least, will
not) make rulings in respect of the constitution, nor of common law.
I don't know about any individual trying to take care of the "liberty
of the people of other countries" but an individual USA citizen may be
able to make a claim against a USA citizen or some part or member of
the USA government in respect of (your "alleged") illegal "foreign"
An individual backed by 100 other individuals in a class action may
experience greater success.
Every problem has a solution, but just may require thinking outside the box.
IANAL, IANA USA citizen, IANA USA resident.

I appreciate your sentiment and what I perceive as your implicit
"folks, consider being cautious" but when you say "fix that" the
obvious question is "how"?
I don't know that -any- system can fix any other system except to
appear to do so for a limited period of time until it too degenerates
due to the usual problems - individual human weaknesses (greed, lust,
anger, unwarranted reactions etc).
Do you actually believe there's an answer to -how- to "fix it"?
Or, are you uncomfortable with this discussion?
If you believe that this discussion is counter productive to what you
perceive as your and or our interests I'm interested to hear about;
but although "fix it" it sounds superficially laudable it's cheap and,
well, superficial.  You'll need to pontificate a little more deeply to
impress folks around these parts :)

I think "those that try to collect via force..." refers to some of the
7e9 humans, not the AIs - why would the AIs need money anyway? They
have perhaps energy need for their existence and ... that's it; except
for some programmed "imperative" - other than survival energy need -
any other imperative is overlaid or in addition to mere survival.
If there are multiple AIs, not one, are they competing - some
dominance imperative? We humans certainly tend to think in terms of
competition - but I say that besides survival, this is a taught reflex
and neither necessary nor our ideal - from the earliest stages of
mental development we get measured by our exam marks and gold stars,
celebrated and praised for our performance "over" others, rewarded
with money for our competitive advantage in "the market" - sadly most
of us "modern trained" humans are thoroughly entrained or schooled
with the competition mindset.
Schooling, sadly so far from education in so many ways.
Such an irony then that we "have" such abundance, or could have - and
yet are so often limited in our language?
When in abundance for all, money needs us if money is to persist as a
dominant or even relevant social concept and reality within our
Money is currently a primary measure of our "competitive performance"
in the current "modern" world, yet where survival is no master
(everyone in abundance) money is now a mere contrivance - a play thing
for some, or perhaps for many. Perhaps money would be useful to
signify standing in a community - esteem or assumed wisdom in decision
Alas further growth of humans is certainly indicated by the current
environment, human rights and inter personal record of the human
keep running hampster!
<7e9>I think I can, I think I can!
Presently those who take positions of power generally appear to be
those who lust after such and evidently these humans carry predominant
intent of competitive "me first" personal agendas (albeit perhaps
extending to family and friends on occasion), sucking through their
snouts from the trough of limitation, presuming scarcity and some
ungodly "need" to act selfishly and to dominate by any means (oh, idk,
may be a middle eastern invasion or something will "prop up" "our
blessed economy").
Can abundance be sustained or indeed is it worth sustaining at all in
the face of the present reality of so many of the 7e9? Many/most
humans, by my eyes so unable to restrain themselves from appealing to
the next vote rather than ever truly stand for a principle, appear to
need royal kicks up the arse. And "the masses" are little better,
riding populist waves of media hype and hysteria.
Conundrums, possibilities, challenges, intentions.
If a worthy one were to appear, could I convince him or her that
humans are worth making a stand for? Well, as I keep getting reminded,
some humans a cool, some thoughtful, others passionate and some fun to
be around on occasion, and some even stand for a principle. It is
those latter ones for which I gather up my bootlaces to walk another
mile and ask for a little forgiveness for my excessive cynicism.
Perhaps we see in the libre software world the beginnings of a
possible model or comprehension for how we might conduct ourselves
(act) and organise ourselves (relate to one another) in a world
structured around the reality of abundance rather than the gross
illusion of competitive scarcity.
Here's hoping, fellow humans!

According to
I did get it wrong - but the model I thought I was getting was the
very first CoCo - at only 4K, and the one I ended up getting by the
time I'd saved enough was the second model, at 16K! That was quite an
improvement for someone about to learn BASIC.
So, I too had a grande olde 16K -whoohooo!
Eventually I even managed to hook up an old cassette recorder of my
mum's, since I was too impatient to wait for enough savings to buy a
swanky new one from the store. By the time floppy drives began gaining
real traction in our area the Apple ][ was the go - it was of course
better to have a computer that others in the area had since we could
of course share software. So I bought a second hand Apple ][

@_subject: Anarchist roads and free travel 
Beginner anarchist alert. Wanting to get a better understanding of
possible outcomes.
How would we handle road-building rent-seekers (i.e. those who would
collect tax/ rent for travel) - i.e. at the moment in Australia banks
give loans to private companies to build roads, which by illegal
(unconstitutional) contracts, massive rents/ taxes over many decades,
are collected from the population?
How would the idea of "all have a right to travel anonymously and
absolutely freely (free from tax, free from arbitrary punishment)" be
manifested in a political anarchy country?
How do we manifest a community wide idea of free travel (implying a
majority interest in infrastructure built and provided at cost) with
the freedom of "rent seekers" and "land owners/ infrastructure
builders" to "freely engage in construction and contract with
travelers upon the roads"?
Is this a prisoner's dilemma?
Although all our roads in Australia were free from "all evil tolls"
for much of a century, the rent seekers corrupted our politicians with
much greese, and now road tolls pop up all over the country. How would
political anarchism not "degrade" to the power of financial corruption
in a similar way as our demoncratic governments?
In Australia, our "democratic powers/ goverment" have facilitated
illegal contracts and multi decade rent seekers to tax the population
on roads already paid for by the government.
Notwithstanding that the jetsons era may make the question of roads
per se less relevant over time, this question in my mind arises
regarding political anarchism and what is termed 'natural monopolies',
in this specific thread, roads.
The Great Charter, or Magna Carta/ Charter, proscribes that there
shall "be no evil tolls" - which means no travel checkpoints requiring
fee payment, i.e. tax collection at point of passing, commonly today
called "road tolls" (at least in Australia). This was to protect
merchants against the taxing intention, and it is a given that this
also includes those not engaging in commerce but still traveling.
Here in Australia not only do we have the present day continuation of
the Magna Carta and the English Bill of Rights (and many other
Imperial Statutes) active within the jurisdictions of our states
(although most people are not aware of this, the courts and
legislation are aware of it) we also have Section 92 of our federal
constitution which states "trade commerce and intercourse [travel]
amongst the states, shall be absolutely free", which interpretation is
open to some debate in political circles despite how it reads to the
common man.
In Australia the Imperial Statutes are firmly entrenched thanks to:
- The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (our federal
constitution) which invokes the Crown;
- The Imperial Acts Application Act (respectively, in each state, such
as New South Wales, Victoria, etc);
- The Australia High Court (our highest court) rulings of Mabo and in
particular Mabo 2 (I think 1999).
Despite what ought be protection, our demoncratic parliaments have
sold our roads to the highest bidder, which in our case is nearly
always Macquarie Bank.

A recent example. Such projects are evidently affordable with
volunteer(s) doing the work. Same goes for any off-grid network.
Perhaps this story will inspire someone to kick off their own little
corner of the locally-controlled internet.
Honestly it doesn't seem the expenses were that great, it seems the
primary investment is one man who did a whole lot of legwork to rent a
microwave link, find relay points, install equipment, do network
supervision and maintenance and so on for free. The numbers are pretty
much all there, initial investment was $25k that they need to pay back
in 36 months. Break-even was 25 users, subtract 25 @ $150 = $3750 in
sign-up fee = $21250 / 36 = ~$600 month in down payment. Running
income = 25 @ $75/mo = $1875 - $900 in microwave rental - $600 in down
payments = $375/mo for running the wireless grid and misc. other
expenses = ~$0 in wages. And now they're paying it down faster so they
can lower prices, with 50 users / $900/mo + a slightly bigger grid it
might drop to $40/mo after the investment cost is paid off in less
than two years. That's not expensive, it's super cheap for rural
For comparison, we're paying ~$500 extra per household on top of of
the ordinary ~$300 sign-up fee and ~$100 monthly fee for the privilege
of getting a fiber rollout with Internet/TV at our cabin here in
Norway. On the bright side, after the first twelve months we don't
have to use it more than 4 months a year, but it's still ~$2000 for
year one and ~$400/year just for the summer. And they're not planning
to lower prices, they're planning to recoup the rest of the roll-out
costs, pay wages and turn a nice profit over the next 20-30 years. But
it's not like in the city where you can connect 100 people in an
apartment building at the time, distances are huge and customers few
so cost per subscriber will be far, far more expensive so I doubt that
we're a cash cow. Anyway to get back on topic, what this community has
that others lack is one very skilled volunteer working for free, on a
commercial basis it would be way different.

debt ceiling, and therefore no more "extraordinary measures". Yes, the
upper limit for tax collection vs interest payments is still 2023, yes
it will still collapse way before then, and this is the good news -
the next reset is a mathematical certainty.
My hope is that the average Joe lifts his game when (and if I guess)

OK, this one's actual negative interest rates, but on deposits (vs for
loans), where you pay the bank to keep your money on deposit; this
breaks the previous assumption/ model that the minimum interest rate
can be zero %, at least for deposits, and so why not for loans as
well, i.e. pay you interest to take out a loan - perhaps trial actual
zero % loans first? :
[the article contains a graph 'growth in notes in circulation across
nations, USD, AUD, EUR, GBP, swedish KRO]
How Sweden's negative interest rates experiment has turned economics on its head
Nordic experimentation with sub-zero interest rates has changed the
way central bankers think about fighting recessions
It has long been believed that when it comes to interest rates, zero
is as low as you can go. Who would choose to keep their money in the
bank if they had to pay for the privilege?
But for the people who control the world’s money, this idea has
recently been thrown out of the window. Many central banks have pushed
their rates into negative territory and yet the financial system has
still to come to an abrupt end.
It is a discovery that flips on its head the conventional idea of how
authorities could respond to future economic crises; and for central
bankers, this has come as a relief.
Central bank policymakers had believed they had run out of room to
support their respective economies
, with their interest rates held close to the floor.
 Traditionally, it was thought that if you wanted to boost the
economy, the central bank would reduce its interest rates. Normally,
the rates offered on savings accounts would follow, and people would
choose to spend more, and save less.
But there’s a limit, what economists called the “zero lower bound”.
Cut rates too deeply, and savers would end up facing negative returns.
In that case, this could encourage people to take their savings out of
the bank and hoard them in cash. This could slow, rather than boost,
the economy.
What is happening now should not – according to conventional thinking
– be possible.
As central bank rates have turned negative, the rates offered on bank
deposits have followed. Yet rather than stuffing cash under
mattresses, people have left their money in the bank or spent it.
Nowhere is the experiment with negative rates more obvious than among
Nordic central banks. Sweden – the first to dabble with negative rates
– is perhaps the prime candidate for such experimentation.
The country already has high savings rates, the third highest in the
developed world according to the OECD
and, despite growing at healthy rates, there appears to be plenty of
slack left in the economy to prevent an overheat.
Unemployment is unusually high for an advanced economy at more than
7pc, still well above its pre-crisis levels of sub-6pc. Crucially, the
Riksbank’s mandate suggests that such a radical experiment is
necessary. Policymakers have battled with deflation since late 2012,
and with inflation at minus 0.2pc in August, it remains well below the
central bank’s 2pc target.
To a great extent, the Riksbank’s hand has been forced by the plight
of the eurozone. A tepid recovery in the currency union has required
the European Central Bank (ECB) to bring in ever-looser policy
As the ECB’s actions have weakened the euro against Sweden’s krona,
the cost of importing goods into Sweden has fallen, and weighed down
on inflation. The Riksbank has had to cut its own rates in response in
an attempt to avoid deep deflation.
 Sweden’s flexible approach to monetary policy has won it the plaudits
of leading credit ratings agency. Standard and Poor’s recently
reaffirmed the country’s triple AAA sovereign rating, remarking on the
benefits it derives from “ample monetary policy flexibility”.
Noting that the Riksbank had introduced both negative interest rates
and quantitative easing, S&P said that “should inflation rates stay
low or the krona appreciate materially, the central bank could lower
the repo rate further”.
Many City analysts believe that the Riksbank will continue cutting,
reducing its key interest rate to minus 0.5pc by the end of the year.
Switzerland’s is already deeper still, at minus 0.75pc, while Denmark
and the eurozone have joined them as members of the negative zone.
What was once thought impossible now seems something that could come
to the UK in the years to come. And even in the US, which is thought
to be just months away from an interest rate rise, the idea of
negative interest rates has gained attention.
At the most recent meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
, which decides US interest rates, one unnamed member said that they
expected negative policy rates at the end of this year and next.
But can policymakers keep at this forever? Even if turns out that the
lower bound was not negative, economists still believe that one
Attempts to estimate the unknown vary, but the fees charged by credit
companies give some indication as to how strongly we prefer to use
cash. These can be as low as minus 3pc according to Barclays,
indicating that central bankers have much more room to slash rates.
Pension funds might be among the first to abandon banks if things get
too painful, because of what in effect can look like a tax on holding
One solution is to give savers nowhere else to go. This idea was
floated by the Bank of England’s chief economist in recent weeks, who
made the case that sub-zero rates will be needed in the near future
 Andy Haldane, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the
UK’s equivalent of the FOMC suggested that to achieve properly
negative rates, the abolition of cash itself might be necessary.
This is one reason why negative rates have been used in Nordic
economies, where societies are already close to cashless. Even sellers
of Sweden’s version of the Big Issue magazine - Situation Stockholm -
are able to accept payment via debit or credit card.
For the immediate future, the British obsession with cash appears to
be intensifying. The Bank of England has said that demand for
banknotes and coins outstrips total spending in the economy
Some of like to hoard it for peace of mind, while many of us hold it
for day to day transactions. And much of it is held abroad, often in
bureaux de change.
There are other - perhaps more sinister - motives to prefer
non-electronic money. Unlike the money stored on spreadsheets, cash is
almost completely untraceable. For those who value their privacy, or
who deal in prohibited goods and services, there’s no beating it.
 Last week, Charles Goodhart, a former MPC member, said that Swiss and
ECB central bankers had been “absolutely shameless” in continuing to
issue high denomination notes, printing 1,000 Swiss franc and 500 euro
These high face values notes “are there to finance the drug deals”, Mr
Goodhart said at the annual Money, Macro and Finance Conference in
London. Sir Charles Bean, also a former deputy governor at the Bank of
England, echoed Mr Goodhart’s concerns.
He said that was “all in favour of getting rid of big-denomination
notes, which are used in the black economy”. Such a move could
increase the cost of holding cash, pushing the lower bound on policy
rates even lower. Sushil Wadhwani, a former MPC member, said: “We
should make it much more expensive to hold cash.”
No politician is likely to prohibit cash entirely, at least not until
it has already all but disappeared from day to day life. Concerns
about surveillance and the power of the state are likely to grow, as
electronic money is completely traceable.
“Cash is useful for small transactions, and until it disappears
naturally, I would be loathe to say let’s outlaw it,” says Sir

The following quote does have embedded links: "there’s argument about
whether the gun related homicides and other various crimes have
actually increased or not. Some places have the homicide rate
increasing at 3.2% along with armed robbery at 44%, while some other
stats have them remaining about the same. At the very least, we do
know that the policies have not significantly decreased crime. That’s
not even being debated. Which…considering that the Australian
government spent a considerable amount of money on the laws, seems at
the very least, disappointing."
That article's comments also linked to the following, which is much more useful:
"Australia enacted one of the largest gun reforms ever nearly 2
decades ago — and gun deaths plummeted"
and which, despite the headline, goes on to highlight with stats from
-before- the gun law changes (well shit, how can you see a cause if
you don't know the numbers prior to the supposed cause), "Firearm
suicides and homicides did drop after Australia's buyback and
enactment of the NFA. As The Washington Post's Wonkblog has pointed
out, researchers from two different Australian universities found
that, in the decade after the NFA was introduced, the firearm homicide
rate fell by 59% and the firearm suicide rate fell by 65% — without
increases in other types of deaths.
Here's a bigger picture:
australia gun deaths bi Andy Kiersz/Business Insider
Whether the NFA catalyzed that decline, however, is still up for
debate. Over the last several decades, gun deaths in most developed
nations have been trending downward, and studies struggle to determine
how much of the drop resulted from Australia's legislation. Causality
is also inherently difficult to determine in social sciences."
And that graph is, to my eyes, unequivocally compelling - the trend
was already in place, and the Port-Aurthur massacre 'NFA' laws change
did -not- effect that trend in an identifiable way - in fact, it could
well be argued that the change in laws precipitated a steady decline
in the annual reduction of Australian gun-deaths, to the point where
it appears that the decline has all but plateaued - i.e. no more
decline. But what I won't say is that these Australian post Port
Arthur laws caused that plateau - frankly I have no idea, and a proper
study of potential causes would need to be undertaken, if it's
possible at all...
What this graph clearly shows is that it is impossible to conclude
that those Australian post Port Arthur compulsory gun buyback 'NFA'
laws caused any increase in the prior trend of gun death decline
within Australia.
Actually, I do. I live rurally though.
I've lived in Australia for longer than you. So what - that's
irrelevant to the point - whether or not gun-related crime and/ or
deaths has reduced due to Australia's anti-gun policy, or not. We
could also debate whether disarming of the population is a 'good'
thing or not but that would be opinion porn.
Current rates, are not comparative rates. Common sense 1-0-1.
(In case you miss the point - comparative means not between countries,
but comparing the point at issue - Australia's compulsory gun buyback
laws introduction.)
I am not qualified to comment on the statistical significance of this,
nor do I have facts regarding this - although the Lindt Cafe shooting
earlier this year in Sydney may or may not be a relevant data point.
since Port Arthur, I believe the NRA position to be correct. As of
this year, we now have more guns in Australia than we had prior to the
buyback. Again, perhaps not a very useful data point.
Again, comparing countries anecdotally is not the same as analysing
the effects of population disarming laws.
Again hog-wash, since there is no comparison to the pre-disarm-laws.
Unlike the graph I posted above.
Again, I don't know how this is relevant to analysing the efficacy of
gun control laws.
PS: I read in one article the claim that 'unlike America, Australians
don't have a constitutional right to bear arms'. This is actually not
true, just that most people don't know it. Our Australian federal
constitution creates the Commonwealth of Australia, creates each of
the states, creates our superior court (the High Court we call it),
creates our federal parliament, and our High Court, in Mabo 2 (a
ruling from I think 1998) upheld the continuity of the Imperial Acts
including the Bill of Rights 1688, as well as the Magna Charta/ Magna
Carta. Unfortunately, the head of our NRA equivalent sold us out quite
some years back when he proclaimed very publicly "there's nothing we
can" (or words to that effect). Australians - mostly bloody ratbags
acting in total self interest.

SJW = social justice warrior
Islam, Social Justice Warriors and the Cry-Bully
I don't know if Cry-Bullies is the perfect word, but it captures the
dynamic perfectly.
November 7, 2015
Daniel Greenfield
This phenomenon of the abuser-victim is ridiculously widespread these
days. Every Social Justice Warrior that organizes a hate campaign
quickly rushes to friendly media outlets to whine about harassment and
their heroic stand against people doing to them what they do to
others. I'm not sure if Cry-Bully is the best name for it, but I
haven't come up with anything better for it.
That's Julie Burchill's label at the Spectator. I've stripped out most
of the UK pop culture references to focus on the point.
    This is the age of the Cry-Bully, a hideous hybrid of victim and
victor, weeper and walloper. They are everywhere, these duplicit
Pushmi-Pullyus of the personal and the political...
    In the 1970s, there was a big difference between bullies and cry-babies.
     Islamism is the ultimate Cry-Bully cause; on one hand stamping
around murdering anyone who doesn’ t agree with you, on the other hand
yelling ‘ISLAMOPHOBIA’ in lieu of having a real adult debate about the
merits of your case. Their ‘helpline’ is even called Tell Mama –
bless. The British-born Islamist recently sentenced to twelve years
had no problem posing with severed heads (‘Heads, kaffirs,
disgusting’) and asking friends back home to send him condoms which he
planned to use raping women captured as ‘war booty’ but then claimed
to be having nightmares and suffering from depression in order to
escape jail.
I would argue that the same brand of selfishness and dehumanization
that leads to abusive behavior also leads to victimhood.
We've known this about criminals for some time now. They're all
victims. No matter what horrible things they did, someone else always
drove them to it. They're self-centered enough not to care about
anyone else while being exquisitely attuned to their own feelings. As
I wrote a few weeks ago...
    The one thing that Muslim murderers excel at is playing the
victim. Someone always “made” Mohammed do it. Someone got him so
frustrated and upset that he had no choice but to rape and kill.
    There’s a term for the kind of people who think like this;
criminals. There’s a term for the kind of people who defend them;
    The Muslim case for justice can be found in the books of a million
police departments where all the stories begin with the criminal
feeling sorry for himself and end in hospitals and morgues. The story
always begins with, “I wanted what was coming to me” or “She shouldn’t
have made me angry.”
But this isn't limited to Muslims. You can see it in the Black Lives
Matter tantrums. Or the anti-Gamergate crowd. They're the victims and
it's always someone else's fault.
The entire passive aggressive narrative of safe spaces (if you don't
censor people who disagree with us, we're the victims) turns abusers
into victims, censors into heroes defending their mental health from
dissenting views and the victim-victor paradigm is constantly flipping
from one to the other.
One moment the SJW hero is doing an end zone dance over having
defeated the latest cultural enemy. The next moment they're crying
over mean stuff said to them on Twitter. They're narcissistic and
insecure. They want to be treated as helpless heroes, victims of some
terrible social disease (not that kind) that leaves them always out of
power and yet always winning. Their sensitivities have to be
accommodated and censorship is their trophy. They're all about
inclusiveness for special people like them, while driving out and
shutting up anyone who disagrees with them.
I don't know if Cry-Bullies is the perfect word, but it captures the
dynamic perfectly.

New York's Radical Left-Wing Attorney General Plots to Criminalize
Opposing the Left
November 8, 2015
Daniel Greenfield
Here's a little reminder for anyone who doesn't believe that what the
left really wants is a totalitarian state in which opposition to its
agenda is a crime.
New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is extreme even by
left-wing standards. He's a radical who ran by promising that violent
racist thug Al Sharpton would have an "annex" in Albany if he won.
Now Schneiderman and a few left-wing congressmembers have come up with
a great idea. Charge Exxon with securities fraud for not "disclosing"
the risks of Global Warming.
Whether on not any charges happen, this is a foot in the door for an
agenda list that goes well beyond Global Warming.
After energy companies that aren't paying protection money to Al Gore,
gun manufacturers can be hit with charges for not "disclosing the
risks" of gun violence. Private prisons can be hit for not disclosing
the risks of failing to back sentencing reforms. Educational companies
can be hit with charges for not disclosing the risks of not adopting
Common Core.
Basically any company that disagrees with a left-wing policy can be
hit with civil and criminal charges. It helps if the company, like
Exxon, at one point employed kooks who claimed the sky was falling.
But that just makes the case easier. If the executives disagree with a
left-wing policy, it's securities fraud.
Under this standard, it becomes child's play to cut off conservative
organization from any corporate funding. Furthermore, conservative
organizations would be muzzled by extension. Funding organizations and
people that dissent from the left would be "fraud". Because that is
what this is really about.
Global Warming is the testbed for making leftist ideology mandatory.
Manufacture a fake consensus, then use the law to make it mandatory.
Then there can be a pseudo-scientific consensus on a variety of
issues, such as the need for higher taxes, and a crackdown on anyone
who disagrees.
Since there's money in pursuing charges like this, and since the best
way to get the left off your back is to give their political allies
money, this is robbery for tyranny. And that's how the left does
This is where the left has always been headed. This is a totalitarian movement

Why Britain won’t talk about crucial elements of Jihadi John’s story
Ben Hayes 28 February 2015
The role of our security services in the actions of 'Jihadi John'
needs grown up discussion – we must not forget the lessons of Northern
In “Suspect Community: People’s Experience of the Prevention of
Terrorism Acts in Britain”, Professor Paddy Hillyard produced what
remains the world’s most detailed ethnographic study of the impact of
repressive laws and state policies on what we now call
“radicalisation”. That was 1993. Hillyard, a former chair of the
National Council of Civil Liberties (now Liberty), had interviewed
more than 100 people of Irish catholic descent and provided
unequivocal evidence that their everyday treatment at the hands of the
British state had boosted support for Irish republicanism, acted as a
recruiting sergeant for the IRA and fuelled “the Troubles”. Of course
it wasn’t the only “radicalising” factor: Bloody Sunday, a
shoot-to-kill policy and state collusion with Loyalist paramilitaries
also played their part. As of course did the violence, propaganda and
popularity of organisations like the IRA.
We could learn a lot from people like Paddy Hillyard and the
incremental moves toward truth and reconciliation in the north of
Ireland. Instead, this valuable insight is being steadily exorcised
from public debate – as are the similar experiences of Muslim
communities at the hands of the British state.
Yesterday the identity of “Jihadi John”, the ISIS
executioner-in-chief, was revealed to belong to British citizen
Mohammed Emwazi. The human rights group CAGE – the only organisation
in Britain who offers legal support to Muslims who have been
interrogated or harassed by the security services (support which is
readily available to most others questioned by the UK authorities) –
produced a 3,000 word dossier detailing his treatment between 2009 and
2013. This included, inter alia, the surveillance of his movements,
the interception of his telecommunications, the orchestration of his
arrest in Tanzania and transfer to the Netherlands where he was
interrogated by MI5, attempts to coerce him into becoming an MI5
informer, harassment of his family and fiancé, and the prevention of
his resettlement in Kuwait – all in the absence of any formal
allegation, charge or prospect of official recourse.
Since this occurred well before Mohammed Emwazi’s departure from the
UK and appearance in Syria as “Jihadi John”, one might have thought
our media duty bound to ask whether this and other encounters played
any part in his decision to go there. Indeed the most revealing
exchange, which should surely have been on the lips of any journalist
worth their salt, is the following, spoken by MI5 agent “Nick”:
“Listen Mohammed: You’ve got the whole world in front of you; you’re
21 years old; you just finished Uni – why don’t you work for us?” When
Mohammed declines, he is told: “You’re going to have a lot of
trouble... You’re going to be known... you’re going to be followed...
life will be harder for you.”
Let us be clear that whatever else may have transpired since this
exchange, here is a credible allegation of state-sanctioned blackmail
of one of our citizens upon pain of having his life ruined by
unaccountable security forces. When things like this happen to Muslims
in Arab dictatorships, we talk about “secret police” and “fearsome
security apparatuses”. When they happen here, we put our fingers in
our ears and demand that Muslims “get over themselves” and condemn
acts of terrorism.
And so it was that Kay Burley of Sky News duly began her interview
with a CAGE spokesman by asking “What level of harassment by the
security services here in the United Kingdom justifies beheadings?” –
a plainly preposterous straw man argument that literally no-one was
making. Liberal pin-up Jon Snow also glossed over the evidence
produced by CAGE, before getting down to the most important business
of the day: demanding that their spokespeople condemn terrorism, and
seeking to belittle them when they question why this demand is only
ever made of Muslims, or worse still, refuse to participate in the
ridiculous spectacle.
It was already a nailed-on certainty that the government and the media
would turn the “extremist” spotlight onto CAGE and its supporters in a
witch hunt that would make McCarthy blush. But having anointed Peter
Oborne the Supreme Ruler of Media Integrity for taking on the
Telegraph, perhaps they should ask him what he thinks about CAGE’s
treatment at the hands of the establishment. Or reflect on CAGE’s
founder and director’s own experience at the hands of MI5, or his
three-and-a-half years of illegal detention in Guantanamo Bay and
Belmarsh prisons. Nope: they’re just “apologists for terrorism”,
guilty until proven innocent.
Human rights and social justice groups should be supporting CAGE in
its endeavours to uncover the extra-judicial prosecution of the “war
on terror” in this country. They won’t because they’re scared of the
“public perception”. Much easier to support free expression from
behind the comfort of a “Je Suis Charlie” banner. The country should
be having a serious conversation about the way “intelligence-led
policing” has undermined our national security and human rights by
linking the treatment of Mohammed Emwazi to the discredited use of
informants and double agents in Northern Ireland, to the links between
MI5 and extremist groups, and to an undercover culture that has
perverted the pursuit of social and legal justice in this country. It
won’t, because we’ll turn a blind eye to anything at the drop of the
Something fundamental has to change if we’re to have the grown-up
conversations that can inform these policies, and that can temper the
appeal of extremism and violence in all quarters.

We are programmed to tolerate those who do not tolerate us, and tell
us they do not tolerate us, tell us they will kill us, then as
happens, they execute on their plans for execution, jihad, terrorism.
We are so fragile we cry bully for "safe spaces" such as entire
universities, where our particular ('minority') viewpoints are the
only ones that are allowed to be spoken or published by other students
in posters.
We are so lacking in conscience and incompetent to determine what is
right and what is wrong that we must be completely disarmed and the
use of deadly force only to ever be accessible to government-appointed
officers who "keep the peace" and "protect the innocent," as if police
can ever protect an innocent schoolgirl from rape before the fact, or
innocent theater goers from murder at gunpoint - hostages are not

So bring on the silver lining of the hope of a raise in awareness to
the point of action by Joe and Jane sixpack as their hearts are ripped
apart by death and extreme abuse of their near and dear ones, if not

Import substitution applied to software...
Medvedev bans the use of foreign-made software in Russian state agencies
Translated by Ollie Richardson for Fort Russ
20th November, 2015
The Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitry Medevdev, has signed a decree
prohibiting from 1 January 2016 the purchase of foreign-made software
for state needs, reports the press service of the Cabinet.
According to the document, customers will now be obliged to buy
Russian-produced software. It notes that the initiative is a method of
import substitution.
The exception is when software has the necessary functional, technical
or operational characteristics absent in Russia. To place an order on,
for example Microsoft Windows, officials will have to justify the need
for this operating system.
As reported to "Kommersant" earlier, the official, who asked to remain
anonymous,  said that a German IT company began to discuss with the
Ministry of economic development the possibility of  a partial
transfer of software production to Russia, in order thus to be able to
sell it on government orders.
A draft resolution was prepared and submitted by the Ministry of
communications and mass communications of the Russian Federation. It
was presented to Medvedev earlier in April.

Russia Restricts Use of Foreign Software in Battle for ‘Information Sovereignty’
    By Peter Hobson

VedomostiUnder Friday's order, authorities will draw up a register of
Russian computer programs that will verify the Russianness of software
and promote its use.
Russian officials will be barred from using foreign software from next
year if a Russian version exists. The move, which is aimed at boosting
Russia's national security and the country's tech industry, could cost
foreign firms hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenues.
The rules apply to local and national government entities and come
into force on Jan. 1, 2016, according to an order signed by Prime
Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the government's website on
The order is part of a drive to wean Russia off imports in key areas
of industry that was accelerated after Moscow's falling out with the
West over Ukraine last year.
It is also linked to fears of spying and sabotage by foreign
intelligence services, who are feared to have access to software and
equipment developed in their countries. This anxiety has led to calls
to boycott iPhones, build a Russian operating system to rival
Microsoft's Windows, and tighten control of the Internet.
As Communications and Mass Media Minister Nikolai Nikiforov put it a
year ago: "We stand for complete sovereignty of information."
Under Friday's order, authorities will draw up a register of Russian
computer programs that will verify the Russianness of software and
promote its use.
Foreign software giants such as SAP, Oracle, IBM and Microsoft
recorded sales in Russia worth around $1.4 billion last year,
accounting for some three-quarters of the market, according to news
agency RBC. This included sales worth 20 billion rubles ($300 million)
to government entities, the Kommersant newspaper reported.
It is not clear how much foreign-made software has no analogue in
Russia, but the government is promoting local production. It also
seeks to train more programmers, though the most talented often end up
in the tech hubs of California.
Earlier this month Kommersant obtained a letter from the Association
of European Businesses, a Moscow lobby group, warning that the planned
law restricting use of non-Russian software would likely see foreign
companies freeze investment or pull out of Russia.

We would say "no law making such activity illegal, no violation."
This matches Richard Stallman's position that the GPL relies on
copyright law, which it does - it is the original hack of copyright
law to manifest an idea, an ideal, which idea and ideal I happen to
agree with.
(Can't immediately find a link, but he has answered this question
before, ie "would you get rid of copyright law" - with the answer
being "no, because the GPL relies upon it.")
That is just fine, that's a good thing - resources are being kept in
Russia, for Russians. And then the only question is efficiency of
government spending, which is an entirely different and solvable
problem - for example as long as the government makes transparent its
spending, then "installation services of GPL software" would soon
enough be seen as lucrative pursuit, and competition would
(presumably) arise for said installation (and customization) services,
and the costs to government should normalize, that is the costs should
normalize around relatively low installation/ customization/ training
services, rather than the cost of proprietary software rent-seekers
such as Microsoft, SAP and Oracle. This again will be a very good
thing for Russia and for Russians. More countries should follow this
lead of Russia - in fact it is in everyone's interest.
It is easy for me to say this is not true - but the assertion is a
'should' and is too broad. The GPL in fact relies upon law of
copyright. Copyright is one form of proprietary monopoly "right" which
is artificial, not natural - that is, except for "law" based
enforcement, it does not exist naturally. A coal mine is a natural
monopoly in the area that it exists, but there are many coal
locations, so coal has plenty of competition and transport is cheap,
so no actual monopoly.
GPL is clever - it uses "artificial (statutory) monopoly right" in a
unique way - essentially to apply the minimum number of restrictions
on redistribution of e.g. source code, in order to maximise the
availability of source code to the whole community, over the long
term. That's pretty cool. In the face of statutory monopolies and rent
seekers around the world, this is an effective hack to broaded the
free libre software source code base. That's a good thing.
This paper takes a new look at the debate over commons and property in
information and communications. It warns against recreating the old
communist–capitalist ideological divide by framing the movement for
informational commons as “info–communist.” The spectre of communism
haunts the movement because of an unresolved ideological tension in
its ethical and philosophical foundations. The case for free software
and open information contains both deontological appeals to the
virtues of sharing, and consequentialist arguments against the growing
intrusiveness of the institutional and technological mechanisms used
to enforce exclusivity in the digital economy. The paper argues that
the deontological case is a dead end that leads to info–communism. The
strongest case for open access and freedom in information and
communications is grounded in a liberalism that takes maximizing
individual freedom as its objective and relies on creative
complementarities between property and commons regimes as means to
that end."
Perhaps you can spread the word that "overpriced services" is not only
OK by the GPL, but encouraged. "Charge as much as you can.":
It is still so much better than pumping money into proprietary
freedom-denying community-compromising software that you might get
from Apple and Microsoft.
Military probably gets to do what it wants, without much question.
BUT, these examples and others, are examples of opportunity to build a
little GPL-enforcing community in Russia, perhaps send a letter to the
president (currently Putin), or simply to jump on the free libre
software bandwagon and make some money - but showing how to do it
right, with respect of original authors' intentions as expressed by
the respective software licenses.
This move by the Russian government is an excellent move, make no
doubt. Those Russians who can make money from it, can do so with their
heads held high, in dignity and with rightful respect from the rest of
the world. Go to it! Service your government and make some clean
money!! You have the blessings of the large global free libre software
community, the Free Software Foundation, etc.

Banning rights (eg to purchase particular software) of private
citizens is perhaps not the smartest thing for any government to do,
soviet/ communist or otherwise - the heavy hand (always?) produces
I agree there are many typical (and actual) problems of government. It
is good to separate different problems in our minds, so we can attack
(if we have will) the problems properly, and so maximise the benefits
to ourselves and to our country.
That is: it is right for a government to spend the peoples' money
(taxes) only on software which the people will thereafter have an
indefinite right to use (libre software, even if 'improperly' sold
with deception of license). And it is right for a government to
maximise the spending of its peoples' money on software which is
developed and or serviced in any way by the people of that country -
maximise internal velocity of the country's wealth. This is economic
rationalism at national level.
This is the softer hand - encouragement by the carrot of money.
Transparency problems? "Hidden single vendor" problems? Other
problems? These problems will happen for foreign proprietary software
as well... they are separate problems. Solve each problem, but don't
stop your government from promoting something good with government
contracts/ government spending, just because there are additional
problems to solve. It might sound funny, but Russia is not Czech, and
Putin is not that stupid. This particular policy of Russian government
does not decrease individual/ private rights like the heavy handed
Czech republic example you give, and this Russian policy correctly
tries to improve on government spending of Russian taxes - it is a
correct approach, within the boundary of existing Russian government.
Perhaps find a talented young teenager who likes creative graphics
software and designs a desktop skin for e.g. Debian GNU/Linux, and
help it to become popular, make a hero of this young designer, because
people like heroes. Probably needs to look like Windows XP :)  (so
that people are at least partly familiar with it), or perhaps Mac.
When I install Debian for people, I usually install XFCE desktop with
full top menu bar and Cairo Dock, libre office, tor browser/ firefox,
chromium and VLC. This covers most needs of most people - advanced
users have to help themselves a bit more, but less advanced users only
need nice and relatively simple GUI, which XFCE+CairoDock provides.
Perhaps provide this type of setup as a services company to government
departments - start with municipal or smaller level, and build your
company up from there. Provide some "mandatory training" to
council/govt staff, employ local computer geeks (perhaps yourself to
start) - make snazzy PDF brochure. Franchise/ expand to other areas in
your city, then other cities. Keep respectful public profile on
important mailing lists so you can solve your client problems quickly.
Promote the employment that you have created.
There are many opportunities. Russian government just made it a little
easier to take advantage of some opportunities at the same time as
building your company on free libre software. This is a very good
thing. A door has been opened. Walk through it.

The practices of this yoga regime must be corrected.
Zenaan's trigger warnings: contains the following words and phrases:
spiritual, oppression, cultural genocide, yoga, cultural issues,
Disabilities (I was so sure we weren't allowed to use that word any
more), feeling left out, mindful stretching (evidently a taboo phrase
as well).
A yoga instructor who teaches at the University of Ottawa says she is
fighting to keep her program alive after the school’s student body
suspended it over concerns that “cultural issues” relating to the
class could offend students.
Jennifer Scharf, who has been offering free weekly sessions at the
university’s Center for Students with Disabilities since 2008, told
the Ottawa Sun that she was informed in September that the program
would not come back for the fall semester.
    ICYMI: Still our hottest story – Free yoga class cancelled over
'cultural issues'      — Ottawa Sun ( November 23, 2015
In an email exchange between Scharf and a representative of the
university’s Student Federation — which was viewed by the newspaper —
a student wrote that “while yoga is a really great idea and accessible
and great for students… there are cultural issues of implication
involved in the practice.
“Yoga has been under a lot of controversy lately due to how it is
being practiced,” the email continues, and which cultures those
practices “are being taken from.”
The Student Federation, which operates the center, went on to say that
many of those cultures “have experienced oppression, cultural genocide
and diasporas due to colonialism and Western supremacy… we need to be
mindful of this and how we express ourselves while practicing yoga.”
Student Federation Acting President Romeo Ahimakin told the Ottawa Sun
that the class has been put on hold until a way can be figured out “to
make it better, more accessible and more inclusive to certain groups
of people that feel left out in yoga-like spaces.
“We are trying to have those sessions done in a way in which students
are aware of where the spiritual and cultural aspects come from, so
that these sessions are done in a respectful manner,” he added.
But Scharf, who instructed about 60 students each week in the program,
said, “people are just looking for a reason to be offended by anything
they can find.”
Scharf says she offered the student body leaders a compromise by
suggesting she change the name of the course to “mindful stretching,”
but after some debate, they couldn’t reach an agreement.
“I guess it was this cultural appropriation issue because yoga
originally comes from India,” she told CBC News. “We’re not going
through the finer points of Scripture. We’re talking about basic
physical awareness and how to stretch so that you feel good.”
Scharf added that she is “fighting so hard” to keep the class.

Putin: Russia will not tolerate such crimes as attack against its
Sukhoi-24 plane
November 24, 15:53 UTC+3
According to the president, the attack against Su-24 plane in Syria
goes beyond normal struggle against terrorism, and it is "a stab in
Russia’s back" delivered by "terrorism accomplices"
SOCHI, November 24. /TASS/. Russia will not tolerate crimes like the
attack on the Russian Su-24 fighter jet shot down by the Turkish Air
Force in Syrian skies, President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday at a
meeting with King of Jordan Abdullah II.
"I understand each country has its own regional interests, and we have
always respected that. But we shall never tolerate crimes like today's
one," the president said.
The Russian leader stressed that the downed fighter-bomber was posing
no threat to Turkey.
"Our pilots and jet posed no threat to the Turkish Republic. This is
obvious. They were conducting an operation against ISIL," Putin said.
He stressed the plane was flying above northern Lattakia where
militants coming from Russia are concentrated.
"The Russian bomber was shot down over Syria by an air-to-air surface
fired from a Turkish F-16 plane when the bomber was at an altitude of
6,000 meters at a distance of 1 km from the Turkish bomber." Putin
"They [the pilots] were fulfilling their task," the president stressed
adding that they were delivering preventive air strikes on terrorists
who can come back to Russia at any moment.
Putin called the attack a crime and stressed that Russia would not
tolerate it. According to the president, the Su-24 plane crash in
Syria goes beyond normal struggle against terrorism, and it is "a stab
in Russia’s back delivered by terrorist accomplices."
"Today’s loss is linked with a stab in our back delivered by terrorism
accomplices. I can’t characterize otherwise what has happened today,"
the Russian leader said.
According to the president, Russia has long been aware of oil supplies
to Turkey from Syria’s territories seized by terrorists, which
provided tangible financial support for the extremists.
"We’ve long exposed heavy trafficking of oil and petroleum products
from Islamic State-seized territories," Putin said, adding that
monetary support for the militant groups was large, indeed.

"Now we’ve suffered stabs in the back: attacks against our planes that

Russia’s Sukhoi-24 although "we have signed agreements with the
American partners on the prevention of incidents in the air, and
Turkey, as is known, is among the countries that have declared they
are ostensibly fighting against terrorism within the US-led
Putin noted that Turkey’s contacts with NATO member states after the
attack against the Russian aircraft look like an attempt to make the
alliance serve terrorists.
The Russian leader said that instead of immediately establishing
contacts with Russia after the bomber incident, "the Turkish side
applied to its NATO partners to discuss this issue, as far as we
"It seems as if we have shot down a Turkish plane and not vice versa,"
the Russian president said.
"So, does this mean that they want NATO to serve the Islamic State?"
Putin noted.
The president said the attack on the Russian jet will have tragic
consequences to Russia-Turkey ties.
"We will certainly carefully analyse what has happened and today’s
tragic event will have serious consequences to Russian-Turkish
relations," he said. According to Putin, Russia has always treated
Turkey not simply as a close neighbour, but as a friendly state.
"I have no idea who needed what has happened today, but in any case
it’s not us," the Russian president said.
He expressed hope "the international community will find the forces to
unite in the face of this common evil (terrorism)."

"ACT OF WAR: Turkey Shoots Down Russian Military Jet

A NATO member just shot down a Russian military jet...
Absolutely unreal news coming from Syria: Turkish F-16 fighters have
shot down a Russian Su-24 tactical bomber. The details:
        Turkey has shot down a Russian military jet which it says violated
its airspace near the Syrian border.
    The Russian Defence Ministry and Turkish Presidency, quoted in
Russian and Turkish media reports, have both described the plane as
Russian, and video posted by the Haberturk TV station appeared to show
the jet coming down in flames.
    A military official, quoted by Turkey's Dogan news agency, said
the plane was shot down by Turkish F16s, and that the pilot was given
prior warning.
    Various reports described the plane as coming down in hostile
Syrian territory, and the fate of the two pilots on board was unknown.
Initial reports claim that the pilots successfully ejected and are
safe. But the story is developing.
The Russian Ministry of Defense says that it has proof that the plane
was flying in Syrian, not Turkish, airspace at the time of the attack.
We cannot emphasize enough how jaw-droppingly dumb Turkey is: A NATO
member just shot down a Russian military jet.
UPDATE: A video has surfaced claiming to show the body of one of the
pilots. The fate of the second pilot is still unknown.

Russian pilots who were shot down over Syria by Turkey earlier today
is dead. The below video allegedly shows the west's favorite “moderate

apparently was able to eject from the plane but did not survive.

Power, money, electricity and other assorted tools of human
experience. May we each act wisely.
Most don't get to choose in what nation they be. But within many
limits we have specific freedoms - we can make certain choices.
Let's look at it this way - could the key be to know one's conscience
(knowledge of good and evil), to bind oneself to good, and to exercise
as much power as is within one's domain of action, in the pursuit of
good and to make no compromise (to expedience or otherwise)?
Bind oneself, then bind those entities such as corporations one
creates, to good. Google began by stating such an intent ("do no evil"
as was proudly proclaimed) then later, the individuals in control of
(the power of) Google-the-corporation, they surrendered that control,
surrendered their sovereignty, for an "Initial Public Offering", i.e.
for money, to cash out, i.e. for the short term gain of money and
shares, and compromising on principle of "do no evil" to something
much lesser (grow the company more quickly than would happen naturally
otherwise, try to do some good in China by providing search services,
but whilst compromising Google's fundamental principle to achieve
these ends).
Google's founders compromised their foundation ethic, in essence
saying "the ends (intended or hoped for result) justifies the means
(compromise of principle)". Almost all humans we see today, who attain
a position of power, make at a minimum, this type of compromise, if
not much greater/ worse compromises.
I bind myself to never making a compromise of the highest principle I
am able to conceive. If I can't do it "right", I won't do it - there
is always something else I can do, and do it "right". When we of
competence in this world involve ourselves with one another, let us
cause each other to bind strongly to the highest "good" principles we
are able to conceive, and to never make any compromise of expedience,
and to implement technical measures to support these binds to the
greatest extent of our ability (e.g. digital canaries). Let us be
clear and bold and public in our binds, proclaiming to the world those
principles for which we stand and for which we spend our life energy
and for which we spend our attention.
In these ways may we live in dignity and strive for something higher
than only comfort for our physical bodies. In these ways may we
inspire those who come after us.

Damn how humans can be scary. If Intelligence at one end of a scale
(e.g. "inability to grok a concept, say 'filter', leading to
aggression leading to lynching") is a threat to me (who might not grok
filter, but at least recognises it's just a word), then intelligence
towards the other end of the scale might well be seen as a threat to
those towards the first end of the scale.
I guess that's why all "great" revolutionaries (Pol Pot, Stalin, Mao)

area where the Russian Su-24 jet moderately crashed in Syria after

General Wesley Clark: Wars Were Planned - Seven Countries In Five Years
(Although I paste the transcript here, I find this interview quite
enjoyable to watch, and it's only 8MB, although the video does not
include the last couple sentences from the transcript, and the video
does add separate little section of its own, again General Wesley;
"General Wesley Clark:
Because I had been through the Pentagon right after 9/11. About ten
days after 9/11, I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary
Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. I went downstairs just to say
hello to some of the people on the Joint Staff who used to work for
me, and one of the generals called me in. He said, "Sir, you've got to
come in and talk to me a second." I said, "Well, you're too busy." He
said, "No, no." He says, "We've made the decision we're going to war
with Iraq." This was on or about the 20th of September. I said, "We're
going to war with Iraq? Why?" He said, "I don't know." He said, "I
guess they don't know what else to do." So I said, "Well, did they
find some information connecting Saddam to al-Qaeda?" He said, "No,
no." He says, "There's nothing new that way. They just made the
decision to go to war with Iraq." He said, "I guess it's like we don't
know what to do about terrorists, but we've got a good military and we
can take down governments." And he said, "I guess if the only tool you
have is a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail."
So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were
bombing in Afghanistan. I said, "Are we still going to war with Iraq?"
And he said, "Oh, it's worse than that." He reached over on his desk.
He picked up a piece of paper. And he said, "I just got this down from
upstairs" -- meaning the Secretary of Defense's office -- "today." And
he said, "This is a memo that describes how we're going to take out
seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria,
Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran." I said, "Is
it classified?" He said, "Yes, sir." I said, "Well, don't show it to
me." And I saw him a year or so ago, and I said, "You remember that?"
He said, "Sir, I didn't show you that memo! I didn't show it to you!"
(Looking at youtube, there appears quite a few talks by General Wesley Clark.)

"the citizens of ... Crimea are not Putin's own people" - this
position is too broad, and too unqualified to be factual or useful.
"invasion" of Ukarine? Again, you'll need to qualify that assertion in
order to sustain it. For example, Russia protecting the safety of the
people in the running of a referendum in Crimea, without a shot fired
and without a single person killed by the so-called 'invasion', in an
area which is 80%+ Russian speaking, and where the majority of people
turned out to vote (in stressful circumstances) and where the vast
majority of those voting, voted to secede from Ukraine and reunite
with Russia - facilitating the expression of the will of the people is
an example of something we in the West might consider to be
democratic. I -wish- for such respect for the will of the people here
in Australia for example!
Yes accept that this referendum was in the economic and/ or military
interest of Russia, and that we are unlikely to see a repeat of such
an event. Still, it's a very classy thing for Russia to have done,
politically... and very far from an "invasion".
The elite in my home country Australia for example, are afraid of the
people. Last year one of our federal politicians used the
implementation of direct democracy as a threat. We have been disarmed
after Port Arthur. We are treated as sheep by our media.

We can do better than this. For a start, let's not paper of Azov

of the situation in Ukraine, we might need to broaden our diet beyond
the Western media?
We can do better. For the sake of sanity, we MUST do better, or we
shall be hypocrites to our own higher ideals.
If you said "not exempt from the potential for corruption in his
ranks", then I could agree with you.
But when you make an allegation against an individual, in this case

corruption", then for a semblence of intellectual honesty, at least

allegations - that is reducing our selves to the level of the Western
media, and not in our interest, and not in the interests of the
peoples of the world.)

stick out like a swore thumb, but odds are good the cops can bust them

ALA SENATE CANDIDATE STRUTS HIS STUFF
THE PICKERING POST
Larry Pickering
Fri 27 Nov 2015
Outspoken ex-military Senate candidate, Bernard Gaynor, faced a large
crowd on Queensland’s Gold Coast this week to launch his campaign for
the newly-formed Australian Liberty Alliance party which is looming as
a force in the upcoming Federal election.
Mr Gaynor spoke mainly about public concern over Islamic immigration.
There is certainly a world-wide movement gaining political momentum on
this issue and the current Labor and liberal parties are certain to
join in moving against any viable threat to their comfortable duopoly,
as they have with ruthless efficiency in the past.
This is the text of what Mr Gaynor had to say:
Ladies and gentleman, Australia is facing a crisis.
It is a crisis that threatens all of us right now. And it is a crisis
that threatens our children most of all because they will have to live
with the decisions we make today.
This crisis comes from Islamic ideology.
For far too long, our government has pretended that Islamic ideology
is peaceful. Our political leaders have pretended that this ideology
can be integrated safely into our society.
But they have been wrong.
Any student of history knows that this belief is wrong. Islam was
founded by a man who brilliantly merged politics with religion and
created an empire where the church was the state. In the process, an
army was raised, wars were fought, and populations were enslaved,
forcibly converted or executed.
This man was Mohammad and the Islamic religion teaches that he was
perfect and that his example is to be followed. There should be no
surprises, therefore, that the Islamic religion leads to violence. It
idolises a warlord.
It should also come as no surprise that this religion advocates
immigration into non-Islamic lands as a means of conquering them. The
Islamic calendar itself is based on the first successful conquest
undertaken by Islamic immigration: the conquest of Medina.
For much of the last three centuries, all of this has been forgotten.
Then September 11 happened.
Unfortunately, the Western world believed that September 11 was
something new. But it was not. It was something old.
In fact, in the first battle of September 11 was in 1683. This was the
first September 11.
On that first September 11, European forces defeated an invading
Islamic army that had been besieging Vienna for two months. Those of
you who know Europe will know that the city of Vienna is right in the
middle of the continent. It is not an understatement to say that this
victory saved Europe.
After this first battle of September 11, the Islamic threat to Europe
receded due to the efforts of those who protected Western
civilisation, until it was forgotten. But before this first battle of
September 11, Europe was constantly threatened by Islam, just as it is
In fact, Vienna was under constant attack for 150 years prior to that
first battle of September 11 in 1683.
The Battle of Lepanto occurred in 1571. It saved Europe from an
Islamic fleet sent to invade Italy.
In 1453, the city of Constantinople fell. It has been the capital of
the Byzantine Empire since Roman days. It finally succumbed after a
700 year fight against Islamic aggression. Now this empire and its
culture is gone.
The Spanish also battled Islam for about 700 years. That’s how long it
took to remove Islam after it arrived with the Caliph’s armies shortly
after Mohammad’s death. The year that Columbus discovered America was
also the year that Islam was eventually removed from Spain. Now it is
walking in again via Europe’s open borders.
Mohammad died in the year 632. Within five years, Jerusalem had been
captured and in the next century Islam had conquered the Persians, the
Egyptians, all of North Africa, Spain and had even reached into the
heart of France.
In 732, at a place called Tours in Northern France, this first Islamic
invasion was finally stopped but as we can see through history, it was
not the last.
We face another invasion today.
September 11 shows that we are once again under attack.
So does Bali. And Madrid. And London.
So do the terrorist atrocities on our home soil, in Melbourne, in
Sydney’s Martin Place and at Parramatta.
And two attacks in Paris this year show that appeasing the enemy only
makes things worse.
Yet our politicians, our government and our security organisations
remain obstinately and wilfully determined to ignore the reality of
this crisis and the threat that we face.
Let me give you three examples.
The first example is that of our Prime Minister.
Our Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has been talking a lot about
Islam lately. And every time he does, he shows how ill-equipped and
unprepared he is for the task at hand of protecting Australia and
In early October, Prime Minister Turnbull announced that he was going
to ‘reset’ relations with the Islamic community. By the end of the
day, a police worker lay dead outside Parramatta police station as a
result of an attack launched from the Parramatta mosque.
Undeterred, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced a National Day
of Unity in late October, where Australians were invited to welcome
the Islamic community. The very next day, Hizb ut Tahrir held a
conference attended by nearly 1000 people and announced that they
rejected Australia, and rejected our values, our laws, our flag and
our anthem.
Just so you know, this organisation, Hizb ut Tahrir, has been
supported by almost every Islamic organisation or imam in Australia,
including the Grand Mufti, Australia’s highest ranking Islamic figure.
The truth is that Hizb ut Tahrir is the political wing of an Islamic
insurgency intent on overthrowing our system of government.
Then the Prime Minister flew to Europe and rejected calls for European
nations to shut their borders to an Islamic invasion.
Within a couple of days, 130 people lay dead in Paris and hundreds
more were wounded. These attacks were carried out by immigrants who
lived in France, but who never became French.
And now, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull wants us to negotiate a
political settlement in Syria. He thinks the Islamic State can be
dealt with by nothing more than words.
As such, it is clear that the Prime Minister, installed by the
majority of his Liberal party colleagues, has simply no idea about the
nature of Islamic ideology or how we should confront its attacks on
The second example relates to government funding of Islam in this
country. This is just a small example of how your taxes are spent:
The federal government has provided millions over the last five years
to ‘deradicalisation’ programs. Only one out of 87 of these programs
actually deals with radicalised individuals. The remainder actually
promote Islam. Some of these programs over the last 12 months are:
$120,000 has been provided for an Australian Rules Football
competition open only to Islamic schools.
$114,820 has been provided to tackle violence between Islamic sects
within the Islamic community.
$115,700 has been allocated to a program called People Against Violent
Extremism. It tackles extremism by trying to ‘deradicalise’ those who
oppose the construction of new mosques in their local community.
$56,500 was allocated to SalamCare. This group is led by a person who
wrote Allahu Akbar on their Facebook page when the Islamic State
announced that it had formed the caliphate and it campaigns against
radicalisation by trying to stop people like the courageous Dutch
politician, Geert Wilders, from coming to Australia.
Over $1 million has been allocated by the Attorney-General’s
Department to pay for the legal fees of those facing terrorism charges
or who are being questioned by ASIO.
Over $15 million was allocated to improve school security last year.
Islamic schools made up the vast majority of schools to receive
funding for this project.
$66,000 was provided by the Australian Federal Police to the Lebanese
Muslim Association. This organisation has hosted a US-based imam who
has stated:
“If we put a nationwide infrastructure in place and marshalled our
resources, we’d take over this country in a very short time….What a
great victory it will be for Islam to have this country in the fold
and ranks of the Muslims.”
Over $165 million was given to Islam-sympathetic groups by Centrelink
to help resettle migrants in Australia in the last 12 months.
And the Queensland government is now funding mosque open days.
The list goes on. The Prime Minister doesn’t understand the threat.
And our government uses our taxes to fund and promote Islam. This
helps to explain why, despite the billions that we spend on this
problem, it is only getting worse.
The third example is that of our Australian Army.
It is now removing a motto from the hat badges of its Christian
chaplains because it has been deemed offensive to Muslims.
This motto is “In this sign conquer”.
The appeasement within the military comes just a few months after the
appointment of the first imam in the Australian Defence Force, Sheikh
Mohammadu Nawas Saleem.
Saleem is one of Australia’s most prominent imams. He is the treasurer
of the Australian National Imams Council and works very closely with
the Grand Mufti.
And Sheikh Saleem has called for Sharia law to implemented in Australia.
He has supported Hizb ut Tahrir publicly. This is the same Hizb ut
Tahrir that says Muslims must not attend Anzac Day because it
represents an attack on the caliphate. This is the same Hizb ut Tahrir
that defends the concept of honour killings.
Sheikh Saleem has opposed military action against the Islamic State.
And he has condemned laws that prohibit the advocation of terrorism on
the basis that they limit the free speech of Islamic preachers.
And the Liberal government appointed this imam to the military. His
job is to help increase recruitment from the Islamic community.
Just so you know, the Islamic community has more of its sons fighting
for the Islamic State than for Australia.
All of these examples highlight how unprepared our political leaders,
our government and our military is to deal with the threat of Islamic
And if they won’t defend against Islamic violence, then we are also
wide open for subversion in other ways: through the implementation of
halal certification, through the acceptance of polygamy via
Centrelink, through the indoctrination of our children in the national
If our government cannot bring itself to understand the violence of
Islam, it will never be able to defend itself against the non-violent
but equally subversive political threat that Islam poses in a
But I have not come here today to tell you how bad things are.
You already know it. Australians everywhere already understand this.
What we desperately need is a solution and that is why I am here
because the Australian Liberty Alliance is that solution.
The Australian Liberty Alliance will stand up to the threat of Islam
and we will do this while Australia still has time to act. It is
important to understand this. The problems in Australia are there, but
they are not as great as those faced by Europe.
So we have a window of opportunity to act and for the future of our
children, we must.
This is the Australian Liberty Alliance’s plan.
The Australian Liberty Alliance will stop Islamic immigration.
It will do this by imposing a moratorium on immigration from any
countries that are members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation,
with exceptions only for persecuted non-Muslims from those countries.
The Australian Liberty Alliance will axe the halal certification tax.
It will do this by scrapping all halal certification fees and forcing
the Islamic community to pay for its own religious offices. That will
kill the profit taking. And it will force producers to clearly label
their products and explain to Australians that the food they buy –
especially meat – has been produced as part of an Islamic animal
sacrifice. This will kill demand and halal certification will simply
The Australian Liberty Alliance will reject any government support for
Sharia law, in law and in practice.
That means there will be no more welfare for polygamous Islamic
families, no segregation of women, no female genital mutilation and
none of the other Islamic practices that are incompatible with
Australian culture and society.
The Australian Liberty Alliance will put an end to the construction of
dangerous new mosques and Islamic schools.
It will force Islamic organisations to sign up to a Charter of Muslim
Understanding, which will require these organisations to reform Islam
so that it no longer acts as a violent political ideology, if they
wish to be classified as religious organisations. And the party will
work with local governments to introduce proper and stringent risk
assessments into the development planning process.
This means that without reform of Islam, and I doubt that will ever
happen, there will be no new mosques and existing mosques will face
the prospect of being shut down.
The Australian Liberty Alliance will also address the threat of
terrorism by addressing the problem: Islam.
Our intelligence and security agencies will be directed to gain a true
understanding of Islam, rather than the politically-correct version
that they pretend into existence today. These organisations will no
longer be allowed to promote this religion or its ideas.
And the Australian Liberty Alliance will start using treachery laws
against those who support the Islamic State and other Islamic
terrorist groups against our own Defence Force.
All of these measures could be implemented today. And if they were,
the problem we face would not grow and the serious troublemakers
within the Islamic community would be neutralised, while the remainder
of the Islamic community would soon get the message: get on board with
Team Australia, or face the full force of the law. Most of them want
to and we welcome that.
The situation within Australia is containable if we act today. If we
wait until 2020 or 2025, it may well be too late.
Unfortunately, these decisions are not being taken because our current
leaders do not understand the problem and they do not have the will to
act. They are lethargic in the face of the enemy.
Australians deserve much better and that is what the Australian
Liberty Alliance will provide: an energy to act, driven by a proud and
uncompromising belief in our Western Christian civilisation.
Unlike the others, the Australian Liberty Alliance is proud that it is
proud of Australia.
As a result, the Australian Liberty Alliance is not just addressing
the big picture. Its policies, intent and resolve will also address
the problems that Australians face in their local communities: like
right here on the Gold Coast.
For instance, the Gold Coast Mayor, Tom Tate, has been quoted in
Islamic webpages outlining a vision where entire suburbs convert to
Islam in order to bring in Islamic tourists.
I say this: Tom Tate might as well strap a suicide vest to the Gold
Coast’s tourism industry. I grew up in Southport. I love this city and
I know why people come here. It is not because of Islam. Sharia
tourism will kill the Gold Coast. These ideas must be stopped and as
the Australian Liberty Alliance grows it will work with local Gold
Coast residents to run strong campaigns for good local representatives
to be elected to council so that they can fight this dangerous
political correctness.
This is how we must protect ourselves from Islam: and not just Islam’s
threat of violence, but the danger it also offers against our economic
security and our social fabric.
Of course, the Australian Liberty Alliance is more than a party
focused on Islam.
It is not a single issue party. It has a conservative philosophy and
policies that will help Australians in other ways. Its vision is for a
smaller, decentralised government that does not leave a legacy of debt
for future generations.
It believes in reform of the tax system. At the moment debate is
focused solely on new taxes. The Australian Liberty Alliance believes
that it is more important to look at how current taxes are spent and
how the grants system allows government funds to flow into projects
that have no responsibility, accountability or oversight.
It will sell the SBS to the highest bidder and put a broom through the ABC.
The Australian Liberty Alliance will support natural families and
reform welfare so that it is not used as a substitute for work, but so
that it also provides Australian families with more choice and
opportunity to spend time with their children raising them.
It will not waste billions trying to control the level of the oceans,
yet the Australian Liberty Alliance’s environmental policies will have
the exact same impact on the climate as those of other parties.
The Australian Liberty Alliance will address the flaws in our
education system and refocus our schools so that they teach the basics
exceptionally well and this will set the foundation for exceptional
higher educational studies.
These are all ideas that the Australian Liberty Alliance will
champion. And our political system needs debate about these ideas.
At the moment, the major parties have a monopoly on debate. They are
the Coles and Woolworths of politics, screwing down on the voters.
Their efforts and endeavours are not about providing customer service
or better products. Instead, they focused solely on maintain their
monopoly on power. We desperately need an Aldi to come and shake up
the system.
That is what the Australian Liberty Alliance will do and by doing so,
it will provide Australians with a brighter future.
That future starts at the next election. Between now and then I will
be working night and day to campaign for the Australian Liberty
Alliance and I hope you will join me in that campaign.
We need to build a strong team on the Gold Coast and across
Queensland. This campaign will not be successful if it is a one man
band. But it will succeed if we work as a team and the turn out
tonight shows that we are well and truly on the way to building this
team, this army of patriotic Australians. I look forward to growing
that team on the Gold Coast from tonight.
I also thank you for coming tonight. I thank for you for already
standing tall and fighting hard for Australia. And I thank you for
your support of the Australian Liberty Alliance.

I agree that religion nearly always degenerates into control of its
"followers" in more or less degraded and degrading ways. The Tibetans
on the whole are (from what I've read) much better off under the
system imposed by the Chinese than they were under the system imposed
by Lamas, "Lamaism" ultimately under the Dalai Lama.
To excessively generalise, and to stick to "at this point in history,
as in, 2015 AD", could you agree that the current manifestation of
"Islamists" (i.e. those extreme individuals professing faith in
Islam), is in fact problematic for the "reasonably comfortable"
Christian/ democratic "west"?
Recently Russia has implemented some significant changes in Crimea,
replacing the Turkish Imam with a new Russian Imam, building a new
large mosque, and I think also some other legislative measures.
Russia seems to approach "Islamism", by 'implementing' it's version of
Islam and importing a "truly moderate" Imam.
My question might be getting lost. Perhaps, do you consider it
sensible to distinguish between moderates and extremists of any
If so, given the current extreme level of emigration from Syria, Libya
and other Muslim areas of our little planet, is there some wisdom in
attempting to distinguish between true moderates and extremists or
even "likely to be extremists"?
I problem I see is that in our 'modern' 'democratic' striving for
'secularism', we in the so called west have given up on morals and
ethics ('goodness as each individual conceives goodness') for an
extreme relativism, where no one really takes any stand for anything,
and it appears to me that "evil" paths of action are pursued by
western powers (companies, individuals, nations) in the pursuit of
power, oil, control.
And the settlers in Tasmania systematically slaughtered the aborigines
of Tasmania (an island state of Australia). Heinous crimes. Genocide
of the first order.
Yes, humans can be a problem. In fact, humans usually are the primary problem.
To handle the genuine problem of violent immigrants and the difficulty
in properly assessing individuals for the violent potential, perhaps a
contractual bind - you want to be here, you sign and agree to:
- not engage in criminal acts as defined by our statutory criminal code
- if you engage in any criminal act according to our statutory
criminal code, you will be immediately deported to the country you
were allegedly fleeing
The "Christian" ethic of "turn the other cheek" can be, and I say is,
abused. Abused by our politicians, abused by our schooling
institutions turning us into compliant citizens. And abused by those
who immigrate to Australia with intent to implement "emigration jihad"
which by my readings, is a religious duty, at least for some Muslims
(or is that Islamists? - too many terms sorry).
I agree. This is a straightforward and logical position. And it's the
violent acts that need to be handled, and ideally minimise the entry
of violent people into our country.
Can we identify violent people amongst those who are attempting to
immigrate? Some people say we shouldn't distinguish between "good" and
"bad" inclined people - they are just poor refugees fleeing war and
who have suffered (which may be true) and we ought to suffer them
regardless - I disagree with unlimited tolerance and acceptance of all
beliefs, all positions - violent positions and violent beliefs are not
only held, but preached, believed and acted upon.
A policy to deter violence by immigrants:
If they commit any violent crime, immediate deportation ought be mandatory.
And an indicator may, for a not so random example, Sudanese Muslims.
But all you can do is assess areas and people for indicators - I think
a deterrent as suggested above is what's needed.
And I think that without such deterrents, and an excess of immigrants
who commit crimes, the problems may lead to vigilante reprisal groups
- which may well have its own problems (people taking the law into
their own hands, without evidence, trials, witnesses - nothing - is
this where we want to head?).
I can only agree - it is abhorrent actions which ought be handled.
Political correctness however casts a great dampener on much
"political" debate in Australia, but that's another problem...

How do people live, what do they believe. Do the majority have a right
to self determination, or should the politicians get the say?
For example direct democracy?
Or will that just produce the tyranny of the majority or the tyranny
of the stupid?
With "democracy" and its reduction to two party system (the
Liberal/Labour of Australia, or Democratic/Republican of America)
things are so corrupt, so despotic, that something has to change.
We have the people we have. And however we might "improve" things, we
have to start with who we are.

It's a random violence phobia, and my government having no strategy to
handle immigrants who might, or at least those who subsequently do
some random violent act. Random violence done by those born here is
another matter again.
I don't know that it's relevant, but my position goes way back - and
if it were truly relevant I could demonstrate that - but is it? What
is relevant or useful? Perhaps my ability to communicate my position

The assumption that "enough money will solve the problem" is generally false.
What is needed is a supra-tor or supra-"supplied by the govt/ isp"
physical network layer - or at least enough nodes in a 'slightly new
design' network which can use those nodes (assuming there are enough
of them, which might be large number, I have no idea).
That means individuals setting up their own links between them and
their neighbors. Neighbors is a loose concept - wireless links can hop
a fair distance.
The principle is:
- if you don't control it, if you did not physically set it up, it monitors you;
- if you don't install and 'control' the software running on the
hardware, it monitors you;
- if your hardware is backdoored before you receive it (e.g. built in
hidden other-than-wifi radio, keylogging cpu microcode, full hidden
net sniffing computer in your ethernet port), notwithstanding the
software you install on it, it monitors you.
There is so much room for necessary improvement that the situation is
depressingly grim.
TBB/Tor is at least something - just be sure you understand what it
is, and what it is not.
Good luck and surf safe,

More like, fatally flawed.
Here and there I wonder of possible constitutional clauses
(/amendments) which might somehow "balance" the degradation of the
state, whilst maintaining it's potential or claimed benefits:
 - eliminate politician salaries (or at least set them to a maximum of
the mean (not median) of government subsistence handouts (now -that-
might cause a rapid shift to "a living wage for everyone no
exceptions" :)
 - criminalise campaign donations (like HTTPS, raising the bar?)
 - do a Switzerland/ Israeli "every child must learn to competently
use a machine gun, and every household must possess at least one"
 - legalise at least all plants, probably all drugs
 - more?
So how does political anarchy improve on handling this 'problem', or
is it not a problem but a reality we must accept?
It is human nature to gather with or cooperate with those who hold
power, to the extent that it is in one's self interest - just as you
say above about those already holding power cooperating amongst
I don't think any particular political system can solve the problem of
the base nature of humans, although I do think some systems may have
better prospects for social stability over some period of time -
although more fundamentally is the state of consciousness of "we
humans" - and educating the next generation to strive for something
higher than the pursuit of greed.
Re education, I do recommend John Taylor Gatto - I read one book a few
years ago and promptly ordered a few more to read, he is that

Sounds like a prime beef you have with any constitution is its (lack
of) honesty. Perhaps we can work on that :)
I think you'd only see temporary 'improvement' and for a shorter time
than with constitutional statism.
Barring a general population wide increase in awareness/consciousness
of course - but the same can be said for any system.  I can keep my
mental door open to the possibility that political anarchism might
provide a longer duration of stability, or a greater likelihood for
"population awareness increase" but frankly I doubt that.
Of course we can argue that replacing one undemocratic mafia, e.g. the
British overlords that you guys kicked out, with another is
essentially "handling the problem of criminal cooperation inside a
government by getting rid of that government" as you say.
What are the metrics of national sanity?
- wealth levels?
- human intention towards family self sufficiency?
- stable military?
- deaths due to mafia faction fighting?
- actual freedoms which can be readily lived by individuals v.s.
proclaimed freedoms which have impenetrable and unspoken boundaries?
(speech, movement, association, growing food/plants, breeding, making
and doing anything which harms no one, choice v.s. imposition of any
medical procedure or substance, ...)
Why would political anarchy not descend into mafia coalitions, control
and actual anarchy, more quickly than constitutional statism?
Over here in Australia we have had pretty good run re 'political
stability', despite more and more total ratbags who now dominate -
yes, in military we've been lapdogs to USAgov in Vietnam, Iraq etc,
but internally we had say 80 years of prosperity and 'stability' - I
can imagine it having degraded more quickly if we had political
anarchism as our "foundation" rather than a "binding" constitution for
the mafia to target and having to spend effort to undermine.
Just like HTTPS - not actually providing its claims, just raising the
bar - does constitutional democracy also raise the bar?
Here we go - with constitutional statism, we need more truth in its
opening pages. How's this:
- we the people are, on the whole, sheep, willingly shorn for any 2
bit lie promise
- we are often greedy, self centered and small minded to an extreme
- we are by nature tribal, we live in fear, and we will sell our mates
for a dozen silver coins and our souls for a bowl of rice and the
promise of 'protection' from 'bad things'
- we are so pathetic, we will even continue to alternately vote in two
known political mafia gangs who persist in promising us everything
(housing, food, clothing, medical and 'protection') for nothing (just
a vote for them) whilst they continue to financially rape the country
through illegal and debt 'instruments'
- and so because we are so pathetic, we acknowledge that if we even
pretended to be able to live our own lives free of representatives and
a protectorate, we would very soon run screaming in fear to the
nearest gun-totin militaristic saviour
- in our well trodden and known to be doomed to total corruption
within at most a few decades, but ultimately placebo, if
self-deluding, concept of democracy, we seek to placate our own
madness and desire for an unachievable order in the world by declaring
another democratic religion for we, the sheeple, very soon to be shorn
of any and all of our achievements in this world by our new democratic
mafia overloards
How's that for an opener?
Certainly, we live in interesting times.
And then wrote so in clear and enjoyable to read true stories. Good stuff.

I.e. (I think is your question) "what's to stop cartels"?
OPEC, an international (unregulated) price fixing cartel gets created,
i.e. they turned themselves into middle men, consumers get shafted
since price gets maximised as a result.
"The market decides" - oil over $100/barrel, and shale oil became
profitable. The price did not come down, but we could also say shale
oil producers had yet to get going.
The Saudis (OPEC) halved the price of crude to target and eliminate
the US shale oil producers. This 'price war' is not yet over.
This has also been called a market share war with OPEC, Russia and USA
competing - the shale producers had caused USA to become an oil
exporting nation for the first time in yonks (official term for 'quite
a long time').
OPEC recently invited Russia to join (they've been 'observer' for
ages). Putin is holding onto his cards, not in any rush to make oil
price fixing decisions right at this particular moment in time.
This all looks like factional wars, rather than 'free' market.
And if the (rigged) price goes high enough, this will encourage new
and more efficient players.
Then the incumbent(s) band together to destroy the newcomer(s).
Regulation -against- monopoly incumbents is sometimes then 'enforced'.
I agree that the state is the primary creator of monopolies even if
the state sometimes handles the problem of monopolies.
Example state created monopolies:
- copyright
- trademarks
- patents
- licenses
- ripping up functional train and tram networks to help boost the car industry
Example types of licenses (you can't do this unless you're licensed,
only so many licenses are handed out, or the licenses are unduly
expensive thereby locking out small players):
- manufacturing
- operating
- usage
- service/repair
The question is, what's to stop OPEC like cartels in all industries?
Perhaps it doesn't matter - if bullies get too strong, the market for
assassins would presumably grow, to handle the bullies, and shit,
perhaps at some point we might even see humans being nice to each
Thanks to the Greeks and their dang black and white stones, we have
quite a long history of "democracy", and so most people might, just
might, be a little fearful of the unknown - in this case market

At the beginning of the U.S-led invasion of Afghanistan, the U.S.

Cross in Kabul. In an attempt to prevent such incidents in the future,
the U.S. conducted detailed discussions with the Red Cross about the
location of all of its installations in the country. Then the U.S.
bombed the same complex again. The second attack destroyed warehouses
containing tons of food and supplies for refugees. “Whoever is
responsible will have to come to Geneva for a formal explanation,”

clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem is a very serious incident. …

"There are $630 trillion in outstanding derivatives globally according
to the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) in Switzerland. That

I'm guessing that's the global position - so the USA govt, wall street

Futures are derivatives, and potentially very large debts (or gains).
This is the nature of leverage - a small outlay, a much larger return
or loss. Although the loss is not certain (of course), it is possible,
... that's the point ... when the gambles go the wrong way, for too
many people, then sometimes very large entities go belly up, as the
above article gives examples of. When this reaches a tipping point,
there is systemic collapse as we have seen historically. Then those
large entities ("too big to fail") can be "bailed out" by the tax
payer, or "bailed in" (the newest legislation here in Australia, and
possibly in US too) by simply grabbing some portion (up to 100%) of
all depositor's deposits.
If the big entity insurance (bail in or bail out) cannot compensate
adequately for the "debts", then the systemic collapse is a
depression/ full reset, rather than just a recession.
Whether one names derivatives as debt or not is immateriel - they
amplify shit when shit happens.
Well that's what we're looking for, something a little more definitive/ citable.

"September 10th, 2015: China’s Shanghai Gold Exchange announces that
physical gold bullion will be allowed to be used as collateral on
future’s contracts, beginning September 29th, 2015. “This development
is an important one for the gold market and is bullish for gold. It
shows, once again, that gold is slowly but surely becoming a cash
equivalent and as money again. Gold’s re-monetisation in the
international financial and monetary system continues.”
from here:
I may have posted the following a while back, not sure: Russia Reserve
Bank buys the majority (all?) of internal/Russia mined gold, most/all
of internal consumer gold is imported; the internal production is
roughly 20 tonnes a month, and I think Russia's reserves are around
1300 tonnes at this point. This is just the publicly official amount,
real amounts may be different.
China is stockpiling gold similarly rapidly.
It certainly goes hand in hand with their evident intention to jump
ship off the petro dollar, with BRICS, AIIB, SCO, EEU etc. And with
the US govt now 6 months bankrupt, without a further extension of
emergency funding measures and without an increase in the debt ceiling
we will see the full reset to some new "US reserve note/fiat" on or
shortly after October 30 (when the USGov next assesses their emergency
funding/ debt ceiling situation). Frankly, now that there is so much
selling of USGov securities:

We'll see in time. I have no doubt they (USG/Federal Reserve Bank) can

question is what is in their (maximal) interest - reset now, or QE
"Diversification" in the face of a soon to collapse world reserve

A sensationalist sounding piece about Deutsche Bank perhaps about to
fail, with numerical comparison to Enron and more:
"Glencore was originally said to have $30 billion of debt.  However,
that number did not include the $50 billion in bank credit lines
outstanding plus an undetermined amount of unsecured trade finance
deals.  The total exposure to Glencore debt by banks and investors is
now estimated to be as high as $100 billion – LINK.
To put this in perspective, Enron had $13 billion in debt at the time
of its collapse.  Moody’s continued to assign a triple-A debt rating
to Enron until shortly before it filed for bankruptcy.  I mention this
to illustrate the unreliability of “expert” hear-say analysis."

@_subject: a Cypherpunk not in our midst - "The End of Communism in Russia Meant 
This interview is from 1999, seems too long to copy and paste, and
there's no danger of it disappearing, so here's just a snippet:
"Q: All totalitarian systems had their own ideology. What is the
ideology of the new society you call post-democratic?
A: The most influential Western thinkers and politicians believe that
we have entered the post-ideological epoch. This is because by
“ideology” they mean communism, fascism, nazism, etc. In reality, the
ideology, the super-ideology of the Western world, developed over the
last fifty years is much stronger than communism or national
socialism. A western citizen is being brainwashed much more than a
soviet citizen ever was during the era of communist propaganda. In
ideology, the main thing is not the ideas, but rather the mechanisms
of their distribution. The might of the Western media, for example, is
incomparably greater than that of the propaganda mechanisms of the
Vatican when it was at the zenith of its power. And it is not only the
cinema, literature, philosophy - all the levers of influence and
mechanisms used in the promulgation of culture, in its broadest sense,
work in this direction. At the slightest impulse all who work in this
area respond with such consistency that it is hard not to think that
all orders come from a single source of power. It was enough to decide
to stigmatize General Karadžić or President Milošević or someone else
for the whole planetary propaganda machine to start working against
them. As a result, instead of condemning politicians and NATO generals
for violation of all existing laws, the vast majority of Western
citizens is convinced that the war against Serbia was necessary and
just. Western ideology combines and mixes ideas based on its needs.
One of these ideas is that Western values and lifestyle are the best
in the world! Although for most people on the planet these values have
disastrous consequences. Try to convince Americans that these values
will destroy Russia. You will not be able to. They will continue to
assert the thesis of universalism of Western values, therefore
following one of the fundamental principles of ideological dogmatism.
Theorists, politicians and media of the West are absolutely sure that
their system is the best. That is why they impose it around the world
without a doubt and with a clear conscience. Western man as the
carrier of these highest values is therefore a new superman. The term
itself is a taboo, but It all comes down to this. This phenomenon
should be studied scientifically. But I dare to say that it has become
extremely difficult to conduct scientific research in some areas of
sociology and history. The scientist who desires to research
mechanisms of democratic totalitarianism will face extreme
difficulties. He will be made into an outcast. On the other hand,
those whose research serves the dominant ideology are flooded with
grants while publishing houses and media are fighting for the right to
work with such authors. I have personally experienced it  when I have
been teaching and working as a researcher at foreign universities."

Well written. Spooner is now one for my must read list.
The apparatus of control is certainly impressive - a quarter of a
billion people living in fear, tyranny, living for others not for
himself, on the treadmill by consent just with a little stick prodding
of force and some shiny carrot things to ease the violation,
submission, subjugation of personal will.
Sounds like we're mostly dimmis, even without Islam the submission religion.

I say money is not something a sane person should want or not want,

I don't "want any money", but I do want to travel here and there and

golden treasure grass (hay).

I have to agree with Juan, and this is a 'fundamental' for me -
Fabianism, Gradualism, Fascism etc, from Stalin to Pol Pot to Syria's
al-Abad - and plenty of us Westernites, so "schooled" in "the greater
"coercion for the better is really not that bad" is just another way
to say "the ends justifies the means", or it's younger sibling "I was
just doing my job."
And this fundamental evil pervades most of the world today.
As Juan keeps reminding us over and over again.
"if we just coerce people a little, not too much now, for their own
interests, then things will get better"
"if we just kill enough bad people, we'll be left with mostly good
people, and the world will be a better place"
Whether a little, or a lot, coercion ends in the cult of the state
imposing death upon the people (that's us by the way). History shows
us this over and again. The recent blog post summary of the post-1944
escapades in Syria is a classic case in point.
Pol Pot revisited, "Nazi-style experiments" and all:
You can hear it:
" I know how to get to Utopia - just coerce a little, apply a little
force, restrain a few, torture but rarely, kill only when needed.  I
shall wield the force of coercion to get us there, to Utopia [I was
going to say "coercion in all its despotic forms" but all forms of
coercion -are- despotic so that would either be seen correctly as a
tautology, or incorrectly as a subset of the types of coercion].  Give
me the power to wield the force and I shall apply it to the
non-believers who would stop us from getting quickly to Utopia.  So,
quickly must we eradicate the forces opposing Utopia!  Do you believe?
 Only the superior believe.  Only the superior can make it to Utopia,
can be Utopia.  We must eradicate all the inferior.  Produce your
papers please! "
The road to hell IS paved with good intentions. The ends DO NOT
justify the means. Leave others, that is, everyone but yourself, leave
us the fuck alone!
Seems we are inexorably entering ... Juan's world.

I have the right to intimately engage your skull with a hammer,
because I can. That would be a predatorial right, sociopathic, mad,
evil etc (not to mention illegal in our Western democratic system),
-and- there's nothing in such an experience, i.e. exercise of said
predatorial right, which I would want; so, you can confidently trust
this would never happen :)
But not everyone thinks like me. You see, some people think like you.
Sort of: power suggests capacity, and capacity or ability implies a
natural right. A natural right, is that right which exists by your
natural capacity, or as you said "because I can".
I have natural rights to move, to communicate, to associate, to
breathe, to survive, to predate.
Some people really struggle with the reality of that last one. Yes, it
can be confronting. As a good friend of mine Malcolm says, the lion
has a predatorial right over the gazelle.
Now that's one fucked up statement. You are possibly referring to
"statutory" rights, or simply to domination "you pay me for
protection, and I shall let you continue to sell hot dogs."  The mafia
exercises many variations on the predatorial right to dominate others.
Our demoncratic governments school us to believe that government
exercise of power over us, i.e. dominating us, is in our "best
interest" - it is in your best interest to pay protection tax, to pay
mafia highway robbery road tolls (which go to banks, most often for
roads already paid for), to lose your "license" priviledge to drive/
travel/ survive (go to work) within your society.
Time to start typing less, with more thought put into each part of
each sentence, to produce a greater quality result. Perhaps brief up
on axiomatic logic.
Your heart is heard. Stay true to that which inspires you. Yes there
is much that is grave and wrong in the world today. Let's do the best
we can to understand our programming and so take a step towards
understanding and the possibility of exercising a worthy authority
arising within our hearts.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
The CEC perpetrates serious misunderstandings in this email, and
DANGEROUS proposed actions!
The CEC's otherwise un-challenged assumptions must be rebutted, and
hopefully understood.
Read on if you have time...
The only way to do that would be to have a referendum changing the
foundations of our federal constitution - this is a VERY DANGEROUS
thing to do!
Gerrit Schorel-Hlavka, Andrew Moyle, Malcolm McClure, Mark McMurtrie
and many others have shown that our CURRENT CONSTITUTION is plenty
enough for those individuals who know which bits are important and are
willing to stand in court (from personal experience, that's a bloody
hard thing to do).
We have powerful foundations in our federal constitution of Australia,
and any referendum at this point will almost certainly TAKE POWER AWAY
from the people, power THAT WE ALREADY HAVE if we would only use it.
The problem is that the people of Australia DO NOT KNOW the power they
hold thanks to our current constitution, and "change at any cost" will
result in a WORSE SITUATION for all of us (except temporarily for
those who currently hold political power, i.e. politicians, and they
should know better since in time new politicians will replace them).
She sits sort of above (in some very good ways mind you, at least with
respect to her duty to uphold Christian and other common law
foundations), but also in some ways she sits NEXT to our institutions
of power. And re Australia, she is more titular (sovereign in title)
than in the UK.
Absolute BOLLOCKS!
The tendency for those who don't know any better (such as myself 20
years ago at the first "make us a republic" referendum) is to:
1) Throw out the baby with the bathwater, so to speak.
2) Assume that a referendum will improve things - any change will be
better (yeah right!).
3) Assume that good people, who know how to improve things, are the
ones who write the proposed options or "referendum questions" at any
These assumptions are FALSE, and BLOODY DANGEROUS - since it is those
who currently have some political power, who want MORE power, and want
to get that additional power by TAKING it from we the people!
Is it you who writes the proposed new foundations to be put to
referendum? Is it me?
NO - it is not us, therefore why the hell should we think that what is
presented is going to be in our interest at all?
If the government REALLY wanted to improve things for us - that's
almost trivial to do - slash politician wages and pensions, eliminate
revenue raising by Police, stop making victimless crimes punishable
with jail, and plenty other common sense things, like don't bomb the
crap out of countries at the other side of the world of people who
think differently to us!  It's not that firetruckin difficult!
Bollocks! The Queen is essentially titular anyway! And:
A) She (the "Crown") granted us our respectful and united request for
nationhood, with her blessing!
B) The naming of our titular sovereign in our federal constitution's
Preamble "under the Crown" is an AWESOME thing - this invokes the
PROTECTIONS of the crown - Bill of Rights 1688, The Great Charter, ie.
the Magna Carta 1215 and 1297. USE THESE AND REJOICE!
C) Besides our foundational BILL OF RIGHTS and the great MAGNA CARTA,
many other IMPERIAL ACTS are at our disposal - some of these are
awesome! Right to Trial by Jury? check! Right to be brought before the
Supreme Court and not be held indefinitely "on remand"? Writ of
Mandamus, check!!
D) Besides these and more wonderful things, the Crown is bound, and
similarly we have bound ourselves, in our federal constitution, to the
Blessing of Almighty God!
This Blessing is better than the rest of the protections of the Crown
combined - to learn why this is true is an excellent journey in
understanding, and highly recommended!
"So why are things so bad?" I hear you ask ... well, there are a bunch
of power-hungry, greedy, selfish, self-centered humans who lust for
positions in parliament, and so 'we' leave it to them since most of us
want to get on with a life, family, creativity, wealth and stability.
"Leaving it to them" is a major problem with we Aussies!
Also most "of us Aussies" do not know the awesome foundations in our
federal constitution - The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act
1900/1901/whatever - tear it down AT YOUR PERIL, fellow Australians!!!
The Crown has a duty of care to the people, and that duty of care HAS
BEEN MET in the VERY FOUNDATIONS of our federal constitution!
Learn these foundations and enjoy the fruits!
We ought be thankful to the Crown, for providing to every one of us
Australians such an awesome foundation! It was hard won for sure -
some tough negotiating back and forth between our Aussie delegates
(our founding fathers), and the Crown, and the British Parliament -
but we got there, we got our nation and we kept the protections of the
Crown, and we got the protections of the Blessing of Almighty God.
Just because we might have a bunch of crooks who've taken power in our
parliament today, does not mean we have a fundamentally broken system!
We have a fundamentally good system, with some bad (selfish and
compromised) people! As Malcolm has said many times - better to have
bad people in a good system, than good people in a bad system - the
bad system will deteriorate MUCH QUICKER! Our current constitutional
monarchy system has withstood over 100 years of internal attacks and
Warning, this is what those in power want. Every few years they try
again to turn us into a republic!
So what should we want?
The Crown HAS satisfied its duty of care to the people - this might
sound strange, but in fact it is true. What is also true is that our
state (i.e. our state and federal parliaments) have a duty of care to
us as well - and on this front there are many failures.
Finally and MOST IMPORTANTLY, it is also true that WE, the people,
have a duty of care to our state (i.e. our state and federal, and also
local for that matter, parliaments) - we the people have THOROUGHLY
FAILED in our duty of care to our own state/ our system of government,
our constitutional monarchy and the protection of our federal
Absorb that, and know why we have problems. No matter what "system" we
have, if we, the people, fail to satisfy our duty of care to our own
bloody state, then we deserve the problems we get and no constitution
in the world will ever do it for us!
Sure, blame the government, blame the Crown and blame our constitution
- but in the case of us here in Australia, blaming anything outside of
ourselves won't help a bit, and a new constitution will not only NOT
solve the problem, it almost certainly will create a WORSE PROBLEM,
and the protections of the Crown, and the Blessing of Almighty God,
are protections we should NEVER GIVE UP.
NOTE CAREFULLY - even the SMALLEST CHANGE to the Preamble of our
federal constitution, will allow the LAWYERS and POLITICIANS and
JUDGES to reinterpret all the rest of our constitution, name us a
republic and/ or a secular state and remove the protections of the
BLESSING OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
Let me repeat, whether you are religious or not, never give up the
protections of the Blessing of Almighty God, as invoked by our
founding fathers in our federal constitution. Give up these
protections at your peril.
And corrupt Australian politicians play lap dog to USA and Britain
(/the Queen/ whatever)!
Just as the president of the USA is commander-in-chief of the combined
military forces of the USA.
Just as there is some possibly analogous situation in Australia which
no-one knows for sure but if we read our constitution we'd probably
find out about.
British parliament. And perhaps via the governor general, the
parliament of Australia. I don't know the details here. But do note,
when (if) we the people finally learn to express our will of the
people, for example oh that's right, establishing our nationhood as
states federating in a commonwealth under the Crown and by the
Blessing of Almighty God, then the Queen/Crown has been known to
assent to said will of the people.
But bloody hell mate, we have to speak up. And we need to speak in
relative unity.
If we can't unite in any demand of our politicians, for example to
slash politician wages, how the hell do we think we'll ever get a
better deal at a referendum scripted and orchestrated by those same
politicians? Dream on...
That sounds specific to UK, but whatever.
Certainly here in Australia we sign to treaties by our own
parliament's sovereign right and authority.
The Chameleon Crown - ok, haven't heard that one before.  That can
also be described as "historically significantly neutered Crown".  A
rose is a rose...
Historically, "benevolent dictatorships" are also one of the most
stable forms of societal structure - yes it requires ongoing
benevolence of the monarch/dictator though, of course, yet exactly the
same thing must be said of our "democratic" parliament - our
Australian federal parliament is pretty non-benevolent these days,
with incredibly feathered nests, declarations of war around the world,
pervasive spying on its own population, and an endless litany of
enforced victimless crimes...
Oh right, America/ USA is a wonderful example of democracy today!
No.  Firetrucking.  Way.
I didn't realise the CEC had sold out common sense.
Watch out people - the road to hell is paved with good intentions,
like diluting our local tribe with an endless parade of
sympathy-snatching refugees from illegal wars perpetrated by our own
government no less.
I hope we Aussies can wake up. I really really hope so.

Hi Jim, a good question indeed. At Germany's 6% Islamic population set
to grow to 12% in the next few years, there is going to be quite the
shift there in the next couple of years.
Some questions which Germans might ask themselves:
1) Do ethnic Germans, who are citizens of Germany have:
 - the right to racial strength, and or
 - the right to cultural strength, and or
 - the right to political strength, and or
 - the right to religious strength,
in their own country (Germany)?
2) Is it racist for ethnic Germans of Germany to want to maintain
their political majority in Germany?
3) We note that Islamic Muslims strongly practice and proclaim their
rights to racial strength, cultural strength, religious strength, and
political strength, and more than this, the right to change/ convert
any and all non-Muslim jurisidictions (countries or part thereof) to
Sharia Law and Muslim religion. So:
- Are German citizens so naive to think that Muslims will change, just
because they crossed a "border"?

What does that matter to the essence of the question?
The fundamental question is the same, whatever words we use. A rose is
a rose by any other name.
Perhaps we could ask "currently franchised (those who may vote)
Germans" - the point is, do those who are presently gathered in a
current physical 'locality' have the right to protect their current
racial/ genetic/ demographic/ cultural/ political/ religious "mix",
whatever it is, against dilution from immigration, asylum,
"democratic" coup (e.g. Ukraine today) or religious missionaries of
any faith?
The opium wars in China suggest that trying to infiltrate ones
religion into a 'foreign' nation may not be altogether appreciated by
the locals - and Islamic Muslims are pretty vehement about this too
from what I hear - why shouldn't predominantly Christian (or
atheistic, or ...) nations be similarly intolerant to a diluting
influx of those of different think?
Well yes, about a day after the email starting this thread, I sent a
similar one modified appropriately for Australians as an on-topic
reply to another email about Australia's increase in "Syrian refugees"
now also to occur here - but I figured for the purposes of this list
that one version of essentially the same email was probably enough :)
So do we citizens of [pick your nation] have the right to protect the
status quo within our nation, to protect it against dilution from
immigration or asylum, or must we allow the attractions that our
nation presents to would be immigrants (whatever arises in their mind
in this regard) to be enough of a test for immigration/ asylum?
I.e., do the current locals of
Germany/Australia/Hungary/Italy/Greece/Conch Replubic, have a "valid
right" to object to their politicians "throwing the doors wide open",
as Austria and Germany have recently done?

Sad indeed. A nuanced (from our western media perspective), almost

what those problems were:
I add that today, the relevant thing is that Putin on an inter-nation
level is one of the only true diplomats on today's world stage, and
has forged many significant relationships (e.g. BRICS) which have
shifted power significantly and irrevocably away from USA and towards

by those in power, and not by those who are directly affected by the
decision makers (the people themselves). Is keeping such decisions in
the hands of a few "educated elected" an elitist approach?
If democracy be the will of the people manifested, then ought the
people of any nation be asked directly (nation wide vote) on such
questions as cultural dilution due to immigration and or asylum?
Or is it appropriate for an "elected" few to impose their personal
preference on a nation?

Or simply seeking the insights of your now asked two questions as
above and struggling (perhaps ironically) to come to such insights by
myself - no underhanded or disingenuous intention need be ascribed.
The thoughtful part of your reply is really appreciated. Thank you for
your patience going forward.
I consider the first ground to be that of individual/ collective
right. Even getting beyond this first ground is a challenge for many -
you're the first person in my (humble, inadequate, deficient...)
attempts over the last year or two, who actually got past "do we have
the right".
Your next two questions are not easy. I have no immediate answer. A
temporary brain dump of things which may arise and perhaps ought be
contemplated to arrive at any sane answer to your last two questions:
- reciprocal legislation on a per-country basis - if we can't build
churches in your country, you can't build mosques in ours; if we can't
buy property in yours, you can't buy in ours
- "tipping points" for 'cultural crisis' due to immigration by
refugees or otherwise
- Christians being executed in various countries today
- the Christian crusades of 100s years ago
- are we humans beyond barbarians to any real extent
- what about those of us in golden middle-class cages, are we
barbarians in disguise
- to what extent is it our "western" governments (and or military
industrial companies) causing the turmoil/ wars from which the genuine
refugees flee from
- should we citizens suffer the fallout from the evil activities of
our governments and military industrial companies bombing brown people
and or poor people - is it possible to stop our governments/ companies
from doing so
- is maintenance of local/ per-country cultural homogeneity worth
pursuing at all, or is that somehow fundamentally at odds with the
majority of humans on the planet being "below the poverty line" and
therefore with their "right to a share" of my (relatively) wealthy
middle class existence (even for example for those on government
assistance/ welfare)
I feel as though we are being sold out by our western governments
driven by the military industrial companies, and that we are being
caused to suffer the consequences of this. And I feel powerless to
stop this evil, to stop the (unlawful, but hey) killing of people on
an industrial scale. I feel that there is so much profit from war,
that there is intention to war and for war, and that this is out of
control. Courtesy the internet we know this turmoil has been
perpetrated continuously since WWII by USAGov (CIA) and its "allies",
lackies, lapdogs - coup after coup, regime change after regime change.
There's so much that's not ok by me and I struggle to find clear and
simple foundations which can approach shared consensus understanding
and agreement on what is wrong, let alone how if at all possible to
fix it.
Thanks for suffering my totally inadequate and rambling attempts at
something resembling communication, but I am sincere in my desire for
a better world - for everyone in it.

"Judge Finds German Woman Guilty of Raping Eight Pakistani Muslim Men
April 22, 2013
"In the City of Wassenberg in Western Germany a woman has been found
guilty of seducing and raping eight men in the first case of its kind
in Europe. Maria Heidelsohn aged 18 alleges that on the afternoon of
August 23rd she was pulled away by eight men from the porch she was
sun bathing on and carried into a small shed in which she was brutally
and repeatedly gang raped. Heidelsohn alleges that she cried for help
repeatedly until she was bound and gagged, she then claims that she
was beaten severely and both of her arms and one leg were broken.
Wassenbeg Police Chief Abdullah Al Hussein contends that there is no
evidence Heidelsohn did not injure herself or ask a friend to injure
her in order to attempt to frame up her alleged attackers. The Police
Chief noted that no male adult Muslim men saw the attack occur to
corroborate her story despite the area being largely Muslim. In the
large German town new legislation passed overwhelmingly last year
stipulates that four adult male Muslim witnesses are necessary in
order to corroborate any charges made by a woman in accordance with
traditional Islamic jurisprudence. "
Sep 9th, 2015
"A little 7 year old girl was brutally raped by a Muslim migrant from
North Africa.
The girl was with her mother in the park in Chemnitz, Germany, when a
Muslim man dragged her into the bush, held her mouth shut and brutally
raped the little girl.
After he finished the rape, he let the girl go and left the crime
scene running. It happened quick that the mother did not even notice
anything. She first realized it when the seven year old girl came
crying to her."
"This is exactly what the media doesn’t want you to know – but they
are completely ignoring it. Let’s make it heard everywhere."
"Schools in Germany order girls to cover up to avoid being attacked by
Muslim refugees
  September 9, 2015
In yet another startling fact about the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis
that the liberal media is completely ignoring, school officials in
Germany are warning teenage girls to avoid wearing certain attire for
fear of offending Muslim refugees."
"Not so very many years ago, Oslo was virtually a rape-free city,
inhabited by people who had been brought up on civilized notions of
mutual respect and tolerance. No longer. Over the years, the incidence
of rape has risen steadily. A wildly disproportionate number of the
perpetrators are "rejected asylum seekers” – which may sound puzzling
unless you are aware of the perverse state of affairs whereby even
persons officially rejected for asylum in Norway are still allowed to
stay. And the increasing temerity of the rapists – who know very well
that they will probably not be caught, and, if caught, will not be
severely punished – is reflected in the fact that the most recent rape
(in which two men assaulted a 21-year-old woman) took place virtually
in the backyard of the Royal Palace."
"The total Muslim population in Sweden is estimated at 4.4% (2013
figures). Out of that 4.4% and in deducting the women and children, we
can roughly guesstimate that around 2% are male. The foreign rape
figures at 77.6% Muslim has been anonymously confirmed by Swedish
polish in a phone conversation. The actual figure could be higher.
These percentages do not include Muslims with Swedish citizenship
contained within rapes in the figures categorized under “Swedish
"According to a new study from the Crime Prevention Council, Brå, it
is four times more likely that a known rapist is born abroad, compared
to persons born in Sweden. Resident aliens from Algeria, Libya,
Morocco and Tunisia dominate the group of rape suspects. According to
these statistics, almost half of all perpetrators are immigrants. In
Norway and Denmark, we know that non-Western immigrants, which
frequently means Muslims, are grossly overrepresented on rape
statistics. In Oslo, Norway, immigrants were involved in two out of
three rape charges in 2001. The numbers in Denmark were the same, and
even higher in the city of Copenhagen with three out of four rape
charges. Sweden has a larger immigrant, including Muslim, population
than any other country in northern Europe."

"Sweden: Rape Capital of the West"
"Forty years after the Swedish parliament unanimously decided to

violent crime has increased by 300% and rapes by 1,472%. Sweden is now
number two on the list of rape countries, surpassed only by Lesotho in
Southern Africa."

Schools in Germany are ordering teenage girls not to wear mini-skirts

References: Hi Jim, I remember suggesting this to M about 5 or 6 years ago. I have
not looked into the economics of it (i.e. how Australia's national
budget could make it work) and so it was heartwarming, or at least
very interesting to me, to read the article you forwarded which had a
few (small) examples in the last century where this has been trialed -
and that in at least one example, inflation went down, not up, quite
contrary to "normal economist" expectations!
Very, very interesting. What this tells us, is that "the abundance
community" (or rather nation), can indeed work - and with robotics and
automation being spearheaded heavily this year by Japan we may well
need such a new economic model for nations in general. The fact that
it has been shown it works in at least a couple examples, is generally
great news of course.
I experience in the "free software"/"libre computing" community -
Debian GNU/Linux, RedHat/Fedora and more, and from me-as-programmer
experience, it is a world of abundance - hackers (the good ones - i.e.
those who do stuff to benefit the community) essentially have an
abundance of the raw material or tools of trade - i.e. all you need is
a computer and away you go, you can write whatever program you think
people might enjoy using - since electricity to run your computer is
close to free - add a few solar cells and it is free.
So in truth all the "information worker" needs to manifest their
creativity (besides their computer) is food and shelter - same for
musicians and certain other creative artists etc.
And since the marginal cost (incremental cost) of duplicating a
(digital) song, or computer program, is very close to zero dollars
(just download it for a tiny bit of electricity expense), then when I
give my computer program to society as free/libre software, I am
causing an exponential benefit to society, since as many people as
have computers, can benefit from my creation.
This is an "abundance economy" in action, and although I don't get
wealth in this situation where I give my computer program away, I get
credos/ ego satisfaction, recognition, esteem from my peers and or the
users of my program, and potentially a job doing something I really
enjoy (supporting users who benefit financially from my program, who
are willing to pay for some support, training, and or enhancements to
my computer program - this will normally just be the companies that
use my program - but RedHat demonstrates that it's possible to build a
billion-dollar company just supporting free software which is pretty
As long as I can do a bit of travel, have food in my belly and a warm
couple of rooms to live in, I'm basically content and happy with life,
since it is my nature to be creative (with computers) and to give away

A prescient argument you have, it seems - perhaps those initial

since it is after all, very important that the Germans protect against
offending the refugee and immigrant cultural rights.
At least the Greek police are on the job checking the humanitarian aid

Here's the full (20min, 60MB interview) youtube link from the bottom
of the article below, which is kind of needed since then you can hear
the full interview (the questioner and the other side):
USAGov/CIA lies - back then (August 2013) as we see in this interview
team USA was saying 'We don't want regime change - we just want a
limited (100 frigate-based missiles) strike against key Syria targets
to send a message that chemical warfare is not ok', whilst:
a) the leaked emails from a few days before the interview already
showed that it was not Assad government, but 'terrorist' chemical
warfare actions (not Assad govt) which also were a false flag done by
CIA, and
b) today we see team USA saying 'Assad must go, regime change is
required to protect human rights'
So team USA says what it wants, when it wants, in order to fuel more
war, which in turn funds Lockheed, Raytheon etc. See here:
"The business of war is profitable. In 2011, the 100 largest
contractors sold $410 billion in arms and military services. Just 10
of those companies sold over $208 billion...
These companies have benefited tremendously from the growth in
military spending in the U.S., ... in 2000 $312 billion ... 2011 $712
billion ...
 Lockheed Martin notched $36.3 billion in sales in 2011
Them missiles are expensive, highly profitable.

Rogue States and Diplomacy: a Conversation With Noam Chomsky
The interview is quite long, focusing on the USA Republican reaction
to the Iran sanction-lifting deal, amongst other things. Noam seems to
be a Professor, so I guess his arguments might be too intellectual for
the unwashed masses. Here is one question and answer:
Professor Chomsky, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Samantha Power,
has said that the problem is the “instability that Iran fuels beyond
its nuclear programme”. She echoed U.S. Defence Secretary Ashton
Carter, who went to Israel’s northern border and said, “We will
continue to help Israel counter Iran’s malign influence” by supporting
Hizbollah. The U.S., he intimated, reserved the right to use military
force against Iran. Could you comment on this?
NC: Power’s usage is standard: she defines “stabilisation” according
to a peculiar logic. For instance, U.S. policy in Iraq is defined as
stabilisation. What does that stabilisation look like? The U.S.
invades a country, with hundreds of thousands killed and millions
becoming refugees, along with barbarous torture and destruction that
Iraqis compare to the Mongol invasions, leaving Iraq the unhappiest
country in the world according to WIN/Gallup polls. It also ignited
sectarian conflict that is tearing the region to shreds and laying the
basis for the ISIS [Islamic State of Iraq and Syria] monstrosity along
with its Saudi ally. That is stabilisation. The standard usage
sometimes reaches levels that are almost surreal, as when liberal
commentator James Chace, former editor of Foreign Affairs, explains
that the U.S. sought to “destabilise a freely elected Marxist
government in Chile” because “we were determined to seek stability”
[under the Pinochet dictatorship].
Let us consider the case of Hizbollah and Hamas. Both emerged in
resistance to U.S.-backed Israeli violence and aggression, which
vastly exceeds anything attributed to these organisations. Whatever
one thinks about them, or other beneficiaries of Iranian support, Iran
hardly ranks high in support for terror worldwide, even within the
Muslim world. Among Islamic states, Saudi Arabia is far in the lead as
a sponsor of Islamic terror, not only by direct funding by wealthy
Saudis and others in the Gulf but even more by the missionary zeal
with which the Saudis promulgate their extremist Wahhabi-Salafi
version of Islam through Quranic schools, mosques, clerics, and other
means available to a religious dictatorship with enormous oil wealth.
The ISIS is an extremist offshoot of Saudi religious extremism and its
fanning of jehadi flames.
In generation of Islamic terror, however, nothing can compare with the
U.S. “war on terror”, which has helped to spread the plague from a
small tribal area in Afghanistan-Pakistan to a vast region from West
Africa to South-East Asia. The invasion of Iraq alone escalated terror
attacks by a factor of seven in the first year, well beyond even what
had been predicted by intelligence agencies. Drone warfare against
marginalised and oppressed tribal societies also elicits demands for
revenge, as ample evidence indicates.
The two Iranian clients [Hizbollah and Hamas] also share the crime of
winning the popular vote in the only free elections held in the Arab
world. Hizbollah is guilty of the even more heinous crime of
compelling Israel to withdraw from its occupation of southern Lebanon
in violation of [U.N.] Security Council orders dating back decades, an
illegal regime of terror punctuated with episodes of extreme violence,
murder and destruction.
Iran’s “fuelling instability” is particularly dramatic in Iraq, where,
among other crimes, it alone came at once to the aid of Kurds
defending themselves from the ISIS invasion and it is building a $2.5
billion power plant to try to bring electrical power back to the level
before the U.S. invasion.

Iraq: Chaos! Libya: Chaos! Syria: Chaos! Whatever NATO touches, turns
putrid, rots and dies. Three interventions by the Anglo-Saxon Alliance
(UK and US), two by the FUKUS Axis (add France), three interventions
by NATO, three destabilized States crawling with terrorists. The

and the onus is on them to right the wrongs they willfully committed.
You messed up, now... Pay for it!
Are dogs Vegans? Do you feed goldfish chocolate? Common sense says no
in both cases. Common sense also dictates that you do not intervene in
highly complex societies with thousands of years of tradition and lore
intricately mixed up in a myriad of ethnic and religious mosaics
cemented together by a Governing body that understands where the point
of equilibrium is to be found and which is kept in its position by the
players in the society which it governs.

A company of the Portuguese Army was detailed to build a new village
for a community in the interior of Angola during the Colonial War*.
The company had been instructed to do so because the village had been
devastated. The architect based his idea on the downtown area of the
capital city of Portugal, Lisbon, reconstructed in straight parallel
lines after the earthquake and ensuing tsunami in 1755, which
destroyed the city. The community was transported to the village and
proudly shown their new home by the Portuguese captain. They ran away.
Asked why they didn't like their village, the community leader, or
soba, explained: "Our village is based on the circle. We eat sitting
in a circle, our homes are circular, we sit outside in a circle in the
evenings telling stories, laughing and singing. We take decisions
sitting in a circle, it has no head, no beginning and no end. And no
dark corners."
Can women in Saudi Arabia use forks when they eat? No, because it is
considered improper for a woman to put four long and hard prongs in
her mouth at the same time because when a man sees this, it gives him
unclean thoughts. For those western policy-makers chortling in mirth
as they read this, let us now come back to the point of this article,
the failed Western policy in Iraq, in Libya and in Syria.
Iraq: chaos! Libya: chaos! Syria: chaos! In all three cases, Western
politicians outdid one another in sheer arrogance, claiming (so
democratically) that "Saddam must go", "Gaddafy must go," and "Assad
must go". What we see in these three countries today is the direct
result of the criminal intervention by NATO, its two henchmen, the USA
and its poodle in chief, the UK and recently, France, which spends its
time subserviently crawling around the legs of its Anglo-Saxon NATO
masters across the Channel and across the Ocean, when it isn't
obediently obeying Germany's calls for austerity.
NATO destroyed Iraq, destroyed the State, destroyed the mechanisms of
control in a highly complex society whose many ethnic and religious
groups co-existed in peace until the West stepped in, after provoking
Iraq by getting Kuwait to steal oil in cross-drilling operations, then
demonizing the Iraqi Government, then directly interfering in the
internal affairs of a sovereign State by getting the Shiites in the
South to rebel, before the uprising was crushed. This criminally
irresponsible approach to foreign policy-making seems to be endemic in
the corridors of Whitehall, London and Washington DC, one of
Whitehall's most fetid and dysfunctional abortions over the years.
There ensued a decade of terrorist activity in Iraq between the First
and Second Gulf Wars, in which NATO aircraft strafed fields of cereals
and left the country strewn with Depleted Uranium, causing the deaths
and malformations of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children, before
the outrage in 2003 when the Government was overthrown in an illegal
military invasion which resulted in around one million deaths
(murders) and today, the total destabilization of the State by ISIL, a
wonderful feather in the cap for Washington and its poodle in chief.
Yesterday they were full of bravado as they marched across the border
knowing Saddam Hussein (who was keeping al-Qaeda out of Iraq) had no
Weapons of Mass Destruction (his mistake was not to arm himself to the
hilt) and knowing the Iraqi Armed Forces would not fight back (in the
event the invasion was staged, with salvoes being fired over the
Iraqi's heads as they retreated to negotiated positions). Today
Washington and London are quivering in fear and are too scared to
fight ISIL, the monster they created.
This same criminal irresponsibility was demonstrated in Libya, where
they again intervened, this time joined by that sickening wannabe
Napoleon, France, this time not only creating but actively using
terrorists on their own lists of proscribed groups, which Muammar
al-Gaddafy (the first international leader to issue arrest warrants
against al-Qaeda) was fighting. Again, military equipment was deployed
against civilian structures, civilians were slaughtered by NATO
aircraft, the Libyan water supply system was targeted (war crime), the
electricity grid was destroyed (war crime) and the result, once again,
was the wholesale destruction of a State. Under the Geneva
Conventions, any military intervention must leave the area invaded
functioning properly attending to the needs of its citizens.
In not managing to guarantee this, the USA and its poodles in Europe
have failed miserably in their task and have shirked their
responsibilities. They are also responsible for criminal acts
breaching every fiber of international law. Their leaders are, in
plain English, war criminals and murderers.
And now for Syria. Just a few months ago that Nobel Peace Prizewinner
Obama in the USA was saying that Assad had to go, obediently parroted
by Cameron and Mr. 17 per cent popularity ratings, Hollande. Now, they
are considering sending military support to fight off ISIL in Syria,
after these very same Western/NATO powers armed, trained and aided
terrorists to fight the Government of President Assad, which has wide
approval across Syrian society.
If it was not so serious, it would be hilarious. But destroying
countries and societies has shocking social implications. What these
NATO countries deserve is for their boomerang to come back and smack
them square in the face, facing their own jihadis, to get a taste of
their own medicine, except for the fact that logic dictates that one
cannot attack their approach abroad and then wish the same thing on
them at home. What these criminally irresponsible powers must do is
man up, accept the responsibility for what they have done, and pay to
sort out the problems they created, keeping their unwanted troops at
As those in Whitehall and Washington (let's be honest, Paris really
doesn't count, does it?) claim that we live in difficult times and
attack those who disagree with their criminal modus operandi, they
should be reminded that the evils they face are those of their own
creation. Instead of arrogantly ploughing ahead like modern-day
imperialists, they would do better to respect international law for
once, accept the responsibility for their actions, mind their own

For those who have been involved in the political and military
processes in Iraq, Libya and Syria, they belong behind bars. The
mechanisms are already in place, the wheel is turning slowly, and most
of them will live long enough to cast looks of fear over their
shoulders wherever they may go. Blair already does, Rumsfeld dare not
step off an aircraft outside the USA, ditto Powell, Bush, Cheney and
Condoleezza Rice. The head of NATO is evil, psychopathic; the hand of
NATO is putrid, sociopathic and the finger of NATO is as icy as it is
satanic and demonic. It is the finger of death, contaminating
everything it touches.
NATO is the incarnation of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse:
Conquest, War, Famine and Death. It is the Empire of Evil.

former colonies Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, from 1961 to
1974; there was no war in Portugal's other African provinces, Cape
Verde and São Tomé and Principe Isles.

Indeed it could be seen as retaliation - an enticing if impossible to
prove proposition - Germany's leader finally suggests alternative
approaches required to handle Syrian refugees 'and Assad' and the

now the shift:
* Sep 1, 2015 - EU migrant crisis: Germany's Angela Merkel suggests
border controls may be re-introduced
* 04 Sep 2015 - Germany helps Russia bypass Ukraine via ‘Nord Stream 2’
(who needs the EU energy protectionist package when you can go direct to Russia)
* Sep 12, 2015 - Germany's Merkel sees need to cooperate with Russia on Syria
* 24.09.2015 - Merkel says Assad must have role in Syria talks
and possible reprisal by US - 'VW scandal!' (7 years late) and new US
nukes stationed in Germany (take THAT, Germans!):
* Sep 18 - VW Is Said to Cheat on Diesel Emissions; U.S. to Order Big Recall
* September 21, 2015 - U.S. Will Station New Nuclear Weapons in
Germany Against Russia

@_subject: NATO, the finger of death 
References: Well it looks like Russia learnt 'the way' of NATO in Libya (and
Afganistan, Iraq, Egypt ... and most other CIA-led coup
'opportunities') - that is to destabilise then followed by cross
fingers. And in Syria, it seems Russia has decided that Russia's
relationships and interests are going to be protected (like Russia's
leased naval base). So at this point, I don't think it matters much
what USG in the guise of NATO want or 'should' do.
I think this is the primary question - the world was split up (roughly
speaking) in oil terms, after WWII, and now USA is saying they want to
resplit the world - as in, control more than what they have for so
long. Personally I'm very happy with the arrangements with Russia, but
on the other hand I'm not a European oligarch, so what would I know?
As it so happens, I'm also not an American oligarch (oil or banks),
but as a very humbly living Australian looking on, I breathe a sigh of
relief that Russia is finally asserting itself - putting its global
foot down and saying enough's enough. As I've said clearly in the
past, the CIA's (and USGov's) actions in the world, for decades, and
the consequences and fallout from those actions, is not f!@ ok!
And so I would rephrase your question like this: Should we consent by
acquiescence (by doing nothing) to our collective "western"
"demoncratic" governments spearheading coup after coup in foreign
countries - with a quarter million civilians dead in Syria already,
let alone Lybia, Iraq, Afganistan etc?
In dignity, a human's first position must always be "is mass killing
ok" and never "is the current balance of trade equation ok".
Well now that Russia (with now China and...) is supporting the current
democratically elected government in Syria, let's see if the outcome
is less of a mess than the CIA's last 30 attempts...
Perhaps the regime in America needs a change towards democracy.
Sadly, whilst fear and acquiescence rule the majority, they sheeple
will continue to acquiesce in fear, and therefore be shorn. Political
anarchist 'state' requires at least a threshold % of people who are
not in fear, or who at least are willing to live in self sufficiency,
in 'true' freedom, and in 'faith' that we can handle rogue individuals
and rogue factions who here and there will attempt to dominate others
individually and or collectively.
I would dearly love to see the day where humans can truly be worthy of
typical 'founding fathers' claims and statements.

@_subject: Fwd: EPA opposed DMCA exemptions that could have revealed Volkswagen 
References: Not new but on topic at the moment - DMCA is about control of end
consumers/ users, not about copyright (or rather, it's abuse of
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Dear Mr Harkness,
We have written previously about the [organizations and
individuals][1] who opposed exemptions to the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act's (DMCA) anti-circumvention provisions. These drones
oppose the rights of users to backup, modify, and study the software
and devices that we own. The DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions
create legal penalties for simply accessing your software under your
own terms, and raises those penalties even higher should dare to share
the tools needed to do so. It creates real penalties for anyone who
wants to avoid Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) controls. The
granting of exemptions to these totalitarian rules is a broken and
half-hearted attempt to limit the damage these rules bring, granting
for 3 years a
reprieve for certain specified devices and software.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) side-stepped this process
and [sent a letter][2] separately directly to the Copyright Office. In
the letter they argued that users should not be able to access and
modify the software on their own vehicles. In their estimation, this
would enable users to violate emissions controls. So it would be
better for them if the hammer of the DMCA remained hanging over the
head of every user or researcher who wanted to access the software on
their vehicle.
Of course, just a few months after telling the Copyright Office that
users couldn't be trusted with access to their devices, the EPA
revealed a major scandal involving Volkswagen. It turns out that
Volkswagen had for many years cheated the emissions test performed by
the EPA. Volkswagen had surreptitiously included some code in their
diesel vehicles that would detect the EPA's tests and have the car
change its performance in order to meet EPA mandates. Once the test
was over, the code would revert the vehicle to its normal,
high-polluting functioning. This scam apparently went on for years
before it was detected by researchers.
Of course the irony is that if users and researchers had the right to
access the software on their cars, they might have discovered this
fraud years ago. As Eben Moglen, founder of the [Software Freedom Law
Center][3] [noted][4] "If Volkswagen knew that every customer who buys
a vehicle would have a right to read the source code of all the
software in the vehicle, they would never even consider the cheat,
because the certainty of getting caught would terrify them.”
Volkswagen is already a contributor on the kernel Linux, and as
Bradley M. Kuhn, President and Distinguished Technologist of the
[Software Freedom Conservancy][5] pointed out it is likely that
Volkswagen vehicles already contain some free software. But some is
not all, and
clearly they kept much of their software secret in order to hide their
scam. If all the software on the vehicles was free software they never
could have perpetrated this scheme.
Researchers also could have discovered the fraud had they not been
hindered by the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions, as Kit Walsh of
the Electronic Frontier Foundation [argued][6]. The EPA of course
failed to understand all this when drafting their letter promoting the
use of DRM.
But there is a more galling fact at play here. What the EPA argued in
their letter was that the exemption should not be granted under the
DMCA as a means for enforcing efficiency standards. That clearly isn't
the stated purpose of the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions, and
highlights one of the fundamental problems with DRM. That a government
agency would try to commandeer the DRM of private actors, not to
enforce copyright but as a means to enforce something wholly
unrelated, demonstrates a central truth: DRM is not about copyright;
it's about control. It's about dominating users. It's about spying on
them. It's about installing [rootkits][7] onto their computers. It has
nothing to do with rights, and everything to do with restriction.
We can't let governments and corporation use DRM to take over our
lives. This is what you can do today to fight back:
If you microblog, please share the following message (or your own)
with the hashtag  We strongly suggest that if you use
[Twitter][8] to publicly call the EPA  and Volkswagen out, you do it
in a way that avoids using proprietary software:
*  You should be ashamed of yourself for trying to use Digital
Restrictions Management  *   All software on your vehicles needs to be free software without
DRM to restore our trust  Here's what else you can do.:
* Join the [Defective By Design][9] mailing list to keep up to date on
the on-going fight against DRM.
* To help fund our work, consider [donating to the FSF][10].

"Oklahoma Video Vigilante Uses Drone To Wage War Against Prostitutes and Johns
Chris Baraniuk writes at BBC that Brian Bates, known in Oklahoma as
the "Video Vigilante," is taking credit for Amanda Zolicoffer's
conviction on a lewdness charge after being caught on Bates' drone
mounted camera in a sex act in a parked vehicle last year. Zolicoffer
was sentenced to a year in state prison for the misdemeanor while the
case against her alleged client, who was released following arrest in
December, is still pending. "I'm sort of known in the Oklahoma City
area," says Bates . "For the last 20 years I've used a video camera to
document street-level and forced prostitution, and human trafficking."
Bates runs a website where he publishes videos of alleged sex workers
and their clients. "I am openly referred to as a video vigilante, I
don't really shy away from that," says Bates adding that the two
individuals were inside a vehicle and the incident occurred away from
other members of the public. The drone dropped to within a few feet of
the vehicle where it filmed a 75 year old in the front seat of the

I Know Why Poor Whites Chant Trump, Trump, Trump
Apr 1, 2016By Jonna Ivin
BW_man	
have relied on the loyalty of poor whites. All Americans deserve
  I’m just a poor white trash motherfucker. No one cares about me.
I met the man who said those words while working as a bartender in the
Ozark Mountains of northwest Arkansas. It was a one-street town in
Benton County. It had a beauty parlor, a gas station, and a bar where
locals came on Friday nights to shoot the shit over cheap drinks and
country music. I arrived in Arkansas by way of another little town in
Louisiana, where all but a few local businesses had boarded up when
Walmart moved in. In Arkansas, I was struggling to survive. I served
drinks in the middle of the afternoon to people described as America’s
“white underclass (
 )”
— in other words, people just like me.
Across the highway from the bar was the trailer park where I lived. I
bought my trailer for $1000, and it looked just like you would imagine
a trailer that cost $1000 would look. There was a big hole in the
ceiling, and parts of the floor were starting to crumble under my
feet. It leaned to one side, and the faint odor of death hung around
the bathroom. No doubt a squirrel or a rat had died in the walls. I
told myself that once the flesh was gone, dissolved into the
nothingness, the smell would go away, but it never did. Maybe that’s
what vermin ghosts smell like.
I loved that trailer. Sitting in a ratty brown La-Z-Boy, I would look
around my tin can and image all the ways I could paint the walls in
shades of possibility. I loved it for the simple reason that it was
the first and only home I have ever owned.
My trailer was parked in the middle of Walmart country, which is also
home to J.B. Hunt Transportation, Glad Manufacturing, and Tyson
Chicken. There is a whole lot of money in that pocket of Arkansas, but
the grand wealth casts an oppressive shadow over a region entrenched
in poverty. Executive mansions line the lakefronts and golf courses.
On the other side of Country Club Road, trailer parks are tucked back
in the woods. The haves and have-nots rarely share the same view, with
one exception: politics. Benton County has been among the most
historically conservative counties in Arkansas. The last Democratic
president Benton County voted for was Harry S. Truman, in 1948.
There is an unavoidable question about places like Benton County, a
question many liberals have tried to answer for years now: Why do poor
whites vote along the same party lines as their wealthy neighbors
across the road? Isn’t that against their best interests?
Ask a Republican, and they’ll probably say conservatives are united by
shared positions on moral issues: family values, religious freedom,
the right to life, the sanctity of marriage, and, of course, guns.
Ask a Democrat the same question, and they might mention white
privilege, but they’re more likely to describe conservatives as
racist, sexist, homophobic gun nuts who believe Christianity should be
the national religion.
But what if those easy answers are two sides of the same political
coin, a coin that keeps getting hurled back and forth between the two
parties without ever shedding light on the real, more complicated
  I’m just a poor white trash motherfucker. No one
  cares about me.
What if he’s right?
• • •
People want to be heard. They want to believe their voices matter. A
January 2016 survey by the Rand Corporation reported that Republican
primary voters are 86.5 percent more likely to favor Donald Trump if
they “somewhat agree” or “strongly agree” with the statement, “People
like me don’t have any say about what the government does.”
What is it about a flamboyant millionaire that appeals to poor white
conservatives? Why do they believe a Trump presidency would amplify
their voices? The answer may lie in America’s historical relationship
between the wealthiest class and the army of poor whites who have
loyally supported them.
wealthy elites have relied on the allegiance of the white underclass
to retain their affluence and political power. To understand this
dynamic, to see through the eyes of poor and working class whites as
they chant, “Trump, Trump, Trump,” let’s look back at a few unsavory
slices of America’s capitalist pie.
Until the first African slaves were brought to Jamestown, Virginia, in
1619, wealthy plantation owners relied on indentured servants for
cheap labor. These white servants were mostly poor Europeans who
traded their freedom for passage to the American colonies. They were
given room and board, and, after four to seven years of grueling
servitude, freedom.
About 40 percent lived long enough to see the end of their contract.
Colonial law provided “freedom dues,” which usually included 100 acres
of land, a small sum of money, and a new suit of clothes. Yet some
freed servants didn’t know what was due them, and they were swindled
out of their land grants. With no resources and nowhere to go, many
walked to regions where land could still be homesteaded, and settled
in remote areas such as the Appalachian Mountains.
As the British labor market improved in the 1680s, the idea of
indentured servitude lost its appeal to many would-be immigrants.
Increasing demand for indentured servants, many of whom were skilled
laborers, soon bumped up against a dwindling supply, and the cost of
white indentured servants rose sharply. Plantation owners kept skilled
white servants, of course, often making them plantation managers and
supervisors of slaves. This introduced the first racial divide between
skilled and unskilled workers.
Still, African slaves were cheaper, and the supply was plentiful.
Seeing an opportunity to realize a higher return on investment, elite
colonial landowners began to favor African slaves over white
indentured servants, and shifted their business models accordingly.
They trained slaves to take over the skilled jobs of white servants.
An investment in African slaves also ensured a cost-effective,
long-term workforce. Female slaves were often raped by their white
owners or forced to breed with male slaves, and children born into
slavery remained slaves for life. In contrast, white female servants
who became pregnant were often punished with extended contracts,
because a pregnancy meant months of lost work time. From a business
perspective, a white baby was a liability, but African children were
permanent assets.
As the number of African slaves grew, landowners realized they had a
problem on their hands. Slave owners saw white servants living,
working, socializing, and even having babies with African slaves.
Sometimes they tried to escape together. What’s more, freed white
servants who received land as part of their freedom dues had begun to
complain about its poor quality. This created a potentially explosive
situation for landowners, as oppressed workers quickly outnumbered the
upper classes. What was to prevent freed whites, indentured servants,
and African slaves from joining forces against the tyranny of their
As Edmund S. Morgan says in his book American Slavery, American
Freedom, “The answer to the problem, obvious if unspoken and only
gradually recognized, was racism, to separate dangerous free whites
from dangerous slave blacks by a screen of racial contempt.”
Many slave owners in both the North and South were also political
leaders. Soon, they began to pass laws that stipulated different
treatment of white indentured servants, newly freed white men, and
African slaves. No white indentured servant could be beaten while
naked, but an African slave could. Any free white man could whip a
Black slave, and most important, poor whites could “police” Black
slaves. These new laws gave poor whites another elevation in status
over their Black peers. It was a slow but effective process, and with
the passing of a few generations, any bond that indentured servants
shared with African slaves was permanently severed.
As slavery expanded in the South and indentured servitude declined,
the wealthy elite offered poor whites the earliest version of the
American Dream: if they worked hard enough, they could achieve
prosperity, success, and upward social mobility — if not for
themselves, then perhaps for future generations.
But few realized that dream. In “The Whiting of Euro-Americans: A
Divide and Conquer Strategy,” the Rev. Dr. Thandeka notes:
  "Not surprisingly, however, poor whites never became the economic
equals of the elite. Though both groups’ economic status rose, the gap
between the wealthy and poor widened as a result of slave
productivity. Thus, poor whites’ belief that they now shared status
and dignity with their social betters was largely illusory."
With whites and Blacks divided, the wealthy elite prospered enormously
for the next two hundred years while poor whites remained locked in
poverty. With the potential election of Abraham Lincoln, however, the
upper class began to worry they would lose their most valuable
commodity: slave labor. The numbers were not on their side — not the
financial numbers, but the number of bodies it would take to wage war
should Lincoln try to abolish slavery. And it was white male bodies
they needed. (Poor women were of little value to the rich, since they
couldn’t vote or fight in a war.) So how did wealthy plantation owners
convince poor white males to fight for a “peculiar institution” that
did not benefit them?
Religious and political leaders began using a combination of fear,
sex, and God to paint a chilling picture of freed angry Black men
ravaging the South. Rev. Richard Furman stated,
  "… every Negro in South Carolina and every other Southern state will
be his own master; nay, more than that, will be the equal of every one
of you. If you are tame enough to submit, abolition preachers will be
at hand to consummate the marriage of your daughters to black
Another warning from Georgia Commissioner Henry Benning to the
Virginia legislature predicted,
  "War will break out everywhere like hidden fire from the earth. We
will be overpowered and our men will be compelled to wander like
vagabonds all over the earth, and as for our women, the horrors of
their state we cannot contemplate in imagination. We will be
completely exterminated and the land will be left in the possession of
the blacks, and then it will go back to a wilderness and become
another Africa or Saint Domingo."
Wealthy plantation owners had succeeded in separating the two races,
and they now planted a fear of Blacks in the minds of poor and working
white men. Enslaved Blacks were an asset to the wealthy, but freed
Blacks were portrayed as a danger to all. By creating this common
enemy among rich and poor alike, the wealthy elite sent a clear
message: fight with us against abolitionists and you will remain safe.
It worked. Poor and working class whites signed up by the hundreds of
thousands to fight for what they believed was their way of life.
Meanwhile, many of the wealthy planters who benefitted economically
from slavery were granted exemptions from military service and avoided
the horrors of battle. On both sides of the Mason-Dixon line, wealthy
elites were allowed to pay other men to take their place on the bloody
battlefields. As the war lingered on, poor whites in the North and
South began to realize the rich had waged the war, but it was the poor
who were dying in it.
I’m just a poor white trash motherfucker. No one cares about me.
With more than 650,000 deaths, the end of the Civil War eventually
brought freedom for African-Americans. But after the war, ex-slaves
were left to linger and die in a world created by those in the North
who no longer cared and those in the South who now resented their
existence. Poor whites didn’t fare much better. Without land,
property, or hope for economic gains, many freed Blacks and returning
white soldiers turned to sharecropping and found themselves once again
working side by side, dependent on wealthy landowners.
• • •
During the Reconstruction Era, the press continued to spread “black
men raping white women” propaganda. Again, this was intended to
prevent poor whites and poor Blacks from joining forces. As Ida B.
Wells wrote in her 1892 pamphlet, Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All
Its Phases:
  "The editorial in question was prompted by the many inhuman and
fiendish lynchings of Afro-Americans which have recently taken place
and was meant as a warning. Eight lynched in one week and five of them
charged with rape! The thinking public will not easily believe freedom
and education more brutalizing than slavery, and the world knows that
the crime of rape was unknown during four years of civil war when the
white women of the South were at the mercy of the race which is all at
once charged with being a bestial one."
This fear and mistrust continued for decades, not just in the South,
but throughout all of America. From the factories of industrialized
cities in the North to rural farmlands in the Midwest, from the Statue
of Liberty in the East to the filmmakers in the West, racism had
replaced classism as the most blatant form of oppression. But classism
lingered, despite what wealthy elites would have Americans believe.
Martin Luther King Jr. saw the enduring oppression of both poor whites
and Blacks. In December 1967, King and the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC) began organizing the Poor People’s
Campaign of 1968. According to Rev. Dr. Ralph Abernathy, the
campaign’s goal was to “dramatize the plight of America’s poor of all
races and make very clear that they are sick and tired of waiting for
a better life.”
King alluded to that goal when he spoke about wealth inequality in
“The Drum Major Instinct” on February 4, 1968. In his sermon, he
talked about a conversation with his white jailers, saying:
  "And then we got down one day to the point — that was the second or
third day — to talk about where they lived, and how much they were
earning. And when those brothers told me what they were earning, I
said, “Now, you know what? You ought to be marching with us. You’re
just as poor as Negroes.” And I said, “You are put in the position of
supporting your oppressor, because, through prejudice and blindness,
you fail to see that the same forces that oppress Negroes in American
society oppress poor white people. And all you are living on is the
satisfaction of your skin being white, and the drum major instinct of
thinking that you are somebody big because you are white. And you’re
so poor you can’t send your children to school. You ought to be out
here marching with every one of us every time we have a march.”
  "Now that’s a fact. That the poor white has been put into this
position, where through blindness and prejudice, he is forced to
support his oppressors. And the only thing he has going for him is the
false feeling that he’s superior because his skin is white — and can’t
hardly eat and make his ends meet week in and week out."

When King was assassinated just a month later on April 4, the SCLC and
King’s widow, Coretta Scott, decided to go ahead with the campaign. On
Mother’s Day, May 12, thousands of women formed the ﬁrst wave of
demonstrators, led by Coretta Scott King and joined by Ethel Kennedy,
wife of presidential candidate Sen. Robert Kennedy. Protestors built a
temporary encampment on the Mall in Washington, D.C., and 3,000
participants occupied “Resurrection City” for over a month. In June,
50,000 demonstrators joined them for the Solidarity Day Rally for
Jobs, Peace, and Freedom. SCLC leaders and the National Welfare Rights
Organization lobbied Congress to introduce an “economic bill of
rights” for all Americans.

Robert Kennedy, a key advocate for the campaign, was assassinated on
June 6, 1968, a month into the campaign. His funeral procession passed
through Resurrection City. Discouraged by the murders of King and
Kennedy, scarce media coverage, and horrible living conditions in the
camp, demonstrators’ optimism waned. Their land use permit expired on
June 24, and Resurrection City closed. When the Poor People’s Campaign
ended, so ended King’s vision of turning the nation’s attention to
eradicating poverty among all people, and guaranteeing all people the
opportunity for meaningful jobs with livable wages.
The minimum wage for a tipped position in Arkansas — like the one I
held as a bartender — is $2.63 an hour. The assumption is that tipped
workers will earn their own minimum wages by making up the difference
in tips. When this happens, a “tip credit” is given to employers, and
they save money by paying less than the standard minimum wage.
It was the way I spoke that landed me the job. I had no experience,
but the owner of the bar told a friend she hired me because, “she
speaks well and has all her own teeth.” I guess she assumed I would
learn to make drinks. I didn’t. I wasn’t very good at my job, but one
thing I was good at was listening. And what I often heard was a
growing dissatisfaction among poor whites who were struggling to make
ends meet in the failing economy.
I understood their fear and frustration. I’ve spent a great deal of my
life living in poverty. It’s scary being poor, worrying that one
parking ticket would mean I couldn’t buy groceries, or deciding
whether I should see a dentist about a toothache or pay my trailer
park fee. It’s humiliating and terrifying, but sitting around and
crying about it isn’t an option because we know that the only thing
more pathetic than someone living in poverty is someone living in
poverty and crying about it. How many times have we been told to get a
job, or that if we just worked harder we could improve our situation?
Work harder. Work harder. Work harder. American society has made it
perfectly clear: if you are poor, it’s your own damn fault.
I understood what it was to go hungry. Many times I didn’t eat on my
days off, but waited until I could get back to work and sneak
something from the kitchen. Remember that tip credit? I did, too,
every time I stole a biscuit with gravy or a basket of tater tots.
I understood their anger. Since crying isn’t an option, we swallow the
sadness, and it sits and churns and gets spit back out as anger. I’ve
felt this anger more times than I care to remember. I was angry that I
couldn’t afford to paint my walls in shades of possibility. I was
angry at my life choices that never felt like real choices. I was
angry that wealth and prosperity were all around me while my hands
remained clenched in empty pockets.
What I couldn’t understand was why my customers directed their anger
at other poor people.
“I applied for a job at Tyson Chicken. They only hire Mexicans because
they work cheap. We need to get those people out if we want jobs.”
I heard this over and over from unemployed men at the bar. So why
weren’t they angry with Tyson Foods, a company that could easily
afford to pay higher wages? Why weren’t they angry with CEO-turned
Chairman John Tyson, whose personal net worth is over a billion
The answer I always got was that John’s father, Donald “Don” J. Tyson,
the college drop-out who built his own father’s chicken farm into a
multi-billion-dollar company, was a good ol’ boy. He wasn’t
highfalutin like the city slickers of California and New York. Tyson,
they felt, was one of them, a working class man who’d bootstrapped his
way into the top one percent. He wore a khaki uniform with his name
embroidered over the pocket, spoke with an “aw shucks” southern twang
and was often quoted as saying, “I’m just a chicken farmer.”

 Donald J. Tyson
Don Tyson wasn’t just a chicken farmer, much like the plantation
owners weren’t just cotton growers. He was a multi-billionaire running
a global corporation. Didn’t they know that in 1997, Tyson Foods pled
guilty and paid $6 million in fines and costs for making gifts to Mike
Espy, then President Bill Clinton’s secretary of agriculture? Didn’t
they know that, from 1988 to 1990, Bill Clinton gave Tyson Foods $7.8
million in tax breaks while turning a blind eye to 300 miles of rivers
polluted from chicken waste? Maybe they didn’t know those things, but
what they did know was that poor Mexicans were taking their jobs.
Over the years, Tyson Foods has settled numerous lawsuits, paying
millions of dollars for infractions ranging from water pollution, race
discrimination, and sex discrimination, as well as a $32 million wage
settlement case.
“The Mexican guys just hire other Mexicans. You can’t even work there
if you don’t speak Spanish.”
Were they right? I would say yes.
In December 2001, a federal grand jury indicted Tyson Foods and six
managers on 36 counts related to conspiring to import undocumented
workers into the U.S., and employing them at fifteen chicken
processing plants throughout the country. One defendant shot himself a
few months after the indictment. Two made plea agreements and
testified for the government. They said they were doing what the
company demanded when they went along with the hiring of illegal
workers. The remaining three executives claimed the others were
“rogue” employees, and denied any knowledge of wrongdoing; they were
The grand jury alleged that the conspiracy began in 1994, when Tyson
executive Gerald Lankford mentioned production at a Tennessee facility
and said, “That plant needs more Mexicans.”
There was no question that Tyson illegally smuggled undocumented
workers into the U.S. The trial was about who initiated the operation.
Regardless of who knew what, at least three managers at Tyson saw that
brown workers were cheaper than white workers, and adjusted their
business model accordingly.

It makes perfect sense that Don Tyson would say, “My theory about
politics is that if they will just leave me alone, we’ll do just
fine.” What didn’t make sense to me was that poor and working class
locals would agree with him.
Don Tyson, having lived his entire life in northwest Arkansas, was one
of them. I wasn’t. I was born and raised in California. Sure, my
people were blue-collar rednecks and my mother often reminded me that
we were one generation removed from poor white trash, but I wasn’t
Southern and I didn’t speak their language. My speech pattern wasn’t
formed by higher education or a silver spoon in my mouth; it was
simply a matter of accent. But it is an accent associated with liberal
snobs. I was an outsider.
Don Tyson didn’t make poor people in town feel inferior, but outsiders
did. I’m not surprised, considering how socially acceptable it has
become to mock poor whites, especially those born and raised in the
South. Instead of fighting for better education for the white
underclass, we call them ignorant rednecks. Instead of fighting for
them to have better health care, we laugh at their missing teeth.
Instead of fighting for them to have better housing, we joke about
tornados hitting trailer parks.
Luckily, life often has a way of turning stereotypes on their heads,
if we pay attention.
 “It has become socially acceptable to mock poor whites born and
raised in the South.”
I was working my day shift at the bar, the same regulars sitting on
the same barstools. Three men I’d never seen came in and sat at a
table on the patio. They looked like most everyone else in the area,
blue-collar scruffy types. I figured they were on a lunch break or
they were in town to fish on the lake. I took their order, brought
their food, and when they finished eating, dropped off the check. When
they came up to the register to pay, one of the men made a comment
about my hat. I didn’t catch what he said but his friends smirked.
I said, “Excuse me?”
My hat was a black and white newsboy cap. It covered my head on days I
didn’t feel like doing my hair. But to the man, it meant something
else, something I didn’t understand.
He said, “I guess you like ‘em black.”
I said, “My hat?”
I was confused and I felt tension in the air. The bar had gone quiet.
One of my regulars was sitting near the register, and he asked the man
if he was from a particular town, one I hadn’t heard of. When the man
nodded, my regular said, “Well, we don’t roll like that around here.”
I handed the man his change. He glanced around at the regulars staring
at him. It felt like a stand-off in an old western movie. Was a brawl
about to break out over my hat? The man shook his head, looked at me
in disgust, and walked out with his friends. The tension left with
I asked, “What the hell was that all about?”
“They’re Klan,” my customer said. I must have looked shocked. He said,
“Don’t worry. We got your back.”
A few months later, I left Arkansas and moved to Vancouver,
Washington. Across the river in Portland, they call it “Vantucky.” I
always dreaded driving into Portland with my big F150 truck sporting
Arkansas plates. I imagined the liberal urbanites seeing me as one of
“those people,” as if they expected me to barrel down the street
chucking Walmart bags full of trash out the open window while blasting
“Sweet Home Alabama” on my way to shoot up an abortion clinic. This
was all in my head, but in a city known for its liberalism, I once
again felt I didn’t belong.
I signed up for training to be a court appointed special advocate
(CASA) for kids in foster care, and attended a series of classes in
Vancouver. One night, the instructors gathered the forty or so
trainees for an exercise. We stood in a room and the leader of the
group read a list of statements. Without speaking, we were to cross to
the other side if the statement applied to us or stay in our place if
it didn’t. As the exercise went on, I started to notice a pattern.
“I’ve been affected by a family member’s drug or alcohol problem.” I
crossed the room with a third of the volunteers.
“I’ve been affected by poverty.” I crossed the room with a tiny
fraction of volunteers.
“I’ve graduated with a degree in higher education.” I stayed in my
place as all but one woman crossed to the other side. The woman stood
next to me and held my arm, and I immediately sized her up: older,
well-dressed, probably married right out of high school. Privileged.
It was an exercise in non-judgment — and it was humiliating. Not a
single person looked at us. Their eyes focused on the floor, their
hands, or something incredibly interesting on the ceiling. I suppose
it was the polite, non-judgmental thing to do. If something or someone
makes us uncomfortable, we simply avert our eyes and create an
invisible barrier. You stay over there. I’ll stay over here.
Those two experiences helped me see more clearly than ever how
fool-headed it is to stereotype people based on how they look and
where they live. The “redneck hillbillies” in that Arkansas bar could
have laughed with the three Klan members, or said nothing at all.
Instead, they stood up for me — an outsider — and made it known that
the Klan wasn’t welcome there. On the other hand, I assumed a group of
liberal, college-educated volunteers would ooze warmth and solidarity.
But in class that night, I didn’t feel especially welcome. And I felt
ashamed for judging that woman’s life based entirely on her
I’m just a poor white trash motherfucker. No one cares about me.
What would America look like today if King had succeeded in uniting
poor people of all races? Would my bar customers in Arkansas more
easily identify with Blacks, Hispanics, and other people of color than
with billionaires like Don Tyson? Would they feel as if their voices
mattered, as if they had some say in what their government does?
Martin Luther King Jr. was concerned about poverty, and he also saw
the growing inequality between the richest Americans and the poor and
working classes. By the 1960s, this inequality was on the rise, but
would soon become much more pronounced.
In 1976 — just eight years after King’s call for unity among all poor
people — Ronald Reagan launched his second unsuccessful bid for the
Republican presidential nomination. In his campaign, he repeatedly
trotted out the now infamous “Welfare Queen” story.
Reagan got the GOP nod in 1980, and during his presidential campaign,
he portrayed himself as a grandfatherly, all-American cowboy, a true
Washington outsider. He promised to fix the economy with a combination
of tax breaks, reduced government regulation, and cuts to federal
Reagan’s economic plan, dubbed “Reaganomics,” provided tax cuts that
primarily benefitted the rich. The intent was to encourage the upper
classes to spend and invest more, which would boost the economy and
create new jobs. His disdain for welfare hadn’t changed. To offset tax
cuts and massive increases in military spending, Reagan slashed
federal social programs — for low-income Americans.
Neither Reagan nor Congress was willing to touch Social Security,
Medicare, or Medicaid; they were too popular among the middle class.
This left a tiny portion of the federal budget for social programs on
the chopping block, including food stamps, vocational education, and
subsidized housing, among others. From fiscal year 1980 to fiscal year
1987, federal funding for these programs plummeted by 35.6 percent.
After a two-year recession, the economy rebounded and continued to
grow. Yet while the Reagan administration congratulated themselves on
the economic expansion, poor people were still struggling. But Reagan
had given poor whites someone to blame for their suffering: the
Welfare Queen. He never said she was Black. He didn’t have to.
Lee Atwater was an adviser to both Reagan and President George H. W.
Bush, and chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1989
until his death two years later. In 1981, while working in Reagan’s
White House, Atwater gave an interview to Alexander Lamis, a political
scientist at Case Western Reserve University. In an unguarded moment
that Atwater believed was off the record, he said:
  "You start out in 1954 by saying, “Nigger, nigger, nigger.” By 1968
you can’t say “nigger” — that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff
like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and
you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes,
and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things
and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.… “We
want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing,
uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “Nigger, nigger.” "
In five short sentences, Atwater explained how Republican politicians
could appeal to poor whites’ racism (conscious or unconscious) without
using blatantly racist language. This shift was important because
Reagan had cut social programs that began with the presidencies of
John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.
 “Republican politicians appealed to poor whites’ racism without using
blatantly racist language.”
In 1963, President John Kennedy had begun planning a “war on poverty”
intended to help poor, southern whites — particularly in Appalachia
and the rural South. Kennedy had visited Appalachia during the 1960
presidential campaign, and was shocked by what he saw — ”the hungry
children, … the old people who cannot pay their doctors bills, the
families forced to give up their farms.” Many of these families were
descendants of white indentured servants who had fled to the
Appalachian Mountains. The poverty Kennedy saw was, in part, a legacy
of the era of slavery.
President Johnson, a greater ally to Black civil rights leaders than
Kennedy had been, took over the program after Kennedy’s assassination
and expanded its scope. These programs ultimately helped poor Blacks
and poor whites, in both urban and rural areas.
In 1987, Reagan quipped, “In the 60s we waged a war on poverty, and
poverty won.” That was pretty glib for a President who had just
slashed social services by almost 36 percent. What was to keep poor
whites from seeing they had lost just as much as poor Blacks?
The groundwork had already been laid. It wasn’t Reagan’s fault that
social programs had to be cut. The “welfare queens” made him do it.
Poor whites were still poorer, but at least they weren’t criminals,
and that distinction was critical in their minds.
“It’s one of those persistent symbols that come up every election
cycle,” says Kaaryn Gustafson, author of Cheating Welfare: Public
Assistance and the Criminalization of Poverty. “This image of the lazy
African-American woman who refuses to get a job and keeps having kids
is pretty enduring. It’s always been a good way to distract the public
from any meaningful conversations about poverty and inequality.”
Gustafson’s inclusion of inequality is important, because inequalities
in both income and wealth distribution would soon begin a steep climb.
The reality of Reaganomics was that Americans who gained the most were
the nation’s richest ten percent. During periods of economic
expansion, the bottom 90 percent saw a decline in income gains. By
2012, those gains had been replaced by losses.

In hindsight, it makes perfect sense that President Reagan would share
Don Tyson’s desire for smaller government. In 1986, Reagan said, “The
most terrifying words in the English language are: I’m from the
government and I’m here to help.” What doesn’t make sense is that
America’s white underclass would agree with him.
Public assistance programs are easy targets for politicians, thanks in
part to the racial divide introduced by slave owners in colonial
America. Politicians, the corporate media, and giant employers (like
Tyson) have continued to drive socioeconomic wedges between poor
whites and poor minorities. Working class whites may view economic
struggles as temporary setbacks, and see their use of social services
as a last resort. But politicians keep implying that for minorities,
public assistance is a way of life.
Many social programs — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Women, Infants
and Children (WIC) — provide benefits that cannot be abused. Yet the
message to the white underclass was clear: your tax dollars are being
squandered on undeserving people looking for a free ride.
I can’t speak to how much assistance people with children or
disabilities receive, but I can tell you what I received as a single,
childless adult with no assets and a zero balance in my checking
account. I qualified for less than $200 a month through the SNAP food
stamp program. That’s it. I wasn’t living large off the man. I wasn’t
kicking back playing video games on a big screen TV. I was struggling
to survive until I could find work.
I didn’t have the luxury of feeling shame or embarrassment about using
food stamps, but I didn’t prance into the grocery store waving my card
around, either. At the checkout line, I shielded my card, and myself,
from the people around me. I thought, “Fuck you and your judgment.”
When I eventually found a job, I no longer qualified for assistance,
and I remained poor. My story is common and unremarkable, unlike the
fictional tale of welfare recipients driving luxury cars and eating
lobster every night.

When terrorists attacked the U.S. on September 11, 2001, Americans
pulled together. They displayed a unity reminiscent of the weeks
following the bombing of Pearl Harbor. President George. W. Bush
declared, “America is united.”
Ultimately, there would be two versions of unity: one for the rich and
one for the poor.
The Carlyle Group was named after the luxury hotel where founding
members first met in 1987 to discuss the creation of a multinational
private equity corporation. In 2001, employees and advisors of the
firm included former U.S. President George H. W. Bush; Bush’s former
Secretary of State James Baker; former Secretary of Defense Frank C.
Carlucci; and former British Prime Minister John Major.
Under the guidance of this powerful lineup of Washington insiders and
international leaders, the Carlyle Group soon became known for buying
businesses related to the defense industry — and tripling their value
during wartime. In 2002, they received $677 million in government
contracts. By 2003, as the war effort shifted focus from Afghanistan
to Iraq in search of weapon of mass destruction, the defense contracts
leapt to $2.1 billion.
The Carlyle Group wasn’t the only corporation that would profit from
the wars. From 2003 to 2013, KBR — a subsidiary of Halliburton, once
run by Dick Cheney — was awarded $39.5 billion in government
contracts. Other war profiteers include Agility ($7.4 billion),
DynCorp ($4.1 billion), and Blackwater ($1.3 billion). By early 2013,
private defense contractors had collectively earned more than $138
A 2006 report by the Institute for Policy Studies found that, in 2005,
CEOs of the largest U.S. private defense contractors continued to
profit from the ongoing wars.
Defense CEO pay was 44 times that of a military general with 20 years
of experience and 308 times that of an Army private in 2005. Generals
made $174,452 and Army privates made $25,085, while average defense
CEO pay was $7.7 million.
In contrast to wealthy individuals who became even wealthier, those
who were sent to do the actual fighting comprised disproportionately
high numbers of working class Americans. In the combined efforts of
Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom,
almost 7,000 U.S. soldiers have died. More than 970,000 veteran
disability claims have been registered with the Veterans
Returning soldiers face higher unemployment rates than their civilian
counterparts, particularly among male veterans age 21 to 24. Between
2009 and 2012, the youngest veterans had an unemployment rate of 21.6
percent, compared to 13.5 percent for civilians.
Veterans struggle to find proper healthcare in a system ill-prepared
for the number of wounded, particularly those with catastrophic
injuries and mental health issues that require long-term care. Private
nonprofit organizations have been picking up the slack left by
inadequate funding in the federal budget.
 “Army privates made $25,085, while average defense CEO pay was $7.7 million.”
Like their ancestors who fought in and survived the Civil War, today’s
soldiers return to find their situations either the same, or much
worse, than when they left. Who would blame them for being angry? As
soldiers go off to war we say, “God bless our troops.” Maybe we should
add, “God help them when they come home.”
“My entire life, I’ve watched politicians bragging about how poor they
are, how they came from nothing, how poor their parents and
grandparents were. And I said to myself, if they can stay so poor for
so many generations, maybe this isn’t the kind of person we want to be
electing to higher office. How smart can they be? They’re morons.”
— Donald Trump, New York Times, 1999, “Liberties; Trump Shrugged”
Donald Trump sells himself as a scrappy, self-made man whose vision,
tenacity, and business savvy alone have made him one of the world’s
most famous billionaires, but Trump is not self-made by any measure. A
poster boy for generations of socioeconomic privilege, Trump joined
the New York Military Academy at age thirteen, then studied at Fordham
University before transferring to the Wharton School of the University
of Pennsylvania. During the Vietnam War, Trump was granted five draft
deferments — the first four for education, and the last for medical
In 1968, he joined his father’s real estate business, then
conservatively valued at $40 million. Donald took over The Trump
Organization in 1974 and restyled the company in his image — a special
blend of ego, flamboyance, and rabid ambition. He steered clear of the
steerage class and catered exclusively to the rich by buying or
building luxury residential properties, office buildings, hotels,
casinos, golf courses, and resorts.
Capital from his father’s company wasn’t Trump’s only empire-building
head start. He depended on both government and private assistance,
too, including tax abatements, financial support from the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), investors, and, during the company’s
1990 massive financial troubles, a bailout pact involving seventy
In his 2000 book, The America We Deserve, Trump criticized
governmental interference in American business. He wrote, “The
greatest threat to the American Dream is the idea that dreamers need
close government scrutiny and control. Job one for us is to make sure
the public sector does a limited job, and no more.”
Trump didn’t seem threatened by the public sector’s involvement in his
four corporate bankruptcies. Trump told Forbes in April 2011,
“Basically I’ve used the laws of the country to my advantage and to
other people’s advantage … just as many, many others on top of the
business world have.”
In his eyes, Trump is a self-made entrepreneur who refuses to
acknowledge the millions of dollars of family, public, and private
assistance that helped him realize his gilt, mirrored glass, and pink
marble American dream. Government regulations that stifle ambition are
a threat to American dreamers everywhere, but laws that can be used to
the advantage of top-of-the-business-world warriors are just fine.
It makes perfect sense that Trump would share Ronald Reagan’s and Don
Tyson’s desire for smaller government. What doesn’t make sense is that
America’s white underclass would agree with him.
Big or small, our government has failed everyone but the wealthiest
class. Most politicians barely maintain a pretense of representing the
people — except during election years when they talk about “issues”
and make promises they have no intention of keeping. Once in office,
they become puppets of the richest ten percent of Americans. If you
think I’m exaggerating, watch this video:
 Donald Trump is a business man. Until recently, money and fame were
everything to him. He measured his success by his ranking in the
Forbes 400 list of billionaires. Now, Trump wants power and control,
too. Like wealthy plantation owners who just happened to be
politicians, Trump does not need to be bought; he is already rich
enough. From a business perspective, he’s trying to cut out the middle
man — the politicians who have become puppets of the wealthy elite.
I’m just a poor white trash motherfucker. No one cares about me.
What if some people did care, but the wealthy pushed them away?

Marginalized people have been fighting for equality for decades.
Admittedly, in the quest to fight for the oppressed — people of color,
women, religious minorities, the LGBTQ community — we often overlook
the fact that classism never completely disappeared. For the white
underclass, it’s tempting to feel left out of this fight. But how can
people fighting for social equality include poor whites who see them
as the enemy?
If poor and working class whites who chant, “Trump, Trump, Trump,”
believe they have little in common with these “enemies,” they are
mistaken. We are all sides of the same coin, a coin that has been held
in the pocket of the elite class since the first settlers arrived in
the American colonies.
I’m no one special. I am a poor, uneducated, white woman. I am the
white underclass, and I am no one’s enemy. I fight for racial equality
because people of color are not my enemy. Gays, lesbians, bisexuals,
and transgender people are not my enemy. Immigrants and refugees are
not my enemy. Muslims are not my enemy. Native Americans are not my
enemy. Single mothers and fathers are not my enemy. People on
Medicare, disability, food stamps, and unemployment are not my enemy.
The homeless are not my enemy. And it turns out that the people of a
small Arkansas town in the middle of the Ozarks are not my enemy.
Other poor people are not the enemy, no matter how they look, how they
pray, or who they love. They are fighting to be heard. They are people
who, like Trump supporters, agree with the statement, “People like me
don’t have any say about what the government does.”
 “Other poor people aren't the enemy, no matter how they look, how
they pray, or who they love.”
Trump supporters believe he’s different. They believe that he cares
about us, that he tells it like it is, that he gives us a voice, that
he can’t be bought because he’s already rich, that he’s railing
against politics as usual.
But does Trump care about the white underclass, or does he still think
poor people are “morons”?
Did slave owners care about white indentured servants when they pitted
them against African slaves, or did they want to ensure a steady
supply of cheap labor? Did Ronald Reagan care about poor white people
when he trotted out the fictional welfare queen, or did he need a
budget item to cut? Do wealthy elites and politicians care about poor
and middle class people when they send them off to war, or are they
anticipating massive profits?
Trump is railing against establishment politics not because he cares
about the white underclass, but because he needs us — for now. He
isn’t reaching out a hand to lift us up. He wants to stand on our
shoulders so we can lift him up.
For more than four hundred years, wealthy elites have depended on the
white underclass to “help keep America great.” But who are we keeping
it great for? When will we realize we have more in common with all
poor people than with rich capitalists and corrupt politicians who
manipulate the system to increase their own wealth, power, and
control? Instead of wondering which billionaire will finally reach out
a hand to raise us up, we should stop waiting and start acting.

“The Revolution is coming and it is a very beautiful revolution.”
“There must be better distribution of wealth and maybe America must
move toward a democratic socialism.”
One of these quotes is from Martin Luther King Jr. in 1966; the other
is from Bernie Sanders in 1969.
Bernie Sanders was born into a working-class home. His father dropped
out of high school and supported the family as a paint salesman after
coming to the U.S. from Poland and struggling through the Great
Depression. Later, after the war, they would find out most of his
family died in the Holocaust. From this, Bernie Sanders learned a life
lesson, “An election in 1932 ended up killing 50 million people around
the world.”
By the time Bernie graduated from college, he was alone. His brother
had moved to England for work, and both of his parents had died. He
moved to Vermont and held a variety of low-wage jobs, spending many of
the following years broke. He is quoted in a New Yorker article as
saying, “I do know what it’s like when the electric company shuts off
the electricity and the phone company shuts off the phone — all that
stuff. So, for me, to talk to working-class people is not very hard.”
He bootstrapped his way into politics and has remained loyal to the
poor and working class for more than thirty years. He is not a
millionaire. He has not built a fortune from his position holding
office. He doesn’t make money by keeping others poor or sending them
to war. He doesn’t gain power by keeping people silent. Donald Trump
would have you believe Sanders is a “loser” for not taking financial
advantage of his position. I prefer to call him one of our own.
Bernie Sanders doesn’t say that if you are poor, it’s your own damn
fault. He says if you are poor, take my hand. Together we can lift you
up. His campaign isn’t about freebies or handouts. It’s about
opportunity. It’s about believing that, given a chance and an even
playing field, the poor and working class can achieve their dreams. He
knows this because he has lived it.
Sanders’ revolution is about lifting the hand of oppression so we can
all move forward in equality. It is about everyone having the same
opportunity to paint their walls in shades of possibility.
When we have been pushed down for so long, it can become impossible to
see whose hands are keeping us there. Is it really welfare queens or
immigrant laborers or Muslims, as Trump claims? I say no, because
those people have so little power. Maybe the answer lies not in
looking up, but in looking sideways and recognizing that our poor
neighbors, who may be different than us, are struggling too. Maybe if
we all look up together, we can see more clearly that the hand of
oppression belongs only to those who have always had money, power, and
control. Those are the real enemies.
The real enemies fear us. They know that if we come together, we will
have the numbers on our side. They’ve always known this and it
terrifies them. We must stop doing what they want: fighting among
ourselves and allowing ourselves to be held down by their fear. We
must direct a truly united voice against those who, four hundred years
ago, created the American Dream and then held it out of reach. We must
join together and fight back against the wealthy elite and corporate
politicians. We must build a new country that belongs to all of us, a
country where no one ever has to feel like just a poor motherfucker no
one cares about.

Certainly, when your life, and the lives of many in your community,
are simultaneously going to be threatened - this type of situation is
known to some in recent times.
When is necessary to take up arms:
"The leader of the resistance of Donbass defends his decision to arm
his supporters. “Raging Ukro-Nazis were beginning to destroy Soviet
monuments. Were we supposed to dutifully wait until this crazy beast
came to us? Or were we to lay down our heads before the heirs of the
Hitlerites and their indigenous henchmen?(…) Time quickly showed that
we were right. In Odessa, where the “Kuliovo Field” movement decided
not to take up weapons in hand and did not worry about the force of
the authorities but instead hoped to peacefully collect signatures for
the autonomy of Novorossiya, their people were simply burned alive. In
Zaporozhye, a rally was brutally broken up by force.”

Part 2:
There are reenactments, footage of actual events, many photos and
details of mass graves etc, of the brutal events in Ukraine, Donbass
and Crimea. Lest anyone suggest we live in a civilized world where
peace and daisies will save us all.

This comment was chosen by Mod HS from the post “International
Military Review – Syria, Feb. 18, 2016”.  The moderator believes this
comment reflects the West’s obsession with President Vladimir Putin
and how their media demonizes him.  The commenter, mmiriww, responds
to the article written by Sharon Tennison. where she shares her
thoughts as the Ukraine situation worsened. Unconscionable
misinformation and hype was being poured on Russia and Vladimir Putin.
Journalists and pundits scoured the Internet and thesauruses to come
up with fiendish new epithets to describe both. Wherever Sharon makes
presentations across America, she finds the first question ominously
asked during Q&A is always, “What about Putin?”.
Comment by mmiriww
Is Putin incorruptible? A U.S. insider’s view of the Russian
president’s character and his country’s transformation.
“What about Putin”
It’s time to share my thoughts which follow: Putin obviously has his
faults and makes mistakes. Based on my earlier experience with him,
and the experiences of trusted people, including U.S. officials who
have worked closely with him over a period of years, Putin most likely
is a straight, reliable and exceptionally inventive man. He is
obviously a long-term thinker and planner and has proven to be an
excellent analyst and strategist. He is a leader who can quietly work
toward his goals under mounds of accusations and myths that have been
steadily leveled at him since he became Russia’s second president.
I’ve stood by silently watching the demonization of Putin grow since
it began in the early 2000s – – Like others who have had direct
experience with this little known man, I’ve tried to no avail to avoid
being labeled a “Putin apologist”. If one is even neutral about him,
they are considered “soft on Putin” by pundits, news hounds and
average citizens who get their news from CNN, Fox and MSNBC.I don’t
pretend to be an expert, just a program developer in the USSR and
Russia for the past 30 years. But during this time, I’ve have had far
more direct, on-ground contact with Russians of all stripes across 11
time zones than any of the Western reporters or for that matter any of
Washington’s officials. I’ve been in country long enough to ponder
Russian history and culture deeply, to study their psychology and
conditioning, and to understand the marked differences between
American and Russian mentalities which so complicate our political
relations with their leaders. As with personalities in a family or a
civic club or in a city hall, it takes understanding and compromise to
be able to create workable relationships when basic conditionings are
different. Washington has been notoriously disinterested in
understanding these differences and attempting to meet Russia
halfway.In addition to my personal experience with Putin, I’ve had
discussions with numerous American officials and U.S. businessmen who
have had years of experience working with him – – I believe it is safe
to say that none would describe him as “brutal” or “thuggish”, or the
other slanderous adjectives and nouns that are repeatedly used in
western media.
I met Putin years before he ever dreamed of being president of Russia,
as did many of us working in St.Petersburg during the 1990s. Since all
of the slander started, I’ve become nearly obsessed with understanding
his character. I think I’ve read every major speech he has given
(including the full texts of his annual hours-long telephone
“talk-ins” with Russian citizens). I’ve been trying to ascertain
whether he has changed for the worse since being elevated to the
presidency, or whether he is a straight character cast into a role he
never anticipated – – and is using sheer wits to try to do the best he
can to deal with Washington under extremely difficult circumstances.
If the latter is the case, and I think it is, he should get high marks
for his performance over the past 14 years. It’s not by accident that
Forbes declared him the most Powerful Leader of 2013, replacing Obama
who was given the title for 2012. The following is my one personal
experience with Putin.
The year was 1992…
It was two years after the implosion of communism; the place was
St.Petersburg. For years I had been creating programs to open up
relations between the two countries and hopefully to help Soviet
people to get beyond their entrenched top-down mentalities. A new
program possibility emerged in my head. Since I expected it might
require a signature from the Marienskii City Hall, an appointment was
made. My friend Volodya Shestakov and I showed up at a side door
entrance to the Marienskii building. We found ourselves in a small,
dull brown office, facing a rather trim nondescript man in a brown
suit. He inquired about my reason for coming in. After scanning the
proposal I provided he began asking intelligent questions. After each
of my answers, he asked the next relevant question. I became aware
that this interviewer was different from other Soviet bureaucrats who
always seemed to fall into chummy conversations with foreigners with
hopes of obtaining bribes in exchange for the Americans’ requests. CCI
stood on the principle that we would never, never give bribes. This
bureaucrat was open, inquiring, and impersonal in demeanor. After more
than an hour of careful questions and answers, he quietly explained
that he had tried hard to determine if the proposal was legal, then
said that unfortunately at the time it was not. A few good words about
the proposal were uttered. That was all. He simply and kindly showed
us to the door. Out on the sidewalk, I said to my colleague, “Volodya,
this is the first time we have ever dealt with a Soviet bureaucrat who
didn’t ask us for a trip to the US or something valuable!” I remember
looking at his business card in the sunlight – – it read Vladimir
Vladimirovich Putin.
Putin as Deputy Mayor of St. Petersburg in the early 90s.
U.S. Consul General Jack Gosnell put in an SOS call to me in
St.Petersburg. He had 14 Congress members and the new American
Ambassador to Russia, Thomas Pickering, coming to St.Petersburg in the
next three days. He needed immediate help. I scurried over to the
Consulate and learned that Jack intended me to brief this auspicious
delegation and the incoming ambassador. I was stunned but he insisted.
They were coming from Moscow and were furious about how U.S. funding
was being wasted there. Jack wanted them to hear the “good news” about
CCI’s programs that were showing fine results. In the next 24 hours
Jack and I also set up “home” meetings in a dozen Russian
entrepreneurs’ small apartments for the arriving dignitaries
(St.Petersburg State Department people were aghast, since it had never
been done before – – but Jack overruled). Only later in 2000, did I
learn of Jack’s former three-year experience with Vladimir Putin in
the 1990s while the latter was running the city for Mayor Sobchak.
More on this further down.
December 31, 1999
With no warning, at the turn of the year, President Boris Yeltsin made
the announcement to the world that from the next day forward he was
vacating his office and leaving Russia in the hands of an unknown
Vladimir Putin. On hearing the news, I thought surely not the Putin I
remembered – – he could never lead Russia. The next day a NYT article
included a photo. Yes, it was the same Putin I’d met years ago! I was
shocked and dismayed, telling friends, “This is a disaster for Russia,
I’ve spent time with this guy, he is too introverted and too
intelligent – – he will never be able to relate to Russia’s masses.”
Further, I lamented: “For Russia to get up off of its knees, two
things must happen: 1) The arrogant young oligarchs have to be removed
by force from the Kremlin, and 2) A way must be found to remove the
regional bosses (governors) from their fiefdoms across Russia’s 89
regions”. It was clear to me that the man in the brown suit would
never have the instincts or guts to tackle Russia’s overriding twin
February 2000
Almost immediately Putin began putting Russia’s oligarchs on edge. In
February a question about the oligarchs came up; he clarified with a
question and his answer: “What should be the relationship with the
so-called oligarchs? The same as anyone else. The same as the owner of
a small bakery or a shoe repair shop.” This was the first signal that
the tycoons would no longer be able to flaunt government regulations
or count on special access in the Kremlin. It also made the West’s
capitalists nervous. After all, these oligarchs were wealthy
untouchable businessmen – – good capitalists, never mind that they got
their enterprises illegally and were putting their profits in offshore
Four months later Putin called a meeting with the oligarchs and gave
them his deal: They could keep their illegally-gained wealth-producing
Soviet enterprises and they would not be nationalized …. IF taxes were
paid on their revenues and if they personally stayed out of politics.
This was the first of Putin’s “elegant solutions” to the near
impossible challenges facing the new Russia. But the deal also put
Putin in crosshairs with US media and officials who then began to
champion the oligarchs, particularly Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The latter
became highly political, didn’t pay taxes, and prior to being
apprehended and jailed was in the process of selling a major portion
of Russia’s largest private oil company, Yukos Oil, to Exxon Mobil.
Unfortunately, to U.S. media and governing structures, Khodorkovsky
became a martyr (and remains so up to today).
March 2000
I arrived in St.Petersburg. A Russian friend (a psychologist) since
1983 came for our usual visit. My first question was, “Lena what do
you think about your new president?” She laughed and retorted,
“Volodya! I went to school with him!” She began to describe Putin as a
quiet youngster, poor, fond of martial arts, who stood up for kids
being bullied on the playgrounds. She remembered him as a patriotic
youth who applied for the KGB prematurely after graduating secondary
school (they sent him away and told him to get an education). He went
to law school, later reapplied and was accepted. I must have grimaced
at this, because Lena said, “Sharon in those days we all admired the
KGB and believed that those who worked there were patriots and were
keeping the country safe. We thought it was natural for Volodya to
choose this career. My next question was, “What do you think he will
do with Yeltsin’s criminals in the Kremlin?” Putting on her
psychologist hat, she pondered and replied, “If left to his normal
behaviors, he will watch them for a while to be sure what is going on,
then he will throw up some flares to let them know that he is
watching. If they don’t respond, he will address them personally, then
if the behaviors don’t change – – some will be in prison in a couple
of years.” I congratulated her via email when her predictions began to
show up in real time.
Throughout the 2000s
St.Petersburg’s many CCI alumni were being interviewed to determine
how the PEP business training program was working and how we could
make the U.S. experience more valuable for their new small businesses.
Most believed that the program had been enormously important, even
life changing. Last, each was asked, “So what do you think of your new
president?” None responded negatively, even though at that time
entrepreneurs hated Russia’s bureaucrats. Most answered similarly,
“Putin registered my business a few years ago”. Next question, “So,
how much did it cost you?” To a person they replied, “Putin didn’t
charge anything”. One said, “We went to Putin’s desk because the
others providing registrations at the Marienskii were getting ‘rich on
their seats.’”
Late 2000
Into Putin’s first year as Russia’s president, US officials seemed to
me to be suspect that he would be antithetical to America’s interests
– – his every move was called into question in American media. I
couldn’t understand why and was chronicling these happenings in my
computer and newsletters.
Year 2001
Jack Gosnell (former USCG mentioned earlier) explained his
relationship with Putin when the latter was deputy mayor of
St.Petersburg. The two of them worked closely to create joint ventures
and other ways to promote relations between the two countries. Jack
related that Putin was always straight up, courteous and helpful. When
Putin’s wife, Ludmila, was in a severe auto accident, Jack took the
liberty (before informing Putin) to arrange hospitalization and
airline travel for her to get medical care in Finland. When Jack told
Putin, he reported that the latter was overcome by the generous offer,
but ended saying that he couldn’t accept this favor, that Ludmila
would have to recover in a Russian hospital. She did – – although
medical care in Russia was abominably bad in the 1990s.
A senior CSIS officer I was friends with in the 2000s worked closely
with Putin on a number of joint ventures during the 1990s. He reported
that he had no dealings with Putin that were questionable, that he
respected him and believed he was getting an undeserved dour
reputation from U.S. media. Matter of fact, he closed the door at CSIS
when we started talking about Putin. I guessed his comments wouldn’t
be acceptable if others were listening.
Another former U.S. official who will go unidentified, also reported
working closely with Putin, saying there was never any hint of
bribery, pressuring, nothing but respectable behaviors and
I had two encounters in 2013 with State Department officials regarding Putin:
At the first one, I felt free to ask the question I had previously
yearned to get answered: “When did Putin become unacceptable to
Washington officials and why? Without hesitating the answer came back:
“‘The knives were drawn’ when it was announced that Putin would be the
next president.” I questioned WHY? The answer: “I could never find out
why – – maybe because he was KGB.” I offered that Bush  was head of
the CIA. The reply was, “That would have made no difference, he was
our guy.”
The second was a former State Department official with whom I recently
shared a radio interview on Russia. Afterward when we were chatting, I
remarked, “You might be interested to know that I’ve collected
experiences of Putin from numerous people, some over a period of
years, and they all say they had no negative experiences with Putin
and there was no evidence of taking bribes”. He firmly replied, “No
one has ever been able to come up with a bribery charge against
against Putin …. even accusations of assassinations, poisonings, and
comparing him to Hitler. No one yet has come up with any concrete
evidence for these allegations. During this time, I’ve traveled
throughout Russia several times every year, and have watched the
country slowly change under Putin’s watch. Taxes were lowered,
inflation lessened, and laws slowly put in place. Schools and
hospitals began improving. Small businesses were growing, agriculture
was showing improvement, and stores were becoming stocked with food.
Alcohol challenges were less obvious, smoking was banned from
buildings, and life expectancy began increasing. Highways were being
laid across the country, new rails and modern trains appeared even in
far out places, and the banking industry was becoming dependable.
Russia was beginning to look like a decent country – – certainly not
where Russians hoped it to be long term, but improving incrementally
for the first time in their memories.
My 2013/14 Trips to Russia Modern Russia, thriving
In addition to St.Petersburg and Moscow, in September I traveled out
to the Ural Mountains, spent time in Ekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk and
Perm. We traveled between cities via autos and rail – – the fields and
forests look healthy, small towns sport new paint and construction.
Today’s Russians look like Americans (we get the same clothing from
China). Old concrete Khrushchev block houses are giving way to new
multi-story private residential complexes which are lovely. High-rise
business centers, fine hotels and great restaurants are now common
place – – and ordinary Russians frequent these places. Two and three
story private homes rim these Russian cities far from Moscow. We
visited new museums, municipal buildings and huge super markets.
Streets are in good repair, highways are new and well marked now,
service stations looks like those dotting American highways. In
January I went to Novosibirsk out in Siberia where similar new
architecture was noted. Streets were kept navigable with constant
snowplowing, modern lighting kept the city bright all night, lots of
new traffic lights (with seconds counting down to light change) have
appeared. It is astounding to me how much progress Russia has made in
the past 14 years since an unknown man with no experience walked into
Russia’s presidency and took over a country that was flat on its
So why do our leaders and media demean and demonize Putin and Russia???
Like Lady MacBeth, do they protest too much?
Psychologists tell us that people (and countries?) project off on
others what they don’t want to face in themselves. Others carry our
“shadow” when we refuse to own it. We confer on others the very traits
that we are horrified to acknowledge in ourselves.
Could this be why we constantly find fault with Putin and Russia?
Could it be that we project on to Putin the sins of ourselves and our leaders?
Could it be that we condemn Russia’s corruption, acting like the
corruption within our corporate world doesn’t exist?
Could it be that we condemn their human rights and LGBT issues, not
facing the fact that we haven’t solved our own?
Could it be that we accuse Russia of “reconstituting the USSR” – –
because of what we do to remain the world’s “hegemon”?
Could it be that we project nationalist behaviors on Russia, because
that is what we have become and we don’t want to face it?
Could it be that we project warmongering off on Russia, because of
what we have done over the past several administrations?
There is a well known code of ethics among us: Is it the Truth, Is it
Fair, Does it build Friendship and Goodwill, and Will it be Beneficial
for All Concerned?
It seems to me that if our nation’s leaders would commit to using
these four principles in international relations, the world would
operate in a completely different manner, and human beings across this
planet would live in better conditions than they do today.

America 'encouraging' Iraq into allowing permanent US military bases in Iraq.
America the 'global cop' is also America the 'schoolyard bully'.
Bloody and shameful.
US Military Chopper Transfers ISIL Leaders from Fallujah to Unknown
Location - 21 February 2016
Informed sources disclosed that a US-made helicopter has taken several
senior ISIL leaders out of Anbar province in Western Iraq to an
unknown location.
“A US chopper landed in a farm near the main road linking
al-Saqlaviyeh to Fallujah in Anbar province and took off  after one
hour with ISIL leaders on board,” the Arabic-language Sama Baghdad
news website quoted informed Iraqi sources in Fallujah city as saying
on Sunday.
The sources noted that several ISIL leaders had gathered in Fallujah
farm as if they had been informed of the helicopter’s imminent landing
in the farm.
In a relevant development on February 13, senior Iraqi security
sources lashed out at the US and its regional allies for supporting
Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, and said that Washington is the main cause
of ISIL’s survival in his country.
“We have compelling evidence that a US helicopter landed in Albu Arim
palms of Fallujah city to take out the ISIL leaders who were in
contact with the Americans,” a senior Iraqi security official,
speaking on the condition of anonymity, told FNA.
He noted that other US aircraft were flying over the region to protect
the airplane which was boarding the ISIL leaders, adding, “The US took
out the ISIL leaders in order to rescue them from possible attacks by
the Iraqi Army and security forces.”
In relevant remarks in October, Spokesman of Iraq’s Kata’ib Hezbollah
(Hezbollah Battalions) popular forces Jafar al-Hosseini disclosing
that captured ISIL leaders have acknowledged receiving logistical
backup and intelligence support from the US.
“As the ISIL commanders captured in Iraqi popular forces’ recent
military operations have confessed, the US supports for the terrorist
groups are not limited to the dispatch of logistical support,”
Al-Hosseini told FNA.
He reiterated that the US has provided the ISIL with intelligence
about the Iraqi forces’ positions and targets.
“ISIL commanders trusted the US officials who had assured them that
the Iraqi forces would not attack Fallujah because the US had urged
the Iraqi government to prevent the popular forces from entering
Fallujah and raid Beiji instead; hence the terrorists left Fallujah
for Beiji to stay on the alert in there,” Al-Hosseini added.
Al-Hosseini had also stated on Wednesday that his forces plan to win
back the city of Ramadi only after expelling the American forces from
Anbar province.
“Our forces have two operations underway; first seizing Ramadi from
ISIL and second keeping away the American forces from Anbar province,”
al-Hosseini told FNA.
He underlined that preventing the US forces from getting close to
Anbar province will expedite operations for winning back the province,
specially after the military operations in Salahuddin province that
led to the liberation of the city of Beiji.
Iraqi officials have on different occasions blasted the US and its
allies for supplying the ISIL in Syria with arms and ammunition under
the pretext of fighting the Takfiri terrorist group.
Also in October, the Iraqi army and volunteer forces discovered
US-made military hardware and ammunition, including anti-armor
missiles, in terrorists’ positions and trenches captured during the
operations in the Fallujah region in Al-Anbar province.
The Iraqi forces found a huge volume of advanced TOW-II missiles from
the Takfiri terrorists in al-Karama city of Fallujah.
The missiles were brand new and the ISIL had transferred them to
Fallujah to use them against the Iraqi army’s armored units.
On October 10, the Iraqi forces discovered US-made military hardware
and ammunition from terrorists in Beiji.
“The military hardware and weapons had been airdropped by the US-led
warplanes and choppers for the ISIL in the nearby areas of Beiji,”
military sources told FNA.
In February 2015, an Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the
western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri
terrorists in Iraq, revealing that the US airplanes still continue to
airdrop weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL terrorists.
“The US planes have dropped weapons for the ISIL terrorists in the
areas under ISIL control and even in those areas that have been
recently liberated from the ISIL control to encourage the terrorists
to return to those places,” Coordinator of Iraqi popular forces Jafar
al-Jaberi told FNA.
He noted that eyewitnesses in Al-Havijeh of Kirkuk province had
witnessed the US airplanes dropping several suspicious parcels for
ISIL terrorists in the province.
“Two coalition planes were also seen above the town of Al-Khas in
Diyala and they carried the Takfiri terrorists to the region that has
recently been liberated from the ISIL control,” Al-Jaberi said.
Also in February 2015, a senior lawmaker disclosed that Iraq’s army
has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the
ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province.
“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has
access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed
while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee
Hakem al-Zameli said.
He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.
The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in
Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in
al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes
that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.
The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the
terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation
in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as
it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.
Also in February 2015, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out
at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting
Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons
have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.
“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and
Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi
region,” the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial
Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.
He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel
were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city
of Ramadi.
Meantime, Head of Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense
Committee Hakem al-Zameli also disclosed that the anti-ISIL
coalition’s planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in
Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.
In January 2015, al-Zameli underlined that the coalition is the main
cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.
“There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition’s military aid
to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),” he told FNA at the
He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that
the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft
weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation
committee to probe into the matter.
“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about
the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the
reality with its allegations.
He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence
provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the
popular forces, and said, “These documents are given to the
investigation committee … and the necessary measures will be taken to
protect the Iraqi airspace.”
Also in January 2015, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that
the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.
“The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL
and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,” Jome
Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament,
He said the coalition’s support for the ISIL is now evident to
everyone, and continued, “The coalition has not targeted ISIL’s main
positions in Iraq.”
In Late December 2014, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense
Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist
organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.
MP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out
that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin
province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.
He added that the US and the international coalition are “not serious
in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the
technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and
destroy them in one month”.
Gharawi added that “the US is trying to expand the time of the war
against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have
its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.”
Salahuddin security commission also disclosed that “unknown planes

@_subject: Reminders of why USAgov and NATO must be dismantled 
Kosovo: An Evil Little War (Almost) All US Candidates Liked
Nebojsa Malic
Originally appeared at RT (
 )
Although the 2016 presidential election is still in the primaries
phase, contenders have already brought up America’s failed foreign
wars. Hillary Clinton is taking flak over Libya, and Donald Trump has
irked the GOP by bringing up Iraq. But what of Kosovo?
The US-led NATO operation that began on March 24, 1999 was launched
under the “responsibility to protect” doctrine asserted by President
Bill Clinton and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. For 78 days, NATO
targeted what was then the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia – which
later split into Serbia and Montenegro – over alleged atrocities
against ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo.
Yugoslavia was accused of “ethnic cleansing” and “genocide” as bombs
rained on bridges, trains, hospitals, homes, the power grid and even
refugee convoys.
NATO’s actions directly violated the UN Charter (articles 53 and 103),
its own charter, the 1975 Helsinki Final Act and the 1980 Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties. The war was a crime against peace,
pure and simple.
Though overwhelmed, Yugoslavia did not surrender; the June 1999
armistice only allowed NATO to occupy Kosovo under UN peacekeeping
authority, granted by Resolution 1244 – which the Alliance has been
violating ever since.
US Secretary of State at the time, Madeleine Albright, was considered
the most outspoken champion of the “Kosovo War.” She is now a vocal
supporter of candidate Clinton, condemning (
 )
women who don’t vote for her to a “special place in Hell.”
Clinton visited the renegade province in October 2012, as the outgoing
Secretary of State. She stood with the ‘Kosovan’ government leaders –
once considered terrorists, before receiving US backing – and
proclaimed unequivocal US support for Kosovo’s independence,
proclaimed four years prior.
“For me, my family and my fellow Americans this is more than a foreign
policy issue, it is personal,” Clinton said. Given the Kosovo
Albanians had renamed a major street in their capital ‘Bill Clinton
Avenue’ and erected a massive gilded monument to Hillary’s husband,
her comments were hardly a surprise.
She is unlikely to be condemned for those remarks by her rival for the
Democratic presidential nomination, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
While arguing that Congress should have a say in authorizing the
intervention, Sanders entirely bought into the mainstream narrative
about the conflict, seeing it as a case of the evil Serbian “dictator”
Slobodan Milosevic oppressing the unarmed ethnic Albanians. He saw
“supporting the NATO airstrikes on Serbia as justified on humanitarian
grounds” ( One Sanders aide, Jeremy Brecher, resigned in May 1999 (
) arguing against the intervention as it unfolded, since the “goal of
US policy is not to save the Kosovars from ongoing destruction.”
Trouble is there was no “destruction.” Contrary to NATO claims of
100,000 or more Albanians purportedly massacred by the Serbs, postwar
investigators found fewer than 5,000 deaths – 1,500 of which happened
after NATO occupied the province and the Albanian pogroms began.
Western media, eager to preserve the narrative of noble NATO defeating
the evil Serbs, dismissed the terror as “revenge killings.” NATO
troops thus looked on as their Albanian protégés terrorized, torched,
bombed and pillaged across the province for years, forcing some
250,000 Serbs, Jews, Roma, and other groups into exile.
After George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, his administration
adopted the Clinton-era agenda for the Balkans, including backing an
independent Albanian state in Kosovo. None of the Republicans, save
2012 contender Ron Paul, have criticized the Kosovo War since.
Billionaire businessman Donald Trump actually has been critical –
though back in 1999, long before he became the Republican front-runner
and the bane of the GOP establishment. In October that year, Trump was
a guest on Larry King’s CNN show, criticizing (
 )
the Clintons’ handling of the Kosovo War after a fashion.
    “But look at what we’ve done to that land and to those people and
the deaths that we’ve caused,” Trump told King. “They bombed the hell
out of a country, out of a whole area, everyone is fleeing in every
different way, and nobody knows what’s happening, and the deaths are
going on by the thousands.”
The problem with Trump, then as now, is that he is maddeningly vague.
So, these remarks could be interpreted as referring to the terror
going on at that very moment – the persecution of non-Albanians under
NATO’s approving eye – or the exodus of Albanians earlier that year,
during the NATO bombing. Only Trump would know which, and he hasn’t
offered a clarification.
Though he has the most delegates and leads in the national polls for
the Republican nomination, the GOP establishment is furious with Trump
because he dared call (
 ) George W.
Bush a liar and describe the invasion of Iraq as a “big fat mistake.”
According to the British historian Kate Hudson (
 ), however,
the 2003 invasion was just a continuation of the “pattern of
aggression,” following the precedent set with Kosovo.
     of Serbs in  happened under UN & NATO
administration. Crime without punishment for 11th year.

    March 17, 2015 (  )
Last week Secretary of State John Kerry reluctantly branded (
 ) the actions
of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) in Iraq and Syria
“genocidal” towards the Christians, Yazidis, Shiites and other groups.
He cited examples of how IS destroyed churches, cemeteries and
monuments, and murdered people simply because of who they were.
It was March 17, eight years to the day since 50,000 Albanians began a
three-day pogrom in Kosovo, doing the very same things – while their
activists in the US were raising funds for the very same John Kerry,
as he ran for president as the Democratic candidate.
Karadjic Told Me: 'I Saved Serbs From Genocide. God Knows We Are Right'
Personal reflections on a Serb leader who was sentenced to 40 years in
prison for crimes against humanity
Daria Aslamova (Komsomolskay Pravda)

Translated by Julia Rakhmetova and Rhod Mackenzie
The author is a veteran war correspondent who reported from numerous
hot spots throughout the world
This man gave me my first professional tape recorder (his own). With
this man I drank wine at night in the town of Pale near Sarajevo in
March, 1993, during the Bosnian War, with him reading me his poems in
Serbian. A poet and psychiatrist, the Serbian politician Radovan
Karadjic was  sentenced (  ) to
40 years' imprisonment by a duplicitous International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for ‘crimes against humanity’ (
 ).
They even blamed him for ‘genocide (
 ) against Bosnian Muslims (
 )’ in the town of Srebrenica
when he had nothing to do with it. He was a politician, not a general.
(By the way, when the ‘world community’ refers to the massacre of
Muslim men in Srebrenica, it forgets that it was in reprisal for the
murder of Serbian villagers in neighboring towns and villages).
There was a cruel civil war taking place in Bosnia back then, which
began with shootings at a Serbian wedding party in Sarajevo. Bosnian
Muslims got help from the West and the Muslim world, but no one helped
the Serbs. Even Russia, though making loud statements, refused to
supply arms.
The Bosnian Muslims received $2 billion (!) to purchase arms over the
3 years of the war, and 4,500 Al-Qaeda jihadists came to the country
thanks to the US, including Osama Ben Laden. They cut off Serbs’ heads
and threw them like cabbages into a basket. We have shocking
photographs  (not
recommended for people under 18 and sensitive adults) of those
murders. The murderers are still alive and recruiting new young
terrorists around the world, including for ISIS.  When arrested, they
were provided with new passports. And now for that interview with
    "My job was great”, - he said. “Thousands of Serbs were liberated
and avoided genocide. Our biggest mistake was poor propaganda. The
world is against us because we were proud and didn’t want to be
humiliated by making excuses. We let this happen, and now the world
considers Serbs evil incarnate.
    Yes, it’s bad for us. But as a psychiatrist, I can say that the
law that applies to an individual, such as ‘stay alone and you will
become mature’, also applies to a nation. Forced isolation will break
him down if he is spiritually weak, or he will rise above it, if he is
worth it. Now the Serbs are alone but this will bring them spiritual
growth and wisdom. God knows we are in the right.”
Sometimes it seems to me that he’s talking about us Russians.

On America's intentions:
An ominous wire report sent a shiver down my spine when I read it. On
January 28, US Army Lieutenant General Sean MacFarland, head of the
US-led coalition against Daesh (ISIL) in Iraq and Syria, said that the
US military was on site at the Mosul Dam to assess “the potential” for
the collapse. Were it to be blown up, it would send a flood of water
down the heavily populated Tigris river valley. “The likelihood of the
dam collapsing is something we are trying to determine right now… all
we know is when it goes, it’s going to go fast and that’s bad,”
MacFarland told reporters in Baghdad. The US State Department
estimates up to 500,000 people could be killed and over one million
rendered homeless should Iraq’s biggest dam collapse.

China-led AIIB, World Bank to approve joint projects in June
April 14, 2016, 6:35 am

Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) President Jin Liqun exchange
documents after signing the first co-financing framework agreement at
the headquarters of World Bank in Washington D.C., the United States,
April 13, 2016 [Xinhua]
The China-led AIIB, alongwith the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank will approve the first batch of co-financed projects in June,
AIIB President Jin Liqun said Wednesday.
“I would say a huge amount of chemistry has already been nurtured
between the AIIB and the World Bank, the AIIB and the ADB,” Jin said
at an event in Washington.
“We are working with the World Bank and the ADB for co-financing.
Maybe in June, we could have couples of projects approved by the World
Bank, by the ADB, and by us” he said.
The US had officially opposed the creation of the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank (AIIB) (
). The emergence of the world’s first major multilateral development
bank in a generation had riled up many at the World Bank.
The China-led international lender, AIIB, is also “processing
freestanding projects” prepared by its own experts, Jin said on
“Infrastructure projects are very large.
It’s not a very good idea for one bank to spend 2 billion or 3 billion
U.S. dollars on one project,” he said, adding that there is vast room
for cooperation among multilateral development banks.
The $100-billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will boost
infrastructure investment in Asia and improve integration, China’s
President Xi Jinping said in January this year.
In its first year of operation, the AIIB expects to approve about $1.2
billion in financing, some of these will be in joint projects with the
World Bank.
“When we work together, we can actually help the host country improve
its macroeconomic policy environment,” he argued.
As the pent-up demand for infrastructure could be as high as 10
trillion dollars over the next decade, Jin said there’s no competition
but “only cooperation and coordination” between the AIIB and other
development banks.
On Wednesday, the AIIB and the World Bank signed the first
co-financing framework agreement, paving the way for their cooperation
on joint projects this year.
“Signing this agreement enables our institutions to finance
development projects together, and that is an important first step
toward working with a new partner to address the world’s huge
infrastructure needs,” World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said.
While there are huge demands for infrastructure in Asia, Jin said the
AIIB has to “be selective” and invest in good projects that meet its
standards of “financially sustainable, environmentally friendly and
socially acceptable.”
Given the broad definition of infrastructure in the bank’s mandate,
Jin said the AIIB could provide finance for non-physical
infrastructure like health and education in the future.
Jin also noted that the AIIB could support projects under China’s Belt
and Road initiative, but it was not created exclusively for this
“We would finance infrastructure projects in all emerging market
economies even though they don’t belong to the Belt and Road
initiative,” he said.
The AIIB has 57 prospective founding members, including some key US
allies, with an authorized capital of $100 billion.
The bank was formally established in Beijing in December last year and
started operation in January.
The AIIB is one of three entities China is promoting, along with a
joint $100 billion BRICS Development Bank and a $40 billion Silk Road
TBP and Agencies
So US power players decided they not want to sing too many refrains of
"I'm ronely, so ronely" joining the party instead.

Being a great fan of personal liberty to the extent the individual
does not harm another, I can only wholeheartedly support the premises
and observations laid out in the following article.
The "war" on drugs not only does not reduce crime, number of
prisoners, nor as far as we can see since Vietnam nor does it reduce
drug use, but as far as I can tell, the war on drugs only fuels crime,
creating the black markets, creating criminals, causing great angst
and physical health problems for those who are addicted, and
drastically increasing the prison population of "criminals" for
victimless "crimes".
Humans will be human. There will always be those humans who wish to
experiment, or to make life long use their choice or addicted
non-choice as the case may be, whether their drug(s) of choice be
alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, heroine, ice, ecstasy or
anything else. Humans will be human and so logically there is NO
FIRETRUCKING POINT in making crimes out of "normal" human behaviour
and choices, where those choices and behaviours harm no one other than
(at most) the individual themselves.
Prohibition never worked.
Alcohol got legalized again, marijuana is on a slowish road to
re-legalization and many of us are aware of DuPont's cotton empire and
political connections causing the prohibition of marijuana.
Indeed, prohibition has only -ever- made the reality on the ground,
for the users/ addicted to that which is prohibited, much worse,
except of course for those police, government, military and other
outlaw gangs who profit from the prohibition - read Victoria Police
Corruption (Hoser) for various Australian examples.
We can only hope that the tending to be somewhat more intellectual
"public conversation" that occurs in Russia will turn to such rational
observations, be supported with bold honest public discussion, and
that they can move their collective political selves in the only
rational "harm minimization" direction - legalizing all drugs, at the
very least on prescription for those who are addicted.
All together now let us pray, pray for the poppies.

Robert De Niro and Autism – a Tragic Drama of Intimidation
Column: Society
Region: USA in the World
Robert De Niro is a magnificent actor, one who has won countless
awards in his profession over decades. Recently he involved himself in
a drama that is costing millions of tragic lives to be condemned to a
special world of autism. What has developed from that involvement is
tragic. Not alone because his own son is autistic
( On March 25 the New York Times printed an article with the title,
“Robert De Niro Defends Screening of Anti-Vaccine Film at Tribeca
Festival.” It was a decision deeply personal for De Niro and his wife.
De Niro, co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival, defended the
festival’s controversial decision to screen an anti-vaccine
documentary, Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe. De Niro explained,
“Grace and I have a child with autism and we believe it is critical
that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly
discussed and examined. This is very personal to me and my family and
I want there to be a discussion, which is why we will be screening
Vaxxed. I am not personally endorsing the film, nor am I
anti-vaccination; I am only providing the opportunity for a
conversation around the issue
( That was a clear statement and a courageous act. De Niro made the
decision not only to premier the Vaxxed film at his film festivan bust
also to introduce the Director, Andrew Wakefield and the film
personally. Before deciding, De Niro contacted US Congressman Bill
Posey, the same Congressman who has spoken directly and at length with
the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Whistleblower William Thompson (
In 2014 Thompson told Posey and others that the CDC, where he had been
employed as a scientist, had documents that CDC officials deliberately
suppressed tests that indicated links between the common MMR
vaccine–Measles, Mumps and Rubella (whooping cough)– and child autism.
After a one hour discussion with Posey on what he had been told by
Thompson about the CDC autism coverup, De Niro made his personal
decision to present the Wakefield film (
). Forty eight hours and a firestorm of mainstream media attack on De
Niro’s decision led to his reversal of the screening.
In 2015 CDC whistleblower William Thompson, in an apparent act of
conscience, told US Congressman Posey that while a senior scientist at
CDC, he and his colleagues, after making a study of the link between
vaccines and incidence of autism in small black boys, “scheduled a
meeting to destroy documents related to the study. The remaining four
co-authors all met and brought a big garbage can into the meeting
room, and reviewed and went through all the hardcopy documents that we
had thought we should discard, and put them into a huge garbage can.”
The…co-authors…brought a big garbage can into the meeting room… [and
put the documents]…into a huge garbage can. –CDC Senior Scientist Dr.
William Thompson (
).  A cowered US Congress declined to even hold hearings on Thompson’s
charges, charges that could have brought the global vaccine industry
down if held honestly. The pharmaceutical industry makes enormous
financial contributions to Congressional candidates in key committees.
Autism Epidemic and Rise in Vaccinations
Once De Niro announced he would premier the Vaxxed film at his film
festival, a savage firestorm of attacks erupted from US mainstream
media ranging from New York Times to forces to CNN. They all attacked
Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the Director of Vaxxed, a British citizen,
medical doctor and scientist who was literally crucified, stripped of
his medical license in Britain and attacked as a scientific fraud for
publishing a study in 1998 in the respected scientific journal,
Lancet, on possible links between MMR vaccinations and an alarming
rise in child autism. Only in 2010 after twelve years of relentless
pressure and attacks on Wakefield and claims of faulty methodology did
Lancet finally retract the article (
I have personally met and talked at length with Andrew Wakefield and
have respect for his refusal to be cowered by the pharmaceutical
vaccine cartel. I have also met numerous children in clinics and
rehabilitation centers who have been maimed, crippled or mentally
turned into vegetables from vaccinations. Their stories are hushed up
by the medical industry, a trillion dollar cartel that links countless
medical professionals, scientists, pharmaceutical makers, the CDC and
the WHO.
What none of the mainstream, politically correct, media dares to
report in the De Niro-Wakefield debate are the alarming facts of the
epidemic rise in autism in the USA over the past two decades. Autism
rates climbed nearly 30% between 2008 and 2010. Incidents of child
autism have more than doubled since 2000 according to a new study from
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The condition
affects one of every 68 children who are 8-year-olds. That’s up from
one in 88 just two years earlier. Thirty years ago autism in the USA
was virtually unheard of (
When it was first described in 1943 by Leo Kanner, it was believed to
occur at a rate of 4–5 per 10,000 children. Today, 1 in 68 (
The CDC claims not to know the cause. It is clearly not genetic change
because such changes take many generations to manifest. Therefore it
must be a significant change in the environment of the children.
In 2011, Dr. Helen Ratajczak, herself a former senior scientist in the
pharmaceutical industry published a groundbreaking article in the
Journal of Immunotoxicology entitled “Theoretical aspects of autism:
Causes–A review.” Ratajczak did what nobody else apparently has
bothered to do: she reviewed the body of published science since
autism was first described in 1943. Not just one theory suggested by
research such as the role of MMR shots, or the mercury preservative
thimerosal; but all of them.
Ratajczak’s article states, in part, that “Documented causes of autism
include genetic mutations and/or deletions, viral infections, and
encephalitis [brain damage] following vaccination [emphasis added].
Therefore, autism is the result of genetic defects and/or inflammation
of the brain.”
The article goes on to discuss many potential vaccine-related
culprits, including the increasing number of vaccines given in a short
period of time. CBS award-winning journalist Sharyl Attkisson
interviewed Ratajczak on her findings. “What I have published is
highly concentrated on hypersensitivity, Ratajczak told Attkisson in
an interview, “the body’s immune system being thrown out of balance.”
No less a scientist than Dr. James R. Shannon, former Director,
National Institute of Health, stated, “The only safe vaccine is one
that is never used (
).” Robert De Niro is a magnificent actor. He let go of an opportunity
to give mankind far more.

Donald Trump Loves Vladimir Putin: What the Hell is Going On?
Column: Politics
Region: USA in the World
4534544The world follows every US Presidential election race because
the outcome affects billions of peoples’ lives. There isn’t a country
anywhere untouched by US policy. So it matters a great deal who is in
charge, and what the person is likely to do if elected.
As most Americans are observing with some horror, the Republican
primaries are consistently throwing up the scenario even that party’s
establishment doesn’t want. Despite all the party bosses’ attempts to
stop him, billionaire businessman and reality TV star Donald Trump has
emerged as the most popular candidate.
At the time of writing Trump had gained the support of around 755
pledged delegates, as opposed to 521 for his nearest rival, Ted Cruz
of Texas. Despite being considered a joke at the beginning of the
campaign, Trump is so far ahead that 90% of the remaining delegates
would have to pledge for Cruz to stop Trump becoming the Republican
presidential candidate.
Trump is scaring people because he is not so much right-wing as from
another planet. He has views on immigrants, the poor, and the
unemployed which would make the most reactionary dictators in history
blush. He also happily accepts being labelled a fascist in a country
with a large and sensitive Jewish population.
Therefore it would be entirely consistent for this man to be
virulently anti-Russian, as Russia has long been synonymous, in
American eyes, with all the things Trump thinks are wrong with the
country.But nothing could be further from the truth. Trump has
expressed great admiration for Vladimir Putin, and pledged to work
with him, as an ally, if he becomes president. Putin in turn has
described Trump as an “outstanding man” and “unquestionably talented (
 )”.

referred to the USSR as the “Evil Empire”, seemed amazing at the time.
But it is nowhere near as weird as a US-Russia friendship with Trump
in charge. Wouldn’t Trump rather nuke the place to bits and fill
what’s left of it with Mexicans?What on earth is going on?
The Joke That Is All Too Serious
Trump is striking a chord with a significant portion of the US
electorate because only the US could have produced a Donald Trump. The
characteristics of that society have made him what he is, and even his
opponents have to accept that he is a recognisable, albeit unpleasant,
face of their country.
You can often tell what a country is like when you see what provokes a
response there but not elsewhere. For example, in France it is a very
serious offence to write an anonymous letter, even an anodyne or
complimentary one, because people remember the anonymous denunciations
of members of the Resistance to the Nazis. Other countries do not see
what the fuss is about.
In the US there is an attitude towards big business which other
countries never quite get. In most countries businessmen are seen as
boring, or the enemies of the ordinary man. They wear their own
clothes, speak their own language and have concerns which the rest of
the world aren’t interested in; the business section of a newspaper is
the one you most often find discarded on a train or bus.
In the US it is different. Becoming a big businessman from humble
origins is the so-called American Dream. Only millionaires can
effectively compete in national politics, not simply because there are
no spending limits but because that is how they gain the necessary
public respect. Business is a glamorous world in the US, and top
businessmen are celebrities in the same way rock stars and actors are
in other countries, because they are what every American is told they
should aspire to be.
Trump was a celebrity long before he started appearing on business
advice programmes, simply because he was a famous businessman. Not for
him the corporate dinners and army of secretaries to protect him from
the public. Only in America could someone like Trump be the subject of
a Comedy Central Celebrity Roast, in which comedians line up to insult
someone the audience know as a household name (
But this celebrity doesn’t come with anything else. It isn’t earned by
having anything to say, simply by the machinery of American society
itself, as Martin Scorsese’s film “The King of Comedy” cruelly exposed
(  ). The last thing
Americans want is for such celebrities to say and do anything
reasonable, which reduces them to the level of mere mortals. They have
to be larger than life to remain celebrities and icons, and Trump is
now working this to the full.
The Republican Party has long argued that a liberal intelligentsia has
imposed alien views on the ordinary American. It is no coincidence
that the outrageous radio “shock jocks” who go out of their way to be
confrontational are right-wing, not radical left as they would be in
most countries. As Fareed Zakaria has pointed out, Republicans have
openly courted racists and made wilful ignorance into a badge of
honour to reposition themselves as the anti-political party.
Now Trump is capitalising on his celebrity the only way he is allowed
to. He could never be a serious candidate – Reagan only became a
politician years after giving up acting. By articulating the most
extreme positions, he is giving a voice to those who do a lot of noisy
posturing to distance themselves from practical politicians who can’t
afford to deal in slogans for the sake of it.
Trump is the Republican Frankenstein’s monster, the man they have
encouraged Americans to admire, however much they are trying to
subvert him now. But what is the US itself? Does it act in the
civilized, humane way it preaches, or go around the world adopting the
same attitudes towards others as Trump does, and taking the same
action against them as Trump advocates?
The Closet Russian in Wolf’s Clothing
In fact Putin has very good reasons for wanting to work with Trump,
and vice versa. Both Trump’s Republican and Democratic rivals are
quite content to continue with the traditional US policy of saying one
thing and doing the other. The fact that Hillary Clinton is leading
the Democratic race demonstrates this.
Trump really will try and do what he says, even though most of what he
says is obnoxious and cannot be done. Putin will know what he is
getting with Trump, and has good reason to think that the world is
better off with honesty, even if it is stupid in content.
Similarly, Dangerous Donald is very happy to take Putin on the terms
the US wants to take him on. In his comic book world, Putin is a tough
guy who swaggers around doing whatever he wants. While most of the US
would see this as a negative thing, this is what Trump himself
desperately wants to be. He’d rather have Putin in the same gang than
another one, when he knows his own wealth and fame were built on
bluster rather than being the genius he presents himself as.
If Putin has to work with Trump he will work with the real America,
and be very happy doing so. At present, he waits for the US to
compromise itself and then takes the same action himself to undermine
US hegemony. With Trump in charge, he won’t have to wait. The US will
openly do what it pretends not to now, and Putin will advance Russia’s
interests every time Donald opens his mouth.
Actions Speak Louder Than Reality
Trump supporters, who were told he had no chance, are now displaying
their colours with increasing bravado. Recent Trump rallies have
descended into riots, with his own supporters trying to out-tough each
other ( ). With his hate rhetoric attracting people precisely because they
know that the “liberal intelligentsia” rejects it, violence is
similarly seen as a manifestation of “True Americanness” because it
will be even more condemned by the same people.
The reason Trump’s admiration for Putin has not seen him branded a
closet liberal by these people, as it should logically have done, is
because he has given a particular reason for it. He has stated, quite
reasonably, that the US is wasting money on all the conflicts it is
involved in and these interventions have left all those countries
worse off than before.
Trump ascribes this waste of US money and lives to the liberal
intelligentsia mentality of getting involved in civil conflicts for
arcane policy reasons, whilst ignoring the “real issues” that matter
to the average American. Ultimately, he sees this mentality as more
dangerous to America than anything the Russians might do, a new
departure in US politics of any colour.
Trump knows that Americans want action. Politics is talk, but bombing
terrorists is action. In fact he has recently alienated the US Army
brass by saying that the Geneva Convention is a “problem” which
prevents the US doing what it wants (
This raises questions about his Constitutional fitness to be
Commander-in-Chief, which raises interesting questions about whether
the courts would intervene if he were elected.
Trump regards Putin’s involvement in Syria as the sort of forthright
anti-terrorist action he wants to take himself, and derides his own
country for turning stable countries into hotbeds of terrorism. Forget
about politics, and the multitude of civil issues which need to be
handled at any given time by any given politician:in the eyes of
Trump, if you fight fire with fire, and enlist all the tough guys you
can to support you, America becomes great again. That is, in essence,
the entire foreign policy of Donald Trump.
But this attitude is not confined to foreign affairs. He maintains
that foreigners aren’t welcome in the US because they are potential
terrorists, and so are all welfare claimants because they aren’t
making millions like good Americans should. Trump himself is of
immigrant descent, as are nearly all American citizens, and has filed
for bankruptcy four times, making him less financially viable than a
welfare claimant. But none of this matters if he is tougher than the
next guy, even though others have to do the dirty work for him.
In Trump’s world order Russia will be expected to take a tougher line
against international terrorism to make Trump look better. It will
earn international brownie points by doing so, and be given a free
hand to pursue its every ambition as long as it calls it “fighting
terrorism.” This free hand is what the US itself has demanded for so
long, while trying to dress it up in other terms. A Trump presidency
would end Russian resistance to this by buying it off with the same
Not As Good As It Looks
In such a scenario, America’s long sponsorship of terrorism will be
one of the casualties of the ongoing international revolt against the
political class. Not a bad thing, most would agree. But what will it
be replaced with? Ongoing attempts to call everyone a terrorist in
order to perpetuate a culture of celebrity designed to prevent
Americans addressing the very “real issues” Trump says he wants the
politicians to?
Celebrities such as Trump are treated as untouchable superheroes. As
such, they relate to great historical figures whose reputation has put
them in the same category. Trump would doubtless like to bracket
himself with one such figure in particular; Richard the Lionheart, the
legendary English king who spent all his time engaged in brilliant
combat for Christendom in the Holy Land during the Crusades, the stuff
of poems and ballads and the ideal of chivalry.
Richard the Lionheart avoided his own country as much as possible and
used it purely as a cash cow, practically ruining it in the process.
He was also several things his own people found unacceptable – an
admitted homosexual and, very probably, unable to speak any English,
as a Norman Frenchman. That is precisely why he has become a great
hero – if you look at him and his reign from any other angle, he
appears so negatively that there is little else to say about him.
Donald Trump sees Vladimir Putin as his ally in creating a ruinous
world for the sake of his own glory. Much of his country is giving him
that opportunity, through its own inherent weakness. It is true that
Russia has much to gain from jumping on this bandwagon in the
short-term – but Russia is not America. Putin can play Trump for a
long time, but he too will ultimately have to get back to the real
business before it’s too late, as will the American people.

Icelandic Justice and Criminal Bankers
Column: Society
Region: Europe
On September 15, 2008, a former Goldman Sachs chairman, US Treasury
Secretary Henry Paulsen, deliberately triggered a predictable global
financial meltdown when he decided to break precedent and let Lehman
Bros, the fourth-largest Wall Street investment bank, go bankrupt. The
reasons for his decision are for another time. The fallout from that
traumatic financial crisis remains very much with the world financial
system to this day, more than seven years later. One of the
little-noticed casualties of that Lehman Bros. debacle was the worst
banking crisis in the history of one of the world’s smallest
countries, Iceland. How that country of 323,000 citizens chose to deal
with the crisis is a model for the rest of the world. Instead of
beatifying the criminal bankers responsible for worst world financial
crisis in history, the people of Iceland did something quite
Iceland, a beautiful Nordic island in the far North Atlantic between
Greenland and Norway, with active volcanoes, streams with some of the
most delicious non-industrial and non-GMO wild salmon, self-sufficient
in energy from thermal springs and hydroelectric power, got lured into
the mad, greed-driven frenzy of the US sub-prime real estate crisis in
a big way. In October 2008, amid the global financial Tsunami
triggered by Paulsen’s Lehman act, the Iceland government nationalized
the three largest private banks, Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing,
following depositor panic withdrawals. The three banks, in a few short
years after they were privatized had managed to amass debts ten times
Iceland’s annual DGP.
When a group of sensible US economists proposed Paulsen nationalize
the top Wall Street banks behind the crisis–JP Morgan Chase,
Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs– to restore order and keep
credit flowing to the real economy, he replied that would be
“socialism. We don’t do that in America.” Instead, Paulsen’s US
Treasury used hundreds of billions of US taxpayer dollars to buy
non-voting shares of the Wall Street banks, meaning the Government
didn’t demand any say in the banks’ policies in return. That might be
called bankers’ socialism–privatize the profits and socialize the
By November 2008 the UK and Dutch investors in a now-defunct savings
scheme of Landsbanki, Icesave, found their hundreds of millions of
Pounds of investments were, indeed, frozen like ice—their savings were
frozen ice. When the British government demanded of the Iceland
government the repayment of the deposits in the UK branches of the
formerly private Landsbanki bank, an international dispute, known as
the Icesave dispute, erupted. The British government invoked
anti-terrorism legislation against Iceland in order to freeze the
UK-based assets of Kaupthing, Iceland’s biggest bank, bankrupting the
bank. Iceland’s government turned to the IMF for a $5 billion bailout,
the first European country since Italy in 1976 to do so.
Citizen revolt
The Governor of the Iceland Central Bank, David Oddsson went against
the government of Geir Haarde, who had been complicit in facilitating
the private bankers’s criminal Ponzi schemes, and stated on national
TV, “Icelanders will not pay the debts of profligate financiers (
).”  In January 2009 Haarde’s coalition was forced to resign following
massive protests as unemployment soared from 1% before the crisis to
over 9% in months. The IMF, as always, was demanding severe Greek-like
austerity from the government as condition for its bailout. In
September 2010, Haarde became the first Icelandic minister to be
indicted for misconduct in office, and the only politician in the
world to be charged with responsibility for the financial crisis. He
stood trial before a special court for official offenses, the
Landsdómur. He was convicted on one count.
The Haarde government had twice negotiated terms under which Iceland
would repay the UK and the Netherlands governments, with interest, for
the cost of bailing out Icesave savers. The IMF demanded it as
condition for its money. And Parliament bowed. But Iceland’s staunchly
independent voters twice passed popular referenda rejecting the UK,
Dutch and IMF demands. Under the IMF austerity program, until it was
ended in 2011, Iceland went into an economic depression. Disposable
income fell by a quarter, and 30,000 people – one-tenth of the
population – went into serious loan default; thousands of homes were
repossessed ( In April, 2013, 38-year-old Prime Minister, Sigmundur Davíð
Gunnlaugsson, was elected on promises of mortgage relief for every
homeowner instead of relief for foreign bank bondholders in Iceland’s
three failed banks. His government left international bondholders and
depositors out in the cold, as his government and Icelandic bank
administrators froze some 9 billion Pound sterling in foreign assets
the three banks held at the time of nationalization (
The new Finance Minister imposed a 39% tax on Icelanders wanting to
invest money abroad, as well as imposing capital controls, a move that
stabilized the currency. Most tellingly, the government prioritized
saving its people and economy and prosecuting and even jailing the
private bankers and politicians responsible for the crisis, a
180-degree contrast to the US or EU where governments used taxpayer
money to bail out the criminal banks responsible for the fraud in the
first place.
Jail the corrupt bankers!
On November 15, 2015, Iceland courts convicted the 26th banker
involved in the scandal that burst in September 2008. The bankers who
have gone to prison were charged with crimes ranging from insider
trading to fraud, money laundering, misleading markets, breach of
fiduciary duties, lying to the authorities, market manipulation to
embezzlement. Combined, the 26 jailed bankers will serve some 74 years
behind bars. As well, to date criminal fines totaling $212 billion
have been imposed on the 20 biggest banks. More bankers await trial (
By contrast, at the failed British HBOS bank group, the largest UK
mortgage lending bank, taxpayers were forced to make a $29 billion
taxpayer bailout. The UK Financial Services Authority’s only
enforcement was against the head of corporate lending who was fined
£500,000 and banned from the financial services industry, and loss,
(the dishonor!) of knighthood for one HBOS director. In the failed
Royal Bank of Scotland, also bailed out by taxpayers billions, Fred
Goodwin, the head of Royal Bank of Scotland also lost his knighthood.
He had been knighted in 2004 for awarded in 2004 for “services to
banking.” In the USA, not even a whisper of criminal charges against
the CEOs or directors of JP Morgan Chase or Goldman Sachs or Citigroup
has been heard. Government fines against various banks are written off
and the same criminals that Iceland put behind bars are left free.
The Iceland difference
Today Iceland is the successful model for the precise opposite of the
IMF Greece model of squeezing blood from a stone with brutal
austerity. It is the first and so far only European country to surpass
the 2007 pre-crisis economic levels. GDP grew for the first six months
of 2015 at an impressive 5.6%. Inflation went from 18% at the start of
the 2008 crisis to 2% by 2015. National debt went from 88% of GDP in
2010 to 81%, below most EU levels. In March 2015, the government of
Iceland officially withdrew its earlier candidacy to join the European
Union, the only country ever to do so.
Paradoxically, Prime-Minister Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson was caught
in the middle of the Panama Papers scandal and was forced to resign
due to the fact that he didn’t disclose all the financial assets that
were in his possession. His was the only Western politician who was
directly mentioned in those papers, which seems odd at best. However,
Iceland is still reluctant to back down.
Iceland’s President, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, explained the feelings of
his countrymen: “We were wise enough not to follow the traditional
prevailing orthodoxies of the Western financial world in the last 30
years. We introduced currency controls, we let the banks fail, we
provided support for the poor, and we didn’t introduce austerity
measures like you’re seeing in Europe. Why are the banks considered to
be the holy churches of the modern economy? Why are private banks not
like airlines and telecommunication companies and allowed to go
bankrupt if they have been run in an irresponsible way? The theory
that you have to bail out banks is a theory that you allow bankers
enjoy for their own profit, their success, and then let ordinary
people bear their failure through taxes and austerity (
). “

There appears to be a multi country effort to (re)build gold backed

China Embraces Gold In Advance Of Post-Dollar Era
Tyler Durden's picture
Submitted by Tyler Durden on 04/16/2016 20:50 -0400
Submitted by Koos Jansen via AllChinaReview.com,
To challenge the US dollar hegemony and increase its power in the
global realm of finance, China has a potent gold strategy. Whilst the
State Council is preparing itself for the inevitable decay of the
current international monetary system, it has firmly embraced gold in
its economy. With a staggering pace the government has developed the
Chinese domestic gold market, stimulated private gold accumulation and
increased its official gold reserves in order to ensure financial
stability and support the internationalisation of the renminbi.
    “The outbreak of the crisis and its spillover to the entire world
reflect the inherent vulnerabilities and systemic risks in the
existing international monetary system…. The desirable goal of
reforming the international monetary system, therefore, is to create
an international reserve currency that is disconnected from individual
nations and is able to remain stable in the long run…”
    Quote from Governor of the PBOC Zhou Xiaochuan 2009.
In the present zeitgeist we find ourselves on the verge of a shift in
the global monetary order. The shocks through the financial complex in
2008 that reaffirmed the innate fragility of the US dollar as the
world reserve currency have sparked China to become a vocal proponent
of de-Americanization, although its end goal is communicated less
clearly. Being the second largest economy of the world but relatively
in arrears regarding physical gold reserves, China has a strong motive
to surreptitiously work on its gold program until completion. For, if
it would be candid in its gold ambitions, the price would
significantly run higher, potentially disturbing financial markets and
narrowing its window of opportunity to prepare for the next phase.
State Council Rapidly Developed Domestic Gold Market And Stimulated
Private Hoarding
China has been infatuated with gold for thousands of years. In the
mainland, gold mining and use can be traced back to at least 4,000
years ago, and the metal has always represented economic strength and
was regarded as the emperors’ symbol of power. Although the Communist
Party of China captured the monopoly in gold trade and heavily
restricted private gold possession since 1949, in lockstep with the
gradual liberalisation and the ascend of the Chinese economy the state
started to develop the domestic gold market in the late seventies,
which accelerated in 2002.
A new page was turned when the Gold Armed Police started operating in
1979, not coincidentally a few years after the US detached its dollar,
the world reserve currency, from gold. This army division was
initially assigned to gold mining exploration and has done so quite
fruitfully. Since 1979, Chinese domestic mining output has grown 2,137
% from an annual 20 tonnes to an estimated 467 tonnes in 2015. In
1982, the first steps were taken in reviving China’s gold retail
channels. For the first time since 1949 people were allowed to buy
jewelry and the China Gold Coin Incorporation started issuing Panda
coins. The Peoples Bank Of China (PBOC) continued to be the primary
gold dealer that fixed the price and controlled all supply flows.
The real reform of the Chinese gold market was implemented on 30
October 2002 by the launch of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, erected to
serve the full liberalisation of the domestic gold market. From that
date the fixing of the gold price in China was transmitted from the
PBOC to the free market. In 2004, the State Council approved gold as
an investment for individuals and the PBOC slowly repelled control
over supply flows. The Chinese gold market fiercely rose from its
ashes. By 2007 the market was functioning as intended when nearly all
gold supply and demand was flowing through the SGE system6. A year
later, in 2008, the Shanghai Futures Exchange launched a gold futures
contract supplementing existing derivatives at the SGE.
The Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE), which is a subsidiary of the PBOC,
is the very core of the Chinese physical gold market. Its
infrastructure provides a single liquid exchange overseen by the
state, granting all participants a trusty venue that can be
efficiently developed and monitored. The mechanics of the Chinese
market incentivise nearly all supply and demand to connect within the
SGE system. As a consequence, by the amount of gold withdrawn from the
vaults of the SGE – data that was published up until December 2015 in
the Chinese Market Data Weekly Reports – we could gauge Chinese
wholesale gold demand.
After the crisis in 2008, it became apparent in the higher echelons of
the Chinese government that the development of the gold market and
private accumulation had to accelerate to protect the Chinese economy
from looming turmoil. Through state owned banks and media wires the
citizenry were stimulated to diversify savings into physical gold.
Currently, at Chinese banks, numerous gold saving programs can be
entered into, or individuals can open an SGE account and purchase gold
directly in the wholesale market.
    “Individual investment demand is an important component of China’s
gold reserve system, …. Practice shows that gold possession by
citizens is an effective supplement to official reserves and is
essential for our national financial security.”
    Quote by the President of the China Gold Association 2012.
When the gold price came down sharply in April 2013, Chinese gold
demand literally exploded as in a once in a lifetime event. In between
22 and 26 April, 117 tonnes of physical gold were withdrawn from the
vaults of the SGE.
China has been a gigantic gold buyer ever since. Withdrawals from the
vaults of the SGE in 2015 accounted for 2,596 tonnes (90 % of global
annual mine output), up from a mere 16 tonnes in 2002. SGE withdrawal
data correlates with elevated gold import by China.
Whilst clearly enjoying their bargain purchases, China has established
a trend of increasingly obfuscating the true size of its gold demand.
Not long ago several reports were released in the mainland that
disclosed total gold demand to be the equivalent to SGE withdrawals.
Since 2012 these reports have been hidden from public eyes and in
January 2016 the SGE ceased publishing withdrawal data10. Although
annual SGE withdrawals have exceeded 2,100 tonnes since 2013, what is
generally publicised as gold demand is roughly half of this, merely
the demand at jewelry shops and banks that excludes direct purchases
from individual and institutional clients at the SGE. As a result, the
global consensus is that Chinese gold demand is approximately 1,000
tonnes a year though in reality it’s twice this volume.
PBOC Accumulating Gold To Support Renminbi Internationalisation
To free itself from US dollar supremacy and force the sequent monetary
system, China’s goal is to internationalise the renminbi. For
achieving its target, gold is identified as the key. It is the
absolute monetary asset to support the renminbi, the dollars’ Achilles
heel and a hedge during monetary stress. Next to the swift progression
in the Chinese private gold market we can observe the PBOC is covertly
buying gold and has launched the Shanghai International Gold Exchange
to prepare renminbi internationalisation.
    “For China the strategic mission of gold lies in the support of
renminbi internationalization, and so let China become a world
economic power…. Gold is both a very honest asset and forms the very
material basis for modern fiat currencies…. Gold is the world’s only
monetary asset that has no counter party risk, and is the only
cross-nation, cross-language … and cross-culture globally recognized
monetary asset.
    That is why in order for gold to fulfill its destined mission, we
must raise our gold holdings a great deal, and do so with a solid
plan. Step one should take us to the 4,000 tonnes mark, more than
Germany and become number two in the world, next, we should increase
step by step towards 8,500 tonnes, more than the US.”
    Quote by the President of the China Gold Association 2014.
Not surprisingly, China’s strategy is everything but linear. Let us
analyse the State Council’s most recent actions with respect to gold
and the internationalisation of the renminbi. In addition to gold
accumulation, the State Council has aimed to kick start renminbi
internationalisation by having it included into the International
Monetary Fund’s (IMF) basket of currencies, the Special Drawing Rights
(SDR), in 2015. For acceptance, the IMF required openness of China’s
international reserves, of which the PBOC hadn’t updated its gold
reserves since 2009. Here we found the PBOC stretched between opposing
forces; it obviously preferred to hoard gold in concealment not to
disturb financial markets, while at the same time it was requested to
open its books. In July 2015 the PBOC decided to revise its official
gold reserves by 604 tonnes to 1,658 tonnes, which was probably not
the whole truth but served both means, as markets barely reacted to
the increment – the gold price has not increased since then – and the
IMF has granted annexation of the renminbi into the SDR.
-How much gold does the PBOC truly hold-? Before we make an estimate
we must first address the question, how and where does the PBOC buy
gold?  --Some analysts assume the PBOC buys gold in the domestic
market at the SGE. According to my research this is not true. My
sources in the bullion industry tell me first hand that the PBOC buys
gold in the international OTC market using Chinese banks as proxies.
And this intelligence fits into the wider analysis, as there are many
reasons why the PBOC would not buy gold through the SGE.--
A rough estimate suggests the PBOC holds nearly 4,000 tonnes in gold
reserves, more than twice the amount they officially disclose. In a
quest for any clues we must visit the heart of the gold wholesale
market. Data by the London Bullion Market Association points out there
have been approximately 1,700 tonnes of monetary gold exported from
London between 2011 and 2015. China’s central bank is the foremost
suspect for these purchases, given its size and motives, and the
tonnage exported from London is consistent with other sources that
state the PBOC has bought roughly 500 tonnes a years since 2009. All
clues together point to the PBOC holding roughly 4,000 tonnes
currently. Although this remains speculation.
--More of China’s gold strategy was revealed by the recent launch of
the Shanghai International Gold Exchange (SGEI) that offers gold
trading in renminbi for clients worldwide, in an attempt by China to
strengthen the internationalisation of the renminbi.--  In itself the
SGEI clearly underlines China’s gold ambitions16, but the punch line
was added with the launch of the Silk Road Gold Fund in 201517. Led by
the SGE(I), the $16 billion fund will boost the gold industry along
the Silk Road and in turn “will facilitate gold purchases for the
central banks of member states to increase their holdings of the
precious metal”, according to the Chinese state press agency Xinhua18.
Not only is China trying to persuade all mining and consumption of
gold along the Silk Road economic project to be settled through the
SGEI in renminbi, additionally the Chinese promote gold as an
essential component of central banks’ international reserves going
--We must conclude that the State Council views gold as part of the
coming international monetary system.--  Why else does it quickly
develop the domestic gold market to be embedded in financial markets,
surreptitiously accumulate vast gold reserves and establish a
framework to boost gold business on the Eurasian continent around the
SGEI?  -In my view, China contributes significant value to its gold
strategy in the shadow of the apparent failure of the current fiat
monetary system. And if true, China’s central bank having nearly 4,000
tonnes of gold is well on its way to introduce the next phase.-

Why China hides their gold reserves?
    Recommend this article:
      Comments: 1 »
China’s main goal is to internationalise yuan (CNY) and add it to the
currency basket of the International Monetary Fund. To succeed China
needed to update both of their currency and gold reserves. Last update
in 2009 put Chinese reserves at 1054 tons.
Speculations about how much gold is held by the People’s Bank of China
(PBC) seem to have no end.  The newest update was quite a shock. It
was stated that reserves amount to 1658 t and not to 3500 t as it was
commonly perceived. Allegedly reserves were growing only by 100 t per
year during last six years.
Publication was pushed by the IMF, but in my opinion the official
numbers are understated by a huge margin. Recently in one of my
interviews I highlighted that it is more than possible that number
given by authorities will be smaller than the true reserves but even I
was surprised with 1600 t levels.
Why Chinese did not publish their true level of reserves?
a) The IMF negotiations.
It has been several years since China and IMF are discussing adding
the yuan to the currency basket. Special Drawing Rights (SDR) is a
portfolio of dollar, euro, pound and yen. For years Americans having
the right to veto blocked any negotiations and changes.
It may be that in exchange for somewhat cosmetic change of the Chinese
gold reserves the US government agreed to smoothly include second
Asian currency to SDR. Still the US dollar is the biggest loser here
and consequently the US.
Around October the news may break that CNY after 5 long years of talks
will be officially added to the currency basket.
b) Currency reserves
Substantial majority of Chinese currency reserves worth 3.7 trillion
USD is held in short-term US government bonds. Informing the markets
that government reserves equal 5000 t rather than 1050 t would raise
question not only about the source of this plentiful stash of gold but
also who doesn’t have it anymore. This second part is very important
here. This uncertainty could push the price of this precious metal up
and distort delicate balance in the foreign exchange markets. Chinese
have big stake here equal to 98,4% of their currency reserves.
c) Importing at Black Friday’s prices… to be continued
Regarding gold reserves of the Peoples Republic, Roland Wand –
chairman of Chinese World Gold Council branch – said that “gold
amounts to 1,6% of Chinese reserves, while the ideal situation would
5%. If China announce today that 5% of currency reserves are in gold
the result would be huge climb of global demand and the price of gold.
This is not in the best interest of our citizens”.
Last but not least, government actively encourage its citizens to
invest their savings in gold.
What are the goals of China?
to PPP China is the number one economy in the world. While in many
aspects international arena still treats them as developing country.
Chinese policy will eye several goals in near future:
a) Internationalisation of yuan to change its stance from being
transactional currency to reserve one. Thanks to that China will paint
more trustworthy picture of itself on the global stage.
b) Preparing ground for solid currency (loosely bound to gold) with
simultaneous transformation of economy – from centrally planned to
free market.
c) Owning substantial currency reserves guarding against results of
bursting speculative bubbles (stocks, real estate) in the local
d) Diversification of dollar reserves into various assets
e) Developing of alternative (not-western) market. New silk road and AAIB.
f) Dethronement of the US as the global hegemony.
Let’s now see how much gold PBC really has.

t. Most of the mines are owned by the state and there is a ban for
gold exports.
Since the announcement of official reserves in 2009, approximately
2200 t of gold had been produced. Share of this amount went through
Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) to individual consumers. What was left
probably resides in PBC’s vaults. Ratio is not yet known.
b) Official imports
Gold is imported to China through SGE and then to the market. Last six
years SGE noted the sell of 7000 t of bullion. It is safe to say that
majority ended up in Chinese hands as it is traditional medium of
amassing wealth. Substantial share was snatched by various funds
wholly owned by the state.
c) Unofficial imports
All gold passing from country A to B is recorded. Exception from the
rule is gold coins bought by central banks and government agencies. As
long as the gold is in coin form there is no available information
about its volumes and flows from one country to another. China is able
to import big volumes of aurum through government agencies and have
this imports hidden from official reports.
Similar situations were described by Jim Rickards in the second part
of his book:
“One of the high level G4S directors (global logistics company) shared
that he himself transported gold to China through mountain massif.
Transport was guarded by People’s Liberation Army supported by armored
vehicles. Gold was in 400 oz “good delivery” ingots used by central
It is very hard to estimate volume of China’s government reserves. One
thing is for sure that 1660 t is too small of a number. According to
different calculations Chinese already accumulated from 4-8 thousand
tons. Some estimates talk about reserves being over 10 thousand tons
but personally I think it is exaggeration.
heard rumors that government is able to import around 500-600 tons of
gold while still having stable gold market. Recent Dutsche Bank report
seem to confirm this data. In general it is very unlikely that
reserves are below 4.5 thousand tons.
The big problem of central bank reports is their lack of
accountability. The bank can say one thing but average investor has no
chances to verify it.
The US claims sine ‘50s that they have 8500 tons of gold. There was no
audit since then. Germany claims 3000 tons but majority is abroad.
This makes it hard to distinguish whether they have the gold or its
‘paper promise of return’.
China is no different. Central bank still holds only 1660 tons even if
another 3000 tons are held by funds controlled by the very bank
itself. Formally everything is square.
China’s gold lets them play a very successful game with the US.
Recently Uncle Sam had to accept the change to SDR basket. Next time
it may be other area of Chinese interest which will be focused, time
will show. On global scale this game is played not only for profit but
rather for control. Control is the biggest prize here.

IMF May Move From D.C. to Beijing, Chief Says
Written by  Alex Newman
IMF May Move From D.C. to Beijing, Chief Says
Days after attending shadowy meetings with top globalists and a member
of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, International
Monetary Fund boss Christine Lagarde (shown) shocked the world by
saying IMF headquarters could someday move from Washington, D.C., to
Beijing. The spectacular statement, which came after her attendance at
the infamous Bilderberg summit and the Rothschild-organized “Inclusive
Capitalism” conference, came amid an ongoing establishment effort to
prepare the world for major economic and political changes in the
coming years.
Contary to the facile observations of "gold analysts" partial to
playing up "East vs West," "BRICs vs. PRICS." type memes, the Lloyds
and China LLC have been deep in conversation - through both pre & post
Mao eras. Just like with Russia, the entire "Chinese Revolutionary"
movement was a construction of WallSt/ThreadneedleSt; there have been
no changes in ownership since that early phase - just shift in tactics
(  ).
The so-called NWO has selected Sinoland as the next repository for
their planetary ambitions. Since Deng Xiaoping, the leadership has
been given a mandate - not exactly from "Heaven," but most certainly
to do "God's Work." And thus, carefully schooled in adopting the most
current western financial techniques, in order that they accumulate
the necessary heft in the financial arena for this changeover to
happen. They have also been intensely schooled in the limits to their
autonomy of action - the current downturn in the economy being
engineered with precision to demonstrate the perils of too much
'independent deviationism.'
There is a degreee of rebelliousness to all of this - the Xi regime is
composed of many layers of wily insiders, including some who are true
Sino-nationalists, aware of who's been messing with them for the past
century. That's what makes things interesting, watching what goes down
in the Middle Kingdom. And totally screws up the "analysis" of faraway
western-based writers who script their stories to silly comicbook
scenarios like BRICS and "death of the dollar."
Price suppression in gold and silver has been dictated by the policies
of those in control of China's financial fortunes for the past 5 years
- in conjunction with their agents of influence in western markets.
When they decide its time to change direction, so to will the POS/POG.
Until then, beware the revisionist dogma of consensus trance "gold
experts" peddling the stories which the puppetmasters use to cover up
their schemings.

Those plucky Icelandics - let's wish them better luck than JFK and

Revenge of the Vikings - Iceland Will Create Its Own Money
Well, they were game enough to jail their bankers; let's see if
they'll get away with this
(Blacklisted News)
The banking elite won't like this one bit
Originally appeared at Blacklisted News
Back in 1914, the Bradbury Pound (
 ) was introduced by
the UK government as an ’emergency measure’ to bolster a failing
It was a huge success. The banking elite were unhappy, however and
panicked – before managing to wrestle control of the money supply
President John F. Kennedy also introduced a similar ‘Greenback’ in
1961, and again, the banking elite were very unhappy about being
pushed out, and losing control of the issuance of money as debt. JFK
did not survive past 1963.
Then there was Muammar al-Gaddafi in Libya who, in 2009 announced a
new gold-backed dinar, issued by Libya’s state-owned public central
bank ( ), and with further plans – negotiating with the other African nations
for the creation of an all-African currency to compete with the Euro
and the Dollar. Gaddafi did not survive past 2011.
Who knew that the revolution would start with those radical Icelanders?
One Frosti Sigurjonsson, a lawmaker from the ruling Progress Party,
issued a report that suggests taking the power to create money away
from commercial banks, and hand it to the central bank and,
ultimately, Parliament.
Can’t see commercial banks in the western world be too happy with
this. They must be contemplating wiping the island nation off the map.
If accepted in the Iceland parliament, the plan would change the game
in a very radical way.
It would be successful too, because there is no bigger scourge on our
economies than commercial banks creating money and then securitizing
and selling off the loans they just created the money (credit) with.
Everyone, with the possible exception of Paul Krugman, understands why
this is a very sound idea. Agence France Presse reports:
Iceland’s government is considering a revolutionary monetary proposal
– removing the power of commercial banks to create money and handing
it to the central bank.
The proposal, which would be a turnaround in the history of modern
finance, was part of a report written by a lawmaker from the ruling
centrist Progress Party, Frosti Sigurjonsson, entitled “A better
monetary system for Iceland”.
    “The findings will be an important contribution to the upcoming
discussion, here and elsewhere, on money creation and monetary
policy,” Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson said.
The report, commissioned by the premier, is aimed at putting an end to
a monetary system in place through a slew of financial crises,
including the latest one in 2008.
According to a study by four central bankers, the country has had
“over 20 instances of financial crises of different types” since 1875,
with “six serious multiple financial crisis episodes occurring every
15 years on average.”
Mr Sigurjonsson said the problem each time arose from ballooning
credit during a strong economic cycle.
He argued the central bank was unable to contain the credit boom,
allowing inflation to rise and sparking exaggerated risk-taking and
speculation, the threat of bank collapse and costly state
In Iceland, as in other modern market economies, the central bank
controls the creation of banknotes and coins but not the creation of
all money, which occurs as soon as a commercial bank offers a line of
credit. The central bank can only try to influence the money supply
with its monetary policy tools.
Under the so-called Sovereign Money proposal, the country’s central
bank would become the only creator of money.
    “Crucially, the power to create money is kept separate from the
power to decide how that new money is used,” Mr Sigurjonsson wrote in
the proposal.
    “As with the state budget, the parliament will debate the
government’s proposal for allocation of new money,” he wrote.
Banks would continue to manage accounts and payments, and would serve
as intermediaries between savers and lenders.
Mr Sigurjonsson, a businessman and economist, was one of the
masterminds behind Iceland’s household debt relief programme launched
in May 2014 and aimed at helping the many Icelanders whose finances
were strangled by inflation-indexed mortgages signed before the 2008
financial crisis.

Exactly. This one time, about 25 years ago, when the latest "global
warming" media scare started, something just got to me, irritated me,
so I started expressing my 'sincere' concern about global cooling each
time "global warming" was raised - e.g. "actually, they firetrucked
up, it's global cooling that's coming". This one time, someone got
really concerned asking "REALLY?!!" and got all worried about global
cooling as I had an internal chuckle whilst maintaining my austere
frown and nodding sagely.
Then this one time, it all changed to "climate change" and I knew we
contrarians were on to something.
Then this one time, a few years ago, a science major said to me words
which rang loud, "the most abundant times we've been able to ascertain
in the Earth's history are when the carbon dioxide levels were 6 times
what they are now, and so for life on this planet the only thing we
have to worry about in the next few million years is a new ice age".
But hey that's probably all bullshit since the TV tells us we're about
to die and the solution is carbon tax.

Me, I just want an uncensored list, where people who go off the rails
occasionally are forgiven and otherwise accommodated, and those who
stay off their derailed one track mind get killfiled so the rest get
on with life.
I always hold that we ought respect the founder's' intentions for any
particular list. Those who wish to host should have an expectation
that if they don't respect the founders' intentions repeatedly, they
will be routed around.
The intention of a group may shift over time too - and seems like some
hold that either the list is getting generally off topic for what it
should be, or that the intention of the list has shifted. It is my
intention to associate with others, both online and offline, who want
to have robust communication (which implies some accommodation and
forgiveness), who want to live freedom of speech and other "human
rights", and who might be competent to inform me personally when I'm
actually off the rails.
Instantiating online forums is relatively low friction and low cost these days.
The email list format is certainly preferable to me over forums and
blogs-with-comments - too much irresistible tendency to
censor^Wmoderate with forums and blogs.
The heady days of the crypto pioneers has transformed a little - we're
more settlers now although there is always room and excitement re the
pioneer. But life changes, history informs us, and right now our world
faces some rather big things - in the 1990s the big thing -was-
pgp/gpg, https, and all the variations and possibilities we could
imagine. Ebay, Amazon and Google seem to have won that game - is
anyone surprised? Now the crypto front is rapidly turning into a mono
culture as per that very poignant recent blog/article that was posted
a few weeks back - so we must bless each other and thank fruck for D J
Bernstein and the next wave of mega corporates who will ride that pony
to their billions. So inspiring, original and pioneering yeah?
At this point in history the global financial and political system
was/ is (or appears to be) on a precipice - some big and bold
geopolitical and financial plays are happening around the world and
there's plenty of turmoil, perhaps more than ever in history (e.g. for
those unaware, two of the BRICS nations are currently experiencing the
American CIAs anal "color revolution" probes - this battle certainly
ain't over yet).
I'm also very interested in private communication, pseudonymous
communication, digital currencies - unfortunately I see no silver
bullets to the real problems we face though.  Human dignity can only
be had by those who stand, who claim their rights rather than beg for
some safety and privileges, who value things beyond self, that part of
humans which strives for something greater than mere physical comfort
and indolence. The happy go yippee hippies are rightly derided when
they transform into 'hip' go yippee yuppies in their beemas or teslas
demanding a sealed road to their fancy new storybook house - this has
happened all up and down the eastern coast of Australia - once
pristine paradisaical surfing shanty nature spots have mostly all
become mini metropolii, supermarkets, parking lots, endless sealed
roads and creeaking mansions. This is really sad. And the Australian
eastern coast is ginormous - a few thousand kilometers.

A Supreme Court precedent, and over 200 people known to have had their
mortgages cancelled (and an unknown number having settled out of court
under non disclosure) are anecdotes, but they are facts, and
therefore, no conspiracy here, just an opportunity for ~10% of
high-doc (normal) mortgagees and 100% of low-doc (high risk)
mortgagees (sample size 500 analysed, over 200 to mortgage
cancellation, PhD thesis guy).
It may be uncomfortable to file an FOI with your bank to obtain their
internal loan assessment form.
It may be mildly interesting to then discover they completely invented
a number of facts on their form.
It may be confronting and upsetting to even consider writing a letter
to the bank demanding an explanation and suggesting you'll take the
matter to court.
There are many ways this article can be described, but conspiracy is
definitely not one that will hold up in this instance.
If there's a general concensus, I'm happy for a
noncypherbutstillpunkpunks list. We certainly owe it to ourselves to
create 'spaces' which we find uplifting and inspiring.

It is certainly natural for humans to associate for mutual benefit.
'limited liability' means that the owners of the company cannot be
personally sued.
An anarchic company only exists by those who freely agree to it, and
someone wanting to attach an individual (legally, financially,
personally) may not have agreed to be part of that company, may
vehemently disagree with "the corporate veil" of protection by "statute
It's a different way of thinking - we are so schooled in current
'realities' (real fictions, or shared common delusions) of "Western
style democratic fascist government".
Your initial wording is fine on the face, but whilst my "aggrieved self"
might be willing to agree to 'court' arbitration, "limited liability
fictional entity" may well not even make sense, and yet in the current
world we are 'bound' by government statutes giving that real protection
to those owners/ directors of that fictional entity.
Revolution arises when too few attempt to stand in peaceful (or other)
political protests, in personal non-compliance (driver licenses, vehicle
rego, paying tax to the war machine, not running off in the army to
shoot brown people) and the situation deteriorates to the point that the
ideological extremists collectively agree that there is no option but
Unfortunately, revolution is the usual way of things, since the majority
are too shit cowardly to rock any boat, even a dinghy cause "gotta go to
the footy this weekend", "gotta pay the mortgage/ car loan", "gotta
live my useless irrelevant life", when deep down it is truly fear,
mostly unacknowledged fear.
As I've said, by the time the ex-convict Aussies wanted more control
from the "Crown", the English monarchy was well and truly on the page -
a genuinely peaceful transition (yes, not for the Aboriginies being
slaughtered since 100 years prior).
Although I prefer revolution to evolution, I do not agree that force has
no place.
Force has different dimensions too - we think superficially about
physical and violent force. But consider that our white Western
oligarch's use the courts to force us to comply with an endless litany
of evil and unfair laws (yes they are backed up by police with guns, but
10,000 people just saying "no" is a challenging number of people to put
in jail in a two month time frame - for not paying tax for example).
There is obvious low hanging fruit - eg. legalising all plants and
substance ingestion by (naturally experimental and contrarian and
rebellious) humans. I heard Portugal became an example of this to a
degree, but perhaps the person saying this to me mixed it up with
Sorry, in most cases today, it is government legislation/ statutes/
protectionism which causes the problem.
For example, try establishing a minimum cost wireless internet access
provision 'FM enterprise' - even Google is having trouble against the
telecomms giants, and Google has plenty of money for lawyers.
One has to go -really- grass roots to avoid the despotism of government
- neighbour to neighbour/ N2N community mesh networks may be possible to
do in the face of corporations and governments (who naturally oppose and
gang up together).
Regarding "private" networking, I have seen no comms protocol research
showing that you can achieve anonymity in the face of the global
passive/active adversary (GPA), which we know the western "5 eyes"
governments and spy agencies are.
Longer term, we need our own physical N2N mesh network.

syndicates per se, but the anti-competitive, protectionist rackets
called "statute laws", which are lobbied for and abused by, these
existing mega syndicates.
In the democratic fascist model we see dominant today around the world,
the mega syndicates lobby 'governments' for special privileges - e.g.:
 - the right to tax humans driving on public roads (please, if anyone
   wants to debate this, start a separate thread)
 - the right to compel corporations and owner-operator individual
   'business persons' to sink inhuman amounts of fiat dollars into
   licensed superannuation funds
 - the right to use the courts to punish anyone trying to compete with
   your overpriced, poorly serviced telecomms network (wired or
   wireless)
 - etc etc
And so we see endless protectionist rackets, in every field of human
endeavour, all around the world, under the pretense of being
Oh, and by the way, when I use the term "right" above, I use it in the
sense of "predatorial right" (in case it weren't obvious).
at some levels, or in some cases, yes
BUT, not in all cases!
That is a part of the brainwashing - oh "they" are all so powerful,
there's nothing "we" can do without being shot.
(I know that's not exactly what you said - point is, we have to bust our
programming if we are to have any hope of making collective progress in
useful directions.)
I disagree..
..political anarchy is much more than a critique - it suggests
principles for principled ways for us to interact with one another,
regardless of domain of activity.
Sure. But not one of the definitions you've suggested is particularly
useful - add to that list "direct democracy" - perhaps not the best
definition, but one I saw once and got an "ahah" moment.
Perhaps "opt-in direct democracy" would be a better way to define
"political anarchy" so that lay-persons can grok the concept, rather
than get caught up in the common meaning of 'anarchy == chaos'.
And those units, however they each choose to operate, may syndicate as
a syndicate of units.
And those syndications of units may syndicate ...
And, it certainly does not have to be a pyramid - whichever unit, at
whichever level (individual human, or a greater syndication of some
sort), can choose to be part of/ syndicate with, any other unit of their
choice, for whatever broad or limited purposes they choose...
Why limit the concept?
I'm not quite understanding what you're saying here. It sounds like you
are speaking from a "we need a traditional 'democratic state'" concept,
just without realising it...
I could agree that our tendency to not only speak, but to think in our
'traditional western schooled concepts' is a hard habit to break :)
Watch my lips carefully, as I'm only going to do this once:
   I
   don't
   need
   to model or otherwise do
   shit
   !
Got it?
It's a simple concept. In fact, it is foundational to political anarchy
theory, from my very limited understanding.
Ok, statement of a potential problem clarifies your point. It is good to
clarify potential problems.
But, step 1 is to:
 - clear our heads of our existing schooling/ concepts/ think
 - refrain (!!) from putting words in the mouths of another
 - regrain from telling others what they 'need' to do
Yes, we Westerners are so very very schooled, from childhood by our
parents, and onwards, and so breaking these old communication patterns
won't be easy.
But we have to start....
There are too many assumptions in your above stated problem, and so at
the moment I suggest tidying up our languaging (I'm no exception either)
so that when we state a perceived problem, we at least do so using terms
concepts and assumptions we can agree on.
It is much more than semantic - history shows us many examples of
"bloody revolution", with vast millions of humans ending up dead in the
process of "transition".
A new syndicate does not start out "dominant". I guess you mean "new,
soon to be dominant syndicate".
And that's why the banks (the oligarchs) have funded all sides of every
war in history - very profitable business, war.
So before going to war, ask yourself if you are selling your soul to the
existing syndicates...
I am consistently reacting to what I am hearing from you as a fatalism,
that "new syndicates" are already dominant before they even topple the
existing syndicate, does not make sense.
And I don't think in history it has generally been black and white (new
vs old syndicate) either - the banks (old syndicates) funding both sides
is the kind of 'armed revolution' we usually see in history...
My reaction is because you seem to deny (by assumption in the words you
choose) these possibilities, for just some examples:
 - a new syndicate can start small, probably --should-- start small!
 - a new syndicate can be organically built.
 - a new syndicate might be just two women starting a computer repair
   "shop"
 - a new small syndicate, if it genuinely represents an improvement over
   the status quo (Uber), ought naturally grow into a large syndicate
Catering for likely contingencies is sensible.
I'm pretty sure the USD is gonna go down hard, and then the existing
oligarchs will go into looting overdrive - those who've positioned
themselves to be able to, of course.
Such is the sad state of human affairs we usually see.
It is all very well to start at the end goal, but not at a fatalistic
"guaranteed" bad outcome - if that's all you envision, either get
another vision, or start at the other end of the scale (how we can
usefully form small syndicates, from 2 humans upwards, to work towards a
possible better future).
I will -not- accept your fatalism and your presumed horrific outcomes.
I will -not- accept that there are no pathways to productively and
usefully evolve towards political anarchy in broad action.
Sounds great.
Sounds grand.
Sounds like there are possibilities for action by individuals and small
syndicates that could arise from this viewpoint. I think this could be
Sure, ACK. "We" the human race, need to, must do better.
Great chatting :)

It does sound like the obvious is being missed - so entangled photon
paris can be created, and we can know at one end, if the photon at the
other end is "read", and this apparently happens at at a minimum of
Surely, one could simply create a suitably large number of entangled
photon pairs, as an array, and then read them, or not read them, at the
end you want to "send" information from, and "detect" (so this weird
quantum mechanics story goes) those reads at the other end.
Read + Not read = 1 bit.
What seems to be implied in the stories so far is that the information
must be transmitted through changing states of a single entangled photon
- which assumption makes no sense at all. There's a purported phenomena,
use it!
What are we missing here?

And if you 'observe' at the other side, you can determine that the first

A qwantoom of information, shall we call that?
Point is, one of the purported benefits to crypto is that if one side
snoops (makes that all important 'observation') - or in fact any
untoward interloper goes on a 'snooping' spree (i.e. snoops at least
once), then the other side can determine that the entangled quantum
state(s) has/have been snooped,
as distinct from 'having not been snooped/ observed'.
This sounds suspiciously, distinctly, kinda may be just like a sorta you
know should probably be, "bit" of information (since the first side
created the entangled photon(s), and when that first side later does
his own observation, he can determine if the remote side has had an
observation "done" on it or not.
(Given we now speak Kib, Gib, KiB, GiB etc, should we also speak of
"bib"s instead of "bit"s? You know, "a bib is either 0 or 1, but in base
2 instead of in base 10. That would make a world of difference......)
By simple logic, we have transmission of some information.
Now I say, just like the speed of sound used to be considered "the
absolute upper physical limit of the speed of travel", I suspect that
soon the God almighty "physics" is going to be speaking more commonly
("tis broadly accepted that...") of some sub space, hyper space, super
mega space or twisted entagled N-dimensional space, through which this
"information" travels, and that "of course" and "we really should have
known all along" and all the rest of the "I'm so firetrucking brilliant
[[in hindsight]]" bullshit artist crowd...
In the meantime, either one side (does not have to be "either side") is
either able to determine that the other side made an observation of the
entangled photon,
or not.
Let's not keep going around in circles, and await someone who has
devoted some recent brain photonic activity to the problem, to such an
extent that they be able to explain to us mere mortals WTF we are
"missing", if indeed we are - I'm hopeful yet that we're not, and a
whole bunch of 'very intellineffectuals' start spouting on about "how
great FTL communication is and how obvious it was in hindsight to array
a series of entangled photons to be the entanglede photonic baseband
inteestellar FTL comms platform, like duh!"
Alas, I am confident I am nowhere near as brainy as some other not so
dumn trucks.

I'll accept the clock synchronisation not being possible FTL, but not
the communication part.
The reason being, that the remote side makes an observation, and
although the entangled photon state change shall be observable at a FTL
time-delta into the future for the other side, the other side cannot
know when to make his observation in order to "read" the bit.
And, the side receiving information can only synchronize according to
the most accurate clock he has at his disposal - which runs at most, at
the speed of light, so he cannot make more than some very large number
of observations --below-- the speed of light, and so i.e. his
observational capacity exists as -slower- than the speed of light.
Thus the basic limitation.
Firstly, I suspect the Chinese (and Google who bought the bullshit on
that "quantum computer" company a year ago) have jumped the gun, as we
are missing at least a second superluminal communication primitive. This
point should be obvious.
A full (e.g. FTL) comms circuit requires a minimum of two primitives,
and at the moment all the quantum boffins have is a single possibly FTL
"primitive" (that is, the purported capacity to read one half of an
entangled photon).
And this, with being not able to determine that you changed the state
(not sure on this assumption), and being not able to determine the
state; "at your end".
"At the other end" however, apparently, the corresponding read action
can be done (but without synchronization yet, we don't have such a
primitive, yet), to determine IF the first side has already performed
its own read/observation action, up to and including the same point in
time as we are doing our read/observation - i.e. "now".
But not into the future (presumably, hey wtf do I know).
So, some yet to be properly modelled substrata of the entangled quantum
universe apparently provides for 'instantaneous' communication, given
the following caveats:
 1 - the time synchronization limits of the two sides
 2 - the source/originating 'observation action' must happen no later
     than the time that the destination/receiving side makes their
     observation (should be obvious)
Physics vs engineering? As in, the physicists are so focussed on the
single qubit, they forgot to state "the obvious"?
I suspect that the physicists and quantum mathematicians may have simply
failed to state the limitations of their new toy in a simple way. May be
they did, I have not read any literature and am dependent on this thread
and possibly a pop sci article some years back.

I believe this statement was quite ambiguous, and should have been
written by my ever so humble self as follows:
   -  so entangled photon pairs can be created, and we can know at one
      end, if the photon at the other end has been "read"
note the "has been" replacing "is"!  With, of course, "has been" meaning
"happened at a time up to and including --now--".
Cute concept :)
Possibly a good analogy, but I ain't Schroedinghy, so dunno how
analogous it is :)
Absolutely, in this example case, but I have no idea if your idea is
suitably analogous or not sorry.
If it is actually instantaneous, then the rate is infinite, in the
dimensions in which we make our observations.
If a second primitive is ever theorized and later experimentally shown
to exist, then I am confident we shall see a flurry of mathematical
modelling and comparison and elimination, and something "conclusive" and
"well duh" paraded around.
Your experiment shows possibly that we simply do not understand either
the entangled experiment, or why it cannot be used to transmit
information "simultaneously", since synchronization can indeed happen in
wall clock time, as long as the two ends are far enough apart - e.g. 1
light year, or 1 light minute apart.
No, the statement is: either the remote side can determine that I have
made an observation or not - this is a basic premise, which is either
true or not.
If it's not true, we do not understand this new toy called quantum
entanglement, and therefore cannot reason about the problems nor
theorize as to why it cannot be used for information transmission.
Not in your hypothetical.
It certainly would be - although you cannot verify nor decrypt the
transmission for 1 year, you can prove the transmission actually
happened 1 year ago.
We seem to be missing some vital part of the problem, I guess...

Seriously, I am none the wiser and cannot yet make sense of what they
are saying.
China apparently is putting this experiment in space - are they winning
a game on prediction of one particular bit with > 75% probability, and
if so, can they run that game numerous times to get that probability
close to 100%, and if so, can the random inputs to each side be made not
random so that the result of the game is transmission of information?
I cannot begin to answer any of these questions sorry...
That sounds much more interesting than the implications of 'dull'
said to be arising from qubits :)
The hope is that since some say the experiment is pretty dull to begin
with, then perhaps there is a soul alive who could answer the above
questions... we can only hope.

So it seems to me that information is in fact being transmitted. So I
can freely philosophize and hopythesize in science fantasy, soon to
become science fact :)
I consider that the wave function of the photon, although centred at the
"geometric center" of the photon, is in fact continuous, and for all
intents and purposes, affecting one point of the wave (say 40,000 km
away), affects the photon at the other end of that wave.
Next question, can they truly isolate the two entangled photonic wave
parts? (Not sure if the question makes sense.)

- we need a storage primitive and it seems we have one:

- we are breaking the diffraction limit:

- light/ photons may be individually controllable:
New form of light promises boost for photonic computing
- more control of light:
New ‘microlens’ could lead to ultra-powerful satellite cameras and
night-vision devices
- matter on the way to being created from light, star trek transporter
  eat your heart out:

- optical antennas harnessing the wave side of photons:
Optical antenna may allow LEDs to replace lasers in host of devices

But, apparently, they can predict what the other will see with > 85%
accuracy, whilst theory says they should only be able to do so with 75%
So, each side tests their respective entangled photon (85% certainty of
what the other side saw), then does it all again (another 85%), giving:
85% + 85% = 169% probability that each will "guess" what the other side
saw! That sounds pretty close to certainty to me...
PS: I'm sure someone can do the math better than I... but hopefully you
get the idea - each side "simultaneously" 'observes' their 'half' of an
entangled photon pair, say each second, and use these to reduce the
uncertainty, thereby reaching "1 bit" of information transfer...

@_subject: [WAR] The ministry of truth: NATO liberation of Libya, 2011 
If the following were not true, we'd be incredulous that someone would
propose such an unbelievable and lame movie plot.
Sadly, this is what North America and NATO stand for.
I Thought NATO “Liberated” Libya in 2011?
“Operation Unified Protector is one of the most successful in NATO’s
history… We have done this together for the people of Libya, so they can
take their future firmly and safely into their own hands. Libyans have
now liberated their country. And they have transformed the region. This
is their victory” - Former NATO Secretary General, Anders Fogh
Rasmussen, speaking in October, 2011.
“In Libya, the death of Muammar al-Qaddafi showed that our role in
protecting the Libyan people, and helping them break free from a tyrant,
was the right thing to do” – US President, Barack Obama, speakingin
October, 2011.
“I am proud to stand here on the soil of a free Tripoli and on behalf of
the American people I congratulate Libya. This is Libya’s moment, this
is Libya’s victory, the future belongs to you” – Former US Secretary of
State and Democratic Nominee for President, Hillary Clinton, speaking in
October, 2011.
On August the 1st, US warplanes bombed Islamic State (IS/ISIS/ISIL)
targets in the Libyan city of Sirte, almost exactly five years after
Western imperialists declared NATO’s 2011 war in Libya a complete
These strikes are not the first conducted by the US in Libya this year,
in a broader campaign that is officially aimed at defeating an enemy
that the US had a major hand in creating in the first place (I’m sure
the military-industrial complex isn’t complaining however).
Peter Cook, the Pentagon’s Press Secretary, said in a statement released
on the 1st of August in relation to the strikes that:
“Today, at the request of the Libyan Government of National Accord
(GNA), the United States military conducted precision air strikes [which
is Orwellian/Pentagon-speak for dropping bombs (not uncommonly on
civilians)] against ISIL targets in Sirte, Libya, to support
GNA-affiliated forces seeking to defeat ISIL in its primary stronghold
in Libya… The U.S. stands with the international community in supporting
the GNA as it strives to restore stability and security to Libya.”
Wait a minute though, have I missed something? I thought Libya was
“liberated” in 2011 and the country is now a beacon of ‘freedom and
democracy’ for the Middle East and North Africa? Are the Libyan people
not enjoying being “free from a tyrant;” similar to the liberty the
Syrian people will experience if Assad the ‘tyrant’ is overthrown and
the country is handed over to al-Qaeda?
Since the future belonged to the Libyan people in 2011, is the country
not a vibrant and prosperous democracy today? Is Libya not one of the
major hubs of the Mediterranean, with trade booming and flocks of
tourists travelling from across the world to sample the delights of the
country – from the fascinating culture of the indigenous people to the
stunning (I must admit) Roman ruins?
I thought the standard of living for the average Libyan was much higher
than it was before the tyrant was deposed? Is Libya not helping to build
the African continent up to try and alleviate the millions of people who
live in poverty?
I thought the “most successful” campaign in NATO’s history meant that
terrorism could not gain a foothold in the country, considering the
Western alliance spends the majority of its time (after antagonising
Russia that is) talking about fighting terrorism? I thought NATO’s
love-bombs only hit the baddies, and never killed or maimed any
Are the Libyan people not enjoying the fruits of another Western foreign
policy success story? Are the Libyan people not enjoying the stability
that always follows a Western war of aggression? I thought the Libyan
“kinetic military action” was yet another triumphant imperial endeavour,
just like Afghanistan, Iraq and the numerous other countries that were
lucky to be the targets of Western ‘humanitarian’ forces?

** Hillary Clinton blacks-out during speech, attention focused on her true health [Video] (
By Alex Christoforou on Aug 09, 2016 01:53 pm
EMBARGOED UNTIL 0001GMT ON WEDNESDAY, JUNE 19, 2013 Wikileaks founder Julian Assange speaks to the media inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 14, 2013, ahead of the first anniversary of his arrival there on June 19, 2012. A year after seeking refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, Julian Assange remains fearful of US "revenge" over the WikiLeaks disclosures and aware that the diplomatic deadlock over his case may continue for months, if not years. AFP PHOTO/POOL/ANTHONY DEVLIN (Photo credit should read Anthony Devlin/AFP/Getty Images)
Last month at the DNC, Wikileaks unleashed a cache of emails that showed the Democratic party and Hillary Clinton had conspired to rig the primary elections ( against Bernie Sanders.
Assange also released, to much less publicity, 1,700 emails that showed Hillary Clinton ( was directly involved in the destabilisation of Libya and Syria, and knowingly funneled weapons to Al Qaeda and ISIS.
The Clinton campaign diverted all of America’s attention away from what should of been a massive scandal (with charges of treason levied on Hillary Clinton) by simply conjuring up the spectre of Russian aggression and Vladimir Putin. America fell for it and the media promoted the Clinton diversion tactic as they were instructed to do.
As teflon Hillary continues to run amok, above any law, doing anything she pleases, Assange’s Wikileaks has promised another tranche of emails that will further expose Clinton’s massive corruption, and appetite for all out war.
The Democratic party will risk no more Wikileaks’s induced speed bumps, in the coronation process of the first woman president, and the establishment’s ultimate insider war hawk.
That is why reports out of Ecuador are now pointing to increased pressure on the Ecuador government to remove Assange’s asylum status, and finally expel him from the Ecuador embassy, and into UK police custody…where American authorities wait patently to lock Assange up for life, never to be heard from again.
Hillary can then smoothly move on to becoming the next US President, as was planned nearly two years ago.
Ecuador govt under serious pressure to censor Assange over  ( & criticism of Clinton  & — WikiLeaks ( August 8, 2016 (
Media in Ecuador is now calling for Assange’s asylum status to be reconsidered. ElComercio.com had this to say ( …
In this context, it happens that the author of the mess is none other than the person to whom Ecuador has granted asylum and protection to for more than four years. I was the first to say that Assange has, like all other human beings, inalienable rights, that must be respected. However, an asylum seeker also has obligations that cannot be ignored. He should not “perform acts that disturb the public peace, or to participate and influence political activities” and he also must respect and not harm, with his actions, the country that decided to give him asylum.
Unfortunately, Ecuador has not set a limit to the conduct of Assange, and has allowed him to violate his asylum status, and taunt those who seek asylum. His latest interference in US politics could have worldwide consequences, of which Ecuador, Assange’s protector, will not leave unscathed. If London has refused to closer ties with Ecuador, because of Assange, then Washington is expected to react in the same way. And the United States is our best commercial partner!
I said that, once granted asylum, Ecuador is bound to honor it. However, given the gruesome performance by Assange, he undoubtedly violates his refugee status, and it should be considered whether this conduct, taken to such extremes, is a good reason for Ecuador to end the asylum.

** Iran’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad demands Barack Obama ‘pay another $2 billion’ (
By Alex Christoforou on Aug 08, 2016 10:33 pm
As Obama tries to explain away the $400 million ( he [DEL: airlifted :DEL] paid to Iran last week in return for hostages ( , or in line with a a Hague Court agreement (whichever one you are more inclined to believe), former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is figuring that while Obama has his hands in his pockets, might as well ask for a little more.
In this case Ahmadinejad is advising US President Barack Obama to return $2 billion seized from Iran in order to help ease a “bitter past”.
The letter was delivered to the White House through the Swiss embassy in Tehran, which represents US diplomatic interests in Iran.
It urges Obama to “quickly fix” the issue surrounding frozen Iranian assets.
The letter begins with the traditional Islamic greeting “As-salamun alaykum,” and was released by the Dolate-Bahar (  website, which is run by Ahmadinejad’s supporters.
Former Iranian president Ahmadinejad advises  ( Obama in a letter published on a website run by his supporters: pic.twitter.com/MO44luDVNV (
— Bozorgmehr Sharafedi ( August 8, 2016 (
In an open letter addressed to the POTUS, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gets straight to the point…
“You took office as the president of the United States amidst a climax in global frustration…following several decades of hegemonic policies and behavior of consecutive US administrations.”
“Your campaign slogan was ‘change’ and you claimed to be determined to change those policies as well as behaviors.”
“On June 9, 2014, a court in America, based on unfounded claims without presenting any reliable documents, issued a sentence based on which about two billion Dollars of the Iranian nation’s assets would be seized unlawfully.”
Ahmadinejad further wrote in the letter that Obama’s promise to restore ties with Tehran has never been fulfilled, “and the same hostile policies along with the same trend of enmity were pursued, in alternative ways.”
Iran believed a “compensation for the past would have been remedied” during Obama’s terms.
RT reports further ( …
In April, the US Supreme Court ruled that Iranian assets worth $2 billion must be paid to American families whose relatives were killed in the Beirut and Saudi Arabia military attacks blamed on Iran, which took place in 1983 and 1996, respectively.
Notably, the ruling came despite an apparent easing of tensions between Tehran and the West, and the lifting of most sanctions following a nuclear deal framework agreement.
Iran responded angrily at the time, calling the move a “highway robbery” and “property seizure.” In mid-June, it was revealed that Tehran had filed a lawsuit against Washington to the UN International Court of Justice.
People in Iran hope “that the particular case of property seizure, which fully occurred during your term in office, and actually toward the end of the term, and which is counter to all international legal principles and rules, be quickly fixed by your excellency,” Ahmadinejad wrote.
Ahmadinejad said the letter “is by no means of political nature.”
The former Iranian President mention years of “oppression and cruelty by different American governments” against Iran.
Ahmadinejad the goes on to advise Obama to not let the moment go to waste, and wishes him well, as his letter concludes….
“I passionately advise you not to let the historical defamation and bitter incident be recorded under your name.”
“Best wishes for the health and well-being of all nations.”

@_subject: [MONEY] Behind Closed Doors at the IMF 
The following provides a plain english note on a couple of foundations
of the IMF which some may not have grokked before (SDRs will cause/ be
blamed for future inflation ('through the back door')), although it
ultimately devolves into a book advertisement (which I guess may be of
interest anyway considering the topic).
Its structure is mildly deceptive - the author ought to have (in my
world shatteringly high opinion) been upfront that his article arises
from a new book he is hawking.
Behind Closed Doors at the IMF
By Jim Rickards, Strategist, Strategic Intelligence
The Washington, DC, area is thick with secret agencies with ‘three-letter names’, such as CIA, FBI, NSA and less well-known outfits such as the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).
One of the most powerful, and also most secretive, of these agencies is an institution that is not even part of the US government. It’s an autonomous part of an emerging scheme of global governance accountable only to a small elite of central bankers, finance ministers and heads of state. That institution is the International Monetary Fund, or the IMF.
Everything about the IMF is designed to deceive you — beginning with the name. The IMF is not really a ‘fund’ in the sense of an endowment or mutual fund; it functions as the central bank of the world, taking deposits, called ‘borrowings’, from countries around the world and making loans to its members.
It prints money like most central banks, but this world money has the opaque name of special drawing right, or SDR.
Now, when I say world money, it sounds kind of spooky or scary, but special drawing right is a funny name. The global financial elites pick strange names for what they’re doing so people don’t understand what it is. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) can print these SDRs.
They have in the past — there’s nothing new about it. SDRs were created in 1969, and hundreds of billions of them have been issued over the years. But the IMF only issues them when there’s a financial panic. They don’t issue them every day or when times are good.
You will not be able to use them, touch them or feel them. You will not be able to spend them. You will not have them. SDRs are not going to be walking-around money. You’ll still have dollars, but the dollars will be a local currency, not a global reserve currency.
So for example, when I go to Turkey, I cash in some US dollars and get some Turkish lira. I use the lira to pay for taxis in Turkey. Then when I leave, I cash them out again. That will be how the US dollar is used. You’ll use the US dollar when you come to the United States, but it’ll be like the Aussie dollar: something you use when you go there.
The dollar won’t be the important global reserve currency. The SDR will be used for the settlement of the balance of payments between countries, the price of oil and perhaps the financial statements of the 100 largest global corporations. The impact on everyday investors will be inflationary.
The difference, however, is that, right now, if we have inflation, everyone blames the Fed. In the future, however, you’ll have inflation coming from SDRs. That means when people try to blame the Fed, the Fed will say it’s not us; it’s those guys over there on G Street in Northwest Washington. Go blame them. No one even knows where the IMF is. So the SDR is just a way to get inflation through the back door.
The IMF has a convoluted governance structure in which the highest decision-making body, the Board of Governors, has little power because the votes are weighted in favour of the largest economies, such as the US. Actual power rests with the blandly named International Monetary and Financial Committee, the IMFC.
Everything about the IMF is designed to make it difficult for outsiders like you to have any idea what is going on.
The insiders like that arrangement just fine.
Given this culture and history, it was surprising to see the publication a few years back of a book by Liaquat Ahamed, Money and Tough Love — On Tour With the IMF . The book is the most detailed account yet from behind the scenes at IMF headquarters.
The author also reports on an IMF annual meeting in Tokyo and goes on the road with IMF ‘missions’ as they monitor large and small governments around the world. These missions are the key to forcing governments to conform to the ‘rules of the game’ as established by the global monetary elites.
Ahamed had difficulty getting the cooperation of the IMF and access to IMF meetings and missions he needed to write the book. In the opening section, he writes, he soon discovers that gaining access to the world behind its doors will not be easy. The fund is the repository of many secrets, which it guards ferociously. It does its work behind the scenes, out of the public eye, and has a history of being wary of the press… The fund benefits from a certain mystique that could be lost by too much openness.
In the end, Ahamed was granted access by IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde. What follows is a revealing account that is part history, part economics and part James Bond as Ahamed travels from Washington to Tokyo, Dublin, and Maputo, Mozambique. He describes IMF interactions with other members of the global power elite, as well as the IMF’s member countries in both the developed world and among the poorest.
Importantly, the book is highly accessible. Ahamed avoids the arcane jargon that fills most accounts of the IMF as well as the IMF’s official publications and reports. Anyone with the slightest interest in the workings of the international monetary system will find this book an excellent guide to how the IMF goes about its business on a day-to-day basis, and how the IMF has the power to make or break sovereign governments by deciding whether or not to make loans when those governments are in financial distress.
One of the book’s main takeaways is the demonstration that the IMF is just as powerful as the military and CIA when it comes to forcing regime change in governments that do not follow US orders. Of course, the IMF does this without firing a shot. They use money as a weapon just as effectively as the military uses special operations or the CIA uses drones.
Second, if Western nations lose votes in the IMF and those votes are given to communist China, then the IMF money weapons may be aimed at the US in the future.
In recent decades, the emerging markets and southern Europe have needed IMF bailouts. In the future, the US may be the one that needs to be bailed out, and we may have to accept conditions imposed by China using the IMF as its monetary agent.
The book is also timely. While the IMF has always been opaque, its importance to global finance has waxed and waned over the decades. Now the IMF is about to enter its most powerful stage yet.
Central banks bailed out the world in 2008. The next financial panic will be bigger than the ability of central banks to put out the fire. At that point, the only source of global liquidity will be the IMF itself.
The issuance of five trillion SDRs, equal to US$7.5 trillion, to paper over the next financial panic will be highly inflationary. The difference between this coming inflation and those in the past is that few investors will know where the inflation is coming from.
Politically, it will not be easy to hold the US Treasury or the Federal Reserve accountable, because they will just point a finger at the IMF.
The one true advantage of SDRs is that very few people understand them, and there’s no political accountability.
Understanding the financial world’s fire department before the next great fire will give you an advantage when it comes.

Democratic strategist, CNN Host, former Fox News Host, and Hillary
Clinton supporter Bob Beckel…
has figured out how to deal with the Julian Assange thorn, that is in
Clinton’s side…

Julian Assange’s latest revelation that has Bob Beckel calling for his
assassination…the DNC email hack (that the Clinton machine cleverly
diverted into a Putin-Trump imaginary bromance) was most likely leaked,
not by Russians, but by 27 year old Democratic staffer Seth Rich
, who was mysteriously (and conveniently) murdered right after the DNC
Here is what Bob Beckel said…
“The way to deal with this is pretty simple. We’ve got special-op
I mean — A dead man can’t leak stuff.
This guy’s a traitor, a treasonous — and — and he — he has broken every
law of the United States, The guy ought to be — and I am not for the
death penalty, so if I am not for the death penalty, their is only one
way to do it…
Illegally shoot the son of a bitch.”
What if a Trump surrogate or supporter had said this, or something
remotely like this?

@_subject: tapping the libre world - USA steams ahead of Russia 
A very rare instance where the USA government is taking the initiative,
in positive way, rather than just bombing and droning people to death on
a daily basis.
Russia legislated to "preference domestic software" in comparison.
As most around here know, free-libre open source software, when even
marginally funded, has an almost certain chance to dominate its sector
or niche over any and all proprietary alternatives, at least over the
medium term.
This means that the USA government, and any companies building on
government-funded libre source code, are likely to have a competitive
edge over those companies and governments that do not build such a
community ecosystem. It's a simple matter of the mathematical and human
dynamics in play with libre software.
On the libre front, Red Hat is unimpeachable, absolutely impeccable
record for sticking to libre principles, and they maintain a very
enviable position in the software services market.
Yes Red Hat had a first mover advantage (Cygnus), but the point is, they
can never be unfairly challenged on their fundamental competitive edge -
libre software; at most competitors can compete and target particular
sectors and offer "better" service to potential customers, but no one
can ever be more competitive on the fundamental software front, since
libre open source software IS a level playing field.
The Russian PostgreSQL services company thread we saw here a few months
ago is a great example - they are building a lead in Russia which will
become unassailable in the way that Red Hat is unassailable.
And in both cases, rightly so, and righteously so!
(I even tried to use RedHat for a few weeks some years back, to see if
it would be appealing to me, but alas my Debian muscle memory wracked my
soul in an irrevocable death grip of libre file locations and command
There are other examples tor too - it is difficult
to challenge hegemony, much more so a libre community-oriented "fully
open source, man" hegemony :/

** CNN host Don Lemon destroyed by Secret Service agent over Donald
Trump’s 2nd amendment speech [Video]
By Alex Christoforou on Aug 11, 2016 06:16 pm
Donald Trump says Barack Obama is the “founder of ISIS” and ‘Crooked’
Hillary Clinton is the “co-founder” [Video]
While very few people in the media or in government would ever say such
a thing, Donald Trump did say it, and he is correct in a certain way.
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, through their actions in Libya and
Syria, gave birth and funded ISIS, until the group they once called
“moderate rebels” took a life of it’s own, and violently turned on its
western masters.
Zerohedge reports
that Trump is focusing in on the Obama-Clinton foreign policy mess, that
is the middle east:
Obama “founded” ISIS, a statement that has already incited angry
rebuttals from the media even if it confirms what a secret Pentagon
report revealed
last May according to which ISIS was created by the US as a “tool to
overthrow the Syrian president.”
“ISIS is honoring President Obama,” he said during a rally in Fort
Lauderdale, adding that “He is the founder of ISIS. He founded ISIS.”
He did not spare Hillary either: “I would say the co-founder would be
‘Crooked’ Hillary Clinton,” Trump added of his Democratic rival.
Trump criticized Obama’s decision to withdraw U.S. military forces from
the Middle East and leaving behind a void ISIS could fill.
“We should never have gotten out the way we got out,” he said. “We
unleashed terrible fury all over the Middle East.” Alternatively, one
can argue that the US should have never gotten in but that debate is
beyond the scope of this post.
“Instead of allowing some small forces behind to maybe, just maybe, keep
it under control, we pulled it out,” the GOP’s presidential nominee
“Then Obama came in, and normally you want to clean up and he made a
bigger mess. We’re not respected. We’re laughed at all over the world.”
Trump made similar comments last week, when he called Clinton the
“founder of ISIS” and said “she should get an award from them.”

‘ Investors are buying bonds for capital appreciation and stocks for
income. The world has turned upside down… It is a poison brew that
central banks keep serving us. ’

— Financial Times , 11 August 2016
In the blind pursuit of making debt cheaper to keep the debt-dependent
economic growth model in motion, central banks appear to have forgotten
Merton’s Law of unintended consequences.
Actions always have reactions.
With negative interest rates, governments, and some high quality
corporates, are now being paid to borrow money. This is plain dumb. But
that’s the upside-down world we currently inhabit.
I say ‘currently’, as it defies logic to think negative rates are a
lasting phenomenon.
Best guess is that it’s going to be one of those periods economic
historians will file away under ‘insanity’, ‘desperation’ or ‘what the
hell were they thinking back then?’
While some say economic pundits believe negative rates can become a
permanent fixture, the logic fails the ‘smell test’.
According to a September 2015 IMF paper titled ‘A Strategy for Resolving
Europe’s Problem Loans’:
‘ European banks face significant challenges from their high levels of
impaired assets. The global financial crisis and subsequent recession
have left many countries with elevated levels of nonperforming loans
(NPLs). NPLs in the European Union (EU) stood at about €1 trillion (or
over 9 percent of the region’s GDP) at end-2014, more than double the
level in 2009. ’
Given the plight of Italian banks, it’s not a stretch to think the
amount of non-performing loans in Europe could be even higher these
This is the definition from Investopedia of a non-performing loan:
‘ A non-performing loan (NPL) is the sum of borrowed money upon which
the debtor has not made their scheduled payments for at least 90 days. A
non-performing loan is either in default or close to being in default. ’
In the old days, we called these ‘bad debts’.
But in this upside-down world, calling things as they are is a definite
Why have non-performing loans doubled since 2009 (especially when
interest rates — the cost of money — have been falling)?
Sorry, I can’t call it as it is. The official spin goes something along
the lines of ‘sluggish growth’.
To put €1 trillion into perspective, it is roughly $1.5 trillion…which
is pretty much the size of the Australian economy.
How did all these loans become non-performing?
Underlying economic activity did not produce sufficient revenues to
fulfil loan obligations. You lose your job, or have your income reduced,
or your business turnover slumps (deflates)…then you go to your bank and
tell the [him/her/transgender/cross-dresser] bank manager ‘you’re up
s**t creek without a paddle.’
90 days later, you are a non-performing loan statistics. Welcome to the
The bank is in a bind. Recovering its money is not that easy. The
security offered is worth far less than the loan. Not only that, but if
all banks started selling the assets behind the distressed loans, asset
prices would be driven even lower. So the non-performing loans sit on
the books…waiting.
Waiting for what? Economic growth. When the elusive growth does
eventually appear, it’ll pick up revenues — incomes rise, profits
increase, outstanding loan commitments can be repaid. The ‘non’ can be
dropped, and performing loans become the order of the day.
Call me silly, but for growth to make a sudden and lasting appearance on
the economic stage, I’d have thought providing people with an income to
spend would’ve been somewhat crucial to that outcome. As I said, ‘call
me silly’.
And that’s where the quotes and headlines at the start feed into this
perplexing story.
The traditional bastion of secure income used to be the fixed interest
bond…backed by ratings agency credit scores like AAA, AA+ and so on.
Pension funds — with obligations to pay employee pensions for decades to
come — have traditionally invested in high quality bonds to provide a
portion of the return required to meet those ‘written in stone’
obligations. Tens of millions of people are relying on their pension
fund to come good with the promised payment each and every month during
their retirement.
To meet these obligations, the pension funds have two options available
— firstly, to generate a rate of return on current assets and/or
secondly, where those returns fall short of the projected level, the
employer is required to make up the shortfall.
This sounds simple enough, but with millions of fund members having
varying life expectancies and differing pension entitlements, this
creates a mathematical nightmare…especially with medical science
increasing our life spans with every passing decade AND central banks
decreasing the rates of return on offer from the traditional safe haven
investment used by pension funds.
Which is why headlines like this…
‘US faces ‘disastrous’ US$3.4tn pension funding hole - Collective
deficit of retirement plans is three times larger than official figures’
— Financial Times , 10 April, 2016
…and commentary like this…
‘ Many well-known companies, including BT Group [British Telecom] , the
telecoms company, and energy businesses Royal Dutch Shell and BP, have
pension deficits that run into the billions, according to LCP, the
pensions consultancy.’ — Financial Times , 3 January, 2016
…are finding their way into mainstream reporting.
Pension funds (the primary source of retirement income for tens of
millions of baby boomers) are woefully underfunded. The prospect of
having the money available to meet these obligations grows dimmer each
Depending upon which report you read, the average pension fund, to
fulfil its obligations, needs a return of between 5% and 8% PER ANNUM —
that’s each and every year.
Government bonds paying MINUS rates of return obviously make achieving
that projected return that much harder. Hence the headline — ‘Fears
mount for pensions as gilt [UK government bond] yields touch negative
So where do pension funds go to achieve the desired rate of return?
Shares, hedge funds, junk bonds, and private equity funds.
Given that each of these investment categories has a history of
shredding investor capital, there’s the very real prospect that pension
funds could find themselves sliding further down the greasy ‘rate of
return’ pole…making their task of paying the promised pensions even
The central banks have indeed served up a poisoned brew .
With millions and millions of boomer retirees faced with the prospect of
lower retirement incomes, there’s no way the much sought-after economic
growth is ever going to be realised.
Non-performing loans are going to fester on the banks’ books until the
open sore can no longer be covered up with Band-Aid measures.
Failing banks will then need to be bailed out by shareholder capital,
bond holders and depositors…all this shreds more investor capital.
The negative loop means pension funds then lose even more money on their
bank shares, bond holdings and cash deposits. Pension payments are
cut...and we repeat the exercise.
This upside-down world has sent a lot of blood rushing to the head of
central bankers, denying them the ability to think and act with any
Which is why I think, after the next credit crisis, we’ll see some sort
of permanent ‘helicopter money’ program introduced.
More unintended consequences are definitely in our future.

** German President Joachim Gauck says “elites are not the problem,

Germany Sochi Boycott
It is an unbelievable statement, but also a very revealing statement
that shows just how arrogant and untouchable the Brussels elite ruling
class believe they have become.
In much the same fashion as teflon Hillary Clinton in the United States,
the German political class is also under the impression that they are
the chosen rulers of a peasant population that simply does not
appreciate their benevolence and kindness to the sheeple masses.
In a recent TV interview, German President Joachim Gauck said…
“The elites are not the problem, the people are the problem.”
Germans did not take kindly to the President’s statements, and let him
have it with boos and spit.
The anger that is building up all over the western world towards the
global elites is breath taking. It is only a matter of time anger spills
over into blood and revolution. Zerohedge reports
Official German State TV and State Radio reported that “a handful of
right wing extremists” have attacked the president and disturbed the
otherwise peaceful and welcoming reception of the President. This is
simply not the case, as seen in the video…
The people repeatedly shouted “Traitor!”, “Get out!”, “We don’t want
STASI Pigs” and “We are the people!”.
One man, carrying his young son on his shoulders, appears to have spit
on him whilst exclaiming insults. Other citizens were heard saying “You
killed our children” and “What have you done to us?”. They were blocked
by police in riot gear, to whom they said “You are protecting
warmongers, shame on you!”
The situation escalated and the riot police was forced to use pepper
Heiko Maas, the German Justice Minister, called the attackers “cowards
who insult the president because of their personal frustration”. He
himself was booed off the stage as a traitor by hundreds of Germans at
the annual Labor Day celebration on the 1st of May. He said that they
will be persecuted immediately, as “it cannot be allowed that such a
tiny minority has influence on the political climate in Germany”.
Germany, the stalwart of the EU, is a social mess. Financially, Deutsche
Bank is a house of cards. Europe be warned, the “tiny minority” is
sending a message which the political class chooses to simply ignore.

war brewing over Crimea
** Ron Paul says ‘CIA involved’ in government overthrow in Ukraine, war
brewing over Crimea (VIDEO)
By Vladimir Rodzianko on Aug 14, 2016 11:16 am
As Ron Paul and Daniel McAdams correctly point out, the whole crisis
originates from the U.S. backed overthrow of Viktor Yanukovych in 2014 ,
Ukraine’s constitutional and democratically elected President. The U.S.
backed regime that seized power in Ukraine as a result of this coup has
pursued a militantly anti-Russian line, provoking the secession of
Crimea and Russia’s actions there. Though this has created a crisis on
Russia’s border in an area where the U.S. has no direct interest, the
U.S. continues to meddle, fanning tensions and internationalizing the
Russia claims to have stopped a sabotage operation by Ukraine’s
intelligence service. Ukraine denies the charge and has beefed up the
military on its border with Crimea. Is another war brewing? Is the US
pushing for it?
A very important point Ron Paul and Daniel McAdams make is that the
U.S.’s unqualified backing for the Kiev regime simply encourages it to
take the sort of dangerous and reckless actions we have just seen in
Crimea. The result is that every attempt to reduce tensions in the area
– of which there have been many coming from the Russian side – have come
to naught. In Ukraine, as in other places (including Syria – also
touched on by Ron Paul and Daniel McAdams in the video) U.S. policy is
creating problems, not solving them.

want the TL;DR, read the sentence in the last paragraph, which seems

Here is Australia, the Liberal party is the conservative/ less debt/

raises taxes, increases handouts.
Both parties are still well funded by the corporates of course...

A Black Day in Monetary History
By Bill Bonner in Ouzilly, France
Last night, we tossed and turned in bed like a crazy person with a
Sunday was clear and hot. In the evening, we went to the 19 th -century
church in Montmorillon for a concert.
Bach, Schubert, Mozart — all were performed on the big organ in back of
the church, accompanied by a clarinettist.
Fortissimo thunder
The organ is about 30 feet off the ground.
It is set on a wooden platform, ornately carved, and cantilevered out
into the church so that it is over the heads of the people sitting in
the rearmost pews.
It is built of such sturdy, heavy wood that we thought for a moment the
entire ensemble might pitch over onto the crowd below.
That was after all the stops had been pulled out, and a fortissimo
thunder arose from the organ. It sounded like the advance of the Red
Army on Berlin in 1945. (Elizabeth noted that she thought the organist
was abusing the instrument.)
Classical music performed on a huge, old organ in a stone church is
always impressive.
But there were a couple of times when we thought that Bach was just
toying with us…or that he had lost the plot, wandering up and down the
scales with no clear destination.
Our favourite, ‘Concierto de Aranjuez,’ by Rodrigo, haunted our sleep.
It is a piece with an undercurrent of sweet melancholy such as what you
might find echoed in the Diary from time to time.
Yes, we laugh at economists, politicians, and popular myths. But beneath
it — like an unrelenting, dark accompaniment of ‘Concierto de Aranjuez’
— is the age-old lament that everything you care about inevitably comes
to an end.
New monetary era
The musical highlight of the evening was ‘Ave Maria’ by Franz Schubert.
It was, after all, Mary’s big night: the eve of her assumption into
Appropriately uplifting and bright, ‘Ave Maria’ was Schubert’s hit song
of 1825. It was composed as ‘The Lady of the Lake’ and adapted to the
Catholic prayer addressed to the mother of Jesus.
Schubert died three years later at the age of 31.
Returning home after the concert, the moon shone so bright we hardly
needed to turn on the lights. We could see perfectly well, but the
colours were washed out. It was as if everything had been painted in
shades of black and white while we were away.
Maybe it was the moonlight…maybe it was the sad music…something
disturbed our sleep.
We turned to the left. We turned to the right. We heard the melodies
from the concert so clearly, we went to the open, moonlit window to see
if someone were playing a radio outside…
But perhaps it was something else troubling our sleep…
Yes, today, we mark the beginning of a new era…and the end of the
American Dream — such as it was.
On this day in 1971, President Nixon defaulted on America’s promise to
its foreign creditors to convert its dollars to gold at the fixed rate
of $35 an ounce.
This ended the last vestiges of the gold standard. And it set world
currencies — which had been pegged to the gold-backed dollar —
‘floating’ against one another.
Neither Nixon, nor almost anyone else, had a clear idea of what the new
monetary era really meant.
No one — not even economist Milton Friedman, who advised the president —
had any idea what it would do to the world economy and to the American
system of government.
Friedman was right about most things. But he was disastrously wrong
about money.
Yet, so subtle was it…so clever…so unanticipated — like a sudden shift
to a minor scale or an unexpected major lift — it took 40 years for the
new refrain to become clear.
Maculate conception
Only now are we beginning to hear the full melody…and understand how
this new money corrupted the country and undermined its wealth.
For all its faults — and there were many — the US used to be a place
where hard work usually paid off.
People worked, saved, invested…and grew wealthier. Wealth followed work,
not the other way around.
There were always whiners and complainers — some with legitimate beefs
about the way the system worked. Still, there was a shared belief that
the system was fair…because there was a connection — real and
unforgiving — between money and the morality of the marketplace.
Generally, those with money got it by work, invention, innovation,
self-discipline, or luck. And generally, other people accepted the
outcome as fair.
But this new money changed everything. It turned an entire class of
people — the insiders, the elite, the establishment — into parasites
able only to get money unfairly.
The new money was the product of a very maculate conception — borrowed
into existence, not earned.
This put the cart of money manipulation in front of the horse of hard
work and innovation. If you had the right connections, you could conjure
up wealth…from the money itself.
‘ By the sweat of your brow you will earn your bread, ’ it was commanded
in the Bible.
So it had been — with brief interruptions of monetary experiments and
adventures — since the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden.
But now, with this new system created on this day 45 years ago, money is
gotten sweat-free, in the air-conditioned towers of the big banks…
…and used by the ‘Parasitocracy’ to rule the nation.
More to come…

Trying to pin all that on Putin, who is the only man still standing who
stands AGAINST the USA hegemonic evil, is the height of idiocy!

"Eurasion block" countries and "the global south" as Pepe Escobar calls
it - just witness those who tried before Putin tried, to sell their oil
in any currency other than the "almighty" US Dollar:
 - Saddam Hussein started selling oil in Euros (Iraqi president, murdered
   by North American 'elite' forces)
 - Muammar Qaddafi was building an Arab world gold backed "dinar"
   currency, and intended to sell oil in this gold dinar

   oil, ensure French influence in the region, increase Sarkozy’s
   reputation domestically, assert French military power, and to prevent
   Gaddafi’s influence in what is considered “Francophone Africa.”
   Most astounding is the lengthy section delineating the huge threat
   that Gaddafi’s gold and silver reserves, estimated at “143 tons of
   gold, and a similar amount in silver,” posed to the French franc
   (CFA) circulating as a prime African currency.

put it at 2020 at the latest, since by about 2024, the USA government's

@_subject: software - multiple version installs (any distro developers here?) 
Any distro developers here? I just want to float an idea with a couple
folks before throwing it out publicly - I'm sure this has been thunked
before, but I'd like to see the libre unix software ecosystem move
forward on this.
Firstly, witness the glory of /opt :
$ tree /opt -L 3
├── bin
│   ├── eclipse -> ../e/eclipse/eclipse
│   ├── libreoffice -> ../l/libreoffice/program/soffice
│   ├── lo -> libreoffice

└── v
    └── vuze
        ├── 5600
        └── latest -> 5600
So we see this particular /opt/bin is a (admittedly small in my personal
example) symlink farm, pointing out to various versions of various
installed software.
Also, it is structured like a Debian style package pool, with
directories {a..z} to contain the various (manually in this case)
installed software.
With just a smattering of /etc/.. based meta files, .deb meta files and
tool awareness, a distro could install all software in this form - say
into /usr/a/.. /usr/b/.. etc., and /usr/lib, /usr/bin and /usr/share
become symlink farms.
The primary benefits I see are:
 - simple multiple versions install of same software/ library/ etc
 - different software can easily depend on different versions of
   other software/ library/ etc, since everything can easily be parallel
   installed
 - existing Unixy standards can be more easily maintained (/bin /usr
   /lib) with symlink farms
 - end user can much more easily maintain their own custom /opt/bin to
   override version preferences rather than learning arcane per distro
   package incantations
Main problems:
 - it's a partially new install/ FHS system (though a multi-year
   transition shouldn't be particularly painful afaict)
 - really needs to become part of FHS, and therefore cross-distro
 - therefore needs buy-in from >1 distro, or at least a non-intrusive
   transition plan/ capability
Does anyone foresee any other particular problems with this concept?

My question was, is and shall continue to be, who of the various
candidates in the upcoming USA elections, who might get elected to run
the USA war machine, would be the least likely candidate to push Russia
and or China and or the rest of the world into World War 3, when the
economic crunch time for North America finally hits the fan.
We know a massive global financial crash is coming, and in previous
points of financial collapse, history shows us an almost certainty of a
major war following.
This bodes EXTREMELY PRECARIOUSLY for all of us on this little blue
planet, and suggests that those who vote in the upcoming North American
elections ought think carefully about the question above.
Those who are onlookers might consider being in contact with anyone they
know who will be involved/ voting in the upcoming USA elections, and
discover their thoughts on this fundamental question - who is most and
who is least likely to start World War 3.
Also, look into the preference voting system (like we also have in
Australia) if you will be voting, and figure out how your candidate's
votes might be applied to other candidates, should your chosen candidate
not receive enough votes to be elected. That, or choose your own
Be informed, and let's do our bit towards avoiding World War 3 - if this
issue of the potential for the next world war is not handled by us

too late to argue or say sorry or I told you so or anything else so

Awesome! That's exactly what I want.
Except I want Debian to do all that for me.
A major distro heading that way (e.g. Debian) might encourage developers
to increase the configurability of their own software perhaps?
Gotta start the improvement somewhere...
I want to establish, re doing this "at the distro level":
- whether it's a better way
- are their any insurmountable runtime issues
And therefore if it all makes sense, to see if there'd be any buy in
with developers of a particular distro.
Is it generally a better way, say for the large mainstream desktop and
server focused distros?
In what scenarios is installation direct to /usr/[bin|lib|share|...]
actually a distinctly better way?
Ahah! Yes so we need a new default packaging/ installation format to be
supported by RPM and DPKG, to support the better way, e.g.:
How hard can it be to support this more rational approach?
These fundamentals have no reason to change. The "/opt" example was
simply how I am locally using /opt for custom software installs beyond
what debian provides.
Also convenient to use .../{a..z} for my offline "setups" (.tar.gz
downloads), git clones, documentation (books, URLs I save) etc - each of
these {a..z} hierarchies has been inspired primarily by:
 - Debian's package pools
 - Daniel Berstein's "universal program namespace" intention which
   never really took off.

So look into /var/lib/dpkg/info - that's heading for 9K files on my
system - and this is a relatively fresh install (<12months)!
That's not human friendly. Debian's package pools are definitely more
human friendly (says the almighty humble I).
But sure, a flat hierarchy may be more human friendly, still with each
package in its own /usr/program-v0.7.2/... directory, and still having
the usual symlink farms in /usr/bin and /usr/lib etc.
It's probably a bike shed issue - my preference is, given the number of
packages that get installed in "an average desktop installation", to
have an {a..z} layer, as in /usr/{a..z}/program-v0.7.2/...
In agreement on this.
The point is just multiple versions parallel installs, that's all.
This should make a lot of things easier in various ways - Debian
"backports" for example, not only custom end-user installs, besides the
obvious developer test installs - think:
   $ git checkout tag-v-3.7.14
   $ ./configure DEST=/usr/m/my-program-v-3.7.14
   $ make
   $ make install
   $ make symlink-as-primary
Wouldn't you like it to be "GNU/Linux, the hegemonic OS"?
Have you never been frustrated fighting the base package system with
multiple versions of something you want installed?
Tried to install a backports only to end up in a dependency hell where
some backport lib must also be installed, and this stuffs up other
packages from your base install?
Given my experience, your "nobody wants" is too broad by at least 1 :)
Symlink farms to actual per-version install folders would make "alt
'environments' almost trivial to implement with nothing but a change in
PATH and one or two other env vars.
I suspect could be possible to have as a simple plugin/set of rules, for
dpkg, which would not conflict with the existing layout, just supplement
for those who want a "better backports installation ability".
That's the itch that gets me on this one - failed attempts to install
backports packages - along with some successful attempts too - but my
experience is inconsistent, and it is evident the process is more
complex than it needs to be.
I still think the different distros would not share, in general, the
binary packages due to compile flags and preferred versions.
Multi version program installs would apply to any distro.
Yes, a bucket list item for me - my attempt at Red Hat doesn't bode well
though - we are creatures of habit.
Thanks heaps for the feedback.

Vehemently claiming "theory" is not theory and is actually "fact" does
not make said theory, facts, and only serves to highlight the
possibility of "agenda". Now, in your case, the agenda may be nothing
more or less benign than an intention to "waking people up out of
ignorance", but is nevertheless, whatever it is, an agenda (thorougly
guilty of such vehemence myself in my younger years - such as at least 4
months ago...).
Don't mix up "reasonable mathematical model giving weight to a
scientific theory", with "scientific fact". Around these parts (you may
have noticed) you'll keep coming unstuck on that one :)

Assertion != fact.
Scientific theory != fact.
Even, solid mathematical model != fact.
"Science" as some of us prefer to use the term, is where facts, actual
measurable testable facts, are determinable by testing and verifiable by
someone else running the same test and making the same measurement,
resulting in taking/ measuring the same value (same result), thus
verifying said fact as a fact, a value, a measurement, and more than
merely assumption arising from some scientific theory.
Perhaps someone else can try to explain this in a clearer way? Perhaps
it's a difficult thing to express clearly in English..

When we cling to certainties (even "facts" mind you) is it that we
express an attachment which may be causing us to not see something?
How about when we react in an emotional way, to quotes from history's
"great minds", rather than respectfully deconstruct the fundamental
problem which we assert is hidden in that historical quote, or that
definition (e.g. a definition of the word 'science')?
Is a call to non-emotionally consider what is being said, in the
precision of the words being used, a rational, hey even possibly
'scientific' call to the listener/reader?
Could it be that those challenging a dearly held assertion, do so not
from any contrariness, not from any obtuse stubbornness nor even
belligerance, but from a heartfelt desire to seek 'the truth' and to
discover the true facts behind an assertion made by another?
Can we truly say we are engaging in conversation when we presume
stupidity on the part of another, when they ask explicitly or implicitly
for "more data, please"?
Could it be that those asking for "more data" have spent considerable
genuine personal time and energy searching for said data facts in
support of said assertions and "scientific theory parading itself as
scientific fact" and are at the point of frustration and "well, I've
looked, could not find, so bloody well put up or shut up already"???
Is there any possibility that our personal programming be our Western
schooling system is so ingrained, so deep, that parts of it are simply
unseen by our not so humble selves?
And could it be that such deep programming is in fact used by wealthy
oligarchs around the world who meet behind closed doors to discuss and
execute intentions to spin certain stories based on "the glory, power
and untouchable truth of 'science'" to their personal and
group/corporate economic benefit?
And would it be reasonable to say then when such oligarchs have such
meetings and execute such intentions, that they have "conspired"
together to improve their profits and control in the world?
Could the fruits of such endless closed door conspirings be the reason
the "conspiracy theorist" had to be demonised, socially shunned and
turned into the politically incorrect pariah?

I disagree - it's a chaotic system, chaotic as in fractal chaos theory
chaotic, meaning that a small change in one spot can cause a big change
elsewhere, butterfly effect and all that.
So we see whole ocean flows change in a period of 3 years or less, and
the consequence being England goes from quite balmy to ice and snow all
year round, and vice versa.
And, in one person's lifetime.
Long term global weather is a chaotic system.
Long term global anthropogenic temperature effects are currently most
politely described as "scientific theory" - and frankly that's a bit
generous - humans being human and all, mathematical models "attempting
to prove weather science" are not exactly solid beyond a few weeks.
But hey, I'm just a conspiracy theorist, don't mind me :)

I like comedy as much as you, but a joke does not take away from the
principle of a competitive market for systems, over the long term. The
DAO was not a single contract, nor a series of contracts. It was "a
contract in a competitive market for contracts" in the sense that it was
"a decentralised investment fund/ market maker" in the market for
"decentralized investment funds/ market makers".

The Netherlands to close more prisons: Here’s what Australia could learn
Debra Killalea  August 3, 2016
Dutch Prison System: How it works
THE days are filled playing sport, reading, and practising new skills.
There is learning, course work and open communication with support
networks is strongly encouraged.
This may sound like a great place to learn, but this isn’t a university
or school campus.
It’s a prison and this is how the Dutch teach its offenders to keep out
of trouble.
It may sound like a soft touch but with talk of closing prisons, the
Dutch believe they have a lesson to teach the world when it comes to
While some countries struggle with overcrowding in prisons and crime,
the Netherlands intends to close its jails.
In March, the Dutch government revealed it had too many empty cells and
not enough prisoners to fill them.
It announced it was strongly considering closing five prisons, on top of
the 19 they already shut down last year because the national crime rate
continues to fall.
Justice Minister Ard van der Steur told parliament that not only were
judges imposing shorter sentences but criminals were spending less time
in jail.
He also claimed less serious crime was being reported according to The
The Dienst Justitiële Inrichtingen (DJI) Custodial Institutions Agency,
which carries out the sentences, reveals more than 13,000 detainees are
held in the country’s prison system.
This cost the government an estimated 2 billion euro a year.
In an effort to reduce that cost, DIJ treat those undertaking prison
sentences a little differently and focus on rehabilitation rather than
According to a video produced last year by DJI, the philosophy behind
their work involves reversing criminal behaviour and therefore reducing
the risk of reoffending.
It may look like a university dorm, but this is how prisoners live in
the Netherlands. Picture: Youtube/DJI Source:YouTube
This involves an intense program of education, skill sharing and
undertaking courses which will better serve detainees once they are
Detainees also have access to an intensive support network once they are
back in the community.
Juveniles undergo more intensive programs with counselling, education
and parental support all crucial to ensuring as many of the 1600
youngsters in detention remain trouble free.
The crime rate in the Netherlands has decreased by an average of 0.9 per
cent in recent years, Sputnik News reported.
Just like the German system, the focus in the Netherlands is keeping
inmates engaged. Some even have the option of spending weekends at home.
Dutch prisons are full of social workers, mental health professionals
and lawyers.
A 2013 VIJ report revealed the emphasis is on “therapeutic culture” for
enabling inmates to return successfully to society.
In Germany, prison workers receive two years training before being
placed in the system in Germany compared to five weeks in the US state
of Colorado,Next Cityreported.
In both Germany and the Netherlands less than one in 10 convicted
criminal offenders are sent to prison compared to 70 per cent in the US.
AUSTRALIAN PERSPECTIVE
Managing senior lawyer Jimmy Singh told news.com.au he believed we had a
lot to learn from the European approach.
Mr Singh, from Sydney Criminal Lawyers, said Australia had high
recidivism rates and the focus was on locking up offenders rather than
keeping them out of the system.
“NSW has some of the highest recidivism rates in Australia,” he said.
“In NSW 48 per cent of inmates returned to prison within two years.”
Mr Singh said he believed the Dutch and Swedes had it right when it came
to focusing on rehabilitation as recidivism rates were among the lowest
the world.
These cells are not what most of us imagine prison to look like.
Picture: Youtube/DJI Source:YouTube
“Dr Don Weatherburn from the Australian Bureau of Crime Statistics even
said between 2015-16 there was a 12 per cent increase in the prison
population,” he said.
“In Europe the emphasis is on diversion and rehabilitation, here it is
on punishment. I think the Europeans have definitely got it right.
“The statistics speak for themselves.”
He said he believed our tough bail laws and the scrapping of diversion
programs such as the Court Referral of Eligible Defendants Into
Treatment (CREDIT) was partly to blame.
He said sending people to jail didn’t always work especially when a
first-time offender was imprisoned with inmates serving time for much
more serious offences and mental health issues were not addressed.
Writing on the Sydney Criminal lawyers blog, Lawyer and Principal Ugur
Nedim said the Dutch model was so successful even Norway was sending
some of its prisoners there to fill the cells.
He pointed to falling crime rates in nearby Sweden as further proof the
European model worked in reducing crime and reoffending rates.
“Sweden’s prison numbers fell by about 1 per cent per year from 2004 to
2011,” he writes.
“Then, between 2011 and 2012, they declined by 6 per cent.”
He also highlighted a decision by the Swedish Supreme Court in 2011 to
give more lenient sentences for drug offences.
Mr Nedim said this meant inmates spent less time behind bars but also
made it easier for offenders to return to society.

0) The processes and actions done and upheld by those carrying seats
   of power in Tor Inc, with respect to Jacob Applebaum, are abhorrent.
   Justice has been denied to all involved.
   Serious problems have been caused to those who are genuine and or
   potentially genuine victims, and these problems continue to be
   perpetuated by those with authority in Tor Inc.
   Lies and deceptions have been ignored, outright denied, or otherwise
   perpetuated under the aegis of Tor Inc.
   Abhorrent behaviour has been ignored, upheld or indeed to a casual
   observer, have resulted in promotions of authority within Tor Inc.
   All these things are an absolute disgrace and those with authority in
   Tor Inc ought be fundamentally ashamed of the approach you have taken
   and continue to uphold:
      - implicitly,
      - tacitly,
      - and explicitly.
1) Tor is on topic for public consciousness around online privacy,
   anonymity, etc. and your question implies a fundamental missing of
   this fundamental point, and our fundamental needs in a democracy,
   and therefore the significance of that which is occurring at
   Tor Inc and within "the Tor community".
   The available options for those seeking a higher discourse are few
   and far between.
   The significance of the fundamental problems that are occurring as we
   speak, within Tor Inc and the Tor community, is deep, of deep
   concern, and is seen by far more than the mere few who take steps to
   highlight the wrongs and or to improve the situation.
2) Wikileaks is much harder to censor, unlike other recent publications
   e.g. the call for a 24 hour boycott of the Tor network was swiftly
   censored.
   There is an evident campaign to censor genuine and sincere, and
   needed actions and communications in regards to this whole affair.
3) Some of those with power in Tor Inc appear, to some of us in
   "the tor community" as being one or more of the following:
   -  fundamentally compromised ( e.g. lawyer, also "victim", also
      "investigator" - are you absofiretrucking serious??!!!??!! )
   -  covering for other compromised Tor Inc power brokers
   -  tacitly consenting to evidently compromised Tor Inc power
      brokers by ignoring, and or focussing on how to "massage" the
      "public message" so as to "minimize damage" (to what? to Tor Inc?
      What about damage to principles? damage to the community? damage
      to the dreams and intentions of hundreds of unspoken folks who
      gave their good intent, their hearts and often their time and
      money to contribute to the Tor network???)
   -  refusing to call a spade a spade
   -  evidently compromised due to covering for other Tor Inc power
      brokers who have demonstrated fundamental sociopathic and/ or
      highly objectionable actions, behaviour and words
4) Wikileaks has public mindshare and visibility.
5) Getting published on Wikileaks makes it much harder for those who
   want to appear clean-faced (Dingledine etc) to ignore the fundamental
   problems which have happened, are continuing to happen, and are, to
   the eye of this not so humble observer:
      - ethically objectionable,
      - compromised
      - and fundamentally problematic in oh so many ways!!!
Time to grow up folks. Own the damn mess. Clean up your shit. Get rid of
those individuals who are evidently compromised in ways that can not be
Fail to take these steps and you will forever lose your ability to claim
"we did our best" or "we didn't see what we were doing".
If you cannot see, and you refuse to see when the problems are pointed
out, you will have none but yourselves to blame. Many of us are doing
our best to point out fundamental problems, and we get either banned
from the public discussion (Juan, Afalex and others), booted from the
community or Tor Inc (Jacob Applebaum and implicitly quite a number of
others it has turned out - it's all coming out in the wash in that
grande olde thing called the Internet - you might have heard of that?)
or shouted at to "get off the cross, we got work to do".
Yes, you sure do... plenty of work to clean up this mess - continue to
pretend it does not exist at your peril.
By holding yourselves out as a "leading light" of free speech, dissodent
speech, genuine anonymity and or privacy whilst online, and also a
purportedly fundamentally ethical approach to the activities Tor Inc
purports to champion,
   -  you have been,
   -  are,
   -  and shall continue to be,
held to a high standard. This is not your option. Tor Inc is not a
"normal" company - none of you (employees of Tor Inc) are held by us in
the Tor community as "normal" employees or "regular" folks - we have
been, are, and shall continue to hold you to a higher standard than we
hold "normal" capitalist 'pigs' to.
That also means you suffer a far greater disgrace, and far more
publicly, than most other normal people ever would suffer.
And this is simply how it is - it is not something you have any control
over. It is we, the Tor community, who choose how to hold our so called
and purported (even though self elected) "leaders".
You have no choice in the standard we hold you to.
You have no choice in the consequences in our minds and in our hearts
when you fall from the grace we previously assumed you to be in.
You have absolutely no choice in the long term default consequences in
our respective consciousnesses, each of us individually, of how we hold
each and every one of you in the face of your words, your actions, and
your non-actions.
And take good notice - it is perhaps most often your non-actions, which
demonstrate your tacit support for evils done, which have the greatest
consequences in our consciousness.
Meet our (!!) standard and you shall stand as heroes.
Fail to meet our standard and you and your purported principles shall
forever be "the ones who fell from grace, disgraced themselves and
disgraced the community, spitting on the very principles we all held to
be sacred and inviolable".
   Your time is close to running out.
Your sincerely,

Whether it's the DOD or the CIA, some black budget line items, "third
party" "arms length" (but CIA backed) financial contributors, or indeed
perhaps that's why the lead Tor devs get $100K+ salaries - may be off
the books, they're obliged to spend $30K of that on dir auths, exit
nodes, whatever, or any combination of the above,
it's splitting hairs.
The primary funder on the books, from memory, is the DOD.
The primary beneficiary are the CIA crooks who run around the world
attempting to overthrow governments around the world. They get to have a
very fancy and very functional overlay "free speech" network to assist
them with their dirty deeds.
Feel free to split hairs though - that only feeds the genuine concern.

It does come across as "we were the victim", but perhaps was intended as
"here and there, amidst the veritable national crucifixion we (USA)
dished out, those plucky Vietnamese managed to deliver the occasional
successful counter punch, even using scraps from the battlefield (the
bastards), for which we will forever remind them and the world and
anyone who will listen and paint it as Vietnamese military aggression
against the weak US victims".

The principled ones.
In leaked chats etc, they (Tor Inc honchos) keep focussing on "how to
protect the image" and "can we employ this CIA guy without creating a
problem for our reputation".
It reaks of "we don't give a damn about the principles wee proclaim on
our website, Now when volunteers say "enough's enough, I cannot trust you guys, I
thought I could, I'm stopping running my relay", they are getting
blasted - slapped in the face with their own conscience e.g. "how could
you! You are choosing to put peoples lives at risk!" - check it out,
"moral/ emotional blackmail" for want of a term, perhaps "conscience
blackmail" - that only works when the listener is weak, but they keep
trying it on anyway.
That's what sociopath's do - try very hard to hold us to our higher
standard, while they race around fucking everyone over, hoping we don't
see the trick they are using. We go through angst, heartache and
distress over the fallout, the wrongs, the failures, while they try to
abuse us with this very conscience that causes us our pain.
It is evil what they try to do.
Even my gentle reply ("you're slapping a --volunteer-- in the face") has
been censored!
Just check that photo of Shari (-ah law) Steele - she's one tough and
angry looking human, and not in a good way - free of empathy, tons of
ambition and a very harsh approach from what we are seeing. The failures
and outright offensive sequencesing of events surrounding her "Tor

Hello :)
Yes. And in my world, having grown up in Australia with some
non-anglos, and having been quite the outcast throughout my schooling,
I believe I have at least a little awareness of such things. Just last
Sunday, I felt the resigned pain of another, in a face to face
conversation where he said to me "really, thank you very much [for
your compliment], you have no idea how many times I get insulted to my
face here in Australia" (he's been here over 20 years), to which I
responded "sadly, Australians are often [in my opinion] immature and
Also, I strongly object to those who would impose their particular
political ideology on my spare time, on my personal preferences, just
as much as I hope others pull me up from doing so (or implying so)
towards others.
Do you say I am ('morally') allowed to be intolerant of those who are
intolerant of me?
I think we view the see saw of
 a) gradual, pervasive and dominating political correctness on the one hand and
 b) the kick-back by those who feel in this country (and I say rightly
so), the effective violation of our own right to celebrate our own
religion/ holidays/ foods/ etc.
Unfortunately, the collective reaction to "political correctness gone
mad" is sometimes also not "healthy" or "ideal".
I live with a general sense that I am expected to feel guilty or wrong
for wanting certain attributes in a partner, for wanting to enjoy the
fruits of my own activities and labour, that I am supposed to put
every damaged individual and or minority, ON THE PLANET, ahead of my
own needs, my own desires for myself and or my family and or MY tribe
(tribe as I define and choose, of my own desires, my own free will).
It is my right to choose to associate with those whom I choose, those
whom I judge to share my principles, those whom I enjoy the company
Juan and Rayzer go hammer and tong at each other, then turn around and
find consensus (perhaps rarely). I really, really appreciate how
others too on this list, can let it all out, appear to blow their
fuckin tops, then in the next breath be civil and constructive on some
technical or other topic.
WE ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE THIS ENVIRONMENT.
It is our right to stretch our brains, our emotions, our communication
abilities, in these ways, to clash in words. Fuck, it's certainly less
painful than a sword or fist fight.
In this age of technology, creating a "digital community" is a few
clicks away. Lest ANYONE presume to take away our right to sharpen our
collective swords against each other in this tiny (!!) corner of the
digital world - well, be prepared for a juicy and vibrant
digital-verbal crucifixion!
We WILL enjoy our pop corn.
You may well be right. (And I need no ego stroking (yes, I'm guilty of
doing the same).)
I do think we are grappling with a genuinely broad issue in the
Western world today.
The PC (politically correct) position is easy - "inclusiveness",
"tolerance", etc
The hard part is holding ground on the flip side - right to 'racial
strength' (as I define it), individual right to joust, right to choose
my associations and to gather in the face of extremely fascist
post-"9/11" laws which are yet to be significantly implemented against
us, but are wide open doors.
The danger is dumning down ourselves, our conversations, in the name
of "inclusiveness" etc.
"If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything."
Possibly. But here, and I'd really like to see more from others in
this regard, is to unravel the unspoken assumptions.
My words are clumsy, but I'll try naming some assumptions:
- that there are no negatives to the suggestion (classes dedicated to
all foreign students, in all foreign languages, is good/ "critically
or vitally essential" to achieving some "good" outcome)
- ignoring the very real issues with certain cultures and there
tendency to form little tribes (to not "integrate" to use the PC term)
- that foreign students being required to use local language (English
in my country) for all classes is bad
- the foreign language classes are "critical in fostering ... welcome-ness"
- that cultural integration is important, as opposed to understanding
and appreciation and caring and love for, other cultures and their
- more?
Assertions unqualified imply absolutes which are unchallenged.
More precise discourse please.
- "local diversity is great" say you; I can say (per my own youth)
that interaction with those of another culture at a young age -may-
result in greater empathy, but I cannot say this with any certainty...
Tell me, do you say an ethnically/ religiously/ blahly "diverse"
school environment is better than a homogenous environment?
In what ways?
Do you say there could be problems with that?
What sort of problems?
You see, throwing out a bunch of assertions, and hoping some of the
mud sticks, well fuck it, you're asking too much - that's lazy,
wanting others to do all the work of refining your argument/ position/
politics/ intentions.
Don't be so fucking lazy!
ditto - what are the costs? Do you see any costs/ negatives?
It's not "essential" for me to "interact" with or understand anyone
from fucking anywhere, except so far as I have a personal interest or
desire to do so. ALL generalisations are disprovable, except for this
And on the flip side, prove that there is some problem here in cypherpunks land.
Start with a real, actual problem, not a political agenda!
True, I did not.
"My kind of speech" as in bold, attempting to communicate something
currently unspoken, unseen perhaps by many.
Other-cultural awareness ought not require my-culture sacrifice/ dessolution.
Other-sexuality tolerance / inclusiveness must not require
my-sexuality denial and abnegation.
Acceptance of those different to me, must NOT require me to STOP
celebrating who I am, nor to give up MY right to live my rights,
manifest my desires, live MY version of a "happy life".
There are abundant ways to create digital communities that cater to
emotionally weak or hyper sensitive people who may or may not require
professional help, who may well find that the nature of discourse on
cypherpunks (for a random example) is outside their abillity to
tolerate, to accept, to enjoy, to engage in, or even to read.
That is their problem, not ours!
We must not sacrifice our own preference for a spare-time
communication forum - we have a right to what we want too, just as
others have a right to create what they want.
It's been said before in other words: making all forums, all
communities, "homogeneous", destroys the very individuality and
uniqueness that the PC-crowd is wanting "inclusiveness" for in the
first place. That direction is really bloody stupid!
This simple truth, extends to physical communities.

For those who kept their brain cell uninebriated last year and its
synapse firing at least once a day, a few burner addresses got, well,
burned - CIA boys apparently "just havin a bit of fun, don't worry
about it you plebe" - quite the eye opener. Anyway, it's quite clear
they send some folk this way for training. Although this one time, on
cee pee, it seemed like damage control with a covert take down attempt
- can't have those nasty Russians be highlighted in a positive way
now... nasty, nasty, nasty we must believe, like you know, killers and
drunkards, all the way down!
I used to take down, in arguably humorous ways, certain annoying
telephone persons who tended to ring me about some 35 year old debt
they considered important or something. So then this one time, on the
telephone, I realised I was training them, and in that moment I saw
this sad fact, felt a bit depressed and sad about it, so I said to the
lady who'd rang:
"You're new at this [your] company right?"
  ... silence on the other end ...
"You know, your company always sends the new guys to me for training,
but I've had enough of that, now that I realise that's what you're
doing, and I used to have fun with you, but it's not good that I'm
training you because then you'll just be better at being aggressive to
other people you call."
  ... more silence on the other end ...
"So, I'm not going to talk to you people any more."
Finally she speaks up with some indignation "You're not going to talk
to me? But you need to confirm your name and a contact address?!"
I think said "bye" or something before hanging up, can't remember
cause that was a few years ago now.
They stopped ringing me after that.
A moral of the story is actually a bit earlier in history - in that
first moment when I said "FUCK THIS" to the fear inside myself and
confronted the bully at the other end of the phone, and this time I
did it with dignity and simple questions asked back to that bully - I
just didn't fucking care any more, but I was no longer angry either.
The bully hung up the phone on me in less than 2 minutes. Damn that
was a good feeling!  I did not even realise they were about to hang
up, but I sure pulled a surprised yet celebratory fist in the air when
it happened.
    Recommended by Z - "confront the bully"
Had others in stitches after that since I'd go and put these calls on
speaker-phone, hoping that my friends might get some strange ideas
about confronting telephone bullies instead of cowering meekly in fear
and dumping their frustration on me afterwards.
This one time, a particular friend (at the time, sadly no longer) was
really pissed off when his phone rang, so I asked him "is that a debt
collector?" "I think so, they keep fucken ringing too" he replied.
"You want me to get it next time - I'll handle them for you eh?" to
which he agreed, and right on queue, a few minutes later they rang
back again.
So, this particular one went pretty much like this (I first put the
phone into loud speaker mode so everyone could listen in):
me: "Hello?"
Bully: "Is that Name Redacted?"
me: "Who's calling please?"
B: "I need to confirm if that's Name Redacted?"
me: "Sorry, I don't know who you are."
B: "I'm John from Credit Solutions Proprietary Limited, can you please
put Name Redacted on the phone."
me: "Well, ahh ... ... you might be speaking with him now."
B: "Oh, ok, can you please confirm that your family name is Redacted?"
me: "Well I'm not really wanting to do tha..."
B: "THIS is an IMPORTANT business call and I can only speak with Name
Redacted as it's a personal financial matter. Will you please confirm
that you are Name Redacted and also give me your postal address?"
me: "Look, you are wanting information from me."
B: "YES, you need to confirm your name and contact details before we
can proceed."
me: "But I don't really want to proceed."
B: "You are really starting to waste my time! Are you just a joker?!?"
me: "Look, you've haven't caught me at the best time and I just wan..."
B: "OK, I'll call back later, when's a good time to call you back?!"
me: "Oh look, I'd rather get it out of the way now, but I don't know
who you are?"
B: "I TOLD you I'm JOHN from Credit Solutions and I'm in the Customer
Care department - you can speak with my manager if you want to confirm
that I DO work here!"
[At this point I mumbled slightly because I didn't really want him to
hear my next words:]
me: "You don't sound very caring to me."
B: "What was that? You want to speak with my manager?"
me: "No, no, that won't be necessary."
B: "What's your family name?!!"
me: "OK. First, what's -your- family name and postal address?"
B: "I, n.. no, I can't give you that information?"
me: "Hm.  So you can't give me that information."
me: "Why can't you give me that information?"
B: "We have a legal procedure."
me: "Oh."
me: "Ok."
me: "Well, I -guess- I can understand that, since your company has a
duty of care to you guys and all that. I guess we can always serve a
Subpoena on your company if we needed that information."
B: "WHAT?!"
me: "Oh you know, if the police needed some information or something."
B: "Things have always been done this way - it's nothing new you know!"
me: "Yeah, I suspected that."
B: "Anyway, can you please confirm your family name for me?"
me: "Oh no! Sorry. I can't do that!"
[At this point one friend (who's phone I'd answered) is starting to
laugh under his breath, since he could see the last part coming up.
Also, the next few lines are verbatim, and I personally was struggling
to contain my mirth, since the bully at the other end of the phone
STILL did not see it coming, and instead asks me the following
question, point blank, and a little slowly, since I guess for some
strange reason he seems to want to make sure he does not misunderstand
B: "You  can't  confirm  your  name?"
me: "Nope."
B: "Why not?"
me: "I have a legal procedure."
NOW he hangs up the phone.
More laughs than we'd had in a long time. All in a few minutes flat.
(Shared this with many people - hope it wasn't too long for the Internet.)

I like your .sig, but perhaps you haven't figured out, riseup.net is
the establishment's false opposition - "Occupy" bullshit and all that,
used to capture as much rebellious protest energy as possible,
channeling that into the most irrelevant non-directions of ephemeral
bullshit we've ever seen.
Oh yes, the occasional "petition" that begs the government for some
scrap of bread.
Here in Australia, it became clear at some point that Riseup.net was
being driven by Labour ("Democracks"), but for those who haven't yet
figured out the whois command, riseup.net is a product of a
Washingtun, Ewe Ess Eh? company called Riseup Networks.
Had potential. If it weren't the establishment.
If you don't own it, you don't control it.
If you don't control it, it may be used against you.
If you can't trust those who DO control it, it WILL be used against you.

Indeed there are some good folk in riseup, as everywhere. Riseup may
even have a cause which may attain an actual outcome of actual
'improvement' (pick your definition) in the world, notwithstanding the
fundamental undermine and authorities running that particular show.
You trust whom you trust. Your effectiveness in this world is a
product of your ability to assess others, trustworthiness being one
With those I don't know so well, I trust their actions in pursuit of
causes which I am in support of. When their actions are counter to my
concepts of common sense, support for worthy cause, assessment of a
particular cause being worthy etc, my trust in them is reduced,
possibly eliminated - depends how they then respond to certain
questions, their willingness to take on board their own nature
(aggressiveness, apathy etc).
To all, as yourself, I say good luck in this journey called life.

In iceland, some portion of mortgage debts were forgiven also:
"Reports from 2012 (many of which were written by U.S. media outlets)
noted that while Iceland forgave a large amount of mortgage debt in
order to boost the economy's recovery from a financial crisis, this
action did not entail entirely wiping out all home mortgages held by
all citizens of Iceland. Rather, it involved forgiving a portion of
some mortgage debt that was tied to inflation:"

This simply does not follow. Juan made a simple logical response that
"no, just because I choose to drive on a public road, does not mean I
actually agree to display a license plate"
As a fact, Juan's logic is true.
This can also be extended:
- driving on a road does not mean driver -wants- to display a license plate
- driving on a road does not mean driver displays a license plate
(this might result in certain consequences that from various view
points might be desirable, and or un-desirable)
Neither of these two positions, nor the one Juan stated above, warrant
being classified as "a true right wing jackass me-first sovereign
"I don't have to be doing anything wrong to want my privacy."
This one time, an associate was asked by a Magistrate/Judge, "well Mr
Redacted, how would you feel if a driver had no number plate and did a
hit and run on your child?" to which he responded "pretty bloody bad,
and frankly, just as bad as if someone -with- a number plate had done
a hit and run".
The point here is that the number plate does not stop people doing the
wrong thing.
Although there may be some encouragement towards better behaviour by
mandating number plates, such a correlation is not public knowledge,
and more importantly, the costs are manifold:
- our right to travel anonmyously is sacrificed (yes, anonymous wrt
most individuals, but no, not anonymous from the state, which is

It is the bad action which ought be punished/ sanctioned in some way by society.
Razer, your reaction to suggestion that "there is no agreement to
display a number plate when one drives on a public road" is way out of
proportion to the suggestion.
Some people have such reactions because they had a love one who
suffered from some egregious road crime.
Frankly I don't really know what "right winger" means. I really wish I
did, but it's different for different people, so your definition is
unlikely to be useful in this thread.
What I believe -is- useful is to handle a particular issue at a time -
if an issue gets too big, perhaps additional threads are required.
Here you are conflating capability (training) with tracking and
control (license).
And, we can debate whether control via license is abused by the state,
whether control by court order and/ or punishment by the courts for
violations of the public standards/expectations of "the herd", and
compare any purported benefits put forward, with the many costs
involved, some of which I outlined above.
I wholeheartedly disagree with the incredibly simplified assertion
"car bad, state control good".
No. We can not. The lack of depth/ assumption that we can, might be
worth analysing though.

OK, gettin out of the system is good, even if still bound in other
ways. Minimising environment footprint is good. Knowing your rights
and instructing cops as such is also good.
Advocating for good things is good.
Encouraging others to lift their rights/enviro/system/etc game is
good. All good things.
Now living a right can get a bit more difficult - actually driving a
vehicle without a license nor rego plate, and handling the cops and
courts when the time comes.
It's good to raise ones own standards, its a much harder job to raise
the standards for the collective.
Individual right is becoming so suppressed that we in The West need
some serious kick back.

Sounds a good start - you advocate for no birth certificates, marriage
certificates and death certificates then?
In this statement is a subtlety that catches most people:
Regulation of lawful/acceptable behaviour,
 vs
regulation of unlawful/unacceptable behaviour.
Should the state "regulate" sex by issuing Fucking licenses, with RFID
chips to ensure appropriate locations only are used, with
infringements and points loss for excessive fucking or fucking under
the influence (won't someone please think of the foetuses that might
be damaged)?
Next a breeding license, again with penalties for infraction?
Or should "the state" regulate intolerable/unacceptable behaviour such
as rape, when that occurs?
Should the state regulate individual travel by issuing drivers licenses?
Or should the state regulate intolerable/unacceptable road conduct,
when that occurs?
The consequences of one are satisfaction of the expectation of the
herd and curtailing of vigilante justice, the consequences of the
other are ever greater violations of individual rights, freedoms, etc.

Jerzy's comments notwithstanding, I say that you two (rysiek and Juan)
made some great progress in this thread, and I really appreciate the
effort you both put in. Been a bit busy, and so had this thread in my
mind to prod again, since there are some questions raised which are
in, and have been in my mind for some time, so thanks for the efforts.
I'll crop the text down to what interests me personally...
Excellent point. I don't think anyone disputes that Google, Facecrack
and Twatter working with the NSA and CIA is a good thing for us common
And there's an underlying question "in political anarchy, wouldn't
these companies tend to conspire together, against the people, just as
they do now?" Or perhaps "paint me a picture of how these companies
might -actually- be better if political anarchy were our way."
Regarding the OP, waay back, I assume the DMV would not exist, except
for a small percentage of vanity vehicle number plates or perhaps
diplomatic plates etc - there can be no dispute that private sector OR
public sector omnipotent databases will sooner rather than later be
abused against the people.
Juan was not unqualified there - he says that when the money for "the
good" comes from taxation or inflation, that's theft from the people.
I find it hard to disagree that it's theft.
Small point, but this was a searching for shared meaning (excellent
intention btw), and you suggested the second term which you then ask
"why use two terms" - point scoring can be fun, but more important (I
say) that we reach shared meaning/ understanding.
Finding shared meanings can be a great challenge, so I really applaud
the attempt to do so. The process of doing so may involve multiple
attempts, and yes that can look like a One True Scotsman "failure".
Top down: freedom, civil society, anarchy, good
Bottom up: So IWF caused Wikimedia to remove XYZ, is this good or bad;
what principle arises from IWF's action/attack?
It's excellent progress and even thinking about how to define these
terms is interesting, in the face of IWF, WWF, GreenPeace and endless
Juan, your ongoing willingness to jump in boldly, use terms and
attempt definitions etc, is bloody awesome - it's always easy to cut
down the tall poppy and so many don't speak up, remaining meek and
polite and PC all the way to heaven
I found this question quite interesting. But again, we might be back
to definitional road blocks.
Can we say with any certainty that any thesis regarding any political
ideology, can be "shot to pieces"?  The sanskrit-era principle "the
mind is the great trickster" comes to mind.
Definition of corrupt needed here perhaps?
"Can a private company be corrupt without government's help?" is for
me the elephant in the room of political anarchy -> but the question
is too simplistic, since a corporation is an entity created by
sanction and force of the state (copyrights, patents, trademarks,
obligations to pay tax, report finances, etc).
In a political anarchy society, how might a corporation manifest?
Company -> a group or "company" of individuals acting in self interest.
Yes, current large western governments have become pathologically
evil, and perhaps USA is getting close to the "any change is better
than more of the same" point where revolution shakes it all up.
But it's that "acting in self interest" bit which has me thinking ...
Anarchist Google would offer free email right? I still get my free stuff?
That looks like it would be the start of a whole nother, and very
useful, conversation. If power needs to be checked, how is it checked
in an anarchistic society? - (a new thread perhaps)

@_subject: De-dollarization possibly about to snowball 
The article below presents thoughts that seem overly simplistic to me,
being not based much in facts such as the recent awareness that Iran
is now selling its oil in Euros:
(Oh dear, sorry Saddam Hussein, you just weren't a big enough fish,
and you were put in place by the CIA, so you should have been a little
cleverer, or waited 20 years, to sell your oil in Euros.)
and Rupees:
and the consequent rise (last two/three weeks) in the price of gold by
about $150 an ounce - here in Australia, gold normally changes price
inversely to our currency's price wrt USDollar - but last Thursday,
our dollar went UP one cent, and gold ALSO went up (instead of down),
in the order of $100. This is rare.
Yes, when the game shifts, there is a run away from fiat currency into
precious metals, in particular gold. We've seen this historically too
(great depression).
Just because there's not enough gold don't mean a bee's dick of
nothing - that just means that the final fall back currency (gold and
silver) have a run on them and the price skyrockets. Let's see if the
gold price march continues this week and next - if so, it's likely to
skyrocket IMHO ...
Of course we already know that Russia is settling with China in
Yuan/Renminbi, although I don't recall the price of gold going up when
that happened - probably because the USA has had so much pressure on
Russia (Ukraine, sanctions, Syria, media disinfo), but now with India,
and now Iran, and the whole Saudi/shale-oil (and against rest of the
world) price war, well perhaps it's starting to get real enough that
the hedge funds are starting to say "oh shit!"

No, Virginia, Trading Oil in Other Currencies Won't Kill the Dollar
America doesn’t care what color electrons you use
Jacob Dreizin Subscribe to Jacob Dreizin
5 hours ago | 801	Comments
This is the only way to really "kill the dollar." Don't try this at home
There are good reasons for doing certain cross-border trade in your
own currency, or that of your trade partner.
Consider that all digital dollar transactions across borders, anywhere
on this planet, have to go through one or more U.S. banks.
And if Uncle Sam doesn't like you, well, he can just cut you off from that.
No more foreign trade for you!
It happened to Iran in 2012, forcing the country to survive on a
bizarre gas-for-gold scheme with Turkey, complete with a "gold
express" on passenger flights from Dubai to Tehran.
Russia was also threatened with something roughly along these lines in 2014.
Thus, the main benefit of using non-dollar currencies in your foreign
trade:  You're not as vulnerable to the whims of Uncle Sam.
And for countries on the outs with the Uncle, that's very important.
But that's it.
Folks who claim that “de-dollarization” in the oil trade—or any other
trade—will “kill the dollar” (or something like that), don't ever
explain how.
Sure, it sounds good, but what is the mechanism of action?
Answer:  There is none.
Because, today, demand for the dollar isn’t based simply on the
convenience of using it to settle accounts across borders.
Or more precisely, that’s part of it, but by no means the root of it.
The dollar is convenient because every country and major bank has some.
In other words, demand for the dollar is based on its status as the
global reserve currency.
And its status as the global reserve currency is due to the massive,
highly-liquid market for U.S. Treasury bonds.
And the massive, highly-liquid market for U.S. Treasury bonds owes its
existence to:
(1)  The USA's unique position of running perpetual, large,
unrestrained budget deficits, while
(2)  maintaining its ability to pay off the debt issued to cover those
deficits by issuing more debt perpetually, while
(3)  the world needs somewhere to stuff its trillions in cash (to
include trillions of dollars earned by running large, perpetual trade
surpluses with the USA.)  Because, after all, a foreign central bank
holding cash dollars wouldn't be able to pay itself a return, and as
for potential large depositors, your national deposit insurance scheme
only guarantees accounts up to some trivial amount.  Whereas the USA
can print dollars and thus, guarantees all of its bonds.
Does this sound like a confidence scheme?
Hell yeah!
But what are you going to do about it?
That is, if (hypothetically) everyone suddenly lost confidence in the
USA's ability to pay its debts without inordinately debasing its
...Where else could they put their money?
You can't dump those trillions and trillions in your local non-U.S. bank.
No one would guarantee it!
Beyond some token amount, no state can guarantee deposits in a
currency that it can't print itself.
Nor is anyone yet prepared to guarantee the hypothetical equivalent of
those dollars in local currency terms.
Not to mention, the nature of double-entry accounting means banks
would have to immediately loan that money out or put it on deposit
with their Central Bank—which creates its own set of problems.
So all those folks who chant “there will be a run from the dollar”
should think about what they're saying.
Moreover, they should ask themselves:  A "run" into what, exactly?
What would the nations and banks of the world convert their dollar
reserves into?
It can't be “rubles” or “yuan”, because that available volume of
rubles or yuan (not debt instruments, but actual bank money to play
around with) doesn't exist.
The authorities would have to print mountains more rubles or yuan on
the spot, crashing their value (and thus, paradoxically, supporting
the dollar.)
But more to the point in our debt-money system, that volume of ruble
or yuan sovereign debt does not exist.
Hence, saying “there will be a run from the dollar into (blank)”,
ignores the fact that there's not enough (blank.)
Not by a long shot.  Not even if the dollar crashed 50 percent
overnight against every other currency.
But even if there was enough, your money-changer or bond dealer would
have to take those dollars you're handing him, and put them somewhere!
After all, he won't just throw them away.  He has to eat, too.
So where would they go?
Into U.S. bonds!
Thus reinforcing the dollar's status as the global reserve currency!
So as you can see, a cataclysmic “run on the dollar” is impossible
under the current system.
Uncle Sam has this one locked down tight.
As I explained here, it would take a total collapse of global finance
to even begin to get the ball rolling away from dollar hegemony.
And as I also explained here, the pain of such a collapse would be
borne primarily by emerging markets like Russia, China, etc.
And that's the last thing those countries want.
So as long as the dollar remains the world's reserve currency,
“de-dollarization” of the oil trade means nothing to the dollar.
It's certainly a good idea for the countries involved.
But America could care less.

"pro inflation quack" - I like it, very apt.
Let's rewrite "anti inflation quack" to "pro stable money proponent",
or perhaps more likely:
- "pro gold backed currency conspiracy theorist"
- "anti fiat currency revolutionaries"
- "government financial accountability quacks"
- "pro constitution subversives"
or, as we've probably all heard
- "pro constitution terrorists/ extremists"

Allen Baldanza

This is a 9 minute video, although you only have to watch till 7:40 to
get the main argument.
It seems state sovereignty in the EU has become a thing of the past.
Not only does the EU seem to obey every foreign policy decision the US
asks it to, but there are many US citizens, educated in the US, who
have become important members of government in certain states. In the
Baltic States, namely Estonia and Lithuania, even heads of government
were US citizens. Under these heads of government, the Baltic states
had joined both the EU and NATO. Of course, there is also Ukraine,
which, after the coup in 2014, the new government appointed a US
citizen to be finance minister.
Even more striking is these members of government had retained US
citizenship even while "leading" their nations. Why does this matter?
It matters because when acquiring US citizenship, like all people
obtaining US citizenship, they had to take an oath swearing allegiance
to the United States and no other country. You can't help but ask
yourself, are they really "leading" their nations, or obeying US

9 People You Will Definitely Meet in Hell - an Indian Perspective
An irreverent guide to world history from an Oriental perspective
Dick Cheney, Winston Churchill, and Mother Teresa make the cut
Rakesh Krishnan
 Winston Churchill: "Indians are ... the beastliest people in the
world, next to the Germans" - he slaughtered as many of both
countries' defenseless civilians as he could
Russia and India have been close allies for more than half a century.
Yet most Russians know little about India.
This is a country with its own world view, self-sustaining
civilization and a history that is remarkably similar to Russia’s.
Both countries have been subjected to savage invasions over the past
several centuries.
As we enter a new year, here’s an example of the Indian view of evil
by an Indian who has been a friend of Russia for longer than he can
remember. Don’t look for Russian villains here because Indians have a
different perspective – often at odds with the Western one, which alas
many Russians are still following.
However, you are unlikely to find fault with this list of nasty people
who have caused untold human misery.
9. Yahya Khan
It took Adolf Hitler 12 years to round up and kill six million
European Jews, but the Pakistanis, led by their President Yahya Khan,
killed three million of their own Bengali citizens in less than a
year. The fair-skinned Pakistanis of West Pakistan had such a racist,
visceral hatred for their Muslim brethren in East Pakistan that Yahya
is recorded as saying furiously: “Kill three million, and the rest
will eat out of our hands.” The disruption of normal life in the
region was cataclysmic: more than 30 million people – nearly half the
population – fled the cities and went back to their villages, while
ten million fled to India.
More than two million of those killed are believed to have been
Hindus. The rest were ordinary Bengali Muslims, students and
academics. Next, the Pakistanis targeted women, raping at least
200,000. Among Yahya’s executioners in East Pakistan was General
A.A.K. Niazi, who let loose his (fair skinned) Punjabi and Pathan
soldiers on the defenseless women, saying:
    “I will transform the breed of this bastard race.
Worse, after 93,000 Pakistan soldiers surrendered to the Indians, none
of the Indian military were held accountable. The victorious generals
not only prevented Bengali guerrillas from taking revenge on the
Pakistani soldiers, but worse, they kept them in comfortable POW camps
for more than a year.
There is a special place in hell for Yahya.
8. Talat Pasha
Not many people know the name of this genocidal maniac, but his deeds
are well known. Talat Pasha was the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire
from 1917 to 1918. In 1915 he issued an order to wipe out the
Armenians, forcing the entire population of Armenia – then under
Turkish rule – into concentration camps.
With their belongings, naked people were forced to trudge miles with
no food and were killed if they couldn’t continue. The entire male
population of Ankara was exterminated. Out of 2.5 million Armenians, 1
to 1.5 million were killed. In 1921, an Armenian assassination squad
ended Talat Pasha’s miserable existence.
7. Dick Cheney
Seventeen of the 19 hijackers of 9/11 were Saudi Arabians and yet the
US invaded Iraq, a country that had nothing to do with Islamic terror.
US Vice President Dick Cheney lied and fabricated evidence to get the
US to go to war with Iraq. This led to the destruction of a secular
country, its infrastructure and its army, but more tragically the war
caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and the
displacement of millions.
Сheney also authorized physical and sexual abuse, torture, rape,
sodomy and murder of Iraqi prisoners in the Abu Ghraib prison by US
Army and CIA personnel.
Worse, he used the war to make billions for his old company
Halliburton. This suggests that he destroyed an entire country with a
view to making money for himself and his cronies.
Iraq was once a bulwark against Islamic fundamentalism, but America’s
war is directly responsible for the emergence of Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
The reason Cheney’s boss for eight years isn’t here is because George
W. Bush was “an ignorant person who wanted to show his mother he could
do things his father couldn’t”. Cheney was the Svengali who prodded
the IQ challenged Bush to invade Iraq.
He is likely to be singled out for special treatment in hell.
6. Pol Pot
What’s unique about Pol Pot, the Prime Minister of Cambodia from 1976
to 1979, is that he wiped out 25 to 33 per cent of the population of
his country – nearly three million.
Pol Pot represents the ultimate communist fantasy – to destroy their
‘class enemies’. He wanted to uproot Cambodian civilization, turning
it into an agrarian society and the people into workers and peasants.
He is the only person in history who ordered an official genocide
against his country. He banned Buddhism, money, schools, markets and
personal possessions. Doctors, teachers, engineers and other skilled
people were systematically eliminated.
His communist government forced mass evacuations of cities, separating
people from friends and families.
The torture of class enemies happened on a massive scale, with
millions, including the elderly, pregnant women and children beaten to
death after being forced to work insanely long hours. People were
expected to work until they dropped dead.
Pol Pot was supported both by the Chinese and the Americans, because
he was an enemy of the Vietnamese.
Cambodia’s nightmare finally ended in December 1985 when the highly
professional Vietnamese army invaded the country and destroyed Pol
Pot’s headquarters. He fled to Thailand and after a few years moved to
China, where he was treated for cancer.
Pol Pot died in April 1998 of natural causes but is surely having a
painful time in hell.
5. Timur
Murderous tyrants fill history’s pages, but Timur of Samarkand was
cruel towards both man and beast. Among his favorite pastimes was
pushing elephants down steep cliffs.
A former bandit, Timur conquered Persia and Mesopotamia, invaded
Russia, Georgia, Syria, Turkey and India. In Baghdad he had 90,000
people beheaded so he could build towers with their skulls. In Turkey,
where he promised no bloodshed in return for surrender, he had 3,000
prisoners buried alive and pointed out that he had kept to the letter
of his oath. He also captured the Turkish Sultan and his wives, kept
the Sultan in a cage in his parlor and had his naked wives serve
visitors food and drinks.
In 1397, Timur invaded India. The entire stretch of land from the
Khyber Pass to the northern plains was subjected to massacres, rape,
pillage and kidnapping. He easily defeated the Muslim sultanate ruling
Delhi, but strong Hindu resistance made Timur even more vengeful than
usual. During the ransacking of Delhi, almost all those not killed
were distributed as slaves among Timur’s nobles. In his memoirs, he
claims his 15,000 Turks each “secured from 50 to 100
prisoners....there was no man with less than 20” and that “women were
obtained in such quantities as to exceed all count”.
Timur declared his army had only killed Hindus and spared Muslim
civilians. That’s rich, coming from someone who wiped out the city of
Timur is most likely being repeatedly thrown off a steep cliff into
hell’s lake of lava.
4. Aurangzeb
There’s a reason why Canadian author Tarek Fatah danced in the wee
hours in his bedroom when he received a phone call informing him that
Delhi’s Aurangzeb Road had been renamed after APJ Abdul Kalam.
Aurangzeb was singularly responsible for the continuing Hindu-Muslim
divide in India. The Mughal emperor came to the throne by murdering
his scholarly older brother and heir apparent Dara Shikoh. He also
blinded Dara’s young children.
Aurangzeb let elephants loose among the population and raided Hindu
lands, destroying ancient temples. The number of stunningly beautiful
temples he destroyed runs into the hundreds, if not thousands. Every
Hindu in his kingdom had to pay the hated jaziya tax to be allowed to
practice his religion. He claimed he was (unsuccessfully) “trying to
destroy the ancient sovereignties of this country”.
According to Fatah, “Aurangzeb today would be the equivalent of the
Islamic State’s Al-Baghdadi, if not Osama Bin Laden or the Taliban
Mullah Omar.”
Fatah is of Pakistani origin but unlike most South Asian Muslims he
realizes the great harm Aurangzeb caused India.
    “As emperor, Aurangzeb banned music, dancing and alcohol in the
Mughal Empire. In Sindh and Punjab where many Muslims attended Hindu
Brahmin preaches, he ordered the demolition of all schools and temples
where these took place, making it punishable for Muslims to dress like
Under the influence of Hinduism and the strong, sustained Hindu
resistance, Islam lost its edge in India. By the late 1600s, a unique
culture had formed in northern India, with Islam ready to shed its
terrorist behavior towards other religions. Dara, who translated
ancient Hindu texts into Persian, was symbolic of this remarkable
transformation of Islam.
However, Aurangzeb not only set the clock back on this reconciliation
but alienated all his Hindu allies. This led to fierce wars of
resistance that weakened the country and allowed the British to slowly
conquer India. The partition of India (although British-midwifed) can
be attributed to the deep divide created by this terrorist emperor.
His legacy lives on in the hearts of many Indian Muslims who regard
him as no less than a saint.
Hell is the right place for such a scumbag.
    (NOTE: Aurangzeb Road was the second most expensive street in New
Delhi. You are surely wondering who would name such a beautiful street
after such an evil person. The answer is, the British. New Delhi was
built by colonial Britain and several streets were named after brutal
Muslim rulers and barbaric representatives of the queen of England.
This is just one example of the West’s love for fundamentalist Islam.)
3. Mohandas Gandhi
Mohandas Gandhi’s pacifism caused great harm to India and Hindus.
Muslims refused to listen to him and attacked Hindus who had been
effectively disarmed by Gandhi’s appeals for peace. This encouraged
Muslims to attack Hindus even more because they knew Hindus weren’t
going to retaliate.
Had Hindus been allowed to attack Muslims, or at least be prepared to
defend themselves with weapons, the cycle of Muslim violence could
have been nipped in the bud. By going on hunger fasts in order to
prevent Hindus from retaliating, Gandhi was the chief villain of
Partition. Hundreds of thousands of Hindus were killed and thousands
of women raped because of Gandhi’s imposed pacifism. He advocated a
senseless surrender to murder.
    According to Indologist and Belgian orientalist Koenraad Elst,
“The fundamental problem with Gandhi’s pacifism, not in the initial
stages but when he had become the world-famous leader of India’s
freedom movement (1920-47), was his increasing extremism. All sense of
proportion had vanished when he advocated non-violence not as a
technique of moral pressure by a weaker on a stronger party, but as a
form of masochistic surrender.”
Gandhi’s advice to the victims of communal violence was “breathtaking
for its callousness in the face of human suffering”. During his prayer
meeting on 1 May 1947, he prepared the Hindus and Sikhs for the
anticipated massacres of their kind in the upcoming state of Pakistan
with these words:
    “I would tell the Hindus to face death cheerfully if the Muslims
are out to kill them. I would be a real sinner if after being stabbed
I wished in my last moment that my son should seek revenge. I must die
without rancor. You may turn round and ask whether all Hindus and all
Sikhs should die. Yes, I would say. Such martyrdom will not be in
Worse, believing he was some kind of mahatma (great soul), he tried to
prove his self-control by often sleeping and bathing naked with other
women. These women included his grandniece, Manu, and the wife of his
grandnephew, who were both 18 when they started sleeping in the same
bed as Gandhi, who was 77 years old at the time.
    Graeme Donald writes in Lies, Damned Lies and History: A Catalogue
of Historical Errors and Misunderstandings: “All had to sleep naked
and, just to make doubly sure of his resolve, Gandhi would take them
to bed in pairs. Some as young as 12, several girls later acknowledged
that they did often ‘render service’ to Gandhi but refused to
Donald adds that the girls were selected for their “pertness” to
“stiffen his resolve” for celibacy. “Very much a case of ‘damn, failed
again, must try harder tomorrow night.”
Such a paedophile belongs in hell.
2. Mother Teresa
Mother Teresa took money stolen from pensioners by financial fraud
artist Charles Keating. She accepted donations from the murderous
Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier. She was also a friend of Enver
Hoxha, the communist dictator of Albania.
Worse, Teresa’s 600 missions in 123 countries have been described as
"homes for the dying" by visiting doctors. The doctors observed a
significant lack of hygiene, even unfit conditions, as well as a
shortage of actual care, inadequate food and no painkillers. Teresa
claimed that “There is something beautiful in seeing the poor accept
their lot, to suffer it like Christ's passion. The world gains much
from their suffering.’'
Her nuns were not provided with medical training, the use of mosquito
repellents, or information about malaria and vaccinations, because
Teresa believed "God" would look after the nuns. One of her nuns got
into trouble with the order for helping a man with dysentery who was
dying. Teresa quoted Peter 2:18-23, which orders slaves to obey their
masters even if they are abusive and difficult, and urged her nuns to
obey superiors without question.
But she was a hypocrite: seeking out the best medical care for
herself. Despite the fact that medical tourists from the West travel
to India for treatment, Teresa reckoned India wasn't good enough for
her. She was admitted to California's Scripps Clinic and Research
Teresa was stingy even during national emergencies. During Indian
floods she offered prayers and medallions of the Virgin Mary but no
monetary aid.
Teresa's fundraising sermons persuaded people that Calcutta is a city
of lepers and beggars. Her nuns lied to the global media that the city
had 450,000 lepers, knowing that this would make rich westerners
despatch their dollars.
All abandoned children who are taken into Teresa's missions are
brought up as Christians. In India Teresa was (and her mission
continues to be) actively engaged in proselytizing, which is not only
illegal but has a negative impact on India's complex social hierarchy.
For her lies, stolen cash and allowing little children suffer painful
deaths, she is a favorite member of hell.
1. Winston Churchill
This scumbag takes the pole position in this list.
Like No.10 Yahya Khan, Prime Minister Winston Churchill managed to
outdo Hitler and his Nazi cohorts. The Germans may have taken 12 years
to murder 6 million Jews, but their Teutonic cousins, the British,
managed to kill almost 4 million Indians in just over a year, with
Churchill cheering from the sidelines.
Australian biochemist Dr Gideon Polya has called the Bengal Famine a
“manmade holocaust” because Churchill’s policies were directly
responsible for the disaster. He knowingly and enthusiastically caused
the famine in 1942-43 by transferring vast quantities of food grain
from India to Britain.
To Churchill, the starvation of Indians was less serious than that of
Greeks. When the British administrators urged him to release food
stocks for India, Churchill responded with a telegram asking why
Gandhi hadn’t died yet.
Churchill’s hostility toward Indians has long been documented. At a
War Cabinet meeting, he blamed the Indians for the famine, saying they
breed like rabbits, and are a beastly people with a beastly religion.
On another occasion, he insisted they were “the beastliest people in
the world next to the Germans”.
According to author Madhusree Mukerjee,
    “Churchill’s attitude toward India was quite extreme, and he hated
Indians, mainly because he knew India couldn’t be held for very long.”
The fact is the British Prime Minister possessed an extraordinary
range of prejudices. During World War II, in a memorandum to the War
    “All the industrial centers should be attacked in intense fashion,
every effort being made to terrorize the population.”
He also pushed for the firebombing of German population centers such
as Dresden, Leipzig and Chemnitz which killed 200,000 civilians in
1945. It was the only way the British could show they were in the war.
In 1944, Churchill came up with a cataclysmic plan to convert Germany
into a “country primarily agricultural and pastoral in its character”.
The Morgenthau Plan if implemented would have starved 10 million
Germans to death in the first year alone. US President Franklin
Roosevelt admitted Churchill was “bought off” by the American offer of
$6.5 billion in Lend Lease.
No human being deserves to be in hell more than Winston.
    (Disclaimer: As an atheist I don’t believe in heaven or hell in
the religious sense. But the universe is ruled by the laws of physics
and mathematics, which imply that all actions have consequences.)

- disintermediation
- make it all open, universal access to hack, read, learn, experiment, and share
- libre software, the commons and the licenses that facilitate this
commons, underlies all modern commerce, every major 'recent'
- there will never be another commercial encyclopaedia
- for the cost of 600km of roads (1000s built every year), every book
in every European library can be scanned and made available to all,
and they should be
- free software is most advanced tech education - anybody anywhere,
can get to the state of the art, by downloading, reading, experimental
and sharing freely - true computer science, more knowledge for the
human race
- bulk of human learning was not recent
- all knowledge should be universally available, not doing so will
stunt further growth and innovation which permits further growth - a
social requirement for growth
- "copyright bargain" is not an immutable bargain, just a convenience
for monetizers, not even relevantly apply to almost all of important
human knowledge in most fields - Plato not owned by anybody
- what will 21st Centure education systems be like?
- 3billion of the 7billion people in the world are children - how many
Einsteins or Shakespears do we want to throw away today?
- the universalization of the access to knowledge, is today the single
most important force available for increasing innovation and human
wealth on the planet - nobody should be afraid to advocate for it
because someone might shout "copyright!"
- this also allows young people to take their economic and
professional destinies into their own hands - an absolute requirement
for social and political stability in next generation
- more jobs outside hierarchies, less jobs inside hierarchies
- young people know the rules have changed, its governments that don't
- "privacy" means:
   1) secrecy - content of a message is obscure to all but its maker
and intended recipient
   2) anonymity - messages are not obscure, but the points generating
and receiving those messages are obscure
   3) autonomy - the opportunity to live a life in which the decisions
that you make are unaffected by others access to secret or anonymous
- there's a reason that cities have always been engines of economic
growth - not because bankers live there - they live there -because-
cities are engines of economic growth (since Sumer), because young
people move there to make new ways of being, taking advantage of fact
that the city is where you escape the surveillance of the village and
the social control of the farm
- the city is the historical system for the production of anonymity
and the ability to experiment autonomously in ways of living - govts/
"we" are closing this
Some great personal historical anecdotes.
- We are on the verge of eliminating the human right to be alone, to
do your own thinking, in own place, in own way, without anybody
- prices, offers, commodities, opportunities, are now being based on
the data mining of everything
- senior govt official of current administration/govt, said to me
after US rules changes of length of time for keeping all info about
citizens for whom nothing is suspected, that the "minor" changes in
the Ascroft rules, all minor details of those for whom nothing is
suspected, will now be kept not for 180 days but for 5 years (an
approximation for infinity)
- Eben: should we have a law, based on the constitution, for this?
Govt official just laughed. Complete despotism.
- One of the problems of innovation under conditions of complete
despotism - one of the problems of 20th century totalitarianism, is
that it eliminates the possibility of free markets and innovation.
- the network is an extraordinary platform for social control
- USA and China have adopted almost identical points of view/ actions
- robust full society network people graph, connecting people to
everybody they know, and exhaustive data mining of society, is
fundamental govt policy for both governments for "stability
- we, who understand what's happening, need to be very vocal about this
- not just our civil liberties at stake - I shouldn't need to say
this, that should be enough, but of course it's not - we need to make
clear that the cost, the other part, is the very vitality, vibrancy,
of invention, culture and discourse, that wide open, robust,
uninhibited public debate that the US Supreme Court so loved in NYT v
Sullivan, and that freedom to tinker, invent, be different,
non-conformist, for which people have always moved to the cities that
gave them anonymity, that gave people a change to experiment with
anonymity and to experiment with who they are and what they can do
(the loss of this is the cost close to being paid by us all)
- this opportunity to experiment anonymously in being, thinking and
doing, more than anything else, is what will sustain social vitality
and economic growth in 21stCentury
- of course there are other reasons, protection for the integrity of
the human soul, but that's not govt's concern
- precisely for the glory of how we understand civil society that that
is NOT govt's concern
- precisely our commitment to the idea of individual's development at
own pace, and in own way, that has been centerpiece of OUR society's
fundamental commitment, that means that protection of the integrity of
the human soul is OUR business and NOT govt's business
- we must be clear to govt that there is no tension between
maintenance of civil liberty in the form of the right to be left
alone, and economic policy of securing innovation under austerity -
they require the same thing:
 - free software
 - free hardware we can hack on
 - free access to information
 - right to share freely
 - free spectrum to communication without "let"? or hindrance
- to everyone on earth without regard to the ability to pay, to
provide a pathway to an independent ,economic  and intellectual life
for every young person
- we have the tech we need
 - cheap micro servers
 - the right software
- need to retrofit the first law of robotics into current society, in
the next few minutes, or we're cooked
 - this is CIVIL innovation
- must continue the long lifetime of personal computers that everybody
can hack on, by using them, needing them, spreading them around
- use our own force as consumers and technologists to deprecate closed
networks and locked down objects
- without clear guidance in public policy, we will remain a tiny minority - 8.3%
- innovation under austerity is our battle cry, not for things we care
about, but for the things the other people care about, our entree to
social policy, and our LAST chance, to do in govt what we've NOT been
able to do by attempting to preserve our mere liberties, which have
been shamefully abused by our friends in govt as well as by our

our message

Another factoid here in this well presented analysis - not only Saddam
but also Gaddafi attempted to jump off the USD onto the Euro, then to
a gold-backed local currency (dinar) - well well well, the bully keeps
demanding others' lunch money.
Now Iran seems to be able to survive the jump, due to Russia's
backing. And it certainly seems clear to me why Russia is so demonized
- they are leading the charge, and giving others the courage (like
Iran and India exchanging oil for Rupees).

The Global De-dollarization and the US Policies
Column: Economics
Region: USA in the World
34234234In its quest for world domination, which the White House has
been pursuing for more than a century, it relied on two primary tools:
the US dollar and military might. In order to prevent Washington from
establishing complete global hegemony, certain countries have recently
been revising their positions towards these two elements by developing
alternative military alliances and by breaking with their dependence
on the US dollar.
Until the mid-twentieth century, the gold standard was the dominant
monetary system, based on a fixed quantity of gold reserves stocked in
national banks, which limited lending. At that time, the United States
managed to become the owner of 70% of world’s gold reserves (excluding
the USSR), therefore it pushed its weakened competitor, the UK, aside
resulting to the creation of the Bretton Woods financial system in
1944. That’s how the US dollar became the predominant currency for
international payments.
But a quarter century later this system had proven ineffective due to
its inability to contain the economic growth of Germany and Japan,
along with the reluctance of the US to adjust its economic policies to
maintain the dollar-gold balance. At that time, the dollar experienced
a dramatic decline but it was saved by the support of rich oil
exporters, especially once Saudi Arabia began to exchange its black
gold for US weapons and support in talks with Richard Nixon. As a
result, President Richard Nixon in 1971 unilaterally ordered the
cancellation of the direct convertibility of the United States dollar
to gold, and instead he established the Jamaican currency system in
which oil has become the foundation of the US dollar system.
Therefore, it’s no coincidence that from that moment on the control
over oil trade has become the number one priority of Washington’s
foreign policy. In the aftermath of the so-called Nixon Shock the
number of US military engagements in the Middle East and other oil
producing regions saw a sharp increase. Once this system was supported
by OPEC members, the global demand for US petrodollars hit an all time
high. Petrodollars became the basis for America domination over the
global financial system which resulted in countries being forced to
buy dollars in order to get oil on the international market.
Analysts believe that the share of the United States in today’s world
gross domestic product shouldn’t exceed 22%. However, 80% of
international payments are made with US dollars. As a result, the
value of the US dollar is exceedingly high in comparison with other
currencies, that’s why consumers in the United States receive imported
goods at extremely low prices. It provides the United States with
significant financial profit, while high demand for dollars in the
world allows the US government to refinance its debt at very low
interest rates.
Under these circumstances, those heding against the dollar are
considered a direct threat to US economic hegemony and the high living
standards of its citizens, and therefore political and business
circles in Washington attempt by all means to resist this process.This
resistance manifested itself in the overthrow and the brutal murder of
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who decided to switch to Euros for oil
payments, before introducing a gold dinar to replace the European
However, in recent years, despite Washington’s desire to use whatever
means to sustain its position within the international arena, US
policies are increasingly faced with opposition. As a result, a
growing number of countries are trying to move from the US dollar
along with its dependence on the United States, by pursuing a policy
of de-dollarization. Three states that are particularly active in this
domain are China, Russia and Iran. These countries are trying to
achieve de-dollarization at a record pace, along with some European
banks and energy companies that are operating within their borders.
The Russian government held a meeting on de-dollarization in spring of
2014, where the Ministry of Finance announced the plan to increase the
share of ruble-denominated contracts and the consequent abandonment of
dollar exchange. Last May at the Shanghai summit, the Russian
delegation manged to sign the so-called “deal of the century” which
implies that over the next 30 years China will buy $ 400 billion worth
of Russia’s natural gas, while paying in rubles and yuans. In
addition, in August 2014 a subsidiary company of Gazprom announced its
readiness to accept payment for 80,000 tons of oil from Arctic
deposits in rubles that were to be shipped to Europe, while the
payment for the supply of oil through the “Eastern Siberia – Pacific
Ocean” pipeline can be transferred in yuans. Last August while
visiting the Crimea, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin announced that
“the petrodollar system should become history” while “Russia is
discussing the use of national currencies in mutual settlements with a
number of countries.” These steps recently taken by Russia are the
real reasons behind the West’s sanction policy.
In recent months, China has also become an active member of this
“anti-dollar” campaign, since it has signed agreements with Canada and
Qatar on national currencies exchange, which resulted in Canada
becoming the first offshore hub for the yuan in North America. This
fact alone can potentially double or even triple the volume of trade
between the two countries since the volume of the swap agreement
signed between China and Canada is estimated to be a total of 200
billion yuans.
China’s agreement with Qatar on direct currency swaps between the two
countries are the equivalent of $ 5.7 billion and has cast a heavy
blow to the petrodollar becoming the basis for the usage of the yuan
in Middle East markets. It is no secret that the oil-producing
countries of the Middle Eastern region have little trust in the US
dollar due to the export of inflation, so one should expect other OPEC
countries to sign agreements with China.
As for the Southeast Asia region, the establishment of a clearing
center in Kuala Lumpur, which will promote greater use of the yuan
locally, has become yet another major step that was made by China in
the region. This event occurred in less than a month after the leading
financial center of Asia – Singapore – became a center of the yuan
exchange in Southeast Asia after establishing direct dialogue
regarding the Singapore dollar and the yuan.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has recently announced its reluctance to
use US dollars in its foreign trade. Additionally, the President of
Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev has recently tasked the National Bank
with the de-dollarization of the national economy.
All across the world, the calls for the creation of a new
international monetary system are getting louder with each passing
day. In this context it should be noted that the UK government plans
to release debts denominated in yuans while the European Central Bank
is discussing the possibility of including the yuan in its official
Those trends are to be seen everywhere, but in the midst of
anti-Russian propaganda, Western newsmakers prefer to keep quiet about
these facts, in particular, when inflation is skyrocketing in the
United States. In recent months, the proportion of US Treasury bonds
in the Russian foreign exchange reserves has been shrinking rapidly,
being sold at a record pace, while this same tactic has been used by a
number of different states.
To make matters worse for the US, many countries seek to export their
gold reserves from the United States, which are deposited in vaults at
the Federal Reserve Bank. After a scandal of 2013, when the US Federal
Reserve refused to return German gold reserves to its respective
owner, the Netherlands have joined the list of countries that are
trying to retrieve their gold from the US. Should it be successful the
list of countries seeking the return of gold reserves will double
which may result in a major crisis for Washington.
The above stated facts indicate that the world does not want to rely
on US dollars anymore. In these circumstances, Washington relies on
the policy of deepening regional destabilization, which, according to
the White House strategy, must lead to a considerable weakening of any
potential US rivals. But there’s little to no hope for the United
States to survive its own wave of chaos it has unleashed across the

@_subject: "network shock-testing"-resistant data serving 
Answers anyone?
I know wikileaks has a bad name with some, but let's set that aside,
since I think it is an easy concept for lay people to understand, and
to discuss this particular network challenge.
- I have a large a juicy data set leak, a particularly gruesome and
indicting of the establishment, mil video.
- I can upload it piecemeal and from varied and "random" locations,
pre-scouted to be sure there are no surveillance cameras to monitor my
piecemeal uploads.
- But ultimately the result exists on some server, to serve up this
juicy media frenzy fueling firetruck for the govt.
- So downloaders can be "network shock tested" by interrupting the
stream (with say a forged onion site), and voila - the end user for
that particular stream is identified.
- Similarly, downloading from the original/ non-forged onion site, say
100 'simultaneous' downloads, and I (network global viewer) can
simultaneously stop all downloads and watch which physical host has a
drop in outgoing load.
So these are two problems - network shock-testing the end-user

Kerry Says If Ceasefire Fails He May Partition Syria
Because, you know, God made him the owner of Syria
Mark Nicholas
That's Western 'nation-building' and international law for you
John Kerry is an incredible motivator! He has just told (
) Syrian jihadi-controlled (
) rebellion that all it has to do is sabotage the upcoming ceasefire
he has agreed to with Moscow and he will reward them with a mini-state
carved out from Syria. What better incentive to abide by the deal and
cease hostilities could he possibly give them?
    John Kerry, the US secretary of state, has said he will move
towards a plan B that could involve a partition of Syria if a planned
ceasefire due to start in the next few days does not materialize, or
if a genuine shift to a transitional government does not take place in
the coming months.
Oh yes, you may have thought that "partition" is a bad word, but
that's only true when the Russians do it (
). When Americans partition a foreign country (Korea, Vietnam,
Yugoslavia, Serbia, Sudan) that is actually a good thing.
Which presents us with a problem since Kerry is apparently willing to
invite Putin to help with the partition:
    Kerry suggested partition could form part of an eventual solution,
saying “this can get a lot uglier and Russia has to be sitting there
evaluating that too. It may be too late to keep it as a whole Syria if
it is much longer”.
    It is the first time Kerry has spoken of partition, although some
believe Putin would be content to see this happen.
This creates a moral problem for us because while a unilateral
partition of Syria by the virtuous US would be a good thing, a joint
US-Russian partition would be tainted by the virtue of having evil
Russian paws over it.
Hopefully the Russian nation-breaking dictator will decline the offer
of the nation-building Obama Administration official and avert the
possibility of American-Russian collusion in breaking up a sovereign
third country.
PS. Wasn't it just a short few weeks ago that the West was accusing
Moscow of plotting partition of Syria (
) ?  How times change.

Week 20 of Russia's Syria Campaign: The Ceasefire Deal Is a Huge
Victory for Russia
With it Russia has forced every single rebel faction to make a stark
decision on whether it wants Al Nusra ties or not
The Saker
(The Unz Review)
Diplomatic victory brought on by military victories
Originally appeared at The Unz Review
The recent agreement between the USA and Russia really solves nothing,
it does not even end the war, and both sides are expressing a great
deal of caution about its future implementation.  And yet, this is a
huge victory for Russia.  While it is too early to say that “the
Russians won in Syria”, I think that it is now fair to say that the
Russian position on Syria has won.  Here is why:
First: nobody is suggesting anymore that Assad will be ousted or
Damascus taken.  That, in turn, means that everybody has now
recognized that Syrian Arab Republic, backed by Russia, has
successfully repelled the aggression of the huge coalition the
AngloZionists built to overthrow Assad.
Second: Russia has forced the UNSC and the USA to admit that the vast
majority of those who fight Assad today are terrorists.  Of course,
this is not how this was declared, but if you look at the
organizations which the UNSC has already declared as ‘terrorists’ then
you already have an absolute majority of the anti-Assad forces.  This
means that the moral and legal legitimacy of the anti-Assad forces
lies in tatters.
Third: regardless of what Erdogan does actually try to do next, there
are now clear signs that neither NATO, nor the EU nor even the Turkish
high military command want a war with Russia. And that means that
Erdogan’s gamble has not paid off and that his entire Syria policy is
now comprehensively dead. Keep in mind that following the treacherous
attack on the Russian Su-24 the Kremlin made it a policy goal to
“Saakashvilize” Erdogan.  This goal is now almost reached and
Erdogan’s future looks very, very bleak: everybody ( except maybe the
Saudis) is sick and tired of this maniac.  The best thing which could
happen to Turkey now would for the military to get rid of Erdogan and
to replace him with somebody willing to repair all the damage he did.
Fourth: all the threats to impose a no-fly zone or to occupy Syria
have now been invalidated by an agreement which basically declares
that anybody not respecting the cease-fire is a legitimate target for
engagement and destruction.
Fifth: the USA had to accept the humiliation of having to agree to all
of the Russian terms for the current ceasefire.  Yes, of course, the
USA can, and probably will, try renege on part, or all, of this
agreement, but the precedent has been set and it will be very hard, if
not impossible, for the USA to openly return to the pre-2016 policies.
Sixth: does anybody still remember the rhetoric of Hillary Clinton
about Syria and Russia?  Her position was crystal clear: Assad must go
and those who support him “punished”.  Even after the Russian military
offensive began, the US refused to tell the Russians where the “good
terrorists” were and where the “bad terrorists” were.  No exchange of
information with Russians was acceptable.  Now the Americans had to
agree to work with the Russians on a map of Syria designating where
the participants of the ceasefire and where those who were not
included in the ceasefire were deployed. In other words,the US will
now have to share with Russia all the info it previously refused to
share and work with the Russians on a daily basis.
Seventh: Russia has basically co-opted the so-called “Free Syrian
Army”.  How?  By basically forcing every single faction in Syria to
chose between one of two possible statuses: being a ‘terrorist’ (and a
fair target for destruction) or being a participant in a political
process entirely designed by Russia. The Russians are now even opening
a “Truce Center” at the Khmeimin airbase (
 )
near Latakia which will now “render assistance” to all the parties to
the ceasefire.
This, for the time being, is mainly a diplomatic victory, of course,
but a Russian diplomatic victory made possible by a Russian military
victory. A tiny Russian military contingent has basically completely
neutralized the plans of an entire worldwide Empire. That, in itself,
is an amazing achievement.
The other big winner here are, in my opinion, the Kurds who, according
to British officials (
 ),
appear to be coordinating their military operations with the Syrian
army and the Russian Aerospace Forces and who now might well even
achieve their dreams of joining the Iraqi and Syria regions of
Kurdistan.  Which is just about the worst nightmare for the Turks come
true, hence the still remaining risk of a Turkish military operation
ostensibly to create a ‘buffer zone’ but really to save face.  That
kind of intervention will remain a possibility for as long as the
Turks can continue to hope to commit aggression against their
neighbors under the protection of NATO and the USA. And that ain’t
gonna change anytime in the future.
And then there are the Saudis.  They are very, very angry.  They are
angry to the point of making not so subtle threats about using nuclear
weapons to deal with their adversaries.  See for yourself:
Actually, since Pakistan got The Bomb, I would not dismiss any Saudi
claims of having a number of nuclear devices.  But what does that
really mean?
Absolutely nothing.
It is quite possible that the Saudis have the know how for a nuclear
device.  And it is quite possible that they even got their hands on
enough nuclear materials for a few bombs. They might even have
succeeded in purchasing a few nuclear devices from the Pakistanis or
Israelis.  But even if that is true, the reality is that the Saudis
don’t even have the military capability to deal with the poorest Arab
country on the planet (Yemen) and that they most definitely don’t have
the military capability to engage their nuclear devices in a way which
would allow them to achieve any kind of military advantage. After all,
what are we talking about here? Using nuclear weapons against the
Syrian military? Against Iran? Against Russia? This is absolutely
ridiculous. The reality is that whatever nuclear capabilities the
Saudis might or might not have, the fact that they would make nuclear
threats is just a sign of weakness and fear, not a sign of strength.
This is why nobody is impressed by these statements, least of all the
intended targets of such threats.
While it is quite true that the latest agreement between the USA and
Russia does not mark the end of the war in Syria, it is a turning
point, a kind of a Minsk-2 Agreement which nobody really wants to
comply with, but which seals the defeat of the AngloZionist plans in
Syria as much as Minsk-2 meant the defeat of the Ukronazi dream.
Time is now on the Russian/Syrian side.  With each passing day the
Russian task force in Syria will become more powerful, as will the
Syrian Armed Forces.  That, by itself, will not be enough to defeat
Daesh, and we can expect a stiff resistance from the Takfiri crazies,
but the writing is on the wall for all to see: the more the Russians
and the Americans become directly and jointly involved, the less
Turkey and Saudi Arabia will be able to determine the outcome of the
war.  In other words, while this is far from being the end of Daesh,
it is the beginning of the end for Daesh in Syria.
Yet again the nay-sayers and Putin-haters have been proven wrong.  To
be honest, so have I:  I would never have guessed that the Russians
could have achieved so much with so little and yet they did pull off
this extremely dangerous gamble and they won.  Only an extremely
skillful combination of military, economic, diplomatic and political
means could have yielded such a remarkable result but Putin,
apparently, found this perfect mix.  The path ahead remains extremely
dangerous, for sure, but the outcome of the 20 week long Russian
military intervention in Syria is nothing short of remarkable.

Eben Moglen (refer previous thread) has said he will not run for US
president. That's not only a great shame, it's a disgrace!
If someone is within distance to meet him face to face (I will not be
travelling to America, but if you know he is to travel to Australia, I
will meet him here face to face, but that will be too late for the
current presidential 'race'), -please- meet him face to face and
remind him that it is because good men and women with good hearts and
intentions such as himself, that do NOT stand for positions of
authority in the system within which they find themselves existing,
that is, by their acquiescence, that the tyranny of the despots and
sociopaths who DO stand prevails, prevails over them, and as regards
America, prevails over much of the world.
If Eben will not stand personally, then he has a duty of care to
everyone and a duty of care to his own principles, to nominate someone
whom he knows is of "good spirit" who is willing to stand!
If Eben can find no such individual, then he has a DUTY to stand for
president, and in this case if he does not stand, he is complicit to
the evil of the United States of America - implicitly, but complicit
none the less!
Feel free to forward him this email, but I find it is always much
better to speak with someone face to face. If you plan to do so,
perhaps print this email out.
Good men and women must stand. Perhaps you know the soccer mom living
next door who has demonstrated consistent "ethics" and good intention,
and ought be presented with this same position - stand, or be
complicit in your acquiescence to the evil.
It does not require a million dollar "slush fund", it requires a firm
grasp of reality, and of our individual complicity with that reality,
and a willingness to communicate the simplicity to others - we are in
an age of unprecedented rapidity of communication, of "flash mobs"
which are normally co-opted marketing crap, but this does not take
away from the reality of what's possible today.
We tech people talk far too much. Every part of our "Western" lives is
pervaded by politics! We cannot escape this simple fact that while
"good" men and women refuse to stand, since 'we' have lives to live,
creativity to explore and express, parties and sports events to attend
and families to raise, because of all these reasons and many besides,
that despots and sociopaths are the only individuals to stand and
therefore hold the positions of power! Over us! Over the world!

Russia seems to be launching a silent attack on the supremacy of the
dollar and the Western countries, as President Putin is buying gold
with “little fanfare, but on a large scale”; as there is no evident
economic reason for such an increase, the move will provide Russia
with an insurance against crises, according to German media.
“It is a silent attack on the supremacy of the dollar,” states German
newspaper Die Welt, referring to Russia’s recent increased resupply of
its gold reserves.
The outlet notes that “it is a declaration of independence, proclaimed

Russia’s stock now stands at more than 1,300 tons, it adds (according
to statistics portal Statista, as of February 2016, it is already
almost 1,400 tons — 1,392,9).
“While politicians fear a new Cold War between Moscow and the West, it

Those who advocate for a 1% "transaction" tax, e.g. 1% paid on every
deposit, or else on every withdrawal, have been labelled conspiracy
The real reason for the opposition may just happen to be that the
banks, and other major multi-national entities, structure their
selfish selves so that they pay tax of about 3 orders of magnitude
LESS than 1% tax, and so they don't want a 1000 fold increase to the
taxes they pay.
Setting aside for a moment of course that the constitutional monopoly
on "money power" which is supposed to be held by the government was
taken from "we the people" at gunpoint (at least I am aware this is
the case in both USA and Australia). And setting aside the criminal
nature of modern demoncratic so-called "representative" governments.
And setting aside all sorts of other problems.
"The banks paid little or no tax in the country despite reporting
billions of dollars in sales and profits, it was revealed through a
Reuters investigation. Combined, the banks with a total workforce of

US$5.3bn in profits from the UK in 2014. However, the total
corporation tax they paid for the period was a meagre US$31m or 0.001%
of their revenues.

provides a foundation for some genuine soul searching, in the CIA, the

failed state, etc, etc.

looking to conduct all trade in national currencies. Moscow and New
Delhi are already drawing up the plans (
    India and Russia are developing a road map for mutual settlements
in national currencies which could open prospects for both countries,
India’s Ambassador to Russia Pankaj Saran told RIA Novosti on
    "Transition to mutual settlements in national currencies of the
BRICS looks promising. Russian and Indian companies are interested in
using national currencies in trade settlements,” he said, adding that
there is already a mechanism in place for them to use.
    According to the ambassador, New Delhi and Moscow aim expanding
economic and trade cooperation. They have already chosen priority
sectors such as agriculture, pharmaceuticals, jewelry, technical
equipment and machinery, oil and gas, and textiles.
The decision is expected to drastically boost trade between the two
countries. Russia and India are hoping to triple trade to $30 billion
over the next ten years. The two nations have also signed a number of
landmark defense and energy deals. New Delhi has already approved the
purchase of five S-400 air defense systems.
BRICS is dumping the dollar -- and Russia is leading the charge.

coderman, I appreciate your 'introspective' self questioning of

to be making/ not seeing.
I guess that's the ultimate propaganda success really - not being
aware that your country is always at war, and pretty much always has
been. War is the ultimate rejection and domination of the sovereignty
of other nations and individuals. So a government having their
nation's people thinking they're not at war, and most of the time have
not been, is the fundamental delusion of and successful propaganda of
Your 93% link is eye opening - I knew it was coup after coup (war

II's (alleged) Christmas message from December 2015, that would be

I find that polemic to be very good - not for the cliches of course,
but for two things:
1) an insight from a non American of how America was viewed leading up
to the end of the cold war (originally just "us vs them, we can do it
cheaper" eventually "us evil vs them higher moral ground");
(This itself might be nothing more than a cliche, but I appreciate the
insight from a post- Communist block human)
2) a proscription for "saving" the United States of America - find the
moral high ground, "export" that moral high ground (in action, not in
propaganda words); [s/moral/ethical/ as you will]
I am a "Western" non-American (Australia) and when I read the "
founding fathers' " words of the USofA and of Australia, I actually
find some of them to be genuinely worthy to strive for, to hold as
worthy in general for future generations.
The overt corruption, blatant violation of foundation (constitutional)
principles and basic human rights by the various "Western" governments
is enough to draw out the cynic in the best intentioned individual and
send the rest to some beer and TV soma.
I agree with the proscription of this polemic of "live/ action the
higher moral ground".
That is clear, unambiguous, allows for the personal/ conscience (Juan,
I'm keeping a firm open mind to political anarchy :) , and thankfully
proscriptive. In a world where almost every proscription is shouted
from tall poppy hills and nearly every cry for sanity is met with
bottomless cynicism (the latter of which I am entirely guilty as
charged), this simple and dare I say unassailable "solution" might be
something we can work with (propagandise, educate about, demand from
our "elected authorities").
"Embrace your inner control freak - demand ethical government!" perhaps?
Short of a benevolent (ethical) dictator (head of government), perhaps
the only ethical government is No Government - just can't seem to
shake this thought these days... damn you Juan! ;)
Yes they have the firepower to easily win a hot war. The cold war is
that war for the hearts and or minds of the people - and Russia did
not lose this war to America per se, they lost it due to their own
leadership ( / their manifestation of "communism") - even though, as
the apparently Russian cold-war experiencing blogger said "America won
because they had the higher moral ground".
Frankly re the current Subject: "Self Preservation and Irreversible
Decline", "Moral Superiority" is I say the most practical answer yet -
if we trust that in principle humans are basically righteous/ ethical/
moral/ good, this seems a solid foundation for justifying political
anarchism yes?
Likewise direct democracy.
Before anyone jumps in to ask "surely the same applies to
'democracy'", note that democracy devolves to power ultimately wielded
by a very small cadre of individuals, in the case of USA and executive
orders, just one individual it seems, which is particularly
problematic since sociopaths are by nature attracted to such positions
or to controlling i.e. compromising or puppeteering those in such
- whereas with direct democracy 'the people' only have themselves to
blame, since they vote for/against every single law and executive
order, and in political anarchy, well who knows since we haven't seen
a large anarchist community AFAICT - perhaps anarchy would be more
practical and or long lasting than 'western (two) party democracy',
perhaps it would devolve to a modern tribal type thing... I doubt any
system will achieve a long lasting utopianism given the average state
of consciousness of humans on our lovely blue planet.
Perhaps s/moral/ethical/ ?  I have never quite understood why people
get hung up on these terms - perhaps past experience of religionists
ramming "Godly morals" down the throat? - if so, take control of the
word and smite those who would blaspheme the one true definition of
"moral" according to the god of your own sensible mind! :)
("Smite" as in, use words to cut them and slice them to size.)
A couple of definitions:
  Ethics \Eth"ics\ ([e^]th"[i^]ks), n. [Cf. F. ['e]thique. See
     {Ethic}.]
     The science of human duty; the body of rules of duty drawn
     from this science; a particular system of principles and
     rules concerting duty, whether true or false; rules of
     practice in respect to a single class of human actions; as,
     political or social ethics; medical ethics.

  ethics
      Ethics is the field of study that is concerned
     with questions of value, that is, judgments about what human
     behaviour is "good" or "bad".  Ethical judgments are no
     different in the area of computing from those in any other
     area.  Computers raise problems of privacy, ownership, theft,
     and power, to name but a few.

      n 1: motivation based on ideas of right and wrong [syn: {ethical

Damn it Juan! I was just about to post a "Thanks Razer, evidently
there's no new thought under the sun" (and Razer, thanks regardless),
then in true form, you point out a fundamental limitation in (in this
case Casey's, and what I thought was my own) presented position.
This highlights for me personally how programmed I am in my think, and
how useful it is to be perpetually reminded of at least one or two of
the limitations of said think. But shit, it's embarrassing how
programmed I am...
I sure f-ing hope -one- of these days I can give "the Juan

How could that even be possible? Pre-crime? Statistically some small
percentage of new borns are born to be sociopaths right (from memory 1
to 2%)?
Perhaps, how could it be possible to educate ourselves/ act, such that
those wielding power in whatever social system is in place, are no
more sociopathic than the 'average society member'?
Or is there no hope since sociopaths will always be drawn to any
position of power regardless, and the rest of us will tend to leave
said positions to them and suffer the (repetitive historical)
consequences (the "the only people on juries are those dum enough to
not get off of them" syndrome)?

That would require a truly benevolent 'dictator' at the top ... Gandhi
when prime minister of India was shot by one of his own security
guards, the Israeli prime minister who got in on a "peace with
Palestinians" platform some years back got shot (by an Israeli),  the
only two US presidents who (attempted to) print greenbacks rather than
borrow from the banks (i.e. reclaim the government's constitutional
money power), got shot, ...
the odds for such leaders don't look so good...
On the other hand, Iceland has jailed at least 26 bankers so far:
so perhaps there's hope... they ousted two full parliaments to get
there though, to full new elections and finally a year(?) long
population-wide new constitution creation which on the face of it
appears to be genuinely by the people themselves, and also clearly
-for- themselves, having rejected any bail-in or bail-out for the
failed commercial private banks that brought that country to its
financial knees.
Seems a genuinely community-based groundswell is needed for genuinely
'good' change, if nothing else...

@_subject: request for comment re "contributor-covenant.org" 
References: Hi cp-ers,
On the PostgreSQL database mailing list pgsql-general at postgresql.org ,
they are discussing a Code of Conduct.
A reference and discussion came up around contributor-covenant.org and
it seems many (allegedly 1000's of "open source projects" have
"adopted" it, and there appears to quite the campaign to "encourage"
the PostgreSQL project to likewise adopt that particular agreement.
The pgsql old hands appear to have rejected it. This is a rare thing
AFAICT. There are a few issues raised about the so-called "contributor
covenant" which have very clearly, and repeatedly, not been responded
to, and this has been pointed out, more than once.
Those who chaperone one or more "open source" project mailing lists
may wish to bring themselves up to speed with this so-called
"covenant" before the steamroller hits your group/ list/ community,
since it seems inevitable at this point.
Being riveted and enraptured by concepts of "enforcement",
"protection" of "the marginalized peoples" and as y'all know, my
raving crusade to further promote "political correctness", I figured I
should go and read this "covenant" to find out what all the fuss might
be about and add some scare quotes at appropriate places.
So I went and read it.
It simply, abso-firetruckingly, demands a response, and beyond what
appears to have currently been tippy toe on eggshells burped out so
Here is my first draft to respond to it, I encourage others to refine
my oh-so-subtle analysis, but most importantly to bring yourself up to
speed with the PC-speak which might freight train into one or more of
your "open source" worlds in the relatively near future; informed
ahead of time may be enough to be armed against long and actually
divisive email discussions, as internet searching sadly tells.
The below is my second woeful attempt to bring some sanity to that
"covenant". It needs your improvements.
Good luck,
Sounds reasonable.
Let's hope free libre and open source software - FLOSS, stays as the foundation
of the Internet!
"social open source networks" - what?? Facebook social network??
Use of new terminology, without explaining that terminology, and
presuming it is known and well understood terminology, in a document
you are pushing as a new and additional "social contract" which others
are pressed upon to adopt and enforce, is IMHO passive aggressive.
Those who have an interest in promoting, assisting, sponsoring and generally
facilitating "the diversity" within this particular libre software
project or mailing list,
are welcome to do so and in general, ought be supported to the extent that their
actions and words are neither actively nor passively aggressive towards any
member of this mailing list, and are actually supportive of the
technical goals of
this project.
Lack of diversity may be viewed as a problem.
Such a viewpoint is a personal, individual matter. Your personal, individual
opinion on this matter may be discussed, but in general is off topic for this
mailing list.
Speaking or writing that "lack of diversity is a problem", and even moreso,
building the presumption into the words of a so-called "social covenant", where
that presumption is almost hidden and "not up for debate", is a passive
aggressive approach to communication with others who may or may not
disagree with this position.
Passive aggressive communication is not welcome on this mailing list.
What is "the very structure of a project"? This phrase is too generic, and not
explained, despite the next part of that sentence which follows below, which

not for you, and if you are in need of any professional help, you are encouraged

and or support.
There are forums and mailing lists which are suitable for those who have
learning difficulties (reference?), for those who need an emotionally sensitive
environment (be sure to check if you need professional medical or
psychological support), and for those who are beginniners in the field of
technology discussed on this mailing list.
In all of these cases, this mailing list is not for you, and you will be
encouraged to leave if we discover that any of these conditions apply to you.
Take note, we heartily welcome the opportunity to joust against your best
attempts to otherwise deceive us in regards to such conditions applying to you,

wasting our time in such circumstances.

You may join this mailing list, but by doing so you agree to speak clearly and
assertively if you feel offended, or otherwise to respectfully leave the mailing

Such communication has no place on this mailing list, except as the target of
naming the presumptions, highlighting the passive aggressive nature and
generally tearing it to shreads and providing an opportunity for the

- >> "Meritocracy naively assumes"
Meritocracy does no such thing - it is not a person.
- >> "Meritocracy also naively assumes a level playing field,"
Meritocracy does no such thing - in fact it is the opposite - meritocracy is a
socio political agreement, contract  and or requirement that participants in the
system shall be judged based on their technical merit and or
performance. In our case, slow performance is entirely acceptable, you
are under no requirement nor expectation to make contributions
according to any schedule, only on your own free time and personal
Making any assertion to the contrary is passive aggressive,
manipulative, and shall be joyously and most light heartedly
attacked in words.
- >> "in which everyone has access to the same resources, free time,"
No such assumptions are made on this mailing list, and quite the contrary
- if you have very little free time for example, or a slow computer, then we
will certainly expect that your contributions may be few and far between
as compared with someone who has loads of free time or a faster computer
than you.
If you are experiencing free time and resources problems, then this list is
DEFINITELY not the place for you - you are explicitly instructed to seek
professional time management advice as well as professional financial
counselling. DO NOT bring such personal problems to this mailing list, as they
will be used as instant grounds for removal and for barring from the
list, although more likely simply as grounds for ridicule and laughing
like hyenas.
- >> "and common life experiences to draw upon."
Once again, "meritocracy" (to the extent we can personify a socio political
system), and "we" the members of this mailing list in particular, make no such
assumptions whatsoever, and we more importantly, put no such requirements upon
So sleep tight, it's all alright, we won't hold your differing life
experiences against you, in fact we may be intrigued, but if a
particular experience you share starts to cause an extended off topic
discussion, take notice that we reserve the right to calmly let you
know this so that we can get back to the topics intended for this
mailing list.
This list may be a platform, but at most only for those robust enough
to hold their own on the topic they make a post about.
If you join this mailing list, you are strongly encouraged to communicate your
personal concerns and problems, needs and requirements at the earliest stage
possible, preferably in in your introduction email with a well
identified subject
Then we will be able to readily assess whether this mailing list is
suitable for you or whether you need to find another, more appropriate
environment in which to express yourself and or to find a "contribution
space" which is suitable for your needs.
If you are unsure, then you are welcome to introduce yourself in this way,
and we will respectfully assess your suitability to the mailing list as best
we can.
Take notice that we are not professionals in any field, indeed we are
amateurs that might be in your personal medical or other interests to
NOT associate with, and that if you require any professional advice,
medical or otherwise, then you are required to seek such advice from
suitably certificated professionals in your area - we on this mailing
list cannot help you in such circumstances and if you fail to inform
us of any such problems and or issues you may have that you consider
we would otherwise be responsible for, then you may be in breech of
the legislation in your jurisdiction - deceive the members of this
mailing list at your own legal liability.
On this mailing list, robust communication is a prime valued
contribution - if you are actively wanting to improve your emotional
robustness, this mailing list could possibly be a suitable place for
you - feel free to ask us about this specifically in relation to you.
If your emotional strength, your social and or communication capacity, and or
your psychological needs are an issue in any way, you are not welcome on this
mailing list and we require you to seek professional medical advice.
If you have any trigger words, emotional weaknesses and or sensitivities which
may cause you to have any reaction whatsoever, you are required to inform the
members of this mailing list in an introduction email if you do join the list,
and if you are required to do so, you must seek professional medical and or
psychological advice and support - this mailing list is most likely an
inappropriate place for you to join, and we continue to encourage ourselves
to not hold back in reminding you this.
You may have some problem, and this mailing list not the place for you to fix
your problem. Only technical matters related to the technical topic of this
mailing list are appropriate problems for fixing in discussions on this
mailing list.
Seek professional advice when you need it, including professional
advice regarding the technical topic of this mailing list if that is what you
require - this mailing list is for non professionals with at least moderate
technical competence, all members are volunteers, all members participate at
their own discretion and with no obligations upon them and with no obligations
whatsoever to you, including courtesy which is valued, but not
required - enter at your own risk.
This we agree with - we, the members of this mailing list, proclaim our
intention to welcome all people to contribute, and to value each member as a
human being. We encourage each other to foster an atmosphere of kindness,
cooperation and understanding, and robustness in communication -
passive aggressive communication, despite the best intentions of the
one making such passive aggressive communication, has no place in our
And take notice - persistent bad behaviour, 'bad' by the assessment of
the members alone and discussed publicly on this mailing list, shall
be cause for temporary and or permanent banning from this mailing
Respect, kindness and cooperation are good things, but this
" "contributor covenant" to which we hereby
respond, is in no way or shape getting into our project's repository without
this our response.
This above paragraph does not quite feel right. If the members of this mailing
list are so anti-social that genuine "social problems" cannot be resolved on the
mailing list itself, then this "community" of members is quite likely beyond
repair without substantial work by robust individuals with a passion to heal the
community - if you are not such an individual, then you best leave that job to
comeone who is, and take yourself to a kinder, gentler happy place.
There may be a time and place for banning members from this mailing list,
temporarily and or permanently, but such discussions shall continue to be
public, on the mailing list itself and open to discussion and
contribution by all members. No duty is incumbent upon any member,
including the "project maintainer" - if the community can't work out
its problems, it is unfair to place such a burden upon such a one
"Marginalized people" who are not competent to contribute on some
technical level (which includes documentation writing, testing as well
as programming), are not welcome - we the members of this mailing list
are volunteers and, on this particular mailing list, are not willing
to tutor those who have special needs - do not join the mailing list
in such circumstances, there are other, appropriate forums, mailing
lists and learning institutions which you ought apply to.
Genuinely anti-social communication is actively discouraged, and this includes
those who communicate deceptively regarding their own needs and or social
environment requirements, as well as those who communicate in a passive
aggressive way. If you this any of these types of communication may apply to
you, then be prepared to suffer the consequences should you join this mailing
list - we shall roast you in words, with glee!
Since the archives of this mailing list are public, should you have even the
smallest concern regarding your own robustness in public communication, then you
are invited to browse those archives and make an assessment as to whether you
are a suitable candidate to join this mailing list. If you do decide to join,
you are required to make your first email an introduction, which introduction
includes a reference to your assessment of the archives as well as any needs you
feel that the members of this list ought be able to meet.
Oh, we've taken the time, and "problems as they emerge" shall be
handled publicly, on this mailing list! To the extent we the members
of this maliing list consider you a problem, passive aggressive or
otherwise, we WILL handle you, publicly, with the one caveat that all
members are in general expected to show respectful consideration in
respect of all private or "off-list" communications.
If you are uncomfortable with this policy, you are encouraged to find a more
suitable community to join.
A "community" that requires any significant policing, particularly
clandestine policing, has lost its way - the tyranny of the majority
is not the healthiest way, in the opinion of some members - speak
clearly, speak the truth, and seek a fair response; if you don't
receive a fair response, another community might be much less work for
you, even if it provides less opportunities for emotional growth for

a committee designated by the core cpers, with an initial proposed CoC
in line with the pg one, in about 3 months, and a final, to be
published in 3 major national US papers to ensure the public gets the

Who's "job" is that? Are you defining this job for someone other than yourself?
These two sentences are approaching incoherent. Would you like to try
again? It is probably not constructive for me to respond to
incoherence - there is perhaps some truth or pain or seeking which has
not been expressed clearly, which I would hope you feel confident
about expressing, or re- attempting to express - such is in our
collective interests.
So say you.
If you wish an intelligent discourse, please put more effort into
explaining this "problem" you assert, describing why you think there
is a problem, etc in a way which others might be able to agree with
you - asserting that something is a problem, in and of itself, says
close to nothing, and is therefore not useful. You might want others
to agree with you that there is a problem, here in this tiny (!!)
corner of the world called the cypherpunks mailing list. You might
even be able to cite coherent facts demonstrating your position - none
of this means I or any other individual has to agree with you, though
some may.
Making you assertion is presently an island waiting for supporters -
nothing more than a political position in search of part members. This
is not the place for such superficiality. I personally seek deeper
Your assertions leave me raising my eyebrows.
And again.
Possible actions based on unsubstantiated presumptions. This -is-
objectionable to me.
You want me to buy in to your political cause? You might consider
presenting a more substantial position, perhaps one based in fact.
This is flame bait. Persistent flame baiting is regarded as trolling.
We share the same hope. For me it is a certainty - I need no hope
about "all being welcome", since it is already a fact.
Your assertions to the contrary notwithstanding...
Is it your position that humans in general have no right to create
communication spaces, semi public as this one is, that fit their
Do you assert that you would like a particular communication space to
exist, which does not currently exist, but which is somehow similar to
cypherpunks mailing list, but perhaps a little different?
If so, have you tried to create such a space?
Or are you simply begrudging this space that has been created not by
you, and not specifically for you (although you are welcome), for some
reasons (perhaps it does not quite meet your expectations?, perhaps
you have taken certain words posted as adversarial to your own actual
intentions to participate?)?
With your assertion of problems existing in this particular space,
without any substantiation of fact, there is not much of a
conversation besides "I want more of something undefined and other
should provide it to me" is there?
Before I turn my own vehemence into another strawman, perhaps
reconsider your presentation/ wording?
Creating spaces in this world that -you- want, is up to you. You may
of course try to enroll others into you intentions, but at the moment,
you might like to work on refining that last bit...
Good luck,

@_subject: Fwd: New High School Principal's speech to students. 
References: <510A847E700D4DD684DDF160ADA31ECB
My kinda speech,
New high school principal
A Speech Every Australian High School Principal Should Give.
To the students and faculty of our high school:
I am your new principal, and honored to be so.
There is no greater calling than to teach young people.
I would like to apprise you of some important changes coming to our school.
I am making these changes because I am convinced that most of the
ideas that have dominated public education in Australia have worked
against you, against your teachers and against our country.
First, this school will no longer honour race or ethnicity.  I could
not care less if your racial makeup is black, brown, red, yellow or
white. I could not care less if your origins are African, Latin
American, Asian or European, or if your ancestors arrived here on the
Endeavour or on slave ships.
The only identity I care about, the only one this school will
recognize, is your individual identity -- your character, your
scholarship, your humanity.
And the only national identity this school will care about is Australia.
This is an Australian public school, and Australian public schools
were created to make better Australians.  If you wish to affirm an
ethnic, racial or religious identity through school, you will have to
go elsewhere.   We will end all ethnicity, race and non-Australian
nationality-based celebrations.  They undermine the motto of
Australia, one of its three central values -- epluribus Unum, "from
many, one."  And this school will be guided by Australia's values.
This includes all after-school clubs.  I will not authorize clubs that
divide students based on any identities.   This includes race,
language, religion, sexual orientation or whatever else may become in
vogue in a society divided by political correctness.
Your clubs will be based on interests and passions, not blood, ethnic,
racial or other physically defined ties.
Those clubs just cultivate narcissism -- an unhealthy preoccupation
with the self -- while the purpose of education is to get you to think
beyond yourself.
So we will have clubs that transport you to the wonders and glories of
art, music, astronomy, languages you do not already speak, carpentry
and more.
If the only extracurricular activities you can imagine being
interested in are those based on ethnic, racial or sexual identity,
that means that little outside of yourself really interests you.
Second, I am uninterested in whether English is your native language.
My only interest in terms of language is that you leave this school
speaking and writing English as fluently as possible.
The English language has united Australia's citizens for over 200
years, and it will unite us at this school.   It is one of the
indispensable reasons this country of immigrants has always come to be
one country.  And if you leave this school without excellent English
language skills, I would be remiss in my duty to ensure that you will
be prepared to successfully compete in the Australian job market.
We will learn other languages here -- it is deplorable that most
Australians only speak English -- but if you want classes taught in
your native language rather than in English,this is not your school.
Third, because I regard learning as a sacred endeavour, everything in
this school will reflect learning's elevated status.
This means, among other things, that you and your teachers will dress
Many people in our society dress more formally for Horse Racing events
than for church or school. These people have their priorities
backward. Therefore, there will be a formal dress code at this school.
Fourth, no obscene language will be tolerated anywhere on this
school's property -- whether in class, in the hallways or at athletic
events. If you can't speak without using the f -word, you can't speak.
By obscene language I mean the words banned by the Federal
Communications Commission, plus epithets such as "Abbo," even when
used by one black student to address another black, or "bitch," even
when addressed by a girl to a girlfriend. It is my intent that by the
time you leave this school, you will be among the few your age to
instinctively distinguish between the elevated and the degraded, the
holy and the obscene.
Fifth, we will end all self-esteem programs. In this school,
self-esteem will be attained in only one way -- the way people
attained it until decided otherwise a generation ago -- by earning it.
  One immediate consequence is that there will be one valedictorian,
not eight.
Sixth, and last, I am reorienting the school toward academics and away
from politics and propaganda.  No more time will be devoted to scaring
you about smoking and caffeine, or terrifying you about sexual
harassment or global warming.
No more semesters will be devoted to condom wearing and teaching you
to regard sexual relations as only or primarily a health issue..
There will be no more attempts to convince you that you are a victim
because you are not white, or not male, or not heterosexual or not
We will have failed if any one of you graduates this school and does
not consider him or herself inordinately fortunate -- to be alive and
to be an Australian.
Now, please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag
of our country.
As many of you do not know the words, your teachers will hand them out to you.

Guilty as charged dear Cecilia.
Well, you just did - Yay Crocodilo PONIES!!!!  :D
The number of crimes being committed by American govt and its organs
(CIA, NSA, five eyes, FBI, private corporations running their jails,
their diplomats, their banking cartels, their MIC, their corporations,
their "rendition", their illegal unlawful unethical prison
jurisdictions, their ...)
is almost beyond belief.
The hegemon "America" is out of control and perpetrating evil on a scale
the world finds difficult to even grasp, and regular Americans seem to
be in a lot of denial about the depth, breadth, intensity and
persistence through time of the wrongs their government continues to
perpetrate in their name.
Blindness to the problems, or doing nothing to fix the problems, is
called acquiescence, and is also called tacit consent - i.e. Americans
who are not opposing their government, are by default (tacitly)
consenting to the evil perpetrated in their name.
I am in vigorous and persistent proclamation of the evils being
perpetrated by the idiots in my Australian government. I continue to
participate, decade in and out, in grass roots groups who make steps to
fix some of these problems. As best as I am capable.
Many Aussies I've come across are very complacent, comfortable and to be
honest, apathetic. We are such a young country, immature in many ways
from "ooh you're not yet 18 you mustn't touch a drop of alcohol, even
though we know this leads to Aussies being some of the greatest binge
drinkers in the world" to our population-wide immaturity around
relationships and sexuality (second only to America it seems), to our
bloody idiot politicians like Tony Abbot (previous prime minister)
publicly saying he will "shirt front" (bounce his chest against, in
order to topple over) the Russian president Putin (yes it wouldn't
really happen, but shit, how firetrucking immature can we Aussies be?
We're a bloody embarrassment to the world!!!)
We Australians "punch way above our weight category" on an international
level, in many forums - mostly sport, but also science and computing and
business, and we have a steady parade of actors who make it to
Hollywood. We can be rightfully proud of our limited cultural,
scientific and humanitarian achievements and I don't deny this to my
fellow Australians.
Yet the reality is, we can do SO much better, and we have many problems,
and evils being perpetrated and perpetuated in our name, which we
absolutely MUST fix up/ stop!
Australians need to grow the f! up!
I agree. But the USA government is most definitely not a regional
problem. It is a military, financial and political hegemon. And it is
perpetrating murder, democratic goverment overthrows, coups, war,
torture, "cultural export", and basically worldwide thuggery in the name
of some bullshit ideology of "democracy".
This is a very great evil, being done by America, and supported by many
Western countries such as Australia, Germany, France, the UK and plenty
of other me-toos.
We must not fail to do everything we can to name the World's Greatest
Problem today, to educate people about this problem, and to work towards
something less problematic.
THIS is why I will never let up on America - not until they stop
murdering and torturing and overthrowing peoples all around the world,
in the name of "Democracy" or whatever the firetruck ideology they want
to pretend to be "promoting" with these techniques (murder, torture,
overthrow, etc).
At the moment, the consequences are quite different.
I am confident, seeing the actions of current Russian govt lead by
Putin, so much restraint in the face of so much Western provocations,
for so many years, that Putin will continue to cause Russia to act
conservatively and towards a multi polar (politically) world. He will
win the next election, his popularity guarantees that, which means
another 7 to 8 years for him, and for the world for which I am very
Next Russian president, of course I cannot predict. But Putin, yes I can
confidently continue to predict, as his personal record is
unimpeachable - every country could be extremely proud.
I really really hope that the next Russian president after Putin (in
about 7 years time from now) will reach at least half the standard of
Putin in leading Russia.
Remember, the 10 to 15% of Russians who disapprove of Putin, think he is
much too soft against the West's provocations... this is a very serious
point. Soros and the Neocons wanted to provoke significant reactions
from Russia, and they did not get it, so they have no excuse to raise
WWII (not yet anyway) - how can I be anything other than EXTEREMELY
grateful to Putin and those in the current Russian parliament who
support him?
We should all be grateful for the current situation in Russia - there is
absolutely no comparison to America's actions on the international
stage, AT this point in time in history.
I hope my passionate reply is ok :)
Cecilia, thank you so very much for your speaking from your heart. You
do speak important truth which I support. It is very good for us to
focus on the love that individual humans bring to this world. I hope
that more and more love can go into actions which bring the governments
of the world into more alignment with what is good and healing for this
world and its people.
I think we share very similar hopes for the future...
Have a wonderful day,

I think his key point here is that we must not be in self delusion.
It is ok to dream. Cypherpunk dream is a great dream. A dream of
freedom, hope, for everyone.
But when we are in a denial of a particular problem, or speaking as
though a particular limitation does not exist, or a particular piece of
software provides some guarantee which it does NOT provide - then not
only are we deluding ourselves, but (and I see this as a pain for Juan)
we are leading others astray.
This is why over and over, when the facts don't support an assumption,
especially when that assumption could endanger life and or liberty of
someone trying to do some good (e.g. a whistleblower), then how can we
say anything but support for Juan's outspoken vehemence?
Juan says "I will not compromise the safety of a fellow fighter no
matter what", and he sacrifices the appearance of civility to try to
achieve this - to try to support our brothers who want to fight, who
want to whistleblow, who want to undermine the murderers in our world.
Leading potential fighters astray in their thinking is essentially
unforgiveable - which is why I am bound by my own conscience to always
say "Juan, thank you! So few speak up as much as you do, for those who
genuinely need someone to speak up for them!"
How can we let down our brothers so much?
Yes, speak our dreams, our hopes! But do so honestly!
"Positive thinking" is not about deceiving ourselves or those who read
our proclamations on crypto anarchist software. And in fact it's quite
the opposite as I hope is clear by now - let's get off the hippy flower
power "positive speaking will magically manifest secure anonymising
software" bullshit bandwagon, and speak bluntly, plainly, and clearly so
onlookers are NEVER deceived!
Surely this is the LEAST we can do for our potential future brothers in
punk land?!

@_subject: using gnupg with mutt 
Does anyone know how to have an automatic association between a pgp
public key and a 'specified by me' email address?
As in, some people create gpg keys which do not include their email
address, and I would have thought it trivial for me, in my own keyring,
to associate a public key I have received, with one or more email
addresses of my choosing (and / or the person's name, as fair as I know
the name etc).
gpg --edit-key HASH
brings up a prompt, and help gives things like trust and list, and there
is a "notation" sub command which sounds perfect for the job, but can
only operate on private keys, not public keys.
This all does not make sense to me. When someone sends me an email,
signed with their private key, and I get a copy of their public key, I
should be able to associate their public key, with their email address,
even if their own signing of their pub/sub public key does not include
that particular (or any) email address.
What gives?

Problem is, most religions have bits about love thy neighbour, but also
how here and there "God" calls upon "his" "subjects" to sacrifice a son
for example, or to "cut off the head of the unbelievers [of this
particular religion]" for example.
So perhaps "every religion" has some proclamation to love thy neighbour,
I don't know, cannot vouch for that, but this is not enough to make an
assessment of a religion and whether those who subscribe to that
particular dogma are likely or not to kill me, and or my family, and or
my friends.
Even if a religion is "the religion of peace" or says "love thy
neighbour" does not mean there are not other beliefs written in that
religion's holy books, which call upon the believers to commit evil
Yes it's good to focus on the love.
But for survival, sometimes we must focus on the evil, just so much so
that we can protect ourselves. If we don't do this, we are in denial of
reality of religions, and also, sadly, of humans..
Yes, from an artistic point of view, exploding a city could be seen as a
"beautiful thing".
I won't use those terms together in that way, and I think doing so often
causes conversational contention of no benefit. Contention can be
useful, but not when we end up disputing "artistic" or "obviously
fallacious" points...
This is very useful type of communication. No point we waste time
running down rabbit holes for no benefit :)

Run your own server, preferably at home. Provide a web frontend. Have
those people who you need secure communication with sign up for a fancy
new email account, on your server.
Only send email to their email account on your server.
If it's really really important, block their email account from sending
email outside your server - they can still download attachments, but
they can't "make an easy mistake" since they have to be intentional.
If you provide POP or IMAP access, only allow encrypted access.
If your contacts use the web interface, and you -really- want "security"
(to the level you are confident in your own server at least), then issue
your own Certificate Authority and server Certificate, and meet your
contacts in person, manually installing your server certificate into
their browser certificate directory!
NEVER trust ANY external Certificate Authority for any server or
communications that is highly sensitive!
Feel el1te!!!
If it's on a phone or fax, or in front of a Samsung TV, or near any land
line phone that's been certified by your national telecommunications
authority, or in a public WIFI cafe which is likely bugged, or near any
mobile phones that are switched on, or .... etc ... then assume your
conversation is property of your national government and most likely the
"five eyes" (USA, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Germany).
Use a chat application which provides PFS/ perfect forward secrecy, and
allows transfer of files - that's another approach. There are plenty

References: We present several novel techniques to track (unassociated)
mobile devices by abusing features of the Wi-Fi standard.
This shows that using random MAC addresses, on its own,
does not guarantee privacy.
First, we show that information elements in probe requests
can be used to fingerprint devices. We then combine these
fingerprints with incremental sequence numbers, to create
a tracking algorithm that does not rely on unique identi-
fiers such as MAC addresses. Based on real-world datasets,
we demonstrate that our algorithm can correctly track as
much as 50% of devices for at least 20 minutes. We also
show that commodity Wi-Fi devices use predictable scram-
bler seeds. These can be used to improve the performance of
our tracking algorithm. Finally, we present two attacks that
reveal the real MAC address of a device, even if MAC ad-
dress randomization is used. In the first one, we create fake
hotspots to induce clients to connect using their real MAC
address. The second technique relies on the new 802.11u
standard, commonly referred to as Hotspot 2.0, where we
show that Linux and Windows send Access Network Query
Protocol (ANQP) requests using their real MAC address.
Sad state of "security" in the world today.
We know we need open source -everything-, including network
stacks, firmware, and even chip/ hardware designs, not to
mention manufacturing to end user chain of physical trust..

"Always and everywhere, when the masses are restless, even the most
enthusiastic liberals immediately reverse themselves and become the most
fanatical champions of the omnipotence of the State."
I take exception to the historical absolute assertion "(They
["Liberals"] know very well that no state in history has ever been
created by contract, and that all states were established by conquest
and violence.)", in that around 1900, the Commonwealth of Australia, the
federation of various states including New South Wales, Queensland,
Victoria etc, was created by referendum and consent of the British
parliament and the British monarchy, and not "by conquest and violence"
even though it is true that the majority of states ("countries") in
existence were created by conquest and violence.
New Zealand and Canada and perhaps other Commonwealth states, I think
share similar non violent histories, though I am no historian, so please
do your own research if important.
Setting aside this historical exception to the "conquest and violence"
rule about the creation of states, the paper gives much to think and
debate about.
"Under the aspect of their earthly existence, the mass of men present so
sorry and degrading a spectacle, so poor in spirit, in will and
initiative, that one must be endowed with a truly great capacity for
self — delusion, to detect in them an immortal soul, or even the
faintest trace of free will."

America’s Permanent Wars on the World
"Since 1945, America’s Manifest Destiny, posing as the Free World’s
Crusade against the Red Menace, has claimed 20 to 30 million lives
worldwide and bombed one-third of the earth’s people."
Luciana Bohne
Can we face it in this election season? America is a weapons factory,
the White House a war room, and the president the manager of the
neoliberal conspiracy to recolonize the planet. It exports war and mass
poverty. On the economic front, usurious neoliberalism; on the military
front, illegal wars. These are the trenches of America’s battle for
world domination in the 21st century.
If not stopped, it will be a short century.
Since 1945, America’s Manifest Destiny, posing as the Free World’s
Crusade against the Red Menace, has claimed 20 to 30 million lives
worldwide and bombed one-third of the earth’s people. In the
19thcentury, America exterminated another kind of “red menace,” writing
and shredding treaties, stealing lands, massacring, and herding Native
populations into concentration camps (“Indian reservations”), in the
name of civilizing the “savages.” By 1890, with the massacre of Lakota
at Wounded Knee, the frontier land grab—internal imperialism– was over.
There was a world to conquer, and America trained its exceptionally
covetous eye on Cuba and the Philippines.
American external imperialism was born.
Then, something utterly dreadful happened in 1917—a successful social
revolution in Russia, the second major after the French in 1789, to try
to redistribute the wealth of the few to the advantage of the many. The
rulers of the world—US, Britain, France and sundry acolytes—put aside
their differences and united to stem the awful threat of popular
democracy rising and spreading. They invaded Russia, fomented a civil
war, funding and arming the counter-revolutionary forces, failed, and
tried again in 1939. But Hitler’s war of extermination on the USSR ended
in a spectacular victory for Moscow.
For a while, after 1945, the US had to behave as a civilized country,
formally. It claimed that the USSR had a barbarian, all-conquering
ideology, rooted in terror, disappearances, murder, and torture. By
contrast, the US was the shining city on the hill, the beacon of hope
for a “the free world.” Its shrine was the United Nations; its holy writ
was international law; its first principle was the inviolability of the
sovereignty of nations.
All this was rubbish, of course. It was an apartheid society. It nuked
Japan not once but twice, deliberately selecting civilian targets. It
shielded from justice top Nazi criminals to absorb them as partners in
intelligence structures. It conducted virtual “show trials” against
dissidents during the hysteria of the McCarthy congressional hearings,
seeding the country with a harvest of fear. It waged a genocidal war on
Vietnam to prevent independence and unification. It assassinated African
independence leaders and bestowed fascist dictators on Latin America. It
softly occupied Western Europe, tied it to itself through military
“cooperation” in NATO, and it waged psy-op war on its opposition
parties. Behind the civilized façade was a ruthless effort to take out
the Soviet Union and crush self-determination in the colonial world.
By hook and by crook, the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, and America
went berserk with triumphalism. Now, at last, the conquest of the world,
interrupted in 1917, could resume. The global frontier reopened and
America’s identity would be regenerated through violence, which had
delivered the American West to the European invaders in the 19th
century. The benign mask dropped. Behind it came a rider on a pale
horse. According to the ideologically exulted, history had ended,
ideologies had died, and the messianic mission of the US to become the
steward of God’s property on earth could be fulfilled.
The “civilizing mission” was afoot.A cabal of neo-conservative policy
wonks first sketched what I call the Great Leap Backward into
lawlessness as a revival of the myth of the frontier in the 1990s. “The
Plan for a New American Century” (PNAC) envisaged the 21st century as a
unilateralist drive to entrench American values globally—what the PNAC
ideologues call “freedom and democracy”—through preemptive wars and
regime change. This frenzied delirium of US military domination turned
into official foreign policy with the Bush Doctrine after 9/11, but it
was the Clinton administration’s Doctrine of Humanitarian Warfare before
9/11, that shut the door on the prohibition of aggressive wars by the UN
Charter, remaking the map of the world into a borderless American
hunting reserve by removing the principle of sovereignty and replacing
it with “right to protect” (R2P)—or humanitarian pretext for use of
Clinton’s doctrine was an act of supreme, even witty, exploitation of
liberal principles and commitment to policies of human rights. It was
how the liberal left was induced to embrace war and imperialism as the
means of defending human rights. The Carnegie Endowment cooked up the
doctrine in 1992. Its report, “Changing Our Ways: America’s Role in the
New World,” urged “a new principle of international relations: the
destruction or displacement of groups of people within states can
justify international intervention.” The report recommended that the US
use NATO as the enforcer. It must be noted, too, that the principle of
“humanitarian war” has no authority in international law. The Charter of
the United Nations sought to outlaw war by making it impossible for
unilateral interventions in the business of sovereign states by
self-appointed guardians of human rights. The reason behind the
proscription was not heartlessness but the consciousness that WW II had
been the result of serial violations of sovereignty by Germany, Italy,
and Japan—by militarist imperialism, in other words.
The bell tolled for the UN and the old order in the 1999 Kosovo War. The
bi-partisan effort to dismantle the architecture of the post war’s legal
order played out there. With the Kosovo War, the Clinton administration
launched the first humanitarian war and set the precedent for waging war
without Security Council clearance of many to follow by both Republican
and Democrat administrations. The Clintonites who used NATO to bomb
Serbia to protect ethnic Albanians in Kosovo from non-existing Serbian
genocide may or may not have appreciated the fact that Hitler had used
the pretext of R2P—humanitarian intervention—to launch WW II by claiming
to protect German minorities in Poland, but they certainly knew that the
monopoly on use of force rested with the UN’s Security Council. This
monopoly was secured after WW II precisely to prevent unilateral attacks
on sovereign states through bogus claims of altruistic interventions,
such as Hitler had championed and pursued. Ironically for critics of the
Soviet leader, it was Stalin who insisted at the Yalta Conference that
if the USSR were to join the United Nations a veto in the Security
Council was a must to insure that any war would be a multilateral
consensus and a multilateral action.
As the Clintonites understood, the postwar legal authority for
peacekeeping and the prevention of war entrusted to the UN Security
Council posed a colossal obstacle to the pursuit of American world
domination. For the vision of PNAC and the Carnegie Endowment to become
reality, the United Nations, the guarantor of sovereignty, had to go. In
the run-up to the Kosovo War, the Clintonites fatally and deliberately
destabilized the United Nations, substituting the uncooperative UN
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali with the subservient NATO shill,
Kofi Annan. Annan obligingly opined that in the matter of war and peace,
UN Security Council resolutions were not the only way to skin a country–
especially one chosen by the US for remaking, partitioning, or regime
changing, a cynic might add.
So now we live in a dangerous world. Once again, since the 1930s, the
world is being stalked by an expansionist power answering to no law but
its own unilateral, humanitarian vigilantism. The Kosovo precedent has
spun out of control. Libya smolders in the ashes of NATO bombs, dropped
to prevent “genocide”; Syria fights for survival under attack by
genocidal terrorist groups, armed, trained and funded by genocide
preventers grouped in the NATO alliance and the Gulf partners;
Afghanistan languishes in a permanent state of war, present ten thousand
American troops which bomb hospitals to promote human rights; in Iraq,
the humanitarians are back, after twenty-five years of humanitarian
failure. And in Ukraine, Nazi patriots are promoting American democratic
and humanitarian values by shelling Donbass daily. I hesitate to mention
Africa, where humanitarian Special Forces are watering the fields where
terrorists sprout like mushrooms after rain—in Mali, Nigeria, Somalia,
Then there is Yemen, perhaps the most callous, vicious, and careless
humanitarian crime of a litany of crimes against humanity in the Middle
East. The US government has recently admitted deploying troops to Yemen.
The Pentagon claims that the deployment will assist Saudi Arabia (“the
Arab coalition”) to fight al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula. Can a sentient
being meet such a grotesque claim with anything but infernal laughter?
Help Saudi Arabia to fight its own creature? Are we stupid yet?
$4 trillion dollars later, spent on the War-on-Terror/Humanitarian-R2P,
the pattern of military destabilization of sovereign states proceeds
apace, one recalcitrant, independent country at a time in the Middle
East and North Africa. For the rest of the world, the surrender of
sovereignty is sought by means of economic globalization through trade
pacts—TTP, TTIP, etc.—that virtually abolish the constitution of states,
including our own. Spearheading the economic effort to control the
periphery and the entire world is the so-called “Washington Consensus.”
It hugs the market-fundamentalist idea that global neoliberalism and
core finance capital’s economic control of the planet by means of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO)
is the option to poverty and social chaos.
Neither military nor economic war on the sovereignty of nations has
yielded anything close to a stable, prosperous, and peaceful world. It
had delivered death, destruction, debt, market crises, tidal waves of
refugees and displaced persons, and concentrated masses of wealth in a
few but powerful hands. What the poet W.H. Auden called “the
international wrong,” which he named “imperialism” in his poem
“September 1939,” is the crisis that stares out of the mirror of the
past into our faces, and it bodes war, war, and more war, for that is
where imperialism drives.
In this scenario, no potential presidential candidate—even
establishment-party dissenter—who does not call for both the end of the
bi-partisan “Washington Consensus” and the end of bipartisan militarist
aggression can reverse the totality of the “international wrong” or stem
the domestic descent into social brutalization. If none calls this
foreign policy debacle “imperialism,” elections will be a sleepwalker’s
exercise. Nothing will change. Except, almost certainly, for the worse.

they can create a "Governable coalition" - ironic given that in our

One land mass can be the place for more than one change in national
The point is, America had a revolutionary war to "free" themselves from
Great Britain, whereas by the time the colonies of Australasia decided
to secede, the Crown allowed for most powers going to the new country
Australia, without any civil war, just a referendum.
So, there is precedent for creation of a new state (country) by
secession and referendum, rather than conquest and/ or war.
This precedent, although benefitting mainly just the "landed gentry"
(land owners), is still something we can view with significant regard as
a better way than civil war.
Today's Ukraine shows us a classic case of the two examples: Crimea
managed to get support from Russia for a referendum and voted almost
unanimously for secession, which Russia duly recognised. The Donbass
however, were not granted this option and instead must continue to fight
for their lives against the Ukro-Nazis from the West who would rather
kill ever Russian speaking Ukrainian they can get their hands on - the
ongoing war there is an absolute disgrace to Europe, France, Germany, UK
and the rest of the Western regime's cabal who supported the overthrow
of Ukraine (for the n'th time), and refused to demand that the new
(Nazi-fied) government stop killing its own citizens in the East who
want at least a federalization (like we have in Australia, and I believe
is not too dissimilar to the North American United States).
Instead all we get is endless repetition of the western MSM meme "Russia
illegally annexed Crimea".
That's called bullshit word manipulation! If "illegal annexation" is all
it was, then the citizens of Crimea are massively grateful for that
"illegal annexation" and the citizens of the Donbass/ Novorossia sadly
pine for the day they are not longer shelled, bombed and shot on a daily

Considering George Friedman, president of STRATFOR's “really the most
blatant coup in history.” (
), does the new/coup government of the "sovereign" state of Ukraine,
continue "legally" as the same sovereign?
Once the "democratically" ('normal' by OSCE assessments) elected
pre-"Maidan coup" government of Ukraine was overthrown, non
democratically, by United States of America government intentions and
actions, does the "sovereign" "state of Ukraine" even exist any more,
Is it fair to say that the people of Crimea, voting at referendum,
witnessing/ hearing of busloads of fellow Russian-speakers being
murdered, brutalised and shot, essentially an internal civil war taking
place, is it fair to say that when they (after the 5th or so request
over many years) finally got consent and support from 'mother' Russia to
help them run a referendum without being further shot, brutalised etc as
was happening in other parts of Ukraine, they run their referendum, and
then we say it was "just noise" or "illegal"?
Such a position I just don't get and obviously cannot agree with...

I suspect not, but in the context, I think that would literally have
been suicide. Or endless civil war as we see since then (the last two
years) in eastern Ukraine.
Supported by themselves?
Again, I think contextually, they sought the support of mother Russia -
we humans crave the perceived (correctly or incorrectly) safety of our
'parent' nation state. See subject.
May be so, and some reports that the Crimean parliament reps were
'encouraged' to vote for secession, but that's a miniscule percentage of
the population.
The Crimean population, who now have overwhelming gratitude for the
"polite green men" who kept them safe from the Nazi Banderites who
wanted to bring their "peace train" to Crimea - I assume you've seen
-that- particular documentary - the voice of the Crimean average person
appears to be strong, consistent, and certainly not "coerced" in any way
by 'mother Russia'. As I see it, they were in genuine fear for their
lives, families, homes and stability of "state", and as such it is no
wonder to me that they voted overwhelmingly for secession from the new
'illegitimate' at that point in time "sovereign Ukraine". They tried
(asked Russia for support for such a referendum) numerous times in the
past, and were rejected every prior time.
In fact, in the actual context of that point in time, it is in hindsight
inconceivable that the people of Crimea would -not- have voted
significantly for the protection of union with Russia - most of them are
Russian after all, Ukraine was a very artificial 'state' created by the
USSR at the height of its empire, when it would have been almost
impossible to imagine the breakup of the USSR.
And that internal war of the new Ukraine govt against its own people in
the Donbass, still goes on, and Europe still turns a blind eye, not
wanting to legitimize "federalist" secession tendencies in Europe, and
irrationally wanting to keep 'pressure' on Russia for its multi polar
intentions. Shows how 'democratic' the "West" is...
Don't know that history yet - but we're talking here of course about the
recent annexation, not that original one. Notwithstanding, there is
interesting history for what it's worth:
Count Alexander Bezborodko, then a close advisor to the Empress, wrote
in his diary that Russia was "forced" to annex Crimea:
    The Porte has not kept good faith from the very beginning. Their
primary goal has been to deprive the Crimeans of independence. They
banished the legal khan and replaced him with the thief Devlet Giray.
They consistently refused to evacuate the Taman. They made numerous
perfidious attempts to introduce rebellion in the Crimea against the
legitimate Khan Şahin Giray (Sahin Giray). All of these efforts did not
bring us to declare war... …The Porte never ceased to drink in each drop
of revolt among the Tatars... …Our only wish has been to bring peace to
Crimea…and we were finally forced by the Turks to annex the area.[14]

"Invasion" of Crimea by Russia in 2014? Please!
If the actions of Russia in the face of the Azov battalian's "peace
train" to Crimea, a referendum, secession and joining to Russia, without
a single bullet fired, is supposed to be a "Russian invasion", then the
world does not have much to worry about with Russia.
I guess it would also be "assumed fact" that Russia continues, for over
2 years, to "invade" eastern Ukraine/ Donbass - I tell you this, if I
had family living in Donbass who would struggle to defend themselves
against various Ukraine "battallians", to defend their families,
children, houses, friends, I would most likely have been fighting with
them to help them defend the rest of my family, their house, friends
ISIS invades Syria, entering from Iraq, Turkey and other surrounding
areas, provided weapons and training by CIA, and takes over towns and
cities; THAT is an invasion.
As it is, we in the West can sit back so comfortably, armchair war
generals, declare with the CIA that Al Nusra, Daesh and other Wahabbi
extremists entering/invading Syria are actually "freedom fighters" as
they invade towns and cities, raping, killing and destroying, because,
you know "Assad must go", whilst those families defending themselves and
their houses in eastern Ukraine against their own supposed "government"
are "terrorists".

By the way, it ought be obvious to any thinking mind, but if Russia
chose to actually invade Ukraine and risk the big confront with America
and WWIII, it would have seized Ukraine's capital Kiev in about 48 hours
- less time than it would take the US to actually get its shit in order
to respond and ship over many battallians of various forces (which is,
truly, what the war hawks want the excuse to do - to be "the
policeman of the world").
The conclusion AFAICT on both sides (USA and Russia) seems to be that,
assuming no nuclear armageddon, a regular ground/air war would proceed
for a few months and America would likely reclaim Ukraine from such an
aggressive Russia, but Russia would exact a very high toll as the price
for "Western freedom".
Fortunately, this did not happen.
(And in that hypothetical, the Ukrainians would have experienced a hell
far greater, far more devastating, far more intense, and over a much
shorter time frame, than they have ever experienced (as f@ up as it
is) over the last two years of civil war.)

Hugh Fitzgerald: Switzerland: What’s in a Handshake?
JIHAD WATCH
By Hugh Fitzgerald
May 27, 2016 12:12 pm 117 Comments Sometimes it’s the little things that are most telling. In Switzerland
it has long been customary for students to shake the hands of their
teachers at the beginning and end of the school day. It’s a sign of
solidarity and mutual respect between teacher and pupil, one that is
thought to encourage the right classroom atmosphere. Justice Minister
Simonetta Sommaruga recently felt compelled to further explain that
shaking hands was part of Swiss culture and daily life.
And the reason she felt compelled to speak out about the handshake is
that two Muslim brothers, aged 14 and 15, who have lived in Switzerland
for several years (and thus are familiar with its mores), in the town of
Therwil, near Basel, refused to shake the hands of their teacher, a
woman, because, they claimed, this would violate Muslim teachings that
contact with the opposite sex is allowed only with family members. At
first the school authorities decided to avoid trouble, and initially
granted the boys an exemption from having to shake the hand of any
female teacher. But an uproar followed, as Mayor Reto Wolf explained to
the BBC: “the community was unhappy with the decision taken by the
school. In our culture and in our way of communication a handshake is
normal and sends out respect for the other person, and this has to be
brought [home] to the children in school.”
Therwil’s Educational Department reversed the school’s decision,
explaining in a statement on May 25 that the school’s exemption was
lifted because “the public interest with respect to equality between men
and women and the integration of foreigners significantly outweighs the
freedom of religion.” It added that a teacher has the right to demand a
handshake. Furthermore, if the students refused to shake hands again
“the sanctions called for by law will be applied,” which included a
possible fine of up to 5,000 dollars.
This uproar in Switzerland, where many people were enraged at the
original exemption granted to the Muslim boys, did not end after that
exemption was itself overturned by the local Educational Department. The
Swiss understood quite clearly that this was more than a little quarrel
over handshakes; it was a fight over whether the Swiss would be masters
in their own house, or whether they would be forced to yield, by the
granting of special treatment, to the Islamic view of the proper
relations between the sexes. It is one battle – small but to the Swiss
significant – between o’erweening Muslim immigrants and the indigenous
Naturally, once the exemption was withdrawn, all hell broke loose among
Muslims in Switzerland. The Islamic Central Council of Switzerland,
instead of yielding quietly to the Swiss decision to uphold the
handshaking custom, criticized the ruling in hysterical terms, claiming
that the enforcement of the handshaking is “totalitarian” (!) because
its intent is to “forbid religious people from meeting their obligations
to God.” That, of course, was never the “intent” of the long-standing
handshaking custom, which was a nearly-universal custom in Switzerland,
and in schools had to do only with encouraging the right classroom
atmosphere of mutual respect between instructor and pupil, of which the
handshake was one aspect. The Swiss formulation of the problem –
weighing competing claims — will be familiar to Americans versed in
Constitutional adjudication. In this case “the public interest with
respect to equality” of the sexes and the “integration of foreigners”
(who are expected to adopt Swiss ways, not force the Swiss to exempt
them from some of those ways) were weighed against the “religious
obligations to God” of Muslims, and the former interests found to
outweigh the latter.
What this case shows is that even at the smallest and seemingly
inconsequential level, Muslims are challenging the laws and customs of
the Infidels among whom they have been allowed to settle. Each little
victory, or defeat, will determine whether Muslims will truly integrate
into a Western society or, instead, refashion that society to meet
Muslim requirements. The handshake has been upheld and, what’s more, a
stiff fine now will be imposed on those who continue to refuse to shake
hands with a female teacher. This is a heartening sign of non-surrender
by the Swiss. But the challenges of the Muslims within Europe to the
laws and customs of the indigenes have no logical end and will not stop.
And the greater the number of Muslims allowed to settle in Europe, the
stronger and more frequent their challenges will be. They are attempting
not to integrate, but rather to create, for now, a second, parallel
society, and eventually, through sheer force of numbers from both
migration and by outbreeding the Infidels, to fashion not a parallel
society but one society — now dominated by Muslims.
The Swiss handshaking dispute has received some, but not enough, press
attention. Presumably, it’s deemed too inconsequential a matter to
bother with. But the Swiss know better. And so should we.
There’s an old Scottish saying that in one variant reads: “Many a little
makes a mickle.” That is, the accumulation of many little things leads
to one big thing. That’s what’s happening in Europe today. This was one
victory for the side of sanity. There will need to be a great many more.

the Muslim Brotherhood.
if you want to consider whether the people of Syria are for or against
their government and their President, just consider this: Syria has a
population of 23 million people. It is in the sixth year of a war in
which it has been opposed by the United States, Great Britain, France,
NATO, the European Union,...
Where have we [USA] come?! What has come of this country?!
Extremely reckless, nearly an insane American policy, driven by Saudi
wealth that lines the pockets of top people in this country. It’s sad.

There is a phrase, and you can pretend I said this immortal quote but
it would not be the case that I originated it:
"One man can change the world."
A man who stands on principle can be many things which can change a
particular "world" (if not the world at large):
 - the canary in the mine whistleblower, e.g. "keeping the TOR bastards
   honest" and thus causing a lot of angst for those who wanted to use
   Tor for their state-sponsored human-subversive intentions
 - the sole individual who facilitates/ is the conduit for key
   transmissions of whistleblowers and their information, to a publisher
   who has infrastructure to publish bypassing national "intelligence
   networks" - e.g. to connect a Chelsie Manning to a Julian Assange.
Remember - there was (perhaps still is, we don't know because it's so
top secretive) a grand jury out to hang draw and quarter Julian Assange,
an Australian - I think Australia has an extradition treaty with USA, we
certainly host Pine Gap which is a global hub for the USA/ five eyes.
HUGE resources have been put into this case against Julian
- plane flights
- enrollement of foreign so-called "sovereign" governments such as
  UK, Sweden, Australia
- subversion of the Swedish justice department
- unilaterally grounding the aeroplane of the president of Ecuador
- and probably plenty more behind the scenes which we are not aware of
  publicly.
THIS IS F@ HUGE!!!
The USA/CIA/FBI/NorthAmerican Government wants Julian Assange really,
really badly!
things which embarrass the North American establishment oligarchs -
Hitlery emails, banking scandals, war files and plenty more.
Wikileaks (with all its problems which around these parts some are aware
of) is a MASSIVE thorn in the side of the Empire of the North American
and Atlantic Regime.
Jacob Applebaum was a key figure facilitating the conduit of leakers to
Assange, and, apparently, certainly quite possibly, keeping the bastards
honest at Tor Inc, which was supposed to be an American Military and CIA
operation - and here was this pipsqueak Jacob taking the "published
principles of an intention (however weakly implemented) toward aiding
public anonymity of transmission of information", literally!
Jacob Applebaum took that fucking intention fucking literally!
The fucking hide of him!!!
How DARE anyone take principled intentions literally, ESPECIALLY when
the neoc9nt American establishment is paying for it.
FFS, Wake UP!
Well that certainly demonstrates the principled actions of a principled
North American Incorporation spreading the principles of Democracy,
Transparency, Liberty of information, and the Rule of Law, now doesn't
Read his words. Read his interviews. He was being actively stalked and
monitored by The Powers That Be, and he became aware of this, realised
he needed to do more of the op-sec he was teaching whistleblowers how to
do, his op sec was far above what most of us ever approach. Jacob was
not able to live a "normal" life.
Perhaps he was grateful for the opportunity to bow out? IDK, just
postulating of course, but hell, if he really was the only man truly
standing in the gaggle of self interested, intensely feminazi and pro
CIA agents employees of Tor Inc, for that many years, I imagine he'd
"fucking had enough". Perhaps few men could stand as long as he did in
his situation... most are armchair anarchists, armchair Mannings,
armchair Assanges, waving our arms at "What a fucking bad job they're
doing, I could do it SO much better".

No, only the most successful ones.
Probably not a death sentence (although I think that's what they want
for Assange), more likely nothing, unless he becomes successful at
actually changing some part of the empire, then he'd become a rapist
with public "witnesses" telling their story.
Evidently Sweden's upper eschelongs/ oligarchs are held by North America
regime 'by the balls' - look at the public statements since the
"events", the statements of the two lasses who were supposedly raped by
The message is more important to the empire than the punishment - Julian
is holed up until at least 2020 from what we can tell, Manning doing
life in prison, Snowden exiled for god knows how long and because he cut
a deal with the devil (the Guardian) rather than go through Jake
Applebaum to Assange and wikileaks, his exile seems to be for little to
nothing in the way of actual facts.
   Snowden: have you learnt your lesson on this? Or are you compromised
   and therefore unable to admit you made a huge mistake on this one?
   Or are those who helped you flee North America wanting to save their
   asses, given their choice to help you as far as they considered that
   they could get away with helping you (given your personal choices)
   and so this is why your "leaks" are all filtered through the Western
   MSM and basically the facts themselves/ anything of real substance is
   now buried for decades?
   Snowden, do you deny there is a major problem in the particular
   process you chose/ choices you made, in this regard?

itself so blatantly, so cold heartedly.
It makes for a heavy heart, great sadness, disillusionment, infuriation,
exasperation and great anger towards the Empire, the North American
Regime of Chaos.

those pathways which may be most effective, either as individual action,
or most effective in inspiring other individuals to join us in a pathway

Pretty sure not, although they have been the conduit for mountains of
weapons from Libya and Ukraine into Syria - and Ukraine had a lot of

But I think any nukes got handled shortly after the collapse of USSR -
one of the rare examples of co-operation between North America and
Russia, to handle the ex-soviet nuclear arsenal. Thankfully.
And besides, the rat line from Libya and Ukraine has been run by the

In other words, the bill doesn't automatically affect the status quo of

you are Facebook or Google (though the "going to jail" bit, if it were
possible, would be a good outcome for Facebook for example ... alas, I

The jury's out, but the jury is always out - who knows what the future
will bring, who know's what "evidence of wrongdoing" or for that matter
what further "evidence of right doing" will be presented in respect of
Applebaum in the future.
I watched those talks by Applebaum that grarpamp posted, and I have a
new appreciation for who Applebaum is, at least a small view of part of
his life journey. And frankly, I like what I see. Combining this with
the way he was thrown under the bus by the rest of the Tor Inc (some now
ex) employees, paints a compelling picture for me that Applebaum was a
hard pill for the rest of Tor Inc to swallow - and I mean that in a
"very good for the rest of us" way.
The balance in my high mount everest opinion, from what little I've read
and seen so far, shows Applebaum in a light which is a very good light.
A man of empathy, a man who's not had an easy personal journey in life,
a man who made some tough and adventurous decisions in ways which I (for
what little it's worth) personally approve of.
Thank you Jacob Applebaum.

The US government drones people to death, every day, all around the
world, based on meta data that it collects globally to the greatest
extent possible.

Ramstein Air Base in Germany, established by the "IP"ers "technology"
and "security" "professionals" of America, these killings are all
extra-judicial, outside any court case, outside anything resembling
democracy or the rule of law!
HOW CAN WE TRUST YOU?
WHY SHOULD WE CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR STUDY?
You want feedback and assistance, but rather than any of:
 - principles
 - foundations
 - truth
 - true democracy
 - absolute sovereignty of the people,
you merely provide a list of conflicting "considerations" and "possible
intentions", which cannot possibly be resolved in your foundation terms.
The US North American regime has year after year, since World War 2,
deceived the people, bombed other people, unilaterally acted in war, and
generally been highly despotic in its actions.
How can this possibly be brought to a stop?

How will the results of your study help to stop the daily extra-judicial
killing by the US government by drone, all around the world?

North America has sold and bombed away every shred of honor, decency and

killing people in other sovereign nations.
The US government does not respect the rule of law.
The US government is not a democracy.
There are SO many problems with the US government, that any attempt to

That is, we the people, who contribute to your study, will end up, like
every other instance in the past, "screwed over".
So, again, why should we help you?
Western governments appear entirely lacking self awareness when it comes
to what they do (which is a lot of evil actions amongst other things),
how they are perceived by people who directly suffer the consequences of
the "government" not upholding and protecting the absolute human rights
of the people in its own country let alone other countries, as well as
in the eyes of those who witness such injustices.
If some country started conducting extra-judicial drone killings of US
citizens on US soil, do you think there might be an uproar?
You ("government") want to "balance" "competing" interests (so you
imply, you don't even be explicit about this) such as those of the
people (security, privacy and anonymity of communication for example -
we can only hope, you give no promise, no undertaking, we are to trust
you absolutely); and those "interests" of the government, which "should"
be aligned with the people, but never seem to be!
I.e. the interests of the government and military industrial banking
complex (monitoring the people to the greatest extent possible, to aid
those with power and money - i.e. subversion of the "democratic"
"government" to the selfish, greedy and despotic intentions of the few
with great money and great power).
Are you able to affect any real change?
Is there any hope that your study will actually help shift the "balance"
away from those with power, to the people of the world?
It is unlikely you can contribute to true democracy by helping to
dismantle this despotic global surveillance infrastucture that the US
government and its organs has put in place and uses to unilaterally kill
people daily (CIA: "we kill people based on meta data"), but anything
else you do will of course further these despotic intentions and methods
of globabl surveillance and despotic actions of killing people daily
without any trial, without any conviction, without any testing of
evidence and without any jury of ones peers, and therefore you will be
personally contributing to this evil that the world suffers at the hands
of the US government today.
And tomorrow.
And every day after that.
More and more humans being killed.
Herb/ Joy, can you help to stop this?
This global illegal communications intercepting and meta data and actual
data collecting infrastructure, is used on a daily basis to drone kill
people all over the world, outside of any judicial process, outside of
any "democratic" consent of 'the people' other than implied tacit
consent by apathy and momentum (which of course has no hope of competing
with the active monetary and power motivations of the military
industrial banking complex).
Can you help to stop these daily illegal killings?
"Democratic governments" consider themselves sovereign, and with
ultimate authority, and ultimate power.
The supreme authority of the people, both collectively as well as
individually, must be acknowledged, publicly, by any government to
consider itself legitimate, and for that government to be seen as
legitimate by educated humans.
All 'significant' decisions (say anything costing more than $1000, like
unilaterally dropping a drone bomb on a human in a foreign sovereign
country) must be put to the people to decide on, for any "democracy" to
actually be a democracy. Otherwise it is a fascist state, and not a
democracy, and is killing people illegally.
In other countries.
Many humans are schooled, but sadly, not educated.
It is very hard to build when you are facilitating the daily killing of
people around the world, outside the rule of law, outside democracy,
outside sanity.
Extra-judicial killing destroys trust, destroys democracy, and destroys
a nation. North America will ultimately suffer the fallout of its
despotic daily illegal killings.
Like killing people daily, completely illegally. That will certainly
destroy trust.
No individual can trust North America.
Even presidential aeroplanes (the highest of "diplomatic immunity" if
such a thing even existed or was respected by USA) is violated by the
North American government - witness the grounding of the Ecuadorian
president's plane in America's desperation to try to catch Snowden.
No nation can trust the North American/ USA government.
Are you truly surprised?
Are you surprised that there is an enormous gap of trust?
Are you suggesting that gap is not deserved?
Are you mistakenly believing that the U.S. government is good and
Perhaps their conscience is getting to them, with all the killings
happening by their infrastructure, on a daily basis, by the US military?
Killing takes a toll on conscionable humans.
It is not helpful to the US government.
But this rift is VERY helpful to we the people. We are suffering the
despotic actions of the US government.

maintain distrust of the US government, or for some of us, we will be
killed as a result of our righteous actions!
If we let down our guard, we will be imprisoned for many years simply
for exercising our right of freedom of speech!
HOW DARE you suggest that our distrust is not helpful to our side.
And who's SIDE are you on?!!!!
When the government is at war with people/ on the other side, of its own
people, and you work for the government, are you on the right side or
the wrong side?
Shouldn't you be trying to cause others "in government" to treat the
people as not "on the other side"?
How can you, the government, speak to us like this?
- destroy all meta data collected
- dismantle the global monitoring infrastructure
- rapproach with Russia (the US MIC needs an enemy to maintain
  justification for its funding)
- dismantle Ramstein Air Base
- respect China
- respect sovereignty of nations
- obtain permission from sovereign democratically elected governments
  before going to war or assisting in any way a civil war within a
  country
- respect international law
- respect the rule of law
- stop collecting meta data
- stop killing people daily, illegally
- stop overthrowing sovereign nations
- stop frauding your own elections
Stop killing people illegally.
Using the IT community created infrastructure, to illegally kill people
every day, every week, every month, every year, year after year.
Can this be stopped?
Stop killing people illegally, every day, in sovereign countries all
around the world.
Promise to the world, publicly, repeatedly, to never kill people
illegally again.
Promise to the world, publicly, to stop sending weapons to anyone.
Promise to the world to start obeying the rule of law, international
law, and the UN Security Council.
Stick to these promises.

You flatter me too much; I give thanks for my existence - these bodies
and this world are just amazing.
And I ask my fellow humans for patience, tolerance and forgiveness for
my many failings.  I am certainly glad when able to share a moment of
clarity, and grateful to those who clearly point out any failings as I
present such... it's a long journey being human, and we share this

of the humble!
Here we go round the mulberry bush, the muleberyy bush, da mulled bree

And the winner is - no one! This is sad. The bill is sad. Your

OK, I'll help out here - read this paragraph just above again, then
without blinking (I'm serious now) read the following paragraph three
I'm getting lazy, so I'm going to trust you to point out to us, in
simple terms, your own contradiction, e.g. how a commieputer program
running on my phone, and talking to Juan or Applebaum's phone which is
likewise running the same program, how this program for example could be
considered to be encompassed by "any service", with me, running that
program as the "relevant operator" of my telemaphone, which service so
operated consists of provision (to me the operator, likewise to Juan or
Appelbaum at the other end as mentioned) of "access to" or at the very
least "facilitates for making use of" a certain "telecommuniscations
system" provided by my ISP/Telco (and likewise by/for Juan or Applebaum
at the other end as previously mentions), and further which program
manages the latency of, facilitates the creation of the connection, and
optionally stores for the operator the data thereby transmitted, or that
may be transmitted next time I operate this sytsem, my means -of- the
Again, I'll leave it to you to point out such an example for the benefit
of our loyal, deserving and patronising readers.
(I'll assume those particular forms of encryption are those particular
forms of encryption not covered by the Act of course, since as you so
magnanimously pointed out, the Act does not ban any end to end
Ahh ok, so so long as I am not added to her unilaterally designated and
completely hidden (for national security purposes of course) "no fly"
list, whoops sorry, I mean "may not end to end encrypt" list, i.e. as
long as I am not designated as a terrorist, whoops sorry again, I mean
"relevant operator",
which I am not entitled to know about,
and for which, if I were so designated, either individually or as a
class, say "those humans who have subscribed to cypherpunks list, made a
phone call to Iraq or Syria, made any donation to Greenpeace (those
bloody terrorists), or used the Tor Browser Bundle, attended a Communist
Party event, participated in an Occupy protest, or have any family
member who protested against Vietnam war, Falklands war, Afganistan war,
the cold war or any other way,
then I should be ok to keep using end to end encryption?
Which for example if I am running Linphone in a VM on CyanogenMod on my
mobile handset, I could never be "considered to be providing or
operating or managing and potentially providing access to" any
"telecommunications service" to myself, with or without "conference
room" audio facility to connect a few Libyans in a conference call, or
Can you see the picture?
As long as ALL of the above conditions are met, and ALL of the
conditions we have not yet thought of are met, by me, then I should be
A-OK, she'll be right mate, just end to end encrypt right on brother...
Woah! Awesome. Thanks Peter for your legal interpretation of that Act
and its exemption for PGP!
Come on guys, now swap out libtorcrypt.so and plug in libgpgcrypt.so
instead - Peter tells us that'll be A-OK and we'll all get a free ticket
for facilitating our end to end voice, text, chat and video calls to any
and all, right around the world!
Jump on the Free Train - We live in a dee-mock-crass see?
Sing it brother, we are SAVED! Sing it from the hill tops!
Phew! Pete, brother, you really had me going there for a while I really
thought we were all fucked..
Ahh ok, so as long as Juan or Applebaum don't run their phone directory
and voice service daemon on their mobile handset, in the geographic
territory called UK, only THEN are we all ok.
Shit, I dunno WHAT to believe. Peter, you make it so confusing?
Because they could never be classified by her as relevant operators -
only terrorist would ever be so classified.
   Ladies, and, Gentlemen!
   We have conclusion!
Wellllll ... Peter ... you certainly cleared all that up. The bill only
applies to relevant operators, which could never be Facebook or Google,
probably could never be end user operators, unless possibly their bodies
are physically located in the UK, but it's likely the new Act would
apply to terrorist, but we're not sure, we do no it will likely harm
Facebook and Google, but it doesn't apply to them because no court would
ever uphold that they are relevant operators.
Peter, we mere humans are eternally grateful. Please, do come again...

You sir, receive the award from The Ministry of Truth!
In all seriousness, you need to read, re-read, and read again, that
which you write.
I will assume for now that you are well intentioned, but take notice, as
the old saying goes "the road to hell is paved with good intentions".
Please, if you want to contribute to comprehending this new UK act, you
will need to slow it waaay down, because you are writing conclusions,
assumptions, with minimal quotes from the act, and making assertions
based on these foundation things, and these foundation things are
contradictory, and your conclusions are contradictory.
Perhaps it's the British way, or perhaps the intention behind the
passing of this Act is so nefarious, that the only way they could pass
it was to be as obtuse, opaque and contradictory as it is, so that,
ultimately, they (the parliament and those behind it - "the Lords
spiritual and the Lods temporal") can wreak their mischief on the
'unsuspecting' people.
Peter, if your intention be genuinely "pro" the people and "pro" human
rights or at least "pro" understanding/comprehending, my assessment is
that so far, you are diving into the trap this Act sets and intends for
you - i.e. that you be "unsuspecting" of evil intentions behind it,
trusting in the government, trusting in those who drafted it, trusting
in your "Lords temporal" -
I urge you to be not so trusting, and you may find it easier to home in
on the keys, finding that clarity which is implied in your attempt to
bring to others the meaning, intentions and consequences of this Act of
the UK parliament.
Colloquially (again) - FFS WAKE UP!

When we see someone that we want to say "come in spinner" to, our first
duty is to assume good intention.
When we don't see what is horrific, that which is an abomination to
human, an abomination to righteousness, and we see someone justifying
it, qualifying it, basically being "apologetic" for it, it is too easy
to see mal intent.
However, the road to hell has a lot of paving. It is by the hand of our
fellow humans that the many and varied well paved roads to hell, are so
well paved!
This affects us all!
The snow jobs that are presented, the blindness, can be interpreted in
different ways.
Everyone has the opportunity, should they carpe diem, to wear a
different hat when that hat is presented.
To myself folks have kindly (usually) said "Hey Zenaan, that's pretty
harsh" and "hey Zenaan, you're jumping to conclusions" and "oi Zenaan,
you're raking someone over the coals, and they don't deserve it" and
"Zenaan, you are emotionally vehement about this pet theory of yours, do
you truly have any facts behind it", and far too many times folks have
been right, and on those times I am able to wear another hat, to see my
own blindness, I am very grateful (at least, sometimes, after licking my
perceived wounds for a few days or weeks).
What causes our blindness?
- a desire to believe in our government/ system
- attachment to our own beliefs/ world views
- a belief in my/ my tribe's (my nation's) superiority
- a "hippy" or fatalistic belief that "it all works out eventually,
  everyone's just doing their best, so it's all ok"
But it's not all ok.
There is much that is so very, very wrong. So wrong and so bad, it is
evil in action. Unethical beyond belief.
North America's incarceration rate of predominantly black people, mostly
for purported "crimes" that harm no one, not a single person (e.g.
smoking a bit of weed, selling a bit of weed, not paying a parking fine
and being caught a few times with a "disqualified driver license" as a
result, and doing 18 months jail the second and third times this then
happens again).
Men and women lose their jobs as a result of such evil.
Single separated parents are unable to travel to see their children
(withe the other parent) as a result of such evil.
Families are broken up as a result of such evil (the bloke loses his
license, cannot lawfully drive to work, loses his job, loses his sense
of dignity, family breaks up.)
We humans collectively via our tacit consent of our "democratic"
governments, bring hell down on our neighbours, or on "other people in
other suburbs who -must- be somewhat bad or they would not be in jail".
We are so desperate to find "the evil out there" that a mere allegation
of rape or pedophilia causes us to jump on a public lynch train.
We are so bound in our "lives" that we vote over and over again for the
mainstream political parties who are compromised in all ways and who
continue the endless litany of murder by empire, day in, day out.
We humans are fundamentally shameful, unable to break the chains of our
schooling and programming, deceiving ourselves that the words used in an
Act mean something other than what they say, hoping beyond fact, hoping
beyond all evidence that our "government" is there to do (at least
some) good.
Violation of human rights, when instituted in statute, demonstrates an
evil, on the record of the governments own Act.
Here in Australia, us Aussies say about our GST tax "oh well, the
government needs money to run, oh well, it's worse in other countries,
oh well, the money is used for schools and hospitals" and yet the act
says "The commissioner of taxation may deem an event that did not happen
as having happened, and an event that did happen as having not happened,
or may deem that an event that happened, actually happened at a time
other than when it actually happened".
And the people pay.
The people consent.
Yet more so, the people become apologists, trying to defend the
indefensible "someone has to pay for the roads, that why we have road
tolls" or "PGP gets an exemption" or "people die in cars, that's we have
to have RFID sat tracking state issued driver licenses".
We, humans, defend the indefensible. Scraping the barrell for some
sanity where there is none. Assuming good intention in words which
demonstrate evil intention, demonstrate the intention to remove human
rights, intention to grant to the executive (government "officials") the
power to demonically deem black to be white, truth to be falsity,
falsity to be truth, and anyone they don't like to be a terrorist.
When you accept the indefensible, even tacitly by doing no action in
opposition, you contribute a little bit to that evil.
When you try to defend the indefensible, it is a bit worse, because you
lead others astray - the busy, the tired, those who might trust you
without reading in depth, those who are unable to read, those who are
naturally influenced by the "charisma" of someone speaking publicly.
Better to say nothing, than to lead others astray.  I am so very
grateful when others have pointed out my bullshit - it's a small mercy,
and much better than my bullshit prevailing.
To those who care, let's lift our game!
We can do better.
To those who intentionally perpertrate deception, confusion, lies and
evil, may the warriors of sanity tear your evil words to shreds!

It's a question for introspection, not so much a question for answer. I
saw a rather muddled and contradictory interpretation of a recent UK
"anti end to end encryption Act", and the question is, what questions
can we ask ourselves, or suggest to one another, to help each other
"wake up"?
The rest is just noise sorry - I'll try to be clearer next time.
Oh absolutely not - true drivel!
You must only believe my ANTI-commie propaganda! That other stuff I spew
out is highly suspect at the best of times...
Ummm... I'm not American, so I'll leave it to someone who has
experienced whatever this CNN thing is that you speak of...
but good luck anyway, if you're seeking believable propaganda, I know
this bloke who speaks rather highly of something also known as direct
democracy - I think it was called anarchism or something. He's pretty
brash, and you might find yourself wanting to kill file him here and
there, but his propaganda is top notch, that's for sure!!! Definitely
believable, and I reckon it's worth believing too...
... can't remember his name just yet ... it'll come to me though, and
when I do, I'll be sure to pass it on. Well worth the bother I say...

Very unlikely I am not blind to many things.
Tis a sad state of affairs which I sincerely wish to improve on.
What I -do- say is that USA is a global bullying hegemon, and highly
despotic in its actions, and absolutely must be stopped if at all
possible (preferably peacefully, but if that does not happen, it is
possible we will be unfortunate to experience some form of war -
international (very unfortunately if so) or perhaps a domestic civil war
- but really, when that US dollar dissolves, which can't be far off
looking at debt interest payments vs GDP/tax collection, perhaps America
will just stop being aggressive to the world, and finally start to focus
on fixing their own problems internally - we can only hope).
And as to Russia - especially in the light of Saddam and Qaddafi's
results of trying to shift the petro dollar system (acting in their
respective national interests, and thereby weakening USA's ability to
bully the world), ought we be grateful that Russia is still standing,
and moreso leading the charge of a different world (multi polar) system?
Would China have spearheaded BRICS? Never!
Would Brazil or any of the South American countries have had the ability
to do it?
South Africa? Anyone else?
No country was able to stand for an alternative system (alternative to
hegemonic North America), without Russia - does this not seem
Is any system which says "no" to unilateral bullying and unilateral debt
and inflation exportation (of USA, to the rest of the world, via their
petro dollar) a "good" thing for the rest of us?
It seems so to me...
(PS And so it seems to me we should be -very- grateful to Putin - Russia
would have fallen without someone of his standing - but I think it takes
a -lot- of reading to determine this (his actual words, both Russian AND
Western propaganda, as well as the on lookers from Pepe Escobar, to
Saker, to Germany's points of view to plenty more - without a great deal
of deep diving, it is almost impossible to escape the Western MSM
narrative; just my high opinion of course).)
(PPS Step 1: save the Russian nation, done; Step 2, handle USA, this is
in progress and will be for a while yet, unfortunately; Step 3, when the
day comes that USA is handled, then there might be space in peoples'
consciousness to once again consider experimenting with utopian
communities, enclaves and possibly mini Rojava-sized nations; in the
meantime, how can we stop USA acting so vilely, so despotically, day in
and day out?
Is this not the only question of significance to the world today?

Find your own center!
Do you have a conscience (serious question)?
If so, what is it that --your-- conscience says is right, and says is
Feel free to ask me what I believe, or think you "should" believe, or
what can we do, or whatever, but ultimately the only thing that matters
in this world is your own inner authority - what YOU choose to do and
effect into this world as best you can!
You can answer that question here, or hold it as a precious candle of
righteousness inside yourself - that is always up to you - but choose
wisely, foster that which is good and righteous inside yourself, do what
you can to strengthen that part of yourself that is good for the world!
Seriously, we (and I include myself here) in "the West" are truly
schooled in various things which mostly disempower us and cause us to be
really fucked up in a few fundamentals. Here are just two of them:
1) We humans seek external authority.
grarpamp, what I believe or say ultimately shouldn't matter --to the
things that are important to you personally--.
In school from a terribly young age we "yes sir" and "no sir" and accept
our punishment of detention when we rebel against the insanity, inanity
and motivation-destroying environment that is "school" - 45 minutes and
BANG there goes the fire bell! OFF to another class for you NO MATTER
how engrossed you are in the current subject - even if you FINALLY
managed to clear you mind just a little, start reading or start
actually contemplating or juggling a thought or two but NO! PACK YOUR
GEAR SON AND GET TO THE NEXT CLASS, you gotta change topic NOW!!
And you obey.
Because you have no option. Your parents sent you there. Everyone else
obeys. We are schooled to obey.
Except some drop out and or fail to learn even to read and write.
But we learn that we must obey EXTERNAL authority!
The school bell. The teacher. The parents. The police officer.
The government. The think tank.
So, grarpamp, do NOT project your authority onto me!
Seriously STOP!
For this world to have ANY hope of getting better, you must live your
own authority.
Of course this means you first find your authority, within yourself.
All I can do is ask a question or two, post a hopefully provocative
anti-pro-commie link to kick your brain, all Juan can do is try to point
out a possible attachment you have to your government or a particular
implied or explicit belief you seem to have and ask you (rhetorically)
"grarpamp, do you really want to keep holding that belief?"
Sometimes perhaps we should be asked by a Juan or a John "can you see
what I see about what you say?"
There is no perfect question! It is our own, individual job to wake up -
we must do our part if we are to have any -hope- of waking up or at
least seeing something we did not see before!
You see, when you get caught up in "oh that's just propaganda" or "Juan
you offended me I'm kill filing you", you are a sheep, lost in
personality, lost in self pity, some sense of hurt or shame or pride or
some other bullshit. Piss it off!
Same goes for me - I've been caught up too many times in what I
perceived as personal attacks on me SO many times its bloody
embarrassing in hindsight. And next. I've witnessed my aggression
towards others when I felt I was "unfairly" treated, jibed, dismissed or
attacked - one or two incidents of this (my reactive aggressive towards
another individual) have brought upon myself many years of personal
heart pain. Life's a bitch - or rather, I've been a bitch, and I just
hope people forgive me here and there, and that I catch myself more as I
go forward, before I blurt out some hurtful or bullying statement.
Memories can tear us apart, so I try to transform them into positive
action arising from my conscience. Might not be much... but I try...
Embrace the clarity that Juan thinks he brings for me (mostly) it looks
like clarity - if you can't see it, and are blinded by some bullshit
sense of personal injury, Fuck that off bro!  The pity pot ain't useful for fixing this world!
Seriously, who gives a rat's arse what Juan or I or anyone think about
you? But truly, if you read between the lines, it looks to me like Juan
really cares about you. Few go to such lengths as he does to say "dude,
do you hear yourself!"
Sure, you don't have to agree with him (or me, or anyone), you might
think he's wrong, hell he might be wrong! Who cares? STOP TAKING IT
PERSONALLY! We don't have time for that!
"What is it I might not be seeing?"
Most everyone round these parts (besides the CIA and USA apologists) is
actually wanting and hoping that we might glean some new nugget to help
us and others help this world, to help stop the evil that USA gov is
Others use the list to dump their brain, to try to get clarity through
feedback, to try to uncover some evil or potential problem presenting
itself some place on the glove. Many just look and listen.
It is heartbreaking to witness what's happening in the world, but we
cannot look away, we must continue ...
2) We humans project our own nature onto others.
Example: if we are 'lustful yet guilty feeling', we (humans) tend to
assume most/ all others are lustful and guilty feeling - classic problem
in relationships where partner A has an awesome partner B; partner B is
vivacious, socially and sexually confident and matching the natural
desires and appetite of partner A, and is naturally charismatic, so when
in public, partner B is happy to flirt and "be cheeky" whilst knowing at
all times they are faithful to their partner A since they are
trustworthy and therefore trust themselves as well as their partner A;
yet despite such an awesome partner B, partner A cannot cope because
they themselves are insecure and sexually guilt-laden due to their
"Church umbrella" upbringing, so they distrust partner B, they PROJECT
onto partner B, the insecurities and lack of strength that they feel
themselves, and far too often, for such reasons, partner A breaks off
the relationship!
So (Peter I'm looking at you on this one :) stop projecting on your
"leaders" in your "democratic UK government" that just because they
"debate" a new Act, don't assume it is an Act which has good intention
behind it, don't assume that the words that can be taken to have
meanings that clearly actively against our interests, "might not really
be against us, or here's hoping" - that way lies madness and the well
paved roads to hell!
Just because -you- have good intentions, don't assume others do. Of
course, assume good faith, but --vigorously-- test their bullshit
(including mine of course!) in case they have bad intention.  If they
truly have good intention, they will thank you and fix up their
bullshit, if they don't, they are either terminally schooled, or active
against our interests.
Good luck,

Oh it is too easy to be harsh. I have been harsh much too much in the
past (not so distant past too I might add - apologies again).
To get to clarity inside ourselves is a long journey. I am hearing
George's heart here - perhaps just a bit lost in his head, that is all.
I get very lost in mine, far too often :/
Better perhaps to cut each other a little more slack - that's what I
want for myself anyway.
Passion is good, defence of good intentioned people who are being
attacked is also good.
I ask myself: how can we accomplish these goals, and make sure we help
build up people who are wanting to be "good" by grokking their own
conscience, finding their own center, and hopefully eventually acting in
the world without just paving another road to hell.
May be not easy, but all we have is each other. Need to expand the field
of those who might act to help the world, as much as possible.
Well, it is a genuine viewpoint, and I have not exactly posted much
"negative" stuff about Russia. I see and agree that there is some
negative stuff about Russia (some of the corrupt regional governors are
finally getting a few lessons, but I assume there are quite a few more
out there - hopefully they get the message and live a higher game going
forward - we can only hope; also the backdoor for all encryption and
ISPs must store all data for X period of time - it's pretty bad stuff,
I said it before, but: on a whole-world scale, I think the world
desperately needs a counter-force to USA.
It is my firm opinion, in the face of the attempts by Saddam and Qaddafi
(Qaddafi was deceived big time after his help to USA after 9/11, another
despotic USA double cross and back stabbing - absolutely despicable!) to
sell their oil in Euros (not Dinars, Euros mind you!) and the
consequences thereafter, that Russia is the only man standing between
USA hegemony, and a slightly software multi polar world.
SO, strategically, we ABSOLUTELY NEED Russia.
Who else can stop the hegemon? Even Russia cannot stop the hegemon by
herself, but China, Brazil, and other countries were willing to take a
stand behind Russia. How can we not be grateful for this? Brazil and
other countries have since taken a beating, China keeps getting
threatened, Russia is under eternal sanctions and her allies and buffer
zones are being attacked and undermined, but together these nations are
standing against the bully, the United States of America. Together they
are still standing, despite the multitudinous attacks on the global
I really, really hope that this stand against the global bully that is
the USA, continues, and prevails.
I hope that the USA hegemony falls - no matter the cost to North America
or her allies, since the devastating cost that the USA is wreaking upon
the world is unforgivable!
The USA's actions over the last endless years, continuing today, day in
and day out, is unforgivable!
The hegemon must be brought down.
(Sorry for being so wordy!)
(PS Alex, thank you for your heart and your passion - what I thought was
obvious, and is obvious to you, was evidently not so obvious.)

Peter, I think you need to read up on what is a "backdoor", what is
"encryption" and how they relate to each other, and therefore how your
persistent statement that the Act "doesn't ban encryption" is either a
folly to say on your part (I'm only just still assuming) or an
intentional furfy (hard for me to believe anyone knowledgeable would try
that on this list, since everyone on this list (I assume) has no trouble
identifying the folly in your many conflicting statements.
Have you done any computer programming?
If not, that would be a really good thing for you to do - there are some
very nice languages and programming environments (IDEs, REPL shells etc)
compared to what we had in our day, so it should be an enjoyable, and
hopefully enlightening experience for you.
There's no point repeating the mulberry bush roundabout, since it's
about to get frustrating for me (and probably already has for most of
the kind and patient folks on this cp list whom are probably quite a
bit cleverer than you or I).
Chalk this one up to a learning experience Peter and let it go for now -
your enthusiasm is a good thing, but when it comes to communications
security, your lack of understanding is very, very dangerous to those
need actual security and who mistake your authoritative words for actual
authority and actual understanding on your part - that's a dangerous
thing for those who need communications security, you would be in some
cases putting actual lives at risk. Stop that.
Learning is fun - enjoy the ride.

Peter, there is absofuckinglutely NO way I will EVER accept your desire
for me to cow before your authority of interpretation of this despotic
UK bill/Act!!!
You seriously lack self awareness of how I hear the words that you keep
writing, in particular the words in your email below.
You may live in the UK in a circle of folks who accept your authority.
I am not one of them.
Your attempt to impose your authority will succeed with many of the
people, most of the time, because most Western humans are extremely
schooled, and almost exclusively externalise their authority! This is a
fucking shame!!!
And even the folks on THIS list struggle with the conversation!!!! We
are the fringe so-called "anarchists" who bash all governments at every
opportunity, crave a world where individual authority ("sovereignty") is
respected above most other things!
And here you come, to a crypto, anarchist, email mailing list, and say
the things you say below, and the things you say in your other emails.
 You, Peter Fairbrother, are either seriously messed up and intensely
 lacking in self awareness, bombastic in your expectation that others
 submit to/ accept your authority by fiat of your own words (so who the
 fuck are you?!??),
 or you are intentionally trolling us!
Either take a deep breath and go learn to code and read a pschology
primer, or if you can't take the hint, leave this list. Leave us the
hell alone since your words are very dangerous to onlookers such as a
potential future whistleblower who actually needs to come to grips with
the UK jurisdiction and how to cope inside the physical boundaries of
that jurisdiction.
The useful part of the discussion is you quote which apparently (I hope
you are accurate) assembles the relevant bits from the act, which we and
other security minded folks DO need to know about. That's useful and
thanks. Other than that, you don't know what you're talking about.
So take your presumption of authority, and try to put that to a
constructive use. You are presently a fair way away from being
constructive in this conversation.

You may be right. I do not know him, nor what is in his mind/ his true
intention. Perhaps he really intends to troll me. It is possible I could
deserve that - I'm just a human, all humans are fallible.
Perhaps I used less than the best words and should say "I am hoping to
hear his heart" - perhaps that is clearer, perhaps not. Perhaps I am
naieve and gullible, I don't know for sure.
Perhaps we can agree on the following:
1. I have posted a lot of pro-Russia articles. 2. Before today I had not clarified in simple terms my belief that
Russia is the only reason BRICS could be created, and the only reason
other nations have the guts to stand together against the attacks from
the USA.
You see when I read George's words I read what I considered to be a
"genuine bafflement" - as in, he was sort of asking me "dude, are just
trolling us or what?" - that's certainly been suggested before.
So since this "are you trolling?" keeps coming at me, then my next
thought was "to me it seems obvious I'm not - I am trying to present
relevant facts" - but relevant to what? Why is it that I say that Putin
rescuing Russia from destruction as a nation, is a good thing?
And then I had the "ahah!" moment and thought: I guess I haven't clearly
stated my thesis of "a) USA vs the world, and b) Russia gives balls to
the other countries" thesis.
I hope it was useful for someone ... George perhaps.
PS It's not fair for me to hide my thesis, to just assume everyone
thinks the way I do, and from this point of view, it was a fair call (in
my mind) for George to call me on it - perhaps there are other things I
take for granted that make me look like a nut job, perhaps there always
will be. I don't get much feedback see, so without George challenging
me, I would not have been pushed to consider that may be I was
withholding my viewpoint.

Making a mistake of which name it was supposed to be at that particular

willingness to fix the mistake and move on.
We have bigger problems to worry about, like many daily extra-judicial
killings all around the world but the USA government which pretends it

And I'd agree with you.
Putin sure wanted and tried hard over many years to create an alliance
with the west, and genuine state-level economically mutually beneficial
"partnership", with perks of "fighting the same 'bad' guys together".
Over and over he kept/ keeps getting snubbed - so yes, the lack of any
rapproachment between Russia and USA is certainly not for want of Russia
Perhaps this failure of USA to get in bed with Russia is a better long
term outcome; I suspect so.

Because Syria is Russias very long term national partner, and Turkey is
also making up with Russia. ISTM that Turkey will back off completely
now and stop sending the jihadis to Syria.
Could be wrong of course, but I don't think Russia would accept
rapproachment if Turkey keeps fighting Syria. I.e., Erdogan will have
his hand in the Russian Turk Stream money pot, and will give up Syrian
ISIS oil smuggling trade in return - he will make MUCH more money
shipping Russian gas, then laundering ISIS oil. Just pragmatism.

  Rayzer, seriously, are you serious?
Which North Atlantic + European military bloc rhyming with poTATO
is Turkey+Erdogan a member of again? (Hint: NATO.)
And which country is Syria's primary military partner and long term
ally again? (Hint: Russia.)
And who was it that intended to overthrow Syria again? (Hint: USA.)
And who was it that established ISIS, trained, funded and provided
weapons to ISIS collaborators, provided military and logistical support
to invade Syria and was loudly proclaiming for 4 years that "Assad must
go"?  (Hint: USA.)
Did you not watch that interview/ talk by USA General Wesley Clark?
Here it is again:
(article links to the full Wesley Clark interview - recommended (I'd
only seen the short most significant part before)
Rayzer, you are parroting the establishment/ MSM position, is that
position truthful? (Hint: it is a lie.)
To remind ourselves of a few further facts:
- The first refugee waves into Europe came from Afganistan and then
  Iraq.
- The second refugee wave into Europe came from Libya. Until Qaddafi's
  murder at the hands of Hillary "We came, we saw, he died" Clinton,
  Libya essentially "captured" a lot of African refugees (look how many
  CIA ops and USA MIC wars are going on in Africa), and Libya provided a
  lot of employment, hope, accomodation and, relatively speaking,
  stability.  Look at the immigration of actual refugees into Europe
  since Libya was "democratically liberated" by the West (USA, France,
  Germany, UK).
- Only the third wave comes from Syria, and this wave of refugees into
  Europe from Syria began --way-- before Russia went into Syria to
  rescue her ally, only in November/December last year (Hint: 2015)!
  And this third wave has predominantly been from Turkey, not Syria -
  and Erdogan used it as blackmail for a few billion $Euro from Germany
  - many times Erdogan was blackmailing in fact. Turkey to Lesbos (Greek
  island) has been a main conduit for Syrian, Iraqi and Afghani
  refugees, for one example.
If you look at the media though, you see a different story (the lie that
is), you see all this "ooh, so much Muslim refugees into Europe, since
BAD RUSSIA went to defend Syria!"
Since you seem to know details about Erdogan's deals with Russia,
perhaps you care to share them with the rest of us?

Great question Georgi.
I2P has been touted, but despite a stated intention, it still lacks the
most relevant fundamental enhancement over tor:
- chaff traffic (i.e. maintain e.g. a 15kibps connection to each of my
  direct peers, throtting and chaff-filling as needed to achieve that)
Fundamentals of any stack for any system are:
 - physical concept - N2N/ neighbour to neighbour vs software overlay
   on existing ISP based centralised "Internet" as people know it today
 - hardware
   - open cores are available
   - but audit trails and distribution networks and more still need to
     be solved conceptually, before any sort of kickstarter/ community
     group funding
 - ability/ tools/ software for small community groups to randomly audit
   a random chip, circuit board, ethernet jack, etc, to verify that it
   conforms to a FLOSS design
 - bios and firmware - EVERY piece of the stack MUST be FLOSS!
   - needs to be audited
 - drivers - more FLOSS required
   - need a minimal set, to go with chosen hardware
   - needs to be audited
 - network stack - floss of course
   - needs to be audited
Pick any level of the stack, have a think, and contribute.
My current pet thought lorenz well is the network stack - twould be good
to have an analysis of available stack, comparing them re various
attributes, including:
 - simplicity
 - dependencies - libraries, data structures
 - suitability to user space operation
 - what application-level APIs/ libraries would we want to target,
   e.g. just UDP (not TCP :), sockets, SCTP, ethernet, more?
 - "flexibility"
 - to what level is it field tested?
Sadly, there is much work to do before we can even begin to satisfy the
Juan's of the world :/

So you're American, and some rogue trainers, agency guys and atheletes
have been doping, like say your cyclists, sprinters and the odd swimmer.
Since this doping scandal is "systemic" in North Amerika, it is
evidently appropriate to ban all American's from participating at the
games, unless they can prove their innocence.
Oh, and just to teach a lesson, those atheletes that have never been
involved in doping, if and only if they can prove they never doped their
bodies, well they can participate in the upcoming Olympics, but they are
not allowed to represent North America, and if the get a gold medal, the
American national anthem will NOT be played - since Russia is hosting
the Olympics, the Russian national anthem will be played instead.

Further, direct from the Kremlin:
Statement in response to the report by the World Anti-Doping Agency
July 18, 2016
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Recent events and the tense
atmosphere that has formed around international sport and the Olympic
movement involuntarily recall the situation in the early 1980s. Back
then, many Western countries, citing the deployment of Soviet troops in
Afghanistan, boycotted the Moscow Olympics. Four years later, the Soviet
Union retaliated by boycotting the Los Angeles Olympics, using the
pretext of an allegedly insufficient level of security for the Soviet
team. The result was that many Soviet and American athletes and athletes
from other countries were caught up in this campaign of reciprocal
boycotts and lost the chance to add their names to world sporting
history. Their years of long and hard effort and training were in vain.
In short, people had their dreams broken and became hostages of
political confrontation. The Olympic movement found itself in a serious
crisis and faced divisions within. Later, some of the political figures
of that era on both sides admitted that this had been a mistake.
Today, we see a dangerous return to this policy of letting politics
interfere with sport. Yes, this intervention takes different forms
today, but the essence remains the same; to make sport an instrument for
geopolitical pressure and use it to form a negative image of countries
and peoples. The Olympic movement, which is a tremendous force for
uniting humanity, once again could find itself on the brink of division.
Today, so-called ‘doping scandals’ are the method used, attempts to
apply sanctions for detected cases of doping to all athletes, including
those who are ‘clean’, supposedly to protect their interests. But unlike
in the 1980s, athletes undergo very strict and comprehensive anti-doping
tests during competition and during the entire training process. Over
the last 6 months, all Russian athletes have undergone anti-doping tests
on WADA’s recommendations, with the tests overseen by the UK Anti-Doping
Agency and other anti-doping laboratories abroad.
The accusations against Russia’s athletes are based on information given
by one single person, an individual with a notorious reputation.
Criminal charges were opened against him in 2012 for violating
anti-doping laws, but there was not enough evidence against him at that
moment and the case was dropped. On June 17 this year, following his
allegations of involvement in using banned substances and information
from Russian athletes concerning extortion, a criminal case was reopened
against him in connection with the new circumstances that had come to
light. One of his close relatives, who used to work under his direction,
has already been convicted in Russia for illegal trade in anabolic
steroids. The question arises as to how much trust we can place in
arguments based solely on the allegations of people of this kind, and
how much weight can such allegations have.
The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and several anti-doping agencies in
other countries, without waiting for the official publication of the
World Anti-Doping Agency’s commission, have hastened to demand that the

What is behind this haste? Is it an attempt to create the needed media
atmosphere and apply pressure? We have the impression that the USADA
experts had access to what is an unpublished report at the very least,
and have set its tone and even its content themselves. If this is the

The officials named in the commission's report as directly involved will
be temporarily removed from their posts until a full investigation is

responsibility, we ask the WADA commission to provide fuller and more

Not to mention our Aussie post 9/11 gestapo legislation which has snuck
under the radar and never been repealed. Australia is now just awaiting
a modern Hitler to "put it to good use" - detention without lawyer
because "terrorist", no right to say you are detained, or why, to your
family, indefinite detainment, no right to trial by jury, no nothing. If
you're a terrst, you're gone! Pretty sure we have similarly bad comms

for censoship of any kind.
My thesis is that everything we do, everything we say, everything we
code, -is- politics to a greater degree. The geopolitical status today
is hectic, and possibly getting worse by the month. And so, we need to
focus on whatever we can possibly do to bring this beast called the USA
down to a soft landing for the rest of the world.
Whatever it takes, this is our primary goal.
After that, we can get back to our lives in general.

A whistleblower is someone who provides facts/ data such as emails,
letters, you know, the sort of stuff that Wikileaks would publish if it
were compelling and likely to be true or verifiable in some way.
There was in fact talk of the entire US cycling team being banned some
years back.
Anyway, even if the your government were shown to be encouraging their
athletes to use doping enhancement drugs, if you were personally not
using drugs, would you consider it due process of law that you were
blanket banned from participating in the Olympic games and, due to your
patriotism, representing your country?
I would stand for your right to participate and represent your country.
The alternative is guilt by association, penalty without trial and
conviction; this alternative would imply a political campaign of abuse
of fairness and due process and would personally stand vehemently
against that, no matter the country targetted, ON PRINCIPLE!
Seems to me there is this mindset in America that the law/ judicial
process/ democratic principles/ international law, all of these things
should be bypassed - there should be no checks and balances, merely the
say so of a disgruntled or paid-off "whistleblower" who only says "he
said she said", i.e. hear say only.
On principle this is the pathway to despotism. Allow such despotism
against your enemies and ultimately you allow despotism, in principle,
against yourself.
How we treat our purported "enemies" and "bad guys" when they are in a
position of weakness and we are holding the cards of power (/ political
correctness/ purported authority, etc) - THAT makes the mark of a nation
and a man!
America be a mighty bully at this point in history ... we must stand
against bullying, on all levels!

Justice: Which countries treat suspects as guilty until proven innocent?
It's bad everywhere, including here in Australia, from "crimes" where
there are no victims (as in most of "the west") to instutitionalization
of the principle of guilty until you prove your damn innocence.
Australia is a classic example of a messed up country - this stuff

Hazem El Masri case shows Australia has a problem with innocent until
proven guilty
The principle of treating someone as innocent until they are proven
guilty no longer exists.
George Williams March 15 2016
George Williams    'Trouble just happens to find you': Hazem El Masri opens up
   Australia has a problem with the presumption of innocence. It is
being displaced by a rush to judgment. The reasons for this are
understandable, but problematic. People want to believe that the
perpetrator of a violent act has been found and arrested. They
want to see someone punished for the crime.
      El Masri urges others to report violence
   Hazem El Masri has spoken to the press after charges against him were
   dropped. He encouraged those listening to report all instances of
   domestic violence.
The likelihood of prejudgment is increased when the accused fits the
profile of a person expected to be involved in illegal activity. Such
stereotypes are reinforced by media reporting, and can be compounded by
politicians willing to echo, rather than question, community
NRL players are often subject to such assumptions of guilt. Former NRL
star Hazem El Masri is an example. Despite an unblemished record as a
player, and a long history of community service, many were ready to
assume that allegations of domestic violence were well-founded.

   against him were dropped. Photo: Nick Moir
As El Masri has said (
): "A lot of people branded me guilty without even a presumption of
innocence beforehand … Everyone wants to jump on that bandwagon". The
result was "probably … the toughest thing in my whole life". The episode
has come at a great personal cost, even though he has now been
vindicated. The allegations against him have been shown to be false, and
the charges withdrawn by the police (
His case raises questions about how well we respect the notion that a
person must be treated as innocent until proven guilty. Known as "the
golden thread" of the criminal law, the presumption means that the
prosecution must prove the guilt of a person beyond reasonable doubt.
This enables our society to be underpinned by justice and fair
treatment. It acts as a crucial counterweight to the tendency to
The law must reflect this principle. Unfortunately, and increasingly, it
does not. For many years, parliaments around Australia have enacted new
statutes that erode the presumption of innocence. This in turn has
contributed to a growing community culture in which it has become more
acceptable to judge a person based upon media coverage and political
commentary, rather than on the basis of evidence assessed by a judge or
This problem is now so widespread that it was the subject of a speech
last month by the Chief Justice of NSW, Tom Bathurst. His survey of the
NSW statute book threw up more than just a few instances here and there.
The results were shocking in showing that breaches of the presumption
have become a routine part of the legislative process. His conservative
estimate was that there are at least 52 laws in the state that encroach
upon the principle. It is being whittled away, piece by piece.
One example is section 685 of the Local Government Act. It reverses the
presumption of innocence by making that mere allegations, such as that
someone has not received a council approval, is "sufficient proof of the
matter" alleged. In the words of the chief justice, this "renders
someone guilty of a criminal offence by a mere accusation".
Another example is section 60E of the Water Management Act. It says that
where water is taken without a licence, the occupier of the relevant
premises is deemed guilty of an offence. Remarkably, the act goes on to
state that this does not prevent proceedings being brought against "the
person who actually committed the offence".
Federal law provides many further examples. A long list is set out in
the report on traditional rights and freedoms released earlier this
month by the Australian Law Reform Commission. Some of the federal laws
that breach the presumption are in expected areas such as terrorism and
drug offences. Others relate to taxation, copyright and marriage.
The commission's report reveals that infringements upon the principle
are pervasive, and that many such laws are enacted without exciting
media attention or political debate. It has simply become common to
treat a person as being guilty unless they can show otherwise.
The consequences are enormous. It means that people can be imprisoned
where once they would have been let free. Bail laws have been tightened,
and prisons filled to overcrowding, on the basis that accusations should
more readily allow a person to be detained before trial. Despite this,
politicians are still prone to recite the mantra that a person is
innocent until proven guilty. At some point, such exhortations must ring
As the long list of laws breaching the presumption of innocence grows,
we are losing something fundamental and important from our system of
justice. A long-standing principle protective of individuals and the
truth is giving way to a regime based increasingly upon assumptions and
premature judgment. In the light of this, the treatment of El Masri
should come as no surprise.

There is also a certain saying which remains popular among the Arabs:
The Arabs have never taken quite so condemnatory an attitude towards the
practice, and indeed a popular Arab saying had it that "The pilgrimage
to Mecca is not complete without copulating with the camel."
"Our companions have said that if the penile head has penetrated a
woman's anus, or a man's anus, or an animal's vagina or its anus then it
is necessary to wash whether the one being penetrated is alive or dead,
young or old, whether it was done intentionally or absentmindedly,
whether it was done willfully or forcefully."
"If a woman inserts (in her vagina) an animal's penis she must wash, and
if she inserts a detached penis (thakaran maktu-an, lit. “a severed male
member”) there are two opinions; the most correct is that she must
"If he had sexual intercourse with an animal, that will not make his
hajj void"
"Sex with animals, dead people and masturbation, does not invalidate
one's fast provided ejaculation does not occur"
"Sex with animals before the mission (Islam) was wide spread and many
narrations are narrated that it is halal but makrooh (disliked). And on
the compulsory precaution one should abandon this practice that may
cause self harm. And you must admit this to the owner of the sheep and
pay the owner."
Islamic societies do not universally harbor negative attitudes towards
bestiality. Many Muslims seek out gratification or are indifferent to
this perversion, and in some cases it is even openly promoted and made

Feds Seize KickassTorrents Domains, Arrest Alleged Owner (Updated)
By Ernesto on July 20, 2016
The U.S. Government has arrested the alleged owner of KickassTorrents,
the world's largest torrent site. The 30-year-old Ukrainian was arrested
in Poland today and is charged with criminal copyright infringement and
money laundering. In addition, a federal court in Chicago has ordered
the seizure of several KAT domain names.
With millions of unique visitors per day KickassTorrents (KAT) has
become the most-used torrent site on the Internet, beating even The
Pirate Bay.
Today, however, the site has run into a significant roadblock after U.S.
authorities announced the arrest of the site’s alleged owner.
The 30-year-old Artem Vaulin, from Ukraine, was arrested today in Poland
from where the United States has requested his extradition.
In a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, the
alleged owner is charged with conspiracy to commit criminal copyright
infringement, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and two counts of
criminal copyright infringement.
 The complaint further reveals that the feds posed as an advertiser,
which revealed a bank account associated with the site.
It also shows that Apple handed over personal details of Vaulin after
the investigator cross-referenced an IP-address used for an iTunes
transaction with an IP-address that was used to login to KAT’s Facebook
“Records provided by Apple showed that [email protected] conducted an
iTunes transaction using IP Address 109.86.226.203 on or about July 31,
2015. The same IP Address was used on the same day to login into the KAT
Facebook,” the complaint reads.
In addition to the arrest in Poland, the court also granted the seizure
of a bank account associated with KickassTorrents, as well as several of
the site’s domain names.
Commenting on the announcement, Assistant Attorney General Caldwell said
that KickassTorrents helped to distribute over $1 billion in pirated
“Vaulin is charged with running today’s most visited illegal
file-sharing website, responsible for unlawfully distributing well over
$1 billion of copyrighted materials.”
“In an effort to evade law enforcement, Vaulin allegedly relied on
servers located in countries around the world and moved his domains due
to repeated seizures and civil lawsuits. His arrest in Poland, however,
demonstrates again that cybercriminals can run, but they cannot hide
from justice.”
KAT’s .com and .tv domains are expected to be seized soon by Verisign.
For the main Kat.cr domain and several others, seizure warrants will be
sent to the respective authorities under the MLAT treaty.
At the time of writing the main domain name Kat.cr has trouble loading,
but various proxies still appear to work. KAT’s status page doesn’t list
any issues, but we assume that this will be updated shortly.
TorrentFreak has reached out to the KAT team for a comment on the news
and what it means for the site’s future, but we have yet to hear back.

Good cause for hope I'd say, with the USA in its financial death throws,

presumably continue to want Russia's protection for the Leviathan oil
basin in the mediterranean sea, Turkey has well and truly begun its
rapprochement with Russia and will undoubtedly benefit from 'Turk
stream' pipelin into Europe, and the Saudi's now have a major roadblock
to any "aunti imperial" regime change operations they have lusted over
until now (stalemate in the desperately poor Yemen has turned to the
Yemenis now fighting back -into- Saudi Arabia (from what I hear, old
Yemeni lands that were "given" to Saudi Arabia when Yemen was at its
absolute weakest and was otherwise being land raped by the Saudi's and
their Western supporters)).
All in all, extremely positive (/ militarily stable) situations
developing all over the place.
Courtesy Russia.
Putin has the remainder of his current term in office and undoubtedly
one more term after this - here's truly hoping that Russia's subsequent
leader is at least half as functional re world affairs.
The only major caveat of course, is an overly hawkish USA president at
the upcoming North American federal elections.
And, unfortunately, this is a bloody big caveat!
I hope that the Eurasion alliances now forming, some mentioned above,
become strong enough in the next 2 months in the case that Hitlery

July 27th, 2016
Disobedience Has Its Award
Christine Hall
Civil disobedience gets its due with the creation of a special award
that was announced at last week’s Forbidden Research symposium at MIT.
News & Analysis
As one whose early early political education, after I was old enough to
quit listening to my father and think for myself, came largely from the
various civil disobedience factions in the 1960s, it’s heartening to see
that disobedience now has an award. So far it’s one off, but if
successful might be repeated and perhaps be awarded annually. The award
will also offer the recipient more than mere accolades, as it’s attached
to a $250,000 prize.
The MIT Media Lab Disobediance award was announced at Thursday’s
Forbidden Research symposium (
 ) at MIT and was
later the subject of a blog post by Joi Ito (
), the director of MIT Media Lab. The cash comes by way of a donation
from Reid Hoffman, the executive chairman of LinkedIn, who evidently has
some disposable cash after last month’s announced deal that will see
Microsoft taking control of the social site he co-founded for $26.2
According to Ito, the award “will go to a person or group engaged in
what we believe is excellent disobedience for the benefit of society.
The disobedience that we would like to call out is the kind that seeks
to change society in a positive way, and is consistent with a set of key
principles. The principles include non-violence, creativity, courage,
and taking responsibility for one’s actions. The disobedience can be
in – but is not limited to – the fields of scientific research, civil
rights, freedom of speech, human rights, and the freedom to innovate.”
Michael Petricone with the Consumer Electronics Association, has tweeted
a suggestion ( ) that the award be named in honor of hactivist Aaron Swartz.  On
Tuesday, Mike Masnick seconded that notion (
) on Techdirt. I’ll gladly throw my hat into that ring. MIT owes him at
least that much.

Many of us have been awake to the reality of the world being dominated
by a Cabal, using control of the media , banking and governments to wage
war on innocent people, all of it facilitated by a high level agreement
on “population control”, which has become an agreement to decimate
populations whenever possible using every policy that they (the Cabal)
can implement. At this point, in Cabal controlled countries, almost
every function of government, originally created to serve the public,
now serves the depopulation agenda. Healthcare, food production, law
enforcement, the judiciary, media and in the case of this Youtube video
the act of patriotism and defending one’s country has been subverted to
become a part of the doctrine of “continuous war” wherein troops are
deployed to defend their country under false pretenses and then
encouraged to believe everyone there is a “terrorist” or “insurgent”,
and that they should be killed under the flimsiest of pretexts.  When
they do, there is no accountability, other than being rewarded for doing
This has been the case since the Vietnam War and 911 triggered invasion

and the mind control they are subjected to.

May be ioerror got 'just desserts'. It does not look that way to me.
Also seems the "leak" war (using Wikileaks) going on between warring
factions in North America at the moment is a Good Thing (TM)(C)(R).
BUT, you may well be right that the harm being caused by USA, all around
the world, droning people to death day in and day out, is being fuelled
by their well funded tool Tor and that the balance is not in our favour.
Though I believe that the balance is certainly not in our favour, if you
have a North American establishment damaging leak, I think you owe it to
the world to get that leak out there, whether via Wikileaks or some
other mechanism.
I am barely hopeful for a "soft landing" for the world when the USA's
fiat dollar finally crashes. After the turmoil, it's possible we may see
some genuine improvements.

Depraved Clinton War Criminal Says Trump Will Destroy US Foreign Policy
Madeleine Albright openly condoned the slaughter of 500,000 Iraqi
CNN rolled out the old war horse Madeleine Albright on Tuesday to push
the Putin conspiracy angle on the DNC leak.
Albright told the convention Donald Trump had “already done damage” to
American foreign policy “just by running for president.” She said
defeating Trump would represent a defeat for Putin and the Russians.
  “Putin is eager to see Trump win, and that should worry every
  American,” she said. “Take it from someone who fled the Iron
  Curtain—I know what happens when you give the Russians a green
  light.”
  Secretary of Hate
The damage inflicted by Albright when she was “Secretary of Hate,” as
Bob Djurdjevic (  )
characterized her time at the State Department, is almost incalculable.
In 1998, as Bill Clinton unleashed cruise missiles on Iraq, murdering
dozens of civilians in response to Saddam Hussein thumbing his nose at
the United Nations, Albright declared: “If we have to use force, it is
because we are America. We are the indispensable nation. We stand tall.
We see farther into the future.”
In 2013, she admitted the bombing of Yugoslavia by her boss was illegal,
but decided it was fair. Clinton teamed up with NATO in 1999 and
conducted 38,400 sorties, including 10,484 strike sorties, in a terror
bombing campaign that lasted 78 days and destroyed infrastructure,
commercial buildings, schools, health institutions, media houses and
cultural monuments.
In addition to convincing Clinton to bomb Yugoslavia with depleted
uranium and cluster munitions to force Slobodan Milošević to sign the
Rambouillet peace accord, she pushed to send US troops to Bosnia,
according to the recollection of then Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Colin Powell.
Hillary Clinton celebrated the illegal attack. In October 2000, The New
York Times (
 )
reported Clinton “cited American involvement in Bosnia and Kosovo as
examples of foreign engagements she favored on moral and strategic
grounds.” Clinton urged her husband to bomb Yugoslavia without
congressional approval and said what “do we have NATO for if not to
defend our way of life?”
NATO also defended the way of life of the Kosovo Liberation Army, a
terrorist gang of ethnic Albanian separatists. The KLA effort for an
independent Kosovo supported by Albright and the United States
encouraged similar terrorist groups in the Balkans, the Middle East, and
Russia. The Kosovo precedent was responsible for inspiring Chechen
terrorists in Russia and the murder of scores of Russian citizens.
Career Achievement: 500,000 Dead Children
Albright’s crowning achievement, however, was the murder of half a
million Iraqi children under a brutal and medieval sanctions regime
imposed on the country by the United States and the United Nations.
  “We have heard that a half million children have died. I mean,
  that’s more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the
  price worth it?” asked Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes asked Albright in
  1996.
  “I think this is a very hard choice, but the price—we think the
  price is worth it,” Albright responded.
On Tuesday, the war criminal Albright warmed up the crowd for Bill
Clinton, described at the time of the Yugoslavia bombing raid by Edward
Herman as the world’s “leading active war criminal.”
The crowd was clueless about the magnitude of the crimes committed—and
those to be committed if Hillary Clinton wins. The corporate media once
again failed to note the complicity of Albright and Clinton in mass
murder and crimes against humanity, preferring instead to dwell on the
alleged DNC hacking by Vladimir Putin, an accusation without definitive
evidence that is now passed off as a fait accompli.

Trump Does The Unthinkable
Liz Crokin Posted: Jul 10, 2016 12:01 AM
Donald Trump is a racist, bigot, sexist, xenophobe, anti-Semitic and Islamophobe -- did I miss anything? The left and the media launch these hideous kinds of attacks at Trump everyday; yet, nothing could be further from the truth about the real estate mogul. As an entertainment journalist, I’ve had the opportunity to cover Trump for over a decade, and in all my years covering him I’ve never heard anything negative about the man until he announced he was running for president. Keep in mind, I got paid a lot of money to dig up dirt on celebrities like Trump for a living so a scandalous story on the famous billionaire could’ve potentially sold a lot of magazines and would’ve been a “yuge” feather in my cap. Instead, I found that he doesn’t drink alcohol or do drugs, he’s a hardworking businessman and totally devoted to his beloved wife and children. On top of that, he’s one of the most generous celebrities in the world with a heart filled with more gold than h!
 is $100 million New York penthouse.
In 2004, the first season of “The Apprentice” aired and at that time I worked as an entertainment columnist for the “RedEye Edition of the Chicago Tribune” and as a freelancer for “Us Weekly”. I had a gut feeling that Chicago contestant, Bill Rancic, was going to win the reality show. So I contacted him and covered the hit show the entire season. I managed to score an invite to New York for the show’s grand finale and after-party. This is where I first met Trump and got to ask him a few questions. That year, Rancic did win “The Apprentice”. I attended “The Apprentice” finale the next two years in a row. Between that and the frequent visits Trump and his family made to Chicago during the construction of their Trump International Hotel & Tower, I got a chance to meet most of his family too and I’ve had nothing but positive experiences with them. Since the media has failed so miserably at reporting the truth about Trump, I decided to put together some of!
  the acts of kindness he’s committed over three decades which has gone virtually unnoticed or fallen on deaf ears.
In 1986, Trump prevented the foreclosure of Annabell Hill’s family farm after her husband committed suicide.  Trump personally phoned down to the auction to stop the sale of her home and offered the widow money. Trump decided to take action after he saw Hill’s pleas for help in news reports.
In 1988, a commercial airline refused to fly Andrew Ten, a sick Orthodox Jewish child with a rare illness, across the country to get medical care because he had to travel with an elaborate life-support system. His grief stricken parents contacted Trump for help and he didn’t hesitate to send his own plane to take the child from Los Angeles to New York so he could get his treatment.
In 1991, 200 Marines who served in Operation Desert Storm spent time at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina before they were scheduled to return home to their families. However, the Marines were told that a mistake had been made and an aircraft would not be able to take them home on their scheduled departure date. When Trump got wind of this, he sent his plane to make two trips from North Carolina to Miami to safely return the Gulf War Marines to their loved ones.
In 1995, a motorist stopped to help Trump after the limo he was traveling in got a flat tire. Trump asked the Good Samaritan how he could repay him for his help. All the man asked for was a bouquet of flowers for his wife. A few weeks later Trump sent the flowers with a note that read: “We’ve paid off your mortgage.”
In 1996, Trump filed a lawsuit against the city of Palm Beach, Florida accusing the town of discriminating against his Mar-a-Lago resort club because it allowed Jews and blacks. Abraham Foxman, who was the Anti-Defamation League Director at the time, said Trump “put the light on Palm Beach – not on the beauty and the glitter, but on its seamier side of discrimination.” Foxman also noted that Trump’s charge had a trickle-down effect because other clubs followed his lead and began admitting Jews and blacks.
In 2000, Maury Povich featured a little girl named Megan who struggled with Brittle Bone Disease on his show and Trump happened to be watching. Trump said the little girl’s story and positive attitude touched his heart. So he contacted Maury and gifted the little girl and her family with a very generous check.
In 2008, after Jennifer Hudson’s family members were tragically murdered in Chicago, Trump put the Oscar-winning actress and her family up at his Windy City hotel for free. In addition to that, Trump’s security took extra measures to ensure Hudson and her family members were safe during such a difficult time.
In 2013, New York bus driver Darnell Barton spotted a woman close to the edge of a bridge staring at traffic below as he drove by. He stopped the bus, got out and put his arm around the woman and saved her life by convincing her to not jump. When Trump heard about this story, he sent the hero bus driver a check simply because he believed his good deed deserved to be rewarded.
In 2014, Trump gave $25,000 to Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi after he spent seven months in a Mexican jail for accidentally crossing the US-Mexico border. President Barack Obama couldn’t even be bothered to make one phone call to assist with the United States Marine’s release; however, Trump opened his pocketbook to help this serviceman get back on his feet.
In 2016, Melissa Consin Young attended a Trump rally and tearfully thanked Trump for changing her life. She said she proudly stood on stage with Trump as Miss Wisconsin USA in 2005. However, years later she found herself struggling with an incurable illness and during her darkest days she explained that she received a handwritten letter from Trump telling her she’s the “bravest woman, I know.” She said the opportunities that she got from Trump and his organizations ultimately provided her Mexican-American son with a full-ride to college.
Lynne Patton, a black female executive for the Trump Organization, released a statement in 2016 defending her boss against accusations that he’s a racist and a bigot. She tearfully revealed how she’s struggled with substance abuse and addiction for years. Instead of kicking her to the curb, she said the Trump Organization and his entire family loyally stood by her through “immensely difficult times.”
Trump’s kindness knows no bounds and his generosity has and continues to touch the lives of people from every sex, race and religion. When Trump sees someone in need, he wants to help.
Two decades ago, Oprah asked Trump in a TV interview if he’d run for president. He said: “If it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what’s happening with this country.” That day has come. Trump sees that America is in need and he wants to help – how unthinkable!

You may be right - I've only seen a couple of youtubes.
Notwithstanding even if Applebaum is a bad man, and or a lying CIA paid
scumbag, the lynch mobbing INjustice he has received is absolutely
deplorable, and must be denounced!

There are many anecdotes about Jacob Applebaum. Everyone is entitled to
draw their own conclusions about his true character.
His right to justice however, is as strong and as certain as the right
any of us has to justice, regardless of his true character and nature
and deeds.
We must never precondition an individual human's absolute right to
justice, and a just process of executing justice upon them, upon whether
we personally consider that person to be "good" or "bad" or anywhere
We must not be distracted from this fundamental!
It is any position we hold, or imply for that matter, that "that brown
person over there in the middle east is bad, and my opinion is all that
matters, outside of any just legal process" that leads to so-called
"rational" people (100s and 1000s of them in the USA military), choosing
to drone people to death, day in, and day out.
The USA's daily extra-judicial killings must be stopped. We must start
by acknowledging that "bad" people deserve the process of law as much as
"good" people.
Anything else is tyranny, sociopathy and ultimately war.

References: All tech which can be classified as infrastructure, will tend to "free
libre and open source" over the medium term (unit of time defining
'medium' is shrinking over time, at least for most software).
Even niche tech which has at least one dedicated hacker hobbyist, will
dominate a corresponding proprietary offering over the medium term.
Employee programmers choosing (when they have the choice) proprietary
over libre software, are simply yet to discover their true self interest
maximization potential (over the long term).
Once any proprietary tech is effectively monetized by an individual or
company with libre tech, they will over the medium to long term
completely dominate the company doing the proprietary tech.
The more individuals and groups/companies with an economic vested
interested in a particular libre tech, the faster that group will
accelerate away from any and all proprietary alternatives, over the
medium to long term.
Proprietary tech is merely a temporary historical anomaly, existing
pursuant to the lack of awareness of the relevant actors as to their
maximal self interest in the medium to long term.

@_subject: FM Corporations/ businesses/ entitities 
When > 1 humans associate for the purposes of shared economic activity/
incentive in what we may as well term "business", it is in their
interests to face the world as a named entity.
I think this is Georgi's point - in a FM we are free to associate with
one another as we so choose. So in Georgi's case here,
 FM corporation ~= business ~= economic activity association
And of course, where there is no government, there shall be no
"corporations" as created by governments. Any group calling themselves a
"corporation" would have a meaning different from the current meaning,
thus "FM corporation".
This leads to perhaps an interesting question:
Today there are many businesses, companies, corporations etc. which
entities represent their owners (possibly in the form of share holders)
and controllers (possibly just the owners, and/ or part owners, or the
directors/ managers employed to control certains aspects of the
Share holders/ owners can include other entities - trusts, hedge funds,
pension funds etc.
These entity owners have actual interests - economic interests, and any
other contractable/ name-able interest which might be written, but may
not be written, including for example:
 - simple economic interests - share dividends, perceived future share
   price for future sale etc
 - maturity of an estate, vesting from the estate holder to the named
   beneficiaries in a will
 - power and control structures as manifested by the CIA, FBI, NSA,
   North American BISMIC (banking intelligence surveillance/ spying
   military industrial control complex)
Contracts (explicit/ implied) - entities - interests (or rather
(Of course some interests would not be considered "lawful" or acceptable
to an average direct democracy/ anarchic voter (assuming that particular
interest were up for a vote) for example.)
THE QUESTION:
The question I think always shall be, is how to transition to an
anarchic society, in consideration of existing interests. I.e. how to
peacefully transition existing entities/ structure/ interests into an
anarchistic/ truly free market reality.
I am implying evolution. Revolution - we see how well that went after
the fall of the Tzar, to the various CIA instigated revolutionary coups
from Lybia to Syria, Ukraine to Yugoslavia, none of which resulted in
nor were intended to result in an actualisation of an anarchistic
The problem with revolution, is that it is ideological extremists who
give enough of a shit to pick up a gun and start shooting (for example)
police, citizens and government officials, and the outcome is that the
ideological extremists end up holding the seats of power and institute
something -other- than anarchism. Such extremists as our world's history
have seen, tend to sociopathy, rather than the benevolent, side of
We must always remember it is never the arm chair pundit ("oh I wish our
democracy elected representatives actually represented us") crowd who
will change the world.
So historically, revolutions seem to be more a devolution than an
evolution of the status quo. If you have counter examples, please
highlight them now.
So it is that I hold far greater hope for a better/ anarchistic/ direct
democracy type of future, via the pathway of evolution, and not
And so it is also that we owe it to our future generations to consider
pathways to peaceful transition of existing interests, into that better

The Road to Armageddon
A few quotes:
The roots of America’s current belligerence lie in the private ownership
of its currency, privatised by Woodrow Wilson in 1919, the now U.S.
Federal Reserve. Like any privatised business, the Federal Reserve
relies on a customer base, but as its customers dwindled, the future
consequences forced America into protection racketeering, and
manipulation to save its usury power. Today, this intervention
translates to regime change and removing those who won’t agree. In other
words, the U.S. produces dollars and the world peripheries produce to
sell for those dollars, consequently, this means the U.S. has been
living free by printing pieces of private profit-making paper for
"In 1973 (
) President Nixon asked King Faisal of Saudi Arabia to accept only US
dollars as payment for oil and to invest any excess profits in US
Treasury bonds, notes, and bills. In return, Nixon offered military
protection for Saudi oilfields. The same offer was extended to each of
the world's key oil producing countries, and by 1975 every member of
OPEC had agreed to only sell oil in U.S. dollars."
    In a world-wide economic recession, the world is finally beginning
    to realise the previous power of the U.S. lies not in
    exceptionalism, but in its parasitic nature. All this remains a
    conspiracy theory to many Americans, but well known to the rest of
    the world – Ron Paul explains (

Can only agree 100% - try telling your friendly 'magistrate' that you
are not accepting their jurisdiction except by evidence/ proof of
jurisdiction over you, in the petty "papers please" case they dragged
you to court for... say driving a car a little over the speed limit or
without your govt issued permission license to travel by that mode of
transport - it is very hard to hold ground, to not get railroaded in
the "conversation" between you and the Magistrate as s/he challenges
you straight back (which ought to have been left to the prosecutor at
least, showing bluntly that the magistrate has ganged up against you
on the police side of course) to not implicitly consent to --their--
jurisdiction as you try to field the blows (devious questions). It's

Better is a purely objective assessment of course with no rune for

"People are helpless"
Well, perhaps that's the mindset that results in the few who stand, only
to find that almost no one jumps on board.
Or perhaps I'm overestimating and you are not one of the few who stood, in
which case the only shame is that -you- did not stand with those who did.
Now here's a huge firetruckin irony: last year, or perhaps early this
year, slashd0t.0rg went through some management process of attempting to
monetize the site (again) in a way which some of the users (perhaps most)
really did not appreciate. This new website layout issue was evidently a
momentous human rights trigger, since saw quite a huge campaign from quite
a few members of that website, "troll" the beginning of the comments of
EVERY new article, to make their point, and they proclaimed they would not
stop until the website reverted to its old layout.
And wouldn't you know it? Within a couple weeks (don't quote me) of
sustained and diligent and united (amongst the protesters) action, they
got what they wanted and the weebsite was mostly reverted back to its old
But having your assets/ car /bank account/ life/ anonymity of travel to be

This is internet bullying, descended into an internet lynch mobbing,
descended further into physical net vigilante crimes.
The mindset allowing for such descent, and such crimes, I believe arises
from the not-handled suppression/ repression from our government organs.
When we don't handle the bully in our face (papers please show your
license, insert this piece of plastic into an orifice of your body so we
can verify your DNA^Bblood alcohol level, your bank account has just been
fleeced for your oustanding $3K of fines since that's all you had stashed
their and we will take the rest next time you pass, etc etc), we repress
ourselves. We have submitted to a bully, we have accepted by default
(tacitly) an injustice. We are leaving the problem to the next guy as
well, and to who knows perhaps our grandchildren. And the problem is, we
are not leaving the same problem, we are leaving a bigger problem because
the bully got a little bit more confident with his/her bullying.
There are state sponsored bullies, and there are individual bullies.
And the sense of powerlessness which arises since we let so many bullies
(mostly the state sponsored ones) prevail in our weekly lives, leving
these bullies "to the next guy", is a foundation which is ripe for YOU
jumping into a lynch mob!
"Oh look, a single non state sponsored individual who REALLY did something
wrong! Yeah let's crucify him! Crucify him now! I know the courts are
fucked and the police are corrupt, so we must crucify him/her NOW so we
can finally FEEL a bit of justice!"
Fact is, the foundation of a lynch mobber is one of intense cowardice.
The public cricifixion is nothing but a release valve, and the weak (non
state sponsored) individual target of the mob, pays a very high and very
public price for the cowardice of the many.
EVERY one must ask themselves, am I a coward? Am I not doing my part to
handle the bullies in my own life? Am I leaving the problems to the next
guy "who I'm so fucking grateful for, my heroes"?
When will I start living my part for the world I want to live in, which
starts in my own home, my own communities, my own country?
Or will I continue to cowardly leave shit to the next guy...

religious based government becomes quite intolerant of minorities, and
therefore a greater desire in the people for a separation of religion and

@_subject: the challenge of becoming an anarchist - why nearly everyone's a 
It seems that nearly everyone in this day and age is a statist to some
degree, Juan excepted :)
Why is this so, I have asked myself.
The state is a bully, and no one has escaped the experiences of being
bullied by the state - RBTs, license checks, seizing of bank accounts
outside of any court hearing nor any chance for the target to be heard in
a court of law with a righteous jurisdiction;
and anyway, the courts, that last bastion of freedom and justice against
the tyranny of the state, is almost completely, systemically,
instutitionally corrupt by any common man standard.
The state seizes taxes at every corner, violates our constitutions,
unilaterally attacks other states, and conspires year after year to
increase the burdens and the violations of its own constituents, namely we
the people.
The state (whether USA, Australia, etc) is nowadays so abhorrent, so in
violation of the constitution which created it, so outside of ethics,
morals, anything resembling higher causes or principles, it really is a
beast of epic proportion which must be slayed or transformed, or the
descent to total chaos war and bloodshed will once again happen, just
another war to end all wars.
Yet nearly everyone still clings to the state. Whether implicitly (it's
the best history has given us, other options would of course be so much
worse) or explicitly (driver licenses are our only hope to rid the world
of evil environment destroying cars).
'We' have lost faith in our fellow humans to a high degree. We don't trust
ourselves and so we don't trust our fellow 'citizens'. We put money,
creativity, leisure, life, family, mortgage and the rest before any higher
principle, in denial of the magnificence of that which we be, that which
we are, these incredible universes we stroll around in.
We expect "others won't stand behind me if I did take a stand against a
bully or a tyranny, because deep down I know I am probably unlikely to get
behind someone else taking a stand - especially since I haven't seen
myself do so yet, so I have no evidence suggesting I'm that way inclined,
so it's most likely true."
We hail the heroes "oh I think it's awesome that history proves that
someone comes along to fix things up every now and then - at a minimum on
average of every 400 years".
Yes this and endless more excuses for not supporing your local freedom
"fighters" even in a small way, fatalism is just one more excuse. I've
heard so many of them.
'We' live in golden cages. By historical standards, almost everyone in the
West can eat cheesecake every day, travel to friends and sights and events
one way or another, drape ourselves in silk and suede, or lounge on the
And the gold cage is never enough, the car or pushbike really needs to be
newer, faster, with better suspension, and I want more and my kids need to
go to more activities and events and and and... I have my life to live.
And the state redistributes the wealth of others to make our golden cages.
So we encage one another, binding our fellow man to tyranny,
binding ourselves to self serving, self centered, selfish non action.
Sleepwalking in comfort whilst the beast prepares its final meal.
Gee it's great that heroes come along and solve such problems in history
occasionally... now don't interrupt me whilst I shout down your Trump
rebellion and screem the benefits of The Democratic Platform
notwithstanding the evil that my state has become regardless.
Cowards most of us.

Problem is, "most important things", in almost all humans, fails to
include "actions which will in some (even small) way, bring forward some
correction or shift to my wayward state, in which I am in some small way a
party to".
0. Pick a cause.
E.g. - handling the inevitable descent into nazism of every fascist state,
which is every purported democracy today.
1. Name it.
E.g. "No More Papers Please!"
2. Communicate it. Online, in person.
3. Find those who are passionate about it and will form part of your "core
team" in this wayward t3rr0r1st group of extreme constitutionalists.
4. Invent some some slogans.
E.g. "Be radical, live our absolute right to give no more than our name to
any authority."
5. Perhaps water it down a bit, if you don't have enough takers,
E.g. "Be radical, live our absolute right to give no more than our name
and address as per section 51 of the Crimes Act 1971 (Australia), to any
authority." (Sorry, that section and year are not quite right, but the
details are otherwise correct, either download it from austlii.edu.au and
read it to find it, or reply and ask, if you can't find it.)
6. Make plans, take actions, build it, do it.
7. Know and teach that for a cause to truly impact beneficially in the
world, many individuals must carry it clearly in their words, with
certainty in their hearts. A single individual put on a leadership
pedestal, a Jacob, a Zenaan, a Juan or yourself, can and will be taken
down. EVERY individual must live the cause, the freedom, speak from his
own heart and carry the battle cry in a moments notice - only --then-- is
the cause truly won, truly owned by many, and earned by many, and
therefore able to persist.
Every single one of us, as flawed as we are, uncomfortable and unsure,
doubtful and embarrassed, every single one of us carries the capacity to
communicate in our body and mind, the capacity to be sincere, clear and
true in our minds and hearts.
The perception of greatness in an individual "out there", in the "glory"
of a public success, in the "exceptionalism" of an individual is a fast
way to excusing inaction, to clouding the mind and the heart, into denying
our equal potential as humans. All are unique and exceptional.
Even if you only get through steps 0 to 2 above, that's more than 99% of
people can generally say they've done in the past 10 years. Consider
renumbering the steps to begin with 1 when talking with non computer
programmers. Tech people may be a useful target demographic/ group -
freedom of speech, freedom of code, experience in working and
communicating with others, these days more "geek cred" than "nerd
aversion", so possibly tending toward influential in general, if not only
in the business and "silicon valley investor" set.
Good luck, and may your actions speak for you. Rock the world in your own
little way. Inspire others where possible. Do what we can. Amongst the
100s of causes and slogans, one may take off - and that's all that's
needed! Enjoy the ride.

society is a word which for the average person in conversation is used to
describe part of his reality in which he finds himself.
Taking one of the positions in the words above:
"your first obligation is ... finally none at all to 'society'..."
One way to tackle this position is to name it as the prisoner's dilemma:
do the prisoners each hold out for the others, and thereby maximise the
benefit to everyone, or jump at the first opportunity for individual
benefit, maximising the cost/pain to everyone.
I say this is a question of conscience. I encourage us all to live
according to one's own conscience, one's knowledge of good and evil, and
one's perception of right and wrong and how to improve things towards the
"good" end of the spectrum (again, according to your own personal
awareness of what is good).
We in the West are schooled, not so much educated, and our schooling is so
effective we do not see how brainwashed we are. "It's a dog eat dog world,
every man for himself, society/government are dubious constructs not much
related to reality and therefore to be ignored, focus on self and family
instead, be competitive, be number 1, win that human rat race and take the
podium and then you will have been successful in life."
I say this is competitive schooling^Wbrainwashing is driving us away from
our humanity, away from our conscience, and truly, away from those things
which actually bring happiness in life.
So many relatively wealthy or on the way to wealthy individuals here in
Australia spend their adult lives striving, so hard, for financial
success, to become that millionaire (and seriously, the papers, TV and
people talk about how really, even if you want to retire "comfortably",
you now need a MULTI million dollar retirement fund. That's right, just to
be comfortable AT RETIREMENT AND NOT BEFORE, you need to become a multi
I say this to people and they nod in agreement - the cost of living
comfortably is now so expensive. Seriously, it's now broadly accepted.
So, all these people, racing around for decades to becomes multis (multi
millionaires), a lifetime, only to discover at retirement that they need
to find some people to spend their "comfortable retirement" with.
Other folks, like some I know, take a different view, a different
approach, considering that it is most productive (from a sanity
perspective) to spend a good decade or two discovering people worthy of
spending time with, hanging out with, marching a cause with, and -then-
pursue a bit of "comfortability" in this world.
Then occasionally I find a real extremist who will put a righteous cause
and loyalty to friends who share the principles, even above family. Them's
worth hanging onto...
Please, choose words wisely.
As to action, if someone believe's their action is righteous and will
benefit others, and we believe such action will benefit at least some and
at least even in small ways, then let's support such action, even if we
encourage more effective action - with concrete suggestions of how to act
more effectively of course (don't need to belabour -that- point around
here now right?)...
Be a monk IN the world. A rebellious table turning, boat rocking, rock of
conscience type of monk, with care and graciousness to all, firm vehemence
and determination against bullies, love to family and friends and
consideration in our public voice. Who needs more depression? - let's

How Citizen Diplomacy Broke Through the Iron Curtain
One American woman determined to visit the USSR ignored US government
warnings and established more contacts and learned more about the country
than US officials had in decades
David Swanson
In the early 1980s almost nobody from the United States traveled to the
Soviet Union or vice versa. The Soviets wouldn't let anybody out, and good
Americans were disinclined to visit the Evil Empire. But a woman in
California named Sharon Tennison took the threat of nuclear war with the
seriousness it deserved and still deserves. She got a group of friends
together and asked the Russian consulate for permission to visit Russia,
make friends, and learn.
Russia said fine. The U.S. government, in the form of the FBI and USAID,
told them not to go, warned that they would not be permitted to move
freely once there, and generally communicated that they, the U.S.
government employees, had internalized their own propaganda. Tennison and
company went anyway, had a wonderful experience, and spoke at events with
slide shows upon their return, thus attracting many more people for the
next trip.
Now it was Tennison's turn to brief the flabbergasted and ignorant U.S.
government staff who had virtually no actual knowledge of Russia beyond
what she gave them. This was back in the day when President Ronald "Is
this a film or reality?" Reagan said that 20 million dead Americans would
be acceptable in a war. Yet the so-called intelligence so-called community
didn't know its assets from its elbows. War as a "last resort" was being
considered without having considered literally any other resorts. Someone
had to step in, and Sharon Tennison decided she'd try.
Those first trips took courage, to defy the U.S. government, and to
operate in a Soviet Union still monitored by a nasty KGB. But the
Americans went with friendship, were generally permitted to go wherever
they wanted, and encountered friendship in return. They also encountered
knowledge of cultural differences, the influences of history, political
and social habits both admirable and lamentable. They became, in fact, a
bridge between two worlds, experts on each for the other.
They expanded their work as Gorbachev came to power and the USSR opened
up. They hired staff and opened offices in both countries. They sponsored
and facilitated all variety of exchanges from art schools to Rotary clubs
to police officers to environmentalists. They began bringing Russians to
the United States as well as the reverse. They spoke all over the United
States, even -- in some examples Tennison gives in her book The Power of
Impossible Ideas -- converting gung-ho members of the U.S. weapons
industry into volunteers and staff (in one case a man lost his job at
General Dynamics as penalty for associating with them, but this freed him
to more closely associate).
Tennison's organization worked on sister cities, citizen diplomacy,
alcoholics anonymous, and economic development. The latter would, over the
years, become increasingly central and certainly focused on privatization
and Americanization in a manner that might well be criticized. But it was
not U.S. citizen diplomats who created the oligarchs of the 1990s or any
culture of oligarch admiration. In fact, Tennison and her philanthropists
made grants to Russians dependent on their making donations to others,
working to build a culture of philanthropy. Alcoholics Anonymous can also
be criticized, of course, but this was an effort to assist Russians with a
real problem, not to threaten them with nuclear annihilation. All of these
projects built relationships that have lasted and that have influenced
U.S. policy for the better.
Through the 1990s, the projects evolved to include food and financial
donations, orphanages, aid modeled on the Marshall Plan's Productivity
Tours, the creation of urban gardens and sustainable agriculture, and
numerous business-training initiatives. Tennison met Vladimir Putin before
he rose to power. She also met and advised top officials in the U.S.
government. She accepted huge grants from USAID, the agency that had
advised her never to begin her work. Of course, USAID has been involved in
coups and hostile propaganda around the world, and a closer look at that
problematic association might have been helpful in The Power of Impossible
Ideas. But the work Tennison describes was all for the better, including
taking U.S. Congressional leaders to dine in ordinary Russian homes. (I
wonder how many current U.S. Congress members have done that.)
I can't possibly recount all the amazing stories in Tennison's book, which
lives up to its vague and extravagant title; I strongly recommend you read
it yourself. The critical development in the later chapters is the
diversion Tennison encountered between reality and U.S. media. She found
Putin to be a force for reconciliation, and the U.S. media to be intent on
demonization -- at least from the moment that Russia refused to
participate in attacking Iraq in 2003.
Putin had tried to partner with the United States, challenging the demands
of Russian hardliners. He allowed the U.S. to use Russian bases in Central
Asia. He overlooked the United States withdrawing from the ABM treaty. He
accepted NATO expansion right to Russia's border. He supported, up to a
point, the U.S. "war on terrorism." Washington didn't care.
    "During the 2000s," writes Tennison, "I watched as the reservoir of
    goodwill from the Gorbachev/Reagan years evaporated." In 2004 the
    State Department cut off its funding for Tennison's work. In 2006 the
    Council on Foreign Relations produced a report hostile toward Russia.
    That same year, Russia gave the United States the 10-story-tall
    monument that stands in Bayonne, New Jersey, but it was too late to
    have the U.S. media inform many people of it. In 2007, the U.S. was
    pushing to get Georgia and Ukraine into NATO. Now, following the
    Ukrainian coup, the U.S. is seeking "partnerships" with NATO for those
    nations. The U.S. also announced its plans to put Ronnie's "Star Wars"
    into Poland and the Czech Republic, later changed to Poland and
    Romania.
Finally, Putin began pushing back, warning against aggression toward
Russia. In 2007, Tennison brought a group of 100 Russians to Washington,
D.C., to speak to Congress. But the hostility only increased. (By 2016
Pentagon staff would be openly saying (
) the motivation of this hostility is bureaucratic and profit-driven.) In
2008, Tennison and others in her organization (  )
launched a blog (  ) to correct bad
U.S. media. But with tensions growing ever worse (

she started and begun taking groups of interested Americans to visit
Russian cities and get to know members of the demonized foreign land.
These trips are as badly needed as they were in the 1980s, though they may
require less courage. In fact, what seems to me to require the most
courage, or the greatest delusion, is to not participate in this

"Hillary is a person so crazed that she declared the president of Russia
to be 'the new Hitler'"â
On the eve of World War II the United States was still mired in the Great
Depression and found itself facing war on two fronts with Japan and
Germany. However bleak the outlook, it was nothing compared to the outlook
Has anyone in Washington, the presstitute Western media, the EU, or NATO
ever considered the consequences of constant military and propaganda
provocations against Russia? Is there anyone in any responsible position
anywhere in the Western world who has enough sense to ask: âWhat if the
Russians believe us? What if we convince Russia that we are going to
attack her?â
The same can be asked about China.
The recklessness of the White House Fool and the media whores has gone far
beyond mere danger. What do the Russians think when they see that the
Democratic Party intends to elect Hillary Clinton president of the US?
Hillary is a person so crazed that she declared the president of Russia to
be âthe new Hitlerâ and organized through her underling, neocon monster

Ukraine. Nuland installed Washingtonâs puppet government in a former
Russian province that until about 20 years ago was part of Russia for
I would bet that this tells even the naive pro-western part of the Russian
government and population that the United States intends war with Russia.
Ever since Russia stood up to Obama over Syria, the Russians have been
experiencing hostile propaganda and military operations on their borders.
These provocations are justified by Washington and its NATO vassals as a
response to âRussian aggression.â Russian aggression consists of nothing
but obviously false assertions that Russia is about to invade the Baltics,
Poland, and Romania and recreate the Soviet Empire, the Eastern European
part of which, together with the former Russian provinces of Georgia and
Ukraine, now belong to the American Empire.
The Russians know that the propaganda about âRussian aggressionâ is a lie.
What is the purpose of the lie other than to prepare the Western peoples
for war with Russia?
There is no other explanation.
Even morons such as Obama, Merkel, Hollande, and Cameron should be capable
of understanding that it is extremely dangerous to convince a major
military power that you are going to attack. To simultaneously also
convince China doubles the danger.
Clearly, the West is incapable of producing leadership capable of
preserving life on earth.

Until the criminal regimes of Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama, American
presidents from John F. Kennedy forward worked to reduce tensions with the
Soviets. Kennedy worked with Khrushchev to reduce tensions caused by US
missiles in Turkey and Soviet missiles in Cuba. President Nixon negotiated
SALT I (the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty) and the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty. President Carter negotiated SALT II, which was never
ratified by the US Senate but was observed by the executive branch.
President Reagan negotiated with Soviet leader Gorbachev the end of the
Cold War. President George H.W. Bush in exchange for Gorbachevâs agreement
to the reunification of Germany promised that NATO would not move one inch
to the East.
All of these achievements were thrown away by the neoconized Clinton,

The economic picture is equally dismal and unpromising. The latest payroll
jobs report was even more awful than reported. Hardly any new jobs were
created, but what largely escaped reporting is the fact that the economy
actually lost 59,000 full-time jobs.
Increasingly the US economy consists of part-time jobs that cannot support
an independent existence. Thus, more Americans age 19-34 live at home with
parents than independently with spouses or partners. Fully half of 25-year
old Americans live in their childhood rooms in their parentsâ homes.
This is the âNew Economyâ that the filthy lying neoliberal economists
promised would be reward for the American work force giving up their
manufacturing and professional skill jobs to foreigners. What a monstrous
lie the neoliberal economists told so that corporate executives and
shareholders could put into their own pockets the living wage of the
American work force. These neoliberal economists, and, alas, libertarian
âfree marketâ ones, have not been held accountable for their
impoverishment of the American work force deeply buried in debt with no
future prospects.
Those few Americans who have any awareness are beginning to realize that
the One Percent and the western governments that serve them are
re-establishing feudalism. The brilliant and learned economist, Michael
Hudson, has labeled our era the era of neo-feudalism.
He is correct. The majority of young Americans come out of university
heavily indebted, primed for debtor prison. When half of 25-year olds
cannot marry and form households, how can anyone believe that housing
sales and prices are rising except as a result of speculative investors
banking on rental income from a population that cannot even pay its
student loans.
The United States is the sickest place on earth. There is no public or
political discussion of any important issue or of the multiple crises that
confront America or the crises that America brings to the world.
The American people are so stupid and unaware that they are capable of
electing a criminal and a warmonger like Hillary president of the United
States and be proud of it.
These âtoughâ Americans are so frightened of hoax dangers, such as âMuslim
terroristsâ and âRussian aggressionâ that they willingly sacrificed their
depleted pocketbooks, the Constitution of the United Statesâan act of
treason on the part of the American people who utterly failed their
responsibility to protect the Constitutionâand their own liberty to a
universal police state that has all power over them.
It is extraordinary that once-proud, once-great European peoples look for
leadership from a country of moronic non-entities who have pissed away the
liberty, security, and prosperity that their Founding Fathers gave to
Fellow Americans, if you care to avoid vaporization and, assuming we do
avoid it, live a life other than serfdom, you must wake up and realize
that your most deadly enemy is Washington, not the hoax of âRussian
aggression,â not the hoax of âMuslim terrorism,â not the hoax of âdomestic
extremism,â not the hoax of welfare bankrupting America, not the hoax of
democracy voting away your wealth, which Wall Street and the corporations
have already stolen and stuck in their pockets.

@_subject: In support of Spooner: dominion, and the Christian Bible as a legal 
Lysander Spooner's pamphlet on Natural Justice:
 "The Science of Justice"
 Quoting Spooner:
"If there be such a natural principle as justice, it is necessarily the
highest, and consequently the only and universal, law for all those
matters to which it is naturally applicable. And, of consequently, all
human legislation is simply and always an assumption of authority and
dominion, where no right of authority or dominion exists. It is,
therefore, simply and always an intrusion, an absurdity, a usurpation, and
a crime."
Quoting the King James Bible, Authorised Edition:
"1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and
let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping
thing that creepeth upon the earth.
1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he
him; male and female created he them.
1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living
thing that moveth upon the earth."
In Australia, our federal Constitution (the Commonwealth of Australia
Constitution Act 1901, clause 9), invokes the Blessing of Almighty God,
and references the bible, the King James Bible Authorised Edition to be
This foundation may be useful to those confronting a purported court.
There is likely a similar foundation in America.
By my understanding of Spooner, "natural law" and "natural justice" is
universal natural principal needing no statute to define it, which would
demonstrate a contradiction - if justice, right and wrong, requires a law
to define it, then it is no longer a natural / universal principal.
Our current predominant "shared common delusions" include courts, and
police carrying guns requiring we go to court (or arresting us and taking
us there by physical force).
So we face the current reality of our society as it is, not as we would
like it to be.
It is in this context that getting back to the foundations of the founding
fathers, and the principles of natural justice and dominion, and making
use of those documents held in some regard and referenced, and at the very
foundation of our constitution (at least here in Australia) by our
founding fathers, namely the King James Bible, may have a utilitarian
value in handling the current reality we face ourselves within.
It's perhaps a great blessing that Spooner never finished his voluminous
treatise on natural justice, since this pamphlet, the limit of his
treatise, is so short even a slow reader with attention deficit disorder
has hope to focus for long enough, over a few sittings, to get through
this short list of paragraphs. I suggest this Lysander Spooner's pamphlet
be required reading for all and sundry. Help spread the word - I shall.

@_subject: synchronicity - historical quotes on Natural Justice 
Just received the below from a totally different channel. It's in the air.
1722 seems to be missing a word, perhaps "possessions"?
1859 omits "or for the restitution of a damage caused by him to another"
otherwise we're saying once a crime (e.g. of theft) has occurred, no
restitution is permitted in natural law, which I would (hopefully
obviously) disagree with.
   300s BC Epicurus
          Natural Justice is a symbol or expression of usefulness, to
          prevent one person from harming or being harmed by another.
   900s Islamic Theologians
          Man can rationally know that man has a right to life and property.
   1689 John Locke
          Being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in
          his life, health, liberty, or possessions.
   1682 Samuel von Pufendorf
          Among the absolute duties of anybody to anybody, the first place
          belongs to this one: let no one injure another. For this is the
          broadest of all duties, embracing all men as such.
   1722 William Wollaston
          No man can have the right to begin to interrupt the happiness of
          another yet every man has a right to defend himself and his
          against violence
   1790 Mary Wollstonecraft
          The birthright of man is such a degree of liberty, civil and
          religious, as is compatible with the liberty of every other
          individual
   1816 Thomas Jefferson
          Rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will
          within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I
          do not add within the limits of the law because law is often but
          the tyrants will, and always so when it violates the rights of
          the individual.
          No man has a natural right to commit aggression on the equal
          rights of another, and this is all from which the laws ought to
          restrain him.
   1851 Herbert Spencer
          Every man is free to do that which he wills, provided he
          infringes not the equal freedom of any other man.
   1859 John Stuart Mill
          The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised
          over a member of a civilized community, against his will, is to
          prevent harm to others.
   1961 Ayn Rand
          The precondition of a civilized society is the barring of
          physical force from social relationships
   1963 Murray Rothbard
          No one may threaten or commit violence (aggress) against another
          mans person or property. Violence may be employed only against
          the man who commits such violence; that is, only defensively
          against the aggressive violence of another. In short, no
          violence may be employed against a non-aggressor. Here is the
          fundamental rule from which can be deduced the entire corpus of
          libertarian theory.
   L. Neil Smith
          No one has the right, under any circumstances, to initiate force
          against another human being, nor to delegate its initiation.
   Walter Block
          It shall be legal for anyone to do anything he wants, provided
          only that he not initiate (or threaten) violence against the
          person or legitimately owned property of another.

Indeed. I gnashing my teeth here and there over those dang humans, so very
few can be trusted to behave rationally, let alone without the negative
aspects of the mind and emotion - vindictiveness, anger, spite, envy,
greed, lust, lynch-mobbingness etc.
An immediate transition, say removal of the state, would probably descend
into gangs exacting vigilante justice on each other, causing a lot of
damage, collateral damage, to humans and property, before eventually they
figure out (if they/ the majority do figure anything out) that sanity
requires a basic procedure of "do unto others as you'd have them do unto
you" and therefore a justice procedure which involves more than just "go
bash the shit out of the person your mate says did the wrong thing".
An external authority is indeed probably required with the current state
of schooled humans, to educate them on internal authority and how best to
exercise that, such as to syndicate in an objectively self interested way.
Lynch mobbing demonstrates that most humans don't get past their first
thought to a second thought. That's just asking a lot... evidently.
So practically I believe we are left with attempts to create enclaves of
like minded individuals - syndicates of self interested humans, limited in
number, acting in mutual self interest, learning how to handle the
different natures of one another.
I do believe we are stuck with the state for the short to medium term, and
I'd hate to see the last 20 years of US hegemonic demonic domination of
the planet had Russia completely disintegrated with Yeltsin.

I think they are exceptionally pragmatic. So US offers some guns to fight
some undesirable (to US) rebels over yonder, who the Kurds also happen to
dislike, so they take the guns, get the job done, then the US drops them
publicly or reneges on further support - of course they are going to
continue to fight to protect their lands, homes and people.
Then the US comes along again, offers a bit more since there is again some
political alignment, so of course there is some cooperation. Seems
entirely rational to me...
Wow. That's really amazing. The 'power' of magic eh..
Here's another one which may interest those on this topic:
How Syrian Kurds dropped Marx and adopted communalism
by Claudio Gallo
Debbie is not only the daughter of Murray Bookchin (
 ), the theorist of
Communalism. She is a journalist and writer: in 2004, she wrote, together
with Jim Schumacher, âThe Virus and the Vaccine: Contaminated Vaccine,
Deadly Cancers, and Government Neglectâ about the polio vaccine scandal.
She served as presidential candidate Bernie Sandersâ press secretary from
1991-1994. But, yes, she is also her fatherâs daughter, spreading the
legacy of the American philosopher born from Jewish Russian parents
emigrated to the United States.
Kobane, all threw Marxism over their shoulders  to embrace your fatherâs
philosophy: Communalism. What is Communalism?
Communalism is the idea that democracy works best when citizens make
decisions together on the local level, in assemblies. They meet
face-to-face with their neighbors and discuss issues of importance to
their communities. They send recallable delegates to councils to make
regional decisions; but power always resides at the local level, rather
than with the nation-state. My father believed that these local assemblies
would transform, and be transformed by, an increasingly enlightened
citizenry. People could reclaim and redefine politics as something we do
for ourselves rather than just voting for someone and hoping for the best.
Communalism also envisions what my father called a âmoral economyâ in
which people make collective decisions about how to use natural resources
for economic production, with the ecological impact in mind.
In this vision there is no money, no market: how is it possible?
Today we take capitalism for granted. But God didnât ordain capitalism. In
much of human history societies functioned without it. As my father first
pointed out in the early 1960s, capitalism is on a collision course with
nature that threatens our survival as a species. Capitalismâs âgrow or
dieâ ethos demands the ceaseless exploitation of natural resources. The
rapacious growth and individualism that it has fostered has led to global
warming, that is on the verge of making our planet uninhabitable for our
grandchildren. Is capitalism so sacred that we are willing to destroy the
planet for future generations? There are many examples in history of
people working cooperatively to make decisions for the benefit of a
community without using money â from primitive societies to large Israeli
kibbutzim. Communalism assumes that in a free society, people with
different skills, interests, and desires, will contribute their labor to
the well being of society. And given the advanced technology of the modern
age, it means that we would all have to work less and have more leisure
time than we do today.
What do you think is so remarkable about Rojava (the Kurdish area of
The Kurds have created a society that fully empowers women and people of
every ethnic and religious plurality to work together in charting the
future of their communities. Their economic planning is ecologically
sensitive and they are practicing the most democratic form of government
there is on the planet, all under conditions of war. It is truly
How did Communalism make its way to the Kurdish land?
When Kurdish leader Abdullah Ãcalan was sentenced to life imprisonment, he
was brought many books by his lawyers, including some of books by my
father like The Ecology of Freedom and From Urbanization to Cities, which
had been translated into Turkish. Ãcalan had become increasingly
disillusioned with a Marxist-Leninist approach that had led to three
decades of warfare with the Turkish state; he believed that by employing
my fatherâs ideas Kurds could achieve self-rule and true democracy even
while remaining within the borders of Turkey. But while Ãcalanâs concept
of Democratic Confederalism incorporates my fatherâs thinking, Ãcalan, has
contributed many original ideas, for example, particularly emphasizing the
role of women.
Which is the strongest criticism that you father had against Marx?
Murray Bookchin
My father had enormous respect for Marx, but he felt that modern day
Marxists were living in the past and that we had to go beyond âclass
analysis,â and the tactics employed by revolutionaries in the 1930s, and
examine why workers had not, in fact, made a revolution. He rejected the
idea of workers or the proletariat as the âhegemonic class,â and argued
that social change today will only come about if we appeal to people as
citizens of their communities who share a common desire not just for
income equality but for clean air and water, safe food, and an end to all
forms of hierarchy and oppression, be it of race, ethnicity, gender, etc.
He also saw that socialism hadnât led to freedom in the Eastern European
countries and felt that power had to be decentralized and located at the
municipal level, not in a centralized party apparatus.
Despite the ideal of Communalism, the Syrian Kurds were accused by Amnesty
International in 2015 of destroying Arab households: you wrote an article
in which you questioned those charges.
I think that as exciting as it is to see the remarkable social project
unfolding in Rojava, under conditions of war mistakes will be made; they
must be acknowledged and corrected. But there were a number of questions
raised about the evidence they cited, including the veracity of those they
interviewed and the failure to corroborate some anecdotes. Many people
felt it lessened the credibility of that report.
Communalist Kurds and Washington together against the IS: a strange
coalition, isnât it?
It should be a natural coalition because the USA and EU promote themselves
as champions of democracy. However, while the West recognizes that the
Kurds are their best ally in fighting Isis, the USA and EU are also
fearful that Turkey will open its doors and allow migrants to enter
Europe. So they bowed to Turkey and have excluded Rojava representatives
from the Geneva talks about the future of Syria. They have turned a blind
eye to the ways Turkey assists ISIS and to the Turkish military
bombardment of the Kurdish towns of the southeast â in which the military
has killed hundreds of innocent civilians, including children, under the
pretense of searching for PKK terrorists. If they really believe the
democratic values they claim, the US and EU should invite Rojava
representatives to the Geneva talks and encourage the expansion of the
Rojava model throughout Syria so that a peaceful, democratic solution can
be reached which will allow people to stay in their homes instead of
having to flee.
The idea of an autonomous Kurdish region has to come to terms with Turkish
hostility: there will be another war in the near future?
I am a journalist, not a Middle East analyst, so itâs hard for me to
predict if there will be an all-out war. My personal feeling is that
people are very justified in worrying that President Erdogan is heading
down the path of dictatorship. An authoritarian regime will only spark
more unrest and instability, which is bad for the people in the region and
harms our efforts to defeat ISIS. It is my deepest hope that Western
leaders will use the substantial leverage they have to demand an end to
Recep Tayyip Erdoganâs violence against the Kurdish people and insist on a
return to peace negotiations. It is clear that the âKurdish Questionâ
cannot be solved militarily and that the sooner Erdogan resumes
negotiations the better it will be for all of Turkish society and the rest
of the world.

An American Sioux flees America to find freedom and a new life in Russia
Alexei Ovchinnikov
Simon North
A Native American from South Dakota, USA, has left the land of the free to
find what he considers to be true freedom in Russiaâs countryside.
The narrator notes the physical resemblance of Justin Irwin, or Big Wolf,
to his Sioux warrior ancestors as described by adventure novelists of the
time like Thomas Mayne Reid and James Fenimore Cooper:âQuite a hard face
with an aquiline nose, strong chin, high cheekbones and dark hair in a
plait at the nape of his neck.â
As to what removed Big Wolf from his native prairies to place him in the
Russian hinterland, Irwin bewails the place of money in American culture
and the corporatism it entails, leading to what he describes as a fascist,
police state.

Notice there are many cheeky things going on, besides the fact that it was
sent to a non-existent email address (I have not included that line, not
wanting extra spam of course) which was my first giveaway.
Then there's the extra cheeky List-Unsubscribe email header (and it was in
a link in the bottom of the email too) - for all I know, this email could
be an initial part of a spam sequence - this first email is just
canvassing say 10 million email addys, to see who clicks on at least ONE
of the links in this sort-of-reasonable sounding email "oh, these guys
must have sent the email by mistake to me, looks like they handle spam,
I'll click the unsubscribe link so they don't mistakenly email me again".
Yeah right!!
But wait! this list-unsub link begins with a hash of some sort, not just
the (non-existent/ fake) email address to which this spam email was sent
to. Again, by itself not necessarily nefarious.
Next, the observant might notice the millisends on the date stamp, which
does not necessarily say this is spam, but adds to the picture.
Also, the name that this "letter" addresses begins with a lowercase, is
misspelt, clearly is addressing at best an email address and not a person,
and at best best, has been scoured since there is no family name.
The content, if legitimate, is definitely spam - "Spam Digest is a short
report sent via email to the administrator OR YOUR END USERS". Oh, it must
be ok, I'm just an end user, my administrator must really want me to view
this video.
And finally, it is spam - it's neither appropriate nor legitimate for a
spam filtering company to spam the users belonging to the administrator
who installs and manages such a product to protect his/her users from spam
- well, no administrator worth his salt anyway :)
And so on and so on...
May you have a lovely and spam minimized day :)
P.S. It's really a damn good thing I'm on our side of the fence and not
doing the low level dirty work of spam propagation - if I were me, I'd
really hate being on the receiving end of the cunning I'd dish out.

Debian is not, and never has been, about justice.
Debian developer voting base has public foundations which fail to have any
separation of powers - just a single public "community" executive/ power of
authority, with no formal nor rigorous nor easy to identify appeal/ right
of reply/response process.
Debian is not about human rights.
Debian is not about justice.
Without foundations of human rights and justice, Debian fails
fundamentally to provide an effective --long term-- foundation for
effective community.
Debian is about their operating system/ software distribution and
packaging, and the whims of the developers who are the only ones who get
to vote on anything.
See Debian's Social Contract, which is all about (free libre) software,
its utility and benefits, and even their "3. We will not hide problems"
clause is purely utilitarian and software based, and has nothing to do
about humans, rights, justice nor ethics! :
and Debian's Code of Conduct :
Debian fails to have any of:
   -  due process
   -  separation of powers
   -  right to respond
   -  right to appeal
   -  ethical foundation
   -  principled foundation other than utility
And before you leap in with an excessively quick "oh, you can respond,
just send an email" - take notice, if it is not written into the
foundation rights, there is no such right in operation in Debian!
So take your false beliefs and read Debian's foundation documents again
before embarrassing yourself publicly.
Fundamentally, with only a "be excellent to each other" hippy ethos,
tyranny can (and I say in the long term shall) reign supreme; despots can
hide, well intentioned idiots can pave abundant roads to hell, and all
without realising their mistakes nor the years of damage to their hailed
"community", since that damage is predominantly unseen.
Debian is no friend to ethics nor justice nor fundamental community
building principles - nothing more than the grandiose principle of

References: <82802cd6-e80a-5fdc-4b17-6d89fac1dfe7
It's foundation design issues. And hardware level network issues.
The code is generally (in the public conversation anyway) assumed to be
"best effort, bugs fixed relatively soon after they arise".
Again, you will need more nuance than "has the code been audited" if you
really want a relevant answer.
There's a lot of research out there, and also logic and discussions which
are straightforward to follow.
Next, once you've done some investigation, you start to come across a few
interesting factoids of note such as:
- lack of network chaff is a fundamental limitation, and problem for
  privacy (for those who need it) given current known data collection
  capabilities of the "five eyes" - all network meta data, and there is
  evident (I'm not about to search the lists, but you only need to search
  2.5 years (the time I've been watching)) resistent within "Tor project
  proper" to making this particular fundamental improvement happen;
  - arguments are put such as "oh there are no studies proving the
  benefits of network chaff" and the obvious "we don't have a budget for
  that (yet) but we encourage contributions"
- persistent push back against bittorrent over Tor, including threatening
  offlist email attacks against those who suggest as much;
  BT over Tor would provide some chaff, simply by increase of volume,
  load, unpredictability of end clients, for example.
- just watching TBB's behaviour has been interesting - some days, when I
  open up say 5 tabs for 5 different news websites using the "open all
  bookmarks from this folder as tabs" function, they all essentially start
  to load simultaneously, but other days/times, each tab loads distinctly
  sequentially, which to my mind is a dead giveaway that my current
  on-ramp is part of some sort of profiling (read 'deanonymising')
- configurable latency randomization is another technical improvement
  which has been bandied around for years, and sounds easy to my
  programmer mind in practice, but has yet to see anything like the light
  of day
There is ample room for an alternate dev team. Unfortunately, the US DoD
are the ones providing almost all the funding, so they get to continue to
control Tor development. If you are a big funder, start a whole new dev
team, in a -completely separate jurisdiction (if that's possible). I know
of an apparently well intentioned and productive man who may be close to
ideal to set up and lead such a team :)
Also, fundamentally we need a physical layer network which individual
humans in their homes and offices, actually control - that is, shift the
entire network to a "dark fibre" concept, where suburbs have random
connections to one another, neighbours connect to one another with
ethernet, wireless and more.
If you don't own it, you don't control it.
If you don't control it, it --will-- be used against you.
This is a long term (say 20 year) plan, but it's the only long term option
if we want to achieve anything resembling a genuine network of the people
which honours privacy and anonymity of communication.
By virtue of our capacity and existence and by the blessing of our
cognizance of these things, we humans are with the right to anonymous and
private communication.
We have the right. I encourage you to work towards a world where many can
live the right.

Soros Complains Russia Now 'Global Power' While EU 'Falling Apart'
Has the billionaire regime-change architect finally admitted defeat?
A dejected George Soros confessed yesterday that not all is proceeding
according to his grand design.
 Photo: Business magnate George Soros arrives to speak at the Open Russia
 Club in London, Britain June 20, 2016
Attending a London pow-wow with fellow Russia-haters, the world's most
infamous private "democracy" promoter had this to say, according to
Reuters (  ):
   Billionaire investor George Soros said on Monday he saw Russia emerging
   as a global power as the European Union collapses, in much the same way
   as the EU flourished when the Soviet Union started falling.
   Soros added that he felt "more than ever" that the EU's destiny hinged
   on Ukraine's future, speaking in London at an event hosted by the Open
   Russia, a Russian opposition movement founded by Kremlin critic Mikhail
   Khodorkovsky.
So the future of the European Union hinges on a bankrupt, failed state run
by oligarchs, Nazi militia, mafia and general psychopaths (
). I'm sure the French, Germans, and Italians are gratified to hear that.
Somehow I think they probably disagree.
European nations have lost billions in trade with Russia since the
introduction of sanctions - which they are apparently renewing (
) once again at Washington's demand. If this is the future they will be tied to, all the more reason for the
British to vote to leave the EU on June 23.
But Soros hasn't given up on the EU dream completely - he wrote (
 ) in The Guardian today
attempting to scare British voters that going through with Brexit will
collapse the pound. Soros is probably growing frustrated at the increasingly hard time he is
having at building the new world order he wants. Russia's not cooperating,
and populations in Europe are supporting EU-skeptic parties while American
voters are supporting Trump.
Here's hoping he meets continued disappointment. His misfortune is the
world's gain.

How the Russian World Differs From the Ideals of Western Civilization
The Russian ideal is more benevolent, contrasting noticeably with the
historical Western hankering to dominate, subdue and exploit
Anna Zhdanova
(Oriental Review)
 Image: A noble warrior
Originally appeared at Oriental Review
In recent years, both the Western as well as the liberal Russian press
have had a lot to say about Russian âbarbarianism,â as if to contrast it
with European âcivilization.â But a closer inspection â through the prism
of the heroic pages of Russian history â of the two groupsâ moral ideals
and actual lives presents us with quite a different picture.
For example, in pagan times, ancient Russians never worshipped a god of
war, although their contemporaries in Europe were transfixed by their own
martial deity, constructing an entire epic narrative around the concepts
of war and conquest.
After defeating the âinfidelsâ (the Golden Horde), Russians never sought
to forcibly convert them to Christianity. In the epic poem âIlya Muromets
and the Pagan Idol,â the Russian hero liberates Constantinople from that
mythological monstrosity, but refuses to become the voevoda (or ruler) of
the city and returns home. Ancient Russian literature does not include
tales of personal enrichment through conquest or plunder, although this is
a common theme in the Western canon.
The hero of the âNibelungenliedâ is obsessed with his search for a hidden
treasure â the Rheingold. The main character of the ancient English poem
âBeowulfâ dies, having beheld âthe gorgeous heirlooms, golden store â¦ Now
Iâve bartered here for booty of treasure the last of my life.â It would
never occur to any hero from a Russian epic to sacrifice his life in
exchange for riches. Ilya Muromets is not even able to accept the
inducement offered by the brigands he meets â the âgolden treasure, richly
colored robe, and as many fine horses as he neededâ (citation from the
Russian fairytale (  ) âIlya
Muromets and Nightingale the Robberâ).  He did not hesitate to reject the
path by which he would âbe rich,â instead voluntarily taking the road on
which he would âbe killed.â
And it is not only in this epic, but also in the legends, tales, songs,
proverbs, and folk wisdom of the Russian people where it is evident that
oneâs duty to uphold oneâs personal or tribal honor is something quite
distinct from any duty to exact personal or tribal revenge.
The notion of retaliation, as such, is absent from Russian folklore, as if
it were never part of the original âgenetic codeâ of its people â the
Russian champion has always gone to war as a liberator. And in this we can
see the difference between Russians and Western Europeans.
The Russian historian and philosopher Ivan Ilyin (
    âEurope cannot grasp us â¦ because the Slavic and Russian way of
contemplating the world, nature, and man is something alien to it.
Humanity in Western Europe is motivated by will and intellect. The Russian
people are above all guided by their hearts and imaginations, relegating
the mind and will to a supporting role. Therefore, the average European is
ashamed of sincerity, scruples, and kindness, viewing them as
A European, nursed on the ideals of Rome, is secretly contemptuous of
other nations and desires to rule over them. Russians, however, on the
whole expect kindness, scruples, and sincerity from others.
The Russian people have always enjoyed the natural freedom of the vast
space they inhabit â¦ gazing âin wonderâ at other nations, getting along
with them amiably, with hatred only for oppressive invaders â¦ â
Russiansâ congenial relationships with their geographic neighbors are
testament to their sense of justice and mercy. The Russian people never
committed the same atrocities for which the enlightened Europeans were
responsible in their own conquered lands.
The psychology of the nation includes a certain principle of moral
restraint. These naturally strong, resilient, dynamic people have been
endowed with an amazing ability to survive.
This spiritual strength is also the basis for Russiansâ renowned
forbearance and tolerance toward others.
Continually invaded from all sides and forced to live in an incredibly
harsh climate, the Russian people managed to colonize vast swathes of
land, but without slaughtering, enslaving, robbing, or forcibly baptizing
any nation.
Western Europeansâ policies of colonialism annihilated the aboriginal
populations on three continents and forced natives from across Africa into
slavery, while its cities grew rich on the backs of those colonies.
The Russian nation, which also waged wars that were not purely defensive,
acquired, like all great nations, large tracts of land, but never treated
their conquered subjects as the Europeans did. The European people reaped
the benefits of Europeâs conquests and its cities were enriched by the
colonial plunder.
Russians robbed neither Siberia nor Central Asia nor the Caucasus nor the
Baltics. Russia has preserved every nation within its borders, acting as
their protector, granting them the right to own land and property and to
practice their own faith, traditions, and culture.
Russia has never been a nationalist state â it has belonged to all who
inhabit her. The Russian people were granted only one âadvantageâ â to
bear the burden of nation-building.
The resulting state was like no other in the history of the world, and the
Russian people defended it with their own blood, willingly sacrificing
their very lives.
Precisely because they have borne so much suffering and heavy sacrifice,
my people deeply empathized with the pain and suffering of other peoples
languishing under the Nazi yoke.
And after liberating their own homeland, Russians channeled that same
spirit of self-sacrifice and energy into liberating half of Europe.
This was an example of epic heroism! These are the stouthearted people
born of the Russian earth! And I believe that such a feat can be
accomplished even by a great nation only once a century.
The patriotism displayed by Russian soldiers in the fields of the Great
Patriotic War met the highest ideal of patriotism â something
unprecedented in the history of any nation anywhere in the world. And I
will never agree with the mediaâs pronouncements about Russian
âbarbarianismâ vs. European âvirtue.â
I stand proud that our ancestors â our heroic ancestors â were so lovely,
steadfast, courageous, and resilient, and that we are their descendants!

Trigger warning and Punk anarchist apostasy alert: the following question
may be considered entirely blasphemous to punk tradition!
Prior attempts to put the following concept have been downright clumsy,
thus the following:
1) A significant portion of the adult humans in America might be
   considered part of the so-called "bible belt".
2) One foundation of any sane community is the right of a human to
   grow his own food and any other plant, for medicinal or other
   purposes (personal enjoyment, to trade with others, etc)
3) A document called the King James Bible (one random example), speaks
   to this fundamental human right, in a way which certain adult humans
   can receive as, well let's just call it "the gospel truth."
The question:
   Ought we reject outright all passages in such a document on any grounds
   of personal preferred vehemence such as including but not limited to
   the grounds of superstition, historical abuse, unnecessary
   externalization of authority, or any and other such grounds,
   or ought we, for the purposes of communicating with certain of our
   fellow adult humans regarding such a fundamental human right (which
   right must be upheld for any community or society to call itself just,
   righteous, sane and etc) ought we highlight those particular passages
   in said document, in support of said fundamental human right?
(If the latter, humorous slogans give rise to themselves such as for
example "Be truly punk, get down and rock it with the King James Bible!")

Seems those truly selfless in their nationalism (/ anarchism/ or etc)
ultimately cede the actual seats of power to others. And those others end
up being less than selfless.
It's a dichotomy just begging to be resolved, perhaps ever unresolvable?
When the selfless in service, retire to their normal average life, the
joys, loves and heartaches of family for example, and the seats of power
then wielded by those who desire such, the cycle of tyranny once again
begins. "Who wants to be involved in politics? I just want to live my
creative/ productive life thank you very much!"

There is room in the world for private or semi-private clubs where the
democracy of the club prevails. The benefit of this over capital-D
democracy, as Juan has succinctly pointed out wrt the Debian example, is
that no one HAS to join that club. I don't HAVE to die for the cause of
Debian, and on top of it, I can fork as much of the code and do with it
as I want/ am able.
So these private clubs, I think they can be useful for people. I think
of AA as another example (Alcoholics Anonymous) - useful for some
people, private (members only) but open to anyone joining if they need
or want, but also probably subject to security - getting the boot if you
are destructive to the rules of that private club.
I'm ok with groups having their private clubs, or semi private/ semi
Although I object to some of the "democratic foundations" of Debian, I
am ok with the Debian developers continuing to choose to have their
private little free software democracy club - that's just not for me.
I roll to Juan's "if someone's got something to say, they're allowed
to damn well say it" side of the street.
I hear that you learned some wisdom, and I can see how cowardliness
could exist coincident with wisdom, although I would personally not
juxta those two realities as part of the same adjective for a person's
actions - if it's cowardly, that's the end of it for me, it's a cowardly
Again, marginal cost of online discussion group is as good as zero.
Why should we hold against you, your desire for or participation in a
moderated online discussion group?
For me that's an equation like  "1 + orange = flying".
Now, for foundations for robust broader "community"/ national "society",
this is another matter entirely - we need fundamental human rights to be
respected very strongly, for a strong society potential.
We need the right to create and live "hard core free speech" forums, we
need "the right to free and anonymous travel on the commons", we need
these and more!
And having strong foundations does not remove the right for small/
medium or large groups to form their own (semi) private clubs (if
they're useful for you, healing for others, comforting for some, go
for it, create as many private clubs as your heart desires).
"Strong public rights, is not contradictory to private clubs."
Juan, I'd like your thoughts on this proposition.

I don't know Alex, but I do know this: I have an expectation (recently
dashed to smithereens) that a project such as Tor Inc, promoting
"freedom of speech, whistleblowing and more", should facilitate at least
ONE public communication forum (email list) which list has a strong
guarantee of freedom of speech, even though most or all other lists may
be considered semi or fully private club lists (only excepting the
laws which bind that corporation in its jurisdiction - a corporation
obviously cannot fail to censor illegal "speech" in its home
It is extremely disappointing to me that Tor Inc fails to even attempt
to do so.
We are left with the reality they are nothing a (semi) private club
operating on dictatorial (sorry, "democratic") principles.

Cecilia, it is amazing to watch the intensity of this campaign - all
ja.talk repostings to the tor-talk list were allowed, but your
responses, which actually came from personal experience, have been used
as grounds to completely ban you from tor-talk.
Uncomfortable echoes of "I told you so, all of you" in the voice of
Juan, inexplicable bounce around my mind :)
So many examples we have (Debian, Tor, your electronics groups and
plenty more) where people join an online discussion group of some sort,
invest life energy, and for a while feel they are "part of a community",
only to have that feeling destroyed at some point when the moderator,
administrator or employees pull rank and expose themselves, and expose
the presumptions we made about them and -their- forums as matching what
we originally thought it was.
When there is public opposition to a particular exercise of dictatorial
authority, then that is a data point suggesting a new, similar group
(public or private club) could be created, with different or similar
rules etc.
When there is alignment between those who exercise authority over a
forum, perhaps on behalf of the majority of that forum or not, and the
expectations of the majority in that forum, then there will presumably
be relative harmony.
And those who experience being in the minority learn that they need to
look elsewhere for others who share their particular bent.
The journey can be painful, eye opening, liberating or all of these.

Im saying "ok, so we agree folks have the right to create private clubs

expectation that Tor Inc actually live a bit of what it preaches and
provide at least one "free speech, go for it guys and gals" list?

kill filed her.
Would you agree that users who are about to be banned, ought be given,
say, AT LEAST ONE CHANCE to comply with a request to "stop posting off
topic, if you continue we will ban you"?
To my mind, that would be a sane foundation for the development of

where he lands off the ski jump without crashing for the first time (or
at least, without dieing :) and his trainer (who got banned from the
sport so many years prior for being arrogant 'but transparent') yells
out "You did it! And we're a disgrace!!"
So: You did it! You stood for honesty, spoke personally and

I did a double take on that too - I thought first "may be this is HTML
email not translating bold into text format properly or something".
I ended up reading it as follows:
   > > Best of luck
   > ASSCRACK. He's WAY too polite.
As in, Rayzer saying Boyce is an ASSCRACK, and not approving.
Then of course the "He's WAY too polite" comment could come across as
"if he were not so polite, he might not be seen as an ASSCRACK, and
would be doing his job properly, as it is, he fucked up."
But then my default "assume best intention" hat compels me to then
assume that Rayzer is a little socially inept, probably as a result of
vaccination damage causing a mild autism or something.
But then, he has demonstrated more than adequate capacity for being not
inept, and in fact quite intellectually incisive (if moronic in his
views - doublethink indeed).
It does seem to me has has failed to contemplate in depth on his
schooling/ indoctrination - at the very least.i

Taking out of context an "expressed suspicion" as a fact of name calling,
won't do you any favours.
"We gave you enough rope to hang yourself, and those who went slightly
overboard by my personal definition (at least until next week or
whenever I change the rules again) are now banned, without even a single
individual warning/ request to keep on topic, being given to said
Classy. List administration at its best there Boyce. Not.
"Arbitrary justice", which you might like to inform yourself regarding,
is where "the rules" are not known in advance, and no concession is made
to those who break the rules, WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW THOSE RULES.
Your choice to allow "three weeks of unbridled posting" created in many
of our minds, a rule which we all thought we were following - ja.talk
kept reposting media crap, we had a right to respond (or so we thought).
Your executive choice to ban certain individuals who "broke" your rule
(because they went three weeks and ONE EXTRA DAY (let's say)), when you
NEVER STATED to us your rule about "three weeks is OK, but three weeks
+ one day and THEN you will be banned with no right to recourse nor even
any right to request me personally to change my mind" is EXTREMELY
You have told us by your actions as well as your words (besides a few
other things about yourself) that you WILL exercise arbitrary power
over real humans attempting to communicate their truth, their soul,
their pain, their attempts to find resultion on at least one of the
normally -most- challenging and difficult conversations we Westerners
have to confront, rape.
Aren't you a bloody hero now?!!
Three claps for Boyce, dispensing justice and facilitating community.
Clap, clap, clap.
"And those who broke my rule in the past, are now kill filed by me, and
even if you genuinely want to join and participate and abide by my
rules, well who gives a flying f*** about you, this is MY list, and I AM
the administrator, and I SET THE RULES!"
Three cheers for Boyce, bringing real empathy and humanity to the Tor
project, making the world a better place, cleaning up unsavoury posters.
"Boyce, doing the Right Thing (cause he said so)."
Of course. As I too have said.
And we are now clear on your choice to exercise your predatorial right
to arbitrary exercise of power. Fascism in action.
How very American (hat tip to Juan)...

Tor HQ cannot come back from this with the current crowd.
" is devastating.
To quote one of the participants at line 227
"22:14 < Yawning> I don't think I can sit in this conversation and
remain civil."
I can only concur.
Americans in power - the insidious arrogance and pride leading to
blindness, heartless comparisons between e.g. Iraq war and Mahondas
Ghandi, thuggery (implied threat to sue/ take legal action, bullying,
distraction/ changing topic, isis "my keyboard does not work" in the
middle of this really intense conversation.
Just say no more!
Anyway, the conversation indicts. Has to be read. grarpamp, thank you
Both Juan and Putin claim (vehemently) that Tor is a creation and a tool
of the NSA, the CIA and the American war machine, and that it cannot be
trusted as a consequence of these facts.
After reading this conversation, it is impossible to disagree with both
Juan and Putin on this point.
So I guess this makes both Putin and Juan, "conspiracy factualists",
because there certainly ain't no 'theory' to be tested any more...
It is not surprising that Russia is wanting to "button the digital
hatches" so to speak, given the horrific demoncratic record of the CIA
since WWII - the major and very sad problem is that such legislation
almost never gets unwound once the battle is over. So there's always
another battle..
At line 268: "< mikeperry> also, I am completely unsure what to do about
the DaveC1 thing. it seems like it will put a lot of our community at
risk and cause fallout. I was excited to have a bridge to the State dept
and gov't bureaucrats, but this seems like the cost is too great.
forgive me if I appear to otherwise ignore this, really not sure how to
handle it"
Thought: If the CIA, which funds Tor via the DoD etc, really wanted an
advocacy position, then there was no reason to not just keep "DaveC1" on
payroll at the CIA and promote Tor. So DaveC1's attempt to get on Tor
payroll directly, and be close to the core of Tor, falls apart on
multiple grounds as well as this.
Here's a classic at 227 "22:25 < ioerror> We [Tor] don't hire war
criminals, we don't [can't be accused of] discriminate by not hiring
them" (in response to the supposedly "ex-" CIA man, DaveC1, who implied
the threat he would sue Tor Inc if they refused to employ him "just
because he used to work for the CIA and shot citizens of Iraq" (or
rather, terminated his employment it seems, now that they figured out he
lied to get employed, saying he was from US State Dept).
22:30 < mikeperry> I have no doubt that the CIA would find Tor useful,
and its funding would not comrpromise us, but as I said then, the optics
[of directly employing a (ex) CIA agent]
would be so bad that the et improvement to Tor from such funding would
not be worth the bad PR
22:31 < ioerror> mikeperry: Funding does compromise us
22:31 < ioerror> I am clear on that now.
22:31 < ioerror> Tor is compromised.
22:32 < ioerror> When we set the road map and found funders to fund us,
it was different
22:32 < ioerror> we haven't done that for a long time
22:32 < ioerror> The money has corrupted us
Here's a satisfying line 332:
"22:35 < DaveC1> Runa: re: the not waiting until I could disclose.
Didn't have the financial resources to end one career and wait
(unsure how long) to start looking for other work. I tried
to be as clear as possible with Roger what my situation was
without committing a felony. I obviously failed.
Yep, seems CIA agents find it real hard to -not- commit felonies,
even when they are -trying- to not commit felonies.
Really, the entire log is a must read.

conventional thinking or the status quo, and instead of supporting
the questioner, you tried to defend the indefensible until it was
obvious the indefensible could no longer be defended?
Is it possible that for you, the ends ("I/we are trying to save the
world") justifies the means ("an evil is done now, under my watch")?
Is it really too radical to suggest that instead of justifying an
evil, it might be better to just say no?
To support the staunch and principled man or woman in uncomfortable
To identify and support humility and humanity, to display a little
So you say you need the wood for what you're building, but how does
heartlessness make a better world?
Does justifying an evil now, in pursuance of a purportedly better
world, make you just a little bit sociopathic?

b) with whom you jump onto the same list
You don't get to choose both. That would be a fascist dictatorship by

@_author: Zenaan Harkness 
@_subject: Litvinenko - Russian demonisation continues to crumble 
OK, a few facts first, to try to pre-empt some standard responses (to
whoever ends up reading this):
I am pro-Russian, from points of view including the following:
   - That which I perceive as a "higher human intention" permeating the
     Russian psyche, Russian history and the "Russian ethos".
   - Putin is unimpeachable. He has never taken any bribe, is patriotic
     for his nation, loves his people, speaks truth, and encourages
     Russians, and the entire world, to stand for a better world -
     seriously, can we ask for a better leader? in ANY country?
   - Russians (in general) do not say "I, human, am the greatest and
     highest thing in existence" - such arrogance is not the Russian
     way.
     Russians allow for things or consciousnesses or beings of greater
     capacity, things yet unknown to the mind of man, for higher
     possibilties for "man" and "soul";
     as true scientists, Russian souls are open to higher possibilties,
     potential and actual realities, holding as true that we are more
     than reproducing worms.
     No matter -how- great any "scientific achievement," humility in the
     face of the extraordinary-ness of this existence is maintained.
   - As at right now, the multi-polar world vision is the only hope we
     have for a reasonable power balance in this world.
     Anarchists or those desiring direct democracy, the "true"
     socialists and "true" communists, and even the communalist Rojavans
     - none have the mind share to cause a significant stand against
     America the hegemon!
     Perhaps in the future, we can attempt to move towards something
     even better than a multi polar nationalistic world, who knows - I
     certainly hope for greater possibilities, but right now, America is
     absolutely despotic in its actions, and its collective despotic
     hegemonic intention, MUST be stopped.
The hegemon must be stopped.
The world is in the middle of a major war at the moment, and most
sheeple don't see this war for the future 'world order' - they see
"localised" military wars only - Libya, Iraq, Syria, etc. But the real
war is a war of wills, the war of empire - the American hegemonic
intention vs the "global south" (as Pepe Escobar calls it) and this
"global south"'s multi-polar intention.
I say this multi-polar possibility, in the framework of nations, MICs
and governments (which predominate the world today), is the only current
hope for a balance of powers in this world, for the possibility of one
or a group of countries opposing a demonic / evil intention of another
very powerful country (right now, it is America and its endless
domination of the rest of the planet, in the future, it may be some
other wanna-be hegemon).
Saddam Hussein had the gall to think he could throw off his CIA
overlords (who put him in power in the first place) and start selling
oil for Euros, ditching the US dollar. Are you kidding me?
Muammar Gaddhafi was slowly building a physical gold base reached over
120 tonnes (small by some national standards, very large by Canadian
standards) and he consistently promoted an arabic world "gold dinar"
currency. And what happened when he started to try to sell oil for
currencies other than US dollars?
That's right, America, France and the UK piled in to bust up his party.
The hegemon must be stopped.
Putin is the only true statesman on the world stage today. Now I'm sure
some will disagree with this, but if you wish to suggest the contrary to
me, please bring with you AT LEAST ONE FACT. There are first hand
reports where Americans studying him for many years from within Russia
have stated "yeah, we haven't been able to find a single instance of
Putin accepting a bribe" for just one of many examples.
And if you can find an actual fact that shows an evil deed done by
Putin, an example of corruption by his own hands, I will be very
surprised, and will question and research your source - so be prepared to
be absolutely certain about your purported fact.
The only fact I have that goes anywhere near this is the current Russian
legislation making its way towards law which shall require backdoors in
all encryption software sold (perhaps used?) in Russia - I hope it's not
signed into law, but if it is, it is hard to deny Russia parity with the
"glorious" West, in the face of the endless attempts to overthrow
nations both near to Russia, and in other continents, and Russia itself!
American government's intention to split Russia up the guts is
documented by America itself. Poor Soros, he is currently failing with
this particular intention, and we ought be very very grateful this is
As many of us have now read many times, by American mouths,
"Ukraine's recent Maidan was the most blatant coup in history", and
America, mostly via the CIA, has been attacking nation after nation,
democratically elected leader after democratically elected leader in
foreign nations around the world, since WWII. America is the epitome of
a hegemonic empire nation running amok - and sadly, no one even
attempts to dispute this very sad fact...
With the quantity, quality and intensity of mud slinging propaganda
against USSR (since WWII), against Russia since the USSR's collapse, and
against Putin in his time, it is so very easy for us Western schooled
humans to accept that "some of the mud just MUST be true", e.g. "oh
well, this particular Western lie has been exposed, but you know, Putin
is still really bad, and Russia is just murderers and drunkards, like all
the way down like".
No there might not be any truth to the "bad Russians, bad Putin" meme!
Perhaps they're fellow humans?
Perhaps they're in fact really fine humans, and real humans?
Perhaps their current leader is pretty damn great, by any and all
international, national and local, Christian, and any other, standards?
Perhaps the current collective Russian vision of a multi polar world is
in fact the best thing for all of us on this planet, given the current
despotic intentions of America and the deep hegemon (UK, France, etc -
the Western oligarchic elite power brokers)?
We can call this "Russians simply MUST be bad" meme, "the Western
apologist". I.e. the Western apologist is he or she who cannot break the
mold of the Western MSM propaganda, and so has convinced himself that
"although I have not seen an actual fact to say so, it must be true that
Putin is somehow bad, since, you know, he's in government and no one in
government can be trusted anyway, and he's, he's, he's Russian! so he
MUST be bad!"
Read Putin's Crimea speech!
Read Putin's recent anniversary address to the United Nations!
In fact, READ ANY SPEECH OF THE current president of russia,

is not my opinion, not the MSM opinion, but is your own, personal,
opinion. Please.

I see it a bit different than that. For me, part of the Russian way is
humility for example, which I see lacking in a lot of Australian
politicians for example.
I am Australian, but I actually see "being Russian" as something to
strive for - kind of like "being someone who works towards one best self
perceived potential for oneself". Sorry, I don't really have the words
for it... but for me a "true Russian" is someone who seeks a higher
potential, for themselves, their neighbours, the whole world.
This is quite different to the plain "someone who lives within the
borders of the country currently called Russia".
And Russians today have the "benefit" if we can call it that, of having
collectively gone through hell and back, in the current last few
generations (WWII and the collapse of the USSR - very hard times).
Perhaps for some geographic Russians, there is a prideful nationalism,
but I think it is not so much - USSR was the world's second only
superpower, then bam, USSR is no more, there's a breakup into a dozen
countries, and suddenly "geographic Russians" are now separated all over
eastern Europe, in so many different countries, families now need visas
and travel permission to visit each other. And this isn't isolated
experience, this is experience for many many millions of people!
Russians genuinely looked up to the West. We were presented as the moral
high ground, the ethically superior system - and, thankfully, many/ most
Russians now see this "political" bullshit for what it was.
Anyone can be Russian. Even anarchists :)

References: Finally! For those who pine for the cozy safety of a modern democratic
socialist nation, yes Australia is here for you. Razer (I think), your
concerns about cycling safety have been answered in abundance, and are
being enforced :D
As folks round here already know, the government's right to legislate
is absolute. At least now we'll bring appropriate pressure on all
those irresponsible parents who fail to clip a helmet to their poor
defenseless child as they hurtle off round the neighbourhood. Please,
who will think of the children? The Australian government, that's who.
And for those who have yet to experience the smallest of peaceful
civil dissent or disobedience or peaceful political protest, and it's
consequences, your protest will almost always be couched by the
government solicitors as something like "The zero tolerance cycling
safety laws are valid. They serve a legitimate object of government
power, that is, the safety of its citizens."
And so they strive, almost always successfully, to couch your case,
not in terms of the rights you believe are unalienable, but in terms
of the validity of their pathetic whining little bastard children of
legislation making, the god almighty Statute Laws though shalt obey
and praise the state!
This "validity of the law" position that the govt takes is entirely
deceptive: unless you really go into the depths of the invalidity of
the government itself, the Australian states have given themselves
catch-all power of "the power to pass any law for the good governance
of the people."
A loud and bombastic, indeed theatrical "OBJECTION!" is advised in
such moments as the validity of the law is being raised and or pounded
into your posterior...
However! Hark, there is hope! The common law right has almost never
been removed, and must be explicitly removed by an act for that common
law right to be taken to be removed - the mere affirmation of a
legislative power (e.g. for a concern of safety), in the guise of an
almighty statute, does -not- by itself remove that common law right.
Yes you heard me right. At least in Australia although the citation is
forgotten just at the moment, this is the position of the High Court
of Australia (HCA), comparable to SCOTUS.
It's an intellectual deception the govt invariably runs against you
and your dirty, dirty human rights, but you need to master this
particular deception if you wish to prevail in the Australian courts
on a common law civil liberties/ common law right legal ground. Oh,
and you might also have to be willing to shoot up to the High Court on
appeal. Which, unless you are bold enough to stand in front of the
bench and speak your right by yourself, that is without a lawyer,
barrister, solicitor or queens counsel (if you have a spare $80K lying
around...), might be costly and/ or intimidating. And for those who
-do- have the $80k just lying around,
TAKE NOTICE: most legal representatives in -this- country will phrase
-your- defence of the government's charge(s) against you (in your
peaceful political protest), in terms of the validity of the law,
thereby selling you out before you even get near enough to the HCA to
realise you've been sold out because yes, "your" lawyer/barrister/etc
asked the wrong damn question from the start, applying at each level
of appeal, all the way to High Court where you case is resoundingly
dismissed since "We find that this particular law is valid..." At that
point it's too late to say wtf!

NSW's finest dropkick politicians have lost the plot again by imposing
ridiculous fines against cyclists for victimless "offences." If
stupidity was a criminal offence most Aussie politicians should be
doing life in prison for multiple offences.
New cycling laws: One of the first bike riders hit with $319 fine for
not wearing a helmet
Jim O’Rourke and Miles Godfrey, The Daily Telegraph
March 2, 2016
Cyclist Ben Ackerley was fined for not wearing a helmet while riding
his bike on the first day new cycling laws came into effect. Picture:

New cycling laws come into play
Opinion: ‘New bike laws are a joke’
DESPITE the threat of the massive new fines for running red lights,
not wearing helmets and riding dangerously, The Daily Telegraph
witnessed cyclists continuing to flout the road rules.
Ben Ackerley, who recently moved to Sydney from the United States,
became possibly the first rider to be booked under the new fine
The restaurant manager from Darlinghurst was riding on Oxford St just
before midday and was not wearing a helmet.

while riding his bike. Picture: Ross SchultzSource:News Corp Australia
A police Highway Patrol officer on a motorcycle pulled Mr Ackerley
over and hit him with the new $319 fine – up from just $71.
“I’d just picked the bike up from the bike shop after getting it
fixed,” he said.
“It got wrecked in an accident with a taxi on Market St about three
weeks ago. I knew about the no helmet laws but I was just riding about
a mile and a half (1.6km) home.
“I’ve just come from living in New York City. The cops there have got
better things to do than worry about this sort of stuff.”
Mr Ackerley said he may appeal for leniency.
As part changes to cycling laws beginning Tuesday, fines for five
offences have increased by up to 500 per cent.

leniency. Source: News Corp Australia
As well as new fines for no wearing helmets, cyclists risk $425 fines
for running a red light; riding dangerously and; not stopping at
pedestrian crossings.
Motorists who do not leave a 1m buffer between their vehicle and a
bike when travelling up to 60km/h can be hit with a $319 fine and lose
two demerit points.
Those travelling more than 60km/h must leave a 1.5m space.
During today’s morning peak, The Daily Telegraph saw riders shooting
through on the red light at busy intersections along Oxford St,
between Taylor Square at Darlinghurst and College St in the CBD.
While the vast majority of cyclists kept to the left lane, some riders
weaved among the traffic, coming less than a metre from vehicles
moving slowly through the rush hour traffic.
At the intersections with Flinders, Crown and Riley streets, a number
of cyclists pushed to the front of the traffic queues stopped at red
lights, leading to some distance issues between cars and bikes when
the lights turned green.
In Randwick, a number of cyclists were spotted riding in the middle
lane of the three city-bound lanes, on Alison Rd.

Several weaved among the traffic even though a shared cycle/pedestrian
path runs along the northern side of the road.
On King St at Newtown, a rider, without a helmet, insisted on riding
on the footpath.
Along busy Bondi Rd at Bondi, several riders darted between vehicles
slowing moving towards the city.
Police could not confirm any other incidents of vehicle drivers being
fined for not giving enough space to cyclists.
On Monday, Traffic and Highway Patrol Commander John Hartley said his
officers would use their discretion, but would book those who were
obviously breaking the new laws.
A spokesman for the police Highway Patrol said it had not scheduled a
specific enforcement operation targeting cyclists to coincide with the
first morning of the new laws.
“Police, including our Motorcycle Response Teams, were undertaking
their regular duties this morning,” the spokesman said.
The government’s Transport Management Centre said it had not recorded
any incidents involving cyclists during the morning peak.
Bicycle NSW CEO Ray Rice said the majority of cyclists are keen to do
the right thing and obey all road rules.
While he strongly supports the new minimum passing distance rule,
because it offers extra protection to riders, the cycling community is
opposed to the increased fines and mandatory photo ID for bicycle
In the lead up to the law changes, Bicycle NSW handed a petition
containing 10,000 signatures to the state government demanding the
government immediately rescind the fine increases and photo ID
sections of the legislation.
Mr Rice said last month that regulation should be a last resort and
described NSW as fast becoming Australia’s nanny state.
Mr Rice said no other state has fines this high - and no other state
will be introducing mandatory photo identification for bicycle riders.
“These two measures do nothing to help the government achieve their
aim of doubling the number of riders using bikes for transport,” he
Mr Rice urged the government to mount a stronger and more sustained
public education campaign to inform all road users of how the distance
laws work.
“We are just not getting the cut through required,” Mr Rice said.
“But we know police are not going to be out there with a tape measure
trying to work out the distance between cars and bikes.”
The NRMA today said it supports the increase in fines.
“We support the argument that cyclists should have to carry ID because
what we know is that the overwhelming majority of cyclists do the
right thing and this is targeting the ones who don’t,” spokesman Peter
Khoury said.
“They are putting their lives at risk and we don’t want that.”
City of Sydney Liberal councillor Christine Forster said cyclists are
road users so should be expected to obey the rules.
“That should, I imagine, foster mutual respect among cyclists and
drivers,” Ms Forster said.

A new and compelling perspective for me...
 At long last, listen to the women!

State entrapment, extortion, imprisonment and slander sharpen the
consciousness of sex workers who denounce anti-prostitution,
anti-pimping and anti-trafficking policies invariably used to repress
women and undermine feminist liberation struggles.

Gail Pheterson began organising with the sex workers of COYOTE in San
Francisco in 1984 during a sabbatical year at the Institute for the
Study of Social Change, University of California, Berkeley. While in
San Francisco she designed an alliance project of whores, wives and
dykes that transformed into a network of Bad Girl Rap Groups.
Co-facilitated with Margo St. James, Scarlot Harlot/Carol Leigh,
Priscilla Alexander, Sharon Kaiser, E. Kitch Childs, Gloria Locket and
others, the Bad Girl Rap Groups were open to "any woman who had ever
been stigmatised as bad by her work, colour, class, sexuality, history
of abuse, or just plain gender".
Upon her return to Europe, she co-founded the Red Thread and Pink
Thread, two interwoven Dutch organisations of sex workers and allies,
with Margot Alvarez, Ans van der Drift, Martine Groen, Violet and
others. She also co-organised with Margo St. James the First World
Whores’ Congress in Amsterdam and the Second World Whores’ Congress at
the European Parliament in Brussels, and co-founded the International
Committee for Prostitutes' Rights.
Gail Pheterson edited the transcripts of the Whores' Congresses for
publication in A Vindication of the Rights of Whores (released in
Spanish under the title Nosotras Las Putas) and published a series of
essays titled The Prostitution Prism (also in Spanish and French),
including her most known and widely translated essay, ‘The Whore
Stigma: Female Dishonor and Male Unworthiness’.

defiant resistance against oppression. Those feminists knew their
struggle was dangerous but they were unrelenting in claiming rights

limelight over the past decades, but women's liberation is still a far
cry from home. Government authorities, world organisations, and social
reformers continue to undermine radical analysis of pervasive sexism
with emotionally-charged rhetoric of individual female misfortune and
male misconduct. Exposés of criminal and perverse men capturing
helpless women ignite public outrage while leaving intact
institutional obstacles to women’s mobility, work, and bodily
self-determination. This rhetoric sabotages liberation strategies by
taking women-on-the-run into protective custody of the status quo.
Anti-violence discourse then serves to reinforce state repression of
women. Knowingly or unknowingly, the establishment has succeeded in
wrenching the feminist agenda from its subversive fibre. The result is
effective camouflage of the political cause for women's flight and
disregard for women's material needs, social choices and, most
insidiously, agency in thinking and shaping their destinies.
All women have reason to seek liberty, but all do not face the same
life conditions. The contemporary foot soldiers of our movement are
rightless migrant women disallowed from leaving home, crossing
borders, earning money, or living independently. Without rights, they
are forced to bargain their survival with abusive profiteers inside
and outside the law. In legislation, popular media, police records, UN
conventions, and even ill-founded feminist tracts, they are branded
trafficked women, trapped in the nexus of global power relations, and
categorised as this or that kind of victim or tramp.
Savvy feminists
Sex worker activists are savvy feminist analysts of these
machinations, their consciousness undoubtedly sharpened by daily
trials of (escaping) state entrapment, extortion, imprisonment, and
slander. As intimates of both backroom and front stage men,
prostitutes are solicited by government officials to serve as
undercover agents and informants. Their advantage over socially
reputable women is their exclusion from polite society and direct
experience of institutional vice. Mainstream feminists would do well
to listen to their word in public as male authorities do in private.
Their first demand is decriminalisation of sex work. This implies
repealing prohibitions against negotiations and services attached to
the sex industry, including the hiring of third parties to facilitate
management of businesses and travel to foreign markets. In other
words, sex workers demand the abolition of anti-prostitution,
anti-pimping and anti-trafficking laws. They know that such laws
invariably translate into discriminatory surveillance, fines, arrest,
detention, and expulsion of migrant women.
Since popular opinion equates pimping and trafficking with the vile
use and abuse of women, well-intentioned reformers persist in
promoting restrictive legislation that curtails women's sexual
negotiations and geographic displacements. Most existing criminal laws
against pimping and trafficking are about sex, money, and travel – not
about violence. Some countries do require evidence of force to proceed
with prosecution, but women are nonetheless subject to discriminatory
surveillance rationalised as preventive measures ‘for their own good’.
Violence, coercion, and deceit do, of course, occur in prostitution,
as elsewhere in the sex class system. Certainly sex workers should
have the same recourse to laws against those crimes as any legitimate
plaintiff would have in cases of battery, rape, fraud, kidnapping, or
other offense against their person. But equal juridical treatment is
incompatible with prejudicial classification as prostitute or
trafficked woman. Sex workers demand generic, gender-neutral
consideration undifferentiated from other workers, citizens, or human
beings. Crimes against women are not crimes against incapacitated
dependents, property, or morality; they are crimes against
Criminalise marriage?
Women have ample cause for class action to claim compensation for a
host of injustices, whether unpaid labour, insult, assault, or
discrimination. Reparation could be a feminist collective demand.
Matrimony and maternity are clearly the key historical sites of
subjugation for women in terms of toil and sacrifice. But feminists
have never called for prohibition of marriage or pregnancy, regardless
of the risks and documented damages. Feminists have fought to give
women alternatives or escapes from heterosexual coercions with divorce
rights, battered women shelters and lesbians legitimacy. And they have
fought to give women escapes from forced pregnancy or forced
sterilisation by demanding reproductive choice and by facilitating
access to contraception and abortion. But surely they would not deny
women the right to decide for themselves whether to marry or bear a
child or even whether to remain with an abusive husband.  And they
would not deny the rewards and satisfactions some women experience as
wives or mothers. Why do sex workers not receive the same respect?
There could also be a feminist class action to claim compensation for
injustices in the sex industry. And clearly, alternatives and escape
channels depend upon feminist struggles for migrant rights, labour
rights, and residency permits for independent women. But there is no
justification for denying the right to negotiate payment for sexual
services. Individually we are each in the grip of specific realities,
each a unique person, and each entitled to our own thought processes
and life choices. Collectively we can shape visions and common
liberatory goals without judging any individual woman for her
meanderings in the sex class system.

References: There's a lot of history between the Kurds and the Russians - over two

After reading this article, I am not so hopeful about "Rojava",
although I do still think it would be an excellent experiment, if the
power players (Russia, USA) can agree to it, to experiment with a mini
state with a political anarchist foundation. If an 'independent'
Kurdistan is carved up out of the mid east, perhaps "Rojava the
political anarchist micro state" will yet be allowed to exist within
that mini state. As a social species, we owe it to ourselves to at
least see what might come out of such an experiment...

as the article suggests, this may also be payment for past support.
Turks Aren't Going to Like This: US Building Two Airstrips in Syrian Kurdistan
Which can mean only one thing: more US hardware for the Kurdish militias
 Joshua Grimes
According to Kurdish reports US is building two airstrips in
north-eastern Syria under the control of the Kurdish YPG militia.
Asked for a comment Americans neither denied nor confirmed the reports
saying they were not "in control" of any airfields in Syria but were
"consistently looking for ways to increase efficiency for logistics".
– Obviously it's possible to have airstrips built or expanded (or ask
to have them expanded) to enhance their 'efficiency for logistics'
without taking formal control of them.
The airstrips are clearly not intended to serve as US airbases (as
Kurds also claim), but that's going to do little to comfort Ankara. US
is already delivering supplies to the Kurdish YPG, particularly in the
Syrian north-east. If airstrips are being expanded that can only mean
that such deliveries are to be increased – possibly to be delivered by
larger aircraft.
Indeed, in recent days the Kurds have been making progress against
ISIS, and have been doing so in the southern direction towards Raqqa
and along the Syrian-Iraqi border favored by the US. (Rather than in
the Kurdish-favored western direction that would see them link up with
the Kurdish Afrin corridor and seal off Syria's northern border from
Turkey completely.)
Are Kurds getting their reward for playing along?

Well well well - what a tangled and hellish web the West weaves (see
below)... the sad and indicting facts of reality are steadily going
public. "Conspiracy nuts" have no joy in this. The evil is beyond a
London Has Fallen or "Benghazi" propaganda movie. City of London and
Wall Street 'had to take down Qaddafi' to stop his pan-African/Arabic
gold backed currency "initiative", so unfortunately lost him his life.
The odd speech I've watched, Qaddafi was compelling, and with heart
for his people and those beyond his nations boundaries. Now we can see
why the West acted and continues to act so brutishly.
French oligarchs - your number's called!
City of London and Wall Street bankers - you can't hide your deeds!
Western oligarchs - you stand with despotic authority.
How small minded are the West's oligarchs? So narrow minded, so
belligerently addicted to control of currencies and nations, as though
there's not enough abundance to go round... major cases of small dick
syndrome are evidently in abundance all around the West's 'halls of
power' - how absolutely fucking pathetic! (Evidently Hillary and
Merkel are thoroughly bound - so this is nothing that men have any
monopoly on.)
I'm guessing that at least in hindsight it might be seen to have been
in Qaddafi's interest to work with Russia on that particular gold
backed currency initiative. Still surprised he not took the lesson
from Saddam's "oil for Euros" hanging. Perhaps Russia was seen as
weak, or rather if we be frank "devastated" as it was when the USSR
was destroyed, only now beginning to get back her stride.
The sanctions against Russia and the CIA sponsored "colored springs"
(turmoil) around Russia in the last few years take on a more poignant
appearance in the face of Hillary's emails - attempts to keep the bear
occupied, hey hey, Wall Street's version of "Occupy Russia" - I only
wish it were a laughing matter.
Is difficult for me to comprehend the acceptance of Hillary Clinton by
at least some faction of American's in the face of her ghastly "we
came, we saw, he died" laughter - the acceptance of such insanity is a
sign, and more than "the 'leaders' have lost touch with the people"
but really that (the American) people have lost touch with the
despotic evil reality of their 'leaders'.
We have a duty to stand against such evil.
Small mercies that we get these little leaks of information here and there...
Hillary Emails, Gold Dinars and Arab Springs
Column: Society
Region: Middle East
Country: Libya
Buried amid tens of thousands of pages of former US Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton’s secret emails, now being made public by the US
Government, is a devastating email exchange between Clinton and her
confidential adviser, Sid Blumenthal. It’s about Qaddafi and the
US-coordinated intervention in 2011 to topple the Libyan ruler. It’s
about gold and a potentially existential threat to the future of the
US dollar as world reserve currency. It’s about Qaddafi’s plans then
for the gold-based Dinar for Africa and the Arab oil world.
Two paragraphs in a recently declassified email from the illegal
private server used by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during
the US-orchestrated war to destroy Libya’s Qaddafi in 2011 reveal a
tightly-held secret agenda behind the Obama Administration’s war
against Qaddafi, cynically named “Responsibility to Protect.”
Barack Obama, an indecisive and weak President, delegated all
presidential responsibility for the Libya war to his Secretary of
State, Hillary Clinton. Clinton, who was an early backer of an Arab
“regime change,” using the secret Muslim Brotherhood, invoked the new,
bizarre principle of “responsibility to protect” (R2P) to justify the
Libyan war, which she quickly turned into a NATO-led war. Under R2P, a
silly notion promoted by the networks of George Soros’ Open Society
Foundations, Clinton claimed, with no verifiable proof, that Qaddafi
was bombing innocent Libyan civilians in the Benghazi region (
 ).
According to a New York Times report at the time, citing Obama
Administration senior sources, it was Hillary Clinton, backed by
Samantha Power, then a senior aide at the National Security Council
and today Obama’s UN Ambassador; and Susan Rice, then Obama’s
ambassador to the United Nations, and now National Security Adviser.
That triad pushed Obama into military action against Libya’s Qaddafi.
Clinton, flanked by Powers and Rice, was so powerful that Clinton
managed to overrule Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Tom Donilon,
Obama’s national security adviser, and John Brennan, Obama’s
counterterrorism chief, today CIA head (
Secretary of State Clinton was also knee-deep in the conspiracy to
unleash what came to be dubbed the “Arab Spring,” the wave of
US-financed regime changes across the Arab Middle East (
), part of the Greater Middle East project unveiled in 2003 by the
Bush Administration after occupation of Iraq. The first three target
countries of that 2011 US “Arab Spring”–an action in which Washington
used its “human rights” NGOs such as Freedom House and National
Endowment for Democracy, in cahoots as usual, with the Open Society
Foundations of billionaire speculator, George Soros, along with US
State Department and CIA operatives–were Ben Ali’s Tunisia, Mubarak’s
Egypt and Qaddafi’s Libya.
Now the timing and targeting of Washington’s 2011 “Arab Spring”
destabilizations of select Middle East states assume a new light in
relation to just-released declassified Clinton emails to her private
Libya “adviser” and friend, Sid Blumenthal. Blumenthal is the slick
lawyer who defended then-President Bill Clinton in the Monika Lewinsky
and other sex scandal affairs when Bill was President and facing
Qaddafi’s gold dinar
For many it remains a mystery just why Washington decided that Qaddafi
personally must be destroyed, murdered, not just sent into exile like
Mubarak. Clinton, when informed of Qaddafi’s brutal murder by
US-financed Al Qaeda “democratic opposition” terrorists, told CBS
news, in a sick, joking paraphrase of Julius Caesar, “We came, we saw,
he died,” words spoken by her with a hearty, macabre laugh (
Little is known in the West about what Muammar Qaddafi did in Libya
or, for that matter, in Africa and in the Arab world. Now, release of
a new portion of Hillary Clinton’s emails as Secretary of State, at
the time she was running Obama Administration war on Qaddafi, sheds
dramatic new light on the background.
It was not a personal decision of Hillary Clinton to eliminate Qaddafi
and destroy his entire state infrastructure. The decision, it’s now
clear, came from circles very high in the US money oligarchy. She was
merely another Washington political tool implementing the mandate of
those oligarchs. The intervention was about killing Qaddafi’s
well-laid plans to create a gold-based African and Arabic currency to
replace the dollar in oil trades. Since the US dollar abandoned gold
exchange for dollars in 1971 the dollar in terms of gold has
dramatically lost value. Arab and African OPEC oil states have long
objected to the vanishing purchasing power of their oil sales,
mandated since the 1970’s by Washington to be solely in US dollars, as
dollar inflation soared more than 2000% to 2001.
In a newly declassified Clinton email from Sid Blumenthal to Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton dated April 2, 2011, Blumenthal reveals the
reason that Qaddafi must be eliminated. Using the pretext of citing an
unidentified “high source” Blumenthal writes to Clinton, “According to
sensitive information available to this source, Qaddafi’s government
holds 143 tons of gold, and a similar amount in silver… This gold was
accumulated prior to the current rebellion and was intended to be used
to establish a pan-African currency based on the Libyan golden Dinar.
This plan was designed to provide the Francophone African Countries
with an alternative to the French franc (CFA
).” That French aspect was only the tip of the Qaddafi gold dinar
Golden Dinar and more
During the first decade of this century, Gulf Arab OPEC countries,
including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and others, began seriously diverting a
significant portion of the revenues from their vast oil and gas sales
into state sovereign wealth funds, many based on the success of
Norway’s Oil Fund.
Growing discontent with the US War on Terror, with the wars in Iraq
and in Afghanistan, and with overall US Middle East policies after
September 2001, led most OPEC Arab states to divert a growing share of
oil revenues into state-controlled funds rather than trusting it to
the sticky fingers of New York and London bankers as had been the
custom since the 1970’s when oil prices went through the roof,
creating what Henry Kissinger fondly called the “petro-dollar” to
replace the gold-backed dollar Washington walked away from on August
15, 1971. The present Sunni-Shi’ite war or clash of civilizations is
in fact a result of the US manipulations after 2003 in the region—
“divide and rule.”
By 2008 the prospect of sovereign control by a growing number of
African and Arab oil states of their state oil and gas revenues was
causing serious concern in Wall Street as well as the City of London.
It was huge liquidity, in the trillions, they potentially no longer
The timing of the Arab Spring, in retrospect, increasingly looks tied
to Washington and Wall Street efforts to control not only the huge
Arab Middle East oil flows. It is now clear it was equally aimed at
controlling their money, their trillions of dollars accumulating in
their new sovereign wealth funds.
However, as is now confirmed in the latest Clinton-Blumenthal April 2,
2011 email exchange, there was a qualitatively new threat emerging for
Wall Street and the City of London “gods of money,” from the African
and Arab oil world. Libya’s Qaddafi, Tunisia’s Ben Ali and Mubarak’s
Egypt were about to launch a gold-backed Islamic currency independent
of the US dollar. I was first told of this plan in early 2012, at a
Swiss financial and geopolitical conference, by an Algerian with
extensive knowledge of the project. Documentation was scarce at the
time and the story remained in my mental back-burner. Now a far more
interesting picture emerges that puts the ferocity of Washington’s
Arab Spring and its urgency in the case of Libya into perspective.
‘United States of Africa’
In 2009, Qaddafi, who was at the time the President of the African
Union, had proposed that the economically depressed continent adopt
the “Gold Dinar” (
 ).
In the months prior to the US decision, with British and French
backing, to get a UN Security Council resolution that would give them
the legal fig-leaf for a NATO destruction of the Qaddafi regime,
Muammar Qaddafi had been organizing the creation of a gold-backed
dinar that would be used by African oil states as well as Arab OPEC
countries in their sales of oil on the world market.
Had that happened at the time Wall Street and the City of London were
deep into the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the challenge to the
reserve currency role of the dollar would have been more than serious.
It would be a death knell to American financial hegemony, and to the
Dollar System. Africa is one of the world’s richest continents, with
vast unexplored gold and mineral wealth, had been intentionally kept
for centuries underdeveloped or in wars to prevent their development.
The International Monetary Fund and World Bank for the recent decades
have been the Washington instruments to suppress African real
Gaddafi had called upon African oil producers in the African Union and
in Muslim nations to join an alliance that would make the gold dinar
their primary form of money and foreign exchange. They would sell oil
and other resources to the US and the rest of the world only for gold
dinars. As President of the African Union in 2009, Qaddafi introduced
for discussion to African Union member states Qaddafi’s proposal to
use the Libyan dinar and the silver dirham as the only possible money
for the rest of the world to buy African oil (
Along with the Arab OPEC sovereign wealth funds for their oil, other
African oil nations, specifically Angola and Nigeria, were moving to
create their own national oil wealth funds at the time of the 2011
NATO bombing of Libya (
). Those sovereign national wealth funds, tied to Qaddafi’s concept of
the gold dinar, would make Africa’s long-held dream of independence
from colonial monetary control, whether of the British Pound, the
French Franc, the euro or the US dollar, a reality.
Qaddafi was moving forward, as head of the African Union, at the time
of his assassination, with a plan to unify the sovereign States of
Africa with one gold currency, a United States of Africa. In 2004, a
Pan-African Parliament of 53 nations had laid plans for an African
Economic Community – with a single gold currency by 2023.
African oil-producing nations were planning to abandon the
petro-dollar, and demand gold payment for their oil and gas. The list
included Egypt, Sudan, South Sudan, Equatorial Guinea, Congo,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Tunisia, Gabon, South Africa, Uganda,
Chad, Suriname, Cameroon, Mauritania, Morocco, Zambia, Somalia, Ghana,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Cote d’Ivoire, plus Yemen which
had just made significant new oil discoveries. The four African
member-states of OPEC–Algeria, Angola, Nigeria, a giant oil producer
and the largest natural gas producer in Africa with huge natural gas
reserves, and Libya with the largest reserves–would be in the new gold
dinar system.
Little wonder that French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who was given the
up-front role in the war on Qaddafi by Washington, went so far as to
call Libya a “threat” to the financial security of the world (
Hillary’s ‘rebels’ create a central bank
One of the most bizarre features of Hillary Clinton’s war to destroy
Qaddafi was the fact that the US-backed “rebels” in Benghazi, in the
oil-rich eastern part of Libya, in the midst of battle, well before it
was at all clear if they would topple the Qaddafi regime, declared
they had created a Western-style central bank, “in exile.”
In the very first weeks of the rebellion, the rebel leaders declared
that they had created a central bank to replace Gadhafi’s state-owned
monetary authority. The rebel council, in addition to creating their
own oil company to sell the oil they captured announced: “Designation
of the Central Bank of Benghazi as a monetary authority competent in
monetary policies in Libya and appointment of a Governor to the
Central Bank of Libya, with a temporary headquarters in Benghazi (
Commenting on the odd decision, before the outcome of battle was even
decided, to create a western-style central bank to replace Qaddafi’s
sovereign national bank that was issuing gold-backed dinars, Robert
Wenzel in the Economic Policy Journal, remarked, “I have never before
heard of a central bank being created in just a matter of weeks out of
a popular uprising. This suggests we have a bit more than a rag tag
bunch of rebels running around and that there are some pretty
sophisticated influences (
It becomes clear now in light of the Clinton-Blumenthal emails that
those “pretty sophisticated influences” were tied to Wall Street and
the City of London. The person brought in by Washington to lead the
rebels in March 2011, Khalifa Hifter, had spent the previous twenty
years of his life in suburban Virginia, not far from CIA headquarters,
after a break with Libya as a leading military commander of Qaddafi (
The risk to the future of the US dollar as world reserve currency, if
Qaddafi had been allowed to proceed–together with Egypt, Tunisia and
other Arab OPEC and African Union members– to introduce oil sales for
gold not dollars, would clearly have been the financial equivalent of
a Tsunami.
New Gold Silk Road
The Qaddafi dream of an Arabic and African gold system independent of
the dollar, unfortunately, died with him. Libya, after Hillary
Clinton’s cynical “responsibility to protect” destruction of the
country, today is a shambles, torn by tribal warfare, economic chaos,
al-Qaeda and DAESH or ISIS terrorists. The monetary sovereignty held
by Qaddafi’s 100% state-owned national monetary agency and its
issuance of gold dinars is gone, replaced by an “independent” central
bank tied to the dollar.
Despite that setback, it’s more than notable that now an entirely new
grouping of nations is coming together to build a similar gold-backed
monetary system. This is the group led by Russia and China, the
world’s number three and number one gold producing countries,
This group is tied to the construction of China’s One Belt, One Road
New Silk Road Eurasian infrastructure great project. It involves
China’s $16 billion Gold Development Fund, and very firm steps by
China to replace the City of London and New York as the center of
world gold trade. The Eurasian gold system emerging now poses an
entirely new quality of challenge to American financial hegemony. This
Eurasian challenge, its success or failure, could well determine
whether we allow our civilization to survive and prosper under
entirely different conditions, or whether we decide to sink along with
the bankrupt dollar system (

"Our Imperial weapons give definite form to our Empire. And nothing
has shaped our Empire more than the FIAT. The deformation began in
1971, when the US imposed her Power to re-define the rules of the
monetary system for her sole benefit. The ability to print IOU’s in
exchange for real value is more clever than theft as we borrow and do
not pay back in kind due to inflation. Our enemies, adversaries and
vassals must found their financial systems upon the printed dollar
which they must purchase with hard earned money. That seizure has
financed a vast network of military bases, bribery, assassinations,
coup d´états and perpetual war.
What’s not to like? All that Power without taxing the produce of the
American people. So why have we lost in Syria?"
"But whom, may we ask, has the power to decree wealth? And with such
great power to do so, who can be trusted with such great
No one. That is who."
"Inequality of Wealth, therefore, always reaches its peak at the end
of the FIAT timeline."
"That is the death blow. The Fiat produced a parasite – the financial
sector – that in its greed is killing the real economy."
"Monsanto can darken the sunflower harvest in the Ukraine, and Allianz
can steal a few tranquil Greek islands, but the ambience is never
quite the same as when hard working people had their just rewards, and
goodness and charity and kind souls rejoiced – with compassion and
cooperation – while loving the narrative of a life written while
desiring only the product of their work.
The world this Global Reserve Fiat creates is one of misery and strife
where evil and greed feeds upon the spirit, and the world becomes an
immoral wasteland of modernity [I would add: "and war"]. The worker is
discriminated against as all pressure and stress is heaped upon his
future, as the law discriminates between debts held as an asset vs.
debt held as a liability."
"Now, the East – China / Russia / India – challenge the Global Reserve
Fiat. And when the dollar fails, and it will: For debt is the essence
of fiat, and when it defaults, the system defaults with it."
"And when the 98% – their future burdened by intolerable debt,
unemployment and declining wages – decide to walk away? The fear of
that decision has been driving interest rates down for decades, to
make it bearable not for the good of mankind but to prolong the
system. This brings into relief an internal contradiction: wages
decline in sync with interest rates because the bargaining power of
workers evaporates as Central Bankers reduce the cost of capital,
contributing to the substitution of labour and labour wages by that of
the machines and AI software [should just have said "by mechanisation
and automation", but hey, who's quibbling...]."
"As we look at the precarious nature of our faith-based money, we must
acknowledge the moral implications of “dishonest money”. Seizure by
decree, whether judged just by Constituted Power, is immoral. But the
fact that dishonest money is so easy to create, control and
redistribute helps one understand the wave of immorality that has
swept over our world."
["faith based money" - great phrase!]
"Our Imperial weapon will die by both edges of its own sword, one
being the contempt with which it is so easily created to bend the will
of the world to its bidding, and the other sharp edge which the wicked
are blind to recognize: The evil that sound money prohibits."
"The Dynasties of Wealth - Have you ever wondered how we hedge our
holdings through turmoil? The top 85 patricians of which own more
wealth than the bottom 3.5 billion humans – will move first. The 1%,
then 2% and whoever else left standing will be forced to follow
"They easily control men through greed and are beholden to Gold alone.

of attacks we will see from other vendors and in other countries in

The World’s Most Famous Economic Hitman Confesses – They’re Coming for
Your Democracy
Published: March 26, 2016
Source: Michael Krieger
Allen Dulles, the CIA director under presidents Eisenhower and
Kennedy, the younger brother of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles,
and the architect of a secretive national security apparatus that
functioned as essentially an autonomous branch of government. Talbot
offers a portrait of a black-and-white Cold War-era world full of spy
games and nuclear brinkmanship, in which everyone is either a good guy
or a bad guy. Dulles—who deceived American elected leaders and
overthrew foreign ones, who backed ex-Nazis and thwarted left-leaning
democrats—falls firmly in the latter camp.
But what I was really trying to do was a biography on the American
power elite from World War II up to the 60s. That was the key period
when the national security state was constructed in this country, and
where it begins to overshadow American democracy. It’s almost like
Game of Thrones to me, where you have the dynastic struggles between
these power groups within the American system for control of the
country and the world…
Absolutely. The surveillance state that Snowden and others have
exposed is very much a legacy of the Dulles past. I think Dulles would
have been delighted by how technology and other developments have
allowed the American security state to go much further than he went.
He had to build a team of cutthroats and assassins on the ground to go
around eliminating the people he wanted to eliminate, who he felt were
in the way of American interests. He called them communists. We call
them terrorists today. And of course the most controversial part of my
book, I’m sure, will be the end, where I say there was blowback from
that. Because that killing machine in some way was brought back home.
Most readers will be familiar with John Perkins and his best-selling
novel Confessions of an Economic Hitman. What you may not know, is
he’s currently making the rounds warning us that all the corporatist
mercenary tactics employed against third-world nations to financially
benefit U.S. conglomerates are now being turned inward on American
    Twelve years ago, John Perkins published his book, Confessions of
an Economic Hit Man, and it rapidly rose up The New York Times’
best-seller list. In it, Perkins describes his career convincing heads
of state to adopt economic policies that impoverished their countries
and undermined democratic institutions. These policies helped to
enrich tiny, local elite groups while padding the pockets of
U.S.-based transnational corporations.
    If economic pressure and threats didn’t work, Perkins says, the
jackals were called to either overthrow or assassinate the
noncompliant heads of state. That is, indeed, what happened to
Allende, with the backing of the CIA.
    Perkins has just reissued his book with major updates. The basic
premise of the book remains the same, but the update shows how the
economic hit man approach has evolved in the last 12 years. Among
other things, U.S. cities are now on the target list. The combination
of debt, enforced austerity, underinvestment, privatization, and the
undermining of democratically elected governments is now happening
    Sarah van Gelder: What’s changed in our world since you wrote the
first Confessions of an Economic Hit Man?
    John Perkins: Things have just gotten so much worse in the last 12
years since the first Confessions was written. Economic hit men and
jackals have expanded tremendously, including the United States and
    Back in my day we were pretty much limited to what we called the
third world, or economically developing countries, but now it’s
    van Gelder: So how has this switched from us being the
beneficiaries of this hit-man economy, perhaps in the past, to us now
being more of the victims of it?
    Perkins: It’s been interesting because, in the past, the economic
hit man economy was being propagated in order to make America
wealthier and presumably to make people here better off, but as this
whole process has expanded in the U.S. and Europe, what we’ve seen is
a tremendous growth in the very wealthy at the expense of everybody
    On a global basis we now know that 62 individuals have as many
assets as half the world’s population.
    van Gelder: Is this the same kind of dynamic about debt that leads
to emergency managers who then turn over the reins of the economy to
private enterprises? The same thing that you are seeing in third-world
    Perkins: Yes, when I was an economic hit man, one of the things
that we did, we raised these huge loans for these countries, but the
money never actually went to the countries, it went to our own
corporations to build infrastructure in those countries. And when the
countries could not pay off their debt, we insisted that they
privatize their water systems, their sewage systems, their electric
    van Gelder: I want to ask you about the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
and other trade deals. Is there any way that we can beat these things
back so they don’t continue supercharging the corporate sphere at the
expense of local democracies?
    Perkins: They’re devastating; they give sovereignty to
corporations over governments. It’s ridiculous.
    I was just in Central America and what we talk about in the U.S.
as being an immigration problem is really a trade agreement problem.
    They’re not allowed to impose tariffs under the trade
agreements—NAFTA and CAFTA—but the U.S. is allowed to subsidize its
farmers. Those governments can’t afford to subsidize their farmers. So
our farmers can undercut theirs, and that’s destroyed the economies,
and a number of other things, and that’s why we’ve got immigration
    van Gelder: Can you talk about the violence that people are
fleeing in Central America, and how that links back to the role the
U.S. has had there?
    Perkins: Three or four years ago the CIA orchestrated a coup
against the democratically elected president of Honduras, President
Zelaya, because he stood up to Dole and Chiquita and some other big,
global, basically U.S.-based corporations.
    He wanted to raise the minimum wage to a reasonable level, and he
wanted some land reform that would make sure that his own people were
able to make money off their own land, rather than having big
international corporations do it.
    The big corporations couldn’t stand for this. He wasn’t
assassinated but he was overthrown in a coup and sent to another
country, and replaced by a terribly brutal dictator, and today
Honduras is one of the most violent, homicidal countries in the
    It’s frightening what we’ve done. And when that happens to a
president, it sends a message to every other president throughout the
hemisphere, and in fact throughout the world: Don’t mess with us.
Don’t mess with the big corporations. Either cooperate and get rich in
the process, and have all your friends and family get rich in the
process, or go get overthrown or assassinated. It’s a very strong
That is how a once proud nation gets transformed into a rancid,

Downloading torrents isn't a crime. It's a civil matter, there is no

The argument could be made that their advertising revenues discourage

maximize revenues before the guillotine drops. So in practice: turn

Intending to raise awareness of issues around the primary foundation
of capitalism ("property rights") is not a bad thing per se.
But I have concerns with this already
- Reuters to me is MSM
- 'a billion readers a day'
- 'aims to generate and curate trusted news' yeah I'm sure they do,
but is this something you say?
- "the world’s first global news team dedicated to coverage of land
and property rights" sounds like an agenda about to be pushed by the
current MSM/ planetary power brokers
- "the launch of a new digital platform" - GTFOOH, a new digital
platform! aren't we all going to be impressed - Yee Haw people,
someone's about to save the world (now where's an old Sega system)
My greatest concern is that this media platform could be a foundation
for promoting and facilitating changes which will empower capitalist
opportunism enslaving people to a greater and greater degree - i.e.
empowering those who already have monetary power in the world to
increase their monetary power over those in the world who they
currently have difficulty enslaving due to LACK of property ownership
Stability of community and family requires stability of:
- access to clean water for drinking, cooking and growing food
- right to use land to grow food
- warmth, i.e. a roof and heating and cooking ability
- and prosperity requires (I think) the right to freedom of free and
anonymous travel.
"Inordinate wealth" (i.e. enslaving other humans) can be achieved with
property ownership - the owner then becomes a land lord, collecting
rent; that's difficult to achieve with NO property ownership - i.e. if
you're allowed to live in your house without paying rent, grow food
without someone taking that food, and barter than food and your work
efforts without being taxed and can travel freely, then you are
essentially free - BUT land and property OWNERSHIP fucks that all up.
Ownership of land per se is not a prerequisite to stable and abundant
community, and indeed "ownership" of land has ultimately been the
foundation of Western society's --massive-- wealth divide. Phrases
like "rent seekers", opportunists, rates and taxation, leverage of
capital and ultimately widespread economic slavery ought come to mind
at this point...
Russia is still giving plots of land to its people, and does not allow
sale inside of the first 5 years of ownership. My view is that this
time period should be greater, or perhaps documents should be made
readily available so those who are inclined, protect said land for
their grandchildren's use (and not sale) in a legal trust.
(I'll grant the original marketing material is pretty slick, but
bypasses a metric tonne of important, --foundation-- considerations;
agenda or ignorance, take your pick.)

On slashdullits today, face recognition at around 70% - I assume this
will only increase.
Now imagine your local police at a local RBT stop, where the RBT
machine scans your eye for your genetic eyeprint.
When we're talking "mandatory chip implant" we're talking "control by
law enforcement, military and other government entities at 'papers
please!' checkpoints" such as RBT etc.
With biometric ID, they need no chip.
Build your local group of rights defenders or this tyranny will
continue to systematically increase. The right of travel has been
turned into a "get permission from govt with a 'license' to travel";
right to choose how when and where to medicate your body is soon to be
taken (here in Australia, no jab, no pay, as in, you don't vaccinate
your child, your social security blanket is taken); fluoride in the
water also violates our right to choose how we medicate our bodies -
without money, you will consume fluoride; right to communicate
anonymously? well round here we're very familiar with the attacks on
-that- human right.
And the list goes on...

Someone emailed me this clip - it's about 20MiB, so I thought it
might, just possibly, slight hunch you know, be considered excessive
to include the attachment to cp...
For those who didn't know, Ford sued the US govt after WWII for the
US' bombing of his factories in Germany (which were producing tanks
etc for Germany), and he won - with a quote, when questioned about
such an audacious claim, Ford, from the witness box said something
along the lines of "my dear fellow, some matters are above mere
international rivalry".
This extract however puts the position "WWII was the first time in
history that the wealthy elite could purchase the thuggery of an
entire nation".
Worth a look see.

There's no point in being a victim
Rita Panahi
Where do you rank in the Oppression Olympics? Are you floundering at
the bottom of the table among the privileged white, Christian,
heteronormative cisgender males with no moral authority to speak on
any issue? Or are you going for gold as a transgendered pansexual
Muslim woman of colour?
There was a time when a person’s status was determined by their birth;
those fortunate enough to belong to the aristocracy were judged to be
our moral and intellectual superiors.
Now there’s a new and even more toxic pecking order that determines
one’s acceptability and authority to speak on a range of issues. The
new aristocracy is determined by one’s victimhood status; the more
grievance points you accumulate, the greater your mandate to preach.
Of course, if you don’t identify as a victim then your oppression
ranking plummets to Anglo-male depths, but if you play the game right,
you can use your grievance status to score plum roles as well as dodge
all responsibility if you happen to fail miserably. One popular tactic
among the victimhood brigade is the refusal to accept any criticism
that comes from those who are of a different race, religion, gender,
sexuality or whatever else differentiates you.
Men should not speak about feminism, whites should butt out of black
or ethnic debates, and non-Muslims should never pass judgment on
Last week soon-to-be-retired Senator Nova Peris rejected the opinions
of those who don’t share her oppression ranking.
“Until you are an Aboriginal person, don’t criticise me,” she said.
Really? Can I play that card the next time I receive unhinged abuse
from the always bitter and outraged feminist frightbats who are
invariably middle-class white women? From now on my standard response
to any and all criticism will be: “Unless you are an American-born
Persian Australian, don’t judge me.”
Let's remember that Peris isn't some disempowered victim; indeed she's
been treated better than most in her short political career.
Allegations that Peris used taxpayer money to carry out an
extramarital affair would have ended most political careers but she
survived and earned a few extra grievance points by painting herself
as the victim.
While working for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander Studies, Peris was involved in a decision to bring her
lover, Olympian Ato Boldon, to Australia for a 10-day tryst
interrupted by a few athletic workshops.
However when the scandal was revealed, and again last week, there was
no shortage of media pundits eager to characterise any criticism of
Peris as racially motivated.
We see the same simplistic arguments put forward claiming only
indigenous people are entitled to an opinion on Australia Day, or
Invasion Day, or whenever matters concerning  the indigenous community
are debated.
How absurd to think that all people of a particular race or religion
share the same values and viewpoints and will have their “side”
adequately covered by an ethnically-appropriate representative.
Those who demand that every member of a particular minority group
think and vote the same way are guilty of the sort of closeminded
prejudice that the Left used to rail against.
It's not just a local phenomenon - Egyptian feminist Mona Hathaway, a
favourite of the Q&A set, recently demanded that only Muslim women
speak about the religion's many problems, particularly with veiling.
“If you're white/ not a Muslim woman: shut up and listen to us, Muslim
women,” she tweeted.
Victimhood does not equal moral superiority, particularly when in your
eagerness to establish your victimhood status you ignore real victims.
Western feminists who turn their back on oppressed women while getting
worked up about non-issues such as gendered toys and “sexist air
conditioners” are not noble warriors, merely trolls.
Ordinarily I'd be the type of minority the average Leftie would be
delighted to embrace given my many oppression points: woman of colour,
Middle Eastern refugee, atheist, single mother - if I was also a
lesbian with a disability I'd have hit the diversity jackpot.
And that's part of the problem. Many progressives consider diversity a
disability to be overcome. The victimhood they seek signifies for them
a struggle that is often entirely in their own minds.
My failure to see my ethnic origin as some sort of handicap is deemed
The fact that I don't view Australia as an inherently racist country
ruled by monstrous patriarchy riles them even more.
Unlike most Western feminists who have abandoned their sisters in the
Muslim world, I won't stay silent about the systematic subjugation of
women in the name of Islam.
That I won't frame my opinions in a manner that pushes daft social
justice agendas that are short on justice and high on propagating
falsehoods is the final deal breaker.
All of that combines to negate any oppresion points I've accumulated
and casts me as an enemy of your average Leftist, or progressive as
they prefer to be called. Those people believe that if you don't
subscribe to their dippy worldview you're suffering from internal
misogyny and racism. That's intellectually vacuous and it's at the
heart of the social justice activism that's taken hold of much of
Is it any surprise universities are increasingly banning free speech
and creating “safe spaces” to spare their delicate student populations
from the only diversity they hate - the diversity of opinion?
Identity politics that portrays victimhood as something to be lauded
is counter-productive and divisive.
Only a bigot would dismiss someone's opinion based on their race,
religion, gender or sexuality.
