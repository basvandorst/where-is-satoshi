@_subject: hearing on Nov. 15 at 10 am in Gilmore v. NSA case 
Many of you know of John Gilmore's Freedom of Information Act lawsuit
against NSA, which was written up in WIRED.
In September, Judge Henderson dismissed the case, ruling that there
was no claim for an injunction against NSA for its regular, routine
failure to respond to FOIA requests within the time limits provided
by the law.  John has moved for reconsideration of the dismissal on a variety of
legal grounds.  The hearing on Monday 11/15 10 a.m. is in Courtroom
12, on the 19th floor of the U.S. Courthouse, 450 Golden Gate Ave.,
San Francisco.  Lee Tien

@_subject: FOIA lawsuit re Clipper 
John Gilmore wanted me to let the list know that there will be a
hearing this Friday, Oct. 29, at the Federal Courthouse at 450
Golden Gate in SF, around 9:30 am (time is always unclear), in
his FOIA suit against the FBI/DOJ re release of documents in the
Clipper Chip matter.
Very briefly, we have received some mostly uninteresting documents
regarding Clipper so far.  We moved for an index of the withheld
documents and for expedited processing.  The gov't response was to move for a stay of proceedings until
early 1997.  That's not a typo-- almost 4 years!
We sent them some discovery as to their FOIA processing, and
they then moved for a protective order barring discovery.
So basically, what we're going to be arguing about on Friday
is whether the case moves forward, or gets put on hold until
the FBI gets around to processing John's request.  John encourages interested cypherpunks to attend.  He will not
be there himself.  Feel free to e-mail me, Lee Tien, for details.  I prefer to
be reached at tien at well.sf.ca.us.

@_subject: Whit Diffie's comments 
A few days ago John Gilmore forwarded some comments from Whit.
I was curious about one in particular, where Whit said:
"Despite all the assurances, there is another trap door in the algorithm that will be used in reading foreign traffic.  A publicly
[sic] explainable mechanism is needed if the intercepts are to be used
in court, but not if they are to be 'Handled Via COMINT Channels Only.'"
I don't understand this comment -- at least I don't think I do.  Is
this a reference to some provision of federal law or a secret directive?
I dimly recall from my reading of Bamford, or some other book about the intelligence agencies, that there's a statutory "NSA exception"
re electronic interceptions.  Is that what's being referred to here?
If so, can anyone provide a citation?  I'd like to take a look at it.

Sunday's NYTMagazine had an amusing bit in its "Sunday" column, titled:

"The scrambling and decoding of electronic communication is one of the hottest issues in cyberpolitics.  The Government would like to have
the key to all communications.  Export of cryptographic software is
restricted.  Both software companies and independent groups like the
Cypherpunks argue for the rights of individual privacy."
"All of which makes Microsoft's new Creative Writer software for
children intriguing.  It includes some primitive cryptographic tools
to enable kids to encode what they write ... to hide it from curious
siblings and F.B.I. agents."
What surprised me was the next line -- "Theoretically, this product
would come under export restrictions, even though the code would not
challenge a spy, let alone a bright 9-year-old."
After explaining what a Caesar substitution cipher is, the bit goes
on to note that "Presumably, Microsoft will not face any difficulties in exporting its product even though it comes from

it does instruct the youth of America in the basics of electronic

@_subject: Crypto and 4th A. 
Roy:  I'm a lawyer, and I've not run across any law review articles that discuss cryptography in relation to privacy or Fourth Amendment rights.  The classic treatise on Fourth Amendment search and seizure is by LaFave.  I haven't looked at it recently, but it might discuss crypto.  One "brute-force" approach to the legal literature is to go to the law library and scan the Index to Legal Periodicals, which is organized by subject as well as author.  I don't think you'll find anything under crypto, but you'll find LOTS of stuff about the Fourth Amendment.  It'll take time, but by scanning the titles of the articles you'll be able to tell if there's anything about crypto.  Some law libraries also have an index of recent articles on CD-
ROM, which is easier to search but is typically less Also check under the name Tribe, L.  Tribe is the nation's leading constitutional scholar IMHO and at the first Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy he gave a talk on "technology and the Constitution."  I don't recall his talking about crypto at all, but he did use as an example the cases involving privacy and wiretapping, i.e., Olmstead v. U.S., Katz v. U.S.
Katz is the case which set forth the notion of "reasonable expectation of privacy."  (REP)  Tribe was a Supreme Court clerk who worked on this opinion, I believe.
Tribe's one-volume treatise, "American Constitutional Law," briefly discusses constitutional dimensions of privacy law in one section.  It is good, but only current up to 1988, as I recall.
Having said that, it becomes obvious that you may want to focus on the law of REP and how it intersects with technological change.  For instance, advocates of Digital Telephony, Clipper et al often make the argument that "we're only trying to maintain the status quo -- we just want to keep the existing practical balance that comes from most communications being plaintext."
Yet in the same discussion -- almost in the same breath -- the same advocates of "maintaining the status quo" will remind you that you have NO REP in such things as your hair fibers, DNA obtained from saliva under a postage stamp, etc., and therefore "we don't need a search warrant."  Clearly, forensic technologies have improved greatly over the years, but the law has not consistently followed a "status quo" approach.  Law enforcement is better described as having a "ratchet" approach; they want to keep all the gains from improvements in forensic and surveillance technology, but not the losses.  (I am indebted to Mike Godwin of EFF for this point, which he made publicly in a panel with an Assistant U.S. Attorney back in January.)
BTW, keep in mind that there's an (arguably) crucial difference between the privacy implications of something like hair fiber or DNA forensic analysis and encryption/decryption relative to communications.  Analyzing my hair fibers reveals no information about anyone else.  With most communications there is a threat to the privacy of more than one person.  I'm curious -- what's the thesis or general thrust of your article?  I could say more, but that's probably enough for now.  We can take this discussion to e-mail rather than the list if Cypherpunks find it too tangential.  Lee Tien

@_subject: Use of PGP as an export? 
Actually, the ITAR contains specific provisions for "defense services," and
it is possible to "export" "defense services."  Lee Tien
That's not giving technical data to the foreigner, that's providing a service;
the ITAR doesn't seem to restrict that.  It's not an especially secure way to
operate, but that's an inherent problem with multi-user systems or file servers.
One way to implement it that would be only mildly insecure would be to put PGP
on a file server, with execute-only permissions; users of client machines
still could be attacked by somebody faking out NFS, but they wouldn't have
to send their passphrases across the net the way they would in a telnet session.

@_subject: Exporting software doesn't mean exporting (was: Re: lp ?) 
I realize I'm a little late in this thread, but I'm pretty far behind in my
e-mail.  I oversimplify here, but what's new.
Anyway, all I wanted to say is that treaties are *not* superior to acts of
Congress, as far as I know (they do override state law).  I'm not an
international lawyer, but it was held long ago that a properly ratified
treaty is "equivalent to an act of the legislature."  Foster v. Neilson, 27
U.S. (2 Pet.) 253, 314 (1829) (Marshall, C.J.).  Note also that a treaty is
not necessarily self-executing; if it requires appropriation of funds,
Congress needs to act again.  Whether Congress may decline to implement is
unclear.  Finally, the Supreme Court has also held that when there is conflict
between an Act of Congress and a treaty, "the last expression of the
sovereign will must control."  The Chinese Exclusion Case, 130 U.S. 581
(1889).  Treaties may still bind the U.S. internationally, putting the U.S. in
default.  But a U.S. person would not be able to enforce any treaty-based
claim if a later U.S. law conflicts, at least in a U.S. court.  P.S.  I'm not aware of telecom treaties that would shield one from ITAR
violations, but would be interested to know of any.  I generally refrain
from public comment on ITAR because we are in litigation, as most of you

@_subject: crypto/classification 
A few weeks ago someone posted the following message:
Hi all,
Just received a memo, the "Desk Reference Guide" to Executive Order 12958.
This memo/executive order discusses classified national security
information.  The cypherpunks-interesting aspect of this memo lies in
exceptions to some new guidelines.  Basically, this executive order
removes the authority for the government to "permanently" classify
information.  Basically, classification is now limited to 10 years
(or 25 years in some special cases).  The exceptions to this allow
classification for longer durations for certain types of material.
These types include things like protecting intelligence sources and nuclear weapons design info.  One of the other exeptions is for:
"...information that would impair United States cryptologic systems
or activities."
This appears to be taken directly from the executive order, so these
types of decisions are being made at high levels.  Thought you might
be interested.
        Hooker
I'm curious whether the "desk reference" contains more than the mere text
of the Executive Order.  If it does, I'd like to get a copy, since the FOIA
cases I handle typically involve classified information.
Please reply personally, since I only read the list in digest form.

@_subject: Encryption and the 2nd Amendment 
I agree that a 2nd A. argument is legally worthless; so do Mike Godwin and
other persons whose legal opinions are generally carefully considered.  FWIW, I note that one gov't study of the constitutionality of encryption
restrictions, done by some law profs for DOEnergy, had a section surveying
the possible applicability of the 2nd A.  Since we are not using this
argument in Bernstein, I didn't read the section with any care.  The thrust
was, if I recall correctly, that even if the 2nd A did apply, it has so
little force that it doesn't matter (i.e., one can't easily point to
doctrine calling for "heightened" or "strict" scrutiny under the 2nd; I
happen to believe that there should be some form of scrutiny beyond
"rational basis" for infringement of 2nd A. rights, having been impressed
by Sanford Levinson's analysis, but the cases do not support it).
I suspect that one reason why folks find this approach rhetorically
interesting is that it's got that "you called it that, so . . . " flavor. In a different post on a different issue, Perry Metzger referred to
estoppel, and I think the same intuition operates here. But as Michael
Froomkin said, what the State Department calls it shouldn't be relevant to
the meaning for constitutional purposes.  Also, estoppel against the
government is quite limited.  There's a line of cases saying that, and
courts frequently refuse to hold the government to the same kind of
estoppel as private parties.  (Agreeing w/Peter Junger)

@_subject: RC2 Source Code - Legal Warning from RSADSI 
I don't practice intellectual property law, but I think y'all should be
careful, legally speaking.  Without more facts, you don't know if the
purported disassembly was lawful.  I think the first and second sentences don't map.  It's true that once a
trade secret is "lost," it's lost (though I suppose if everyone forgets it
and someone rediscovers and protects it it's regained).
But you must distinguish between *legally* lost and merely practically
disseminated.  Trade secrecy is not complete or real secrecy.  If I were
under NDA to RSA to keep RC2 secret, passed it on to Rich, and RC2 met the
legal test for trade secrecy, it is still a trade secret in the law.  I
don't recall the remedies, but I'm fairly sure that if Rich has the right
level of knowledge/notice, he's not immune.
Trade secrecy is separate from either copyright or patent.  It covers both
patentable and nonpatentable stuff.  Its great advantage is its potential
duration -- so long as it's not independently generated or
reverse-engineered.  Its great drawback is it's hard to maintain.  I think Brian is right in what he said, but the critical qualification is
how the posted source code was produced.  One could have a trade secret in
the algorithm; Sega v. Accolade only addresses the copyright issues, if
memory serves.  The Ninth Circuit found that the dissassembly was
infringement, because it involved copying of the protected expression, but
excused the infringement based on "fair use."  *** Keep in mind that fair
use is multifactor, and the Sega decision expressly noted that Accolade was
only trying to achieve compatibility, only indirectly harming the market
for Sega's videogames.  This alone might distinguish disassembly to get RC2
source in order to put RC2 "out there," even from a copyright perspective.
What's unclear in the law is RSA's power to control dissassembly by
contract.  Traditionally, reverse engineering has always been a legitimate
means of penetrating trade secrecy.  The problem arises, though, if one
agrees not to reverse-engineer.  If I got an RSA product and agreed not to
disassemble and not to disclose anything I might happen to discover, then I
have a contractual, not statutory, duty.  This is like the shrink-wrap
license issue:  if I buy Lotus Notes, a shrink-wrap "no dissassembly"
provision may well be unenforceable.  Such a provision is more likely
enforceable in a truly bargained contract.  This is all contract law.
So if the person who disassembled was under a contractual bar, disassembly
could be misappropriation.  (I'm not clear on current misappropriation law,
which is in a statute in California if I recall.)
I'm not really up on all this, and it's very fact-sensitive, but I don't
think the legal issues are very simple, and I would counsel some caution. Are those enough qualifications and disclaimers?
