I doubt it.  If you're not enrolled at a major university, or employed
at a computer-related company, and don't subscribe to an expensive
online service, getting an internet account is NOT easy or cheap. Services like netcom are expanding, but I seriously doubt a homeless
person could get an internet address.  Check out almost any BBS network
(other than fido) and every other week, some jerk will ask when they'll
get connected to the internet.  And every time, five sysops respond
"Fine.  We'd love to.  Would you mind telling us how the hell we could
connect to the internet???"
