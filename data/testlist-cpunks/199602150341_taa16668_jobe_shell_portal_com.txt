@_subject: PING packets illegal? 
Some entity that called itself "Mark M." appears to have said:
That wasn't my point. I was talking about the host being pinged. Would that host be breaking ITAR regulations by sending those evil PGP-containing packets *back* to the foreign host?
Impossible, maybe. But that doesn't mean it can't be illegal. Take the CDA, for example. Fuck. Oops, Exon will be displeased. Am I going to be taken to jail? Most likely not. Was it illegal? Technically, yes.
