@_subject: [FoRK] Does the web have a public timestamper? 
That challenge only defeated Surety's general claim to all forms of digital
timestamping. There are other claims in the patent which still stand. The
useful of these is the chaining of hashes from one document to the next.
week, Surety publishes a cumulative hash in the New York Times.  Each new
document is signed by hashing the document, and sigining that hash combined
with the current, global, cumulative hash.  This ensures that nobody can
backdate a faked document.
I had long thought about implementing this technique in a user-friendly app,
where initial document hashing is done in client-side JavaScript. That would
protect customer data, yet not require a software download (as Surety does).
Applications include everything from dating the condition of something you
possession of (car, apartment, etc.), to dating blog entries to prove your
journalistic integrity (i.e., to prove you don't backdate).  With
software, you could offer timestamping for free and make your money with
on your validation pages.
It's funny, because this was a back-burner project I was planning on working
this morning.  But this thread led me to check the patent situation more
closely, and it seems to this layman that Surety's remaining patent claims
too powerful.
