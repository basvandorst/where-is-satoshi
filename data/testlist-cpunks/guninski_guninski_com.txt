@_subject: Should openssl accept weak DSA/DH keys with g = +/- 1 ? 
I am a noob at crypto.
IIRC similar attack was used against Tor
several years ago.
In DSA it is possible to force g=1 or g \equiv -1 \mod p.
The first is unit and the second is of multiplicative
order 2.
This are clearly weak and insane choices,
but this might have implications to MITM
(might be wrong on this).
For DH could generate key with g=1, though
couldn't test it.
Tested both 1 and -1 cases in DSA,
the probability of successful connection
was about 1/4 (or maybe 1/2), errors in the
other cases. (for $1$ I would expect probability
Attached are cacert.pem and cacert2.pem,
the magic word is 1234.
To test:
$ openssl s_server -accept 8888 -www -cert cacert.pem
$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:8888 -showcerts
To examine
$openssl x509 -text -in cacert2.pem
$openssl dhparam -text -in dHParam.pem
(not sure if dHParam.pem this is usable, forged generation).
Firefox refuses connections, Konqueror works
with same probability.
Suspect this might be related to EC refusing
the point at infinity.
Might have MITM implications, don't have
working exploit (If a MITM can forge $g=1$ in DH,
the private keys are useless).

This was mistake, both certs had g= -1.
With g=1 probability is $1$ in
openssl and Konqueror.
cacert3.pem is with g=1.

years (possibly causing troubles to other nations too).
Conjecture 3. USA will be bought by the People's Republic of China (PRC) in at most 5 years (possibly with other

DISCLAIMER: I am noob at electronics, this is crazy or
at best a fishing expedition...
Let $f$ be some hash function, say md5. Restrict the size of input
to be equal to the output (128 bits for md5).
Cryptographer told be it is open problem if there is
solution to $f(x)=x$ (treated as sequence of bits).
Implement $f$ as pure combinatorial circuit (NO CLOCK),
with 128 $i_k$ inputs and 128 outputs $o_k$.
For all $j$, connect $i_j$ with $o_j$ so the circuit
doesn't have neither inputs nor inputs (basically
loop the circuit $f$).
Power on.
Measure (possibly with oscilloscope) $i_j=o_j$.
If you are lucky to hit stable state, you have solved
In an unstable stable (no solution), maybe one will measure very
high frequency.
Probably this is well studied, though an
engineer couldn't find reference for the general case.
1. Are there references for this?
2. If it fails why will it fail?
3. If a solution exists is it known for how long it
will be found?
4. If the question is not entirely insane, is there better
Partial experimental results:
It wasn't easy, but me convinced an engineer to test it
on bare metal.
Take $n$ inverters (logical negation) and loop them
in a cycle (basically this corresponds to the cycle
graph $C_n$).
There are no input and no outputs.
For even $n$ the circuit has exactly 2 stable
For odd $n$, there is no stable state since
the boolean formula is unsatisfiable.
The engineer worked with NAND gates on a stand.
Experimentally, for $n=4$, the engineer reached
stable state.  Depending on which NAND gates he chose,
the stable state differed.
For $n=3$ there was no stable state.
The voltage was in the middle between logical 0-1,
possibly with high frequency which his oscilloscope
couldn't measure.
The engineer told me these circuits don't make
sense in electronics. (So what?).
I wouldn't trust a software simulation for this,
might be wrong.
The experiments were too simple, so it is
possible electric current to solve easy problems
and not solve hard problems.

Almost surely they can't fully parse the language they are Obfuscator need not produce the same output for the same

References: “But let me give you an example. We were planning along a number fronts.
I will just mention one. Take the case of the first few moments when the
banks are shut, the ATMs don’t function and there has to be some
parallel payment system by which to keep the economy going for a little
while, to give the population the feel that the state is in control and
that there is a plan.”

Definitions depend on context.
You mix "rich" and "intelligence" in one sentence --
in this context the majority/almost all of this list is likely
not rich, though they may have sufficiently money.
Also "intelligence community" appears non-standard definition.
Intelligence is military organization -- soldiers follow
orders depending on their rank. This is not the civil
definition of "community", maybe unless you consider
Obama "community of one".

Dude, this is a rant.
Why do you want "free markets" when the real world is rooted?
The majority of actors are just "rooted", so they are not
rational, irrational, ... hyper-transcendental, they are "rooted".
Capitalism is good on paper. Socialism is good on paper.
It is the realword implementation that matters, not the ad.

Its description mostly contained garbled text. Links for more

Please explain in simple words the IMPLEMENTATION of your New Order (in
case you have order).
In particular explain:
1. How do you distribute goods (food, shelter, shiny J-Pads, money? etc)
2. How do you deal with dishonest people and criminals?
3. How do you deal with people against your New Order?
4. How do you deal with current oligarchs in the New Order?
5. How do you prevent corruption?
IMHO a major problem is that sheeple are too buggy/easy to manipulate

If there is a negative real interest rate, it means that the inflation
rate is greater than the nominal interest rate. If the Federal funds
rate is 2% and the inflation rate is 10%, then the borrower would gain
7.27% of every dollar borrowed per year.
Since 2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining negative real interest
rates on government debt, meaning the inflation rate is greater than the
interest rate paid on the debt.[29]

Possible crypto backdoor in RFC-2631 Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Method
I am n00b at crypto so this might not make any sense.
In DH, if one can select group parameters (g,q,p) he can break both parties
private very fast time IMHO.
The RFC:  The main problem appears:
2.2.2.  Group Parameter Validation
   The ASN.1 for DH keys in [PKIX] includes elements j and validation-
   Parms which MAY be used by recipients of a key to verify that the
   group parameters were correctly generated. Two checks are possible:
     1. Verify that p=qj + 1. This demonstrates that the parameters meet
        the X9.42 parameter criteria.
     2. Verify that when the p,q generation procedure of [FIPS-186]
        Appendix 2 is followed with seed 'seed', that p is found when
        'counter' = pgenCounter.
The main problem appears MAY.
As I read it, implementation MAY NOT verify it.
Sketch of the attack:
Chose $q$ product of small primes $p_i$.
Solve the discrete logarithm modulo $p_i$ for the public keys.
Apply the Chinese remainder theorem to get the privates keys.
(This is well known method for DL and for this reason
the group order must be prime [160 bits ;)]).
Would be interested how implementations implement this MAY.
Let me know if there is better list for this.

2631 is on wikipedia's page for DH.
Another concern for backdoor is the FIPS in this thread,
which requires small subgroup (as low as 160 bits).
Having in mind for generic primes DL is subexponential
(IIRC something like GNFS), the complexity of DL in
small subgroup is questionable.
Just to note so far this thread questions:
1. DH's RFC
2. DSA as implemented by openssl
3. FIPS requiring small subgroup.

IMHO RFC must use only MUST or "MUST NOT" to make
the ``formal model'' soundly defined (recursively RFC compliant).
Suppose implementation X1 follows MAY and X2 does not.
Observe that in real world neither X1 nor X2 need be
RFC compliant (like malware).
Even if they are compliant, this might cause troubles.
In my DSA SSL example (which might be technical bug in openssl,
but not necessarily technical bug in hypothetical DH implementation),
the key/cert wasn't RFC compliant, but passed verification.

OK, you might be right.
Summary of my verbiage on this list is here:
besides DH:
2) openssl 1.0.1p accepts composite $q$ in DSA
3) fips 160? forces small subgroup as low as 160 bits
and openssl 1.0.1p insists on this.
The repeat, the DL is subexponential in the whole group
of order $p-1$ and I don't exclude the possibility to
be easier in the small forced subgroup.

Re "formal verification".
I am skidiot at formal verification (FW).
So far my best achievement in FW is
"Axiom free proof of False" in Coq (is it Cock?).
I did this by native code execution via plugins
in Coq (the plugins were part of the "pr00f"),
which in theory can falsify other proofs
depending on the file permissions.
Much letter I learned that the lovely micro$oft
heavily depend on plugins in their Cock "pr00fs" and
accidentally something broke the check of the
"pr00f" for result of significant importance (something like "coqchk") due to some fault in the plugin and/or Coq.
The p00f failure was discussed on academic site.
In short, I consider Coq a charlatan tool,
and likely security vulnerability, since a proof
can easily execute native code.
Let me know if you need further references.

ECC appears controversial:
Update: This is really just meant as a primer, as background on the
issue, not really trying to derive any conclusions. I chatted a bit
Chris Evans ( from google about some of those conclusion,
so I thought I'd expand a bit on them.
Does ECC protect you? Maybe not. While it will correct single bit flips
most of the time, it won't protect when multiple bits flip at once. The
hacker may be able to achieve this with enough tries. Remember: the
hacker's code can keep retrying this until it succeeds, even if that
takes hours.

I don't understand hardware and have some questions
The POC appears non-deterministic per the nature of the bug.
1. If I run the POC for time X and it fails, does
this mean it will fail if I run it for time 100 X?
2. Does increasing the temperature in the box
(near or above overheating) increase the chance for
3. If you have computer near you, can you induce bit
flips on purpose remotely, without executing code on
it? (lol, AFAICT if you wait looooong enough cosmic rays

@_subject: Why libressl-2.2.3 and openssl-1.0.1p accept very weak elliptic 
Summary:  libressl-2.2.3 and openssl-1.0.1p appear to accept elliptic
curves which might be broken by Pollard's rho DL in O(2^56) or O(2^82)
group operations
Pollard's rho DL algorithm [1] solves discrete logarithm in O(\sqrt{n})
where n is the group order. Equivalently the complexity is
Both libressl-2.2.3 and openssl-1.0.1p have curves with
log_2{n}=112 and NIST curve with log_2{n}=163.
Assuming Pollard's rho succeeds, the complexity is O(2^56) and O(2^82)
group operations.
The first is close to real time on ``nice hardware''.
To reproduce:
$ ~/inst/openssl-1.0.1p/apps/openssl ecparam -list_curves
 secp112r1 : SECG/WTLS curve over a 112 bit prime field
  sect163k1 : NIST/SECG/WTLS curve over a 163 bit binary field
$ ~/inst/libressl-2.2.3/apps/openssl ecparam -list_curves|grep -i ' 1'
   secp112r1 : SECG/WTLS curve over a 112 bit prime field
   sect163k1 : NIST/SECG/WTLS curve over a 163 bit binary field
For reference,
Bitcoin networks surpasses 2^80 hashes per week
I believe in an Edward model of EC, the group operation on the EC
isn't much slower than Bitcoin SHA hash, so someone with such
resources might break ...2r1 in nearly real time and ...3k1 in few
This resembles the ``DSA oddity'' of _forcing_ q as low as 160
bits, giving the same level (to ...3k1) of security compared to
DSA as shown at [2], search for "160"

Thanks for the answer.
So the DLOG records (Wikipedia gives 113 bits [1] as of 2010)
break these in libressl/openssl:
$ ./inst/libressl-2.2.3/apps/openssl ecparam -list_curves
secp112r1 : SECG/WTLS curve over a 112 bit prime field
secp112r2 : SECG curve over a 112 bit prime field
And these are in quite gray area?
secp128r1 : SECG curve over a 128 bit prime field
secp128r2 : SECG curve over a 128 bit prime field
And what is the computational power of the Bitcoin network
(Allegedly they do 2^80 SHA hashes per week) in terms of

Your argument raises the question about the soundness
of the so called ``theory of many eyes''.
libressl/openssl ship elliptic curves of low quality,
and they can be detected by man documented command.
The low quality of the curves can be checked by going
to wikipedia's page about ECC dlog records.
AFAICT they probably implemented backdoored RFC (don't know if they knew it is backdoored).
This raises the question about more obscure features
buried in, say, obscure macros, misleading comments, etc.
No math knowledge required, but the low quality curves are weaker
that the backdoored DSA via generic dlog attack, unless
DSA allows much faster dlog in the small subgroup by exploiting the sub-exponential attack of dlog modulo $p$
(or some other attack).

Volkswagen is being rightly condemned from all directions, as its
methods were particularly cynical: its engine software would sense when
the car was in a test environment and cut back NO_x output temporarily.
As soon as the car was no longer under test, the car would change mode
and emit huge amounts of NO_x. This wasn't done for no reason – if a
machine is allowed to generate NO_x freely, it can be very
fuel-efficient – and thus, of course, its carbon emissions can be very
low too.
Probably best defense for VW lawyers is:
"We got hacked and the hack made this.

AFAICT this was discovered by scholars, not regulators
(check wikipedia link).
Cheating EPA appears to be common practice:
In 1973, Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Toyota, and
Volkswagen had to remove ambient temperature switches which affected
emissions, though the companies denied intentional cheating and said
that strategies like enriching fuel mixture during cold engine warm-up
periods could reduce overall pollution.
In 1996 General Motors had to pay a near-record fine of $11 million, and
had to recall almost as many cars as Volkswagen's US TDI diesels,
470,000, when they, like Volkswagen, programmed ECU software to
disengage emissions controls during conditions known to exist when the
cars were not being lab tested by the EPA.
There are more cases linked.

I don't know if freedompress are "evil entity", but if they
are evil entity, they could have chosen clean provider and
cooperate with other evil entities.
IMHO the nsa and the like have spoofing/MITM certs trusted by
major browsers, so I don't trust TLS/SSL from a browser as
used by the majority of user.
Might be wrong on both.

Strongly disagree. Allowing longer keys doesn't hurt, except for more
resources (and possibly false sense of security).

Disclaimer: I am lamer in physics.
I think the analogy shows that FTL (superluminal) speed exist and is
experimentally observed, this doesn't contradict relativity.
What contradicts relativity is _communication_ or clock synchronization
faster than light.
IIRC if you point powerful projector at the Moon and move it slightly,
this light on Moon will move FTL at least from your point of view. Jim's horse was something like this.
Check wikipedia for faster than light for more examples like this.

IIRC relativity has formulas with factors of the form

The bitcoin addresses look somewhat weird to me.
IIRC they are formed from some crypto stuff of the user and the user
has _some_ control of it at least via bruteforce.
I suspect the user can't chose the address directly.
Here are the addresses in the last transactions, spaces added by me:
1 never 9kNNkr27UseZSHnaEHg1z8v3Mbb
1 gonna V3MFNjymS4RGvUbHACstiS8aSYz

RE:  cost of ownage/minor offenses.
Don't exclude the possibility single investment to result
in compromise of all of Tor and then deanonimizing will
be just a simple query.
In one Snowden slide there was something like:
"NSA can deanonimize some Tor users ...
but we don't want to scare all of them".
This is consistent with the fate of Lulzsec.
According to the official story (which I don't believe),

GnuPG's ElGamal signing keys compromised
Phong Nguyen identified a severe bug in the way GnuPG creates and uses
ElGamal keys for signing.  This is a significant security failure
which can lead to a compromise of almost all ElGamal keys used for
signing.  Note that this is a real world vulnerability which will
reveal your private key within a few seconds.
Do you mean to see more like this from gpg?
IIRC gpg used small number, to save picoseconds in computations
and the attack fucked them with lattice reduction in nanoseconds...
Not to mention the compatibility with pgp 0.0001, which makes
keyid collisions trivial (the ubuntu comrades suffered from this

Long ago, an old man told me wars like in Vietnam were done for beta

First they poison them, then they ``heal'' them...
In the years following the Vietnam War reports, of high rates of miscarriages, premature births, congenital birth defects, and infant mortality began to surface from regions in Vietnam where Agent Orange was used.
the United States Government passed the Agent Orange Act. This act mandates the US government to pay for the medical care of any Vietnam War veteran, regardless of length of service, related to an Agent Orange disease.
IIRC, the USA gave its Vietnamese soldiers psychoactive drugs (some
for being brave) and some of the drugs were found to have very
adverse side effects. Don't have better reference ATM than this:
The British philosopher Nick Land aptly described the Vietnam War as “a decisive point of intersection between pharmacology and the technology of violence.”
Committee on Crime revealed that from 1966 to 1969, the armed forces had used 225 million tablets of stimulants, mostly Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine), an amphetamine derivative that is nearly twice as strong as the Benzedrine used in the Second World War.

I may be wrong on this, just a personal opinion about bulgaria.

work -- there was lack of some goods and services, not of first need
ones. Essentially there was no poverty. Nowadays, retired people are
literally poor. They can hardly afford to pay the food, bills and

AFAICT, the lib gives you high precision time _in the browser_, but this

To get it, you use the network which is of unknown latency (unless you

1. When you got the time
2. When you received the time

They aren't no fools. In simple words this is business/profit at all
I remember the Chernobyl disaster being relatively near and its causes are quite controversial, especially for anti-russians.
Is there relatively objective study about the damages Fukushima vs
(What I read was flamewars or propaganda).

Apologies for offtopic (this might be mildly ontopic about the current
state of crypto in open source).
Would someone please check if links2 and elinks verify certificates on
fresh install of Debian 8?
To verify, try to open site which doesn't properly chain to trusted
root, say  (unless you trust their root ) and check
if it opens or there is error/warning.
For me, on updated system, both don't verify certificates.
Looks like at least ubuntu and fedora killed the elinks bug long ago.
Searching the web for "$browser self signed certificate" shows some
relevant results.

Searching the web for "fukushima anomalies newborn" shows contradicting

The damage need not be now, it may be in the future.
As a living experiment, the Japanese might be more interesting for
consequences of being nuked by the usa in WWII.

I heard the Fukushima reactors were not secure compared to others, they
are "single contour".
Whether the Japanese would have blown better reactor is not clear to me.
Do reactors have guarantee? For how long? Were the Fukushima reactors
in guarantee?

I doubt this.
m$ named their signing keys NSAKEY (look it up on wikipedia).
Have there been requests m$ to unlock phone/computer?
What if m$ gave to the NSA update signing certificate?
Heard rumors that the majority of m$ developers, developers!!! see
very small fraction of the source, so likely the potential backdoors are
kept very well.
As an aside, vaguely remember that someone leaked something of little
importance (likely screenshots or prerelease). They used _hotmail_ to send
the stuff to journos and as expected got caught.

Just for a start, why the elliptic curve is of so small order, only 256
I am pretty sure in the early days of PGP, some PGP advocate claimed
something along the lines "we can't factor 128 bit modulus till the end
of time".
Not to mention quantum computer will fuck the curve fast.

Yes, it is known that quantum computers will break at least most of today's
public key crypto (factoring, discrete logarithms) very efficiently.
Several years ago IBM tested this in practice with the toy experiment of
factoring 15.
Some cryptographers are preparing for the day when quantum computers
will come -- the buzzword is "post-quantum cryptography".
I am a newbie at this and suspect the full potential of quantum
computers is not currently known (AFAICT it is open if they will break SAT).
