You oughta go out and borrow someone's shortwave radio or ham HF radio. Between 3900 and 3900 KHz every evening, a bunch of guys in the south
(Texas, New Mexico, Arkansas, Louisiana) get on the air and talk about the
"goddamn niggers, jews, and fags that are ruining this country."  All
kinds of folks (meaning non-WASPs, of course) are targeted for this kind
of spew.  Words like "motherfucker" are often used, especially against
"niggers".  The speakers rail against "white women with goddamn niggers",
and any other non-WASP who happens to arouse their ire. Quite entertaining if you enjoy that sort of thing.  Stomach-turning if
you don't.  Call signs, times and frequencies heard upon request. This sort of thing has been going on for years.  A few years back, the FCC
attempted to go after a couple of idiots on one of the local LA area 2m
repeaters who were spewing all kinds of filth out onto the air waves.  The
district court said, naaah, that's free speech. So, if the idiots in Congress want to go after this sort of thing, they
oughts go after the few hams that are ruining the hobby for the rest of
us. Ed Carp, N7EKG    			Ed.Carp at linux.org, ecarp at netcom.com

That all depends on the power level, and the emission pattern of the device, and the frequency.  I've been working within 10 feet of a dipole being fed by a 1kW amplifier before, and it didn't make me sterile (but it might've loosened a filling or two ).
This sounds like absolute propoganda.  If you do the calculations, you'll see that a 1 watt transmitter sitting 100 feet away from your target will generate an EMF less than that 1000kW ERP TV transmitter array you just flew over.  If aircraft avionics were *that* sensitive, we'd have planes falling out of the sky, and we don't.  Add to that the HF and VHF transmitting equipment in the cockpit, plus the microwave ovens in the fore and aft, PLUS the phones they have on the plane, and it adds up to a sizeable amount of RF bouncing around the cabin without you and your 2m talkie with it's 6 dB loss rubber duckie.
Now, if every passenger fired up their 2m talkies, that might pose a problem, but then again every passenger wouldn't be using one, would they?
Again, sounds like "we want to totally control your environment for your safety (actually, to minimize our liability)" crap.

There have been many examples of this - several cases of hams having their pacemakers go nuts when they keyed their transmitters, etc.  But that doesn't mean that aviation avionics are sensitive - in fact, devices that are specifically designed to receive RF of a specific frequency are usually designed to reject RF of a different frequency, especially type accepted radios (the avionics package is required to be type accepted for that particular class of service, which includes spurious rejection, intermod products down XX dB, etc.)
A transistor radio puts out such a minute amount of RF (at 455 KHz and/or
10.7 MHz, the IF freqs of the radio) that most insturments designed to
pick up RF can't detect this stuff from more than a few feet away.  FCC
regulations say that if your avionics is being interfered with, it's YOUR
problem, not the guy that just turned on his radio.  If someone's avionics
is being interfered when I turn on an AM/FM transistor radio, then I'd say
that he either needs to get his avionics fixed, or he's using illegal
consumer-grade radios (which are usually junk anyway - even much ham radio
gear is garbage, unfortunately), instead of the type-accepted stuff he's
supposed to be using.  I'd be interested in finding out more about this
guy and his "VLS-jumped-when-someone-turned-on-their-radio" story. The early laptop computers would put out an amazing amount of crap.  I used to have a Zenith laptop, and when I'd turn the thing on, it'd throw out junk that I could hear on every radio in the house, including the 2m FM stuff, the HF rig, and I could even hear it out in my car on the 2m mobile!  I can believe it, but that's no excuse for just saying, "well, let's just ban all of it..."
My point is, it's not your, nor my responsibility to refrain from using our radios - it's the responsibility of the avionics people to make sure that their radios are within spec and are kept that way.  If they don't bother, that's not my fault.
Again, my contention is that they don't.
The ng rec.radio.amateur.misc might have some additional stuff in the FAQ,
and the ARRL certainly has a mountain of information on this - I'll poke
around.  'echo help|Mail info at arrl.org' might yield some interesting
things... Ed Carp, N7EKG    			Ed.Carp at linux.org, ecarp at netcom.com

@_subject: Zimmermann legal fund 
When I lived in California, I banked at Security Pacific, then changed
over my account to BofA.  When I left the bay area, I closed my account,
not knowing that someone had sat on a check for $120 - I thought it was me
just entering an ATM receipt twice (as I do from time to time).  So,
someone from a place called ChexSystems sends me a letter, saying "well,
you had a check go through and the bank paid it, please pay us."  So, I
send them the $120 or whatever it was. When I tried to open a checking acount in Utah, I find that I can't, for
the sole reason that I had been "reported to ChexSystems".  I explained
the situation to no avail.  BofA refuses to remove the charge, saying that
it's "against their policy".  ChexSystems refuses to do anything about it,
saying that "it was a valid debt", one which I neither knew about nor
agreed to.  If the bank would've mailed me a letter, saying that they
bounced the check, or paid it and please remit, I would've been happy to. Instead, they chose to try and screw me over by reporting the so-called
"debt" to some sort of check reporting system.  From my point of view, the
action by the bank was malicious and done with the intent of causing me
harm.  I don't recommend anyone doing business with BofA for this reason,
and I strongly urge that people immediately close their accounts with BofA,
refuse to do business with them, and switch to another bank which refuses
to participate in such malicious practices. I'm *not* impressed.
