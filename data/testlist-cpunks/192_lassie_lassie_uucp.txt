I see nobody mentioned the infringment of the second amendment by
the assault weapons ban.

YOU PEOPLE
ARE FOOLS AND HAVE TO MUCH SELF IMPORTANCE IN YOUR SMALL LITTLE
HEADS, NOTHING EXISTS OF OF INTERNET! WRONG THE REAL WORLD DOES!!!
BY NOT DISTRIBUTING TO THE MASSES YOU WILL LOSE (oh you can ftp to
toilet.flush /urinal/cookies/). WHEN THEY TAKE YOUR PRESIOS CRYPTO
AWAY, THEY WILL TAKE AWAY YOUR FIRST AMMENDMENT RIGHTS. (and it
serves you right). FUCK IT NEVER MIND
I'll beat Perry to it.
Interesting, but not about crypto, or the politics of crypto.
Take it to alt.flame.

Duh, how many takey coins will you give me if I do. You care less
about the politics of the first amendment or the effects crypto
has on it. The goal should be distribution to the masses of a
workable crypto program, shit you could even charge them play
money. IF 500 people have good crypto it's easy to legislate
against that. IF 500,000 people have good crypto it's hard to
legislate against that. If 5,000,000 people have good crypto it is
impossible to legislate against that. Talk all you want about
digital money and hearings, keyservers and politics but by the
people with out the clue (non-internet, non-ftp) having access to
the software then you have streangth. Without this you will
flounder and your precious crypto-clic will be broken up by the

No free man shall ever be de-barred the use of arms. The strongest
reason for the people to retain  there right to keep and bear arms
is as a last  resort to  protect  themselves  against  tyranny  in
