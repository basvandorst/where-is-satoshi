@_subject: PGP algorithm needed 
I am currently working on an encryption program for the Apple II user's on the net (there's quite a few of us out there) but without the
PGP algorithm it will be a useless utility.  Can someone E-mail it to me,
long with an credits that should be included so as not to step on
anyones toes.  Thanks in advance...
