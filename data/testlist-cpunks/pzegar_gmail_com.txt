"I miss the Soviet Union, at least they respected the personal and social
freedom (but, yes, I know Stalin was a lunatic). "
I hope you don't really believe that.

Well, we still do have museums like Belarus / North Corea, I would
recommend a one-year survival there ;-)

@_subject: Gruveo, more secure skype alternative? 
References: Even if technicaly they're so anonymous and afe as they claim to be, they
won't be an alternative for skype without accounts and "friend lists" etc.
It is just to hard to use for "average user".
Imagine when every time when you would like to chat or call someone via
skype, instead of make a double click on his position on the list, you
would have to let him know you want to speak, agree code and wait till he
get to the website... its quite problematic.
