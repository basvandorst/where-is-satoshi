@_subject: !FLAME: breaking DES 
OK, I sort of wanted to break up the constant flaming on this thread,
so I thought I would introduce my own (admittedly ignorant) way to break
     1. Start with a full keysearch of all 2^56 possible DES keys.
     2. If you have plaintext to work with, compare each sample decryption with the plaintext.
     2a. If you don't have plaintext, I would try washing the decryptions
through a pattern searching algorithm that would include a dictionary,
patterns from compression programs like PKZip, machine language instructions,
and any other possible form of communication that can be represented as
a binary string.
     At least that's how I would do it.  If anyone has any suggestions,
corrections, etc.  I wouldn't mind hearing them.

I remember hearing about how one congress member removed the taggants
from a sample of gunpowder using tweezers during a terrorism hearing.
Taggants can't really be relied upon.

The candy-like "family oriented" overcommercialized network is already
here, known as Prodigy.  Those guys will bounce your email if you say
"I have a bridge in Brooklyn for sale" (implying gullibility) for posting
commercially.  My subscription to those losers didn't last two months.
Last that I heard, Prodigy was losing money, hope they go broke.
Agreed.  So far as I know, there are a few commercial services that don't
censor their customers and aren't afraid to let them have full access to
the Internet, such as the WELL and Colorado Supernet.

Right now, it is a complete pain in the ass for me to encrypt or sign
messages using PGP.  The reason is because I have my email account on
one of CSU's unix machines, so I have to do my posting there, while
my PGP stuff lives on my PC in my apartment.  Usually, I check my mail
and read news by calling CSUNet over my modem, but if I want to encrypt,
decrypt, sign or check the signature of a message, I have to zmodem the
message to my machine, log off, decrypt or check the message while
offline (or at least shelled into DOS), type up a reply, manually encrypt
it and finally get back into my term program and zmodem the reply back
up to CSUNet and mail it.  I don't really want to run PGP on CSUNet, since
I don't trust their machines like I trust mine, but I am thinking about
doing that and generating a key which I would be wiling to use for less
secure stuff.  Anyone here have any other suggestions on making encryption
less of a pain?

I wouldn't mind seeing some script files and the like.  You just gave me an
idea, that is if I could figure out the script languages for Emacs, Elm, as
well as Qmodem.  It would be nice if I could automate the encryption/decryp-
tion/signature process.
