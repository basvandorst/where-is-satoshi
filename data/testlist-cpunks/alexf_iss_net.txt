The thing is that most people who are into this stuff would probably view VRML graphics as too primitive to hold their interest for the sake of "stimulation."  I would suspect that the people who would end up getting involved in putting Hillary/Evangelista in, ummm, compromising positions would probably do it for the humor value (not that the censor mongers won't have a fit over this anyway).  When your CPU becomes the bottleneck in net connections and not the actual bandwidth, *then* some people might decide to spend the time rendering such things.  However, w/ the state of things today I have yet to see a totally realistic looking rendering.  You can usually tell a photo from a rendering.
I suppose slander would be some recourse, or you could copyright your likeness and use copyright violations as well.  Many TV/Movie stars do this.

Easy enough.
This is probably yet another case of people not thinking ahead.  As usual.  People buying CDs at a garage sale & getting arrested for piracy.  Wonderful.
If they steal it, well, who cares?  If there is something worked out so that they could trace STOLEN (not traded or sold) CDs then fine, arrest them.  Do you really think though that anyone would waste so much time over $8?
Probably not done that way.  My guess is that the disk ID is assigned to the disk at the time of manufacturing.  At the point of purchase the customer is forced to give name, address, ID, whatever.  This is then stored in a database along with the disc ID (serial num) which is prolly printed in the ISBN number or cross referenced with that in a national database or something, or just printed right on the disc.  Anyway, a number is given to you from the CD, and not vice versa, I would imagine.
Actually, this would be quite easy.  The "watermark" would be a signal that plays inband, but out of our hearing range during the entire CD.  The human ear can only hear in the 20-20,000 (Hz, KHZ?, whatever) range.  It would be trivial to add a digital ID signal at, say 30,000 or 15 or something like that.  This could then be decoded, if need be.  This seems the easiest and most efficient way.  This could also be defeated with a lot of $$ (and/or a LOT of HD space).  If the frequecy is known (it can be found out) it can easily be run through recording studio eqipment that can very effectively isolate the frequency and cut it out.  If you have a LOT of HDD space (digital audio at 2 stereo tracks, not sure of the sampling rate or bit resolution, takes about 20MB of HDD space per minute (2 tracks, good sampling and bit rate) ) you could probably find the freq. fairly easily by isolation and just edit it out, and write the new stuff to a CD-R.  If the signal is purely digital, I would imagine that it might be even easier that if it were an analog signal (?).  Someone w/ good equipment (Digital Labs' stuff, or SAW (Software Audio Workshop) would be able to do this w/o much problem.  The question is is the price/effort worth it?  In quantity maybe.  On an individual basis, only if you already happen to have the erquipment.
I have a suspiscion that this type of thing will not really come to any kind of fruition due to not only the ability to defeat this, but mainly due to things like buying at a garage sale, etc.  If it did, only MASS market piraters would be investigated.  (Another example of a law creating it's own violators.  Don't make the law, there won't be mass piratingof "clean CDs"

Actually (speaking from personal experience) many many recordings are now done at a sampling rate of 48 instead of 44.1 (actually it may be around 50/50 or so, from my experience).  Many CD replicators these days are thrilled to get recordings done at 48 instead of 44.1, which gives even more room.
Another possibility, if you want to get even more into detail is to encode the ID in digital format on the CD.  This will give an audible sound (ever put a CD-Rom in a regular CD player by mistake?), but a mirror of that sound played at the same time will effectively set that sound to nothing (cancelling it out).  You can't hear it, but a machine can still decode the digital info.  This way you can set it at a higher frequency where if it happens to cancell out a brief second of music, the listener won't notice (unless you are "Jamie Summers" :)  ).

Actually I was thinking more along the lines of physically stealing, but if someone sniffed an electronic transfer of a record then the laws would become even more useless as far as enforcement goes.
Considering that their sources are probably more reliable (even though less knowledgable), and considering the idiocy of such an idea, I would risk saying that they are right :)
There are solutions to this that work.
1) The Greatful Dead approach - let everyone bootleg live shows.  Who 2) The Frank Zappa Approach - take the bootlegged copies, use better equipment, and possibly your own soundboard recordings of the same show, and put them out yourself.  Since you are capable of putting out a better product sonically, then beat them at their own game ("Beat the Boots")

Never said that it would be fool proof :)
Sometimes with good reason, just like software producers are paraniod about piracy.  Though, the Ent. Ind. does tend to overreact.  IMO the copyright laws that are currently in place are enough to protect against the forms of piracy that they are trying to protect themselves against.  I really don't  think that there is need for new legislation or potentially privacy invading practices at this point.  The forgers of the copyright laws (at least as they relate to music) had incredible foresight.  Basically, from the laws that were originally drafted (30's maybe?  Then revised in the early '70's at least as far as public domain goes) both videos and CDs are protected.  These were written when there were no CDs or videos.
The Ent. Ind. got what they wanted though.  There are taxes, etc. (some sort of import restrictions anyway) that keep DAT player/recorder devices at around $700 per unit.  By this time normally the prices *should* be down to like $200 (using the CD industry as a guide)
DATs are used all over the industry because they are cheap (see below), and because going from analog tape to DAT for CD mastering is a million times easier then sending off reels of analog tape, even if the tape is a properly mixed down duplicate of the master.  There are still track times, numbers, etc., etc.  A HUGE pain in the ass for CD manufacturers, but easy to do on a one-off basis in the studio where the producer & artist can sit there and help mix, fix tracks, select times, indexes, etc., etc.  It can all be done to a single DAT )(which would then be copied for safety) and set along with a time code sheet.
Cover art is pretty easy to duplicate if you have access to a color laser printer.  Just scan the original in at 300dpi, and print it out at the same resolution/size and you have it.  Just don't scan it in as a .GIF :) (too few colors)
You would run into the same problems if it were done by CC.  Hopefully the industry will do some sort of a cost-analysis (an accurate one) and realize that they would spend more on this than they lose (esp. since they still wouldn't eliminate piracy, just make it a little more difficult).
Yes, that's true.  Anyone ever hear of HAARP?  :)  Certain frequencies can affect the brain in certain ways (a guy by the name of Robert A Monroe, while maybe a little eccentric, has been using this method since the 50's to do things like keep people awake when they are sleepy, vice versa, etc.).  Also the body.  Your body parts resonate a certain frequencies.  For example, there is a very low note (I believe that it is a B) that vibrates at the same frequency as your bowels.  Play that note, and you loose control... :) (If anyone knows this frequency, PLEASE let me know.  I'm serious :) ).
 This is the reason I touched on that in my other posting.  The real difference between analog vs. digital is actually 2 things; static and musical "overtones" (used to produce various distortion effects and feedback, for example.  ANyone who has listened to Robin Trower, Hendrix, Van Halen, etc. knows).
People *are* playing with these frequencies.  It's known as COSM or Composite Object Sound Modeling, and apparently is fuzzier (as in fuzzy logic, not fuzzy sound) than cold sampling is.  Companies like Roland and Line6 are playing with such things.  Roland is really doing some amazing things with this technology.
Yeah, that's something else too.  I'm not sure exactly how that works, but I *think* it's like a 1Khz or 1 hz signal that signals this.  At least it is for the start of the first track on a cd.  In the manufacturing process, at least
The thing is, there is no money lost, really.  Think about it.  In order for one CD to be bought at a garage sale, someone else had to buy it at a retail store.  If the record companies were in the used CD business then there may be money lost, but otherwise.  The place where real money is lost is sale of promo CDs (many say "Promotional copy.  Not for sale" on them).  Here the record company loses nothing.  The artist loses big time.  With the exception of Sony records, most record companies will only pay artists royalties on 85% of records sold.  The other 15% is said to be "promotional material" which is a huge scam run by the recording industry to take advantage of the artists.  These 15% are still paid for (manufacturing, etc.) by the artist, and are given away to radio stations, etc.  There is where the real money is lost.  The rest is lieing with numbers.

Yes, but concievably if (whoever would be incharge, FBI?) *could*, under law do this, even if they are wrong.  It is a lot harder to prove that they intentionally harrassed *you* than it is for them to say that they were following leads and show evidence.  Yes, this may never happen, but the mere fact that it *could* is uncomforting.  Kinda like the CDA an Clinton saying "we will not enforce this...."  Fine, but there is still a law on the books that allows them to if they decide to change their mind.  Even if you can't be found guilty, you could still be ruined by legal fees, job loss, etc.
Don't wanna end up on that "Group-W" bench!  :)
Cds are often sampled at 48 these days.  Mine was, and we had to reduce it to 44.1 for mass producing (much to our surprise, since many CD manufacturers love getting stuff at 48 over 44.1)

This is such crap, and I'll tell you why.  It is a classic example of political double speak.  Here Hillary says that children are in danger because of lost family values.  Absolutely true.  Let me ask you then why is it that Bill(ary) signed an unconstitutional law?  I am referring to the CDA and the telephony bill.  What about the terrorism bill?  They apparently support censorship on the Internet.  They don't want "bigtitties.gif" on the net and accessable to little Johnny.  They say that it is WRONG for little Johhny to have access to "bigtitties.gif," and that the GOVERNMENT should DO SOMETHING about this.  What happened to family values?  Just HOW the hell can you support and promote family values when you are telling the parents (who you want to pay more attention to their children, get more involved, and be kinder) "WE know what is best for little Johnny, and WE will make the decisions, NOT YOU"  To me this sends a message of "The government knows best because most parents are stupid and uncaring."  It is much more likely that little Johnny will go over to Sammy's house and look at the Playboys that Sammy's dad has hidden under the bed than collect nudie .gifs off of the net, but they wouldn't dare censor that.  The Internet is another story, however.  I got news for them, we had pornography LONG before the net ever existed, and there is NO solid psychological link to viewing porn and becoming a sex offender.  Anyone who thinks so needs to realize that they are talking about something about which they have no clue.

The likelyness is irrelevant to the point.  Possibility is relevant.  Probability is not.
Does that really matter? .  In REALITY, it will never be enforced.  So what?  The potential is still there, and in essence, that is ALL that matters!  The discussion of "in theory...." doesn't neglect the realities of the legal system, rather it highlights the POTENTIAL for abuse.  Even if the law is never enforced, could it not be used as an example to justify other laws that *may* be introduced?  Does it not set a dangerous precedent?    We are talking about dangerous empowerment  here.
Hmm. The arguement "well, we would never REALLY enforce it" just doesn't hold water with me, and makes me uncomfortable.
A defense would be easy, fine.  But it would still cost $$$.  Do you see what I am getting at?  This is done ALL THE TIME (no, not at pawn brokers.  I'm talking about taking advantage of either cost or time to get what you want).
That's not the point.  What we are talking about here is a covert channel.  Whether it is at 30KHZ, 22KHz or right in the middle of the audible range.  Mine was ONE proposal, a theory of sorts, thought up off of the top of my head as a possible way of doing this.  You can also add a digital serial number right in the audible range, if you like.  Static that is recorded along with analog sound is at certain frequency ranges, typically.  When you have a disk that holds 640Mb or so the serial number's size is trivial in comparison.  Sending the whole number at once will barely be audible even if in a good frequency range simply because of speed.  If you send it in bits and pieces during the song, and furthermore record this data in the middle of the frequency range where static is located, you won't hear it anyway.  However certain devices will be able to read the data w/o Similarly, you have a CD, let's say Beethoven's 9th symphony.  You have ~640 MB on the CD.  If you want to sneak someone an encrypted message, say a top secret document and it is compressed down to 1K, then putting this into the audio signal as described above is fairly trivial.  The other end doesn't even need to know bit counts.  The document can be spreadout, reversed, whatever and just signaled w/ a flag (much like PPP and other protocols).  All the other end needs to decode is a flag at a set frequency range, both of which can be constantly changed. Alex F

The real; answer to all of these points is too simple.  "Because they can"
A lot has to do with percieved value.  If consumers would have thought that the prices were way too high, then the market would have dictated a lower cost eventually.  I think that the price of CDs vs tapes is more a marketing issue than a technical one....

I disagree.  The CDA is not likely to ever get enforced.  Does this mean that we should just ignore it because likeliness is zero to Uhh, if the DA has a personal vendetta against the guy w/ the bike he *COULD* charge him, if he wanted to, and it would be 100% legal.  What we are talking about here are laws that allow for harrassment under the guise of the legal system.  Granted, laws are not necedssarily bad, people are, but still....
This stuff CAN and DOES (there goes the "likeliness" theory) happen all the time.
Your point of view strikes as one from a text book where people are not crooked (nothing wrong w/ that), but the sad fact is that there are people out there who can and will take advantage of any legal loophole in order to get done what they want done.

of the NSA Web server but no hard evidence. The claim made is
that several Mb of files were downloaded from the server and

files in question were not considered sensitive - and there is
no reason to believe that the NSA would be keeing anything
secret on their Web server.
*if* the page was hacked indeed, then I seriously doubt that files of any significance were taken.  I would think that they would not keep any classified info on a web server (!).  If someone hacked into the page, got the files, and then posted them to the internet they probably would *not* have posted these to sci.crypt, etc. (I like the addition of alt.conspiracy though).  My guess is that they would end up on a private mailing list, or end up getting posted to one of the "warez" groups or something.
If this were true, I would be interested to know just what it was that they were keeping on their website and why.  Could they be trojaned files?  Would the NSA go to so much trouble when there are easier ways of doing things?  Just curious about this....
