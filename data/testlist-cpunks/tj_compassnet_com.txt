This is true.  IMNSHO we are witnessing yet another case of the representation of an illegitimate constituency.  Grassley is not representing the people of his state -- he is representing and carrying water for federal government interests.  While some people used to acidly refer to "The Senator from Texaco" and such, it is a much more common situation that some Senators and Representatives represent federal agencies in matters before their chamber that virtually NO VOTER would ever think of or could even discover as a matter of personal interest.  You can be sure Cathy Cornflower of Cherokee didn't start this by writing Grassley and suggesting that RICO be expanded to cover distribution of non-GAK crypto.  It is inconceivable that more than a tiny handful of Grassley's constituents would even recognize anything in his bill if stopped on the street and asked about it.
Agencies develop "friendly" congresscritters like the Soviets used to develop "friendly" journalists and politicos.  It wouldn't even be all that surprising if similar methods are used.  The "friendlies" take obscure and no-so-obscure issues before their house on behalf of the agencies.  At some level this is probably necessary, but with all those folks getting comfy with each other up there in Disneyland-on-the-Potomac, it's impossible that unholy alliances do not develop.  The "us vs them" mentality of a congresscritter grows to encompass all three branches under "us" and views the unwashed masses as "them."  In that view the suit from XYZ who comes over to confer with the staffers is "one of us."  He gets right in (while visiting constituents wait stupidly for an appointment that the elected official will be -- we're so sorry -- unable to keep).  He's bringing up an issue of concern to "us."  "We" have a problem that needs to be fixed by modifying para (a) of sec (3) to read "shall" instead of "may."  "We" will feel very important and may even win some special stroking or quid pro quo for fixing "our" problem.
The one real flaw in this is that the electorate was just left out of the loop, and kept in the dark to boot.  When the elected official went into "we" mode he ceased representing the people who sent him there.  In these increasingly totalitarian times it's likely his representation was distinctly CONTRARY to the interest of those who sent him there.
There have been cases of agencies approaching "their" congressman and having completely new language inserted in a conference bill -- language that was never in the original, never offered as an amendment until the bill from each house went to conference, and never debated when the conformed bills returned for final vote.  It's the norm that such maneuvers go completely unreported in the media.
There is also something that is almost always overlooked... taking names.  It is possible to "pull on the string" and follow the visible event back to the less immediately visible actors.  The congresscritters, though by and large harried and ignorant, are not always guiltless.  At best they are willing agents for little bits and pieces of the fabric of overweening statism.  In every case, though, there are faceless staffers who may also be harried but are usually NOT ignorant.  The staffers are often the ones who "sell" the congresscritter on signing onto this or that non-voter issue for this or that self-serving political reason.  Staffers also include the people with huge political axes to grind -- people who gravitate to the positions of writing the text of the bills that translate the generality to which the elected official has acceded into excruciatingly detailed and usually confusing legislative language.
There's a relatively small number of really activist people in government, and not all of them are public and visible.  It's possible that some congresscritters could be defeated with the aid of dissemination back home of information on the non-voter issues they've championed and concise explanations of how many of those issues work to harm their voters.  It's also possible that some of those faceless staffers could be turned into liabilities by focusing some light on them, thereby reducing their effectiveness and employability.
It would seem that the U.S. may lose a number of good minds who may prefer to live and write code in other parts of the world.  This has been a developing trend for other reasons, and now people who like to write crypto will have another reason to look for a new home.
Name a good one!
Your urging is appropriate.  It's odd, though, how the country seems to be pulling itself in two diametrically opposed directions:  On the one hand the electorate shifted significantly in the '94 election, responding with greater enthusiasm than even the new young Turks in Congress seem to fully comprehend, and seeming to be fed up with too much government, prepared to commission the dismantling of federal bureaucracy and getting government the hell out of their lives.  On the other hand we see bold and impressive moves on the part of politicos and bureaucrats toward a suffocating, draconian 1984 police state.  We have even heard increasing choruses of "Just following orders" and "Just doing my job" from mindless hatchetmen these last few decades -- bizarre and incredible echos of the excuses offered in post-WWII war crimes defenses.
The country cannot move strongly in these two directions for long: Something has to give.  The longer this division persists, the greater the gulf that stretches between and the more "interesting" the times that will result when one side prevails.  The side that prevails will consume the side that fails with an intensity related to the energy built up in the process.
Crypto is presently on the periphery of the larger schism, though it's conceivable that twenty years in the future it would be clearly understood by most people to be central to privacy in an information age.  The moves to head crypto, and thus privacy, off at the pass are being made now, though, in an effort to prevent a future in which large numbers of people understand how to maintain privacy when everything is a bit stream. If there is a critical and unique difference between this and other seemingly similar situations it is the 10-15% monthly growth of the Internet, something that is orders of magnitude greater than what humans are accustomed to perceiving, estimating, handling, coping with.  If recent figures are accurate, 7,500+ new web pages have been created in the 33 hours since this thread started here and perhaps 100,000 new people are on the net in one way or another.  It's unlikely that Grassley or Exon or Leahy can assimilate all the implications of that rate of growth.  "Senator, the blob is at the door!"  "Well, call the State Police!"  "Uh, sir, they're at least three hours away.  In that time the blob will be larger than the State of Idaho!"  The politicos have never before dealt with a sizable "throwaway minority" whose current growth curve intersects the U.S. population curve in 24 months and the world population curve in 4 years.  In a couple of days there are more new people getting on the net worldwide than are contained in a U.S. congressional district.  Partly as a result, there are issues getting attention that would have easily been contained just a couple of years ago by the policy of benignly overlooking them.  No longer.  If a net mobilization was disappointing last month, try it this month and see the difference.  Movements that took years to form and grow decades ago take days or weeks now.  Soon they will take only hours.  We are just now cresting the big one on the supercharged roller coaster of high tech infoplosion, and as the velocity rapidly builds there will be profound shock among the old and the slow.  Even the savvy will be surprised. Push this medium for all it's worth.  Find ways to promote informed privacy as a ground-floor issue for newbies and get them to have a knowledgable, vested interest in it.  Get people onto the net.  One new person today is four or five people a year from now, 15-28 people two years from now.  Since a lot of it spreads from person to person, new people start with tools and concepts they get from others, so the initiation of a new netparticipant as a privacy-aware crypto user tends to spawn subtrees of new users in the same mode.  Use the growth multiplier to outflank 'em while they're noodling.
Would it be more productive to hire the white shoes or start another few ISPs and shepherd the new users to be privacy-aware letter writers and faxers?  Educate your ISPs.  Any ISP that isn't political in this age is brain dead and dead weight.  Any ISP that sees its political interests as somehow different than those of its users (recent lobbying to shift burdens away from national services and onto users, and recent AOL admissions of participation in what sounded like entrapping users) is worse than brain dead

I had thought to respond similarly when I first saw this unixcentric I have to take issue with this, though:
The point *is* legitimate.  I disagree that PC users won't be in the vanguard of anything:  PC users *are* the market now (gag me with a TSR).  A nifty program for PC will be in use by millions in a *very* short time, while a similar program for unix will not even be visible to the larger market.  If PGP had been limited to the unix market, few people would know of it today.  Frankly, the PC folks don't give a rat's ass what unix folks do.  Watch the production and sales numbers for Windows 95 and gasp.  For better or worse, that is the market, and that is where the bucks are to pay for connectivity, memory, disk, and... software.
I certainly don't want to bash unix, but I can't help but think that one's viewpoint of what's going on "out there" is strongly affected by the encapsulated universes we create for ourselves.  If you like to run unix but hooked into it from another PC running TCP/IP under Windows, you'd see what the vast majority of new users see -- no command line, no need to deal with a 30 year old user interface (send flames to useless.arguments at blackhole.net). Does that matter much?  ISPs are proliferating like mushrooms, and the users hooking up to them have PCs and Macs.  Users connect by PPP or SLIP and use mail and www clients.  The user interface therefore has nothing to do with the connectivity or host OS.  Most of them *never* telnet, and only some of them ftp to install web pages.  Also, more and more people who connect to internet go *through* no ISP server at all.  A modem controller at the ISP prompts for userid and password, then connects them to an interface that takes them to a router.  Their packets flit over to the name server or out on the T1 as required, their traffic untouched by unix or any other OS.  An ISDN connection comes in on the same T1 that will carry most of its packets back out to the world, with a connection manager and router being the closest things to computers involved in the process.  At the far end of the net a server running who-cares-which-
OS handles the client's traffic and responds to it by standards that are thoroughly OS-independent.
I respectfully submit that improvements of user interface and tinker toy integration and development of new tools must be aimed at Windows / OS/2 / Mac System to have major impact, and at unix as a convenience to the important academic and other communities that work more directly with the unix user interfaces.  Academic and scientific users may make the bulk of thoughtful contribution in many areas, but that's like server push -- if there's no client, nothing happens.

Reading this thread it suddenly became clear:
-The appearance of a letter being handwritten is a temporary factor at best.
  Within a very few years (2-3 I would guess) the growth in the use of email and the volume of communications to be sorted into For and Against piles will cause a sudden and dramatic shift in Congress to a strong preference for incoming email.  Within 10 years they may refuse paper mail.  Any month now someone in Congress will tip to the fact that email can be processed by programs that can identify the issue and the pro or con position of the writer.  Constituents will be encouraged to write, but only in the form of email, and to state their position clearly and concisely, i.e. in a form suitable for successful parsing, analysis, and classification.
-Political letter renderers will become common on the Web before Nov. 1996.
  There are already renderers of graphic images on the Web.  There would be more if it were easy to pay with a 25-cent token, and it *will* be widespread and easy to do that, very very soon.  Political letter renderers don't have to wait for mass participation in online payment mechanisms -- they have ready-made sponsors.  Unlike the occasional effort to sponsor phone calls by making an 800 number available, sponsors of letter rendering services can be sure those services won't be seriously misused:  The 2nd Amendment CongressLetter WebPage will *only* render letters *against* H-1234 or *for* S-2345, for example.  The Tree Hugger CongressLetter WebPage (no trees died for this Page) will *only* render letters *against* H-9876, etc. etc.  Each will return the result of the rendering to you at your email address if you don't want to copy it off the web page.  *You* will send the email to your The process will be easy:  Right now any decent programmer could write code to allow choices from Column A, B, etc. to generate a plausible letter.  Generalized, this will allow the operators to create templates for each new issue, untouched by programmer hands.  Enhancements will make style, grammar, spelling, punctuation variations increasingly sophisticated.
-Rendering services will push email over into reality for Congress.
  Strangely, though the rendered letter is in large part a fabrication, it will be this ersatz form of personal communication that will finally force Congress to accept the reality of email.  Even though generated by computer, the rendered letter will still be an expression of a constituent's opinion on an issue.  It will rapidly become the preferred method of expression for many people who simply don't have time to make a career out of writing to -Congress will respond with automated mail tallying.
  Whatever chance there is that your present handwritten letter may actually be *read* will vanish completely in the age of email.  Your letter will be eaten by an analyzer, acknowledged by an intelligent renderer that may even refer to passages in your letter (and may even SEEM TO AGREE WITH YOU), and then be trashed.  Letters may be sidetracked if they contain certain unacceptable things, because the suits have to be kept busy, but most incoming mail will vanish after tallying.  -There could be "agent" wars, but they will not be of consequence.
  In the beginning, the politicos may wish to commission software enhancements and intelligence gathering to enable mail scanning agents to filter out email generated by letter renderers.  Developers of the analysis software may try to find vocabulary and phraseology patterns with which to arm the analysis agents to toss rendered letters aside.    In the end, though, this will be a losing battle and a counterproductive one.  If 50 million rendered letters come in from 50 million real voters, they had better *not* be ignored or 50 million voters will take vengeance at the polls.  An expression of opinion is an expression of opinion, and the sophistication of the tools employed to generate them will be able to stay ahead of the technology for detecting them in any case.
-Interaction with Congress may ultimately take the form of battling proxies.
  On the one side are arrayed the forces of the A party, the shining letter rendering algorithms, vocab lists, grammar rules, and the latest in provably accurate slang and misuse of the language.  On the other side, the forces of the B party, with essentially similar tools.  In the middle is Congress, gleaming mail analyzers polished and ready.    Strangest of all is that all the effort of rendering and analyzing letters will go into the creation and consumption of communication particles that may eventually never be seen by "author" *or* "recipient."  The electorate will express itself by proxy and the elected officials will divine the political winds by proxy.  Voters will be hard-sold to sign up for ongoing personally authorized letter rendering, so they can go fishing.  Congresscritters will be assured that the analyzers will figure out which way the winds are blowing, so they can go fishing.  May the best proxy win.    Maybe voter and congresscritter will meet somewhere, fishing, and actually *communicate*.  Perish the thought!
There has been a BBS "door" available for several years that does this convincingly... if you're a sysop and run a "sysop chat" door but want to play mind games when you're not available, SHAMPAGE will answer the user's request to page the sysop and chat with him or her.  It is configurable to recognize keywords and make random selections from lists of responses to those keywords.  It converses believably as if it were a somewhat distracted, tired and disjoint human being.
I saw a log of a SHAMPAGE session in which a caller never realized he was conversing with a robot.  It kept calling attention to the late hour and the caller kept apologizing for the intrusion and asking for a file he needed.  As luck would have it, the random utterings and random selections of responses to keywords were often right on the mark.  Too weird! After several hundred lines of chat the caller finally gathered that the "sysop" was really pissed at being kept up so late and logged off, somewhat offended himself.  SHAMPAGE typed in real time, with humanlike varying inter-keystroke timing, and makes "typos."  It "noticed" its mistakes a few keystrokes later and backspaced to correct them.  It typed "hte" instead of "the" and "ign" instead of "ing."  It was a riot.  With some enhancement it would be completely believable even to the forewarned caller.
I've also seen an incomplete attempt to bring the ELIZA concept up to date and implement it as a BBS door.  Though it typed line-at-a-time like a BBS teleconference, it still managed to confuse callers into thinking it was a real person by simple tricks of inverting pronouns and such.  It, like the chat door, seemed to be uncanny at randomly choosing just the right thing to say to cinch the caller's presumption that it was a human being.

Which of the following is the cleartext?
1. Bit and byte dropout can significantly impede communication.
2. Flower and shrub planting can greatly enhance landscaping.
3. Word and phrase substitution can hopelessly disguise meaning.
4. UFO and space-alien belief can seriously damage credibility.
If you *presume* my context, you easily identify (3).  If only the wordlists that translate between (1), (2) and (4) were available for your inspection, you would be up the creek but you wouldn't know it.
Yes, this is aba's "exxon" at work again, and yes, it seems to me that deniability through other-plausible-meaning is viable as a form of stego.  Grammatical correctness is easy to maintain, and care in choosing words can preserve much apparent meaning.

Thank you.  I would never have suspected.  I grew up in Heinlein's barrel, fed through a hole in the side, until I was 18.
(shrug).  The point is not whether people have used this before, or how cute the anecdotes of wartime failures or detections.  The point is that everyone uses language in innumerable explainable contexts, and that we have computers with which to effortlessly transform text into other text.  There is no need to knit, or invent crossword matrices, concoct drawings, or fabricate verifiable sports statistics.  With word substitution, anything can mean anything.  I never suggested it take the place of encryption, or that I thought it a new form of stego.  The implications may be new in the context of ubiquitous high-speed computers and electronic communication, in that the evidentiary value of written language can be shown to be so malleable as to be useless.  For example, how would you like to have to ascribe particular meaning to the accumulated notes and files of someone who collects "exxon" wordlists?  Virtually anything you process against any of the wordlists will change into something equally as interesting (or uninteresting) as the original.  The presence in a system of wordlists tends to reduce the content of natural language files in that system to examples of sentence structure.  As an example of just how malleable sentence structure templates can be, the defense in such a case might convert the prosecution's charging document into a glowing commendation of the defendant, suitably introduced through an expert witness.

The owner of the key being cracked jumps in and "randomly" selects the part of the keyspace containing the key, then reports back in the negative.
This defense of the key is reduced if the server doles out pieces of the keyspace randomly, selected only for size, and further reduced if the same space is given out multiple times to different requestors.
