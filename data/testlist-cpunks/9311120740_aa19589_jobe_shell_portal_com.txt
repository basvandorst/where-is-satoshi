Yeah, but how much data?  Just because something can be solved given
enough data doesn't help me break it if I need 10^37643254 bytes of data
to do it.
Well, here's a little test.  The following numbers were generated using
a chaotic function:
Do you see a pattern?  What function did I use to generate it?  :)
(Actually, assuming you knew what function I used, you could probably
solve for the key if you had enuf raw output from the PRNG, so it's
probably not completely impossible to solve the above, but that wouldn't
necessarily help you decrypt a file which had been encoded with such a
pad, unless you knew a lot about the format of the file.)
