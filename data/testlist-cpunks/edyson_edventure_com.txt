Before going into the merits of this, let me make two points: One I specifically asked the reporter (Amy Harmon) to quote me as an
individual, not as a spokesperson for the EFF.  (It was Amy Harmon, and the
only address I have for her bounces, but as you can imagine I would like to
get in touch with her!  Anyone know it?)  These are my personal views; EFF
has no formal policy on this yet -- precisely because it's a complex issue.
Now, speaking personally: I believe there are trade-offs -- which is what I
told the LA Times.  I assume I was quoted accurately (although the word
"enforce" is awkward), but out of context.   Anonymity can be dangerous --
as can traceability, especially in/by repressive regimes.  Therefore I would
favor allowing anonymity -- with some form of traceability only under terms
considerably stronger than what are generally required for a wiretap.
Anyone who seriously needs anonymity because of a repressive government is
likely to use a foreign (outside whatever jurisdiction he fears) server, so
that this is not a matter of "local" laws.  The tracer would have to pass
through what I hope would be tighter hoops than we have now.  Please note that this is not the same as the right to *private*
conversations and the use of encryption; this is the issue of being
accountable for what you publish in public.  My assumption is that there will be a wide variety of Net communities with
different rules/regulations/attitudes towards anonymity that would apply ex
some kind of international sanctions; I think that's appropriate.  Yes, I'm aware of the complexities, and of the possibilities for
miscarriages of justice.  The world isn't yet the way I want it to be.  But
I wanted to respond reasonably promptly.  BTW, I would welcome a chance to read the whole article (or at least a
*little* more of the context, under fair use).
Speaking for myself, only (and publicly),

At least you don't accuse me of being a Communist.  For the record, I am not
a tool of the CIA nor have they pressured me, but there's no reason for you
to believe me.  Esther Dyson SNIP ---

FWIW, I'm still collecting some thoughts, because this is a complex topic
(as you all know), and I'm tired of having my views misinterpreted and
misattributed.  So I want to state them clearly and carefully.  This is
simply a reaction to one item. Please note the quote marks carefully.  I said [something like] the first
paragraph, but the rest is the "reporter" from Scientology, plus a paraphrase.
