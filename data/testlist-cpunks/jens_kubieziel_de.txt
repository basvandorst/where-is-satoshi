Some years ago Felix von Leitner had a look at GnuPG. His findings were
quite disappointing (). However
now all things were quietly fixed. My impression from the episode is
that GnuPG needs a proper review. Maybe it has more bugs inside.
See  for Felix'
comment (in german).

Our local hackerspace uses a rather neutral address:
We could also host the Cypherpunks list, if you like. However here is no
Majordomo running (and probably never will be). As far as I see it the
list doesn't use the distributed feature, so switching to Mailman should
not be a hard problem.
If you like a more on topic domain I could setup a mailing list at
anonymitaet-im-inter.net. ;) This is german for ;anonymity on the
internet+. The site hosts at the moment only a Mixmaster node.
