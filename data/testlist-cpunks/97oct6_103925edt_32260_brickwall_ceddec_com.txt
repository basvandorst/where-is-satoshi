@_subject: The Child Molester Prevention and Effective Sentencing Act 
I remember one of the NET moderators asked why they should use encryption.
What if you want to send a message to your child saying you will be late
after school.  What is to prevent a pedophile from forging such a message?
And if a pedophile intercepts such a message, couldn't he arrive 5 minutes
early saying that "dad changed his plans again and sent me...".
Now, Rep. Tauzin wants to make it illegal to listen in to any "private" radio communication (yes listen, not just repeat), since Gingrich couldn't
have access to encrypted communication and someone listened in on his cell
phone.  One law prevents security from being available, so they think that
a second law will prevent people from listening in.
Repealing a law preventing fences is more effective than adding a
draconian penalty for tresspass. --- reply to tzeruch - at - ceddec - dot - com ---
