Actually, the transport layer *is* to blame.  I don't know how much more
clear I can be about it.  Because Tor users are almost universally bad,
because almost no good edits come out of the Tor network, we block them.
Why is it that Tor users are so bad?  The main reason is that the
anonymity provides them with cover.
AOL users are sort of bad, but not universally bad.  Why is that?  It is
in part because of the way their transport layer is designed.
We *do* realize that.  That's exactly what I'm talking about.  Tor
provides an avenue for action without responsibility, and people do use it.
If what you're saying is "I think it is fine for Wikipedia to block
Tor," then you really aren't contributing productively to this
conversation.  There are some facts we know: we can usefully reduce the
amount of anonymous grief we get by blocking Tor exit servers.  So, this
is what we are currently doing.  I consider this unfortunate, but there
you go.
We are not looking for a perfect solution.  Yes, Wikis will be
vandalized.  We're prepared to deal with that, we do deal with that.
But what I am seeking is some efforts to think usefully about how to
helpfully reconcile our dual goals of openness and privacy.
I don't say "privacy is wrong, so Tor should change their philosophy".
I make no apologies for simply ignoring you if you say that "openness is
wrong, so Wikipedia should change their philosophy."
What is it that we don't get?  This thread started off because a Tor
server complained to me about the blocking, and part of my response is
that one beef I have is that some people in the Tor community seem very
happy to simply stick their heads in the sand and pretend that
"Wikipedians don't get it".
That's not helpful.

Yes, we can lay moral blame on the bad actors.  That's fine.  Let's all
stop typing for a minute or two and just _hate_ them for it.  Ok, now we
all feel better. :-)
But now we're back to the question: how can Tor be improved to deal with
this very serious and important problem?  What are the steps that might
be taken, however imperfect, to reduce the amount of abuse coming from
Tor nodes?

This is exactly the right approach!
I would say that even some fairly slight changes to the incentive
structure may help a lot.  The less desirable Tor is for problem users,
the more they will shift to traditional broken open proxies.  We can
play whack-a-mole with these as we do now, while at the same time
leaving Tor more open.
Yes, but I don't really mind them moving to other avenues.  That's the
point.  If I didn't love Tor, I wouldn't care about blocking Tor either.
 Let them abuse broken proxy servers, let them do whatever, that's fine,
we can deal with it.  We just want to open up to Tor.
Let me see if I can explain a bit more of the math behind this.  I'm
just going to make up a hypothetical example.
Suppose 100 out of every 1,000,000 edits to Wikipedia is malicious.  And
suppose we study them and discover, hmm, 25 of them come from Tor, which
is easily blockable.  50 of them come from static ips or dynamic ips
that are expensive for users to get new.  25 of them are from broken
Now, our present solution is to block Tor, do various things in other
situations, and this works reasonably well.  Of the 25 bad edits we
block from Tor, some portion of them surely shift to other means, but
not all of them.  So we find it to be a net win.
Except.  Except we don't really like to block Tor.
Now, fast forward, and imagine that the "expensive ip" situation goes
away in a few years, either due to widespread onion routing, or whatever
you may want to dream up that makes our temporary kludge of using ips no
longer functional.
Then we'll still only have 100 out of every 1,000,000 edits to Wikipedia
as being malicious.  How we'll deal with that is how we'll deal with
that, but that's fine.  We'll manage.
For now the key thing to do is to shift the incentives on the bad users
so that Tor is less desirable for them than playing with the broken
proxies or just doing whatever with a dialup account or aol addresses or

I do not use Tor, and so at risk of offending those who already think
that I "hate Tor", I will say that it has been said to me by some people
that we're lucky that Tor is horribly slow, or lots of people would use
it, making the problem much worse. :-)
The typical problem case, and I asked around for horror stories to
confirm my impression, is that some lunatic first starts writing at
Wikipedia in an incoherent, biased, offensive, etc. way.  The community
at first tries to work with them, because it does take a while to absorb
our peaceful ways if you're used to Usenet or mailing list debates.  But
eventually, the worst offenders end up getting blocked.
Then they go ballistic.  Imagining themselves to be el1t3 h4xx0rs, they
write (or find online somewhere) vandalbots and start using them to
replace pages with "fuck you" or goatse images or... well, there seems
to be no shortage of creativity in the world of the deranged and snubbed.
We don't sweat this too much.  We just block them and rever the changes.
 The problem is much worse for small wiki sites than it is for Wikipedia
because we're fully staffed by hundreds of smart people 24 hours a day.
 The people on the frontlines tell me this isn't such a huge problem,
because we do things to limit the abuse.
One of the things we currently do is block Tor.  I consider that a
reasonable solution to the vandalism problem, but an unfortunate thing,
since to my mind, Tor is something very good.
It would be nice if we could look at the edits coming from Tor and say
"Oh, these are fine, they are mostly responsible edits."  It'd even be
ok if we could look at the edits coming from Tor and say "Ok, so there's
a touch more vandalism from these than from other ip pools, but there's
also some good stuff coming through from places where we normally don't
see a lot of editing activity.  We'll put up with it."
As it is now, we look at it and say "oh, jesus".

That's right.  I'm not an expert in Tor-ish matters, and so despite my
strident manner at times, I am very happy to learn more and understand
why some initial suggestion I might have has already been considered and
rejected with good cause.
And as an ongoing gesture of goodwill, let me explain _why_ I want Tor
to be significantly less effective as a tool for Wikipedia abuse.  It
isn't because Tor is a threat to our work.  One of the nice things about
how Tor is implemented is that we can easily get a list of the exit
servers and block them.  Problem solved.
No, the reason I am interested in exploring possibilities for reducing
the abuse is not to protect wikipedia, but to make it possible for Tor's
goals to be achieved more effectively.
Yes.  The one thing I should caution against, though, is assuming that
the right solution to the problem should involve anything complicated on
the part of Wikipedia.  We're willing to do whatever, but I'm also
interested in how this problem can be solved more generally.  In this
way, tor servers can be allowed to post anonymously and in a hit-and-run
fashion to blogs, for example.

I have no opinion about HashCash just yet.  I have to think about it
some more.
The nefarious juveniles problem is partly what it is, yes.  But that
sort of random vandalism goes on all the time, and isn't particularly
What is problematic is the lunatic on crack and steriods who is
selectively posting "Kilroy sucked your mothers cock" graffiti,
obsessively, hundreds of times.  Our admins find it much more peaceful
to just block open proxies and Tor servers than to deal with that for
hours on end, days on end, weeks on end.
I am not an expert on ideas like HashCah or anything of the sort.  I am
a bit of an expert on the behavior of problem users at Wikipedia. :-)
And what I can say is that problem users at Wikipedia are problem users
everywhere for the most part.  Ordinary sane people don't go on a spree
of Wikipedia vandalism.
So the _degree_ of trust we need is actually quite small.  It isn't "We
certify this person to be a certain user, guaranteed, the same as ever".
It's just "this packet is being sent to you from a source that has
somehow tended generally to lead us to believe to some small extent that
the person posting it has not been a jackass, by and large".
Or, as has been brilliantly discussed here already, it could be "this
packet has been sent to you via a mechanism that one might bother to
use, were one a dissident really needing anonymity, but sufficiently
bothersome that were one simply a lunatic on crack, one would more
likely have simply switched to using anonymous proxies".
It won't be perfect, but as an empirical matter, it's probably good enough.

Well, at least with respect to Wikipedia there are a few misconceptions
I should clear up.  First, something like that wouldn't be appropriate
for Wikipedia on editorial grounds.  ("No original research") -- we have
specific intellectual standards that would generally preclude that sort
of thing.
Second, 'moderation' at wikipedia is reactive.  That is, people
vandalize, and then we clean it up.
Well, it seems unlikely that we could recruit enough people to do this
effectively.  We already have a huge number of people monitoring the
site, people who are (mostly) sympathetic to Tor's aims, but they get
tired of it.
