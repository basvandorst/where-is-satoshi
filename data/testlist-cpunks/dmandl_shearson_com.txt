@_subject: Interview with Tim May on WFMU 
For interested cypherpunks (or anyone else) in the NYC area, I'm going
to be interviewing Tim May on my radio show this Saturday.  The show's
on WFMU (East Orange, NJ), 91.1 FM, from noon-3:00.  Tim'll be on starting
at 2 PM.

Yipes.  I got a whole bunch of (advance) requests for tapes of the
interview, so I'm posting this to the group to make things a bit
easier for myself...
I'll be more than happy to send copies to anyone for the cost
of postage and the blank tape.  I'll also be sending a copy to
Tim, so if it's easier, you can try to get him to dupe it for you.
Of course, being a worrywart, I'll hold off until Monday to confirm
that the thing went off without a hitch.  I'll post to the group
then and let you know.

OK, folks, the interview went off beautifully (thanks Tim).
As mentioned earlier, if anyone wants a copy of the tape,
I'll be happy to send one.  Unfortunately, I'm going to be
a little slow making copies because my cassette deck is crippled at the moment, so be patient.  Email me if you're
** Important request: Is there a kind soul out there who would
be willing to transcribe the interview (~40 minutes total)???
I just don't have the time.  If you can do it, I will mail you a copy of the tape gratis (total value: $1.50 + postage!).

No.  It's called "The Hacker's Quarterly" and never claims to be anything
else.  Eric Corley (editor/publisher) is completely above-ground.  He
even does a computer show on WBAI here in New York, though I haven't heard
it.  In fact, he was on MY radio show (WFMU) a few years ago talking
about hackers.  I was initially surprised that he was willing to use
his real name on the show; I ended up being almost disappointed by how "apolitical" he seemed.  2600 prints plenty of articles by flamboyant
young pranksters on how to break into this or that system, but rather
than an editorial line or policy, this is more a result of 2600's view
that all this information should be available and uncensored.  These are
the kinds of guys who uncover holes in multinationals' computer security
and TELL THEM about it.  (BTW, I'm not involved with the magazine in any
way; in fact, I find most of its articles kinda uninspiring or mundane.)

@_subject: Phil Zimmerman on the Radio 
FYI, for those of you in the NYC area, I'm going to be conducting a
brief interview with Phil Zimmerman (author of PGP) on my radio show
tomorrow to discuss the recent NSA/Big Brother crypto developments
(see the front page of today's New York Times).
WFMU, East Orange, NJ, 91.1 FM.  My show airs from noon-3:00 local time,
and the interview will start at around 1:00.
N.B.: I will NOT be taping the show, so I can't make tapes for anyone.
Anyone else listening is free to make copies and do whatever they want
with them, of course.
   --Dave.

Perry, I'm absolutely stunned.  What next: should we all make sure we shave
every day (women: don't forget those legs and armpits!)?  Or make tcmay remove
the word "anarchy" and other ungood words from his .sig?  Anyone who feels
like talking to the press or lobbying her representatives (and I'm not
claiming that those tactics are either good or bad) can wear a suit, makeup,
a respectable haircut, or whatever--that's their decision.  I can understand
the need to confront this issue as a large and united group, and I suspect that
other groups like the EFF, CPSR, etc., are better for that purpose anyway.  You
don't need to mention that you're a "cypherpunk" when dealing with media or
government officials if you think that'll diminish your credibility or legitimacy.
It's easy to be idealistic when things are good.  At the _very first hint_ of trouble,
we shouldn't immediately cower and go straight (this may seem like an exaggeration,
but the name-change proposal strikes me as a dangerous first step).  Shit, we're not
even doing anything _illegal_.  Relax.
Love and Kisses,
   --Dave.

@_subject: Trapdoors 
You may be right.  For example, I know for a fact that all 386/486
chips trap files with the string "Liz" in them--this is so that the
NSA can capture and read love letters from me to my girlfriend.  I
have been getting around this by changing my pet names for her
constantly, and placing the string "Liz" at random points in massive
junk files to waste the spooks' disk space.  Inconvenient, but it
works.  Ciao.

Yup, there are dozens of reasons to want anonymity.  This should be completely
obvious to anyone moving in cypherpunk circles--or alt.sex circles, where,
amazingly, some well-respected sexosophists actually spoke out against anonymous
posting recently.  No offense intended, but anyone who can't think of situations
where anonymity is essential should get out more.  Any first grader can list
dozens of places where even mild blasphemy will get you locked up for a long
time. [Begin Zerowork tangent] And even if you think the U.S. isn't one of them
(which it is), keep in mind that most workplaces are effectively stalinist
dictatorships, and bosses may not be thrilled about having their employees
discuss crypto anarchy, the overthrow of governments, or S & M on the net.

@_subject: Encrypted voice protocol? 
Yup, big article in the New York Times yesterday (front page!), and a smaller
article in today's New York Newsday.  Anyone out there have the time to post
either of them to the group???
BTW, a friend and I are just wrapping up a big anthology on radio (the new
issue of Semiotext(e), if anyone's interested).  I would have loved to get this
stuff in there, but alas, we just missed...
