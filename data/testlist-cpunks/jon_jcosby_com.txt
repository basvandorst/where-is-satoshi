@_subject: US Seeks Access to More Internet Data Without Court Order 
"The Washington Post reports that the Obama administration is seeking to
make it easier for the FBI to obtain internet records of users without a
court order. If Congress approves the plan, the FBI would be able to
secretly issue a National Security Letter to an internet provider and
obtain who users send email to, the times and dates of e-mails sent and
received, and possibly a log of every website visited. Kevin Bankston of
the Electronic Frontier Foundation said, "Our biggest concern is that an
expanded [National Security Letter] power might be used to obtain Internet
search queries and Web histories detailing every Web site visited and every
file downloaded.""
This makes me wonder, what information could an ISP provide about Internet
activity through Tor? My provider is more trustworthy than most, but this
would give me cause for concern.
