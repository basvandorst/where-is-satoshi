   [1]daten writes "VIA has released the [2]source code to their Padlock
   SL product, based on the Nullsoft WASTE code previously [3]pulled by
   AOL. Padlock SL offers encrypted chat, instant messaging and file
   sharing over a private peer-to-peer network. Unlike WASTE, which is
   still under [4]active development, the VIA client offers a graphical
   interface for both [5]Windows and Linux users and simpler
   configuration."
