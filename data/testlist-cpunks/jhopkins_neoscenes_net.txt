HI Florian --
Speaking from the Belly of the Beast (semi-rural Arizona, next to
Idaho and Alaska in terms of right-wing folks), the media consumption
and actual media content here is literally stunning -- the volume on
shouting heads (never-mind talking heads!!!) has the media consumer
floating like a half-dead fish on the surface after dynamite in the
water... It's coming from all directions, and just wait for maybe next

I believe this strange passive-aggressivity will only increase as a
feature of the whole damn thing. Where I am the dominant sentiment is
not a far stretch from rural Afghanistan where many folks are heavily

FYI, my friend, the writer George Saunders had a great book out a
couple years ago with the lead short story "The Braindead Megaphone"
which explores the chilling scenario from a harsh satirical pov... but
this shit is serious...
You are only flabberghasted 'cause, maybe, you maybe believed a tiny
bit of the 'US exceptionalism' mythology... The reality of Empire is

I stepped away from teaching (several Digital Art courses and a course

Colorado Boulder this year because of a deep inability on the part
of the students that I had to engage in any critical discourse about
technology, period. Of course, as a learning facilitator, I'm supposed
to be able to make this happen, but there was another dynamic apparent
