I have a Samsung SCH-8500 cell phone that has a built-in modem.  (You
connect it to the serial port on your computer via an overpriced cable
and send it AT commands.)  Using pppd under Linux on both the client
and server end, I dial a modem on my home machine.  The only other
piece of software I use is mgetty on the home machine to actually
answer the phone---it hands it off to pppd quite nicely.
The mgetty+sendfax documentation and the pppd manpage contain all the
information you need to get something similar working for you.

The enhanced security regulations apply only to airplanes flying under
FAR part 121---airplanes with 10 or more passengers onboard.  Those
airplanes operating under FAR part 135 (9 or fewer passengers---what
most general aviation pilots fly) are not subject to the same security
procedures; for the most part, I'd expect that people and companies
who don't fly commercial airlines are more or less ignoring the
enhanced security bullshit.  (There are other requirements for FAR
part 121---max gross weight, etc.---but for the most part, you expect
that 10 or more passengers is 121, 9 or fewer is 135.)
Up until some time in 1997, pilots who were certified only for part
135 could still fly small commuter planes.  The Clinton administration
enacted the "single level of safety" rules that required all
commercial carriers to operate under 121, mostly due to pressure from
various interests after the several ValuJet-style crashes.  However,
charters and private airplanes are still almost exclusively operated
under 135.
As to your idea for a buy-in airline, the biggest problem is going to
be that you have to have 9 or fewer people on each flight.  Because of
that, it's going to be prohibitively expensive (you're going to be
investing $5M to $10M on the plane initially, plus operating costs
around $1k/hour of flight, if not more).

The example you're thinking of, I believe, comes from Peter Wason.
Imagine you have 4 cards on a table.  On visible side of the cards is D, F, 3, and 7.  You are asked to test the hypothesis "If a card has
a D on one side, it has a 3 on the other."  Which cards do you need to
turn over to test this?
Most people would say D, or D and 3.  The correct answer is D and 7.
You need to test that the D has a 3 on the back and that the 7 does not
have a D on the back.  Since the statement is expressed as an
implication (D -> 3), you don't need to check the 3 because it wouldn't
be relevant (3 !-> D).  It's pretty obvious why you wouldn't need to
check the F.
Now, reword this same test that almost everyone fails.  You are a
bouncer at a bar and are enforcing the rule "If a person is drinking
beer, he must be 18 or older."  You may check what people are drinking
or how old they are.  Which do you have to check:  a beer drinker, a
Coke drinker, a twenty-five-year-old, or a sixteen-year-old?  It's now
pretty obvious to everyone that you need to check the first and the
Peter Wason claims that the difference here is not just the concreteness
of one versus the abstraction of the other; his claim is that the
hypothesis "if a person eats hot chili peppers, then he drinks beer" is
no easier to prove false than the original card test.  It is only the
situation in which a person tries to detect cheaters that makes this
test easy. For more on this topic, see such books as Steven Pinker's "How the Mind
Works," a reasonable introduction to modern psychology.

References: <3D3D0D4A.961.177A81 <040c01c2324e$2cca79a0$c71121c2
Doing this would violate the HTTP CONNECT semantics described in the
IETF Internet-Draft "Tunneling TCP based protocols through Web proxy
servers" by Ari Luotonen.  Not that that's stopping anyone.
I've written a perl module, Net::HTTPTunnel, that allows you to make a
CONNECT tunnel through an HTTP proxy and treat it as a normal socket
object (it's very simple---it just handles talking to the proxy server
and returns an IO::Socket::INET object).  It's available on CPAN.
Note that most proxy servers are configured to allow CONNECTs only to
port 443 (https) and 563 (snews).  Of course, all you have to do to
get around this is run an ssh server on port 443 or port 563 on a
machine you control that lives outside the firewall.
Using the above-mentioned perl module, have a program listening for
connections on your machine inside the firewall which will, upon
receiving a connection, establish a CONNECT tunnel and forward packets
in both directions.  Now all you do is ssh to that port on your local
machine and tunnel any other protocols you want through the ssh
connection (for example, run squid on the machine outside the firewall
and forward a local port to the squid server across the SSH tunnel if
you wish to conceal your at-work browsing habits).  I'm using just
such a tunnel to write this email.
Of course, there are lots of ways to make tunnels.  A good friend of
mine used to tunnel through his high school's firewall using a program
he tossed off that would get the data back and forth through the
firewall in HTTP POSTs.  Sure, it's more complicated, but when his
school turned off CONNECTs to prevent the method described above, he
took it personally.
I think there's even a program out there that creates a (very high
latency!) tunnel using email.

It's true that tubes distort differently, but not for the reason you
If you compare the transfer characteristics (Vce vs Ic with Vbe as a
parameter) of a tube to those of a transistor, you see that (using BJT
terminology) the transistor passes through saturation and reaches
linear operation at a relatively low Vce (triode/linear, saturation,
and Vds respectively, for you FETholes).  On the other hand, the tube
does not saturate quickly in this way.  If you draw a load line over
these transfer characteristics and grind through the math (or have
Matlab do the work), you'll see that BJTs and FETs produce mostly
odd-order harmonic distortion, whereas tubes produce more even-order
harmonic distortion.
The audible difference in this distortion is consistent with empirical
results from acoustic musical instruments: violins (and other stringed
acoustic instruments), which produce mostly even-order harmonics, have
a drastically different timbre from, say, a clarinet, which produces
mostly odd-order harmonics.
While I'm sure you're right that most people can't tell the difference
between .01% and .001%, I'm not sure I believe that _everyone_ likes
distortion (or, if they do, that everyone likes distortion of the same
kind or level.)  It seems that when you _re_produce a recording you
may as well do so with as much fidelity as possible, leaving it to the
artist to introduce whatever distortion they intend when they record
When I listen to Ormandy and Philadelphia perform Mahler 2 I want the
utmost fidelity; at the same time, I don't complain about the
distortion in the recording when I listen to the Smashing Pumpkins's
latest album.

If all you're trying to do is screw with surveillance cameras, a Xenon

You can probably get away with an IR laser and a diffuser or something
to that effect.  It would be cheap (diode laser) and easy to build
(for a strobe-like effect it would take, what? a 555, a couple
resistors, a cap, and the diode).
If you want, you can probably extend this idea to much more IR output
just by adding more diodes and more juice.  I don't remember the
numbers off the top of my head, but IIRC the efficiency of a diode is
substantially greater than the efficiency of a Xenon tube.
Just took a quick look around, and it seems like a Xenon would still
work at 900nm:

References: If it's the type of virus that delivers its payload as soon as it's
viewed (relying on bugs in MSOE or whatever), then it's possible that
such a thing could go undetected, especially if AV signatures haven't
been updated to stop it.  Of course, you could also just put a web bug
in an HTML email sent to the list and wait for people to view the
message in the proper viewer (read: MSOE, &c).
Other than relying on bugs (or "features") of the mail client,
however, it seems that any such system relies on the user opening a
malicious attachment.  Any reasonably clueful person knows not to do
this, so the answer to the filter question is yes; lack of stupidity
is a filter that will stop this sort of attack.  Of course, this
assumes that the mail client doesn't automagically execute the
payload; on the other hand, it could be argued that using such a
client is itself an act of stupidity.

all?) black people because he percieves them as benefitting unfairly

It seems that more and more people see "racism" where it doesn't
(necessarily) exist.  Perhaps this is simply because it's a convenient
catch-all counter-argument---"you're arguing that way because you're a
racist, hence you're immoral, hence I win," an ad hominem "trump card"
that more often than not passes for a real argument, probably because
people are afraid to voice opinions to the contrary for fear of being
labeled racists themselves.  Another more insidious possibility is
that as a result of such tactics, people actually _do_ see racism
where it isn't.  The latter worries me.  A lot.
In any case, before you tear into me for being Tim's shill, consider
whether the following examples count as X-ism:
1) I hate X people because they are X.
2) I hate X people because most people who are X are also Y.
3) I hate people who are Y.  Most people who are Y are also X.
I'd say that the first one is the very definition of X-ism.  The
second one seems to me to be a special case of Y-ism (assuming that,
as seems to be the case given the phrasing, Y's are hated for being
Y), but is not X-ism.  The third one, the one I believe describes this
situation, is not X-ism.  You might care to call into question the
generalization "most people who are Y are also X," but even that isn't
X-ism unless the generalization is motivated by a thought process

"Terror in the Skies, Again?"
Note from the E-ditors: You are about to read an account of what
happened during a domestic flight that one of our writers, Annie
Jacobsen, took from Detroit to Los Angeles. The WWS Editorial Team
debated long and hard about how to handle this information and
ultimately we decided it was something that should be shared. What
does it have to do with finances? Nothing, and everything. Here is
Annie's  story.
On June 29, 2004, at 12:28 p.m., I flew on Northwest Airlines flight
 from Detroit to Los Angeles with my husband and our young son.
Also on our flight were 14 Middle Eastern men between the ages of
approximately 20 and 50 years old.  What I experienced during that
flight has caused me to question whether the United States of America
can realistically uphold the civil liberties of every individual, even
non-citizens, and protect its citizens from terrorist threats.

Hell, as recently as three years ago the pay phones in Boston could
still be red boxed.  It may actually still be possible---I haven't tried
in a while.  Haven't done it here in Austin, either.
I discovered (probably not the first time it's been discovered, but new
to me anyway) a while ago that the autodial phones in ATMs that connect
you to the bank's Retard Line could be fooled into making phone calls
for free.  You just have to start pulse dialing with the hook before the
autodialer kicks in; if you do it right the dial tone goes away fast
enough that the autodialer never activates. I never tried simply using
my own tone dialer, but it's likely that would also work unless they're
smart enough to mute the mic.

Many still have test jacks on them.  Both my old Samsung A500 and my
current Sanyo SCP-8100 have a connector (either MC or SMA, IIRC) on the
back hidden under a rubber plug.  My guess is that with an appropriate
connector you could use, e.g., a pringles can to make your antenna much

A little poking around on google reveals that all but the most recent
Sprint phones don't support GPS at all.  They rely for location on AFLT,
advanced forward link trilateration.  That is, they look for multiple
towers, then report their delay readings to the network, allowing

Well, clearly there's the frequency on which the satellites broadcast
(~1500MHz).  I think his point was that to jam the GPS you've got to put
out RF energy on the appropriate frequency, which would then be
traceable to you.
Of course, you can do a bit better by using the external antenna jack
and feeding the signal straight into the phone.  Make sure in this
case that you're using low enough power that you don't blow up the
front end.

I don't see the benefit of adding another layer on top of the JVM.  Tor
implemented in Java should be no more or less vulnerable to attacks from
the host machine than Tor talking with a Linux kernel running on the
JVM.  Moreover, you don't actually realize a benefit in portability by
adding the Linux-on-JVM abstraction to the soup.
Admittedly, you might save some development time by just running the
extant Tor client on a Linux virtual machine, but laziness isn't really

the latter not likely in telecom, of course), sure, they have  to be on
reprogrammable structures.
If, on the other hand, you're building a custom hash cracking machine,
you don't need to reconfigure your gates. You could design your
parallelized SHA1 cracking machine and dump it onto a bunch of FPGAs,

@_subject: Noise keeps spooks out of the loop 
References: Sounds like a practical secure implementation of this will be very
difficult.  Consider that if Alice and Bob do not perfectly synchronize
the resistor transitions, there will be a window in which an attacker
will see a line that is unterminated at one end.  It's trivially easy in
this case to determine the resistance that has already been connected to
the line, and with proper equiment (e.g., TLP) it would also be possible
to determine which end of the line is unterminated.  Those two pieces of
information uniquely determine one bit of the key.
Or how about this: if the resistors are not perfectly matched, there is
a difference in resistance when Alice chooses low versus when Bob does,
leaking key information.  Beyond that, resistor properties change over
time, which requires that Alice and Bob calibrate their resistors to one
another on a regular basis. Any such calibration step gives Mallory yet
another way of corrupting the protocol.
I'm sure that at least some of these concerns are addressed, but I'd be
gravely concerned about a system where at the end of the day you're
relying on the hope that you have timed and calibrated everything to
better than the enemy's sensing noise floor.

@_subject: uniform pseudo random number generation 
References: <323390.13399.qm
It seems to me like the extent to which you can decorrelate the output
sequences is rather limited because of the requirement that each
sequence contain {0..360} precisely once, essentially because the
uniqueness requirement means that each sequence is, to a large majority,
characterized by the entropy at the beginning of the sequence, but not
at the end.
For example, let's say you have generated all but one digit of the
sequence.  Since there is only one unused number remaining, there is no
information encoded in the final digit of the sequence.  Similarly, the
second-last digit is one of only two possibilities, third-last is one of
three, et cetera.  So, at most, the second-last digit has one bit of
entropy, while the first has log2(361) =~ 8.5 bits.
If this doesn't trouble you, it should at least motivate you to attempt
to appropriately weight the digits in the sequence when you measure
correlation (correlation early in the sequence is "worse" than late,
since there's more information encoded in the early numbers).
So then, on to generating the sequence (and then back, briefly, to the
correlation question):
Let's assume you get entropy from an oracle,
(implicitly assuming here that, like in the SysV function, state gets
updated appropriately).  Also, assume the existence of a function
that removes the kth element from an array and returns a new array with
length reduced by 1, and
that appends elm to array and returns a new array with length increased
by 1.  Then:
(1) Initialize numarray = {0..360}.
(2) k = rand(state);
(3) nextInd = k mod length(numarray);
(4) nextNum = numarray[k];
(5) outarray = push(nextNum, outarray);
(5) numarray = delete(k, numarray);
(6) goto (2) while length(numarray) >= 0;
This should preserve as much entropy as possible in the generation of
your sequences.
Now, back to the correlation for a second: I claimed earlier that you
had to weight the digits by how much information they contain, but I
didn't talk about how you might do this.  If you generate the sequence
with the above method, I claim that you can easily accomplish this by
saving the sequence of k's that you generate, as long as you are careful
to store each k in a number of bits (approximately, in practice) equal
to log2(length(numarray)) for the corresponding step in the sequence. By
doing this, the early k's are guaranteed to take up more bits than the
late ones; thus correlating the sequence of k's stored in this way gives
a truer measure of the correlation of the sequences.
Just my $0.02 +/- delta...

Twelve hours (or maybe three years, depending who you are) later than

Getting it all set up on your end is not terribly difficult. In fact, in
the past I've cobbled together other implementations where everything
was dispatched through procmail filtering on the Received header (the
list ran that way in 2004 for a month or two), so feel free to riff on
the basic config as long as you don't break anything at the boundary.
The part we have to redesign is the way CDR nodes share their subscriber
lists / maintain a common whitelist. In the past this was done with
Majordomo "who", but I think it's a bad idea to enable this.
I propose instead that each node push its local subscription list to the
other nodes, possibly PGP signed to defend against the obvious attack
whereby massive amounts of garbage can be injected into the whitelist
with very little effort. (Yes, someone can still subscribe a massive
number of addresses to a node, but such activity has less leverage and
will draw attention.)
I'll put together the appropriate scripts tonight(ish), and once someone
else has a node set up we can do some testing and put the D back in CDR.

What you're talking about is a relatively high power design, which means
that in addition to worrying about designing the switching supply,
you're going to have to sweat the practical details regarding PCB
layout, et cetera.
I'd have a look at some of the reference designs and application notes
from the usual suspects (onsemi.com, ti.com, maxim-ic.com, linear.com),
since they will have a lot of good practical information on getting the
supply built. For example,
    seems to have a substantial amount of reference material available.
For more general information on theory and practice of dc/dc converter
design, "Fundamentals of Power Electronics 2e" by Erickson and
Maksimovic is my go-to reference. It more or less assumes you're already
an electrical engineer, which may or may not be useful to you. Along
these lines there's also "Principles of Power Electronics" by Kassakian
et al, a book dear to me but certainly not to all.
If you're looking for a gentler introduction, Google should be able to
point you to a few tutorials, e.g.,
    I've been kicking around an idea for a weird little buck converter
controller that I haven't actually built yet. It's not particularly well-
suited for kW converters, though, since the most basic form of the idea
involves using a P-channel device for the high side switch. For any
reasonable amount of power you end up wanting to use an N-ch, as they're
generally higher performance devices than their P-ch counterparts (in
silicon, hole mobility is about 1/3 of electron mobility, so devices
that control electrons are generally higher performance than devices
that control holes).

list before it went offline several (?) weeks ago.
First, my sincerest apologies for having failed to notice that messages
were silently dropping. All the bounces were still dropping into my
"cypherpunks bounces" mailbox, so from what I could tell all was running
normally (if perhaps at slightly low SNR). It turns out that some
package upgrade, most likely a new version of perl, broke majordomo.
(And of course, could I have picked a worse time to break everything?)
Well, that's the bad news. The good news is that cypherpunks is now
powered by Mailman, and should be a bit more reliable, easier to
maintain, and less Rube-Goldbergian. (I say this with all respect to my
cpunk admin predecessors; the CDR was a useful and interesting piece of
software, but---at least, in its most recent form---it was certainly not
a *pretty* piece of software.)
Nevertheless, since I haven't actually done much other than port the old
majordomo list over to mailman, the Distributed Remailer functionality
no longer obtains. Practically, this hasn't mattered for at least the
last 6 or 8 years, but perhaps that would change if I would just
modernize the software a bit. I'm planning on putting some thought into
that in the near future, but for now I figured it was more important to

Well played, sir. :)
By the way, the answer is in most cases no, sadly.
Most vanilla CMOS processes don't have high quality JFETs available. On
older nodes maybe you can get away with turning an N-well and a P+
diffusion into a JFET, but that doesn't work very well in more modern
processes because the N-wells have strongly retrograde doping, which
makes it hard to pinch off the "bottom" of the channel. Of course, even
at older nodes where it might be possible, the fabs don't bother
characterizing it for you. Sure, you can characterize it yourself, but
if the fab isn't supporting the device that implicitly means they're not
monitoring the quality of that device with their PCM structures, so good
luck with manufacturability long-term.
JFETs are pretty easy to make in high quality bipolar processes because
the base diffusion makes a decent JFET body. Doesn't add much/any cost
to have them in this case. Of course, if you have a BiCMOS process, then
you already have devices with high impedance gates, but for high
performance analog design a JFET beats the hell out of a MOSFET, since
the latter brings along with it a shitload of 1/f noise.
One place I've recently seen JFETs is in really high voltage processes.
Think like a mostly normal 0.18u CMOS process with a 600V (Vds) JFET
available. Haven't actually worked in such a beast, but you can imagine
that compared to MOSFETs, JFETs don't make such great power devices---
who ever heard of a depletion-mode power switch?

secrecy algorithms take more CPU time and more entropy for key exchange.
How many web servers these days are running on VMs like AWS where
entropy is a precious resource?
Apache 2.2 and earlier, without specific patches, didn't support forward
secrecy for a majority of browsers. I had to pull Apache 2.4 out of Sid
on the cpunks.org machine to get forward secrecy working with all modern
Speaking of browsers, there are still a huge number of really old
browsers out there that won't or can't (corporate policy, et cetera) be
updated any time in the near future. Turning off non-FS algos breaks SSL
for a *lot* of people.
Oh, and don't forget, OpenSSL 0.98(ish) and before didn't support the FS
algorithms. So the many servers where OpenSSL isn't getting upgraded any
time soon can't do it either.
Even if you do happen to have a conforming version of the appropriate
software server-side, you've still got to worry about actually setting
up the key order preferences appropriately. Few if any vendors are
shipping default configs that enable FS.
At least this last one is something we stand a chance of changing,
though: perhaps a start would be to submit bugs against the web server
packages from the usual suspects (debian et al) asking them to turn on
forward secrecy by default?

I have no problem with building anything and everything on my own if I
have to, and I've done Linux From Scratch before, but there is an
*immediate* increase in maintenance headache associated with breaking
out of the package manager, especially in distributions like debian
where there isn't much of a premium on flexibility.
But in the worst case, yes, of course!
I've done some godawful things before like build new versions of libc
and run chrooted out of my homedir on machines with outdated software.
It is doable, but it is very painful.
There are plenty of tools that make this a lot easier, though: you can
use vagrant to painlessly get a modern distribution running inside
VirtualBox, assuming you can get the latter running on your machine.
These approaches aren't particularly high performance, but we're
obviously optimizing for something else in this case.
Provide a patch with your bug report. Never underestimate the power of
an easily-closed ticket.

Interesting to see this mentioned here. Mike Walfish and Andrew Blumberg
have written a nice survey on the work in this area:
    Justin Thaler provides another perspective:
    I can also add a little context to this conversation---I've actually
done an independent re-implementation of the work of Ben-Sasson et al
that Sean linked above.
At a high level, my take is that this area has huge potential, but
neither this work nor other projects in the area (summarized below) are
really practical---yet. The overhead for the party constructing the
proof is at least 3 orders of magnitude more than the cost of running
the computation directly. The work of Ben-Sasson et al costs more like 6
orders of magnitude! (In principle, though, they are paying this price
to achieve greater computational generality.)
The work required of the party verifying the computation is also non-trivial: while *checking* the answer is quick, these systems (with
one exception) require pre-processing work on the computation being
verified, and the cost of this is several orders of magnitude larger
than simply computing the result directly. (Note, however, that this
cost can be amortized by outsourcing the same computation over many
different inputs.)
But there is some real hope here: the rate at which progress is being
made is impressive (two years ago overhead was more like 20 orders of
magnitude than three!), and there are contexts where the extra work is
worth the cost. Perhaps one of these is a cryptocurrency that relies on
proof of "useful" work.
With regard to smooth difficulty adjustment: since the goal of most of
these projects is to encode arbitrary computations, the problems of
difficulty adjustment and proof of work become orthogonal.
For those wanting a bit more detail:
Broadly speaking, there are four research groups working on this stuff:
  - Ben-Sasson et al at Technion/Tel Aviv/MIT
          - Parno et al at Microsoft Research
          - Thaler et al at Harvard
          - Walfish et al at UT Austin/NYU (full disclosure: I work with these guys)
        The work of Thaler et al is somehat distinct from the other three
because, while it is extremely efficient for certain computations,
it is not general: the efficiency improvements it offers are limited
to computations with a regular underlying structure. However, when
this requirement is met, it has very low overhead compared to the
other three systems, and it involves no costly pre-processing.
The three other groups have built systems that compile from a subset of C to a form whose result can be encoded into a probabilistically
checkable proof. The resulting PCP is huge, so in all three systems the
result is not the proof itself. Rather, the proof is queried and the
result used for verification. The method of querying is one
distinguishing factor between these systems.
Ben-Sasson et al and Parno et al share common ancestry in the work of
Gennaro et al, also at Microsoft Research.
    In both cases, the query/response take the form of a noninteractive
argument. Basically, the queries are encrypted and bundled into the
description of the computation ahead of time, after which the
computation can be run by providing an input and requesting an answer.
These systems also support public verifiability, allowing the answer to
be checked by anyone holding the public verification key.
The work of Ben-Sasson et al achieves more generality by encoding
computations as the execution of a virtual microprocessor, then
verifying correct execution of the processor. This system supports full C semantics and achieves an efficient abstraction for verified RAM
(again, at a penalty of 3 *additional* orders of magnitude beyond the
other systems).
The UT/NYU group have also adapted a simplification of Gennaro et al,
but their system really rests upon refinements of the efficient argument
systems of Ishai et al.
    In this case, verification involves two separate interactions, one that
establishes a commitment to the proof and one that queries it. Though it
requires interaction, the advantage of this approach is that it is
cryptographically simpler. Concretely, the crypto is one of the most
expensive parts of the system, so this simplification results in good
performance relative to the other systems.
The UT/NYU group have also developed verifiable storage abstractions,
including the ability to verify computations (in zero knowledge) on
hidden state for which you hold a cryptographic commitment.

It was around 2005 that the last few nodes dropped off the old CDR, so
it's been quite a while since we've been distributed.
I went back through the list archives late last year in search of the
history of the CDR. While I'm sure others can add more to the skeleton,
what I found went into the Cypherpunk Wikipedia entry (with references
to archived emails where possible).
To be honest, I'm not sure distribution is a response to any real
threat: to the extent that the Cpunks list is of interest, isn't it more
sensible to keep it alive and monitored than to shut it down? Of course,
as J.A. points out, there are plenty of other reasons, viz., different
list policies at different nodes (reply-to:, subject modification,
sender whitelisting, etc.)---and these create some problems that we'll
have to address in designing CDRv2.
So let's talk a bit about the CDR architecture.
One obvious issue with the old one is that it was a bit rickety: at its
heart it was a bandaid fractal built on top of procmail and Majordomo,
and getting it set up took enough work that most people didn't want to
do it. To this end, I suggest we build upon mailman this time around:
the codebase is reasonably well maintained, plenty of people feel
comfortable hacking in Python, and we automatically get more user
friendliness in the subscriber and administrative interfaces.
(In principle, an even better way to do this would be to cleanly
separate the CDR functionality from the list management functionality so
that individual nodes can decide on their own what list software to run.
This probably ends up expanding the time cost of the project well in
excess of the utility it generates, so my vote would be against making
this a requirement.)
One major question we need to address is the topology of the CDR network
itself. From an implementation point of view it would be most
straightforward if every node knew about every other node, but one could
argue that this is too fragile. If we take that position, we have to
solve a broadcast repeater problem: when a node receives a message, it
needs to have some way of deciding what other nodes it forwards messages
to. Obviously we'd like to do this in a way that doesn't result in a lot
of useless echoes. (Recognizing that perfect is the enemy of good may be
the better part of valor here; after all, we don't expect to have more
than a handful of CDR nodes.)
As before, we want to be able to have independent policies at each node
at least with respect to:
    - subject line modification
    - header mangling (reply-to: etc)
    - attachments
    - sender whitelisting
    - other things I'm forgetting
As far as I can tell, the ones that will require the most work are
subject line modification and sender whitelisting.
Mangling the subject line becomes a problem because eventually we end up
with subjects like "[CDR] Re: [Cpunks] Re: [Cypherpunks] foo", which
confuses a lot of mail clients. This isn't a problem for monolithic
mailman setups because mailman knows not to add another prefix to
outgoing messages that already have one, but the problem becomes more
difficult when each node potentially has its own (possibly empty)
prefix. This problem would have a trivial solution in the case that all
nodes knew the tagging policy at all other nodes, but (as I point out
above) we may prefer not to require nodes to know all other nodes in the
CDR. (The fallback solution is the old one: manually construct an
appropriate filter to demangle subject lines. Yech.)
In the old CDR (possibly after the LNE.com modifications circa 2001),
nodes had to expose their sender lists (at least to other nodes) to
allow for member whitelisting. Obviously this is ripe for abuse, and I'd
prefer to achieve this in a different way if possible. The goal here is
to make it easy to verify that a given sender is subscribed to *some*
node but difficult to enumerate all list subscribers. I can see how one
might think of this as coddling the supposedly savvy and internet-
hardened subscribers of the list, but I just don't see any reason to
expose users to more abuse than necessary, especially when solutions to
this problem have already been described and are nominally right in the
cpunks wheelhouse!
I have a skeleton architecture in mind that can be beaten into a shape
capable of addressing the above issues, but as this email is getting
long and I've doubtless forgotten several other important problems,
let's discuss a bit more first.

And a poor one indeed :)
Lest anyone misinterpret the quotes, I assure you I do nothing of the
sort. The *only* filtering that goes on is subscriber whitelisting.
I've been subscribed to cpunks in one form or other since the early 90s,
and thinking back to those days makes the worries about SNR on the list
now seem like nothing. By my recollection it wasn't until circa 2001
that any of the distributed remailer nodes even had sender whitelisting;
even with the worst flaming the SNR now is an order of magnitude better
than what we'd get prior to Ericm's LNE.com node.

 <20140120174842.GA1034
As far as I can tell this doesn't (yet) solve the problem of
whitelisting subscribers to other nodes.
However, we can add one more step and solve this: when a node receives
an email from the repeater whose sender is a member of the node's local
subscriber list, it bounces the message back to the repeater with an
added header saying, in effect, "I vouch for this sender."
Other nodes employing sender whitelisting would ignore the first email,
since its sender isn't locally whitelisted and it lacks the
aforementioned node-auth header, but would presumably forward the second
email, assuming they chose to trust the node that is vouching for the
sender. Nodes with no whitelisting policy could safely ignore the second
email by filtering out duplicate msgids or something similar.
I'm not totally in love with the master repeater scheme, though.
Notwithstanding my previous comments regarding the supposed threat model
behind the CDR's original conception, as long as we're paying the fixed
cost of setting up a new system we may as well get *some* additional
reliability out of it, right?

In CDRv1, all nodes would in principle forward all messages to other
nodes, only filtering the feed going to that node's own users according
to the local filtering policy.
It makes sense to ask nodes to publish details of their local policies.
I think personally I would hesitate to peer with any node that didn't
forward everything and let me apply my own filter. I assume most other
operators would as well, so practically speaking no one would run a node
that didn't (claim to) forward everything.
Next question: how paranoid are we, i.e., do we attempt to enforce this
policy somehow? This goes beyond fault tolerance towards attempting to
solve the problem of enforcing peering contracts with untrusted CDRv2
nodes, which is clearly a more... intersting one.
I have been busy with real life, and haven't dedicated much more time to
thinking about this. I'm hopeful that tomorrow I will have the
opportunity to do so at least a little bit.

I'm not sure if you mean on the backend (between nodes) or on the
frontend (local delivery to node subscribers).
In the former case, I agree: it makes sense to just have a blanket
policy that peered nodes are expected to forward everything they receive
at their ingress address (allowing other nodes to apply their own local
filtering policies).
If you mean the latter, I disagree that zero filtering is a good
approach to running a node (but the whole point is that we can make both
available and let the users choose). In practice, I'm quite certain that
readership on the present cypherpunks envisagement would drop
precipitously if I turned off sender whitelisting. There's a difference
between "I can do this" and "I will do this because it is worth my
time." The fact is, once the cost of being a subscriber exceeds its
utility, a rational person will unsubscribe; a node with sender
whitelisting (with explicit whitelisting for anonymous remailers)
achieves a balance that, empirically, is worthwhile for most people:
recall the rush to LNE.com when Eric introduced this. More to the point,
the willingness of a person to sink time into wading through list
detritus is no indication of his or her value as a contributor.
Fundamentally, subscriber lists are a good metric by which to judge
whether a particular message should or should not be delivered; it is
therefore useful to build the notion of cross-node sender whitelisting
into CDRv2 in a way that cannot be trivially abused. Of course, all
sender whitelisting leaks *some* information about subscribers; the goal
is just to do no worse than a monolithic list.
No doubt about it; I'm certainly not volunteering to do any such thing!

@_subject: cypherpunks administrivia: no more reply-to header stripping 
Until now, mailman has been stripping Reply-To: headers from messages
to the list. I've just turned this off.
Some webmail services (notably, Yahoo!) set the Reply-To: header and
include it in the headers signed with DKIM. Stripping Reply-To: thus
breaks the DKIM signature. In the case of Yahoo! this signature
breakage is especially problematic, because their DMARC policy is set
to reject. (In other words, messages with yahoo.com in the From:
header that fail both SPF and DKIM should be rejected by compliant
mail services, e.g., AOL, Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo!)
Messages to the mailing list should pass SPF, since the envelope
sender domain for list messages is cpunks.org and I publish an
appropriate spf RR. However, any list subscriber who forwards mail to
another account will have broken SPF and an invalid DKIM signature,
which trips the DMARC policy and causes delivery failures.
I realize that this might cause some inconvenience, but I would prefer
to err on the side of successfully delivering messages whenever
possible. If you're using procmail and prefer the old behavior, the
following recipe should suffice:

Cryptography rearranges power: it configures who can do what, from
what. This makes cryptography an inherently political tool, and it
confers on the field an intrinsically moral dimension. The Snowden

positioning of cryptography. They lead one to ask if our inability to
effectively address mass surveillance constitutes a failure of our

develop more effective means to resist mass surveillance. I plea for a
reinvention of our disciplinary culture to attend not only to puzzles

I've given some thought to an alternative setup, i.e., a new version
of the CDR. At some point I hope to find more time for that project.

But that just gives away the bitstream describing the FPGA
configuration (say, a trusted CPU). Is the CPU's *design* a secret? If
not, I don't see why it matters that an evil cleaner might read out the
FPGA's configuration. (Obviously, don't store secret keys in there!)
If we really are worried about keeping the CPU's design a secret, it's
possible with many FPGAs to encrypt the configuration bitstream such
that the configuration is decrypted onboard the FPGA at power-on. This
is intended to handle the case where I want to sell a product that uses
an FPGA without revealing the contents of that FPGA's configuration to
my customers or competitors.
Of course, this doesn't really provide useful security guarantees
against a sophisticated adversary. First, since the FPGA contains or
automatically derives the secret key to decrypt this encrypted bitstream,
the manufacturer of the FPGA likely also knows the key or how to derive
it (as does anyone with sufficient dedication and a well-equipped lab).
Second, we have no idea how well this system is designed or implemented,
since the bitstream security system is itself a proprietary secret. And
third, even if it's competently built, as I pointed out above, the threat
model is "customer reads out my proprietary design," which means that,
practically speaking, the technological barrier is only there to support
a more comprehensive framework of legal recourse in the case that my
customer or competitor tries to steal the secret sauce.
Probably a reasonable evil cleaner attack against an FPGA-based
"trusted" CPU is to overwrite the contents of the configuration
ROM with a similar but subtly bugged design. This is more or less
isomorphic to "the NSA signs bugged microcode for my Intel CPU."
Cue the OTP / epoxy / physical security arms race, I guess.

Ah, I see. I thought the focus was on cold boot or evil maid attacks
against FPGA-based (thus, nominally trustworthy) CPUs, and how these
attacks might compare to similar attacks against a commercial CPU.
As you pointed out before, one may as well just grab the configuration
out of the ROM itself, and I agree---but my point was that either way,
what are we getting except some information that's not really secret?
So I think we're in violent agreement, at least to the extent that
we're talking about the same thing :)
Also: one assumes that cold boot attacks against the contents of
RAM are more useful than against the SRAMs that hold the FPGA's
configuration, and in that case probably it's little different from
the equivalent attack against a commercial CPU (the DRAM is more
or less the same whether we're talking about the commercial or the
FPGA-based CPU---you're using the same DIMMs either way).
On further reflection, I suppose the contents of the block RAMs inside
the FPGA (little SRAMs sprinkled through the fabric) might be a prize
worth chasing, since those are presumably acting as registers and
cache for our CPU. It *might* be possible to do so by cold booting the
FPGA with a configuration that dumps the contents of the block RAMs,
assuming that those contents aren't cleared by power-on reset or the
configuration process itself.
To your point above about auditing the configuration actually running
on an FPGA: that would be very interesting to prevent against an FPGA
manufacturer going the reflections-on-trusting-trust route.
Here's one way an evil FPGA manufacturer might proceed: the CAD
software that the manufacturer provides with the FPGA detects that
you're synthesizing a CPU. Rather than emit a flawed bitstream
(which might be detectable just by examining the bitstream itself),
perhaps the software would hide in the bitstream some instructions
that direct the FPGA's configuration state machine to introduce flaws
at config time.
(FPGA config bitstreams are big, complicated, and proprietary; so
it's not impossible that they contain enough redundancy that one
could use stego to hide such commands in the bitstream.)
(This approach also helps to get around the fact that the synthesis
and fitting process does a randomized search for a configuration
that meets your criteria (e.g., speed, size, etc.). In other words:
the best time to detect "this guy is trying to build a CPU" is when
the software is reading your Verilog, not when it's loading the
bitstream into an FPGA, because it's really really hard to decide
"this is a CPU" just by examining the bitstream itself.)
But I suppose if I were so devious as a manufacturer of FPGAs as to
detect a CPU design and introduce subtle bugs as a result, I would
probably also do my best to keep you from detecting it, even if you
*are* able to read out the config from a running FPGA. It's quite a
large haystack for hiding such a little needle...
(And regarding cold booting to read out the config SRAMs: I worry even
more here than in the case of block RAMs that these have a carefully
designed power-on reset scheme in place so that the FPGA fabric comes
up in a known state.)

References: If your web browsing habits don't include NoScript, then you're likely no
worse off using pdf.js to view PDFs than you are browsing arbitrary websites.
After all, pdf.js has no more or less permissions than any other JS you might
encounter in the wild; and since pdf.js is bundled with modern versions of
Firefox, you might be inclined to think that it's likely non-malicious even if
it's exploitable by rogue PDFs. But that's no worse than some JS malware you
were fed via DNS poisoning or CDN hijacking.
(This can be seen either as an implicit endorsement of pdf.js or of NoScript.)

Not at all. This is some error in either your setup or mine; if the
latter, I apologize, and will take steps to fix it asap.
If you can email me details regarding the bounces you're seeing, I'm
guessing we can get to the bottom of this quickly. I have not seen any
traffic to the administrative address indicating that there's something
wrong, but that is no assurance that the failure is not my fault.

Juan, I like the cut of your jib, even when I don't agree with you.
But what's with all this speculation that cpunks will become moderated?
And how do you propose that a bunch of people who have no connection to

To be clear: I have no intention of moderating this list, ever. I'm too
