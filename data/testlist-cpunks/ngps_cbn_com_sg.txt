Aegis, which was mentioned on this list some months ago, is the best
of the lot, IMHO. No remailer support: You can talk to a remailer from an email program. ;)

: The IP spoofing attack started at about 14:09:32 PST on 12/25/94.  The first
: probes were from toad.com (this info derived from packet logs):
: : 14:09:32 toad.com# finger -l : 14:10:21 toad.com# finger -l : 14:10:50 toad.com# finger -l root at server
: 14:11:07 toad.com# finger -l : 14:11:38 toad.com# showmount -e x-terminal
: 14:11:49 toad.com# rpcinfo -p x-terminal
: 14:12:05 toad.com# finger -l root at x-terminal
Again, quoting Shimomura's mail:
: About six minutes later, we see a flurry of TCP SYNs (initial connection
: requests) from 130.92.6.97 to port 513 (login) on server...
: 130.92.6.97 appears to be a random (forged) unused address (one that will : not generate any response to packets sent to it)...
Given that this was a _spoofing_ attack, mayhaps the packets from toad.com were also forgeries. Anyone in the know?

Duh! Bought my 1st edition in a prominent local bookstore, which had only 2 copies left. (Or maybe they only carried 2 copies. ;) Am waiting
for the 2nd edition to arrive. Or may just order it myself.
