Good luck with it.  From the name it figures that you're gonna use the PGP as the engine.
As an aside, several years ago... I knew people who used 'crypto-phones'...all they did was time-slicing and basic simple scrambling.
They sliced up the conversation into 1/100ths of a second and regurgitated it at the other end.  A friend of mine could listen to the 'encoded' output and tell you exactly what they were saying...in real time :>
I guess PGP should be better  (or 1/10000 sec time slices :> )
just for interest.

Well, I know some shops have so called 'switch' or 'smart' cards to debit your account, some of these are on their own credit line, others are not.
I have an account with a bank in Britain which gives me a "VISA" Card which is actually a 'direct-debit' card.  I can use it (and have) all around the world as a regular VISA card and in any 'VISA compatible' ATM.
As soon as my balance drops to zero, I can no longer use it.  And when I do, the money jumps out of my account immediately and can no longer be used.
This is a bank-issued card, and also acts as my ATM card to access my current account - there is NO charge for this.  I'm not sure exactly how that works.
Whether or not VISA would accept a proposal from First National Cyberphunks or not remains to be seen...

When we say 'anonymous video-conferencing' here, I take it that's not the same as in videophones whereby you sit there and have your mugshot transmitted across to the other party... that would be distinctly un-anonymous :)
The thing being, say you set up an anonymous-video-or-otherwise-remailer, you have to ensure that people don't manage to get into that as such would obviously give away the identities of all parties.  Given that people can supposedly hack the DOD computer system, that doesn't seem so unlikely, so are anonymous-remailers really all that safe?

Oops, what I meant to add onto that last bit was that if you're required to keep records of the to and from, and especially the contents, you are severely likely to be raided by some govt agency whenever they wanna see who said what.
I'd think twice about using a remailer that kept records on it all.

"Have you ever seen a grown man naked?", I think that's how they put it in Airplane - Flying High, the movie from the early 80s I think, before going on with the Turkish prison bit.
Basically there is a lot of sex between the men in jails there, and mostly unwanted but forced.
PS if you get really stuck, you could ask your folks.

@_subject: Another problem w/Data Havens... 
I'd prefer to see a redunancy system here whereby the pieces each contain a cypher strip of info on the location of the others (not the entire location listing, that would be too insecure)
Maybe a few locations to store the loations of the segments.
just a thought.
