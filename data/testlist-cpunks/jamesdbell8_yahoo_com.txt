Because of the follow message(s), I feel the need to set the record straight.  For the record, I have no intention of putting any 'bets', 'donations', or 'predictions' into Sanjuro's (or anyone else's) 'Assassination Market'-type system!  First, as I think will be obvious, I am merely one of about 7.1 billion humans on Earth.  Any 'bets' I would make would be insignificant and therefore superfluous.  Secondly, right now I consider investing in my isotope-modified fiber-optic invention       as being by far my highest priority.  (My primary need at this point is raising money to 'buy' about 100 national-stage patents from nations around the world.  There is no international patent system, at least other than Europe.  An invention must be patented in any nation where patent protection is desired.)  Disclaimer:  I am not involved with Sanjuro's 'Assassination Market' in any way.  I do not know who he is.

Okay, thank you for clarifying this matter.  I merely Google-searched for  'EDFA quantum entanglement' and found and cited this paper, and that only because it referred to the problem of trying to amplify quantum signals through an EDFA.  Myself, I am hoping that longer-key public-key cryptosystems will remain unsolved by quantum techniques, at least as long as it takes to get rid of governments.  After that, it probably won't matter.  As of now, it looks like things will go the way I'd like.

 From: Sean Lynch I am limited by the fact that I have only had a couple of classes which touched upon quantum physics (and 35 years ago, to boot), I wonder if there will be some limit to how far these quantum techniques can be used to factor huge numbers. (Speculation warning!)   A 1 centimeter difference in altitude in Earth's gravitational field results in about a 1 part in 10**18 time dilation.  Even if the atoms making up a quantum computer could be maintained  within 1 micron altitude, that would be a time dilation difference of 1 part in 10**22.   Could there be an effect which would allow the factorization of numbers up to, say, 22 digits long, but that would fail if the number was 301 digits long?  (equivalent to 1024 bits.)   Such a computer might be raised into earth orbit to take advantage of micro-gravity effects, but even that might only raise the limit by a few orders of magnitude, say 22+6 = 28.  Someone much more familiar with quantum mechanics
 should be able to shed light on this speculation.

@_subject: Exclusive: Secret contract tied NSA and security industry pioneer 
By Joseph Menn SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As a key part of a campaign to embed encryption software that it could crack into widely used computer products, the U.S. National Security Agency arranged a secret $10 million contract with RSA, one of the most influential firms in the computer security industry, Reuters has learned.
Documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden show that the NSA created and promulgated a flawed formula for generating random numbers to create a "back door" in encryption products, the New York Times reported in September. Reuters later reported that RSA became the most important distributor of that formula by rolling it into a software tool called Bsafe that is used to enhance security in personal computers and many other products.
Undisclosed until now was that RSA received $10 million in a deal that set the NSA formula as the preferred, or default, method for number generation in the BSafe software, according to two sources familiar with the contract. Although that sum might seem paltry, it represented more than a third of the revenue that the relevant division at RSA had taken in during the entire previous year, securities filings show.
The earlier disclosures of RSA's entanglement with the NSA already had shocked some in the close-knit world of computer security experts. The company had a long history of championing privacy and security, and it played a leading role in blocking a 1990s effort by the NSA to require a special chip to enable spying on a wide range of computer and communications products.
RSA, now a subsidiary of computer storage giant EMC Corp, urged customers to stop using the NSA formula after the Snowden disclosures revealed its weakness.
RSA and EMC declined to answer questions for this story, but RSA said in a statement: "RSA always acts in the best interest of its customers and under no circumstances does RSA design or enable any back doors in our products. Decisions about the features and functionality of RSA products are our own."
The NSA declined to comment.
The RSA deal shows one way the NSA carried out what Snowden's documents describe as a key strategy for enhancing surveillance: the systematic erosion of security tools. NSA documents released in recent months called for using "commercial relationships" to advance that goal, but did not name any security companies as collaborators.
The NSA came under attack this week in a landmark report from a White House panel appointed to review U.S. surveillance policy. The panel noted that "encryption is an essential basis for trust on the Internet," and called for a halt to any NSA efforts to undermine it.
Most of the dozen current and former RSA employees interviewed said that the company erred in agreeing to such a contract, and many cited RSA's corporate evolution away from pure cryptography products as one of the reasons it occurred.
But several said that RSA also was misled by government officials, who portrayed the formula as a secure technological advance.
"They did not show their true hand," one person briefed on the deal said of the NSA, asserting that government officials did not let on that they knew how to break the encryption.
STORIED HISTORY
 View gallery    A National Security Agency (NSA) data gathering facility is seen in Bluffdale, about 25 miles (40 km …
Started by MIT professors in the 1970s and led for years by ex-Marine Jim Bidzos, RSA and its core algorithm were both named for the last initials of the three founders, who revolutionized cryptography. Little known to the public, RSA's encryption tools have been licensed by most large technology companies, which in turn use them to protect computers used by hundreds of millions of people.
At the core of RSA's products was a technology known as public key cryptography. Instead of using the same key for encoding and then decoding a message, there are two keys related to each other mathematically. The first, publicly available key is used to encode a message for someone, who then uses a second, private key to reveal it.

Privacy Advocate Exposes High-Tech NSA Spy Gadgets Monday, 30 Dec 2013 03:43 PM
Share: A well-known privacy advocate has given the public an unusually explicit peek into the intelligence world's tool box, pulling back the curtain on the National Security Agency's arsenal of high-tech spy gear.
Independent journalist and security expert Jacob Appelbaum on Monday told a hacker conference in Germany that the NSA could turn iPhones into eavesdropping tools and use radar wave devices to harvest electronic information from computer even if they weren't online.
Appelbaum told hundreds of computer experts gathered at Hamburg's Chaos Communications Conference that his revelations about the NSA's capabilities "are even worse than your worst nightmares."
"What I am going to show you today is wrist-slittingly depressing," he said.
Even though in the past six months there have been an unprecedented level of public scrutiny of the NSA and its methods, Appelbaum's claims — supported by what appeared to be internal NSA slideshows — still caused a stir.
One of the slides described how the NSA can plant malicious software onto Apple Inc.'s iPhone, giving American intelligence agents the ability to turn the popular smartphone into a pocket-sized spy.
Another slide showcased a futuristic-sounding device described as a "portable continuous wave generator," a remote controlled device which — when paired with tiny electronic implants — can bounce invisible waves of energy off keyboards and monitors to see what is being typed even if the target device isn't connected to the Internet.
A third slide showcased a piece of equipment called NIGHTSTAND, which can tamper with wireless Internet connections from up to 8 miles away.
An NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said that she wasn't aware of Appelbaum's presentation, but that in general should would not comment on "alleged foreign intelligence activities."
"As we've said before:  NSA's focus is on targeting the communications of valid foreign intelligence targets — not on collecting and exploiting a class of communications or services that would sweep up communications that are not of bona fide foreign intelligence interest to the U.S. government."
The documents included in Appelbaum's presentation were first published by German magazine Der Spiegel Sunday and Monday.
Appelbaum and Der Spiegel have both played an important role in the disclosures of NSA leaker Edward Snowden, but neither has clarified whether the most recent set of slides came from Snowden.

I currently do not have a PGP key.  This lack is not entirely due to laziness or ignorance.  I also don't know anybody locally who has a PGP key, so I can't enter into the 'web of trust'.  And having been so long disassociated with the CP list (and computers, too:  Having been stuck in prison or denied access to computers for most of 15 years), I don't even recall how to do it.  I have another reason to not 'do' PGP:  Particularly due to the (unexpected) arrival of this 'Sanjuro' person, I am well aware that there are probably more than a few Feds who are on ultra-high alert, and from their point of view they may think of me as being "Suspect   If I go back and start using PGP again (even if only for signing things) I wonder what they will think.  At the moment I have little need for secrecy, so I choose to not do PGP.
(Also, I am virtually assuming that everything on my computer can be, and probably is, being read by a few dozen spy organizations of technically-competent nations.  I use ordinary anti-virus programs, but I'm under no illusion that the NSA/CIA/GCHQ/TLA's of other nations can't devise a targeted bug that such software cannot find.)     If any of you are interested in helping me confirm or deny this paranoid suspicion, I would very much appreciate your assistance.)

    I think my 'counter-surveillance' was a factor, but not in the way most (relatively uninformed) people might think.  You see, upon my release in April 2000, I strongly suspected that the Feds had been engaging in corruption and illegal actions against me (Google 'Ryan Thomas Lund'; also, it's in the July 2003 re-filing of my lawsuit 'Revision 1.06'        ) and I publicly announced that I would be investigating the facts and would eventually file a lawsuit. Primarily, during the summer of 2000, I visited the last-registered-addresses of vehicles that had been used on Father's Day Sunday 1998 to surveill me when I drove to a relative's house to attend her birthday party.  I suspected that those vehicles had been acquired by the Feds, and that they WOULDN'T be found at their last registered address.  (I had the Oregon DMV database on CDROM).  Turns out, I was absolutely correct.   (see, for example, 
    )
    What I DIDN'T know (in April 2000) was that since June 1999, the Feds had been faking an appeal in the 9th Circuit court of appeals (case 99-30210).  Quite literally, the appeal was initiated, and from the record it would have appeared that I was trying to handle the appeal myself.  But nobody told me about that appeal, and in fact at least a couple dozen pieces of legal mail that should have come to me at (first) Seatac FDC jail, and subsequently Phoenix FCI prison, were stolen (never delivered) by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) staff.  Further, I knew nothing of the law at that time.   (Note:  This version of the lawsuit was finalized under trying circumstances just days after I had first read the docket for appeal case 99-30210, so I couldn't write in detail about that fake appeal.  Subsequent amendments (around September 2004, as I recall) were far more detailed in my accusations.)
  The number of Federal felonies that were committed against me must have been immense.  Why they initiated, and kept secret, this fake appeal case, I still do not know.  But _THEY_ KNEW what they had done.  And, in about April 2000, I wrote a letter to the Ninth Circuit (still entirely unaware of case 99-30210) asking for an appeal in the underlying probation-revocation case.  (97-5270).  (I had been told by a 'jailhouse lawyer' in about January 2000 that I had a right to an appeal of that case).  At the time, I didn't know that to get an appeal, I'd have had to ask for an appeal (send in a "Notice of Appeal" document) within 10 working days of the 'entry of judgment' on the case.  I hadn't done that, and by the rules they would have been able to refuse me that appeal.  EXCEPT that there was ALREADY an appeal going, 99-30210!   And my request for an appeal, coupled with my public statements that I suspected corruption, probably put a world of
 fear into those who had been committing those crimes against me.  They knew I was on their track, and they presumably were afraid that I would discover what they had done.
    What I think was done was this:  They assigned a corrupt lawyer, ostensibly to represent me, "Jonathan Solovy", after having RE-forged the docket for appeal 99-30210 (probably in May 2000).  Solovy's job, as I later derived, was to APPEAR to write and file that appeal.  He did, and he lost.  But he didn't send me a copy of the docket for that case.  Had he done so, or had he asked me one of one hundred questions ("I see you've been working on this appeal for 10 months!  What are your appeal issues...?) I would have been instantly alerted that I hadn't initiated that appeal in April 2000, as I thought I had.  Solovy's job was to conceal from me the corrupt nature of the events around appeal 99-30210, and he did so.  I found out the true nature of fake appeal 99-30210 about June 20, 2003, after I received a copy of the docket for that case from the clerks' office of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
The corrupt lawyer, Robert Leen, was assigned to me about November 21, 2000.  I learned early that he didn't intend to actually defend me.  I sent a letter to the (corrupt) judge Tanner about December 8, 2000, telling him that I had 'fired' Leen.  Tanner's response was to refuse to let me fire Leen.  At that point, I realized that I would be fighting not merely the prosecution, but also 'my' attorney and the judge.  I began learning the law, and put a lot of effort into self-written motions and objections.  I even filed a 'Notice of Interlocutory Appeal' in late March 2001, just before my 'trial', which divested jurisdiction from that court to proceed.  Naturally, they simply ignored this, Leen, prosecutor Robb London (who currently works as the Communications Director at Harvard Law School), and judge Tanner.    Much of this is described in my lawsuit.   Like I said, the level of corruption used against me was immense.

Since the issue was just raised about me needing a PGP key (presumably, for now, just for signing purposes), it occurred to me that the best way to get that key signed would be for me to attend a meeting of Cypherpunks.  Since many such meetings occur in the Bay Area (San Francisco and environs) I could come from Vancouver Washington (Just across the Columbia river from Portland) and attend an upcoming Cypherpunks meeting.  What I'd appreciate would be a local who could provide transportation (I don't do 'credit card' and they probably wouldn't rent a car to me if I did!), and possibly a place to stay for 2-3 days.  Does this sound like a plan?  I could bring my BOP (Bureau of Prisons) ID, smuggled out when I was released, and auction it off for bitcoins, to pay for my expenses. (It's sure to be a collector's item someday!)

My understanding (from reading the Wikipedia article on Swartz an hour ago) was that he accessed "PACER" information.   (     )    The information in PACER (which I have used a few times before, for example to access the docket for fake, forged, fraudulent "appeal" case 99-30210) is simply Federal court case files.  (Dockets; filings).  This material is legally in the public domain:  It is not even copyrighted.  I don't know if Swartz did anything 'illegal' to get into the computer that had the information, but I doubt that.
   Incidentally, the charge for PACER documents is now $0.10 per page, but if you run up a charge of less than $15.00 in a calendar quarter, there is no charge.  (In other words, less than 150 pages downloaded are free)

 From: coderman When I started work at Intel in early July 1980, Intel was somewhat of a backwater of the semiconductor manufacturing companies.  It had about 15,000 employees, and it was best known for EPROMs, high-speed static RAMs, and 5-volt-only DRAMs.  (I was hired as a product engineer for a 'pseudostatic' (self-refreshing DRAM) labelled the 2186 (8K by 8), which had fuse-driven redundancy).   It was about this time that the 8088 microprocessor was chosen by IBM to run their IBM PC (A big mistake:  I thought the 8086/88 and its 'segmentation' sucked, especially with its puny 64 kilobyte segments, and worse, a 12-bit overlap between the address register and the segment register, limiting the address to 1 megabytes), but the boost to business would not arrive until late 1981 or so.  And worse, the 8088, with its 8-bit data bus, was little faster than a Z-80 microprocessor.  It's not that choosing the 8086 would have been vastly better, but at least that would
 have smoothed the transition to 80286 that was done with the IBM AT, since the bus would already have been 16-bit wide.
I never heard of it.  But if I knew the GPS, maybe I'd visit...  Maybe that's what they did with the set for 'Goonies'.
I wouldn't be surprised!

@_subject: "Reforms" to NSA spying 
A few days ago I read of 'reforms' being proposed to NSA spying on phone and internet metadata, along the lines of requiring the government to obtain some sort of warrant to get data from the phone companies, etc.  Progress?  I doubt it.  Looks to me like the government knows it's going to lose control of the data, and probably there are no requirements that such phone co's keep 'all' the data.  I predict that any proposed new bill will contain requirements that the phone co's record 'all' of the data the government might want, and keep it for an extended period of time.  The government knows that if no such requirement is put into law, phone co's will compete for customers by offering ever-more-complete privacy.   Soon enough, no phone company will store metadata, or they will store it in such a way that it will be useless for government purposes.

 <20131105195616.GA14382     I don't quite know why I received the message below, but I am answering (including cypherpunks at cpunks.org) since it seems a good time to do so given the humorous connection to my isotopically-modified optical fiber invention.  And, I would like to make a request, indeed an offer.
    A few weeks ago, when I re-appeared on cypherpunks.org, I pointed out that my patent application was recently (mid-July 2013) published by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).  See       This is an invention that I thought of in December 2008, stuck in a prison cell at USP Tucson:  I realized that much of the index of refraction of ordinary silica (which is about 1.46; of that amount above an index of 1.000) was due to the presence of Si-29 atoms.  (Si-29 is the only naturally-existing silicon atom with an 'electromagnetic spin', due to its unpaired neutron circulating in the nucleus.)  I concluded that by dramatically reducing the proportion of Si-29 atoms, which amount to about 4.67% atom/atom in ordinary silicon, it would be possible to make silica with a much-lower index of refraction:   Probably between 1.10 and 1.02, but the amount is uncertain.
    One big advantage of this fiber will be a far-higher 'velocity factor', approaching 0.90-0.98 of 'c', where 'c' is physicist-speak for the speed of light in a vacuum, compared with ordinary silicon optical fibers with a velocity factor of 1/1.46, or 0.685 of 'c'.  This will amount to a dramatically-faster signal velocity.   While not quite as fast as line-of-sight microwave, or neutrino-beams piercing the earth, it would be significant.    Other advantages will be a
 reduction in optical loss by perhaps a factor of 10x (from perhaps 0.19 db/km in existing fibers to 0.019 db/km), a reduction of optical dispersion by a similar factor of 10x, and an increase in useable optical bandwidth from 50 nanometers wavelength (1510-1560 nm) to 800 nm (1000-1800 nm).  (The practical limit on fiber tends to be the limitation on the gain-bandwidth of EDFA's;  Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers     ).
    Shortly I will begin preparing a prototype for this fiber, which will cost between $200-250K.  (USD).  I have received a committment for this amount.  However, having filed for a US Patent (specifically, a PCT or 'Patent Cooperation Treaty' filing), it will be necessary to file for many dozens more 'national-stage' patents:  The way patents work, around the world, is that a person must file for a patent in each nation around the world that he desires to have patent-protection in.  A national-stage patent costs about $10,000.  Generally, the reasoning is that an inventor should file for a patent in any country:
1.    Where a significant amount of the invention will be made.
2.     Where a significant amount of the invention will be used.
    If I assume that the royalty per meter of fiber is $0.25/meter (25 American cents per meter), it would be worth filing for a patent if the amount of fiber made or used is $10,000/$0.25, or 40,000 meters of fiber.  This would be about 1.1 kilometers of cable that has 36 fibers in it.  Obviously, even the smallest country would use enough fiber to justify obtaining a patent.
    There are 148 PCT-signatory countries.        I would like to obtain, at the very least, national-stage patents in at least 40 nations, probably 80 nations, and possibly as much as 120 nations.  That would cost about $400,000, $800,000, or $1.2 million. (USD).   I have considered raising the money by means of a Kickstarter campaign, but that site is oriented to collecting donations of money:  It is specifically prohibited that a project proponent promise a financial return on such a contribution.  But I'm not looking for a handout:  I'm looking for a loan which will be paid back.   Perhaps that's called a 'bond'?     How would it be paid back?  Corning says that 300 billion meters of fiber were manufactured in about 2012.  If I get a market-share of 10%, that's 30 billion meters per year.  At a royalty of, say, $0.25 per meter of fiber, that would be $7.5 billion per year.  With even a tiny fraction of such a value, I could pay a huge return on a loan to finance these national-stage patent applications.  I see nothing wrong with a 3x return:   $3 returned for each dollar loaned, probably within 1-2 years.  Does this sound interesting?

 From: Peter Todd Sent: Tuesday, November 5, 2013 11:56 AM
 resources, there's a lot of
 intervention that can definitely stop
Not this exploit.
Here's a perfectly plausible worst-case scenario, that could be
happening right now: RAND High Frequency Trading Corp (a subsidiary of
General Evil) has a globe-spanning low-latency network of fiber,
line-of-sight microwave, and some experimental line-of-site neutrino
links criss-crossing the globe. They can get data to and from any point
on this planet faster than anyone else. Of course, in addition
 to their
spectacular network they have an immense amount of computing power, as
well as exotic overclocked liquid nitrogen bathed CPU's that run at
clockspeeds double what commercial
 hardware can do; in short, they have
access to scalar performance no-one else has. Of course, they like to
keep a healthy reserve so, 99% of all this fancy gear is constantly
idle. Whatever, they can afford it.
RAND just hired a bunch of fresh MIT graduates, the best of the best.
Problem is the best of the best tends to make not so best mistakes, so
RAND figures a Training Exercise is in order. Fortunately for them the NSA (a
subsidiary of General Evil) slipped a rootkit into my keyboard a week or
so ago - probably that time when I woke up in that farmers field with a
*splitting* headache - and are reading what I'm typing right now.
I go on to explain how an excellent training exercise for these fresh
MIT graduates would be to implement this nifty
 attack some Cornell
researchers came up with. It's really simple, elegant even, but to do it
best what you really want is the kind of low-latency network
 a
high-frequency-trading corporation would have. I then point out how a
good training exercise ideally is done in a scenario where there is
genuine risk and reward, but where the worst-case consequences are
manageable - new hires to tend to screw up. (I then go on to explain my
analog electronics background, and squeeze in some forced anecdote about
how I blew up something worth a lot of money owned by my employers at
some point in the distant past)
Unfortunately for the operators of BTC Guild, one of these new MIT grads
happens to have a: passed General Evil's psych screening with flying
colors, and b: have spent too much time around the MIT Kidnappng Club.
He decides it'd be easier to just kidnap the guy running BTC Guild than
fill out the
 paperwork to borrow RAND's FPGA cluster, so he does.
As expected the attack runs smoothly: with 30% of the hashing power,
neutrino burst generator/encoders's rigged
 around the globe to fire the
moment another pool gets a block, and the odd DoS attack for fun, they
quickly make a mockery of the Bitcoin network, reducing every other
miners profitability to zero in minutes. The other miners don't have a
hope: they're blocks have to travel the long way, along the surface of
the earth, while RAND's blocks shave off important milliseconds by
taking the direct route.
Of course, this doesn't go unnoticed, er, eventualy: 12 hours later the
operators of GHash.IO, Eligius, slush, Bitminter, Eclipse and ASICMiner
open their groggy eyes and mutter something about how that simulcast
Tuesday party really shouldn't have had an open bar... or so much coke.
They don't even notice that the team from BTC Guild
 has vanished, but
they do notice a YouTube video of Gavin right on bitcoin.org doing his
best Spock impression, er, I mean appealing for calm and promising that
Top Men are
 working on the issue of empty blocks as we speak. Meanwhile
CNN's top headline reads "IS THIS THE END OF BITCOIN?!?!"
It takes another hour for the Aspirin's to finally kick in, but
eventually get all get on IRC and start trying to resolve the issue -
seems that whenever any of them produce a block, somehow by incredible
coincidence someone else finds another block first. After a few rounds
of this they're getting suspicious. (if they weren't all so hung-over
they might have also found suspicious the fact that whenever they found
a block they saw a sudden blue flash - Cherenkov radiation emitted when
those neutrino's interacted with the vitreous humour in their eyeballs)
It's quickly realized that "somehow" BTC Guild isn't affected...
GHash.IO and
 Eligius, 22% and 13% of the hashing power respectively,
decide to try a little experiment: they peer to each other and only each
other through an encrypted tunnel
 and... hey, no more lucky blocks!
slush, 7% of the hashing power is invited to the peering group next,
followed by Bitminter, 6%, and Eclipse, 2%, and finally ASICMiner, 1%,
for a grand total of... 51% of the hashing power!
Of course, just creating blocks isn't useful for users, they need to be
distributed too, so someone quickly writes up a "one-way firewall" patch
that allows the group's blocks to propagate to the rest of the network.
Blocks created by anyone else are ignored.
It takes a few more hours, but eventually the attacker seems to run out
of blocks, and transaction processing returns to normal, albeit a little
slow. (20 min block average) Of course, soon there's a 3,000 post thread
on bitcointalk complaining about the "centralized pool
 cartel", but
somehow life goes on.
The next day Gavin goes on CNN, and gives a lovely interview about how
the past two days events show how the strength of
 the Bitcoin network is
in the community. For balance they interview this annoying "Peter Todd"
guy from "Keep Bitcoin Free!" who blathers on about how relying on
altruism or something will doom the Bitcoin network in the long run.
After the interview Gavin respectfully points out that maybe next time
they find a so called "developer" with a ratio of bitcointalk posts to
actual lines of code in the Bitcoin git repository better than one
hundred to one. The producer just wishes that "Mike Hearn" guy was
available; at least he's got a sense of fashion, sheesh!
Anyway, I'm out of space for my little story, but yeah, the ending
involves a group of now-rich pool operators who decide to start a large
financial services and data networking company, oh,
 and time-travel...
 discuss it.
Quite seriously, your attack is a serious long-term risk, but in the
short term the social dynamics of Bitcoin are such that it's just not a
show-stopping risk. At worst some miners will lose a bunch of money -
that's something that's happened before with the March chain fork, and
sure enough Bitcoin survived just fine.
You can hide *who* is the
 attacker - you can't hide the fact that an
attack is happening if done on a meaningful scale.
 carefully.
That's not what we're concerned about - what we're concerned about is
that your BIP doesn't discuss the issue, and you didn't seem to be aware
of it. That suggests that the analysis is incomplete. There's no
pressing need to rush changes, as explained above by example, so we're
best off understanding the issue thoroughly first.
There's a whole spectrum of potential solutions that haven't been
discussed - I myself have two approaches I'm working on that may solve
this problem in ways you
 haven't (publicly) considered. I'm sure there
are many others out there.

    I certainly don't disagree with your assertion that "the technical world is filled with literally millions of junk patents".  As early as the early 1970's, I made a comment to my father (a few years later, he applied for and received unrelated patent:     about news of a patented invention that didn't seem to qualify, probably for the "unobvious to those skilled in the art" qualification.  He commented that the Soviets had done a study of patents and declared that 4 out of 5 were 'patent noise':  They weren't actually worthy of patenting.  I didn't, and don't, disagree:  I agree that the large majority of patents aren't worthy of being granted.  And thus, they have all the negatives you cited.
    But that doesn't mean that no patents meet the commonly-accepted criteria of being "new, useful, and unobvious to those skilled in the art".  Further, perhaps I dare point out that one major plot element in Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged" book was "Rearden Metal" (identified as being an alloy of copper) and its patent, and how the US government extorted those patent rights from Rearden.  I don't want to be accused to "appealing to authority", a well-known flaw in argumentation, although Ayn Rand is a major authority.   And, I don't want to suggest that I am a Randian (a "Randroid"):  I learned in 1975 that I'd always been a libertarian, and I only first heard of the existence of Ayn Rand in 1976.  But I think it is by no means universally agreed (by libertarians) that some sort of patent system shouldn't exist.  Sure, it's a problem if that patent system is enforced solely by 'government', and someday this problem ought to be fixed.
      I fully agree that it would be better if there was some sort of voluntary-ist 'patent system'.  For example, a mark on a product (like circle-C for copyright, and "UL" for Underwriters Labs, etc) which identifies that the manufacturer complies with some voluntary patent system.  Companies (such as Telcos, Internet Co's, Costco, Walmart, etc) might announce and agree that they would only buy and sell goods and services which meet the voluntary-patent-system standards.  Under that situation, it might be rather difficult for non-patent-compliant items to be marketed.  We'd have the same system, but simply not government-enforced.
     You said:  " My threshold is if any strongly competent engineer can dream this idea up in a week when asked the same questions, its clearly a junk patent designed to sabotage and leach off other peoples productivity."     I certainly agree.  If all such improperly-granted patents weren't granted, that would solve 99% of the problem with the patent system.
    Regarding my invention:  On my release from prison December 19, 2009, I promptly used an online service (freepatentsonline.com) and discovered that there had been three patents granted on isotopically-modified optical-fibers.  Two granted to Corning in about 2004, (6810197  6870999) and one to Deutsche Telekom in about 2002  (   ).  For 30 minutes, I was afraid that they had scooped me, only to find that their inventions hadn't made the same isotopic changes that I had invented.     Keep in mind that I, having made my invention, am essentially obligated to employ the existing patent systems, until another one appears.  Otherwise, I lose whatever rights I might have in the future.       Jim Bell
 From: Adam Back Sent: In my opinion patents and copyright are incompatible with a free society and
crypto-anarchy: ie with the right to privately contract, and right to
cryptograhically enforced privacy (encryption), and freedom of association
(pseudonymous/anonymous networks).
You'd think Jim would get that given is previous explorations of the darker
side of Tim May's cyphernomicon catalog of ideas...
Patents are also stupidly destructive as the technical world is filled with
literally millions of junk patents, with redudant overlap, so you cant do
anything without tripping over 100s of junk patents.  Even the USG finally
started to try to belatedly reform the idiocy.
(Without any aspersions of the junk or non junk status of Jim's patent as I
am not a hardware guy).  My threshold is if any strongly competent engineer
can dream this idea up in a week when asked the same questions, its clearly
a junk patent designed to sabotage and leach off other peoples productivity.

Can we all agree that if a 'patent system' were implemented by 'voluntary-ist' methods, that doesn't involve government-initiated force, that would solve the problem:  Those that agreed with copyrights/patents would buy only from stores that specialize in copyright/patent-honoring products/manufacturers; others would buy from all stores, including those that sold non-copyright/patent-honoring products.

I think that a large part of the problem (even for libertarians such as myself) is that we have trouble imagining a non-statist solution to problems.  We are so used to the idea of a government doing things (even if done badly, or things that shouldn't be done at all) that it's difficult to construct a replacement that is consistent with libertarian principles.  I previously suggested that there could indeed be a voluntary-ist system to replace our existing patent system.  Yes, an ideal kind of this system would have to be far more selective in 'granting' (e.g., "approving") patents.  (perhaps only 20% of the current rate of granting would be allowed, possibly less.)   There might even be competing such 'patent'-certification organizations.  Stores might certify that they will buy only from companies that, themselves, certify that they do not violate any of the voluntary-ist patents.  Marks on the goods will announce those certifications. 
 Companies that manufacture such certified products might also certify that they will refuse to sell their products to stores that do not limit themselves to such certified products.     Any consideration of this kind of system will have to deal with the existing, status-quo (government managed) patent and copyright system.  Even if 80% of existing granted patents were improperly granted, that means that 20% are meritorious.  Now, I suppose that there might be some people who simply don't believe in any form of ownership of patents and/or copyrights.  But I suspect that most people would be willing to conform their buying to a voluntary system, IF frivolous patents are not granted, or they are subsequently 'un-granted' based on some sort of challenge mechanism.  And, if large stores decide to limit their stock to such conforming products, it might be somewhat difficult to market goods that are not conforming.
    I realize that such arrangements may be hard for us to imagine.  But soon enough, we might have little choice but to do that imagining.

Keep in mind that most of what I describe here will be in my 2003 lawsuit, 02-1052.  cryptome.org/jdb-v-usa-106.htm     I should point out that you don't seem to be commenting about my now-numerous emails to you about these attorneys.   What's the problem?  Are you AFRAID to comment?  I think it's unfair for you to wait until I have disclosed all this material, before you comment.      I really think I have a right to learn WHY you claimed that I had tried to fire 'every' attorney I'd had.  Where did you hear this?   You certainly never tried to verify this claim with me!   I would have told you the truth;  I would have directed you to lawsuit 02-1052, which already contained the truth.
Robert Leen:   (You might initially be pleased to hear that Leen was the first attorney I'd actually TRIED to 'fire'.  But don't get your hopes up!  I was entirely unsuccessful at that attempt.!)
      My next attorney was assigned about November 21, 2000.   I knew 'the fix was in' because I had done NOTHING illegal.  I didn't know about the forged, fake, fraudulent appeal case (99-30210), at least the portion of which was prior to May 2000  But I had very publicly announced that I had major, major suspicions about government government corruption, especially Ryan Thomas Lund's November 25, 1997 assault on me (ordered by government employees).  And, I knew that the government had placed a tracking device on my parents' car (probably both of them) in April-June 1998.  Also, I knew that the Feds had illegally searched my house on my arrest in June 1998.  (I had been removed from my house; the house was empty of  'cops'.  They had no authority to continue to search that house, yet they did so.  
      Robert Leen refused to try to obtain any 'discovery'  shortly after my arrest about November 20, 2000.  Recognizing that Leen was trying to sabotage my legal case, I wrote a letter to the Judge (Tanner) in about December 8, 2000, complaining that Leen was trying to sabotage my case.  I was astonished (at least in part) that the Judge refused to have Leen fired.  I kept asking for Leen to be fired throughout January, February, March, and beyond in 2001.   No (good) answer by the Judge.  I began learning the law in mid-December 2000.  Starting about late February 2001, I began to write various legal motions, in order to document my complete unwillingness to accept Leen's 'representation'.  (If you just look at the docket entries for case 00-5731, you may not be able to easily identify which motions were written by me, and which w
      To show your lawyer how corrupt the Judge (Tanner) and Leen, and the prosecutor (Robb London) were (case 00-5731), during the last week of March 2001, I filed a 'notice of interlocutory appeal'.  Your lawyer presumably understands that if a 'notice of appeal' arrives at court, of an appealable issue, that divests the jurisdiction of that court to proceed with any trial.  Wanna know what happened?  The judge PROCEEDED with a 'trial' as if nothing had happened.  I filed a SECOND notice of interlocutory appeal a few weeks before the 'sentencing', and again that filing was completely ignored.
       Robert Leen was NEVER 'fired'.  In fact, in May 2010 (after being arrested for an ostensible probation violation.)  Leen actually continued to (pretend to) 'represent me'.  Even until today, I presume, he is ostensibly still 'representing' me.  At least, on the paperwork he will be listed as 'representing' me.
    I should point out, also, that it was about this time (early in Leen's malicious 'representation' of me) that I first heard the wacky comment (by the prosecutor Robb London) of his resistance to having Leen replaced.  London said something LIKE "Bell fires all his attorneys".  By now, Mr. Greenberg, you are well aware that this isn't true.  You really need to find Robb London, and ask him if he ever said something like "Bell fires all his attorneys".  Perhaps London would defend himself by claiming that he looked into the court record, noticed that at various times the name of my lawyer had changed, and he decided this 'must have' meant that I succeeded (and, therefore, certainly tried) in replacing these attorneys.  Annemarie Levins
      I guess I'm getting tired of re-hashing what you could, and SHOULD, have read in my lawsuit, 02-1052, filed July 14, 2003.   Levins was assigned shortly after my ostensible 'conviction' in September 2001.  (The reason, as I vaguely recall, was that Robert Leen had stated, "I don't do appeals".   I responded by saying to Leen, in what was only about 25% intended as a joke, "You don't do appeals.  You merely make them necessary.")   Over the next 4-5 months I wrote Levins numerous letters, containing easily 100 pages of single-spaced text, listing HUNDREDS of very arguable appeal issues.  Levins, to my recollection, NEVER responded to even a single one of my letters!  An increasing sense of dread resulted.  I felt it was quite obvious that Levins was planning to further victimize me, in precisely the same way Avenia, Mandel, and Leen had done.  (Remember, I did not then yet know how Solovy had victimized me, by concealing the
 pre-May-2000 existence of appeal 99-30210.)
     As I vaguely recall (not referring to any record) my appeal had to be filed on a Monday, perhaps it was in January or February 2002.  At virtually the last minute, perhaps on a Thursday before,  I finally received a copy of "the appeal".  By that time, I had learned plenty of federal criminal and appeal law.  I saw the appeal that Levins had written, the one that she had CONCEALED from me for 4 months, and it was obvious that it was intended to sabotage my case.  Which, in fact, it did.  There were at least 100 incredibly valid appeal issues which, if they had been argued properly, would have easily freed me, but Levins argued NONE of them.
    Perhaps the day later, maybe it was Friday, the weekday before the appeal had to be filed, I obtained a telephone call to Levins.  In that call, I accused Levins of deliberately sabotaging my case, saying that her failure to even respond to my 100+ pages of letters proved that she was a crook.  She didn't deny it!  When it was clear that Levins wasn't going to apologize, I ORDERED her to NOT file that appeal.  I told her, "You're fired!  You must not file that appeal!  And if you're already filed it, I order you to withdraw it!!!".     Strong words, but quite appropriate under the circumstances.   The result?  She DIDN'T resign.  She filed the appeal.  She DIDN'T have it withdrawn.  The appeal lost, as I knew it would.
    Mr. Greenberg, you should be utterly and completely ashamed for what you have done.  You have thoroughly and completely misrepresented virtually every fact, implication, and nuance relating to me and my legal cases, and virtually everything I said/wrote to you.  You LIED by claiming of your lawyer, "She read Bell's letter, then checked his legal file, which showed that he had fired practically every court-appointed lawyer ever assigned to him---little wonder that he had botched his appeals.  It also showed he had filed fifty-one lawsuits against the government while in prison---nearly all dismissed immediately.  She wanted nothing to do with it."
    Mr. Greenberg, your lawyer is totally incompetent to have said ANY of these things.  I have made perfectly clear in my recent set of emails to you:
1.    You never verified any of these supposed 'facts', when in fact you had access to my 02-1052 lawsuit which would have told you the truth.
2.     I never was SUCCESSFUL at firing ANY attorney assigned to my case.
3.     I never ATTEMPTED to fire Avenia, Mandel,  Floit, Bukey, and Solovy.
4.     When, finally, I did begin to ATTEMPT to fire an attorney, Leen, I was entirely unsuccessful, indeed for a period of 9 years.
5.     When I did ATTEMPT to fire Annemarie Levins, and ordered her to NOT file that appeal, I was completely unsuccessful in that attempt.
6.      I did not file "Fifty-one lawsuits against the government".   As I have already explained to you, I DID file well over 100 "habeas corpus" actions, which your lawyer was apparently unable to distinguish from 'lawsuits'.  But since your lawyer probably didn't even bother to do anymore than read the dockets for some of these cases, it is perfectly obvious that she had no genuine idea why these habeas corpus actions were "dismissed immediately".  In other words, she (presumably) didn't know whether those dismissals were 'genuine', or whether the dismissals were entirely frivolous.  I can assure you that these dismissals were entirely frivolous.  But, you didn't check my side of the story, because YOU DIDN'T ASK ME!  That's called "bias".
7.     _I_ never "botched any appeals".  The appeals, to the extent they were 'botched', were 'botched' by the attorneys who were assigned to me, and (I claim) were actually assigned for the PURPOSE of 'botching' those appeals.
    Mr. Greenberg, at this point you have an obligation, not merely to APOLOGIZE, but in fact to set the record straight.  And I mean, not only in future editions of your book, but also to investigate the reality of the facts of the case.  After all of the victimization I faced at the hands of the government and its thugs, you come along and make the situation worse!  You try to make me look like a nut, when the reality is precisely as I have long claimed:  I am the victim of the Federal government and its employees and agents.  At no time did I lie or misrepresent the truth.  At EVERY time the Federal government and its agents misrepresent the truth.
     Mr. Greenberg, I have decided to publish the contents of this email in the Cypherpunks mailing list, to show that I have put you on notice as to your complicity in this matter.  You can fix part of the problem by changing your book, and by writing a long article for Forbes telling (at least) how you claim to have been hoodwinked by the Federal Government.  Morally, that will help a bit, but it won't change the fact that you were utterly unwilling to pursue the truth when it mattered most.

Mr. Greenberg,
    This is further commentary about your
 claim that I fired 'every' attorney I was assigned.  That, as I previously stated, was and is laughably incorrect.
      Please see Claims 130 through 145, in my July 2003 Lawsuit, "James Dalton Bell et al v. District Courts of Tacoma and Seattle, et al", case number 02-1052, as amended on about July 14, 2003, for what I mentioned in my previous message, copied below.   It's available on the Web, at:      cryptome.org/jdb-v-usa-106.htm    See, further, Claims 146-161, describing how
 attorney Judith Mandel was forced onto me.  Strictly speaking, I didn't try to 'fire' Mandel:  More accurately, I tried to prevent Mandel from being inflicted onto me, although I was unsuccessful.  Mandel actually REQUESTED to withdraw, on about June 2, 1999   (See my Claim 158 in Lawsuit 02-1052).
    You will notice very few references to forged, fraudulent 9th Circuit Court of Appeal case 99-30210 in my lawsuit.  The reason is that I was having another person edit this lawsuit, in the Portland Oregon area, and I only discovered the pre-April-2000 existence of case 99-30210 in about June 20, 2003.   That lawsuit had been originally filed in about July 2002, and there was a 1-year limitation period on my amending that lawsuit, in order to obtain the benefit of the earlier (2002) filing date.  Thus, I had very little time in which to do those edits:  I had to write a very
 few such edits, mail them to the person doing the edits in the Portland area, where he made those edits, and then have copies of the amendment printed up and filed at Portland Oregon Federal Court.
      It was, I believe, Judith Mandel who filed the one-page "Notice of Appeal" (About June 20, 1999) for my probation-revocation case in Tacoma Federal Court. (And she resigned about June 21, 1999).   But she never sent me a copy of that notice.  Of course, I didn't know that at the time.  (And she never mailed to me a copy of her file on my case, which she should have done if she had been going to 'allow' me to defend myself in any subsequent appeal.)   Even that wouldn't have been a problem, EXCEPT that all of the mailings subsequently done by the Ninth Circuit Court of appeals (or should have been done?) were never delivered to me:  First, at my address at Seatac Federal Detention
 Center (FDC), until about Sept 3, 1999, and subsequently (beginning about Sept  10, 1999) at Phoenix FCI.   The only plausible explanation for this combination is that there was careful collusion between Mandel, the Tacoma Federal Court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the staff of Seatac FDC and (later) Phoexnix FCI.  If even ONE of the mailings that I should have gotten from the Ninth Circuit Court had actually arrived and had been delivered to me, I would have been aware of the existence of that appeal, case 99-30210.
    My recollection is that in April 2000, I wrote a letter to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, still unaware of the existence of case 99-30210.  I demanded an appeal on my probation-revocation case.  (I had been told, by a jailhouse-lawyer, in early 2000 that I had a right to an appeal.)   What I didn't know (because I didn't know the law at that point)
 that in order to obtain an appeal, I would have had to have filed a "Notice of Appeal" within two weeks after the entry of the order:  About June 1999.  So, if I had know the rules, I would not have written that letter, because I would have realized that I was about 10 months too late.  But, the reality is that the appeal ALREADY EXISTED, though I didn't know that at the time.   In fact, I only learned in June 2003 that case 99-30210 had existed as early as July 1999.
    So, you can see that I DIDN'T even attempt to fire attorney Judith Mandel.  So, why did you say I fired her?  Why did you say I fired her predecessor, Peter Avenia?  I think by now you're getting a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach, but it's going to get worse, much worse!  I will continue to show that I did not SUCCEED in firing ANY attorney, and that in all cases those attorneys continued to
 victimize me until the damage they could do was done.  Then, on their own initiative (and with the approval of a colluding judge), they left.

    In 1978, I visited the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC for the first (and so far, only) time.  They had a display of "quack medical devices", that included a high-voltage AC device attached to glowing neon-bulb-type tubes.  The idea was that these tubes would be pressed against a person's flesh, thus capacitively coupled through the glass, including a glowing light within the tube,  and inducing a mild electrical current.  At the time, I accepted the idea that this was, indeed, an example of a "quack medical device".
   In 1996, I began work at a Vancouver Washington contract-electronic-design/manufacturer firm.  One of the major products that this company made were "TENS" devices.  (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulators      ).   They were/are intended to reduce chronic pain.  They worked in pretty much the same way that those "quack" early 1900's devices worked:  Cause a AC small current to flow within flesh.  What was thought to be 'quack' in 1978, turned out to not be 'quack' at all!

BTW, I'm not accusing this material of being 'spam', the way some of my posts on Cypherpunks are being labeled by a few.  In fact, I really think this kind of thing should be posted here. (cypherpunks at cpunks.org).   But, other than the fact that Silk Road used Tor, and thus onion routing, why would my situation and cases be any less appropriate of comment than Ulbricht's situation?   I realize that there are probably going to be some pro-government shills who simply don't like what I did, and some of them have and will continue to speak up.  But we should all be willing to pay attention to the illegal means with which government(s) promotes its interests.  Particularly with Snowden's massively-important disclosures about the USG's clearly-illegal surveillance activities, it is quite clear that the Federal government has decided to treat these kinds of disputes as if they were a 'war', and to use war-like tactics on civilians.  I fully expect that similar illegal activities will be used against this 'Sanjuro' guy.   Google 'Assassination Market Sanjuro'.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Defense Fund Launched for Ross Ulbricht, Accused Silk Road Marketplace Operator
New York, NY, November 20, 2013 – The family of the man accused by the US government of operating the Silk Road online marketplace has launched a fund for donations to their son's legal defense.
Ross Ulbricht, 29, was arrested on October 1st and charged with creating and operating the web marketplace Silk Road, under the pseudonym “Dread Pirate Roberts”. The allegations include a variety of conspiracies, including narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering, as well as planned acts of violence. Ulbricht denied all charges in federal court in San Francisco in October. He will appear at a bail hearing at the United States District Court, Southern District of New York at 11:00 am EST on Thursday, November 21.
On their website, the Ulbricht family states: “Our goal is to provide Ross with what every American citizen is promised: a fair trial. In the USA we are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. We firmly believe in Ross’s innocence and are working hard with the best legal team to prove it.”
The family has retained New York-based attorney Joshua L. Dratel to defend their son in court. Mr. Dratel stated: “It is crucial that we have a level playing field for defending Ross, and that requires resources from the communities that support him.”
The Ross Ulbricht Legal Defense Fund LLC is a Wyoming-based corporation established by the Ulbricht family. All donations are used solely to pay attorney fees, fund accounting fees and ancillary legal expenses.

Please understand that I wasn't picking on your item.  I had seen a bunch of flack in the last few days, from people who should have known better, braying about my postings concerning government misbehavior.  I knew that nobody would object to your posting (quite correctly!), and I took the opportunity to compare these two examples.  The peanut-gallery needs to learn that the Cypherpunks list covers not merely encryption, but issues somewhat collateral (including political) to that matter.  The reason the 'shills' object to _my_ commentary concerning my history is that there is no longer any upside for the government, and in fact there is potentially a huge downside due to past government corruption that has virtually never been covered here.  (to my knowledge; until March 2012 I lived in a 'gated community'.  )  In contrast, as of right now in the Ross Ulbricht situation, the government can 'ride in on a white horse', pretending to save
 the day from evil drug-dealers.  No downside for the government (at least not yet), and so the shills remain quiet.

I haven't read enough of the 'AM' system to know what that system would do, but it seems to me that a logical outcome would be to split the reward based on the size of the contribution included with each prediction.  For instance, if Person A correctly predicted with 1 BTC, and Person B correctly predicted with 9 BTC, Person 1 should get 10% of the reward, while Person B should get 90%.
Incidentally, one problem I see with Sanjuro's 'AM' (Assassination Market) system (at least, so far) is the setting of a minimum bet at 1.0 BTC, which is about $800 when I checked a few seconds ago.  In writing my AP essay, I anticipated that very small bets (say, 10 cents US) would be allowed.  Except in unusual situations, few people would want to donate $800 (USD) to see somebody dead; Far more would be willing to donate $1 (USD) for that.
I don't know if the current minimum bid in 'AM' has something to do with the granularity of 1.0 BTC, but the existence of digits to the right of the decimal point in the prediction totalizations suggests that this is not the case.   If the problem is that the prediction totalization is currently being done manually, rather than automatically, that is a limitation that I think must be fixed in order for 'AM' to operate well.  And with a minimum bet of 1.0 BTC, it might be portrayed as if 'AM' is a tool of the wealthy, rather than that of the average person.
To the extent that this is a problem now, it will be worse as Bitcoin continues to deflate (increase in value) as it was no doubt intended to do.  What happens when 1 BTC = $10,000?   I consider that one of the few disadvantages or problems with Bitcoin is its hyper-deflationary nature:  How can a currency function as a currency, if it is 'scheduled' (by algorithm) to appreciate in value far faster than any commodity?  Another related problem is that Bitcoin is effectively programmed to excessively reward early-adopters.  While I feel that the inventor of Bitcoin should be richly rewarded for doing the work necessary to give us such a beneficial addition to society, the limit of my generosity is about $1 billion (USD).  Ultimately, I think that a replacement for Bitcoin ("Bitcoin 2.0"?) is necessary, one that won't appreciate in value more than, say, 5% per year.

I don't agree with your statement, "Bitcoin is only deflationary because the number of people who use it is growing faster than the number of coins in circulation.".   To the contrary, my understanding is that a number of factors have combined with the net result that Bitcoin is hyper-deflationary.  One major factor has been the shift of bitcoin 'mining' from computer CPUs, to video graphics processors (GPU's), to FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), and ultimately ASICs (literally, "application-specific integrated circuits"; what used to be called 'custom' IC's decades ago.)  While I don't have a specific number, I would not be surprised to hear that an ASIC miner is 1000x faster than even the fastest x86 CPU.  If that were the only factor, it would appear that new bitcoins should be 1000x more available than in, say, 2009.  However, I also understand that the 'difficulty' of mining bitcoin has been algorithmically increased regularly, in order
 to make it more difficult to compute to find individual bitcoins.   This is programmed into the entire bitcoin system.  In fact, it is to the point where the limiting factor to the cost of 'mining' bitcoin is the electricity cost of running the machines, not the cost of the machines themselves.  The bitcoin system 'programs' the appreciation of bitcoin by gradually increasing the difficulty of that mining operation.  This translates into an increase in the market value of bitcoin.
In fact, this is essential to the (theoretical) outcome of bitcoin.  I think of it this way:  The system is programmed to only allow the generation of 21 million bitcoins.  If bitcoin is ultimately to be used to run the entire world economy (why not?) there should be at least one million times more.  (Say, 21 TRILLION; 21,000,000,000,000 bitcoins, if we think of the ultimate value of a bitcoin as being roughly equal to the current value of the US dollar, the Euro, the British Pound, etc.)  But since they are limited to 21 million, by algorithm, the value of a 2013 bitcoin will have to be increased by a factor of 1000  to stretch to the task of funding a world's market.  And that means that the 2 million BTC currently in the wallet most likely owned by Satoshi will presumably increase in value to $2 trillion  (USD).  "Nice work if you can get it".
Is this a problem?  Who, instead, would claim that it ISN'T a problem!  Bitcoin has many great features, its possibility (through Zerocoin) of being anonymous one of the most intriguing,  but there is nothing about a digital currency that requires that it deflates at the rate historically associated with bitcoin.  I view this deflation as being arbitrary and capricious, and wildly too large.  Like I've said, I don't begrudge Satoshi $1 billion (USD), but I DO begrudge him $2 trillion.  If Satoshi's bitcoin rescues us from all governments (enabling 'AM'), perhaps he should be entitled to $10 billion (USD), but not $2 trillion (USC).

How do you think something like that could be managed?
Bitcoin is only deflationary because the number of people who use it is growing faster than the number of coins in circulation. But how can you measure the number of people who are using it, and how can you measure how much they are using it? (IE are they speculating, are they actually using it to hide money from their government, are they buying needs like food+water?).
Any cryptocurrency hoping to 'appreciate by at most 5%' has to have some reliable metric for measuring it's value in the real world. Otherwise coin generation algorithms are just a shot in the dark, hoping to mimic the expected growth of the coin or having some authority that can provide input about it's real dollar value. And anything that tries to get insider metrics will need some defence against liars and sybil attacks.

Well, I don't see how I've "validated [your] statement".  You said the ONLY reason bitcoin is deflationary "because the number of people who use it is growing faster than the number of coins in circulation".   I'd say, to the contrary, that the limitation on the circulation of BTC is 'baked into the cake' of bitcoin itself:  It is algorithmically determined by the 'policy' built into the design of bitcoin.  That limitation on bitcoin was set long ago, long before most people understood what bitcoin was (secretly) intended to do.  And, since the 'cost' of mining yet another bitcoin is automatically adjusted, to greatly increase over the lifetime of the mining of bitcoin, 'blame' for the deflation should be assigned to the person who designed the algorithms.
I think at this point 'we' (the public; or at least the experts on bitcoin) understand that in principle, it would be possible to 'design' a new digital currency, call it "Bitcoin 2.0", which is specifically designed to not appreciate (nor depreciate) dramatically.  Part of the advantage they will have is that it won't be necessary to compensate for ease-of-mining represented by the transition through the CPU/GPU/FPGA/ASIC eras:  Everybody will 'start' with a level playing field, ASIC's.  The number of 'Bitcoin 2.0's could be set to approximately 20 trillion, if it is limited at all, and there will be no dramatic increases in the 'difficulty' of mining them, over the lifetime of the mining.  Because the difficulty will not appreciably increase, their value will also not appreciably increase.  It would certainly not increase so much so as to dissuade people from spending them.

You've validated my statement.
Your problem is if bitcoin becomes a world economy. That means bitcoins usage grows by something like 2 orders of magnitude. Except that bitcoins are already halfway mined, which means that the circulation will not keep up. That is what drives the price up.
If you want a currency that will scale with it's global usage (IE when the market cap hits $21 trillion, there are 21 trillion in circulation), you need some mechanism that knows how to equate 1 bitcoin to 1 dollar, that way more bitcoins can be printed as the market cap goes up.

The use of CPU 'effort' as 'earning' bitcoins (or other electronic currency) was a good idea.  Problem is, there's plenty of electricity being wasted in the process.  It seems to me that it should be possible to develop some sort of use for this dedicated CPU effort.  What's a major use of CPU power?  One is weather forecasting, another is simulations of various kinds.  These use huge amounts of computer-time, and if they are made to be sufficiently divisible people could earn digital-coin by doing things that are actually valuable in and of themselves.

Bitcoin has a lot of problems.
Andy, the problem isn't the denomination, the problem is that Satioshi has 5% of all the currency, and the Winklevoss twins have another 0.5%. If bitcoin becomes worth 100 trillion dollars, they've got a solid 500 billion for being nobody and doing nothing. That's a problem to me.
Another problem with bitcoin is that the blockchain won't scale. Another problem is that nobody knows how to price transaction fees. And then there's the selfish mining problem.
I think though that we'll see other cryptocurrencies that solve these problems. Bitcoin is overinflated, and while the current alt coins aren't offering much in the way of competition.
I'm working on one right now. It's not built but the idea is to use proof-of-contribution instead of proof-of-work, where contribution is disk storage contributed to a distributed network. The disk storage is used to house the blockchain, but it can also be sold on a market for people to use. Theoretically, this gives people a way to price the currency (using the value of cloud storage vs. the price of storage on the network using the network currency).
The tricky part is preventing cheating, but I think I have a decent solution.
I don't however know a good way to distribute currency to the network, for the problems I was explaining to Jim Bell. Storage is currently getting cheaper at an exponential rate, and I have no idea how to predict the volume of users over time, nor a good way to measure the volume of users as immune to sybil attacks. How do you prevent the early adopters from becoming stupid wealthy if the currency takes off?

I certainly agree with 'high risk, high reward'.  But that begs the question of, 'how much risk v. how much reward?'.  I've already said that I fully agree that Satoshi should get $1 billion for what he's done.  (More, if BTC fully enables a system like Sanjuro's 'AM').  But, he's getting close to that level now, and everything I understand about bitcoin is that he isn't going to sell his BTC's, so he will get far more than that over the next few years.  _THAT_ level of 'reward' is absolutely uncalled-for, and I think when the public learns of that, there will be a great deal of anger.  If such a payoff were absolutely necessary to launch bitcoin, and there were no alternatives, I'd grudgingly say "yes".  But, I can imagine a digital currency with far-less early-adopter bias.  This is particularly true today:  We all know that the world needs something like BTC.  At this point, how much real 'risk' would there be in a new digital currency? 
 Far less than BTC.

I've found the problematic passage in Satoshi's paper.  From Section 4, 'Proof of Work':
       "To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time,the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour.  If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases."
So I ask, "What is 'too fast'?"  What it means is that the algorithm tries to limit the rate of creation of bitcoins to a relatively constant value.  At the time most people first read that paper, this might not have appeared like it was going to foment a problem.  But, it should have been obvious to Satoshi that the adoption of a new digital currency isn't a linear process:  Particularly in the early stages I would have anticipated that 'demand' for BTC would be some approximation of the square of the elapsed time, rather than the elapsed time.   One user would likely 'create' other users at a relatively constant rate, meaning that the integral of xdx is (x**2).   (disregarding the 1/2 factor...).    To limit the creation of bitcoins to a linear value amounts to throttling its potential, and that means a pressure for the value to go up, way up.  That's great for the early adopters, whose early work is made far more valuable than it otherwise
 would have been.  Doubtless Satoshi understood this.  Doubtless Satoshi also understood how important it was for him to get together  as much computing power as he could afford, at the beginning, because CPU power at that point was quite sufficient to mine bitcoin.         Jim Bell

As I was telling Jayvan, the idea would be that early adopters use the currency for its inherent uses to them, as opposed to its speculative potential.
Right now, bitcoin is almost exclusively speculative. It's worth a lot of money because the value has been increasing consistently. That's tulipmania.
In a perfect world you would have some way to protect a currency against speculation. The volatility in bitcoin makes it less useful as a currency, therefore the speculation is damaging bitcoin.
I don't have a solution, and I'm not suggesting one, I'm merely suggesting that a solution might exist that would be a substantial improvement.
If bitcoin was based on something that had inherent value, say cloud storage, then a spike in value would be followed by a spike in the amount of storage being contributed to the network (bitcoin currently does this, a spike in price is followed by a spike in mining). The key here though is that the network would be protect from dramatic dips in value. When bitcoin drops in price, all of the abundant mining does nothing to save bitcoin, because the bitcoin mining doesn't actually add any value to the network. Nobody cares how many petaflops the network is pulling, because the petaflops can't be put to use somewhere else.
But if the mining was based on cloud storage, a dramatic drop in the price of the currency would result in a dramatic drop in the cost of storing data on the network. That's something that actually has use, and so people would let the price fall unreasonably low (instead they would find a way to make use of the cheap storage). This would allow the currency to ride arbitrary spikes in price while being protected against arbitrary drops in price.
Jim, the amount of mining being done on the bitcoin network has no impact on the price. The price might have an impact on the volume of mining, but because the mining is specific to the bitcoin network (double sha2 hashing or something like that) it can't be sold or used for other applications. Bitcoin mining is only good for bitcoin mining, which means the demand for the mining is exclusively based on value of the bitcoins being mined every day.

Look what has happened to Bill Clinton after leaving office.  It's said he's worth $100 million  (In USD, presumably).  Mostly this comes in the form of 'speaking fees':  As much as $700 in Nigeria. This is not-so-thinly-disguised bribery. One solution that would slow him down would be a 95% tax rate on an ex-president's income, at least that above $400,000 per year.  I prefer that politicians not exist.  Ideally, deter them from becoming politicians in the first place, of if that doesn't work, reward others for taking them out of office.
Your statement makes no sense.  "Killing politicians for unaccounted wielding of power doesn't deter"?  It's hard to imagine that it WOULDN'T deter that!  It would certainly prevent that, at least future such exercises of power, by the target...er...person in question.
You also seem to disregard the idea that such a system would deter people from entering politics, at least those with the intention of being corrupt.  (Full disclosure:  I view 'politics' as being _inherently_ 'corrupt', being a libertarian.)
How often does that actually work?   The people in power, the ones actually making the rules, have every incentive to try to make prosecutions of that kind as rare as possible.  And there are countries in which prosecution of the political opposition is virtually a national sport, such as Russia.  I think your proposed 'solution' simply isn't a solution at all.  At least, it hasn't worked yet, and there is no prospect for it working in the future, anywhere.

Oh, non-perceptive one, I seek to enlighten you.  While the payment for bribery normally is thought of as occurring _before_ (or during) the payback desired, as a practical matter it isn't very practical to bribe an American president while he is in office.  But since the office of President will continue to exist, and the people who are inclined to get favors will continue to exist, and they all know this (see 'game theory'),  a logical solution is to delay the bribe payment until the office-holder is out of office.  Obviously, while a president may wonder what would motivate a briber to actually pay the bribe after he leaves office, the reality is (remember reality?) is that word of welshing will surely get back to the subsequent office-holder(s), poisoning the well for the almost-but-not-quite-briber in the future.  No doubt, for example, America's First Muslim President will pick up tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars doing the
 rubber-chicken circuit in the (Muslim) Middle-east.  Do you wonder why Obama hasn't 'jawboned' the Arab oil producers to drop oil prices to, say, $60 per barrel?  Do you wonder why he hasn't made more threats to open up the spigots of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve?  Or why he hasn't approved the construction of the Keystone oil pipeline?  That's right:  Obama is carrying-water for the very people he expects to be bribed by about 3.5 years hence.         Jim Bell

 the amount he could reasonably have expected to 'earn' would have been very different.  Bitcoin should have been harder to 'mine' at the beginning than it was; Bitcoin should be easier to 'mine' now than it actually is.  I think that it is the ratio of these difficulties which define how much advantage an early-adopter has had over those who came later.  This difference is not defined by a law of nature, it is defined by algorithm and software.  And I strongly doubt that many people (other than Satoshi) realized this in 2009.

I can think of another "bad thing with Bitcoin" that hasn't yet been implemented.  So, I don't think this is "good news for those that own Bitcoin", quite the opposite.  If this prosecution is considered legitimate, could the next step be the prosecution of any persons who have anything to do with Bitcoin?  Buy it, go to jail.  Mine it, go to jail.  Keep it, go to jail. Offer it, go to jail.  Spend it, go to jail. Receive it, go to jail.  If this guy is being prosecuted, even in part, because others are using Bitcoin for illegal purposes, why aren't 'you' (term used generically) who own even one BTC, guilty of the same 'conspiracy'?  What is needed here is a mechanism to very strongly deter any such anti-bitcoin prosecutions.  (You can imagine what I'm thinking of...).  Separately, and somewhat less controversially, would be a mechanism to implement a 'denial of service attack' on court systems.   What if, for example, the Feds were no longer able to prosecute 70,000 people per year (the current figure, approximately), but instead were limited to, say, 5,000 per year?

"INJUSTICE: DENIAL of DISSERVICE ATTACK"
or, "How to really mess up the opponent, and to do so legally"           By Jim Bell, Author of 'Assassination Politics'.
     I spent well over 13 years in prison, and not only was I not guilty of nearly all of the crimes of which I was charged, I was actually a victim of crimes committed by various Federal government employees.  Not only was I assaulted on November 25, 1997 by a government stooge and informant, Ryan Thomas Lund, in order to force me to accept a plea agreement in case 97-5270, Tacoma Federal Court, I was also the victim of an amazing forged (falsified; fictitious; fake) appeal case (Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, case 99-30210) that was initiated by corrupt government and court employees, and whose pre-April-2000 existence was concealed from me until about June 2003.  Naturally, I concluded that something must be done about this.      The current population of United States Federal prisons is approximately 220,000 inmates.  (In 1980, that population was about 20,000).  Each year, somewhat more than 70,000 new defendants are charged, and the large majority (perhaps 95%) are convicted.  Yet, you might be surprised:  There are only about 3,500 Federal criminal jury trials in America each year.  The reason for the apparent difference is that in the vast majority of such cases, the defendant or defendants accept a plea agreement, which the news media wrongly refers to as a 'plea bargain':  In reality, it's not a 'bargain' for the criminal defendant, and it certainly isn't a 'bargain' for the American taxpayer.  See the "Prisoner's Dilemma".   It's actually a financial disaster of the first magnitude, one which the majority of the American population doesn't know about, and certainly doesn't understand.  But the reason the defendants are motivated to accept those deals is
 simple:  The Feds threaten them with time far greater than what they'll get if they deal.  So, the very large majority of them deal.  And so, all of us are poorer as a consequence.  The average sentence, we can calculate, is 220,000/70,000, or a bit over 3 years per sentence.  (This is one way to calculate an 'average sentence', there may be others.)
    It costs approximately $35,000 to keep a prisoner in Federal prison for one year.  So, for the 220,000 current prisoners, that's a total cost of about $7.7 billion dollars.  If that population could be brought down to the level it was in 1980, or 20,000 prisoners, about $7 billion dollars would be saved.   Even better, it would be far harder to extort people, people such as Barrett Brown (journalist), Kim Dotcom (Megaupload),  Bradley Manning (Cablegate), Ladar Levinson (operator of Lavabit), Edward Snowden (NSA leaker), Ty Warner (Beanie Babies, just convicted of tax evasion) or (now) Ross William Ulbricht, alleged operator of 'Silk Road'.   And, of course, thousands more that are less well-known.   Many of these people have either not committed any crime at all, or even if guilty of something, they shouldn't be punished to the extent the system would want to do.  Or punished at all.
    I was pondering this problem in my prison cell one day, and I got yet one more of my 'awfully wonderful, wonderfully awful' ideas.  (Quote from:  "How the Grinch Stole Christmas")  I was almost as energized, and as enthusiastic, as I was in early 1995, when I got the idea that I later turned into my "Assassination Politics" essay.   I thought, what if every Federal defendant could be motivated to refuse to deal, to refuse to accept the deal that's usuallyoffered.  The figure of$5,000 popped into my head.  What if every Federal felony criminal defendant were offered money, let's say $5,000, if they would plead not-guilty (which is their Constitutional right) and to demand a jury trial (which is also their Constitutional right).  The current system has trouble putting on 3,500 Federal felony criminal jury trials per year.  How would that system increase that number significantly?  The number of Federal courtrooms is somewhat fixed, the
 number of U.S. Attorneys is rather limited as well.  And, Federal court time has to be shared with civil cases, too.  So, it would be hard to imagine a great increase in the number of Federal criminal jury trials held.  If the number of persons convicted could be dropped from 70,000 per year to 4,000 per year, that should save the American taxpayers well over $7 billion per year in prison and jail costs.  Well over 90% of Federal prisons would have to shut within 5 years.
    How much would this cost?  Well, assuming a cost-per-offer of $5,000, and perhaps 4,000 trials per year, the cost would be $20 million per year.  For an individual, that's a lot of money.  But for an entire country, that's peanuts.   Yet, it would save the nation $7 billion.  In other words, for every dollar offered to a criminal defendant, the savings to the public would be:    $7 billion/$20 million = $350.     These estimates are not set in stone.  Of course, under this kind of pressure 'the system' would tend to allocate its resources, the limited number of courtroom-days available, and would probably select only the most serious cases for prosecution.  So, while it's possible that some residual amount of plea-bargaining would remain, this same pressure would tend to force officials to accept that defendants serve smaller average sentences than they've been getting, which of course are already much lower than they'd probably like to get.  Even if the resulting average sentence rose to 4 years, the overall population of Federal prisons would drop from 220,000 to about 16,000.  (4 years x 4,000 trials/year).  This would be a great improvement.         The big question is, "Who would pay for this?".  "Therein lies the rub", to quote Hamlet.  Don't expect bigtime drug-dealers to donate:  Their ability to make money would be thwarted if their products were rendered de-facto legal.   However, illegal-drug users would be greatly benefited.  The price of their favorite pastime might very well drop by a factor of 5-10, if the likelihood of getting arrested and charged with providing it was drastically lowered.  That would surely occur if this system was expanded to include state jurisdiction, which is about 10x larger than the Federal system, and thus a cost 10x higher:  $200 million per year..  Another group of people who would benefit would be tax-evaders.  The Wikipedia article on "Tax Evasion in the United States" indicates that the approximate money 'lost' (and thereby gained by non-payers) is $305 billion in 2010.  If only 1/100 of a penny foreach dollar thus saved was paid into a
 fund, that would be $30.5 million, which would be plenty to make sure that Federal tax evasion would be extremely difficult to prosecute.  As well as every other Federal crime.  Most accountants would see that as a good investment, and should advise their clients accordingly.

    Companies like Verizon who are ordered to hand over "electronic copies" of metadata, passwords, and other material the government shouldn't get, should be convinced that they need to hand over that material in "electronic form":  In the form of PDF files, of text that has been randomly ordered by line, and 'printed out' in a 'cursive' font, but not one in which each character always appears to be the same.  Rather, each character will be pseudorandomly modified in order to simulate the variability of any person's written cursive, with overlapping characters.  This will be analogous to the "Captcha" system    , which is designed to be very difficult for a computer to convert back to ASCII or HTML text.  The text will therefore be eminently readable to humans (at least if you're old enough to have been taught cursive in school!), yet virtually impossible to return to the form they'd like to see. 
 (Alternatively, a similarly-variable Gothic script could be used, to add spice to the whole process.)

First, I am not aware that the CP list has ever been limited solely to something that can be strictly labelled as "cryptography".  Second: Fortunately, I just uploaded an item about Lavabit and its operator Levison.  Those of us who are truly interested in security (as opposed to those who merely pretend to be, and are actually shills of government) understand that his crypto strength is rather pointless if the operator of a trusted service can be strong-armed by a government.  What I've just invented is a method to make it about 18 times harder for the government to threaten somebody with prosecution for anything he might choose to do.  (Conviction rate going from 70,000 to 4,000 per year.)  But that should have been obvious to anybody.  Why wasn't it obvious to you?

This is why that a system such as my "Denial of Disservice Attack" idea could be so attractive to corporate America and its high-level (and not so high level) employees.    If it were explained to them that it is in their interest to lower the Federal prison population from 220,000 to 15,000, and that it could be done for perhaps only $20 million per year,  they should flock to contribute.  It could be arranged as a charitable contribution ('to encourage employment of the jury system',) and thus be tax-deductible.           Jim Bell

    A few days ago, I floated this idea on the Cypherpunks email list.  (cypherpunks at cpunks.org).  I think many of the readers of Forbes magazine would be interested in this service.  Look up the name, Joseph Nacchio,  a CEO who was a victim of the NSA demands on his company (QWEST) 12 years prior to Edward Snowden's recent leaks on the subject.  Below, I suggest that for an approximate $20 million investment per year, the number of federal criminal convictions the government can get can be forced down from 70,000 to about 16,000 per year.   Think of the benefits for insider-traders, tax-evaders and such.  What about Ladar Levison, operator of 'Lavabit', who the government tried to force to reveal encryption keys? Your magazine, Forbes, could greatly assist if it ran, gratis, ads soliciting
 donations for a project leading from this idea.  Could companies like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Comcast, and many others be induced to donate a total of $20 million per year for this worthy concept?
    You may recall that in mid-2011, you contacted me and I informed you of that forged, fake, fraudulent appeal case, 99-30210, out of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  I wondered whether you would bother to do anything about that, and on cue, you did not.  I thought journalists considered it one of their jobs to reveal government corruption?

    "INJUSTICE: DENIAL of DISSERVICE ATTACK"
or, "How to really mess up the opponent, and to do so legally"           By Jim Bell, Author of 'Assassination Politics'.
     I spent well over 13 years in prison, and not only was I not guilty of nearly all of the crimes of which I was charged, I was actually a victim of crimes committed by various Federal government employees.  Not only was I assaulted on November 25, 1997 by a government stooge and informant, Ryan Thomas Lund, in order to force me to accept a plea agreement in case 97-5270, Tacoma Federal Court, I was also the victim of an amazing forged (falsified; fictitious; fake) appeal case (Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, case 99-30210) that was initiated by corrupt government and court employees, and whose pre-April-2000 existence was concealed from me until about June 2003.  Naturally, I concluded that something must be done about this.      The current population of United States Federal prisons is approximately 220,000 inmates.  (In 1980, that population was about 20,000).  Each year, somewhat more than 70,000 new defendants are charged, and the large majority (perhaps 95%) are convicted.  Yet, you might be surprised:  There are only about 3,500 Federal criminal jury trials in America each year.  The reason for the apparent difference is that in the vast majority of such cases, the defendant or defendants accept a plea agreement, which the news media wrongly refers to as a 'plea bargain':  In reality, it's not a 'bargain' for the criminal defendant, and it certainly isn't a 'bargain' for the American taxpayer.  See the "Prisoner's Dilemma".   It's actually a financial disaster of the first magnitude, one which the majority of the American population doesn't know about, and certainly doesn't understand.  But the reason the defendants are motivated to accept those deals is
 simple:  The Feds threaten them with time far greater than what they'll get if they deal.  So, the very large majority of them deal.  And so, all of us are poorer as a consequence.  The average sentence, we can calculate, is 220,000/70,000, or a bit over 3 years per sentence.  (This is one way to calculate an 'average sentence', there may be others.)
    It costs approximately $35,000 to keep a prisoner in Federal prison for one year.  So, for the 220,000 current prisoners, that's a total cost of about $7.7 billion dollars.  If that population could be brought down to the level it was in 1980, or 20,000 prisoners, about $7 billion dollars would be saved.   Even better, it would be far harder to extort people, people such as Barrett Brown (journalist), Kim Dotcom (Megaupload),  Bradley Manning (Cablegate), Ladar Levinson (operator of Lavabit), Edward Snowden (NSA leaker), Ty Warner (Beanie Babies, just convicted of tax evasion) or (now) Ross William Ulbricht, alleged operator of 'Silk Road'.   And, of course, thousands more that are less well-known.   Many of these people have either not committed any crime at all, or even if guilty of something, they shouldn't be punished to the extent the system would want to do.  Or punished at all.
    I was pondering this problem in my prison cell one day, and I got yet one more of my 'awfully wonderful, wonderfully awful' ideas.  (Quote from:  "How the Grinch Stole Christmas")  I was almost as energized, and as enthusiastic, as I was in early 1995, when I got the idea that I later turned into my "Assassination Politics" essay.   I thought, what if every Federal defendant could be motivated to refuse to deal, to refuse to accept the deal that's usually offered.  The figure of $5,000 popped into my head.  What if every Federal felony criminal defendant were offered money, let's say $5,000, if they would plead not-guilty (which is their Constitutional right) and to demand a jury trial (which is also their Constitutional right).  The current system has trouble putting on 3,500 Federal felony criminal jury trials per year.  How would that system increase that number significantly?  The number of Federal courtrooms is somewhat fixed, the
 number of U.S. Attorneys is rather limited as well.  And, Federal court time has to be shared with civil cases, too.  So, it would be hard to imagine a great increase in the number of Federal criminal jury trials held.  If the number of persons convicted could be dropped from 70,000 per year to 4,000 per year, that should save the American taxpayers well over $7 billion per year in prison and jail costs.  Well over 90% of Federal prisons would have to shut within 5 years.
    How much would this cost?  Well, assuming a cost-per-offer of $5,000, and perhaps 4,000 trials per year, the cost would be $20 million per year.  For an individual, that's a lot of money.  But for an entire country, that's peanuts.   Yet, it would save the nation $7 billion.  In other words, for every dollar offered to a criminal defendant, the savings to the public would be:    $7 billion/$20 million = $350.     These estimates are not set in stone.  Of course, under this kind of pressure 'the system' would tend to allocate its resources, the limited number of courtroom-days available, and would probably select only the most serious cases for prosecution.  So, while it's possible that some residual amount of plea-bargaining would remain, this same pressure would tend to force officials to accept that defendants serve smaller average sentences than they've been getting, which of course are already much lower than they'd probably like to get.  Even if the resulting average sentence rose to 4 years, the overall population of Federal prisons would drop from 220,000 to about 16,000.  (4 years x 4,000 trials/year).  This would be a great improvement.         The big question is, "Who would pay for this?".  "Therein lies the rub", to quote Hamlet.  Don't expect bigtime drug-dealers to donate:  Their ability to make money would be thwarted if their products were rendered de-facto legal.   However, illegal-drug users would be greatly benefited.  The price of their favorite pastime might very well drop by a factor of 5-10, if the likelihood of getting arrested and charged with providing it was drastically lowered.  That would surely occur if this system was expanded to include state jurisdiction, which is about 10x larger than the Federal system, and thus a cost 10x higher:  $200 million per year..  Another group of people who would benefit would be tax-evaders.  The Wikipedia article on "Tax Evasion in the United States" indicates that the approximate money 'lost' (and thereby gained by non-payers) is $305 billion in 2010.  If only 1/100 of a penny for each dollar thus saved was paid into
 a fund, that would be $30.5 million, which would be plenty to make sure that Federal tax evasion would be extremely difficult to prosecute.  As well as every other Federal crime.  Most accountants would see that as a good investment, and should advise their clients accordingly.

You are looking at this idea from the standpoint of a single defendant.  I am looking at this from the standpoint of the entire (U.S. federal) court system.  I am aware that most defendants will, in fact, be guilty of the crime charged.  Ordinarily, what happens is that the prosecution offers a plea deal that they consider realistic, and the defendant eventually agrees to some deal, with no trial involved.  That is why about 70,000 new defendants get convicted in the
 Federal system each year:   As I recall reading, about 3,500 demand, and receive, jury trials.  The remainder, 66,500, are convicted through plea deals.  Currently, many and in fact most of these defendants consider themselves fated to be convicted, and they see no 'upside' to pleading not-guilty and receiving a trial.  But I propose that an amount, for purposes of argument $5,000, be offered.  It will be paid after the defendant enters a not-guilty plea to a Federal felony,  and is sentenced (if he is convicted) or after he is acquitted.  Further, the defendant may direct that the money be paid to a third party, but NOT any government agency, court, or otherwise.
    Many defendants who are already resigned to being convicted may have little or no money:  To them, an offer of $5,000 is an amazing windfall.  A person who is facing a (current average) sentence of 3 years (36 months) would get $5000/36 months, or $139 dollars per month, which buys a substantial amount of commissary.  (In prison, they have a store called a 'commissary', where they sell food, clothing, shoes, electronics, OTC medicine, etc.  Prisoners who have this much money live much happier lives in prison, compared to those who don't.)  He has a powerful motivation to accept the money.  Moreover, he knows that every other defendant is being offered the same deal.  He knows that if he pleads not guilty and demands and receives a jury trial, which is his right, he will receive the money.    He will get the money...AFTER he receives the trial.   He will, if necessary, be defended by a 'Federal Public Defender', who is paid by the
 government.   tax-deductible.
Well, that's the general idea.  But most of the work will be done by mail:  New cases can be discovered using a system called PACER  ( which allows anyone to identify new criminal (or civil, which is irrelevant here) cases.  Form-letters can be sent to defendants, and their attorneys.      Cost-per-case won't be especially relevant.  While the number of physical courtrooms is one limitation, more important is the fact that it is very hard to put on a jury trial.  There is a lot of paperwork, witnesses must be corralled, jurors must be selected.  It ties up a lot of people for days.  Further, the Federal courts are already clogged with civil cases:  There simply is not a lot of 'give' in the current Federal Court system to add a flood of new cases.  Even if, hypothetically, the number of trials could be doubled, from 3,500 to 7,000, that would still be a reduction of a factor of 10 from today's 70,000 defendants.   While it is still conceivable that some defendants will take deals anyway, those deals will probably have to be much better than would have previously been given.     There is also an addition 'attack' that can be added, if it turns out to be desirable.  Regrettably, there are many homeless people who, for one reason or another, would actually be better off if they got sentenced to a few months or years in prison.  "Three hots and a cot", so the saying goes.  Doubtless some substantial proportion of prisoners are exactly such people.  But what if it were publicized that a person could do a 'note-robbery' of a bank, collect the money, and either flee or stay right there, in the bank.  They will get $5,000 after a Federal felony trial.  For some of these people (tens of thousands?) this would amount to a very attractive offer.  It would even more thoroughly flood the Federal 'justice' system.
 after their
    If you had made this claim 8 months ago, you would have been widely seen as having a valid point.  The problem is, a lot has happened since then, primarily flowing from Snowden's leaks.  Storage of most/all emails, backdoors in encryption systems, cell-phone metadata collection and (possibly) cell-site location monitoring, as well.  Ultimately, most of the stories contain a 'then X was served with a subpoena', or 'somebody was leaned on by the Feds', or 'the ISP was convinced to turn over secret information'.   These events had their negative consequences because some government had the power to extort cooperation.   Even if the public doesn't hear about these details, they exist.  The power of government is the ability to threaten people or companies with compliance, sometimes (but not always) because they did something illegal, even if they did nothing wrong.  See, for example, Joseph Nacchio, Quest CEO who was victimized apparently for
 refusal to turn over phone data.      We don't advocate encryption simply because it's fun:  We advocate encryption because it has a tendency to either defeat, or make it harder for, the enemy.  And 'the enemy', more times than not, is a government.  And if that 'enemy' has the ability to threaten, to strongarm, to 'rubber-hose' either our allies or the people we turn to for services, our positions are vastly more tenuous.  There is no doubt that ultimately, there WILL be some prosecutions, some of which are high-level prosecutions.  Keep in mind that as a libertarian, I would be ecstatic if the Federal government totally lost the ability to enforce anti-drug laws.  But I think that it would be possible to do more than that:  To disable governments' ability to act in any and all ways that violate libertarian principle.  And,  I would rather take my chances if 93% of the prosecutions are disabled, than if 0% are disabled.  I think you need to consider this matter quantitatively, not merely qualitatively.

    You asked, "is it legal?".  Well, I (happily) no longer have access to the Lexis Law Library computers in prison, so I can't easily look up legal precedent.  However, I don't think that much precedent will exist on this issue:  It is 'cutting edge' law.  Chances are good that it isn't legal, in the sense that it hasn't been declared legal.  From what I read on recent CP messages, it sounds like the Feds are engaging in what would be, if done by non-government types, illegal 'cracking'.  Flooding a server in a denial of service attack is presumably illegal today, if done in America, and also if done in America directed against foreign hardware/software.  Placing malware is probably also illegal in such situations.  And since one of the servers in question is in France, French law would presumably apply as well.  (It is possible those government-types who engaged in these actions are now criminals, from the standpoint of French law, or even
 American law, although perhaps nothing will be done about that.)
   The next question is, "Can the fruits of these activities be used in court against [fill in the blanks]?".  There is a doctrine in American law called "Fruit of the poisonous tree" see     , which generally prohibits the use of evidence obtained by the commission of a crime.  But since this doctrine was initiated many decades ago, long before the Internet era, it cannot be certain  how this principle will be applied to computer communications.       Actually, I was on numerous occasions the victim precisely this kind of activity:  The car I drove (in June 1998 and April 2000-October 2000) had a GPS tracking transmitter placed on it, without a warrant.  (the then-current legal thinking was that no such warrant was required; in 1999 there was a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case, US v. McIver, that upheld this idea, although that case was quite distinguishable from mine because in the McIver case, there was 1.  A real crime.   2.  That the vehicle and the defendant were connected to.  (Neither of which existed in my case June 1998 or April 2000-October 2000.)  Curiously, despite the presence of the tracking device probably as early as April 2000, the Feds went through the motions of getting a (secret, of course) warrant for a DIFFERENT tracking device in late October, 2000, omitting any mention of the fact that they had such a tracker already placed for many months.  A lawyer would
 use this as evidence of deception by the Feds, and of admission that they knew that the previously-placed tracker was illegal:  Otherwise, why bother obtaining that October 2000 warrant, if they could have used the information from the previous device at any trial?    In January 2012, in a case U.S. v. Jones, the Supreme Court decided that placing such transmitters (even if the car in question is on publicly-accessible property) required a warrant:  In other words, to do so without a warrant is illegal and a violation of the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
     Don't think I was unaware of the (likely) placement of that 2000 tracking device.  I virtually assumed such a thing was there.  But, try as I might, I couldn't get my crooked, colluding attorney (Robert Leen, appointed about November 21, 2000) to demand the fruit of that previous (2000, and 1998) tracking devices for trial.  It isn't that the information thus collected was important in itself:  Rather, the mere fact that a tracking device was placed (without probable cause, or reasonable suspicion that any crime had been, was being, or would be committed, would have exposed a lot of the criminality committed by the Feds.  They would have had to answer the question, "Why did you place those tracking devices on Mr. Bell's car, if you had no reason to believe there was a legitimate law-enforcement reason to do so?".    I attempted to fire attorney Leen about December 8, 2000, when he refused to actually defend me by looking for and asking
 for such evidence.  (The evidence I already knew existed.)
    Curiously, Andy Greenberg (author of "This Machine Kills Secrets") falsely claimed in his book that I had fired every lawyer I was given.  The truth is more enlightening:  In fact, I didn't fire (or even attempt to fire) my first lawyer, Peter Avenia:  He resigned, against my opposition to that, in early-mid-1999.  Every subsequent lawyer I had I ATTEMPTED to fire, yet in each case I was unsuccessful at accomplishing that.  I attempted to fire them when I verified that they were intending to betray me; but I was in all cases entirely unsuccessful at firing them.  They were allowed to stay by the judge, purporting to 'represent' me for many months or even years, until they were successful at doing the damage to me that they intended to do.  At that point, and ONLY at that point, did they leave, usually by requesting the judge to allow them to resign.  So it is accurate to claim that I never 'fired' any lawyer:  I was never allowed to do so.
    Note:  Andy Greenberg could have avoided a great deal of error in his writing if he had merely sent to me a copy of what he intended to write, to give me the opportunity to correct it.  He didn't.

 <20131007094818.GA2671     I don't think I'm ignoring game-theory as much as you may think I am.  Obviously, people who are independently wealthy (and particularly if they have high incomes) are powerfully motivated to challenge any charges.  To them that $5,000 reward will have little effect at all.  The reason I think 'denial-of-disservice' will work is that a very large fraction of (current) Federal criminal defendants are not well financed, and in some cases many will view a few months (or years) in the pen as being tolerable.  There are probably 40,000 illegal-aliens, mostly drug smugglers.  A whole slew of bank-robbers.  A large fraction of the rest are there due to drug cases.  Only a very small proportion of those prisoners are the kind of wealthy, savvy people that you are describing.  Now, understand that one reason I believe what I do is because of a great deal of experience in observing the system first-hand, and it would take a long time to expose you
 to enough facts to demonstrate why I believe the things I do.  Your analysis is seemingly plausible if every defendant in question is independently rich, white-collar, and intelligent, but most prisoners don't have those advantages.      I understand why (in theory) plea-bargaining is done.  The problem, it's been horribly misused:  It was, no doubt, used in 1980 when there were about 20,000 Federal prisoners.  But rather than keeping the total prisoner population down and within reasonable limits, they decided to 'blow up the balloon' as far as they could, and thus the current figure is 220,000 prisoners.  'Plea bargaining' is precisely what made this abuse possible.   It WASN'T because people suddenly (or even gradually, over time) decided to commit 11 times as much crime as before!  This is a clue (!) that this increase in prisoner population isn't an unavoidable outcome, but in fact is entirely artificial and certainly avoidable endpoint.         I don't disagree with your idea of capping convictions (by law) at, say, 10,000 per year, at least as a concept: In fact, I can see that it would be a great step forward.  But the difficulty is, how can that be done?  Is it possible to force it on 'the system'?  And given America's corrupt/incompetent/malicious Congress, would they have a reason to vote in such a limitation?   They voted for the legislation that brought us to where we are now, and have tolerated it for 30+ years.   What I am proposing ought to work with that effect, even better, but without any need to convince these guys that it's a good outcome.   (Even better:  My idea amounts to a system to cap convictions at perhaps 5,000 per year, limited not by 'law' but instead to clog the system with its own detritus.)      Another solution I'd implement ("if I were King...") would be to prohibit sentencing convicted defendants at more than 10% greater than the time offered in the plea agreement (If the plea agreement offered 36 months, the ending sentence if convicted would be no greater than 39.6 months):  The current system only tries 5% of the defendants by jury; if sentences were limited to that 10% upgrade, far more defendants would demand a jury trial, and that would 'automatically' limit the number of defendants who could be convicted.  So, that would be a solution.  But getting Congress to approve such a change in law would be difficult or impossible.  (At least without AP-type convincing.)   I think America's Founding Fathers would have been astonished to learn that the jury system has been so obviously subverted as it is today.  But I am not in any way confident that such a solution could, in fact, be implemented, particularly against the will (and,
 thus, the influence) of the hundreds of thousands of people (cops, lawyers, judges, prison guards) who profit from the current system.
     Also, I should mention that there have been and are a lot of illegal (not legal) activities in regards to Federal criminal sentencing over the last 13 years.  In 2000 there was a case called 'Apprendi v. New Jersey', which started out on the right track but all Federal appeals courts rejected the application of its principle to Federal criminal cases.  Then there was Blakely v. Washington (2004) which further expanded the thrust of the principle.  Unfortunately, an evil bitch named Ginsburg screwed up things in a truly wacky Supreme Court case called U.S. v. Booker (2005)      , completely backsliding in this line of cases.  Probably none of you reading the CP list have any idea what an atrocious history these cases had, especially Booker, but they are in large part why I have absolutely no confidence at all that the Federal 'criminal justice' system has any hope of being repaired,
 except perhaps by AP or 'denial of disservice attack' methods.

I think maybe you are neglecting game theory for the accused, its hard to
incentivize people to act in their collective interests, when they are
thinking of their own future freedom and lost earning capacity.  I imagine
you even have researched the statistics for this, but to summarise the game
theory scenario: plea bargaining clearly results in less accurate justice
(more innocent people do jail time), but has the real-politic benefit of
reducing the cost of implementing justice.  The usual pattern (made up
average numbers) is accept the plea do a discounted (lower than sentencing
guideline) 3 years, reject the plea, the prosecution will make less
reasonable/inflated charges (higher than sentencing guidelines, based on
more tenuous/unlikey to be provable charges) threatening a scary 30 years,
which in reality will be moderated down by a judge if
 the accused has the
money for a decent lawyer to 5 years, if they lose, or 0 years if they win;
if they are relying on an overworked, less capable public defender because
they dont have the money to buy proper representation, their chances of
winning are lower, and if they lose their post-trial sentencing will be
higher at 10 years.
Now law is a remarkably imprecise subject, especially when muddied with some
not-so-scrupulous and politically motivated prosecutors, police entrapment,
police bias (push for conviction based on opinion/bias, but statements given
disproportionate weight by a system that believes it's officers over the
public).  (Prosecutors and police are politically motivated because their
career depends on conviction rates, headlines).  The
 system seems to largely
ignore or not give adequate weight to investigating significant
prosecutorial abuse or police bias.  Prosecutorial abuse has to be strongly
proven, and the perpetrators are career ambitiuous, and legally qualified so
know the grey areas they can exploit where the abuse will be unprovable even
when it is very rarely alleged, or actually prosecuted.  Like police they
have the benefit of the doubt, in a judicial system that favors its own
officers, and so they are defacto largely immune from sanction from even
significant systemic abuse, unless stupid enough to be caught red handed
with with a smoking gun.  Which is to say even if you have millions to your
name for the most capable legal defense, and completely innocent with
reasonable but not
 iron clad alibi, its still subject to a high degree of
randomness depending on political motivations surrounding.
So therefore people will not fully follow game theory of going for the
lowest expected sentencing.  Ie if p is probabity of winning, and the
numbers above: then its 3 vs expected (p*0+(1-p)*5) so even p=2.5 its 2.5
expected vs 3, so if that was an investment you'd say good lets do it.  But
if its choice between 3years and no more stress, vs legal defense cost and
years of stress followed by 5 years if you're unlucky.  The dillema still
holds if the odds p=0.75 and you have lots of money I suspect sadly that
thats about as high as p gets for many areas of law.  You also have to
factor in the loss of income (at the average income for prisoners) into
 the
equation, and a premium because people would sooner earn less and have their
You cant reform the system via kickstart fund and incentivize people to not
accept pleas, well not at $5k anyway, because they'd need compensation for
lost earnings and a huge loss of liberty premium if they lose, a stress
premium for going to trial, and expenses for high quality legal defense. Those figures may no longer make game theory economic sense for society,
though I do think the centuries old principle that its more important for
one innocent party to go free than 100 guilty to be imprisoned is not
properly incorporated into the current system as plea bargaining removes
most of that intended objective.
Even with best attempts at
 fairness and balance from police, prosecutor and
judge (and there are genuine public spirited ethical people in some of those
roles, who would ignore the perverse career motivations on principle, so it
probably happens some of the time), the outcome STILL has an unfair plea
imbalance and STILL high randomness.  Its an imperfect system even under the
most favorable conditions.
I think the solution is to politically vote to arbitrarily cap the
incarceration rate to 10,000/annum; the justice system is not allowed to go
over that limit by law.  They will then focus on cases where they think the
incarceration is of most value to society (eg of making the public safer by
taking a violent criminal off the streets).  Maybe the cap should be
adjusted based
 on false conviction rates, if the false conviction rate
increases, the cap decreases.  Independent review of potential prosecutor
abuses should be increased.  Also the system should be restructured to
remove the career/political motivation for prosecutors to achieve high
conviction rates.  Their conviction rate should include a heavy mallus for a
false conviction, so they strive to avoid convicting innocent people, and
the system should somehow be adjusted to be less adversarial and to remove
sentencing penalties for going to trial.  eg Maybe the trial sentencing
level and charges should be set by an independent neutral body, not the
prosecutor, with the objective of keeping the trial and plea sentencing the
same.  Maybe simpler bargaining should be made illegal.
Another specific problem in the US is its a one dollar one vote system, and
operating privatized prisons is a high profit business.  The prison
operators votes therefore likely outweigh the proportion of the public that
is aware of the system problems or care enough to vote about it.  I believe
other eg european justice systems are in fact less prone to these issues. So another solution is to vote with your feet.
Basically in such a system you want to avoid even interacting with the legal
system or justice system, period.  Even volutarily interacting as a random
by-stander is unfortunately likely to be net loss to your finances or even
freedoms.  Even to complain publicly about the defects of the system is
probably risky once you
 have interacted with them.  Which is ridiculous but
thats the reality.
And finally some of the laws on the books are ridiculous on their face in
the opinions of the accused's peers.  eg computer abuse act which sees Weev
in jail and such like stories, and the sentencing guidelines are also often
ridiculous and non-proportional eg the sentencing threats to Swartz for what
was probably not even a copyright crime (going on the theory from his
previous activism pattern that he was aiming to republish the subset of
articles that were public domain).  His trial sentencing threat was above a
1st degree homicide with iron clad evidence, something's got to be wrong
with that.  The sentencing board are failing in their task.  Something
should also
 be done to restrict scope for judicial vengence also - Swartz
made a mockery of a stupid law, with his previous popularly supported
activism stunt, and so prosecutors were out to get him.
Also legal systems generally seem to lag 50-200 years behind the opinions of
the public Some jurisdictions are better than others, but the system of case
law mixed with precedent creates a built in brake on legal theory evolution. Out of touch with reality and public opinion prosecutors, judges and
sentencing another issue.  Probably law should be restricted to 1MByte of
ascii text and any law not approved by 90% referendum (1 person one vote,
not 1 dollar one vote) struck off automatically every year.
This state of significantly imperfect, and hard to reform, high cost
 legal
system issue is why smart-contracts look so attractive.  Its not even
obvious how to improve the legal systems and they evolve slowly and resist
experimental change.  Mathematical aprior enforcement, deference to mutually
agreed competing impartial arbitrators for dispute.  Pseudonymous
smart-contracting parties FTW.  Of course it doesnt work for in-person
crimes, except in a "Snow Crash" sense (cometing legal systems/governments
in the same physical space) but a justice system that leant heavily on
smart-contracts and refused as a principle to revise contracts where both
parties received competent legal advice, nor overturn arbitrator decisions,
would be a step forward for society.

Sorry, but I can't agree with that last statement.  "Lawful government"?  Which government would be willing to admit that it isn't 'lawful'?  The only government I would consider 'lawful' is one which complies with libertarianism's 'Non initiation of force/fraud principle', but since I am aware of no such government, I cannot agree that this statement has any practical purpose.  And while I might wryly agree with it, it would only be on the condition that all employees and officeholders of real (non-compliant with NIOFFP) government surrender, resign, and return every penny of money paid their for their 'services', back to 'day 1' of their employment.  And, of course, compensating all victims of that government for their damages and suffering.  Indoctrinated with the idea that they had the right to do what they did, I doubt that any of them would comply.

 unguessable. The deterministic process going on on my LAN might be good enough. It might not. What matters is the work factor of guessing.
A few weeks ago I posted a cite which referred to a RNG.  (actually three cites; one of them was this).  One of them consisted of a number (I'd choose 4, arbitrarily) of 'ring oscillators' (an odd number of digital inverters connected in a loop; I'd choose 7, 11, 13, and 17 inverters, being primes and unlikely to synchronize) which were each tapped at some point, feeding 2-input XOR (exclusive-or) gates, and those XOR outputs themselves being XOR'd together.  The output would feed the D input of a D-flip-flop, and that would be clocked via a signal synchronized with the (external) CPU clock.  (A read signal, presumably).  It could be built in relatively old technology (250 nanometers) with inverter delays of about 20 picoseconds, so the frequencies seen in the oscillator taps would be
 about 4/2.5/2.1/1.6 gigahertz.  Such a device could probably be accessed (clocked by the D-flip-flop) at 100 MHz, which is a far greater rate (100 megabits/second of random bits) than most systems would need.      Such a system might have a  little bias, perhaps leading to there only being 0.9 bits of entropy in each bit, but as a source of entropy that would be okay.  A somewhat more complex chip could store thousands of bits, perhaps with a microprocessor to monitor randomness and/or produce a truly random output.
      A logical company to build such a thing would be Texas Instruments, which was big on TTL (SSI, MSI, LSI, VLSI) even in the early 1970s, or any one of a few dozen other glue-logic manufacturers.   Target price:  50 cents in 1000's.

See   
"Sunday's New York Post page one headline about JPMorgan's fine screamed "Uncle Scam" with the sub headline "U.S. Robs Bank of $13B."
Wall Street went into a tizzy this weekend with the news that one of the
 nation's biggest banks agreed to fork over to the federal government $13 billion in fines related to its mortgage securities business.
The Post quoted bank analyst Dick Bove of Rafferty Capital as saying the deal "is a basic and fundamental attack on capitalism."
"It is possible that the government is taking away the property of the JPMorgan shareholders without the shareholders having committed any crime or having any say in the expropriation of these funds," Bove told the New York Post.
The deal, announced Saturday, settles civil penalties with the U.S. Justice Department, but doesn't stop any potential criminal prosecution. The Federal Housing Finance Agency sued JPMorgan and 17 other banks for faulty mortgage bonds two years ago.
Wall Street insiders were furious about the deal, noting that 80 percent
 of the mortgages being probed were actually acquired from the failing banks Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns. JPMorgan reportedly took over the risky portfolio at the request of the U.S. government in the wake of
 the 2008-09 financial meltdown.
============ end of quote from article =================
    If such a bank is willing to part with $13 billion to avoid (even more?) civil liability, wouldn't they be willing to pay $20 million or so to clog up the federal courts with criminal prosecutions and thus reduce those courts' ability to engage in civil actions as well?  (See my "Denial of Disservice Attack")

After I had posted my idea, I realized that there would be a possibility of ring-oscillator/ring-oscillator interactions if the delays of the individual inverters were of identical technology.  (invertor delay).  I thought of an idea to vary the size of the transistors (and/or capacitive loading) in the invertors such that the shortest-loop oscillator inverters were smaller, having perhaps 1-2% less delay, while the longest-loop oscillator inverters had a 4-5% greater delay, and the two intermediate-loop oscillators had 0-1% greater and 2-3% greater delays.  I think this would tend to prevent inadvertent synchronization between these four ring-oscillators.  Naturally, this would have to be tested, or at least characterized by the manufacturer.
Another, belt-and-suspenders, approach would be to add a long-period LFSR to the above circuitry (48-64 bits, say) and XOR the ring-oscillator outputs with themselves, as well as with that LFSR.  If the resulting signal had some sort of pattern, it would be of extraordinarily-long pattern.

2013/10/18 James A. Donald You can, however, be sure a microphone input is a reliable source of entropy, since fake entropy would interfere with its microphone function.
This is a syntatic non sequitur. Why would fake entropy interfere with a microphone's function? How is the microphone guaranteed to have "its microphone function"? Is a microphone input just the microphone's jack or an actual soundwave-modulated-magnetic-power-factor?
In either case it's also a semantic non sequitor. If someone plays a darn loud sine wave in the serverroom you can be sure the microphone will replicate it. It'd be doable to make any microphone always output it's maximum value, through a plenty of means. The sad thing is that it's sound, so it might even be doable at distance!
(scenario: people breaking into a running-but-physically-controlled server through manipulation of it's random numbers)
I think an internal radioactive source such as a smoke alarm makes great sense. Be wary to isolate it very well to prevent outside interference. If it just goes to MAXINT if someone holds his cube of madam curie next to the server's case it'd be a shame.
 Bell: wouldn't such a ring oscillator aggregate be subject to patterns? If you have something that can create more out of fewer pieces of randomness, isn't there plenty bad-randomness-sources to go on?

References:     The practice of shutting down a service in anticipation of the government showing up and issuing a warrant (whether search- or pen-register, or whatever) shows not merely a lack of guts, but also an incredible lack of imagination.  For example, I previously pointed out that there is no longer any real basis for keeping records on the metadata involved in in setting up a telephone call:  In 1979, when that Supreme Court case on pen registers was issued,      , telephone companies 'had to' keep metadata records in order to bill phone calls, including the number called and the time of the call.  Today, with 'unlimited' phone service (at least within the US; in some cases around the world) there is no reason that a phone company 'has to' keep those records, and certainly not all of them.      Why not x-out the last 3-4-7 digits of the 'called number', since it is not necessary to keep it in order to bill the customer??  (When was the last time most of us received a telephone bill listing the calls we made?  If we need to know what number(s) we called, they do not need to include all 3+7 numbers, do they?)   Why not omit the duration of the phone call?  The justification for these meta-data warrants presumes that the government is subpoenaeing 'business records':  So, no longer keep those 'business records'!  If the government claims these companies 'must' keep these records, then they are no longer 'business records' within the meaning of Smith v. Maryland:  They are purely 'government-compliance records'.  Or, encrypt them and only give the decrypt key to the customer, ONCE:  In the very unlikely chance that the phone co needs the records (which will never happen, of course), depend on the customer to regurgitate those
 keys:  They will likely have 'lost'/shredded/burned/pulped those keys, right?      Jim Bell
Syllabus from Smith v. Maryland:
"(b) Petitioner in all probability entertained no actual expectation of privacy in the phone numbers he dialed, and even if he did, his expectation was not "legitimate." First, it is doubtful that telephone users in general have any expectation of privacy regarding the numbers they dial, since they typically know that they must convey phone numbers to the telephone company and that the company has facilities for recording this information and does in fact record it for various legitimate business purposes. And petitioner did not demonstrate an expectation of privacy merely by using his home phone rather than some other phone, since his conduct, although perhaps calculated to keep the contents of his conversation private, was not calculated to preserve the privacy of the number he dialed. Second, even if petitioner did harbor some subjective expectation of privacy, this expectation was not one that society is prepared to recognize as "reasonable." When petitioner voluntarily conveyed numerical information to the phone company and "exposed" that information to its equipment in the normal course of business, he assumed the risk that the company would reveal the information [442 U.S. 735, 736]    to the police, cf. United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435 . Pp. 741-746" My (Bell's) comments follow:
   A phone company which announces that it WILL NOT record phone metadata gets around this decision, by allowing in its customers the 'reasonable expection of privacy' in their as-dialed phone numbers;  or at least it allows the customer to argue that unlike in Smith v. Maryland, he did indeed have an 'actual expectation of privacy' unlike in 1979.  Today's customer knows, contrary to any customer in 1979, that his phone company no longer has any 'legitimate business purposes' in keeping phone metadata recorded.  Further, 'society' is prepared to to recognize as 'reasonable' any business practice that a phone company may conceivably announce that it will follow, even if it thwarts the desires of government.  Unlike in 1979, when there was only one 'phone company' (in a given geographic area), and that phone company was beholden to the government rather than any individual customer, now phone companies have a legitimate motivation to compete on the
 issue of metadata privacy.

They should respond by saying, "You, Federal Judge, do not have the legal authority to order me/the company to ASSIST in the task, at most you can require me to ALLOW it; Further, you do not have the authority to order me/the company to not speak of the existence of the warrant:  See the First Amendment to the US Constitution".  Traditionally, there were two kinds of warrants:  'Search' (allow authorities to perform a search) and 'arrest' (find a person and stop him and take him into custody).  No secrecy was necessary with either 'search' nor 'arrest warrants'.   'Wiretap' and 'pen-register' warrants came into being when phone companies were closely regulated by the government, and they didn't have a sufficient motivation to defend the rights of their company and/or customers. They also did not have the motivation to challenge any order of secrecy they would have been under:  The government has an enormous burden to try to justify any violation of a person's/company's First Amendment right.  The mere fact that it would be very useful to keep the victim of a warrant unaware of a wiretap/pen-register warrant doesn't rise to the level of justification to violate the freedom of speech of the person or company on which the warrant is served.  The only reason we don't automatically assume that such rights do not exist in such cases is that for too long, phone companies were negligent in defending the rights of their customers.  This led courts to conclude that they had the power to require phone companies to
 keep silent:  The issue simply was never litigated.
  In both of these cases, the companies were not motivated to defend their rights to inform the victims of these warrants of the existence of that violation of their privacy.  I argue that now and in the future, all such companies should react as if they are in no way required to comply with any 'warrant' except that is specifically allowed in law. "Is there a law which requires a company to disclose a private SSL certification"?  No?!?  Then, "We challenge this with a lawsuit:  We have already served the intended victim of the warrant.  Here is the copy for the court".   They can initiate what's referred to as an 'interlocutory appeal', which would take weeks or months, and they can serve it on the victim of the warrant, making him part of the case and making the warrant rather useless.  In other words, if they wanted to fight it, they could do so quite easily.  Set it up so that a foreign lawyer, one outside the jurisdiction of the judge,
 informs the victim.  Play hardball, and moreover, make sure that the government knows you're going to play hardball,and that the information WILL get into the hands of the person to be tapped, in an unproveable fashion.  In court, force the government to argue that the victim of the warrant cannot be brought into the case as a necessary party.
The problem is that while they are aware of the costs to themselves, they arent' paying sufficient attention to the costs to the people to whom the warrant is directed.
Also, you didn't address my point about phone companies deliberately avoiding keeping phone metadata, to ensure that it cannot be subpoenaed.  It is that kind of 'imagination' that everybody needs to start using.

Germany Summons U.S. Ambassador Over Merkel Phone Tapping Claim Top News: German authorities summoned the U.S. ambassador Thursday to demand a full explanation for claims that the United States had tapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone, an allegation that has sparked deep outrage in Germany and revived uncomfortable memories of the extensive intelligence apparatus of East Germany. On Wednesday, Merkel called President Obama to air out her concerns about the allegations and received a promise that the United States is not monitoring her calls and will not do so in the future. That assurance, however, did not adress whether the United States had in fact monitored Merkel's calls in the past. Merkel's spokesman said the chancellor "views such practices... as completely unacceptable." "Among close friends and partners, as the Federal Republic of Germany   and the US have been for decades, there should be no such monitoring of   the communications of a head of government," Steffen Seibert, the spokesman, said in a statement. According to White House spokesman Jay Carney, the United States "is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of the chancellor." Wednesday's phone call was the second time in 48 hours that the president found himself on the phone with a European leader furious with America's intelligence agencies. Earlier in the week, Obama found himself on the phone with French President Francois Hollande after allegations surfaced that the National Security Agency had collected French phone calls on a massive scale.

My understanding is that many years ago, in the 1960's, many U.S. states passed laws prohibiting people from recording face-to-face conversations unless all parties were aware of the recording, and they consented to it.  Why was this?  I strongly suspect this:  It was in the 1960's the technical ability to do such recording easily developed, with compact equipment (radio transmitters or tape recorders), and the politicians realized that anybody they talked to (lobbyists and other legislators, as well as citizens) had a powerful motivation to record them.  Naturally, such recordings could surface at any time, with obvious embarrassing (and even incriminating) consequences.   Politicians' primary motivation was to protect themselves, NOT to protect ordinary citizens:  If such recordings were illegally done, it would tend to deter the making and/or release of them.  (Although today, with the Internet and Cryptome, and Wikileaks, it might not make
 any difference.)

To the list members of Cypherpunks:  I, Jim Bell (yes, THAT Jim Bell) have just (re-) subscribed to the Cypherpunks list.  (Pardon me if I don't immediately attempt to relate the numerous reason(s) for my unfortunate 15-year absence.)      Of some relevance to the list is the recent publication (by the US Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO) of my fiber-optic patent application.  See      .  No, the patent hasn't been granted yet.  A brief description of the invention follows:  A silica optical fiber in which the core and inner-cladding are made from silica in which the silicon-atom content is modified from the usual 92.23% (atom/atom) Si-28 content, 4.67% Si-29, and 3.2% Si-30.  A few of the possible advantage are, increase of the velocity-factor of the fiber to over 90% of 'c' (as opposed to the 68% of 'c' of existing fibers); a reduction in optical loss by a factor of 10-20 compared to existing fiber's 0.19 db/km; a factor of 10-20 reduction in 'optical dispersion' compared to existing fibers; an optical bandwidth increase to about 1000-1800 nanometers wavelength.
     There is actually the prospect of some crypto-relevance here.  There is the Bell's theorem (not me, but John Stewart Bell's) theorem to the EPR (Einstein Podolsky Rosen) paradox. See the Wikipedia article "Bell's Theorem.  This led to experimentation where a single 'entangled photon' was sent down two optical fibers in opposite directions.  Eventually (30 or so kilometers apart, I believe) these photons were detected.   See    .    My understanding is that the distance limitations of these experiments are determined primarily by the loss of the optical fiber.  If so, then a reduction by a factor of 10-20 in optical loss will result in an increase of a corresponding factor of 10-20 increase in the maximum practical distance of these kinds of quantum-entanglement experiments.  Presumably, this will lead eventually to the same degrees of increases in maximum
 distances over which quantum encryption could operate.

 >  NSA the calling records of every subscriber.
Armed with my nearly 12 years of daily visits to prison law libraries, I can report that this "Memorandum Opinion and Primary Order" contains many legal errors and false representations and assumptions, and indeed the facts have changed mightily since the issuance of the 1979 "Smith v. Maryland" Supreme Court decision that supported the use of 'pen registers', which provided (only) the phone number called by a given telephone line.  One is that in 1979, there was only one phone company, or at least one per geographic area, that fact having been changed by the 1983 breakup of the telephone monopoly by Judge Green.  The
 assumption can no longer be made that modern telephone companies WANT to share metadata with the government; prior to 1979 it would have been virtually assumed that they were willing to so share.  The Smith case, above, merely supported the practice of a phone company voluntarily giving information to the government, without the government obtaining a warrant:  It didn't require that these phone companies share that information without a warrant. Today, a company may simply be unwilling to share that data, or can be convinced to declare that unwillingness now (after the Snowden/NSA revelations) and the public can be expected to want its chosen phone companies to refuse.  Another difference (or reality) is that these warrants refer repeatedly to 'business records':  Ostensibly, because this metadata is a 'business record', somehow the phone co. can be expected to provide it.    While there may not have been any reason for
 phone companies to keep telephone calling records ('metadata') in 1979, there is certainly no need for such records today.  In 1979, long-distance telephone calls were billed by time, and by distance to the called party, and they generally kept the full phone number as part of the record..   Today, it is common to have unlimited LD contracts, which disregard the distance of the call or its duration, or both, at least within the US, making it entirely unnecessary for the phone company to keep records on calls. (Or, simply the duration of a phone call could be recorded, if the total time is billed.)   In principle, therefore, a phone company could announce that it was ceasing keeping such metadata, as a matter of business records.  Or, it could keep metadata, and X-out the last four digits of all called-telephone numbers, making those records virtually useless for any large-scale investigational use.  Yet another way for
 a phone co. to fight back would be to provide that metadata to the government, printed out on paper, in tiny "captcha"-type font, or perhaps in some kind of pseudo-randomized cursive font, so that it would be readable, yet it would also be virtually impossible for the government to return that information to an electronically-accessible font.  Sure, that tactic might result in yet another court-order, but that will amount to a further reason to challenge that court:  "The government is getting the information it requested, it may simply not be getting it in the form it wants."
Another attack is suggested by both the Smith case and this primary order url'ed above:  The assertion that there is no 'expectation of privacy' in phone numbers given by the user to the phone company(ies).  This could be challenged simply if the phone co's declared to its customers, "We will keep your telephone metadata secret except if given a warrant
 providing individualized suspicion against you:  A general warrant asking for all telephone metadata will not be honored and in fact will be publicized by means of leak or otherwise.  Further, we will no longer retain the last four digits of numbers you call, in your records, or the last four digits of your telephone number, in records of calls to you."  At that point, the 'expectation of privacy' declared non-existent by the 1979 Smith decision will return.

Yes, I understand that a dramatic reduction in loss could accomplish that.  But, as is obvious (particularly recently, with the Snowden revelations) we have far more important, yet basic, vulnerabilities to worry about just now, particularly since the major Internet and telecommunications companies are now known to have been betraying us by letting the NSA keep 'every' email, and telephone metadata, and adding crypto back-doors into net encryption software.
I propose that the public force such companies to sign what I'd call "Disloyalty oaths", promises to be disloyal to any and every government.  This would include a promise that if subjected to any sort of court order (even and especially those requiring that the company keep silent as to the existence of said order) that the order would be 'leaked' shortly, say less than a week, to an organization (Cryptome; Wikileaks) that would publicize it.  Primary methods as crude as leaving a few hundred copies of the order at the company water-cooler, or in the cafeteria, or by the copier, would probably induce volunteer leakers to mail copies to the leak-publication organizations.  Governments and courts have little reason to issue such orders if their existence will be leaked, particularly if they are going to be very quickly leaked.  Leaks, obviously, are very easy to do these days and the identity of the leaker would be very hard to know, and even harder
 to prove.  Chances are good that such court-orders simply will cease.

Consider:  Let's suppose there's a person in the Justice Department, I'll call him "Ed Justice" (in honor of Ed Snowden) with access to that order, who decides to leak a copy of the court order to Cryptome, Wikileaks, etc, a couple of days after it is served on the target media corporation.  (He may do so for reasons of malice, or perhaps benevolence:  He WANTS the order to leak, because he doesn't agree with the practice.)   The usual 9-by-12 brown envelope with no return address, only stamps, careful to avoid fingerprints, etc.  The leak-publisher(s) publishes the order.  How does the government prove that the lead was done by the target media corporation, and not by somebody else?  A criminal prosecution requires evidence, and none will exist.
In addition, there is an excellent argument that any order of secrecy is an obvious violation of the First Amendment to the US Constitution.  I don't recall reading any justification for such orders in any legal cases, but I think that this would be on flimsy legal ground.

I guess you did not get my point.  I'm not depending on, or even hoping,  that such a person as "Ed Justice" would exist.  (Although it would certainly be useful.)  Rather, I am observing that the government would not likely be able to prove that "Ed Justice" DOESN'T exist.  Any prosecution of somebody based on the charge that he leaked a court order would require that there be proof that the person charged leaked the document in question.  The defense would argue, 'The prosecution hasn't excluded the possibility that the actual leak was secretly accomplished by a government employee for his own reasons.  We can see that people like Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden do indeed exist.   How do we know that the document in question wasn't leaked by yet another person?"

Generally, I'm not worried that government might 'react' to such things.   Government generally 'reacts' slowly, poorly, inaccurately, and ineffectively. And, it generates enemies each time it acts.   Look how the US Govt reacted to PGP1:  Did they actually accomplish anything, other than pissing people off and giving useful publicity to Phil Zimmermann?  How many people have been prosecuted in the last 20 years for 'exporting encryption'?   How did the US Govt react to opposition to their Clipper-chip proposal?  How many Clipper chips are in your devices?  Zero.  No.  When the government seems to succeed, it is usually because it acted in secret, and thus avoided making enemies and stirring up the opposition.  So generally, I conclude that fighting against the government is well worth the battle, despite the fact that some of us occasionally get heavily stepped-on.    B^)       ("ouch!!!")

@_subject: Charge for Pen Register Service?  $600 per target per two months. 
The url      includes the claim, "Additionally, telephone companies typically charge an average of $600 per target to conduct pens [registers]."  (Didn't say for how long, but I suppose it's two months.)    And,    said, "For example, Cox Communications charges $2,500 for a pen register/trap-and-trace order for 60 days."       Imagine how expensive it would be if the NSA got a bill for $600 per two months to conduct a 'pen register' (metadata) on your, and the same charge covering everyone else's, phone.  I'd suggest to the phone co.  that they charge that $600 per two months, then take $200 of that and give me the whizziest, unlimited-service around the world, the bestest service that I could possibly want, and make a $400 profit to boot!   Myself, I'd be far more comfortable if my metadata was being sold to the NSA if my full cell-phone
 bill was paid-for by them! In fact, at those prices, I'd want a second phone, too!  (Does this make me a sell-out?!?)  Interesting guide to telecoms to comply with the law:  I wonder if anybody has implemented a 'metadata-killer':  An app, perhaps, for a smartphone which accesses a 'telephone remailer':  A (friendly) MITM (Man in the Middle) which can be called, and will automatically forward the call based on encrypted-number data, and maintain the connection to the target phone number.  It would make collection of metadata much more difficult.   Companies which do internet phone calls would be obvious candidates for that function.  (Skype, Ooma, etc.)

No, I'm sorry, I have no links with other MIT alums.
One big misunderstanding that would have been able to clear up with aaron swartz had I been aware of his situation, that I hope other readers will now learn, is the issue of how much time he (or other federal defendants) would have faced if convicted.  Federal criminal laws generally include with them a statement of the maximum punishment that can be applied:  They are generally even numbers, such as "5 years", "10 years", "15 years" or so.  However, such statements are basically archaic:  In 1987, the laws were changed (prisoners called it "new law") to calculate sentences based on the defendant's criminal history, the severity of the crime, and other facts.   See         The following sentencing table is part of that Wikipedia article.  I assume that Aaron Swartz would have had a "zero" "criminal history", in other words the Column labelled "I" (0 or 1) would have been used.  An offense level up to 8 would have specified a sentence between 0 and 6 months.   I would have to look up the specific charges to see what he faced, but I strongly doubt that he would have been sentenced to over 2 years, and probably under 1 year.         Jim Bell
================quote from Wikipedia begins================
Sentencing table
The sentencing table is an integral part of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.[24]
The Offense Level (1-43) forms the vertical axis of the Sentencing Table. The Criminal History Category (I-VI) forms the horizontal axis of the Table. The intersection of the Offense Level and Criminal History Category displays the Guideline Range in months of imprisonment. "Life" means life imprisonment. For example, the guideline range applicable to a defendant with an Offense Level of 15 and a Criminal History Category of III is 24–30 months of imprisonment.

On my Facebook page (which I rarely access; less than once every 2 weeks) I have zero friends, by my policy.  I first heard about 'friending' on FB nearly 10 years ago.  I felt then, and I continue to feel, that this is far too 'binary' for me:  If I started classifying people as 'friends', I'd have to decide where to draw the line.   And that, I didn't want to do.  Therefore, any requests to 'friend' me, I do not activate, and I explain to the people involved why I won't.  Everybody seems to understand, and I've been told many people have a similar opinion of that.

   I was subjected on a number of occasions to what should have been illegal GPS-tracker use.  This kind of tracker use was finally declared a "search" within the meaning of the 4th Amendment to the US Constitution in a January 2012 US Supreme Court case, US v. Jones.   The 9th Circuit Court case which the government would presumably try to use to justify that tracking was called U.S. v. McIver (9th Cir. 1999), where such a GPS tracking device was put on a vehicle seen at a location where a marijuana-grow was in operation.        (Note:  This reference to the McIver case was written in 2008, 4 years prior to US v. Jones.)     A Third Circuit case from 2013 that addresses this matter (and comes to the correct conclusion) is US v. Katzin (3rd Cir. 2013).            The use of the McIver case to justify the placement of the tracking device on my car(s) in 1998 and 2000 should not have worked, because unlike the McIver situation, I was actually not suspected of any crime, neither in 1998 nor 2000:  I was, in effect, being stalked by Federal agents who were engaging in criminal activity against me.  (Assault by Federal informant Ryan Thomas Lund, on November 25, 1997, and promulgation of a forged, fake, fraudulent "appeals" case 99-30210 from about June 20, 1999 through April 2000, and well beyond.)
    One quirk was my allegation (which due to corruption of the Tanner court as well as corrupt lawyer Robert Leen) that the Feds had actually placed a GPS tracking device on my car, shortly after my release on April 13, 2000.   Eventually, in late October, 2000, they petitioned a Federal court for a warrant to place a DIFFERENT GPS tracking device, WITHOUT alerting that court that the previous device was present.  This omission of that relevant information constituted fraud on that court, because the Feds presumably argued that they 'needed' the information to find out where I was going:  Since they already had one such device on my car, they obviously already knew what I was doing.      And, if they would have argued that placing such a device on my car was 'legal', then why would they have had to obtain a warrant in late October 2000?  Why not simply use the information they had obtained from April 2000-October 2000?   The answer, in hindsight, is simple:  The Feds had no justification at all to place a tracking device on my car during and after April 2000:  For them to use that information about October 2000, they would have had to explain why the tracking device had been placed as early as April 2000.  That they could not do, unless they admitted that they had no articulateable reason to track me during that time.       Note:  On about November 21, 2000 I told my (corrupt, appointed) lawyer Robert Leen about my suspicion that they had been tracking me from April-October 2000; I had a right to have all such information available to me at my "trial".  But, Leen wasn't really acting as my 'first line of defense':  Leen was acting as the GOVERNMENT'S 'first line of offense'.   Because Leen wouldn't act to obtain that (secret) trackig device information in 'discovery' (legal term of art, requiring government to turn over information before trial) I sent a letter about December 8, 2000 to Judge Tanner, telling him that I 'fired' Leen for his deliberate negligence.  Tanner did not allow me to fire Leen, and I was denied the ability to present this (and essentially any other) evidence at the "trial".   While you may have heard snippets about how my trial was 'fixed', the reality was far worse than that.
       Any questions?

 Feds Consider Vehicle Location Tracking in New Cars Proposal may lead to more accidents, mileage taxes and tickets for “recorded traffic violations”
Kit Daniels
January 1, 2014
In a few weeks, federal officials may require new vehicles to have trackable GPS “safety” devices which could be hacked to cause automobile accidents and may even usher in mileage taxes.
With the V2V device, the GPS location for all new cars could be recorded. Credit: Minesweeper via Wiki
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is spending the next couple of weeks mulling over its decision to install vehicle-to-vehicle communications – known as V2V for short – into new vehicles which would allow them to “talk” to each other through GPS data under the guise of “accident prevention,” according to ABC News.
However, one official involved with the government study of the devices admitted that hackers could abuse the system to create mass havoc on the road.
“Who has access and how do you secure the data?” David Wise of the Government Accountability Office asked.
He even said that the V2V would rely on GPS data that can be used to easily track a vehicle – and thus the occupants inside.
“Privacy is a real challenge,” Wise said.
This is refreshing honesty from a government official.
The fact that the V2V system could be hacked to cause high-speed pile-ups exposes the political lie that these devices were designed to prevent accidents. In fact, bureaucrats want the V2V installed in vehicles in order to track Americans like animals in another sick extension of the domestic spy grid pioneered by the NSA.
With vehicle tracking, big government politicians could also accomplish their goal of taxing drivers by every mile driven.
Lawmakers could even use this sort of technology to pass laws that allow local governments to mail drivers tickets for “recorded traffic violations” as they already do with red light cameras.
And to really stick it into drivers even further, the costs for the GPS technology will be tacked onto the price of new cars – forcing Americans to pay for their own enslavement.
Take a look at the following articles to see for yourself the hidden agenda behind the V2V technology:=======================end of quote============================

    One clue would come from my suspicion that agents of the Federal government, in March 1995, lured away the former resident of 7302 Corregidor (see    ), the house immediately to the east of mine, and bought that house.  (In the picture provided, my house at 7214 Corregidor is just to the left of the house shown.)   The prior resident was a local school (high school?) science teacher, and he was hired at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratories in Richland Washington, a Federal government laboratory akin to Oak Ridge, Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, etc.         The purpose of this was to be able to acquire that house, and use it as a spying location against me. (The names ostensibly buying the house were Daniel J. and Dori J. Sabin, and they ran a remodeling operation named "Sundown Development Construction Corporation".     )   Note that the date the house was sold is shown as March 10, 1995.  (This is odd, because school teachers' lives are oriented around the 'school year', which in most locations in America go from about September 1 to about June 1.  They sign contracts with the school to work for that year, and are bound to do so.   While I don't recall when the prior, lured occupant left, based on the sale date it appears that he sold that house months before the end of his school year.  For a school teacher, this would have been highly unusual.)       The sale price is shown as $180,000, which I think was rather high for that time. (But not unexpected if the government wanted to lure him away quickly.  Presumably he got a large raise, as well.)  They immediately began an extensive remodeling and enlargement operation on that house, including adding a second floor.  As I recall, this remodel took nearly a year; seemingly the house was unoccupied during that time.  Further, during a long period very little work was actually being done, as I recall.  (This remodeling would have dramatically increased the value of that house; the sale price in 1995 of $180,000 cannot be directly compared with the current value of the much-larger and more-up-to-date house as it exists today.)
    While I don't remember precisely the date I published the first part of my AP essay, I believe that it was no more than a few weeks prior to March 10, 1995, on the 'Digitaliberty' discussion area.       (Hence my reference to Digitaliberty in the essay; it wasn't until many weeks later that I'd heard of the 'Cypherpunks' list.)  My recollection that the person who initiated 'Digitaliberty', Bill Frezza, was interested in the use of technology for the development of 'liberty', although the first part of my AP essay apparently exceeded his tolerance for radicalism.  At some point somebody transported Part 1 of the AP essay to Cypherpunks, and informed me of the existence of CP; I acquired Internet access and joined the Cypherpunks list.
    The acquisition and operation of nearby government spy locations was/is certainly not new.  Consider the case of Robert Hanssen,         While this Wikipedia article does not mention it, I read contemporaneously various news reports (2001) that said the government set up a spy location near Hanssen's house.  How far away that location was, those reports did not say.   Presumably, this was a standard tactic, and non-controversial. (At least in the case of actual criminality being suspected and investigated.)  The difference, in my case, was that not only did they not suspect me of any crime, they knew that I was innocent of any crime.  It is obvious, therefore, that they engaged in this activity not because of any crime (which, had it existed, would have made me a 'criminal') but because of my writing and publication of Part 1 of my Assassination Politics essay.  (Which made me 'an enemy', 'a
 dissident', an opponent of not merely the Federal government, but all governments everywhere.)  In other words, the government engaged in activities more appropriate for the former Soviet Union, and seemingly not for America.      One question that should be asked, is:  "What what the government did, acquiring that house at surveilling me from it, legal?"   They would presumably say, "yes".  But why wasn't that "stalking", within the meaning of the criminal statute?  After all, in November 21, 2000 I was accused of "Interstate Stalking", simply for going around, looking at various locations, not confronting (nor even seeing) anyone.  I was investigating things, because I knew that something was (and had been) happening.  Was I less entitled to do what I did, than what the government was to do what it did?  An inmate/informant named Ryan Thomas Lund (his recent activity:    )  was instructed to attack me, which he did on November 25, 1997, because I was beginning to resist the plea agreement that I had been offered, and initially accepted.
    Don't think that I didn't already suspect the house at 7302 Corregidor during that time.  In fact, I informed my (corrupt) attorney Peter Avenia    of some of my suspicions.  (But, of course, I didn't know at that time Avenia was corrupt.)  Sometime about December 1, 1997, Avenia visited me at FDC Seatac jail and I told him of Lund's attack.  His answer?  "I don't know anything about.....that")  (Avenia was also Lund's attorney.)   And in about July 1998, after I was re-arrested, ostensibly for a 'supervised release violation', the prosecutor Robb London (who is currently the direction of communication at Harvard Law School    ) claimed that I 'said that the government was spying on him' [Jim Bell].   Which, of course, was true:  I DID suspect, and say, that the government was spying
 on me!   Problem is, London was using this bare assertion to justify me being sent to the Federal Medical Center at Springfield, Missouri, for a mental evaluation (!).  Another problem was, London didn't say I was _wrong_ when I said (or suspected) that.  (Without at least an allegation that I was wrong, what justification is it to claim that I asserted that the government was spying on me?!?  Is merely saying that I believed the government was spying on me enough to justify sending me to a mental evaluation?  Would an American's "suspecting" that all his telephone metadata and email was being copied by the NSA, prior to Snowden's allegations, constitute a justification to send that 'comrade' for a mental evaluation in Siberia...er...Springfield?)    And worse, I was not allowed to challenge the (implicit) allegation of falsity in my assertion that the government had been spying on me.  However, I used the situation (a hearing) to extract a
 promise (only partly kept) from Avenia that he would investigate my allegations.  Many months later, perhaps in February 1999, Avenia send investigator Sharon Callas to Vancouver.  Mysteriously, Callas was said to have 'disappeared' (or perhaps 'resigned') later.  I never saw the results of her investigation.  Later, in about April 1999, attorney Avenia resigned, but NOT at my request.  I suspected then, and still suspect today, that his resignation was triggered by something that Sharon Callas discovered during that investigation:  Perhaps she confirmed enough of my allegations that Avenia knew that I was correct.        
     So, what had been going on?  Presumably, the interest in me (including local spying) was NOT based on allegations of crime, or even suspected future crime, in March 1995.  In other words, no government law enforcement agency would have been legally entitled to spy on me.  Presumably, the spying that did occur was, itself, illegal:  And, had it become exposed (which it should have been if I had not been assaulted by Ryan Thomas Lund on November 25, 1997), the Federal government would have suffered an enormous hit of bad publicity.  This corruption must have been at an extremely high level:  The forgery of fake appeal case 99-30210, initiated secretly and kept from me for 10 months, with numerous forged documents filed (at least two ostensibly being from me, but they were also forged:  You can see them on PACER:       9th circuit court.  One was docketed about November 10, 1999 and the other was docketed about March 4,
 2000:   Both dates by my recollection).   That would have taken the cooperation of some very powerful people in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, possibly including a few judges.   Further, every document filed in that case, from June 1999 through April 2000, was (illegally) not delivered to me when I was at FDC Seatac (until September 3, 1999) and when I was at FCI Phoenix from September 10, 1999 to my release on April 13, 2000.  Indeed, there were at least two pieces of certified mail described in the docket for case 99-30210 that were mailed to my then-correct address at FCI Phoenix, which didn't get to me, presumably they were stolen by BOP staff at FCI Phoenix.   (Not to mention my allegation that this entire docket was RE-forged once they learned that I had requested an appeal that I hadn't known was already in progress.)
     Doesn't this begin to sound like the classic "government conspiracy" that people who don't like to talk about "government conspiracies" argue don't happen.  (Except rarely, say the Watergate incident in 1972).  One of the reasons that I look (way) down on a few of the doofuses around here (CP list) who don't seem to 'like' me is that they apparently take that position without taking the trouble to read my 2003 lawsuit (02-1052; Portland Federal Court) and learning what I allege the government and its minions did.  It will be interesting to see if any of them step up, apologize, and say, "Sorry, Mr. Bell, we didn't know..."

observation:  with regard to illegal and fraudulent tactics used in
your prosecution, court case, appeal, etc. it is wondered if the
corrupt actions of individuals may go beyond a severawl government
employees acting this way in isolation, and instead involve a hidden
or structural approach, such as a domestic FISA-like program, where
their actions are protected and so they are not concerned with issues
of their own wrong doing because they are acting as part of a larger
organized, coordinated effort. perhaps beyond normal processes though
still 'legal' due to secret laws or secret hearings or decisions
allowing this activity to occur. it seems more likely that activity
like this is signed-off-on by someone with authority than not, unless
there is total lawlessness within government and bureaucracy. i do not
know enough to know though tend to believe the fraudulent activities
must be structural not anomalous, given their coordination and purpose
to convict and create endless problems with the bureaucracy.
about the V2V cars- what is the likelihood that automobiles are _not
tagged in some way, just like computers, given that location or other
data is critically important and perhaps more easily accessible or
tracked outside of a particular environment, say run-ups to meetings
or whatever, the timeliness of data as it approaches a meeting point,
thus ramps up in criticality, say if a cellphone conversation decides
actions minutes before an encounter. or, to scan a city for someone
via satellites, pinging the missing submarine from satellite. given
highest priority to own every computer, how likely is it that vehicles
are not already being tracked, regardless of 'known technology' that
then brings this tracking into the open. even if via passive means,
giant RFID in the sky/net, say serial  that reflect back with
vehicle title databases, mapping geographies this way, 100,000
vehicles return signals, as if looking at asphalt and concrete heavens
using astronomy software to parse star/car-names. either installed in
new vehicles by default, or when serviced if a focused customer.
perhaps not advanced beyond passive ping, though are vehicles really
driving around autonomously besides redlight cameras and speed traps?
doubt it.

About 17 years ago I first learned about "3M louvered film"   , an extruded sheet product with tiny "louvers" of black plastic, separating clear plastic blocks.  The purpose of this product was to block light passing through at a greater-than-desired angle. (the limiting angle can be varied by buying different models of material.)  If a sheet was placed over a license plate, with the 'louvers' horizontal, the plate cannot be read if the camera is viewing the scene at a too-high elevation.  (alternatively, or in addition, a second sheet of vertical louvers can be placed in front or back of the horizontal louvers, which would prevent the plate from being read from a camera at a too-high azimuth:   the an angle, on the horizontal plane, from the side of the road).           Jim Bell

    My father, Samuel Warren Bell Jr.,  worked for Ford between 1965-67.  One day, my mother took me and my sister on a tour of Ford's enormous River Rouge    plant, which was an example of those 'all in one' plants, assembling not only the cars but building the components.  At one point, the tour group came to a catwalk spanning a railroad track inside a huge building.  I, running ahead, climbed the catwalk and walked to the middle of the span, the tour following behind.  But just as I got to the middle of the catwalk, a huge metal door opened up, and a railroad flatcar came out, carrying a huge (40 feet by 8 feet by 2 feet, I'd estimate today) orange-hot ingot of steel, rolling on the railroad track.  It went directly under the middle of the catwalk, precisely below I was at the time.  Didn't Richard Pryor say, "Fire is inspirational!"  Well, it was for me! I didn't expect the updraft.
      I guess I am walking in the steps of the same 'loyalty' shown by my father:  He once said that he was the only Ford employee to drive to work...in a Volkwagen car.  (not very politic in the mid-late 60's).
    Incidentally, my father invented the "Dual Clutch Transmission".   Wikipedia     tells you that a Frenchman named Adolphe Kegresse invented it just before WWII, but says that he didn't make a working copy.  Neither did my father (who was unaware of Kegresse's invention), but he (as he was obligated to do) presented the design to Ford management about 1966.  Perhaps not surprisingly, in hindsight, Ford didn't want it.  (That was the era of $0.20/gallon gas, and virtually every automatic transmission had 3 forward gears.).  It wouldn't have done any good for him to patent it himself:  Had he obtained a patent in, say, 1968, that patent would have run out  17 years later, in 1985.  As stated in the Wikipedia article, "The first series production road car to be fitted with a DCT was the 2003 Volkswagen Golf Mk4 R32."           Jim Bell

    I agree with your assessment.  But, of the many mistakes they made, the big one is that they underestimated my ability to observe and deduce what was going on at the time.  Shortly after the time I was first arrested in mid-April 1997, I concluded that they must have been spying on me from 7302 Corregidor.  I had a right to have any such evidence admitted in court, and they couldn't allow that to happen.  They had to exercise the collusion of corrupt lawyer Avenia to see that stopped.  Then, when I continued to demand evidence in July 1998, they had to further use the next corrupt lawyer, Judith Mandel, to ensure that I could not have evidence entered into the record.  Then, when I demanded the appeal that I didn't know I already had (99-30210) they had to employ yet another corrupt lawyer, Jonathan Solovy, to continue to conceal facts from me.  Etc.  It was an ongoing battle that still isn't over, and won't be over until I have completely
 won.        A major place in the "Hall of Shame" must go to Declan McCullagh, who failed and refused to work with me to expose this material in 2001 and 2002.  Indeed, I sent a "visitor's form" to him about March 2002, as he said he was visiting San Francisco for some event, and he said that he would visit me at Atwater California.  (USP Atwater).  In fact, he lied to me:  Weeks later, when he  hadn't shown up, I called him and he said he couldn't find the time to visit.  But I pointed out that in order for him to visit me, he would have had to fill out and mail in the visitor's form at least two weeks prior to the visit.  In other words, by failing to fill out the form, that proved that he didn't intend to visit me at all:  Therefore, his claim that he "couldn't find the time to visit" wasn't really true.  At THAT point, he got really upset!  He didn't respond to any of my letters after that.
      Another place in the "Hall of Shame" should go to a "60 Minutes" producer named Adam Ciralsky.  (He was ex-CIA in 1999, and in fact had a lawsuit against the CIA for religious discrimination      ).  Ciralsky sent me an Express Mail letter in December 2000, claiming to want to interview me on video.  I smelled a rat, and it turned out I was right.  He tried to lure me by saying that Mike Wallace wanted to talk to me.  Ciralsky's downfall was the fact that I had been watching "60 Minutes", on and off, since its beginning in 1970.  I knew, from his failure to ask questions, that his only interest in getting video was to do a sabotage piece on me.  I took advantage of the fact that Seatac FDC had a policy apparently denying video media visits, and basically told Ciralsky, "Put as many questions as you'd like on paper; I will answer all of them".   That would appear to be a very friendly
 position on my part, right?  Not the typical hard-to-interview behavior usually displayed by the 'bad guys' when '60 Minutes' cameramen drop by.    But, think about it:  If they had put such questions on paper, that would have been analogous to giving them a 'Rorshach test':  That would have exposed the position from which they were coming.  I wanted to take advantage of this written communication to, in effect, force them to actually investigate the story, rather than put on a hit-piece.  Turns out that I never got as many as a single question from Ciralsky!

Jim, correct me if i am wrong, what happened sounds like
a criminal or conspiratorial prosecution occurring outside or

@_subject: NSA and quantum computers 
Washington (AFP) - The US National Security Agency is making strides toward building a "quantum computer" that could break nearly any kind of encryption, The Washington Post reported Thursday.
Related Stories
The Post said leaked documents from fugitive ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden indicate the computer would allow the secret intelligence agency to break encryption used to protect banking, medical, business and government records around the world.
Quantum computing has been a goal among commercial firms such as IBM because it could harness the power of atoms and molecules, vastly increasing speed and security of computers and other devices.
But experts cited by the newspaper said it was unlikely that the NSA would be close to creating such a machine without the scientific community being aware of it.
"It seems improbable that the NSA could be that far ahead of the open world without anybody knowing it," Scott Aaronson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told the daily.
The NSA declined to comment on the report.
The Post said the leaked documents indicate that the agency carries out research in large, shielded rooms known as Faraday cages designed to prevent electromagnetic energy from entering or exiting.
Because of its vast computing power, a working quantum computer would break the strongest encryption tools in use today for online activities, including banking and emails.
Some technology firms such as Google and Yahoo have said in recent weeks that they were stepping up efforts to encrypt their communications following reports that the NSA had been able to break or circumvent many of the current encryption standards.
A September report by The New York Times, ProPublica and The Guardian, also based on leaked documents, said US and British spy agencies are able to decipher data even with the supposedly secure encryption to make it private.
The documents indicated that the NSA, working with its British counterpart GCHQ, accomplished the feat by using supercomputers, court orders and some cooperation from technology companies. If the reports are accurate, the highly secretive program would defeat much of what is used to keep data secure and private on the Internet, from emails to chats to communications using smartphones.
IBM researchers said last year they had made advances in quantum computing that has the potential to outperform any existing supercomputer. The new type of computing uses information encoded into quantum bits or qubits, putting into use a theory that scientists have been discussing for decades. Quantum computing expands on the most basic piece of information that a typical computer understands -- a bit, and thereby can perform millions of calculations at once.

"James A. Donald"
 Hayek, and colorfully dramatized by     It is interesting that Ayn Rand, in Atlas Shrugged, made a plot line out of "Rearden Metal", a mostly-copper alloy said to have been developed by Henry Reardon over a period of 10 years.  I was never a Randian ("Randroid"), realizing I was a libertarian before even having heard of Rand.  Occasionally I have met libertarians who don't like the idea of "intellectual property".  It is quite true that the large majority (80%?) of US patents should be labelled as 'patent noise': patents unworthy of being granted, mostly because they are obvious to persons skilled in the area of the invention.  But I think most people, including many libertarians, are of the opinion that  _worthy_ inventors should be rewarded somehow.  The current US plan (harmonized with European laws in early 1990's) of granting a 20-year monopoly seems okay by me.
    Full disclosure:  I am an inventor, having invented the "semiconductor disk" in the summer of 1980 (Google "SemiDisk")    see the "non-patent references" in  (Google "Semidisk disk emulator")  and an infrared flashing device to turn red traffic lights to green traffic lights in 1990 (popularized by other manufacturers in the early 2000's), and most recently an isotope-modified optical fiber. See        I never attempted or intended to obtain a patent on the SemiDisk (I didn't think it was worthy of a patent:  It was 'obvious' to a person of ordinary skill in the area of computer-based electronics), nor my traffic-light changer.  In fact, in 1984 the Oregon Legislature made it illegal to possess or use a traffic light changer, and by early 2000's the Federal government made sales or use of such a device illegal.  See 18 U.S.C. 39.         Of course, my 'Assassination Politics' essay may ultimately be considered my most important 'invention', although I did not fully describe how it would be implemented.  (I knew in 1995 that the invention of some form of digital cash would be necessary, and Bitcoin partly fills that bill, especially anonymized with Zerocoin;  and the TOR network has made a major advance in implementing that idea.     )      And, while I was unaware of Tim May's 'anonymous assassination contracts' ('abhorrent markets') at the time I wrote the first part of the AP essay, I must give him credit for thinking of that concept.  (In 1995, my only knowledge of 'Tim May' was that he had been a famous Intel employee in Santa Clara California, at the time I was a highly NON-famous Intel employee in Aloha Oregon.  (Summer of 1980 to the first week of 1982).

We at TMRC use the term "hacker" only in its original meaning, someone who
applies ingenuity to create a clever result, called a "hack". The essence
of a "hack" is that it is done quickly, and is usually inelegant. It
accomplishes the desired goal without changing the design of the system it
is embedded in. Despite often being at odds with the design of the larger
system, a hack is generally quite clever and effective.   This original benevolent meaning stands in stark contrast to the later and
more commonly used meaning of a "hacker", typically as a person
who breaks into computer networks in order to steal or vandalize. Here at
TMRC, where the words "hack" and "hacker" originated and have been used
proudly since the late 1950s, we resent the misapplication of the
word to mean the committing of illegal acts. People who do those things are
better described by expressions such as "thieves", "password crackers". or
"computer vandals". They are certainly not true hackers, as they do not
understand the hacker ethic.  Also see the definition of "hacker" in the on-line version of the New Hacker's
Dictionary. Reference info related to TMRC

However, those Quakers' positions may have been erroneous, based on a misunderstanding of the relevant law.  A person may claim to be 'not guilty' based on the fact that he wasn't there, he didn't do it, etc.  But, he may also claim to be 'not guilty' because what he did didn't constitute a crime, or he was justified based on extenuating circumstances, or he was trying to prevent a bigger crime.
BTW, have you considered the implications of nuclear power, today?  Getting rid of the nuclear waste is still a problem, but now the big environmental problem is claimed to be 'global warming', or 'climate change', whatever they are calling it these days.  The typical twenty-something environmentalist can claim innocence (he was not around in the 1970's), but the building and operation of nuclear power plants was and is definitely a trade-off.  How many millions of tons of CO2 released into the atmosphere would have been avoided had people not deterred the construction of a more extensive nuclear power system?           Jim Bell

in the US court system, is there an equivalent of jury nullification
applied to a judicial ruling?
that is to say: is it possible to plead guilty, but a judge acting to
nullify a perceived unjust law, could find you not guilty?
Yes, the concept of 'jury nullification' exists in American law.   See   .    Unfortunately, courts generally take the position that while jurors have the right to acquit regardless of the evidence, judges are not obliged to inform the jurors of that right.  Worse, judges usually take the position that they can order defense attorneys to not inform jurors of those jurors' rights on this subject.  See  A judge can also declare a defendant 'not guilty', despite a guilty verdict by a jury:  This is called "Judgment notwithstanding the verdict", abbreviated (from Latin, I believe) "j.n.o.v.".                 Jim Bell

Dear Mr. Greenberg, Forbes Magazine
     You've been mighty silent, not sending me a single email since the one (November 18, 2013) which is quoted below.    Apart from correcting your egregious error, claiming that I had fired "all" of my attorneys (when in fact I hadn't been successful at firing even a single one!), I also quote below my accusations against government employees in regard to phony, fake, forged 'appeal' case 99-30210, as well as my more recent allegations (albeit of a much older event) concerning the government sneakily commandeering the address 7302 Corregidor, in order to spy on me.  The average 'journalist', at least ones that actually consider themselves to be real journalists, would be very interested in this kind of material.  But you are not even interested enough to ask simple follow-up questions.  Why is that?  I think I know the answer:  You consider yourself, now, aligned with precisely the people who committed these crimes against me during the
 period of 1995 through 2013.  You yourself admitted in an article to having contacted the government:  Alone that would not necessarily be a problem, but I think you realized that if you did any effort to help expose the government guys, they would be hostile to you.   That's why you haven't investigated, and that's why nearly two months later you haven't even emailed to me,, despite the fact that I previously cc'd this material to you.  Perhaps you are terrified that some day soon, you will yourself be the center of a scandal, "What did Andy Greenberg know, and when did he know it, and why didn't he investigate further?".           Jim Bell

    One clue would come from my suspicion that agents of the Federal government, in March 1995, lured away the former resident of 7302 Corregidor (see    ), the house immediately to the east of mine, and bought that house.  (In the picture provided, my house at 7214 Corregidor is just to the left of the house shown.)   The prior resident was a local school (high school?) science teacher, and he was hired at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratories in Richland Washington, a Federal government laboratory akin to Oak Ridge, Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, etc.         The purpose of this was to be able to acquire that house, and use it as a spying location against me. (The names ostensibly buying the house were Daniel J. and Dori J. Saban, and they ran a remodeling operation named "Sundown Development Construction Corporation".     )   Note that the date the house was sold is shown as March 10, 1995.  (This is odd, because school teachers' lives are oriented around the 'school year', which in most locations in America go from about September 1 to about June 1.  They sign contracts with the school to work for that year, and are bound to do so.   While I don't recall when the prior, lured occupant left, based on the sale date it appears that he sold that house months before the end of his school year.  For a school teacher, this would have been highly unusual.)       The sale price is shown as $180,000, which I think was rather high for that time. (But not unexpected if the government wanted to lure him away quickly.  Presumably he got a large raise, as well.)  They immediately began an extensive remodeling and enlargement operation on that house, including adding a second floor.  As I recall, this remodel took nearly a year; seemingly the house was unoccupied during that time.  Further, during a long period very little work was actually being done, as I recall.  (This remodeling would have dramatically increased the value of that house; the sale price in 1995 of $180,000 cannot be directly compared with the current value of the much-larger and more-up-to-date house as it exists today.)
    While I don't remember precisely the date I published the first part
 of my AP essay, I believe that it was no
 more than a few weeks prior to March 10, 1995, on the 'Digitaliberty' discussion area.       (Hence my reference to Digitaliberty in the essay; it wasn't until many weeks later that I'd heard of the 'Cypherpunks' list.)  My recollection that the person who initiated 'Digitaliberty', Bill Frezza, was interested in the use of technology for the development of 'liberty', although the first part of my AP essay apparently exceeded his tolerance for radicalism.  At some point somebody transported Part 1 of the AP essay to Cypherpunks, and informed me of the existence of CP; I acquired Internet access and joined the Cypherpunks list.
    The acquisition and operation of nearby government spy locations was/is certainly not new.  Consider the case of Robert Hanssen,         While this Wikipedia article does not mention it, I read contemporaneously various news reports (2001) that said the government set up a spy location near Hanssen's house.  How far away that location was, those reports did not say.   Presumably, this was a standard tactic, and non-controversial. (At least in the case of actual criminality being suspected and investigated.)  The difference, in my case, was that not only did they not suspect me of any crime, they knew that I was innocent of any crime.  It is obvious, therefore, that they engaged in this activity not because of any crime (which, had it existed, would have made me a 'criminal') but because of my writing and publication of Part 1 of my Assassination Politics essay.  (Which made me 'an enemy', 'a dissident', an opponent of not merely the Federal government, but all governments everywhere.)  In other words, the government engaged in activities more appropriate for the former Soviet Union, and seemingly not for America.      One question that should be asked, is:  "What what the government did, acquiring that house at surveilling me from it, legal?"   They would presumably say, "yes".  But why wasn't that "stalking", within the meaning of the criminal statute?  After all, in November 21, 2000 I was accused of "Interstate Stalking", simply for going around, looking at various locations, not confronting (nor even seeing) anyone.  I was investigating things, because I knew that something was (and had been) happening.  Was I less entitled to do what I did, than what the government was to do what it did?  An inmate/informant named Ryan Thomas Lund (his recent activity:    )  was instructed to attack me, which he did on November 25, 1997, because I was beginning to resist the plea agreement that I had been offered, and initially accepted.
    Don't think that I didn't already suspect the house at 7302 Corregidor during that time.  In fact, I informed my (corrupt) attorney Peter Avenia    of some of my suspicions.  (But, of course, I didn't know at that time Avenia was corrupt.)  Sometime about December 1, 1997, Avenia visited me at FDC Seatac jail and I told him of Lund's attack.  His answer?  "I don't know anything about.....that")  (Avenia was also Lund's attorney.)   And in about July 1998, after I was re-arrested, ostensibly for a 'supervised release violation', the prosecutor Robb London (who is currently the direction of communication at Harvard Law School    ) claimed that I 'said that the government was spying on him' [Jim Bell].   Which, of course, was true:  I DID suspect, and say, that the government was spying on me!   Problem is, London was using this bare assertion to justify me being sent to the Federal Medical Center at Springfield, Missouri, for a mental evaluation (!).  Another problem was, London didn't say I was _wrong_ when I said (or suspected) that.  (Without at least an allegation that I was wrong, what justification is it to claim that I asserted that the government was spying on me?!?  Is merely saying that I believed the government was spying on me enough to justify sending me to a mental evaluation?  Would an American's "suspecting" that all his telephone metadata and email was being copied by the NSA, prior to Snowden's allegations, constitute a justification to send that 'comrade' for a mental evaluation in Siberia...er...Springfield?)    And worse, I was not allowed to challenge the (implicit) allegation of falsity in my assertion that the government had been spying on me.  However, I used the situation (a hearing) to extract a promise (only partly kept) from Avenia that he would investigate my allegations.  Many months later, perhaps in February 1999, Avenia send investigator Sharon Callas to Vancouver.  Mysteriously, Callas was said to have 'disappeared' (or perhaps 'resigned') later.  I never saw the results of her investigation.  Later, in about April 1999, attorney Avenia resigned, but NOT at my request.  I suspected then, and still suspect today, that his resignation was triggered by something that Sharon Callas discovered during that investigation:  Perhaps she confirmed enough of my allegations that Avenia knew that I was correct.        
     So, what had been going on?  Presumably, the interest in me (including local spying) was NOT based on allegations of crime, or even suspected future crime, in March 1995.  In other words, no government law enforcement agency would have been legally entitled to spy on me.  Presumably, the spying that did occur was, itself, illegal:  And, had it become exposed (which it should have been if I had not been assaulted by Ryan Thomas Lund on November 25, 1997), the Federal government would have suffered an enormous hit of bad publicity.  This corruption must have been at an extremely high level:  The forgery of fake appeal case 99-30210, initiated secretly and kept from me for 10 months, with numerous forged documents filed (at least two ostensibly being from me, but they were also forged:  You can see them on PACER:       9th circuit court.  One was docketed about November 10, 1999 and the other was docketed about March 4, 2000:   Both dates by my recollection).   That would have taken the cooperation of some very powerful people in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, possibly including a few judges.   Further, every document filed in that case, from June 1999 through April 2000, was (illegally) not delivered to me when I was at FDC Seatac (until September 3, 1999) and when I was at FCI Phoenix from September 10, 1999 to my release on April 13, 2000.  Indeed, there were at least two pieces of certified mail described in the docket for case 99-30210 that were mailed to my then-correct address at FCI Phoenix, which didn't get to me, presumably they were stolen by BOP staff at FCI Phoenix.   (Not to mention my allegation that this entire docket was RE-forged once they learned that I had requested an appeal that I hadn't known was already in progress.)
     Doesn't this begin to sound like the classic "government conspiracy" that people who don't like to talk about "government conspiracies" argue don't happen.  (Except rarely, say the Watergate incident in 1972).  One of the reasons that I look (way) down on a few of the doofuses around here (CP list) who don't seem to 'like' me is that they apparently take that position without taking the trouble to read my 2003 lawsuit (02-1052; Portland Federal Court) and learning what I allege the government and its minions did.  It will be interesting to see if any of them step up, apologize, and say, "Sorry, Mr. Bell, we didn't      Jim Bell                   I had hoped for a quicker response to my emails to you, and by that I don't mean merely my request for you to file a FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) filing with the National Archives, specifically the San Bruno facility near San Francisco.   The way I see it, you used what looked (and still looks) like a false and contrived set of excuses ('Bell fired practically every court-appointed lawyer ever assigned to him', and 'Bell had filed fifty-one lawsuits against the government while in prison',  and 'little wonder Bell had botched his appeals', to paraphrase your writing)   in order to justify not looking into my very serious set of accusations.   Well, those excuses won't wash anymore.
And just a few days ago, you said that your boss wouldn't be interested in you writing a story about my numerous accusations against the Federal government and its personnel!  How believable is that?  You wrote and published that article about 'Sanjuro', and I suspect within just a few hours it seems like every other reporter in the world followed that story!  (To exaggerate only a little.)   Right now, your most recent story portrayed the Federal government as being the victims, those being offended against, the 'good guys'.   But I know that's not the case.  What happens when the public finds out that they:
1.    Had a thug snitch, Ryan Thomas Lund, assault me on November 25, 1997, in order to extort a 'guilty' plea from me?
2.    Forged a phony 'appeal', 99-30210, during the period June 1999-April 2000?  3.    And, moreover, RE-forged it in May 2000?
4.    Inflict a series of corrupt attorneys on me, the very same set of attorneys you falsely claimed I had 'fired'.
5.    Victimized me by yet more false charges November 2000.
And that's just a start.
Can you say with a straight face that the public won't be interested in this pile of corruption, given the extensive and virtually instantaneous publicity already given to 'Sanjuro', and indirectly to my AP essay? (Not only by you, but practically everyone else, it seems.)   Don't even try to suggest that your boss won't 'allow' it:  If he's smart he will DEMAND it from you, or he will assign someone else who doesn't have a conflict of interest.  Yes, I said it:  A conflict of interest.   You seriously mishandled your contact with me, and moreover for personal reasons:  You were writing a book.  Having written so misleadingly and negligently, when you learned about 'Sanjuro' no doubt you hesitated to cover the full, actual truth about what the government has done.    That will only _not_ reflect badly on Forbes if you either fix your own problems promptly, or you get replaced so that an unconflicted person takes up covering the story.  Since you're now well-aware that the events of my case were spectacular, and were so long before 'Sanjuro' showed up,  your failure to cover the story at those points (2011, 2012; much of 2013) is incriminating.

Mr Greenberg,
      I will continue about the history of 'my' attorneys, who were 'my' attorneys in name only:  They were actually the attorneys of "The United States of America", and of their colluding employees.    While I would like to say that my 'next' attorney was Jonathan Solovy, given the paperwork I should first deal with a couple of 'asterisks', named Catherine Floit and David Bukey.
    At some point after I wrote that letter to the Ninth Circuit Court, I received a letter (about June 2000?) from an attorney named Catherine Floit.  I called her by telephone, and I explained a bit about the history of prior attorneys Peter Avenia and Judith Mandel.  I further explained that I had very, very serious suspicions about government corruption by these attorneys, and the government in general.  I said that I would be suing those attorneys, and any other people who assisted the government corruption I then suspected.  (Note:  Remember, at that point, I did not know about the pre-April existence of phony, forged Ninth Circuit Court appeal 99-30210.)  I was surprised when that phone call to Catherine Floit didn't last very long after that!  (A minute?)
    'What happened?', I thought!  It turns out that Floit later contacted the people who had appointed her (the Public Defenders' Office in Seattle Washington, I think.) and asked to be de-assigned to my case.  I later heard that she CLAIMED (quite falsely) that I had 'threatened' her!   But I hadn't threatened her at all!  I had no reason to do so, particularly at that early stage in her representation.  But at this point I knew very little about the law.   Eventually (a few years later, after I first saw the docket for the forged appeal case 99-30210, in late June 2003; see Jonathan Solovy's 'representation', which I will shortly write about) I realized that Floit must have been informed about the fact that the case she had been assigned to handle, 99-30210, was ALREADY a fraud, and in my phone call with her she learned that I was rather well-informed about the corruption of those two prior attorneys, Avenia and Mandel, AND that I intended to
 sue them, etc.  In other words, she understood that if she took that case, and if she did what the government wanted her to do, she herself was almost certainly going to get sued, and for exactly the kinds of things that Avenia and Mandel were already 'in the crosshairs' for having done in the past.
    When an attorney is ASSIGNED a case (by a judge or a court) it's fairly hard to 'get out of it'.  Such an attorney has to have a rather 'good' (but not necessarily, 'valid') reason to be relieved of that responsibility.  Floit (I realized, years later) could not have simply said, "Jim Bell is on to them/us!!!  He's going to sue us!".   Floit could not have said, "The government is engaging in corruption against Bell, and I don't want to be part of it!".    So, what was she going to do?   It turns out that the easiest way for her to get out of the assignment was to (falsely) claim, "Jim Bell threatened me!!!".   Which she, apparently, did.  But I DIDN'T threaten her.  But that didn't matter:  Floit's mere allegation amounted to a "Get out of representation free" card, analogous to Monopoly's "Get out of jail free" card.  She was not obligated to actually prove I'd done anything:  No proof was required, or even requested.  The
 allegation itself was quite enough.  As she, no doubt, knew quite well.
     A few weeks later, another attorney (David Bukey) was assigned, but I didn't hear of that.  I was not given any notification that Bukey had been assigned:  Apparently Bukey heard of his assignment, refused it, and he never contacted me.  Nor did anyone else contact me, either, on any subject, including that of Bukey or his (brief) assignment to my case.   During this time, I wrote yet another letter to the Ninth Circuit Court basically asking, "Where's my representation?".
Notice, now, that the count is up to FOUR:  Avenia, Mandel, Floit, and Bukey:  None of these attorneys did I ever attempt to 'fire'.  (And I didn't even learn that Bukey was supposed to be representing me, until after he had been relieved of that.)   The closest to even 'attempting to fire' I had done was when I tried to prevent Avenia from being relieved, because I didn't want his successor (who turned out to be Mandel: I didn't want anybody assigned, because I had already gotten promises from Avenia to do investigation, which eventually he never effectively did) to be assigned.    But at that, I was unsuccessful at both, of course.
Jonathan Solovy:
    Eventually, Solovy was assigned to case 99-30210, as I vaguely recall in about August 2000.  Keep in mind that I STILL didn't know about the pre-May-2000 existence of case 99-30210 as of then:  I would only learn of that pre-May-2000 existence when I wrote for, and received, the docket for 99-30210 in late June 2003.
    Solovy didn't do anything OBVIOUSLY wrong.  At least, I didn't recognize that in 2000.  He wrote the appeal, 99-30210, filed it, and it lost. I think he may also have written a Petition for Certiorari to the Supreme Court, which also obviously failed.   (I don't recall what they contained; I didn't learn the law until beginning December 2000).   But I can say this much:  At no time during Solovy's representation did he EVER say to me anything that would have alerted me to the pre-May-2000 existence of case 99-30210.  I may not have known much (or even 'anything') about Federal law in September, 2000, but if he had said something like "Jim, I see you've been assigned pro-se to this appeal since July 1999:  What are your theories as to appealing this case?"  I would have been alerted, with a distinct start, and I would have instantly asked him, "What do you mean?   I thought I began this case in April 2000, when I wrote a letter to the Ninth
 Circuit Court of Appeals?  What's this about July 1999?!?".
     By the time I first saw a copy of the docket for case 99-30210, on about June 20, 2003, I knew FAR more Federal law.  I'd spent since about December 2000 in a jail/prison law library.  In fact, two of the REASONS I wrote to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in early June 2003, asking for the docket for 99-30210, were:
1.    Clearing up loose ends for my Portland Federal Court lawsuit, 02-1052, I remembered that I had (thought!) initiated that appeal (99-30210) by means of mailing a letter to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, asking for an appeal.  (In case 97-5270, as I recall).  As of June 2003, I understood that the rules required that to appeal, somebody needs to file a 'Notice of Appeal' within about two weeks of the date of the order-entry.  My letter of April 2000 was, I then realized, nearly ten (10) months too late to initiate an appeal in that case.  "So why," I thought, "wasn't that letter immediately rejected?!?"   and "Why did they give me that appeal?"
2.    At some point, I recognized that the case-number of that appeal (99-30210) started with the number, "99", which stands for "1999", the date that appeal was initiated.  In other words, I eventually realized (June 2003) that that appeal had been begun in 1999, NOT in 2000.   Evidently, my letter of April 2000 DIDN'T 'start the ball rolling' on that appeal.
    Therefore, and being quite suspicious, I wrote a bland, routine note in early June 2003 to the Ninth Circuit, asking for the copy of the docket for case 99-30210, which I had never seen before.  I received an envelope about June 20, 2003, containing a copy of that docket.  The most obvious thing that struck me about that docket was that case 99-30210 DIDN'T start in April 2000, as I had previously assumed.  It was quite clear, instead that it had begun in July 1999.  (Although, the 'Notice of Appeal' had actually been filed about June 20, 1999).   Something VERY VERY suspicious had been going on!  Secondly, I looked through the various docket entries, and I could see that this case had appeared to have been active:  Ostensibly, I had actually been 'pro se' (representing myself) which I knew that I hadn't been doing!  (because, of course, I hadn't even known about the existence of that case, prior to May 2000, thinking I initiated it with a
 letter to the Ninth Circuit in late April 2000).   In fact, I could see that there were two filings, about November 10, 1999, and March 2, 2000, which purported to have been filed by me!  (And, obviously, I knew that I hadn't filed them!)  Most importantly, I realized that I had not received ANY of these many mailings while I was at Seatac FDC (until Sept 3, 1999) nor any while I was at Phoenix FCI (From Sept 10, 1999 though April 13, 2000, when I was released; I was at the Oklahoma City Federal Transfer Center for a week from Sept 3 to Sept 10, 1999.)
    Note:  I received NONE of the mailings from the Ninth Circuit Court during July 1999 through April 2000, because the Bureau of Prisons staff at both those locations hid them from me.  (Did not deliver them to me).  If I had received EVEN ONE of those mailings, I would have been alerted that an appeal existed.  I didn't receive even a single one.  Of course, I wasn't EXPECTING a single one, either, because I was not then aware that appeal 99-30210 existed.
    But there was more.   I looked at the docket item numbers at the middle of the docket pages (between the dates on the left, and the descriptions of the entries on the right) and I noticed that they were not all there.  Some were out of order (I later understood that merely being out of order is not abnormal) but 29 of the first 79 docket entry numbers simply were not present!   Since I already knew there had to be a dramatic amount of corruption associated with this case, I considered that a very significant clue.  Later, weeks and months later, I showed this docket to numerous 'jailhouse lawyers', and to a person, they said they had never seen even a single 'missing' docket entry number on any dockets they had ever seen.  Over the subsequent years, I also looked at any docket I could get my hands on, and never once was I able to identify even a single 'missing' docket entry number on any docket.
    An explanation is in order.  I believe that in about May 2000, some of the staff of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals engaged in a 'forgery party' of the docket for case 99-30210.  I think that they realized that they could not deny me an appeal in that probation-revocation case, BECAUSE THEY HAD ALREADY GIVEN ME THAT APPEAL!  But, they also realized that they couldn't simply continue on with that forgery, because they knew that I DIDN'T KNOW of the existence of appeal 99-30210 during the time of June 1999 through April 2000.  They knew that they couldn't simply initiate a new appeal, because a record of appeal 99-30210 already existed.  They also knew that they couldn't allow me to see a copy of the docket for 99-30210, because that would have alerted me (just as it eventually alerted me in June 2003) that the appeal had existed, yet had been concealed from me during the period June 1999 through April 2000.  What they had to do, I think,
 was to RE-forge that docket, which they did in May 2000, and then assign a colluding attorney (First Floit, then Bukey, then Solovy) who would help conceal the history of this case from me, and then write a serviceable 'appeal', so that it could lose:  Their hope, apparently, was that I would be satisfied with that.  And until June 2003, I was indeed 'satisfied'.
     Perhaps a couple months after I first saw that copy of the docket for case 99-30210, I wrote a letter to Jonathan Solovy.  (He had never been 'de-assigned' to my case).   I don't recall,  precisely, what I said (It's been 10 years!), but I asked him to look into into the problem.  His response?  Well, suddenly he had developed 'carpal tunnel syndrome' (I was well aware of that condition) and he couldn't handle my case anymore!   I insisted; He wrote to the judge, asking that he be allowed to withdraw.  Actually, I think he wrote to the WRONG judge!   I think he wrote to Judge Burgess, of the District Court case, 97-5270, NOT the Ninth Circuit appeals court  (99-30210).  But it didn't matter:  he was allowed to withdraw.
    Please note:  Jonathan Solovy was my FIFTH attorney, if you are counting Avenia, Mandel, Floit, and Bukey before him.  And note that I didn't try to get Solovy, either, 'fired'.  Indeed, yet again I wanted to see Solovy to continue to handle that case (99-30210) in large part BECAUSE I knew that he had committed fraud against me and, kinda-sorta, against the court as well.  But, Solovy's fraud was in league with the U.S. Attorneys (Seattle), the Federal Bureau of Prisons staff at FDC Seatac, and at FCI Phoenix, and the staff of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and possibly others.
    So, where did you come up with that claim that I fired "all" of my attorneys, HMMMMMMMM?????????   Sorry if I display a little schadenfreude, but I think I've earned the right to complain.    And I still haven't yet mentioned attorney Robert Leen, and Annemarie Levins, either!!!   I'll talk about them next.

 and an A/D convertor.  In operation, the resistance between these solder-bumps would be measured by the chip; also, perhaps two or more different solder bumps could be driven by the chip to different voltages (Vcc and Gnd), and the voltages of the rest of the solder bumps would be measured.  These as-measured values could be transmitted through the USB (possibly in encrypted or hashed form) and stored by a connected computer.    The entire device would be potted in a clear potting material, probably clear epoxy.  Any tampering would be automatically detectable electronically, and it would be exceedingly difficult to replicate the results of the large number of possible separate measurements which could be made.
There would be (16x15/2)= 120 two-terminal resistance values; Each such measured value could be accompanied by measuring the voltage of the other 14 terminals, or 120 x 14 = 1680
 values.

Oh, why not?
On checking Wikipedia, I learned that "tontine" has meant different things in history.   My initial exposure to 'tontine' was to watch the movie, "The Wrong Box" in 1966, representing the kind of tontine that fictional versions usually present:  A group of donors putting money into a fund, eventually being paid to the last survivor of the group.   I recall one of the (funny!) scenes from that movie, where the two last survivors are in a room, with one tottering about the room trying to kill the other, but failing.
If I understand this new operation, it's not precisely like any tontine that the Wikipedia article described.      But each person running a system such as this will generally make new rules.
I should probably take the time to say, yet again, that I am not involved in any way with either of these two efforts, nor do I know the persons or people involved with either.
Some kind of inventiveness is to be expected here.  'Sanjuro's system involves names and amounts-per-name.  Quite a vanilla approach.  But on learning of that system a couple of months ago, and being aware of the fate of Silk Road 1.0, and the prompt arrival of Silk Road 2.0    , it occurred to me that if the operators of Silk Road 2.0 wanted to assist their security and that of their users, they might protect themselves using an 'AM'-type of system.  After all, it is said that SR1.0 sold $1.2 billion of merchandise (mostly illegal?) over a period of two years.  Consider what would happen if the operators had dedicated a 1% "security tax" on such transactions, or ultimately a total of $12 million.  Could they dedicate that amount, targeted not to specific names, but to be targeted at 'any judge involved in a SR2.0 prosecution', 'any prosecutor involved in a SR2.0 prosecution',
 or 'any investigator involved in a SR2.0 prosecution'?   (For purposes of concreteness, say hypothetically $500K per judge, $250K per prosecutor, and $100K per investigator.  So, the amount of $12 million described above could, therefore, fund about 10 different SR2.0-anti-prosecution cases.) In other words, pre-authorize the 'AM'-type system operator to name the target as soon as that name becomes known.   One advantage of such a plan to the participants is that their donations would be more likely to see prompt usage, and would therefore more immediately deter anyone who was in a position to decide whether or not to investigate, prosecute, or judge such a case.
There is yet another possible tactic, which I have given the humorous name, "Jury Booty".  What if this hypothetical 'AM'-type system is contracted to announce that it would pay a fixed dollar amount, for concreteness let's say $100K, to be distributed evenly to any portion of any jury who votes 'not guilty' to a Silk Road 2.0 case?  In other words, the money would be split only among those jurors who vote 'not guilty'.  This tactic would have the advantage that it would represent as much as a $100K deterrent to a conviction, to be paid to any lone hold-out juror who decides to break with the rest of the jury.  (Although, despite America's 5th Amendment double-jeopardy clause, the reality is that re-prosecution may be done if the vote to acquit is not unanimous.  Therefore, the payment might have to be repeated in a subsequent trial, etc.)  Authorities, no doubt, would want to label this 'jury tampering'.  
    However, it is likely that if no actual 'offer' is made to a specific juror, and  'everybody' simply KNOWS that these payments will occur (due to prior advertising and other publicity, and because other jurors have always been paid in the past), this should not run afoul of such laws.   One reason that these tactics would be particularly effective with a Silk-Road 2.0-type system is that they would likely reduce the risk of participating in such sales and purchases.  The high prices of illegal drugs is a product of the risk involved in their manufacture, distribution, sales, and purchase.  If such risks are dramatically reduced, the overall cost for such drugs could drop by a factor of 2, or much more.  A potential illegal-drug purchaser should consider a 1% 'tax' worthwhile if it drops the price of his purchase by 50%.  See Game Theory,                Jim Bell

The exact wording of the laws is important.  A given state's law may refer to 'during a trial', a factor which need not be present in a hypothetical case.  Strictly speaking, it would be a statement that they WILL make a payment, NOT that they 'offer' to do so.  The exact wording of the laws is important.  Moreover, TIMING is important as well.  See the following case:     That was a jury-nullification leafletting case.     "U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said the tampering statute was aimed at people who try to influence a decision in a specific case, the New York Times reports. The defendant, 80-year-old Julian Heicklen, was arrested for passing out brochures advocating the idea that jurors can acquit defendants if they disagree with the laws used to prosecute them.According to the Times, Wood avoided a First Amendment ruling by basing her decision on the reach of the statute. But an Associated Press story says Wood mentioned the First Amendment in her decision, saying it protects speech concerning judicial proceedings as long as the speech doesn’t prevent fair and impartial justice".
I have read some jury tampering decisions which quote laws which prohibit such offers DURING a trial, not days, weeks, months, or even years ahead of time.  What I was referring to was a practice where it would become generally know, months or even years in advance, that such a payment would be made.  This is NOT the heartland of a 'jury tampering' case.  Also,  Also, see the 1969 Supreme Court case, Brandenburg v. Ohio.    The SC ruled that mere advocacy of a future criminal action (not 'imminent lawless action', as in a riot situation) is 'protected speech' under the 1st amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
See also:   I view existing 'justice' as being entirely perverted, already.  See   In any case, I did not publicize these actions with the intent that somebody rush out and do it, without further legal research.  Obviously, individual states' laws should be checked.  And, if necessary, a lawsuit can be brought, alleging that the complainant wishes to commence a given course of action, and challenging the government to prove that this action is necessarily illegal.  I suspect that if no direct contact with individual jurors occurs, and this is part of a long-standing campaign over a period of months or years, this cannot be described as 'jury tampering' within the meaning of current laws.               Jim Bell

As you might have seen from a comment of mine on the Cypherpunks list nearly two months ago, my main criticism of 'Sanjuro's system is that it is apparently limited to a minimum donation of 1.0 Bitcoin, or (currently) about 864 dollars.  I have hesitated to carefully study that system to understand why the minimum is there (for reasons that should be obvious!), but it may be because donations are totalized manually.  I predicted that this limitation would strongly deter anybody from donating, and I suspect that this phenomenon has occurred over the last 1.8 months.  People should be aware that it is possible to file a lawsuit to challenge the anticipated claim of illegality of any such system.  Although, the person or people who file that lawsuit should probably not have any connection with any currently-operating 'prediction market'.  Effectively, the lawsuit should allege that there are people who would operate such a system, believe it to be legal, but are currently deterred from running that system due to a reasonable fear that some government would label it as being 'illegal'.  (And, have a reasonable fear that the government will use illegal or fraudulent tactics to victimize such operators.)   The purpose of this lawsuit would be to force 'the government' to "put up or shut up":  To prove either that the system need not be, or alternatively must be, illegal.  The burden of the latter's proof will be on the government, presumably the Federal government of the United States.             Jim Bell

John, I don't discourage your comments such as this.  Caution must always be employed.  But as Freud said, "Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar".  Cypherpunks sometimes talk about 'scary' subjects.  Imagine if, hypothetically, Phil Zimmerman (who created PGP) had been a Cypherpunk list member in, say, 1990.  (Yes, I know the list didn't exist until 1992...)  Suppose he had said, "Gee, somebody could write a program using RSA algorithms, that even the NSA couldn't crack!"      Then, another list member could say, "Well, somebody else could post it on a U.S. website, and it could be downloaded by a person in a foreign country!"    And a third listmember could chime in: "And thereby crypto could be exported, ILLEGALLY, and nobody would know who did it!" .    Similar kinds of discussions could be imagined about the
 development of thwarting the Clipper chip, imagining AP or (now) 'Sanjuro's 'AM',  designing Bitcoin, or about setting up a Silk Road-type website, or anything else that somebody might consider provocative.  All of the persons reading the CP list need to learn about the 1969 Supreme Court case, Brandenburg v. Ohio.      Text of that case at:        Talking about a crime, and even openly advocating its commission (with the exception of 'imminent lawless action') is generally considered protected by the 1st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  That said, I generally make it a rule not to "openly advocate the commission of a crime", mostly because government investigators and even prosecutors may not be aware of the rights described in the Brandenburg case:  Or, a prosecutor may PRETEND to not realize that such open advocacy is not, in itself, beyond 1st Amendment protection, at least not until he has already obtained a search warrant, investigators have planted evidence, made an arrest, etc.   But, over time, I believe that we (and all other citizens) should come to regularly use all the Constitutional protections we have, in part to ensure that some of us aren't victimized by using a seldom-used right.            Jim Bell  For a comedic take on this theme, see:

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF OHIO Syllabus Appellant, a Ku Klux Klan leader, was convicted under the Ohio Criminal Syndicalism statute for
"advocat[ing] . . . the duty, necessity, or propriety of crime, sabotage, violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform"
and for
"voluntarily assembl[ing] with any society, group or assemblage of persons formed to teach or advocate the doctrines of criminal Neither the indictment nor the trial judge's instructions refined the statute's definition of the crime in terms of mere advocacy not distinguished from incitement to imminent lawless action.
Held: Since the statute, by its words and as applied, purports to punish mere advocacy and to forbid, on pain of criminal punishment, assembly with others merely to advocate the described type of action, it falls within the condemnation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Freedoms of speech and press do not permit a State to forbid advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, overruled.
PER CURIAM.
The appellant, a leader of a Ku Klux Klan group, was convicted under the Ohio Criminal Syndicalism statute for "advocat[ing] . . . the duty, necessity, or propriety Page 395 U. S. 445
of crime, sabotage, violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform" and for
"voluntarily assembl[ing] with any society, group, or assemblage of persons formed to teach or advocate the doctrines of criminal Ohio Rev.Code Ann. § 2923.13.  He was fined $1,000 and sentenced to one to 10 years' imprisonment.  The appellant challenged the constitutionality of the criminal syndicalism statute under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, but the intermediate appellate court of Ohio affirmed his conviction without opinion.  The Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed his appeal sua sponte "for the reason that no substantial constitutional question exists herein."  It did not file an opinion or explain its conclusions.  Appeal was taken to this Court, and we noted probable jurisdiction. 393 U. S. 94 (196).  We reverse.
The record shows that a man, identified at trial as the appellant, telephoned an announcer-reporter on the staff of a Cincinnati television station and invited him to come to a Ku Klux Klan "rally" to be held at a farm in Hamilton County.  With the cooperation of the organizers, the reporter and a cameraman attended the meeting and filmed the events.  Portions of the films were later broadcast on the local station and on a national network.
The prosecution's case rested on the films and on testimony identifying the appellant as the person who communicated with the reporter and who spoke at the rally.  The State also introduced into evidence several articles appearing in the film, including a pistol, a rifle, a shotgun, ammunition, a Bible, and a red hood worn by the speaker in the films.
One film showed 12 hooded figures, some of whom carried firearms.  They were gathered around a large wooden cross, which they burned.  No one was present Page 395 U. S. 446
other than the participants and the newsmen who made the film.  Most of the words uttered during the scene were incomprehensible when the film was projected, but scattered phrases could be understood that were derogatory of Negroes and, in one instance, of Jews. [Footnote 1]  Another scene on the same film showed the appellant, in Klan regalia, making a speech.  The speech, in full, was as follows:
"This is an organizers' meeting.  We have had quite a few members here today which are -- we have hundreds, hundreds of members throughout the State of Ohio.  I can quote from a newspaper clipping from the Columbus, Ohio, Dispatch, five weeks ago Sunday morning.  The Klan has more members in the State of Ohio than does any other organization.  We're not a revengent organization, but if our President, our Congress, our Supreme Court, continues to suppress the white, Caucasian race, it's possible that there might have to be some revengeance taken."
"We are marching on Congress July the Fourth, four hundred thousand strong.  From there, we are dividing into two groups, one group to march on St. Augustine, Florida, the other group to march into Mississippi.  Thank you.  "
Page 395 U. S. 447
The second film showed six hooded figures one of whom, later identified as the appellant, repeated a speech very similar to that recorded on the first film.  The reference to the possibility of "revengeance" was omitted, and one sentence was added:  "Personally, I believe the nigger should be returned to Africa, the Jew returned to Israel."  Though some of the figures in the films carried weapons, the speaker did not.
The Ohio Criminal Syndicalism Statute was enacted in 1919.  From 1917 to 1920, identical or quite similar laws were adopted by 20 States and two territories.  E. Dowell, A History of Criminal Syndicalism Legislation in the United States 21 (1939).  In 1927, this Court sustained the constitutionality of California's Criminal Syndicalism Act, Cal.Penal Code §§ 11400-11402, the text of which is quite similar to that of the laws of Ohio. Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357 (1927).  The Court upheld the statute on the ground that, without more, "advocating" violent means to effect political and economic change involves such danger to the security of the State that the State may outlaw it. Cf. Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U. S. 380 (1927).  But Whitney has been thoroughly discredited by later decisions. See Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494, at 341 U. S. 507 (1951).  These later decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. [Footnote 2]  As we Page 395 U. S. 448
said in Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290, 367 U. S. 297-298 (1961),
"the mere abstract teaching . . . of the moral propriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence is not the same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action."
See also Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U. S. 242, 301 U. S. 259-261 (1937); Bond v. Floyd, 385 U. S. 116, 385 U. S. 134 (1966).  A statute which fails to draw this distinction impermissibly intrudes upon the freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  It sweeps within its condemnation speech which our Constitution has immunized from governmental control. Cf. Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298 (1957); De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U. S. 353 (1937); Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359 (1931). See also United States v. Robel, 389 U. S. 258 (1967); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U. S. 589 (1967); Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U. S. 11 (1966); Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U. S. 500 (1964); Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360 (1964).
Measured by this test, Ohio's Criminal Syndicalism Act cannot be sustained.  The Act punishes persons who "advocate or teach the duty, necessity, or propriety" of violence "as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform"; or who publish or circulate or display any book or paper containing such advocacy; or who "justify" the commission of violent acts "with intent to exemplify, spread or advocate the propriety of the doctrines of criminal syndicalism"; or who "voluntarily assemble" with a group formed "to teach or advocate the doctrines of criminal syndicalism."  Neither the indictment nor the trial judge's instructions to the jury in any way refined the statute's bald definition of the crime Page 395 U. S. 449
in terms of mere advocacy not distinguished from incitement to imminent lawless action. [Footnote 3]
Accordingly, we are here confronted with a statute which, by its own words and as applied, purports to punish mere advocacy and to forbid, on pain of criminal punishment, assembly with others merely to advocate the described type of action. [Footnote 4]  Such a statute falls within the condemnation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The contrary teaching of Whitney v. California, supra, cannot be supported, and that decision is therefore overruled.
[Footnote 1]
The significant portions that could be understood were:
"How far is the nigger going to -- yeah."
"This is what we are going to do to the niggers."
"A dirty nigger."
"Send the Jews back to Israel."
"Let's give them back to the dark garden."
"Save America."
"Let's go back to constitutional betterment."
"Bury the niggers."
"We intend to do our part."
"Give us our state rights."
"Freedom for the whites."
"Nigger will have to fight for every inch he gets from now on."
[Footnote 2]
It was on the theory that the Smith Act, 54 Stat. 670, 18 U.S.C. § 35, embodied such a principle and that it had been applied only in conformity with it that this Court sustained the Act's constitutionality. Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494 (1951).  That this was the basis for Dennis was emphasized in Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298, 354 U. S. 320-324 (1957), in which the Court overturned convictions for advocacy of the forcible overthrow of the Government under the Smith Act, because the trial judge's instructions had allowed conviction for mere advocacy, unrelated to its tendency to produce forcible action.
[Footnote 3]
The first count of the indictment charged that appellant
"did unlawfully by word of mouth advocate the necessity, or propriety of crime, violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing political reform. . . ."
The second count charged that appellant "did unlawfully voluntarily assemble with a group or assemblage of persons formed to advocate the doctrines of criminal syndicalism. . . ."  The trial judge's charge merely followed the language of the indictment.  No construction of the statute by the Ohio courts has brought it within constitutionally permissible limits.  The Ohio Supreme Court has considered the statute in only one previous case, State v. Kassay, 126 Ohio St. 177, 184 N.E. 521 (1932), where the constitutionality of the statute was sustained.
[Footnote 4]
Statutes affecting the right of assembly, like those touching on freedom of speech, must observe the established distinctions between mere advocacy and incitement to imminent lawless action, for, as Chief Justice Hughes wrote in De Jonge v. Oregon, supra, at 299 U. S. 364:  "The right of peaceable assembly is a right cognate to those of free speech and free press, and is equally fundamental." See also United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 92 U. S. 552 (1876); Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496, 307 U. S. 513, 307 U. S. 519 (1939); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449, 357 U. S. 460-461 (1958).
MR. JUSTICE BLACK, concurring.
I agree with the views expressed by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS in his concurring opinion in this case that the "clear and present danger" doctrine should have no place Page 395 U. S. 450
in the interpretation of the First Amendment.  I join the Court's opinion, which, as I understand it, simply cites Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494 (1951), but does not indicate any agreement on the Court's part with the "clear and present danger" doctrine on which Dennis purported to rely.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.
While I join the opinion of the Court, I desire to enter a caveat.
The "clear and present danger" test was adumbrated by Mr. Justice Holmes in a case arising during World War I -- a war "declared" by the Congress, not by the Chief Executive.  The case was Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47, 249 U. S. 52, where the defendant was charged with attempts to cause insubordination in the military and obstruction of enlistment.  The pamphlets that were distributed urged resistance to the draft, denounced conscription, and impugned the motives of those backing the war effort.  The First Amendment was tendered as a defense.  Mr. Justice Holmes, in rejecting that defense, said:
"The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.  It is a question of proximity and Frohwerk v. United States, 249 U. S. 204, also authored by Mr. Justice Holmes, involved prosecution and punishment for publication of articles very critical of the war effort in World War I. Schenck was referred to as a conviction for obstructing security "by words of persuasion." Id. at 249 U. S. 206.  And the conviction in Frohwerk was sustained because "the circulation of the paper was Page 395 U. S. 451
in quarters where a little breath would be enough to kindle a flame." Id. at 249 U. S. 209.
Debs v. United States, 249 U. S. 211, was the third of the trilogy of the 1918 Term.  Debs was convicted of speaking in opposition to the war where his "opposition was so expressed that its natural and intended effect would be to obstruct recruiting." Id. at 249 U. S. 215.
"If that was intended, and if, in all the circumstances, that would be its probable effect, it would not be protected by reason of its being part of a general program and expressions of a general and conscientious belief."
In the 1919 Term, the Court applied the Schenck doctrine to affirm the convictions of other dissidents in World War I. Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616, was one instance.  Mr. Justice Holmes, with whom Mr. Justice Brandeis concurred, dissented.  While adhering to Schenck, he did not think that, on the facts, a case for overriding the First Amendment had been made out:
"It is only the present danger of immediate evil or an intent to bring it about that warrants Congress in setting a limit to the expression of opinion where private rights are not concerned.  Congress certainly cannot forbid all effort to change the mind of the country."
Id. at 250 U. S. 628.
Another instance was Schaefer v. United States, 251 U. S. 466, in which Mr. Justice Brandeis, joined by Mr. Justice Holmes, dissented.  A third was Pierce v. United States, 252 U. S. 239, in which, again, Mr. Justice Brandeis, joined by Mr. Justice Holmes, dissented.
Those, then, were the World War I cases that put the gloss of "clear and present danger" on the First Amendment.  Whether the war power -- the greatest leveler of them all -- is adequate to sustain that doctrine is debatable. Page 395 U. S. 452
The dissents in Abrams, Schaefer, and Pierce show how easily "clear and present danger" is manipulated to crush what Brandeis called "[t]he fundamental right of free men to strive for better conditions through new legislation and new institutions" by argument and discourse (Pierce v. United States, supra, at 252 U. S. 273) even in time of war.  Though I doubt if the "clear and present danger" test is congenial to the First Amendment in time of a declared war, I am certain it is not reconcilable with the First Amendment in days of The Court quite properly overrules Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, which involved advocacy of ideas which the majority of the Court deemed unsound and dangerous.
Mr. Justice Holmes, though never formally abandoning the "clear and present danger" test, moved closer to the First Amendment ideal when he said in dissent in Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652, 268 U. S. 673:
"Every idea is an incitement.  It offers itself for belief, and, if believed, it is acted on unless some other belief outweighs it or some failure of energy stifles the movement at its birth.  The only difference between the expression of an opinion and an incitement in the narrower sense is the speaker's enthusiasm for the result.  Eloquence may set fire to reason.  But whatever may be thought of the redundant discourse before us, it had no chance of starting a present conflagration.  If, in the long run, the beliefs expressed in proletarian dictatorship are destined to be accepted by the dominant forces of the community, the only meaning of free speech is that they should be given their chance and have their way."
We have never been faithful to the philosophy of that dissent. Page 395 U. S. 453
The Court, in Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U. S. 242, overturned a conviction for exercising First Amendment rights to incite insurrection because of lack of evidence of incitement. Id. at 301 U. S. 259-261. And see Hartzel v. United States, 322 U. S. 680.  In Bridges v. California, 314 U. S. 252, 314 U. S. 261-263, we approved the "clear and present danger" test in an elaborate dictum that tightened it and confined it to a narrow category.  But in Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494, we opened wide the door, distorting the "clear and present danger" test beyond recognition. [Footnote 2/1]
In that case, the prosecution dubbed an agreement to teach the Marxist creed a "conspiracy."  The case was submitted to a jury on a charge that the jury could not convict unless it found that the defendants "intended to overthrow the Government as speedily as circumstances would permit.'" Id. at 341 U. S. 509-511.  The Court sustained convictions under that charge, construing it to mean a determination of
""whether the gravity of the evil,' discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger." [Footnote 2/2]" Id. at 341 U. S. 510, quoting from United States v. Dennis, 183 F.2d 201, 212.
Out of the "clear and present danger" test came other offspring.  Advocacy and teaching of forcible overthrow of government as an abstract principle is immune from prosecution. Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298, 354 U. S. 318.  But an "active" member, who has a guilty knowledge and intent of the aim to overthrow the Government Page 395 U. S. 454
by violence, Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290, may be prosecuted. Scales v. United States, 367 U. S. 203, 367 U. S. 228. And the power to investigate, backed by the powerful sanction of contempt, includes the power to determine which of the two categories fits the particular witness. Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U. S. 109, 360 U. S. 130. And so the investigator roams at will through all of the beliefs of the witness, ransacking his conscience and his innermost thoughts.
Judge Learned Hand, who wrote for the Court of Appeals in affirming the judgment in Dennis, coined the "not improbable" test, 183 F.2d 201, 214, which this Court adopted and which Judge Hand preferred over the "clear and present danger" test.  Indeed, in his book, The Bill of Rights 59 (1958), in referring to Holmes' creation of the "clear and present danger" test, he said, "I cannot help thinking that, for once, Homer nodded."
My own view is quite different.  I see no place in the regime of the First Amendment for any "clear and present danger" test, whether strict and tight, as some would make it, or free-wheeling, as the Court in Dennis rephrased it.
When one reads the opinions closely and sees when and how the "clear and present danger" test has been applied, great misgivings are aroused. First, the threats were often loud, but always puny, and made serious only by judges so wedded to the status quo that critical analysis made them nervous.  Second, the test was so twisted and perverted in Dennis as to make the trial of those teachers of Marxism an all-out political trial which was part and parcel of the cold war that has eroded substantial parts of the First Amendment.
Action is often a method of expression, and within the protection of the First Amendment.
Suppose one tears up his own copy of the Constitution in eloquent protest to a decision of this Court.  May he be indicted? Page 395 U. S. 455
Suppose one rips his own Bible to shreds to celebrate his departure from one "faith" and his embrace of atheism.  May he be indicted?
Last Term, the Court held in United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 391 U. S. 382, that a registrant under Selective Service who burned his draft card in protest of the war in Vietnam could be prosecuted.  The First Amendment was tendered as a defense and rejected, the Court saying:
"The issuance of certificates indicating the registration and eligibility classification of individuals is a legitimate and substantial administrative aid in the functioning of this system.  And legislation to insure the continuing availability of issued certificates serves a legitimate and substantial purpose in the system's 391 U.S. at 391 U. S. 377-378.
But O'Brien was not prosecuted for not having his draft card available when asked for by a federal agent.  He was indicted, tried, and convicted for burning the card.  And this Court's affirmance of that conviction was not, with all respect, consistent with the First The act of praying often involves body posture and movement, as well as utterances.  It is nonetheless protected by the Free Exercise Clause. Picketing, as we have said on numerous occasions, is "free speech plus." See Bakery Drivers Local v. Wohl, 315 U. S. 769, 315 U. S. 775 (DOUGLAS, J., concurring); Giboney v. Empire Storage Co., 336 U. S. 490, 336 U. S. 501; Hughes v. Superior Court, 339 U. S. 460, 339 U. S. 465; Labor Board v. Fruit Packers, 377 U. S. 58, 377 U. S. 77 (BLACK, J., concurring), and id. at 377 U. S. 93 (HARLAN, J., dissenting); Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 559, 379 U. S. 578 (opinion of BLACK, J.); Food Employees v. Logan Plaza, 391 U. S. 308, 391 U. S. 326 (DOUGLAS, J., concurring).  That means that it can be regulated when it comes to the "plus" or "action" side of the protest.  It can be regulated as to Page 395 U. S. 456
the number of pickets and the place and hours (see Cox v. Louisiana, supra), because traffic and other community problems would otherwise suffer.
But none of these considerations is implicated in the symbolic protest of the Vietnam war in the burning of a draft card.
One's beliefs have long been thought to be sanctuaries which government could not invade. Barenblatt is one example of the ease with which that sanctuary can be violated.  The lines drawn by the Court between the criminal act of being an "active" Communist and the innocent act of being a nominal or inactive Communist mark the difference only between deep and abiding belief and casual or uncertain belief.  But I think that all matters of belief are beyond the reach of subpoenas or the probings of investigators.  That is why the invasions of privacy made by investigating committees were notoriously unconstitutional.  That is the deep-seated fault in the infamous loyalty security hearings which, since 1947, when President Truman launched them, have processed 20,000,000 men and women.  Those hearings were primarily concerned with one's thoughts, ideas, beliefs, and convictions.  They were the most blatant violations of the First Amendment we have ever known.
The line between what is permissible and not subject to control and what may be made impermissible and subject to regulation is the line between ideas and overt acts.
The example usually given by those who would punish speech is the case of one who falsely shouts fire in a crowded theatre.
This is, however, a classic case where speech is brigaded with action. See Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 357 U. S. 536-537 (DOUGLAS, J., concurring).  They are indeed inseparable, and a prosecution can be launched for the overt Page 395 U. S. 457
acts actually caused.  Apart from rare instances of that kind, speech is, I think, immune from prosecution.  Certainly there is no constitutional line between advocacy of abstract ideas, as in Yates, and advocacy of political action, as in Scales. The quality of advocacy turns on the depth of the conviction, and government has no power to invade that sanctuary of belief and conscience. [Footnote 2/3]

See McKay, The Preference For Freedom, 34 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 1182, 1203-1212 (1959).

See Feiner v. New York, 340 U. S. 315, where a speaker was arrested for arousing an audience when the only "clear and present danger" was that the hecklers in the audience would break up the meeting.

@_subject: "Blackphone" said to be "a super-secure nsa-proof" 
Fears over NSA spying have prompted people around the world to think about security differently, whether it be petitioning for companies to better secure their data or changing the information they share online. In particular, security around smartphones has been of great concern, as people increasingly surf the Web, make calls and send messages from their mobile devices.
An international group of privacy enthusiasts has come together to create Blackphone, a smartphone that claims it will help to better protect your information.
Mashable writes that Blackphone is the brainchild of Silent Circle and Geekosphere, with participation from big players in the fight for information privacy and computer security. Phil Zimmermann, creator of data encryption protocol PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), is one of the minds behind the “Blackphone provides users with everything they need to ensure privacy and control of their communications, along with all the other high-end smartphone features they have come to expect,” Zimmerman said, according to Mashable.
[ Right Click: Kiwi lifestyle tracker to free people from their smartphones ]
The operating system is a custom build of Android OS called PrivatOS, designed for improved security. Silent Circle’s CEO Mike Janke says the project will be open source, as will the PrivatOS operating system. The phone likely won’t have the most outstanding specs, but the team says that’s because privacy is the top concern.
No specific details have been given about the phone yet (although some of the code has been posted to GitHub). The companies say they’ll be unveiling it properly at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona beginning Feb. 24.
Even with very little information about the device currently available, some media outlets are suggesting that the phone could be “NSA-proof.” That’s a tall order, especially in light of a story from The New York Times claiming that the NSA has implanted software in nearly 100,000 computers to create backdoor radio access.

I recommend that you ask for "ideas", not "suggestions.  While I see no reason to believe that a "death prediction lottery" is illegal, any prosecutor salivating to victimize people would want to charge 'conspiracy', an extraordinarily broad charge.   A 'conspiracy' is an agreement by two or more people to commit a crime, and at least one action done in furtherance of that crime. Asking for 'suggestions'  implies an offer, and giving the 'suggestion' implies an agreement, and the implementation of that agreement could be called the completion of that conspiracy.  Asking for mere 'ideas', instead of 'suggestions', tends to isolate the source of those ideas from responsibility.  I wish somebody (one not associated with any DPL, 'AM', 'AP', etc) would file a lawsuit in federal court, challenging the government to prove that a 'death prediction lottery' or 'Assassination Market' is necessarily illegal.  That's because currently the Feds may be secretly planning to file charges against 'AM's Sanjuro or others, and it would be better to pre-challenge them, before they can act like heroes, sweep in, and arrest the 'evil criminals'.

Well, while the chosen name "Assassination Market" is intentionallyquite provocative, Sanjuro's 'AM' site includes some appropriate caveats (they will pay regardless of the nature of the death, including presumably:  Accidents, natural disasters, illnesses, suicide, etc) that ought to make it the overall system legal.   (At least, legal with the exception of some people out there who might commit murder.)

At the risk of inadvertently patting myself on the back (I probably mentioned something like this in my AP essay), that's a good tactic.  Keep in mind that most donors to DPL/'AM/AP would have no problem paying any perpetrators.  Further, such systems will presumably be carefully designed to prevent the identification of those bettors/donors, so even if there is a prosecution after a death, it will become very difficult or impossible to determine if the party charged is the same person who is to receive the payment.  Further, the wheels of justice grind slowly.  Any such payment should probably be made very quickly, certainly within a month and quite possibly within a week.  The organization making the payments will have made the payment long before anybody is convicted for a crime.  So, while I think it's a good idea to include such a clause, it would (happily) be of minimal effectiveness.
Yes, that is an additional factor.  Internet-betting has, in the past and perhaps currently, is objected to by the United States Federal government.  Defending a DPL/'AM'/AP system ought to be as easy as analogizing with life-insurance laws.
Sorry to contradict you, but I recall cases (up to the level of the US Supreme Court) allowing this.  How 'difficult' it is, I don't recall.  Problem is, I don't have access to the Lexis system that I used while stuck in the Fed's "gated communities".  But at least at the Federal level, such a mechanism exists.  I wish I could be more specific.   I'll check                 Jim Bell

Obviously, this is a well-meaning idea.  However, I wonder how 'efficient' such a tactic would be.  It might take years for a person to get into a position to be able to obtain and leak information.  And, the longer a 'mole' stays, the more he will become dependant on that government.  And, let's not fall into the trap of assuming that everyone who works for a government agrees with the policies and practices of that government.  If we guesstimate that 1% of (current) government employees would be sufficiently unhappy to do such leaks, the main thing that's necessary to do is to somehow add additional inducement:  To reward them for exposing that government.  If Snowden or Manning, or both, get a well-publicized $5 million reward, that would invigorate a lot of similar people to do similar things.  What's desirable would be a kind of anonymous reward system to allow ordinary people to reward the leakers.  I haven't read enough about the origins
 of Wikileaks to know whether such a system was ever contemplated.

One obvious problem with "money for leaks" is that, who decides what a given leak is worth?  So, fixed prices are probably out.  But, the actual leak can be posted, and the potential donors will decide what they will give.  As I recall, one problem with the Wikileaks system was that its ability to collect donations (through credit cards) was impeded.  Presumably, Zerocoin will shortly become available for truly anonymous donations. But, it occurs to me that even though the leaker should be able to collect the reward truly anonymously, perhaps it should be documentable the fact that he/she actually obtained that amount, for the encouragement of future, potential leakers.  Could the donations/rewards go through the leak-organization in a pseudonymous (at least) fashion, and then be given to the anonymous leaker, in a way that is documented sufficiently so that people considering becoming leakers are aware of the actual rewards being given?

Yes, I too haven't seen any ex post facto law; however, as I recall ex post facto prohibition only works on criminal cases, not civil.  I saw an indication of a criminal case where the limitations period was illegally extended.         I met two of these convicts while in prison, and I am absolutely convinced that they were falsely convicted.  Worst, they were charged about 10 years after the crime, when the statute of limitations was about 5 years.  There was no limitations period for crimes punishable by death, but the crime occurred during a time in which the Feds did not have a death penalty.  Thus, the appeals court simply and deliberately violated the law.       (However, on a skim I don't see reference to the statute of limitations issue here.)

Au contraire!  A good argument can be made that retroactive acquittal (more precisely, in this case, retroactive civil immunity of corporations) is a violation of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which says in relevant part:
  Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;_nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws_.
If people were supposed to be protected by the law in question, and once it was found out that the corporations were violating it (worse, doing that on behalf of the government!) then to give those corporations retroactive civil immunity amounts to denying the public that protection the law ostensibly was intended to provide.

However, Microsoft’s general counsel Brad Smith tells The Financial Times that “people should have the ability to know whether their data are being subjected to the laws and access of governments in some other country and should have the ability to make an informed choice of where their data resides.”
That Microsoft is willing to go this far shows how much the NSA spying scandal has damaged trust between American tech companies and their international customers. Microsoft even took the unusual step late last year of classifying the United States government as “advanced persistent threat” to its customers’ security, a designation that the company normally uses only cyber terrorists sponsored by foreign --------------------------quote ends-------------------------------------------------------

    Well, I suppose it's desirable that such big companies talk like they're fighting back against USG/NSA, but their final 'bite' had better be far more serious and definitive than their current 'bark'.              Jim Bell
