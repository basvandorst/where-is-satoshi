   [1]borkee writes "[2]Estonian [3]MEAC and [4]CMB [5]start testing a
   new version of a [6]national ID card containing what they call
   'contactless' extensions. Although they do not specifically disclose
   to us, taxpayers, what technology is used there, it must be quite
   obvious that it's nothing less than [7]RFID. Add to this, they'll have
   person's biometrics in memory. (Security gurus of course know:
   biometrics just don't work.) Soon you can track us poor Estonians by
   our GSM phones and by our ID cards too!"
