@_subject: Past one terabit/second on fiber 
especially when 1Tb fiber is in practice - our phone calls will take only nanoseconds! :)
anything included in that as to why they used a dfb laser for channel 16? or is it something obvious i'm missing? i notice they're still using the encyclopedia/second benchmark..
