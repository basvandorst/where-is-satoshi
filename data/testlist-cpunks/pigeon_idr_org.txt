@_subject: Consider "Working Assets" phone service instead of AT&T 
I used to sell Working Assets.  In answer to the question about
reselling of the lines, it works like this:
1.  All the phone companies lease some lines from other companies in
order to access all regions in order to provide equal access and
competitivesness.  This opened the door for small start up companies
to lease lines instead of setting up whole new systems.  There are
quite afew companies who do this.  Working Assets leases from Sprint.
They, unlike AT&T don't provide all the communication system contracts
for the govt. and military.
2.  In response to the person who said that WA's plan of calling on
specific issues wreaks of the same type of Big Brotherism as the
Everyone has a choice as to what they say to the people targetted.
Plus the phone call IS free.  Third if the privacy opponents and right
wingers and conservatives are wielding havoc on our system why
shouldn't we have access to the same methods to affect govt. policy as
they do.  WA has actually published # that while public are not listed
in any directories.  This is a useful tool.  Lets not waste the
resources we have.
