@_subject: A Reason for Privacy 
I had a talk today with our Office Manager which reveals an other
reason why we need anon. system.
That is to say a good reason we can hold up to the press, media and
other people..
The Example:
Job Ads..
This are often non on an Anon. basis. For example, the new york times
will function as an anon. forwarder of job resumes...
The office manager needs to have both the company name and the name of
the person getting the resumes to be kept anonymous...

@_subject: Lance Rose writes anti-cryptoanarchy in WIRED 
Lance Rose is a good guy... IMHO..
1) I use his legal services
2) I haven't read the article but it seems reasonable esp. if    we don't have NON-Escrowed encyptions...
   e.g., if clipper wins I think Lance is probally correct...
3) he can be reached at 72230.2044 at compuserve.com

@_subject: AT&T IVES chip 
This seems like good news..
e.g., cable systems are installing phone systems on the cable and
doing transactions via the cable (pay per view, home shopping, etc.)
A fear of mine was the Clipper was intended as the encryption standard
for all of this. Since AT&T appears to have a chip set that uses
RSA I consider this good...
Assuming it doesn't have escrow, etc.
Recall one of the major current vendors of cable converter boxes has
licensed clipper. (I forget which one).
