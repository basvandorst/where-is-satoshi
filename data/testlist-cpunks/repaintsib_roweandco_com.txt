@_subject: We're Short on Euphemism Today 
guess what i finally put in the shop
but the main thing i love about this picture is tree cover you can see in the upper right corner thats how it was all around the block even on really hot days you could find a great place to play in some serious shade everyone had a huge tree or trees somewhere on their property and bushes and ivy and a great variety of things the only reason we had those young trees on the corner was because my mom sold our big palm tree to some palm springs landscapers ha
breakfast i always have two eggs and salsa always i dont really get sick of it and it would really stink if i did because theres not a lot out there for breakfast actually when you are at your ideal weight and ovulating regularly you can have any kind of whole grain hot cereal without a problem you know steel cut oats etc i am not quite there yet berries and grapes are pretty low on the glycemic index and i have those too oh and i love cottage cheese with fruit
did anyone else sustain life with saltines from the ages of 13-17
me um we didnt have disney games when i was five
Taking the valentines happy girl
a conversation today
i went to the fabric store tonight in search of prints to make some new spring scarves with some will probably end up in the shop too i just love this look also i love toast (the catalog and the cooked bread)
cate and i went through some of the free options around the web for valentines to download and print the deal with pcos and carbs
what do you look for in a best friend
seriously though my closest friends are fun real and honest good entertaining in love with life a little crazy down to earth deep and incapable of bs
i thought id live there forever one day when i was 12 my dad quit his job and we moved to lake tahoe it rocked my stable world all the sudden im 30 i thought id be driving a mini van full of kids and happily decorating my own home but life has shown me again that i am not in control and as i wait for more children and a sense of being settled cate what did you play on the computer then
when cate is too scared to go downstairs penny will go with her and everything is all right she lets cate dress her up for weddings or try to ride her or pull her by the tail almost daily and even knowing the torture she will soon endure she gets so excited when cate gets home from school
from the spring/summer 09 toast catalog but the commonality between each experience was- it was out of my hands i occasionally fell in love with someone who couldnt be had i occasionally had to run from someone who wouldnt let me go
and then i found myself a mother funny i thought id teach awhile longer and have grant all to myself and save some money a little note for my valentine
