This has happened before; an Aegis ship in the Persian Gulf shot down
an Iranian Airlines (or whatever it's called) aircraft; i'm not sure
how many died in that incident (i think about 70 - can very well be

There's still the possibility that something malfunctioned (but not
fatal - otherwise - for the plane). I'm not
saying it's what happened, but it's a distant possibility.
