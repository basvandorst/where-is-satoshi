References: In the late 70s, I was at TRW we built inflatable (beach ball) antennas for a black project.  About 1/3 of the balloon's inside surface was aluminized and the feed was simply snapped into place at the opposite side.  The antenna could either be used hand-held or place in a ring mount on a flat surface.  This sort of approach could work well for cell phones and WiFi cards with external antenna port.  For cell phones the entire instrument could be placed in at the reflector's focus and operated via a mic/headset adapter (some older Nokia models have an external antenna port behind a small rubber plug on the rear.)

@_subject: How to Stop Telemarketers... 
Most Telemarketers use what is called Predictive Dialers, which are PCs with software that dials ever number in a phone exchange until it gets lucky. Now you can use their own technology against them, and it's legal...
Here is how their system works: the dialer calls your number, you answer, and you have probably notice the line appears dead after you said, "Hello". What their computer is doing is listening for a short burst of audio, your "HELLO", followed by a period of silence. With this heard, it will log your phone number as valid and transfer the call to an available telemarketer, the reason for the delay before someone comes on line.
Now, if their computer receives a long audio burst (an answering machine) " Hello, this is Alan Carlton", then it will disconnect, but it will log you phone number as valid, for a later call-back. Oh Lovely! Some are even capable of detecting Fax tones and will even transmit a fax trying to sell selling something you're probably are not interested in. However, do not answer, or when you do answer the phone, or if fax tones are detected, or if it detects an answering machine, in all four (4) cases IT LOGS YOUR NUMBER AS A GOOD PHONE NUMBER FOR FUTURE CALL- BACK --- PLUS THE COMPANY IS ALSO SELLING THESE VERIFIED VALID NUMBERS LIST TO OTHER TELEMARKETERS.
A SIMPLE WAY TO STAY OFF THE LIST IS TO USE THEIR OWN TECHNOLOGY AGAINST THEM.
The predictive dialer's software also looks for NON-valid phone numbers, and there is a simple way you can make your phone number appear invalid to the telemarketers' computers, thus they do not call back and accumulate no database, at least with your number, to sell other Telemarketers.
Here is how to do it: If you call a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service you will hear 3 short tones, "doo...dah...dee", thanks to Ma-Bell. Each time you Refresh this page you should hear, "doo...dah...dee". The actual frequency of these tones are 985.2 Hz, 1370.6 Hz, and 1776.7 Hz. Guess what the telemarketers' software does when it detects these 3 tones at the beginning of your outgoing message? It thinks it has reached a line that is disconnected or is no longer in service. So, it disconnects and does not log your phone number as a working number. BINGO!
NOW record these onto you outgoing message or voice mail announcement, and start exterminating telemarketers. Try this example, but use your own name, "doo...dah...dee, Hello, This is Tyler Durden". It must be at the beginning of your announcement to work. You may have to explain it to you friends, but they will soon have it on theirs' too.

Tarzan is a peer-to-peer anonymous IP network layer.
Many P2P systems try to implement anonymity at the application layer, instead of at a lower-level network layer. A robust free infrastructure which can anonymize any Internet traffic would benefit a wide array of existing protocols and current p2p systems, since the anonymous connection could seamlessly replace the current connection.
Main designs goals of Tarzan, ordered by priority:
7	Application independence: Tarzan should provide the abstraction of an IP tunnel and perform transparently to user applications.
7	Anonymity against malicious nodes: Tarzan should ensure that colluding nodes cannot link a participating host as the sender (or recipient) of any 7	Fault-tolerance and availability: Tarzan should resist an adversary's attempts to overload the system or to block system entry or exit points. Tarzan should minimize the damage any one adversary can cause by running a few compromised machines.
7	Performance: Tarzan should maximize the performance of tunnel transmission, subject to our anonymity requirements.
7	Anonymity against a global eavesdropper: An adversary observing the entire network should be unable to determine which Tarzan relay initiates a particular message.

WASHINGTON - When he signed the Homeland Security bill on Monday, President George W. Bush effectively drafted corporate America to serve in the war against terrorism--with Internet service providers among those on the front The new law makes it easier for AOL Time Warner, Comcast, Microsoft's MSN unit, United Online and the rest of the nation's 3,000 Internet service providers to volunteer subscriber information to government officials without worrying about customer lawsuits. Under the new law, they can release the contents of customers' communications to law enforcement without a court order and without fear of a suit if they have a "good-faith" belief that an emergency warrants it. Before, they had to have a "reasonable" belief--a higher legal standard--that release was warranted.

I believe it was Albert Einstein that suggested budding physicists not strive for professional careers but engage in full-time work in some other area (perhaps in a trade).  Treat science as an avocation, something that can be successfully pursued in one's spare time.  (He did some of his most important work while engaged as a patent examiner).
Today, there are still quite a few people engaged in amateur astronomy.  They toil night after night taking measurements and making observations. Many might think its all for naught, what could they possibly contribute to serious science now that there is Hubble and are so many large instruments managed by professional astronomers and staffs.  And they would be wrong.
In the past decade appropriate electronic image sensors have dramatically improved in performance and dropped in price.  Smaller amateur instruments, some not all that small, now have many of the capabilities that formerly were the province of the large professional variety prior to such sensors.  Also, the sky is vast and most of the professional instruments have very small fields of view.  Someone has to tell where to look.  Often its the professional astronomers pursuing some esoteric work, but increasingly its the thousands of astronomers and their keen eyes which first spot important amateurs.  The result, amateurs (who were not long ago looked upon by professionals as charming relics) are now receiving increased respect and increasingly partnering with professionals on important work (and being named as co-authors of published papers).
Of course these amateurs aren't paid, so why or how do they do it?  Many are retired and rather than touring in country their mobile homes or watching the grandchildren have embarked on a sort of second or third career.  Others take advantage of computers and the electronic sensors to run sky patrol cameras so the telescope does most all the work and they still have their full-time careers.
I see no reason why important security, crypto or financial crypto developments must be linked with direct or immediate financial compensation.

Implementation of Chosen-Ciphertext Attacks against PGP and GnuPG
K. Jallad, J. Katz, and B. Schneier
Information Security Conference 2002 Proceedings, Springer-Verlag, 2002, to ABSTRACT: We recently noted that PGP and other e-mail encryption protocols are, in theory, highly vulnerable to chosen-ciphertext attacks in which the recipient of the e-mail acts as an unwitting "decryption oracle." We argued further that such attacks are quite feasible and therefore represent a serious concern. Here, we investigate these claims in more detail by attempting to implement the suggested attacks. On one hand, we are able to successfully implement the described attacks against PGP and GnuPG (two widely-used software packages) in a number of different settings. On the other hand, we show that the attacks largely fail when data is compressed before encryption.
Interestingly,the attacks are unsuccessful for largely fortuitous reasons; resistance to these attacks does not seem due to any conscious effort made to prevent them. Based on our work, we discuss those instances in which chosen-ciphertext attacks do indeed represent an important threat and hence must be taken into account in order to maintain confidentiality. We also recommend changes in the OpenPGP standard to reduce the effectiveness of our attacks in these settings.

A recent news article described the nationwide strike in Venezuela, in protest against the nascent dictatorship of Hugo Chavez, as seeming "like something from fiction." Well, yes, it seems very similar to one work of fiction in particular: Ayn Rand's prophetic 1957 novel, "Atlas Shrugged."
The parallels between fiction and fact are striking. In Ayn Rand's novel, America is sliding into an economic dictatorship, so inventors and businessmen lead a secret walk-out, withdrawing their support from the "looters" who want to plunder the wealth they create. They declare that they won't return until the looters relinquish power.
Rand's working title for the novel was "The Strike." In an era of frequent, sometimes violent strikes by factory workers, it was shockingly original to suggest that the entrepreneurs, inventors and capitalists might go on strike.
Ayn Rand's imagined strike is no longer fiction. For four years, Venezuela has been gradually sliding into an economic and political dictatorship under Marxist populist Hugo Chavez, an open admirer of Fidel Castro and Saddam Hussein. In response, the nation's largest federation of businessmen has led the nation for more than 40 days in a massive work stoppage. Venezuela's most productive citizens have gone on strike to protest their imminent liquidation under Chavez's communist revolution.

Attorney General John Ashcroft is visiting an elementary school.
After the typical civics presentation to the class, he announces,
"All right boys and girls, you can ask me questions now."
A young boy named Bobby raises his hand and says, I have three
questions, Mr. Ashcroft:
1. How did Bush win the election with fewer votes than Gore?
2. Why are you using the USA Patriot Act to limit Americans civil
      liberties?
3. Why hasn't the U.S. caught Osama bin Laden?
Just then, the bell sounds and all the kids run out to the playground.
Fifteen minutes later the kids return to class, and Ashcroft says,

Indeed 'privacy' and 'secrecy' are often confused and their meanings overlap in many a mind.  I think that most, at least in the West, accept that privacy "..is based on rules and trust," for example, records kept on us by our doctors.  Because exposure of various aspects of our private lives can do lasting damage, privacy is only effective when controlled by the party seeking it, who may disclose it or not as they see fit and can only be guaranteed when those who would "sell you out" don't possess the possibly damaging information.  For that reason among others, I am really only interested in privacy mediated by personal secrecy and technologies I trust and/or control.

References: I attended Eric's July 1996 Defcon IV talk on what he called "Universal Piracy".  He anticipated many of the potential problems with "recursive auctions" and assumed that most successful content creators would get their money through guarantors, like those that provide movie production investors "completion bonds."  Creators would establish themselves by giving away content until they established a sufficient reputation that they could raise money prior to completion or even before commencement of a new work, product or product update.  These ideas are now widely credited to J. Kelsey and B. Schneier from their 1998, Third USENIX Workshop on Electronic Commerce Proceedings paper, "The Street Performer Protocol"  and later more widely publicized in a First Monday review article   Eric refined his ideas at a Cypherpunks meeting that fall (the first one I attended) in his Berkeley house.

Funny thing about the 14th, the representatives of the Southern States (who had previously been sworn in and seated for the session) didn't get to vote on it.  They were ejected and the doors barred (the Senate even barred a New Jersey rep. who held the deciding vote and was strongly opposed to the measure).  They then reported that the majority (of those in the room) approved the measure, which was sent on to the states for ratification.  A similar travesty played out in the counting of ratifying states and reporting out the results.  When challenged in the Supreme Court the robed ones punted, saying it was a "political matter for Congress to decide".  Thus spake Tyranny.
Most all current federal authority rests on the 14th and the unwarranted expansion of the Commerce Clause (Wilkert v. Filburn) after FDR and Congress threatened to pack the bench with additional justices in order to pass unconstitutional New Deal legislation.

I gave a presentation at a conference a few years back in which I raised the idea that since Intellectual Property (e.g., trademarks) isn't, its really a lease, that our society should consider setting limits on the market penetration (say 50%, which is already in excess of the what many economists call the "friction free" point wherein companies can continue to gain market share merely by dint of their already considerable presence) of single companies in markets whose size (the therefore probably importance) exceeds some minimum threshold of the GDP.  However, instead of enforcing these limits via the Department of Justice, they would become a civil matter and one's competitors can use the courts to strip a company of its sole lease on a trademark or patent applied to this market.
I guess then the many science (especially theoretical) and technology developments by "amateurs" over the past three were just a fluke?
An excellent treatise on this can be found in Leonard Peikoffs' "The Ominous Parallels," 1982.  The author dissects many of the parallels between the raise of Nazism and the then current situation in the U.S.  He lays much of the cause for its raise and our "ominous" future in a lack of development in individual thinking, especially philosophical, the kind that launched America.

Considering the latitude to which the Supreme Court has allowed Congress to interpret "limited time' I doubt they would mind.  Ask Larry Lessig :)
Good question.  Because of the difficulty, I was inclined to focus on only markets which make up a substantial fraction of the GDP.  These have been tracked, relatively well, by the Department of Commerce's Standard Industry Codes (SICs).  Microsoft falls under software publishing.  I would propose that, for purposes of aiding implementation of this IP regime, these codes be broken down into segments which exceed some minimum (say at least 10%) of the original SIC.
Not likely.  See above.
Trademarks are of primary importance.  Imagine what would happen if MS lost any control of the term Windows (indeed they might anyway) related to OS user interfaces.

The Whig Party's platform was called, by Clay, the American System.  Today we call it mercantilism.  The Whigs pushed their internal improvements agenda (building unneeded and/or grossly overpriced roads, bridges or canals supplied by political contributors) across all the states in the early 1800s.  Everywhere it was a disaster bankrupting several.  So much so that by 1850 all state constitutions banned internal improvement activities.  This was the downfall of the Whigs, but many of its leaders resurfaced in the Republican party whose first presidential candidate was "A Jobless Recovery is like a Breadless Sandwich."

@_subject: Taking aim at denial-of-service attacks 
May 13, 2003, 6:01 AM PT
BERKELEY, Calif.--Graduate students from Carnegie Mellon University on Monday proposed two methods aimed at greatly reducing the effects of Internet attacks.
In two papers presented at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy here, the graduate students suggested simple modifications to network software that could defeat denial-of-service attacks and that could be implemented in the current protocol used by the Internet. The symposium, sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, began Sunday and lasts through Wednesday.
The puzzle method
The second presentation, also by a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon, proposes that servers use "puzzles"--problems that take a certain amount of processing time to solve--as a means of taxing any computer that tries to communicate with the server. Such a technique, which has also been suggested as a way to defeat spammers who send unsolicited mass e-mail, would help defend against denial-of-service attacks that attempt to tie up a victim server's memory with hundreds or thousands of connections.
The plan from XiaoFeng Wang asserts that such small tasks would hardly be noticed by legitimate users, while attackers would have to expend far more effort to do any damage. While others have suggested similar methods, Wang added to his proposal an auction-like transaction to further allow legitimate traffic to win out over attacks.
"Our mechanism enables each client to 'bid' for resources by tuning the difficulty of the puzzles it solves and to adapt its bidding strategy in response to apparent attacks," Wang stated in the paper that outlined his Bellovin also liked this idea but again said that certain issues need to be "It will work up to a point," he said. "The problem is that spammers and denial-of-service attacks are not using their own machines. If they need 16 times as many computers, they can--most likely--easily get that many more."

The DVR-S201 is the world's first DVD-R drive to support the recently released 4.7GB media of DVD-R Book Ver 2.0 for Authoring. The DVR-S201 drive is designed for authoring DVD titles that utilize the full capacity of mass-produced DVD-ROM or DVD-Video media. A completed DVD-R disc is ideal to use a Press Cutting Master Disc. The DVR-S201 drive is also specially designed for authoring applications offering added convenience for creating DVD titles and content with increased efficiency.
The DVR-S201 drive is backward compatible, allowing continued use of conventional 3.95GB / Book Ver 1.0 DVD-R discs. This allows for maximum compatibility with existing players and drives.
Discs recorded using the DVR-S201 can be played on most DVD-ROM drives and DVD-Video players. The drive's ability to handle a 4.7GB DVD-R disc, which is equal in capacity to replicated DVD-ROM or DVD-Video discs, allows the entire content to be test prior to mass production. The drive is also useful for small-scale distribution of DVD content.
