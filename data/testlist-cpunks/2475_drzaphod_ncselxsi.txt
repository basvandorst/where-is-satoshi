     For a guy who claims to want to help us Cypherpunks in the way of
personal encryption, scare tactics seem a little out of place.  I'm sure
we'd all like to use legal encryption methods [maybe]... but we ARE
Cypherpunks.. giving us the responsibility to use what's best and defend our
rights for privacy.  Using a package that hasn't been updated in 5 years
[MailSafe], we have diminished to politically correct yippies.  I;m not sure
quite what to do.. but I saw Jim Bidzos on a magazine once.. and he looks
like a fed.
By playing the game we are becoming part of it.  TTFN.
