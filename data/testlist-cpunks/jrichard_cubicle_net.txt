How small of footprint?  50K (presuming you mean in currency) isn't really
a measurement of footprint size to me. :)  Would something along the lines
of a Java iButton  match your requirements?  It truly depends on what you need the device to be capable of...and I don't just mean the crypto implementation but is this a device to be self-powered?
How do you need to interface with it?  Etc.

There are already carriers doing SS7 over IP via gateways.  Over the public
Internet is not a stretch from a technical standpoint but, in practice, I'd find it hard to believe too many LECs or IXCs going this route.  Private
IP networks, yes already in production even.  The public IP network, nobody serious is doing it.  Wait, well, if you just mean VoIP there are VoIP companies that are attempting things like this by partnering with regional and local ISPs to place voice gateways.  If you're talking governmental moves, there are easier ways.  The SS7 network isn't exactly encrypted.. How does this improve eavesdropping?  SS7 is only signaling.  There is no
voice payload on the SS7 network.  SS7 simply passes signaling information
around.  Perhaps the knowledge of calling and called party since those
digits are passed via SS7 but the converstation is entirely distinct.

Don't worry -- electricity supply difficulties are a problem here in sunny-but-raining-today California too.   In fact, it's a *big* PITA at the
moment here.  Super big.
They are not completely different.  Sure, there are some unique ones but there is plenty of overlap. :)  Josh Richards [JTR38/JR539-ARIN]
