I think it all depends upon the free will of the authors of the codes
to determine under exactly what conditions other people may share their
intellectual properties without paying money. The one may impose
some non-monetary conditions in the hope of achieving some
non-monetary effects in exchange of the work that has been done, while
the other impose no conditions at all. There can be no norm in that. After all, it is their codes and the potential users of
the codes may also have different views on that without unanimity.

I suppose you misunderstood me. Did I say price? I expressed that the context is one for free of charge (without paying money).
