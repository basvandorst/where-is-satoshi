"It is a popular illness." --International Olympic Committee (IOC) medical chief Alexandre de Merode on the high numbers of top-class competitors taking steroid-based drugs for asthma at Olympics (six times greater than at last year's Sydney Games).

Shaquille O'Neal will miss the NBA All-Star game because of a sore foot.  The L.A. center says, "Hopefully I can come back soon.  I'm a big 18-wheeler and one of my wheels ain't working, which means I can't go. But I'm getting air in the tire."... ... How about fixing the drive train on the free throw HOLLYWOOD SPORTS
EXCLUSIVE: A report from our Sundance Film Festival Gala and Police Raid in Park City, Utah. A Happy Place Productions and your very own SportsHollywood teamed up to throw one of the most talked-about parties at the festival (and at the police department). You may have even read or heard about this one in the national press (can you say "Temporary Restraining Order?" That's how big it was). It was covered by everyone from Entertainment Weekly to CNN to Tiger Beat... and probably soon on Court TV... But here's what they didn't tell you....
During the New York Knicks' victory over the Heat in Miami, referee Joe Forte ejected singer / songwriter Jimmy Buffett from the stands for using profanity...

Clifford Robinson of the Phoenix Suns was arrested Monday on charges of driving under the influence and marijuana ... No comment from Robinson... just giggling...
John Daly had a 9 on his first hole Saturday in the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. Three holes into the day, he was already 10 over. Only four birdies on his last six holes enabled him to finish with a 79. "It was just weird," he said, shaking his head. "Ten over after three holes..." ... And .08 over later that afternoon...
Billing itself as tougher, dirtier and meaner than the NFL, The XFL is started its first season...
... It's so desperate for attention that it won't be long before the XFL employs murderers, rapists and drug addicts... wait -- the NFL already does that...
I think I've seen enough of Anna Kournikova... well, not really, but how about Jennifer Lopez's butt for a change?
THIS WEEK IN SPORTS HISTORY
In 2000, Dennis Rodman joined the Dallas Mavericks, paying him about $465,000 for the remainder of the season...
... Plus extra if he would cheerlead as a Maverick Girl, too...
George Foster became baseball's first "two million dollar man" today in 1982 when he signed a five year, ten million dollar free agent deal with the New York Mets...
... Ten mil - or as A-Rod calls it -'beer money'...
PENALTY BOX
"MARK CHMURA, YOU'VE JUST BEEN ACQUITTED OF ASSAULTING A TEENAGER! WHERE ARE YOU HEADED NOW?" One day after being acquitted of sexually assaulting a teen-ager, former Green Bay Packer tight end Mark "Chewy" Chmura broke down in tears as he apologized for his conduct and wished to resume his NFL career. Chmura said he would celebrate his acquittal by going to Disney World before attempting to resume his pro ... Great - head right to a place with a lot of teenage For the entire Offensive Line:
Joel Blankenship, head football coach at Detroit Murray-Wright High School, faces a police investigation into charges he used a twenty-six-inch long wooden paddle to strike players who got poor grades or broke other school rules.  One fifteen-year-old freshman claims he received ten blows with the paddle, and that Blankenship struck him so hard the paddle cracked...

With Kathryn to tackle you can understand why football is so popular in that area. See her at:
