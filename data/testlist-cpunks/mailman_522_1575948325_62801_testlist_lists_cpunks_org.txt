[1] "New encryption technology closes WLAN security loopholes"
Next Comm has launched new wireless LAN security technology called
Key Hopping. The technology aims to close security gaps in Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP). It uses the MD5 (message digest, version 5)
algorithm that allows for rapid changes in encryption keys used, some
as often as every three seconds, denying hackers the time they need
to piece together an encryption pattern.
