I remember hearing somewhere that a cell phone manufactuer had created an
"encryption" algorithm for their phones. It inverted the waveform or
something like that. Now, I ask of you, how hard is that to get break? Not
very. It will keep Beavis and Butthead from listening to cell phone calls,
but that's about all.
Like you said, a lot of arrests have been made by evesdropping on cell
phone calls. I wouldn't put it past the NSA to be running SIGINT on such
calls. If these were encrypted using a method similar to how ssh does
shell connections, the NSA would be screwed.
And, incidentally, I really wish ssh was more standard than it is. I'd
like to be able to hit my ISP and such with it. ;) (Most ISPs don't like
you running nohup'ed processes).
Of course. And that stops their neighbor. Yeah.
My father bought himself a scanner for his birthday last year. The first
night he had it I went over, and we sat on the front porch. We heard a
load of cordless phone calls, including one to which a "friend" of mine
was a party, which was quite interesting indeed. We also heard a great
number of cell phone calls.
The majority of the latter were sexual in nature. Christian Coalition,
you're failing miserably. ;)
I wish I had better voice recognition technology, like the NSA surely has.
I'd have the system scan for the voices of people I know and record them;
again, like the NSA does.

A woman on the radio ABC news this morning said,
"Congressman...BONER?...Bahner is reportidly..." My guess is that someone
spelt it incorrectly on her sheet. ;)
Seems like a good issue to site when trying to push remailers, eh? :)

@_subject: your mail 
So which of the 2000 members of this list are you addressing? Further, why
did you subscribe to the list if you didn't want to get the mail from it?

Are you intentionally trying to be a dumbass or is it, like, a gift?

Um, Paul? I hate to break it to you, but they're not moderating yet. If
they were, we wouldn't get as much slime as we do on the list. Personally, I wish they'd hurry up. I'm getting rather annoyed with the
spam, the "you're all homosexuals" postings, the posts by morons that
can't figure out Majordomo or their mailers, and so on and so forth. So I ask you this: If the moderation isn't yet implemented, then how has
it "gone down sharply since the start of the censorship [which hasn't been
done yet]?"  I just can't wait to see what kind of witty comment Dimitri will
have on the first and second paragraphs of my response.

A decision to which you have definately stuck.
Non sequitor.
Non sequitor.
Or you're not capable of providing one. I think you reached your wit's end
a long time past.

(For those too stupid to see it except when explicitly denoted)
Ah, very strong response indeed. I feel as if shot down in flames, and my
mind aches from the slice of your wit. Deliver us, oh Vulis, for we are in

Believe what you will.
You only prove the old saying that goes simply, "People are stupid."
Exactly why, aside from the obvious unwarranted and inaccurate assumption,
is left as an exercise to the reader. Think of it as an intelligence test.
