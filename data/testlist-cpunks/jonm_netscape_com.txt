@_subject: Does your software? 
I really tried to resist but....
1 request a minute!!!!  That's a whopping 1440 a day!  Try 20+ a second or
over a million a day which is the current rough load which most of our
servers on our site handle...(our peak day last week was 17 million hits).
I don't disagree that there is value in producing a trivial server which
can be guaranteed to have zero bugs (since it is so small).  It, however,
should be treated as an intellectual excercise.  Comparing it to a production-level
retail server is simply meaningless..they have different goals (as your last
post emphasized)...

@_subject: Netscape "random" number seed generator code available 
If you take a look at the code you will see that this (and a ton of
other things) are already being done...Jeff is only pointing out
an extra item which is of special interest to the people in this
group...we are no longer relying on any single item of data but
rather a very large set and constant re-seeding during idle loops...

@_subject: Netscape and privacy 
The Navigator doesn't make any special connections nor perform any data collection
on the client-side.  In fact, most of the engineers here would quit long before
we would provide information without consent.  That was the reason for removing
the mail address from the HTTP header years ago...it is very easy to track what
the Navigator sends out by simply setting up a proxy/firewall...
Netscape (the company) does attempt to track users through their contacts with
our homepage...Needless to say, this is a common practice.  We track hits, IP
addresses, and attempt to use cookies to determine unique users...We sell advertising
based on estimates of hits/etc...if you never hit our site, you are never counted...
even if you do hit our site, no information (other than IP address) is ever known...
