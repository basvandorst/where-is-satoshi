I've been reading through "Applied Cryptography," as every good boy
and girl should :) and one of the concepts struck out at me recently. The idea of the Chinese Lottery seemed to be rather far fetched in my
first few readings, but then I came across the discussion of the new
Emergency Broadcast System.
This may just be an unfair helping of paranoia, but the system seems
to be a  perfect distribution system for a Chinese Lottery-like
keychecking or cracking system. Even though the public can turn off the
broadcast, the signal will still be sent.  The chips may even be
government-regulated... available only from the government so no one can
tamper with the signal and use this system for their  own
information-disemination needs (*ahem* Political agendas *ahem*
re-election  ads).  They might even encrypt the signals, for a touch of
irony.  Anyone find fault in this?

@_subject: Slogan/procmail help 
Speaking of testing stuff....  After my last question about C'punks slogans, I've messed up some
stuff and  haven't storage of the list since, therefore I don't have
any of the replies.  If anyone would like to compile a list of what's
been said (if anything) and  mail to to me (to jsled at ctp.org), I'd be
eternally grateful.
Also, if anyone is fluent in procmail (I think there are a couple of
you  floating around), please mail me at jsled at ctp.org...
Thanks a bunch, sorry for the annoyance.

Thanks...  actually, that's exactly what I wanted, but forgot to put
it in...  and my last post about "Slogan help": disregard that
entirely... it's not  needed (either part).  But so far I've only gotten
one reply about the slogan  thing, so please give me help on that one,
