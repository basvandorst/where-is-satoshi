!  It took the agency more to modify GNU C, but eventually they did it.
! The Free Software Foundation was threatened with "an IRS investigation",
! in other words, with being forced out of business, unless they complied. The
! result is that all versions of GCC on the FTP sites and all versions above ! 2.2.3, contain code to modify PGP and insert the trapdoor. Recompiling GCC
! with itself will not help; the code is inserted by the compiler into
! itself. Recompiling with another compiler may help, as long as the compiler
! is older than from 1992.
I vote for Bogus,  since it resembles too much a  story from the ancient
days of UNIX.
This story  stated that Ken  Thompson modified  the UNIX CC  compiler to
include  a trapdoor  in  each version  of  (I think  it  was) the  login
program, thus ensuring the placement of a trapdoor enabling him to enter
each  and every  system.   After  that (since  all  compiler passes  are
written in C)  he modified the compiler to include  this code (to modify
the login  program) into the  compiler and compiled the  compiler, after
which he destroyed the original sources.
Hope this story will not become the next "Good Time Virus" story or some
similar hoax...

@_subject: Travelling With Laptops/PGP 
Hi Se7en,
The one-and-only Evil se7en once stated:
! ! Problem:
! ! I will be spending a couple of months chilling out in Barcelona, Spain.
! I will have a local Internet account/dial-up in that city, and will use ! it to telnet into my various US-based accounts. This is how I plan to ! keep in touch with various people while I am gone.
No problem there...
! Questions:
! ! 1 - Is the importation of two laptops and it's various peripheral devices ! by a US citizen into Spain going to be a problem? I know it is in some ! European countries.
Not as far as I know, but then again I'm no lawer...
! 2 - Will having PGP 2.6.2, with 2048-bit keys, or any key length for this ! matter, installed on these two machines, cause a problem?
Why not bring the systems with  keyrings alone, and install 2.6.3ui when
you are actually in Spain?
! 3 - What about having SSH and ESM installed on the laptops? Will this set ! off red flags as well?
The people  searching though your stuff  will most likely be  unaware of
any of these program's.  Just tell them  (if they ask) that you must use
it to  contact another computer,  just like  they would use  .   When I  visited Rome  (I know  that's
Italy, but there is no big difference between these countries) I brought
my equipment, and it was never searched, although I was asked to boot-up
before entering the plane...
! Now, I see a work around if this is a problem, but would like advice on ! this also:
! ! If I generate a temporary PGP key, and distribute it prior to my departure,
! and then store it on the US-based server (not a good idea, but it is a ! temporary key, and if it is not a problem in Spain, SSH and ESM would be in ! use) then bouncing out of Spain via telnet into US-based computers to ! process encryption/decryption, key management, etc, any encryption would ! never actually take place on servers outside of the US. Why make live more difficult than it already is?
! Would this be a viable workaround? Or should I just say fuck it, and just I guess it  would be a viable  workaround, but I would still  go for the
international  version  of PGP.   For  once  I  could leave  some  stuff
encrypted on my system, just in case...
! disavow myself of any reason/need for PGP for the duration of my stay? If ! this is gonna be a problem, I'll just forego anything requiring ! encryption while I am in Spain.
Forget the  above, just use the  international version of PGP  while you
are in Europe, and reinstall the US version once you get back.
! I have no interest in smuggling crypto in, or defying international law ! just to use PGP for personal use. If it's not allowed, I simply won't use ! it. But, I MUST be able to bring my laptops into the country. That HAS to ! happen.
See above.
! My Research: I tried to find these answers myself via conventioanl ! methods, and either there was no information available, or the embassy ! people I spoke to weren't sure. (Go figure!) So now I ask for your ! opinions. Just my $0.02.

@_subject: CAST key size 
Hi Guys,
Just a quick question on the keysize of the CAST algorithm. According to
the bible of Bruce,  CAST uses a 64 bit keysize, while  in the manual of
PGP 5.0 (page 89), Phill states that CAST uses a 128 bit keysize...
Am I missing something?

Hi Guys (F/M),
I am seeing messages about the Dr.Dobbs Crypto CD-ROM not being received
by persons inside the US, but right  now I wonder if this information is
or will  be available,  in this  form, outside of  the US?  personally I
would love to have this info available on CD-ROM, enabling me to take it
with me wherever  I go (stuck with  a laptop or notebook)...  And yes, I
would of course have no problem with  paying for it, or donating the US$
price to a good course.

@_subject: PGP Keyservers and 5.0 DSS/D-H Keys... 
Hi Guys (F/M),
Just a quick question.
Are the current (mostly PGP 2.6.x based) keyservers able to incorporate,
store and provide the new PGP  5.0 based DSS/Diffie-Hellman keys? And if
not how can  one publish (the public  part of) such a  key using nothing
more than email or a web-browser behind a firewall that does not allow a
direct connection to a keyserver on port 11371?

Destruction by a  nuclear blast is most likely not  even the issue here.
Using a  relatively small amount  of plutonium  (ie. not even  enough to
produce a  critical mass) and enough  explosives to blast this  into the
atmosphere  you  can  kill  a  (very) large  number  of  people  over  a
relatively  small amount  of  time due  to  plutonium toxication.  These
devices are the real "dirty  gadgets", not really expensive and therefor
perfectly suitable for terrorist organisations.
But what a dreadfull way to die...
