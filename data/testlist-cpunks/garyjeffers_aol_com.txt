My Fellow Cypherpunks,
   My defense against getting overwhelmed with Cypherpunks list mail is to use Guan Sin Ong 's excellent archieve:
    .
   I find this easy and I don't have to delete tons of mail.

My Fellow Cypherpunks,
THIRD EDITION!! Sorry, this corrects the 2nd edition and 1st which had bad links. AOL  is a bitch!
   My 1st post on this subject lost text. sorry. Here is the full text:
    I have found another alternative to our corrupt, fiat, debt issued, privately owned, fractionally reserved $US.  - Silver Banks.
Here is the idea. The silver bank only accepts the walking silver dollar coin. It treats each coin as 1 US dollar as it nominally is.
However, each coin is worth many times that in $US money. Bank members are encouraged to deal with each other by
writing checks on the silver bank. Also, members are encouraged to give deep discounts to other members for purchases.
There are tax advantages to using the silver bank. Also, the transactions and store of value are inflation proof. Also, VERY IMPORTANT,  use of the bank will encourage "velocity of transactions" (business) among the members and, thusly, keep
the members prosperous.    Well, Cypherpunks, is this a good plan or not? Any ideas for making it The link below is where I got the info from:

OPPOSE THE WAR! We are going to ruin Iraq to get the oil. Who's next?
My fellow Cypherpunks,
   The purpose of the coming Iraq war is to steal their oil. After we get Iraq oil, which arab country
is next? If U. State can get away with the theft of Iraq, then why not just keep on stealing?
 The beneficiaries of this war are:
1. United State: This has a double benefit. A. The U.S. (as a (w)hole) is bankrupt on paper and our economy is going to hell. Stealing the Arabian oil fields will stave off a U.S. collapse for at least several years. B. The U.S. State (im)proper. In various ways, U State will get more powerful and richer from this.
2. Corporations, connected. They will benefit both from war expenditures and from associating
with the oil.
3. The ruling elite families. They will get even richer from the oil money funneled from the chosen
corporations. Also, as the State gets power, they get power.
4. The Zionists. Israel will probably get more land and oil fields unless the treacherous Bush family betrays them.  The Israeli Jews will probably just suffer. The ruling Elites really don't care about their sponsors :-(  Well, at least the Jews will get a symbolic victory :-)
