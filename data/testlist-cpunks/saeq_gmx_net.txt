         If anybody would, these guys will. I wub em. They have very sane views on free speech issues, and they've written positive stuff about encryption before. I'm pretty sure I remember them recommending PGP.

I think Karsten first asked that question. Well:
 "In a high-security wing of Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center, an unknown number of men with Middle Eastern names are being held in solitary confinement on the ninth floor, locked in 8- by 10-foot cells with little more than cots, thin blankets and, if they request it, copies of the Koran. Every two hours, guards roust them to conduct a head count. They have no contact with each other or their families and limited access to their lawyers. Their names appear on no federal jail log available to the public. No records can be found in any court docket in New York showing why they are detained, who represents them or the status of their cases."
         The ghost of Due Process hovers above the funeral pyre where her entire sisterhood burned, drifting between the wafting billows of rancid smoke, and I ask myself: What is to be done?

Do you seriously think that justifies suspension of due process? If you don't, why did you bring it up? That aside, I think it's been sufficiently demonstrated that you shouldn't treat people like collateral damage unless you wish to receive similar consideration...
         Did any governments that derive their being from the consent of the governed renege on promises to the 6000 in the WTC that they would have due process? Didn't think so. Work on one of the problems at hand, or shut the fuck up and crawl back under your rock, but either way, kindly refrain from further invoking emotion-laden irrelevancies. They get invoked more then often enough.

         You won't hear any disagreement from me, man. I was wondering if Anonymous was actually attempting to justify suspension of due process.
         Incedentally, I wonder if the USA Bill will get overturned by the Supreme Court anytime soon... Naaaa... Gr.

         Without people using black bloc tactics, activists would have received no press coverage... Not to mention the benefit to be gained by having a radical faction around to make your moderates look more, well, moderate - a technique as old as the American Revolution, and quite effective for Ghadi and King.
         But no - for many CACL types, those using black bloc tactics were just bored, upper-middle-class, college-age, uninformed dumbshits pointlessly throwing rocks through starbucks windows - an image similar in accuracy to that of the bored, upper-middle-class, insularly utopian randroid masturbating to "Guns & Ammo".
         I'm constantly amazed by the misplaced animosity many CACL types display towards the left-anarchist crowd. I think Bruce Sterling said (in Holy Fire) "Fanatics always hate and fear their own dissidents far more then they loathe the bourgeoisie. By this ye shall know them."
         I wince at fanaticism, whatever its source, but I wince most at the shortsightedness of CACL types who, in their self-righteousness, scorn those who could easily be their closest allies. From everything I've seen (and I've seen a lot), they agree on decentralization [1], agree on encryption, agree on "victimless crimes", agree on weapons possession [2], agree on intellectual property, and agree on individual private property [3].
         Who said it was? Have you seen anybody protesting against the opportunity that world markets can bring to poor people the world over? Or have you seen lots of people protesting secrecy-cloaked treaties designed to entrench government-supported monopolies?
         Make no mistake - that's what the WTO, the FTAA, and their ilk are all about. They are not about free markets; not about competition at all - they are about increasing the scope in which current multinational monopolies and duopolies (which, for the most part, would not exist without constant government support) can sell things. That is not the free-market way.
         For once and for all: Laissez-faire capitalism does not imply the existence of corporate entities! The left anarchists I know want to keep the means of production and distribution privately (or cooperatively) owned, and keep the free market of goods, services, and ideas... But they want to drop the notion of state-sanctioned corporate entities with their own rights, privileges, and liabilities distinct from those of their members.
         What's so bad about that?

         Perhaps people should pay better attention to the actions their government takes in their name - after all, you never know when somebody might take seriously all that talk about the actions of the government merely reflecting the will of the people, and in so doing hold your blissfully ignorant ass accountable.
