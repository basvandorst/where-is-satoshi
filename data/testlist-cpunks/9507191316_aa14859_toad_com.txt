This class of code is fairly old. In 'The Codebreakers' an incident is recounted (I think from WW2). A suspected spy in the US was sent
a cable from overseas, reading 'Our father is dead'. This was intercepted, and the censors, suspecting a stego'd message, substituted 'Our father is deceased'.
The suspected spy immediatly sent back 'Is father dead or deceased?', and was arrested. The book contains many fascinating stories of stego and attempted stego, including mailed knitting patterns, crossword puzzles, drawings, sports statistics, etc.
On the eve of Pearl Harbour, the wife of a Japanese diplomat in Oahu
sent a long message to Japan describing in detail the many kinds of
flowers blooming at that time in Hawaii. It was sent through non-diplomatic channels, and authorities suspecting it contained stego, failed to deliver it. After the war it came out that she did
regular gardening columns for a Japanese magazine, and the message was entirely innocent.
