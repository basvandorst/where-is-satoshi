I'd be careful with PGP - since the source code is freely available, it'd be
simplicity itself to insert one or two lines of C code to snarf away a copy
of your cleartext before encryption.  Somewhere where ye olde sysadmin could
peruse it at his/her leisure...
The only way to be sure is to get PGP off the net (from an ftp site out of
the control of your admin folks) and build it yourself.
