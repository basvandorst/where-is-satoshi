Dear Client/Subscriber,
Now that our new site has been released, we wanted to make you aware of
two new items available to you:
1.)     The Fall Futures Outlook.  A comprehensive 100+ page report,
covering many aspects of all major markets including fundamental and
technical analysis, both short term and long term, from stocks,
interest rates, currencies ... to grains, softs, meats ... etc.
2.)     Live broadcast direct from analysts on the floor of the
exchanges.  The flash broadcast after last Thursday's important USDA Crop Production report gave us an immediate interpretation of the numbers.   Check out the Initial Snapshot Report and the six page follow-up under "Research" on our website. Here's a link for your convenience.
Look for additional new releases and upgrades over the next several
As always, we appreciate your business and continued support.
Thank You,
Lannie Cohen, President
Capitol Commodity Services, Inc.
