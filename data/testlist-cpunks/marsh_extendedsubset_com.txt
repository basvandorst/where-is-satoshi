You don't know that.
For all we know, Randall Webmail is someone who posted something
derogatory about the King or El Presidente and when the Honor Police get
on his Facebook they're going to round up all his friends along with him.
Or he's sitting comfortably in his quite suburban home and he happens to
have one of the estimated 1M home routers that are pwned or 1M PCs with
the dnschanger trojan and his banking session is being redirected to a  hostile server.
This is not good advice.
All legitimate secure sites have a valid certificate, or the site is  horribly broken.
If you ask for a secure site, and are presented with a certificate that  was not issued to the legitimate site, it *is* a man-in-the-middle attack, by definition.
Just because you're staying in a hotel does not mean that you must allow  that hotel to intercept your secure communications. Furthermore, you  probably have know way of knowing that it even is the hotel that's  intercepting you. Hotel networks are not known for themselves being  secure, and authentication systems tend not to degrade gracefully.

@_subject: [cryptography] bitcoin scalability to high transaction rates 
I once spoke with some engineers who built and run one of those high-speed electronic trading networks/exchanges. Their time to match trades was something like 50 microseconds. Their serious members colocated their trading systems in their datacenter because it was so critical to eliminate the propagation delay.
I guess I don't see the need to do bitcoin crypto transactions at that  speed any more than the other high-speed exchanges need to rapidly move  stock certificates, hard cash, or perform ACH/EFTs.
Maybe you could be the next Certicom!   ^_^
But the term "high speed electronic exchange" seems to mean exactly this, almost by definition.

@_subject: [cryptography] Current state of brute-forcing random keys? 
The article is behind a paywall, but Google quotes the relevant statistic:
"The standard-cell implementation on a 0.35 B5m CMOS process from Philips  Semiconductors occupies an area of only 0.25 mm"
Let's assume:
* the attacker has only one file for which he wishes to find the key
* you generate the key using a method for which the attacker can do no  better than brute force for the nominal key size.
* the attacker can do no better than brute force against AES
* the attacker has ASICs using an AES implementation similar in chip area to Philips' standard cell
* the attacker can run his chips at a rate of 1 GHz
The last two assumptions are probably wrong. The Philips standard cell may not be optimized rapid re-keying and one that is might be larger in area. But the estimate of 1 GHz is probably conservative and there's an inherent output rate vs. area tradeoff in the pipelining of the design. But I think these assumptions are probably within a factor of 10x, i.e., a few bits of key size.
So we're close to a nice round figure... 2^32 trials per mm2-second. Now  you just have to find out how many mm2 of silicon the attacker is going to commit to decrypting your file! But obviously that's not the real metric, in large systems power and cooling is the limiting factor. How big of an air conditioner will he use?
Looking up a random modern Intel chip (Core i5-650 4M Cache, 3.20 GHz), it has a die size of 81 mm2 and a max TDP of 73 W. A recent Nvidia chip (GTX 480) is 529 mm2 and said to be 250W TDP. The bruteforce algorithm need not spend any time at all waiting for data, so it seems like it could easily be pushing the limits of power density. 1 W per mm2 seems like a reasonable guess, but unless the data center will be built underwater you could probably double it to account for the cost of heat removal.
Which neatly fits 2^32 trials per watt-second. A real engineer would  probably design the chips to minimize energy-per-trial, but I think our  estimate is probably still within an order of magnitude or two.
Last I checked, in the US electric power is around $0.07 per kWh in areas considered "cheap". So each trial costs $4.53eb18 in electric power.
For an 64-bit key, you expect the adversary to need 2^63 trials for which he might pay a power bill of $597.
For an 80-bit key, you expect the adversary to need 2^79 trials for which he might pay a power bill of $2.7M.
For a 128-bit key, you expect the adversary to need 2^127 trials for which he might pay a power bill of $11.0e21.
Note that some botnet operators control millions of nodes and they do not usually pay their own power bills. But they probably don't have the  efficiency of our specialized ASIC attacker either.
As others have said, you need a real key derivation function (like PBKDF2) with a at least a little added work factor for this. If the password is going to be human-chosen or human-remembered it's not likely to have even this much entropy in practice.

And they seem to be significantly less efficient in hardware than SHA-2.
Gee, it's almost as if the NSA knows a thing or two about designing and  implementing hash functions! :-)
Honest question: why should we think they can do it?
Everyone was invited to take part in the SHA-3 competition, and many  international teams did. In fact, most of the finalists aren't US teams.
Of all the hundreds of entrants there are 5 left. It seems that most were weeded out because they were less-that-maximally efficient or had attacks on their security.
Beating SHA-2-256 or SHA-2-512/256 is turning out to be harder than anyone No one spends more money on info systems than the US Government. Vendors  can implement whatever they want in the own (or extensible) protocols, but if USG requires SHA-3, it's going to be implemented in gear designed for sale in N. America.
Still, China is an increasing market too and their rulers are not afraid  of "intelligent design". We have them to thank for killing off proprietary incompatible cellphone chargers. They simply mandated that all mobiles charge via mini-USB.
We may be seeing signs of a fork in data security protocols too.
Alternatively, NIST could say "we've learned so much about hash functions over the past few years that we're going to allow designers another round of submissions."

An update:
Moxie Marlinspike and David Hulton have improved the attack from 2^57 to  Two days ago at Defcon 20 they released open source software for parsing  network captures for any MS-CHAPv2 handshakes and an online service using a Pico Computing FPGA cluster to reverse the NT hash. This allows decrypting a captured PPTP session or logging in as the user in about half a day on On Monday, Jacob Applebaum and I will be presenting our "vpwns: Virtual  Pwned Networks" paper at Usenix FOCI '12. It discusses the limitations of off-the-shelf VPN systems when used for user anonymity and censorship  resistance. PPTP is a common choice for these systems, so we'll take the  opportunity to reiterate the inherent weakness in MS-CHAPv2.
This is a good opportunity for everyone to make a contribution to  practical crypto. Anyone that can pitch in, let's do a full-court press on lobbying for the wholesale replacement for MS-CHAPv2 and to raise  awareness of the decryptability of PPTP. We could use blog posts, press  articles, tweets, etc.
Let's make this the week that the whole industry realizes that vendors  shipping these protocols are continuing to sell crummy sub-standard  single-DES crypto products which don't conform to modern security  - Marsh

In other words, they've accumulated a backlog of ciphertext. Encryption
working as designed.
This sounds like budget boondoggle baloney to me.
How can you be "on the verge" of something like that?
You might have some ideas on how to attack it, but until they're proven
they're just guesses and likely to be dead ends. Not something you
should justify reworking your computing systems around.
But once they're proven, you're not "on the verge".
Or it could just be all the 40- and 56- bit stuff that was captured by
wiretapping Americans and not decrypted way back when the NSA felt
constrained by laws.
Or it could be everything using 512-bit RSA key exchange.
Or it could be everything for which the security of the encryption
ultimately depends on a user-chosen password. E.g., MS-PPTP/MPPE (but
there's nothing really new about this).
Or it could be a common protocol using a cipher weakly. For example, I
noticed this the other day about RDP "standard, non-FIPS" mode:
If the endpoints do actually manage to negotiate the use of 128 bit (as
opposed to 40 or 56 bit) security, it uses the output of RC4 without
discarding any initial bytes. Those initial bytes have some
correlations, some of which can expose the whole key. Just to make sure
the 1684 bit state size of RC4 doesn't get stale, the protocol refreshes
the key every 4096 packets. (Actually better than MPPE which seems to
rekey every 1 or 256 packets depending on negotiated options).
Or it could be complete BS.

* Some of the largest supercomputers in the world are botnets or are held by strategic competitor countries. This precludes the old key shortening * The Sony PS3 and HDMI cases show just how hard it can be to keep a  master key secure sometimes. Master keys could be quite well protected,  but from a policy perspective it's still a gamble that something won't go wrong which compromises everyone's real security (cause a public scandal, expose industrial secrets, etc.).
* Am I correct in thinking that computing additional trapdoor functions to enable USG/TLA/LEA decryption is not free? Mobile devices are becoming the primary computing devices for many. People may be willing to pay XX% in taxes, but nobody wants to pay a decrease in performance and battery life to enable such a misfeature.

Right. The legitimate Windows Update system application won't recognize  certs from random CAs like DigiNotar. (Code signing PKI appears good  enough for everyone except the vendors themselves.)
But it might be possible to silently pwn MSIE users who checked the box  "Always trust ActiveX controls from microsoft.com" and the sky's the limit on how you might use something like that for social engineering.
Anyone can sign up to get a code signing cert for basic driver signing,  there is no test of purity of heart involved. Probably the only reason the bad guys used a stolen one is that it was easier to steal or buy a private key than to set up a temporary identity and pay a few hundred bucks for an official one.
