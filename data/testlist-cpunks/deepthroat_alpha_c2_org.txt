this new thing, a way of getting news events.  The 'old media' even
reported on it; how could it not, it was being pre-empted.  IRC beat
CNN five years ago during the US-Iraq war.  Bill Clinton's campaign
took his message (a little) to the net, a little to MTV.  But where
does that leave the big guys?  ABC, NBC, CBS??  Can they survive in
this brave new world which the net threatens to be?
not.  They are gargantuan dinosaurs, threatened by, well, hell,
you've heard the metaphors.  So had the dinosaurs.  And, as you should
have expected, they reacted, the main way they knew how.  They bought
themselves a law.  This is the way broadcasters have always worked.
When there was competition, they created the F.C.C. to tell them what
to say and not say.  When cable came along, and threatened to destroy
them, they got cable regulated.  It was interstate commerce after all.
Not that space in the ground is a scarce resource, but the
broadcasters are a powerful group.  They create and maintain
campaigns, name recognition, politicians.

Nixon looked next to Kennedy.  But now, they understand the game, and
they play it.
Media is inherently conservative, and with good reason.  They make
lots of money the way things are.  They don't want that to change.
And they weren't going to let it.

You need allies.  You need a cover story.  A Gulf of Tonkin incident.
You need to protect the children.  And who more manipulable today than

media is running scared.  They're not going to present this as a big
government issue, or a matter of censorship.  They're not even going

Even if the Chinese make this work for a few years and the
US does the same, it doesn't matter in the long run.  People can run
short lived remailers out of accounts that don't belong to them.  They
can buy service over an encrypted link from a seller outside of China.
They can use steganography.
Given this, how can a Chinese or other represive government crack
down?  They can't turn off all the computers.  They can try to allow
access to only 'aproved' sites.  They can arrest people.  But will the
war on encryption be as easily won as the war on drugs?  Drugs are
physical things; they emit odors, require bulky transport, guards,
etc.  Binary code doesn't emit a smell.  You can't train a dog to find
PGP.  Yes they can crack down, but all that will do is make the
information economy move underground and offshore.
In time, those states that declare war on encryption will become
police states.  Police states can kill a lot of people, but they tend
not to last more than a few generations.
