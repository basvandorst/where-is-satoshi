Other choices?
   Identity Theft
   Identity Pollution
   Identity Vandalism
   Identity Assault
   Identity Misappropriation
   (Slander in the First Person :)
Would it matter if we substitute "reputation" for "identity".  Is my identity
(to others) any different than the reputation with which it is associated?
Call it what you will.  If institutions that once recognized me fail now
to do so, I have lost something-in-general.
Name that something-in-general.

This is a curious viewpoint.  If someone makes off with my car, according to
the DMV the car is still owned by me.  Thus, it has not been stolen, I am barred from using it while the other person has access to it.  (And if it has
a hidden tracking device, it has not even been "lost".)
I appreciate your comments, but I still feel that "impersonation" is too a term, and lacks important implications of the term "identity theft".
It is one crime to impersonate an officer.  The crime is not one that some finds their personal identity subverted or nullified.  The term is often used when
an "impersonal role" is assumed.  In some venues, impersonation can be If I use a sledgehammer to smash a car's windshield, or someone's forehead,
I am not charged in both cases with "sledgehammering".  The name of the crime
reflects the result more generally than the means employed, in this case either
"destruction of private property" or "homicide".
Granted that "theft" is most often associated with the physical removal of
property.  But the import of the term is both that (1) the legitimate owner
finds they no longer have the use of the item, and (2) the "thief" profits
by the misappropriation, as if they were the owner-possessor.
It may not be a complete match, but "identity theft" is well characterized
by points (1) and (2) above.  That the "theft" is accomplished through the
mechanism of impersonation seems at most a related issue.
You might well point out that, unlike an ordinary theft, what was "taken" here
cannot be simply returned.  If, instead of impersonation, I were to access and
modify records and accounts in your name, add police records, medical problems,
and credit anomalies, what term would be appropriate for the crime?  I consider
perhaps "character assassination" to come rather close.  Unlike a "theft", the
perpetrator is not "assuming" the role corresponding to the now-polluted data.
(Note:  "Impersonation" also conveys no direct sense that, once the is halted, the significant damage remains.  But this is true of "identity as well.  "Identity assault" captures this, but not the misappropriated use.)
Sound-bites (memes) will only persist if they have utility.  Time will tell.

Thanks :)
There is "my sense of my identity", which works for me in many ways.  Short of
amnesia or devious brainwashing, that identity cannot be lost, stolen, or even
diminished or tarnished in any way without "my consent".
There is "other's sense of my identity" which works also for me in important
ways. It gets me recognized, allows me access, etc.  When I am maliciously
impersonated (impersonation itself not a crime I think) then the quantity we
call "other's sense of my identity" has been polluted, vandalized, and in the
most plain of terms, I have lost the facility of that identity needed in my
relationship to others.  And someone else has gained from its use.
Technically, one can argue that this is not "theft" of one's identity.
(Would you grant it is "misappropriation of one's identifying attributes"?)
But "impersonation", while very accurate, describes a method more than it
does the crime itself, much as "discharging a firearm" is accurate, but
says nothing about the intent, the target, or the damages.
The term "impersonation" can apply to a role, as in impersonating a
police officer or a doctor.  In such (ironically "impersonal") cases,
no individual police officer's or doctor's identity (or character or
reputation) is in any way involved.
This being the case, how to distinguish (give a name) to the crime that
DOES involve usurping the identifying attributes of a individual person,
to the diminishment of their character or reputation?
Even "identity impersonation", while more specific, does not carry the
connotations of criminality.  (If I am invited to the wedding of a distant
obnoxious relative, and pay a friend of mine to impersonate me at that
wedding, I may be guilty of poor ethics, but I don't believe I have
violated any criminal statute.)
So we come down to "unauthorized malicious identity impersonation".
Doesn't quite roll off the tongue ...

No problem.  I often employ a quoted "x" to convey "so-called x", a shortcut that
can lead to misunderstandings.
I'll wager the taxpayer/consumer will foot the bill, one way or another.
Derivative to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, it is easier to destroy wealth
than it is to create it.  So, on average, work/energy is required to create
or recreate wealth.  The collapse of a future global PKI, or of the integrity
of banking transactions, would represent a huge shift from order into chaos,
a decoherence of identities and orderliness amounting to a huge destruction
of wealth.  Recovery thus will require the recreation of wealth, in one form
or another.  This will require a correspondingly huge input of work.  So, who
does most of the work, in general?  You know the answer ;)
