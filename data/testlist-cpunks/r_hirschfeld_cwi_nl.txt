@_subject: The Crisis with Remailers 
Despite the ugliness of floating point arithmetic (lack of
associativity, for example) and my general distaste for it, I would
have to agree that 64-bit floats are higher precision than 32-bit
fixed-points, since more than half the bits are mantissa.
Do major currency traders really store money as 64-bit floats?  It
surprises me.
By the way, I thought the "get real" pun was funny and not at all
disparaging.  But I hope that "get rational" is good enough for
currency exchange.

@_subject: The Crisis with Remailers 
I completely agree.  But are the usual fixed-point representations
adequate for exchange rates, where it's not a matter of "down to the
cent" but of ratios of cents and centimes?  Is an exact representation
of rationals (e.g., pairs of integers) needed?

Send a cover letter and 12 copies of an extended abstract to be
received by November 17, 1997 (or postmarked by November 7, 1997 and
sent via airmail) to the Program Chair at the address given below.
The extended abstract (a short draft of the full paper, typically 10

authors no later than January 12, 1998.
Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will
be presented at the conference.
Proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer Verlag in
their Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  Preproceedings
will be available at the conference, but final versions will not be
due until afterwards, giving authors the opportunity to revise their
papers based on presentations and discussions at the meeting.
Instructions and deadlines for submission of final papers will be sent
later to authors of accepted papers.
Rump Session:
In addition to the regular conference program, a rump session will be
held to provide an opportunity for less formal presentations.
Although the rump session will be organized during the conference
itself, any advance proposals may be sent to the Program Co-Chair at
the email address given below.  Rump session contributions will not
appear in the conference proceedings.
A very limited number of stipends may be available to those unable to
obtain funding to attend the conference.  Students whose papers are
accepted and who will present the paper themselves are encouraged to
apply if such assistance is needed.  Requests for stipends should be
addressed to one of the General Chairs.
Information about conference registration and on travel, hotels, and
Anguilla itself will follow in a separate general announcement.  There
are special reduced registration rates for full-time academics and
students.  Further information about registration is available online
via the URL listed below.
A workshop, intended for anyone with commercial software development
experience who wants hands-on familiarity with the issues and

Special Attraction:
On Thursday, February 26, 1998, there will be a total eclipse of the
sun.  The narrow zone of 100% totality will pass just south of
Anguilla, and there should be an excellent view of the eclipse from
the conference site.

need to buy an Anguilla drivers license, but this is a formality.
Taxis are also available.  Another possibility is to hitch rides from
local residents, who are eager to provide them and will often stop to
offer rides unsolicited.  Transportation will be provided at specific
times between Mariners and the InterIsland hotel.
Expect temperatures in the 20's or 30's Celsius, 70's or 80's
Fahrenheit.  There is often a strong wind, with cloudbursts that
quickly blow over.  Dress code for the conference is shorts and
The local currency is the Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$), with an
exchange rate of approximately EC$2.7/US$1, but many goods and
services in Anguilla, particularly those aimed primarily at tourists
(such as restaurants and hotels) are priced in US dollars.  US dollars
are freely tradable everywhere on the island, so there is no need to
obtain EC dollars before arrival.

A 40-hour workshop, intended for anyone with commercial software
development experience who wants hands-on familiarity with the issues
and technology of financial cryptography, is planned in conjunction

For more information on the workshop, please see the URL
For workshop registration, see the URL Special Attraction:
On Thursday, February 26, 1998, there will be a total eclipse of the
sun.  The narrow zone of 100% totality will pass just south of
Anguilla.  A boat excursion to the center of the eclipse zone is
planned, for an optimal view of the eclipse.  The excursion is
included in the conference registration; additional tickets can be
purchased for accompanying persons.
The Inter-Island Hotel is a small 14-room guest house with a large,
comfortable 150-seat conference facility and additional space for a
small 10-booth exhibition.  The Inter-Island is on Road Bay, near
Sandy Ground Village, in the South Hill section of Anguilla.  The
conference, workshop, and exhibition will have TCP/IP internet access.
Shuttle service to the conference will be available.

Air travel to Anguilla is typically done through San Juan for US
flights, or St. Maarten/Martin for flights from Europe and the US.
There are also connections via Antigua.
Anguillan import duties are not imposed on hardware or software which
will leave the island again. There are no other taxes--or cryptography
import/export restrictions--on Anguilla.
