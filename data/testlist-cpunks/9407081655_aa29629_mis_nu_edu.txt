@_subject: Request: tamper-proofing executables 
There are lots of ways to detect modification of executable code, and possibly take some action based on the outcome.  The hard part comes when you consider that the code doing the checking may itself be hacked.  A determined hacker would just patch the code to jump around the test.  I suggest three things to make it harder:`
1.  Make more than one test in more than one place in the code, making it harder to find all of them.
2.  If you use any embeded keys, create them at run time from pieces stored in different places in the code and/or data.
3.  Store the code in compressed format.  One nice way to do this is with PKLite Professional with the -e option.
The choice of algorithms used to sign the files (i. e. DSA vs RSA vs salted hash vs simple CRC) is probably less important than the details mentioned above.  The only way to substantially increase the security of the check is to add a hardware device (i. e. dongle or custom hardware card), but people generally hate those since they are usually used just for copy protection.  On the other hand, clever application of the above software techniques is probably good enough to avoid common virii, unintentional damage to files, and the average hacker.
Peace to you.
