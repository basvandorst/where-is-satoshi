Hi all,
   I have written and installed a remailer pinging script which
collects detailed information about remailer features and reliability.
   To use it, just finger remailer-list at kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu
   There is also a Web version of the same information, at
   Please do not take the uptime figures too seriously, at least for
another week or so. The script has only been running reliably for a
few days.
   Please let me know about any other remailers which I missed. I've
only included remailers which can mail to arbitrary addresses, so I
already know chop and twwells are missing.
   If you've got a Web page, please feel free to include a link to
this page. If you think your Web page is relevant to the subject of
remailers, let me know and I'll link it in.
   Comments and suggestions welcome!

   Note to remailer operators: this script generates hourly ping
messages. If you don't want that, let me know and I will take your
mailer off the list, or increase the interval between pings.

@_subject: Remailer-list pinging frequency 
Hi all,
   I believe that I am providing a useful service with my remailer
list, but I have received one complaint about the frequency of
   I send hourly pings. This is helpful for quickly identifying
remailers which have gone off the net. If you don't want me to do
this, let me know. I apologize for not having brought this up before I
started with the hourly pings.
   My pinging script can be configured to adjust ping frequency on a
per-remailer basis. If you would like a greater interval between
pings, I would be happy to do this. I already do this for penet.
   An anonymous poster from rebma criticized ping traffic as a way to
improve remailer mix. It might be that the two goals (improving mix
and collecting good statistics) are at odds, but I would be willing to
modify my ping script to make the pings more like mix-improving
traffic. Ideas include:
1. Encrypt the ping, so it looks like so much PGP traffic.
2. Pad it with a random amount of junk (but not _too_ much :-), so
traffic analysis based on size will fail.
3. Chain it through other remailers. A good approach might be to
choose two random remailers out of the "top five," and sandwich rebma
between them. The drawback is that it penalizes rebma for their
latency and failure rate, but this might be acceptable.
4. Randomize the time that the ping is sent.
   If the operator of the rebma remailer would be so kind, please let
me know if and when I have been de-Detweilered, and whether you would
like me to implement any of these suggestions.
   Also, I plan to autopost the remailer list every Monday, to both
cypherpunks and alt.privacy.anon-server. This is my first experience
with spamming the net, so if anybody has any objections or cautions, I
would like to hear them.

@_subject: Only accepting e-mail from known parties 
In fact, the security multiparts standard (RFC 1848) includes a
provision for signing the headers as well as the body of a message.
The security multiparts can be used with PGP, and there is even an
Internet Draft for it (draft-elkins-pem-pgp-02.txt), but there is not
yet consensus for adopting this as a standard on the pgp-mime mailing
list. Perhaps your example can be used to argue one the advantages of
the security multiparts approach.

@_subject: Remailers not heard from; info? 
This is simply the "cut" feature of remailers, which is already
   In response to your question about preserving subject headers,
there are actually three different behaviors. The default is to
preserve the subject header if the input message is not encrypted,
otherwise to discard it. The other two behaviors (nsub and ksub) are
to preserve or discard the subject header, respectively. I do not
recommend nsub, because it is allows tracing a message through the
subject header. No currently operational remailers have nsub behavior.
   In response to your question about remailers which haven't
responded to your tests, remail at c2.org is quite functional. I have no
idea why it did not respond. The other remailers are no longer
functional. In general, when I take a remailer off the page, it is
because it has been non-functional a few weeks, when the remailer
operator announces that it will be taken offline, or (temporarily)
when I know that the remailer will be unavailable or unreliable for a
while. There may be publicly known functioning remailers which are not
on my list, but I rather tend to doubt it.
   In general, I applaud independent work confirming or confronting my
remailer-list, but I ask that you please RTFM before doing things like
suggesting new features.

@_subject: Anonymous remailers mentioned in CDA decision 
Here's a paragraph from the findings in this morning's CDA decision.
I'm happy to see that we're considered an integral part of the
Internet, rather than as a fringe cyber-terrorism threat.
Overall, I found the decision to be balanced, well written, and
extremely thoughtful.
[ excerpted from  ]
[ from the undisputed findings of fact ]
           Obstacles to Age Verification on the Internet
          90.  There is no effective way to determine the
identity or the age of a user who is accessing material through
e-mail, mail exploders, newsgroups or chat rooms.  An e-mail
address provides no authoritative information about the
addressee, who may use an e-mail "alias" or an anonymous
remailer.  There is also no universal or reliable listing of e-
mail addresses and corresponding names or telephone numbers, and
any such listing would be or rapidly become incomplete.  For
these reasons, there is no reliable way in many instances for a
sender to know if the e-mail recipient is an adult or a minor.
The difficulty of e-mail age verification is compounded for mail
exploders such as listservs, which automatically send information
to all e-mail addresses on a sender's list.  Government expert
Dr. Olsen agreed that no current technology could give a speaker
assurance that only adults were listed in a particular mail
exploder's mailing list.
[ ... ]
                             Anonymity
          121. Anonymity is important to Internet users who seek
to access sensitive information, such as users of the Critical
Path AIDS Project's Web site, the users, particularly gay youth,
of Queer Resources Directory, and users of Stop Prisoner Rape
(SPR).  Many members of SPR's mailing list have asked to remain
anonymous due to the stigma of prisoner rape.

13, 1996 ]
22. Arguably, a valid CDA would create an incentive for overseas
pornographers not to label their speech. If we upheld the CDA,
foreign pornographers could reap the benefit of unfettered access
to American audiences.  A valid CDA might also encourage American
pornographers to relocate in foreign countries or at least use
anonymous remailers from foreign servers.
