Spoofed source-addresses can be (and often are) blocked at the
access ISP. RFC 2267, Ingress filtering.
DDOS trojans on ISDN/xDSL/Cable home user boxes will have to use
their real (or at least same subnet) source addresses on datagrams,
or run the risk of having the traffic dropped silently at the first
There is also work being done on tagging and tracing datagrams.
This won't stop DDOS attacks, but it will make it a lot harder to
mount an attack without exposing many of the DDOS trojans

The following link should give you the answer to at
least a few of the countries.

As read by the MPAA, the DMCA enable them to sell you a locked house
and then drag you to court if you try to pick the lock.
Didn't the original IBM BIOS use this trick. e.g, look for a
'copyright ibm' string in the BIOS image?

The DVDCCA license requires that DVD equipment never allow access to
the raw digital data.
It is also quite evident that the MPAA was planning to use CSS as a
'hook' to force DVD player/software/equipment manufacturers to sign
this license. Essentially creating a licensing regime protected by
This ties in nicely with the content manufacturers' dream of a
tamed digital environment where neither piracy nor fair use is
possible, and everything is pay-per-view, controlled and metered.

That is exactly how it should be, no argument there. However, there
are forces that would like to change this. The media and software
companies have so far succeeded in getting a couple of bad laws
passed (DMCA, UCITA), and are pushing heavily to force hardware
manufacturers to add 'copy protection'[2] technology to their
Unless we stop this, we might find ourselves in an Orwell'esque
world five or ten years down the line.
Some of them actually want that kind of world, and seem to have
the power, money and know-how to push both legislation and
technology in that direction.
A year ago, I would have believed that copyright law was sane, and
that the above sentence was correct. Unfortunately, (C) is a rather
messy and even internally inconsistent law which does not follow
common sense.
According to current law, that remote-music storage dotcom

there is no copyright exemption that applies to this situation,
they need to obtain a license (actually, several licenses). Is this
the way it should be? imho, no. Does this seem logical to anyone
except copyright lawyers? No. Do most laypeople expect that this
should be covered by fair use? Yes.
To fix this, we need to change copyright law. Unfortunately, the
current trend is that (C) is moving in the wrong direction, because
most of the lobbyists and most of the money are in the hands of
media companies. While DFC and EFF are trying, it seems like we
need more - much more.
Jessica Litman's 'Digital Copyright' covers a lot of this. Recommended
if you haven't read it already.
[2] 'copy protection' is a misnomer, just like Intellectual Property
is. IP isn't property, it is a limited, temporary, monopoly on an
idea (patent) or an expression (copyright). Likewise, 'Copy Protection'
is Use Control. CP is carpet-bombing from 20000ft with the expressed
intent to stop piracy, while (accidentally, or deliberately) doing
lots of collateral damage - including, but not limited to, fair use
and the principle of first sale.

Seems like the appeals court is somewhat clued, as they asked more or
less the correct questions. But as you say, it is nowhere near certain
that the court will rule our way.
