As legal as in case you hack someone's machine.
Anyhow it depends on what did you mean by your question, though,
is there any legalized hack ?

Everything you described is an abuse of administration mistakes and has
nothing to do with hacking (?) an irc/ircd. There are numerous patches
to prevent it.
As for "hacking irc" -- it is pretty indefinete what could it be...
Intruding to machine which is running an irc server isn't something new --
it is just a machine with an ircd running. Exploiting administration to hack
mistakes isn't anything new either -- there's lot's of idiotss abusing server's
code bugs, to say, +k bug to fight each other.
Anyhow, I do not thing this discussion has any future, as long as there's
nothing to discuss.

Well, as for irc, not unless you make your client do it. Though, try using
more secure dcc protocol, described as Direct Client to Client protocol --
implementing whatever you want there to be is possible and easy.
See rfc1459.
