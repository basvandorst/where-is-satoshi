G'day all.
One list member has encouraged me to write an internet-draft for a key
quorum system, so I am.  The trouble is that my proposed implementation
needs some info that isn't in the current IETF draft (the format of the
"string to key" object).
Is it actually documented anywhere that we can access?

@_subject: Is PGP still private? 
G'day all.
If we start considering that, could I suggest making the system
_completely_ flexible?
The sort of things I'm thinking of include:  Allow any object to be
encrypted using conventional encryption (including conventional
encryption keys) or signed, allow any conventional encryption key to
be public-key encrypted or split, conjunction/disjunction of two
conventional keys, etc.

Just in case anyone is interested in the Australian developments, the
EFA (Australian counterpart to the EFF) has published the Australian
government's "Review of policy relating to encryption technologies",
usually referred to as the Walsh Report.  It's available online:
BTW, the author of this report, Gerard Walsh, is a former deputy
director-general of ASIO, the Australian Security and Intelligence
Organisation.  They're the ones responsible for national security.
Other organisations which you should know about before reading are:
Now that I've set the NSA line eater buzzing with excitement, we now
return you to your scheduled technical discussion.
