As I recall the basic purpose was to make it slow in software meaning that software cracking apps were/are at a severe disadvantage vs. hardware implementations.  It would be interesting to see how much longer that extended DES's effective lifetime.   I would consider the initial permutations to be in the same category as Blowfish's (and derivative algorithm's) time consuming key expansion phase- a neat "trick" that does not improve theoretical security but significantly increases the difficulty of real world attacks.
