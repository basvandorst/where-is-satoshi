Dear Sir,
I am writing to you either as a registered user of one of Systolix free DSP
design tools (FilterExpress, FilterSim, FilterWizard), or because you have
expressed an interest in our products. As part of our development activities
we occasionally survey our software users for feedback on their ongoing DSP
and software requirements. We are currently developing our next generation
of DSP processors and tools, and would be grateful if you could take a
minute to answer 4 simple questions. Your answers will help to ensure our
future products meet your requirements. This information is purely for
marketing purposes, no sales approaches will be made as a result of your
To complete the survey, simply reply to this message with your answers typed
below the question.   1. What single feature would you most like to see included in future
releases of FilterExpress, FilterSim or FilterWizard?
2. What are your current DSP requirements for filtering application (Sample
Rates, Datawidth, Filter Type, Number of taps/Order)?
3. Have you considered using Analog Devices AD7725 converter in your
4. What hardware solution do you currently use for digital signal
conditioning functions and what is your target cost?
Many thanks for your cooperation. For more information on Systolix and it's
product please visit our web site at  FilterExpress, our
filter synthesis tool is currently undergoing a major update, look out for
an announcement soon.

@_subject: Now Available - FilterSim Version 2.0 
SYSTOLIX HAVE RELEASED FILTERSIM VERION 2.0 - INTEGRATED FILTER DESIGN,
SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS
A fully working trial version of FilterSim 2.0 can be downloaded now from
Systolix web site at  FilterSim is
the latest DSP development tool from Systolix. It combines a sophisticated
multi-stage filter design tool with an integrated digital simulator.
Simulation results can be viewed using the built-in signal viewer and
analysis tools, allowing designers to study filter characteristics and
quantisation effects in detail. Version 2.0 is a complete rewrite of the
tool, it includes a new simplified user interface to streamline the process
of specifying complex multi-stage filters.
Here is a summary of the key features, more information can be found at
  * FILTER SPECIFICATION & DESIGN *
  Import externally generated FIR / IIR coefficients for analysis /
re-quantisation   Design filters to user specified quantisation   Export coefficients   Simple graphical entry of filter networks
    - Support of multi-stage (FIR / IIR / mixed)
    - Support for multi-rate filters (decimating / interpolating /
resampling)     - Support for multiple levels of quantisation in a single network
  Support for multiple filter types including   IIR Filters
    - Butterworth / Chebychev I-II / Elliptic
    - Low Pass / High Pass / Band Pass / Band Stop   Windowed FIR Filters

    - Fast, optimised simulation engine
    - Built in signal generation functions
    - Import user test data
    - User definable quantisation for coefficients and data
    - Define unique quantisation per stage
* FILTER ANALYSIS *
  Powerful analysis capabilities including
    - Graphical view of magnitude/phase/impulse response
    - Built-in FFT     - Graphical viewer for simulation/FFT data
    - Automatic system transfer function evaluation
    - Automatic calculation of SNR / THD For further enquires about FilterSim please email filtersim at systolix.co.uk.
