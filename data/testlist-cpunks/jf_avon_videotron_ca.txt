Electronic Telegraph, UK, Dec 10 2000
Roadside DNA tests planned
By David Cracknell, Deputy Political Editor
DRIVERS or other people stopped by police could be asked to supply
on-the-spot hair or saliva samples to identify whether they are wanted
Government scientists have developed a hand-held DNA testing kit to be
carried and operated by police officers during regular patrols. The device
would be electronically linked to the national DNA database, which Tony
Blair has hailed as an essential tool in the fight against crime.
The Forensic Science Service will disclose to Parliament this week that the
equipment could be ready for standard use within a couple of years. The
testing kit, which could become as common as the breathalyser or police
baton, will dramatically cut the time it takes to match DNA evidence from
crime scenes to suspects. It will raise fresh fears among civil liberties
campaigners who believe that the pendulum has swung too far in the police's
Forensic scientists already expect that soon they will be able to use a single
hair sample to discover a suspect's eye colour, facial characteristics, height
and weight. They say that the next step will be portable testing kits that need
little technical ability to operate. The FSS will give evidence to the House of
Lords science and technology committee this week, telling peers that research
on the kits is well advanced.
It currently takes at least 48 hours to profile biological material collected from
a crime scene, but the new kits could give police an instant lead if they were
made standard issue. They would allow such tests to be carried out outside
the laboratory for the first time. A spokesman for the FSS, which is a
Government agency, said: "We feel that we have gone as far down the line as
we can in terms of what a DNA profile can tell us about an individual and the
next area we are looking at is speeding up the process."
The Telegraph has seen written evidence to the Lords committee from one of
the organisation's chief scientists, Dr Bob Bramley, and research documents.
The committee began its inquiry after becoming concerned about the dramatic
increase in the scale of DNA samples collected by the police.
Earlier this year, the Prime Minister announced an extra Â£109 million for the
expansion of the police's DNA database in Birmingham to include samples
from "the entire active criminal population" - estimated to be around three
million. The police have already collected nearly a million samples from those
convicted of an offence that carries a prison sentence. Senior officers are now
lobbying for changes in the law to allow further expansion of the database to
include innocent people who volunteer to take part in mass screenings.
Civil liberties campaigners are opposing any extension of the police's authority
to to collect samples. They cite an official report which found that thousands
of samples are being illegally held on the database because forces are failing
to remove the records of acquitted suspects. John Wadham, the director of
the human rights group Liberty, said: "The law already allows the unjustified
collection of samples and we know that there are at least 50,000 being
illegally held at the FSS database. This is not the time to relax the law."

     "...[T]he core reason the "war on drugs" completely

  --
This Ottawa Citizen expose of US bullying is dynamite - as is its
expose of many other governments' spineless surrender to that
bullying. If you can read this horror story without mounting fury,
you'd better check to see if you still have a pulse and a mind.
If you think US' drug warriors limit their bullying to backward
countries, you think wrong. Canada. Australia. Holland. The World
Health Organization. Names, dates, details: the works!
Gardner and the Ottawa Citizen merit high praise for publishing
this report; that was a courageous act in view of the systematic
vindictiveness and widespread cowardice they have exposed.
It deserves the widest distribution.
Cheers,  Mike

Reply from a non CPunks friend:
==================BEGIN FORWARDED MESSAGE==================
Hummmm !
I have loaded 7,62 and .308 cartridges in my L1A1 ( FN variant made by Lightgow ) and in my FR8 ( spanish bolt action carbine ) without any problems.
One thing though !
When you reload a military brass, you should always, always, reduce your first (tests) charges of about 10%.
Reason.  The military brass is thicker, so there is less space (volume) in the cartridge to accomodate the powder.
Not a problem when you are using BLC-2 or other similar powder, since the full charge that I was using was filling the cartridge up to the neck ( 52 grains of powder over a 125 grain softpoint bullet).  So, if by mistake, a military brass would have mixed with my "federal" brass, I would have had a big mess on my reloading press....  and not in my face.
I always used the same technique with all the calibers that I reload, and always developed powerfull but safe loads.
Apart from an empty case volume, I do not see any problem using 7,62 or .308 ammo in the same rifle.
After taking a look at the M1A1 rifle that blew up, and especially at the split shell and almost ejected primer, the only conclusion that I can come with is :
  a.. The wrong type of powder was used ( faster burning rate like pistol powder ) ;
  b.. Something was blocking the barrel ( pine needle, small rock, forgotten (!!!) cleaning cloth, etc ) preventing the bullet from exiting, and causing the pressure inside the barrel to exit through the weakest point of the rifle....OUCH !
  c.. Looking at the primer, some extraordinary pressures develop in the barrell !
  d.. So, if the barrel started splitting apart near the chamber, that would explain the split case !
Glad it wasn't my rifle...and my face !  ===================END FORWARDED MESSAGE===================

ANOTHER ANTI-HUNTING "SAAB"-STORY
In 1999, we reported that Saab Cars USA had entered into a relationship
with the largest anti-hunting extremist organization in America the
Humane Society of the United States (HSUS). Two years ago, Saab was
promoting an HSUS anti-fur campaign, and the latest issue of Saab
Magazine indicates the relationship is still strong, as it includes an
ad promoting HSUS. But does Saab also support anti-gun extremism? In the
same issue of the magazine is a story about Carl Frederick Reuterswdrd,
the Swedish artist who designed Saab's new symbol. Reuterswdrd is
probably best known for his sculpture of a revolver with its barrel tied
into a knot (a photo of the artist with this sculpture is included in
the magazine), a sculpture that
is displayed in front of the UN headquarters. If you wish to contact
Saab to express your objection to its working with anti-hunting
extremists (especially if you are a hunter who owns a Saab), please

==================BEGIN FORWARDED MESSAGE==================
CILA / ICAL               Defending Canada's Heritage
January 21, 2001
Federal government creates new secret "Gun Police"
The Federal government has secretly created a new federal police force in
Canada called the "National Firearms Enforcement Support Team (NFEST)".
This unit will be headed by Bob Frolic, formerly the leader of Ontario's
controversial "Provincial Weapons Enforcement Unit".  Mr. Frolic has headed
the PWEU for the last five years and has proven himself to be extremely
aggressive towards legitimate firearms owners.  Frolic first came to the attention of the public when his PWEU arrested ten legitimate firearms owners in Halton Region for neglecting to change their addresses on their firearms More recently, several lawsuits have been filed against the Unit for
harassment and wrongful arrest.  The Unit has also been involved in several
questionable tactics such as the coercion of paid informants and the photographing and recording of license plate numbers at both Canadian and U.S. gun shows.  As well, the Unit routinely trains with the notorious U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) and conducts numerous undercover operations in legitimate activities such as gun shows.  The Unit also boasts an abysmal conviction record.
When questioned, a CFC Information Officer would only confirm the existence
of the new federal police unit.  The Officer was extremely evasive regarding
the following questions:
- What is the NWEST's mandate?
- How is NWEST funded and how much will it cost to operate?
- How many Agents (Officers?) will NWEST have?
- Why have these firearms enforcement duties been taken away from the RCMP?
- What relationship will this unit have with the BATF?
- Does the government have to pass legislation to create this new federal
  police force?
- Will information collected by NWEST be routinely shared with BATF?
BATF activity in Canada is on a steady increase, not only in training our
law enforcement community but also in the conducting of operations.  Information regarding both law abiding Americans and Canadians is regularly Has the BATF "officially" come to Canada?
The NWEST Unit is yet another hidden cost of C-68.  Why do we need "Gun
Cops" in the first place?  Canada has one of the lowest incidents of firearms
crime in the free world and the setting up of a secret federal police force to
violate the lives of ordinary Canadians is an expensive, intrusive
undertaking our country can ill afford.
