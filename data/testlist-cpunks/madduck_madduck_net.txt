A curious idea that I've been paying some attention to for a while.
One could simply implement a means that tries to connect with IPsec
by default and falls back to IP if unsuccessful (keeping a cache of
IPsec incapable hosts). The main problem here, of course,  the
required public key repository, if you don't want to
have your keys in DNS records. And also, the expensive SA
negotiation and the potential for DoS.

Did I miss some development or why exactly does cypherpunks care
about a release candidate of libevent (or Wolfram's New Kind of
Science for that matter)? Was I frozen for that long?
