@_subject: DES bitslice S-boxes 
I've been a bit out of touch with the subject for a while, so could
someone please bring me up to speed in the state of the art of DES
bitslice. In particular, what are the best gate counts for the S-boxes?
About a year ago I produced S-boxes with the following counts
        S-box   S1   S2   S3   S4   S5   S6   S7   S8
        Gates   95   84   89   77   96   87   86   88
(You can download them from However, I was recently told that these have now been beaten by a
significant margin. I thought about it for a while, and came up with
some ideas that should improve the count, but I'd like to know what
I'm aiming for.
Any improvements I make will also be made freely available, so you
have an incentive to help me ;-)

@_subject: Bitslice DES S-boxes 
After 6 weeks of number crunching, I've finally produced a new set of
bitslice DES S-boxes using non-standard logic gates.
Numbers are as follows -
Details at There won't be any more improvements in the foreseeable future, since
I've run out of ideas.
Feel free to use this code in the RSA DES II challenge, but remember to
give credit where it's due.
