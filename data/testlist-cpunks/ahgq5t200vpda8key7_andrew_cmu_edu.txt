@_subject: Remailer delays 
I tried out a whole batch of cypherpunk remailers.  I sent ping messages to:
    remailer at chaos.bsu.edu, nowhere at bsu-cs.bsu.edu,
    hh at cicada.berkeley.edu, hh at pmantis.berkeley.edu,
    hh at soda.berkeley.edu, 00x at uclink.berkeley.edu,
    hal at alumni.cco.caltech.edu, cs60a-qu at cory.eecs.berkeley.edu,
    ebrandt at jarthur.claremont.edu, catalyst at netcom.com,
    remailer at rebma.mn.org, elee7h5 at rosebud.ee.uh.edu,
    hfinney at shell.portal.com, sameer at soda.berkeley.edu,
    remail at tamsun.tamu.edu, remail at tamaix.tamu.edu,
    remailer at merde.dis.org, remailer at entropy.linet.org,
    elee9sf at menudo.uh.edu
The ping messages were sent out at 20:27:44 EST.  Here's the ones I got
back, and the respective times:
nobody at shell.portal.com      20:30:46 (+0:03:02)
catalyst-remailer at netcom.com 20:30:55 (+0:03:11)
nobody at rosebud.ee.uh.edu     20:31:05 (+0:03:21)
nowhere at bsu-cs.bsu.edu       20:31:16 (+0:03:32)
remailer-admin at chaos.bsu.edu 20:31:27 (+0:03:43)
nobody at cicada.berkeley.edu   20:31:50 (+0:04:06)
nobody at shell.portal.com      20:32:33 (+0:04:49)
nobody at soda.berkeley.edu     20:34:01 (+0:06:17)
nobody at pmantis.berkeley.edu  20:34:14 (+0:06:30)
nobody at eli-remailer          20:37:08 (+0:09:24)
nobody at soda.berkeley.edu     20:37:26 (+0:09:42)
remailer at dis.org             20:45:48 (+0:18:04)
nobody at Menudo.UH.EDU         01:00:19 (+4:32:35)
I got mail bounces ("Unknown User") from:
remail at tamaix.tamu.edu
cs60a-qu at cory.eecs.berkeley.edu
After 24 hours, I have gotten no response from:
00x at uclink.berkeley.edu
hal at alumni.cco.caltech.edu
remailer at rebma.mn.org
remail at tamaix.tamu.edu
remailer at entropy.linet.org
I think sameer at soda.berkeley.edu just forwards to hh at soda.berkeley.edu. I got two messages back from hh at soda.berkeley.edu. elee9sf at menudo.uh.edu batches out messages at midnight (which is 1:00
My apologies to the remail operators who received the corrupted messages
from my failed first two attempts in their mailboxes.
