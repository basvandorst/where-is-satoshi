Perry sez:
  UUNET, among others, considers itself to be a common carrier.
My understanding is that, legally speaking, "considering [oneself]
to be a common carrier" amounts to exactly nil -- that it requires
a special act of some governing body to declare you to be a common
carrier.   One might just as well consider oneself to be an
accredited diplomat and therefore to have diplomatic immunity.
Any of the real lawyers on the net care to comment?

In order to cause damage, alpha emitters like plutonium must come
  in intimate contact with a material, such as the tissues of your
  lungs or bones or the inside of your favorite memory chip.  A
  billionth of a gram of plutonium inhaled or swallowed is
  something to seriously worry about, but you can hold a lump of
  the stuff in your hand as long as it is covered with a leakproof
  cladding or vitrified into a ceramic.
  It is in this sense that plutonium is extremely toxic and
  hazardous to the environment, while at the same time not being
  particularly radioactive.  Heavy shielding is not required
  between you and it.
My understanding is that the heavy metal toxicity of Pu exceeds
the radioactive toxicity by several (10?) orders of magnitude.  In
other words, the fact that Pu is an alpha emitter is irrelevant
to the risk -- it's simply like lead poisoning only several
billion times worse.
Simple arithmetic yields that the amount of alpha exposure from
a billionth of a gram of an alpha emitter with a half-life measured
in thousands of years is infinitismal.

  Cantor demonstrated, near the turn of the century, that no such system
  can represent all reals in [0,1].  Boring technical explanation follows.
  ['cept it doesn't 'cause I edited it out.]
Perhaps I misunderstood the original poster, but I assumed that
s/he was suggesting simply encoding a particular real number into
the infinite tape using standard binary encoding.  There's no
cardinality problem there at all -- but of course the tape will only
hold a single real number.  Standard tape compression techniques
will buy you enough space for a countably infinite set of reals.
Of course, the dead hand of Cantor forbids a continuous set of reals
encoded onto a TM, but we all know that he's just a Dead White Male
and therefore can be ignored.... 8-)

  Can you (without being an asshole) explain why exactly each tape
  position may contain only a simple integer?  It's perfectly reasonable
  to define the tape alphabet to be an arbitrary set; can the set not
  be uncountably infinite?  If not, why not?
Well, the "standard" in all the language stuff precludes infinite alphabets
just as it precludes infinite-length programs.  In fact, it's fairly
easy to demonstrate an equivalence betweeen the two.  I've been working
off-and-on (mostly off) for the past ten years or so trying to rewrite
Hopcroft and Ullman for the case of infinite alphabets of various
sizes, and in general, *none* of the theorems hold for problems
describably in a single input symbol.
infinite tape with an uncountable alphabet than to build an infinite
binary tape.  More generally, the problems of *programming* such a
machine are immense -- there are some very important real world
continuity/expressability properties about what sort of symbols can
be transformed into what other symbols.  Without highly discontinuous
and chaotic transformations that are informationally incompressible,
you don't get any more computational power than a standard TM.

  Seems to me the 'inalienable rights' that are mentioned in our founding   charter carry this argument quite well. I suspect they also 'prove' them
  as well.
Proof by declaration of self-evidence?  ``We hold these truths to
be self-evident.... that [all humans] are endowed by their creator
with certain inalienable rights."  If, for some reason, I claim that
the right to liberty is *not* self-evident, it can be very difficult
to convince me otherwise.
This is one of the difficulties of natural-rights arguments; that they
tend to assert certain rights (right to privacy, right to property,
right to personal space, right to free speech, &c) axiomatically when they
are often the subject of the discussion.

@_subject: Is the NSA really competent? 
Here are the biggest breakthroughs in cryptography during the period
  when the NSA has been the purported leader in the field, and   has enjoyed by far the largest budget:
  [ list of major breakthroughs deleted. ]
  For all their vaunted competence, for all the mathematicians
  they have been alleged to employ, despite having a cryptography
  budget orders of magnitude larger than any other Western
  crypto group, it looks like the NSA contribued to _none_ of   the major advances in cryptography that occured during its zenith.
My understanding is that we don't *know* what NSA actually has found.
For example, *someone* knew about differential cryptanalysis long before
Adi Shamir rediscovered it, as the DES S-boxes are optimized against it.
Similarly, they may have discovered public-key encryption fifty years
ago and simply not bothered to patent/publish it....

@_subject: Needed for a computer ethics class 
Does anyone have a concise, citeable statement about why anonymous
remailers are a good thing?  Some sort of position statment by
Julf would be ideal.  Similarly, if anyone has something for the
*other* side of the coin, I'd love to see that.
I'm in the process of writing a course on computer ethics for
the University of Colorado at Boulder and I think anonymous
remailers would be a good subject for an essay assignment, but
I need enough material (ideally, primary source material) to
lay the groundwork first.

  You're not in any way related to Detweiler are you? :-)
Nope, 'fraid not.  Never even met the "gentleman," as it happens.
I'm sure that whoever is running the Medusa style-analyzer can
bear me out on that.  8-) (That and the fact that I've been on cypherpunks for nearly a year
now, and Detweiler's not subtle enough to keep his tentacles quiet
for that long.  Feeling paranoid?)
Maybe I didn't make myself clear enough on the question.  I don't
need to be convinced that remailers are a Good Thing.  I already
believe it.  On the other hand, [I feel] it's more professional to point
the students on magazine articles, FAQ's, and stuff and to let
them draw their own conclusions about the inherent Rightness of
anonymous Email than to simple proseletyze at them, which never works.
So I'm looking for material *external* to what I'm presenting them
directly, rather than simply arguments, which I can make in the course
of the class.
