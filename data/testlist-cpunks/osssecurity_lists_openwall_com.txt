Hi! This is the ezmlm program. I'm managing the
oss-security at lists.openwall.com mailing list.
I'm working for my owner, who can be reached
at oss-security-owner at lists.openwall.com.
I'm sorry, your message (enclosed) was not accepted by the moderator.
If the moderator has made any comments, they are shown below.
If you ever have anything valuable to share, like software bugs you used
to find 10+ years ago, please feel free.  Other than that, please consider
the kind of content you've been posting lately unwelcome on oss-security.
We also have a policy to discourage CC'ing other lists on oss-security
postings (because this attracts less-relevant postings from other lists),
but of course you didn't know nor care.  (And the CC's were not
particularly bad in this case, I admit.  It's worse when someone CC's LKML.)
<<<<< -----------------
Many thanks. You fixed the _entire_ messy issue with a single `rm`.
btw, didn't your marketoid debian overlords taught you to
hypocritically say `thanks' in issues like this?
Goodbye oss-security-unsubscribe@ and debia
