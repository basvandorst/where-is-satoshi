@_subject: Spinners and compression functions 
Since there has been a lot of discussion about spinners derived from various
things (idle loops, video retrace, etc.) used as entropy sources, here is yet
another idea.  Run the spinner output through a PKZip type compression
function, and then seed a PRNG with the output from that.  This would provide
a means of gauging the amount of entropy that has been fed into the PRNG,
(count the bytes output from the compression function) which will allow the
program to disallow any output from the PRNG until a sufficient amount of
entropy has been fed into it.  Even if there are correlations in the spinner
data, (I know, that is obvious) by the time it has gone through the
compression function and the PRNG, it should be cryptographically useful,
especially if entropy from multiple sources (keyboard & mouse events, disk
access times, network access times, etc.) is used to seed the same PRNG.

I am not saying that the output of the compression function has 8 bits of

level per byte than the input to the function.  (Especially in the case of
idle loop timings, where the entropy fluctuates considerably, depending on
what the computer is doing.)  If you want to be conservative, you can assume
the output of the compression function has only 1 bit (or even less, if you

I am not talking about any "general case," I proposed compressing spinner
data, which has sequences of repeating numbers interspersed with occasional
quasi-random fluctuations.  I am not saying that compression is a "magic
wand" that will fix data streams with a lot of "fake" entropy, such as the
RND() function available in many BASIC's, which I think most of us will agree
blows chunks.
I have ZIPed the aforementioned spinner data with the built-in ZIP routines
in the PC Tools for Windows file manager.  Except for some very slight
banding (which appears to be caused by the ZIP headers) the noise sphere
plots look pretty good.  All files are available upon request for independent
I have no disagreements with this.  I merely proposed using the compression
function as a means of roughly estimating entropy and preventing the seeding
of the hash/PRNG with potentially "weak key" type data.
Would anyone like to propose a means of measuring entropy that we can all
agree on?  I haven't seen anything yet that everyone likes.

Umm, excuse me, but doesn't it take longer than 5 ms for a data packet to
transit from point A to point B?  We ARE talking about transmitting via the
Net here, aren't we?
Replaying an intercepted signature would completely unnecessary.  GPS
positions are calculated by comparing the phase differential between several
different satellite signals.  It would be trivial for anyone who understands
the inner workings of reprogram their GPS receiver (or build a hacked one) to
give a false location.  Simply calculate the distances to the satellites
relative to your position, (GPS already does this to determine your position)
and then calculate them in reference to another location. (This other
location would have to be close enough to receive signals from four of the
same satellites that you are receiving, if I remember GPS specs correctly.)
 Phase-shifting the signals according to the distance differences between
your true location and the other location yields a signal set that can be fed
into any GPS receiver to yield the other location, in real time.
See above.  Is this a troll?

Because of the fluctuations in the signals, random and otherwise, you would

 However, if you delayed all but one of the satellite signals by a few

you could effectively fake your position, and the delay would be masked by
the delays inherent in the Net by a pretty good margin.  The longer the
average packet transfer delay between you and the other party, the farther

Another thing--just a wild idea--test the randomness of encrypted data by

is something wrong with a private citizen trying to keep a secret from the
government.  ...this is the first time people have been forced to make
themselves available for surveillance.  These initiatives are not simple
government proposals in some obscure area; they are pre-emptive and
unilateral to usurp powers that previously belonged to the people.
    Clipper and Digital Telephony do not protect privacy; they force
individuals to unconditionally trust that the government will respect their

laws; we need to protect ourselves with mathematics.  Encryption is too
important to be left solely to governments."

@_subject: Multiple spinners as sources of entropy? 
In a message dated 96-03-13 02:04:12 EST, you write:
Another thing to try is to take the low-order byte of 2 timer readings based
on keystrokes (check the timer value when the key is pressed), flip one
around (so bit 0 is exchanged with bit 7, bit 1  is exchanged with bit 6,
etc.) and then XOR them together.  This will minimize the skew of any
individual bit.
You could do this with sound card samples as well.  Input noise into your
sound card (seperate noise sources for the left and right channels) and take
16-bit samples.  Take the low-order bytes of the left and right samples, flip
one around, and XOR them together.  Should be extremely random.
For a cheap noise source, use 2 Walkmans, each tuned to a different FM
station gap.  Connect them to the line inputs of the sound card, and adjust
the volume so they are almost, but not quite clipping.
Whatever method is used, running the data through a good hash function breaks
up any patterns even more.  I am working on an RC4 mutation that allows
random input and output to be processed continuously.  It stores the S-box
and the counters I and J in static variables that are preserved between
calls, and uses a status parameter to determine whether to output a byte or
input one.  Email me if interested in details.

@_subject: entropy masking (was Re: Multiple spinners as sources of entropy?) 
In DOS, the keyboard, mouse, and disk drives run on interrupts, not timers.
 If you use a timer as a spinner, such as the Windows GetCurrentTime()
function, (I MSec. resolution) and check its value each time a key is pressed
and released, It would appear that the results should be quite random,
because the keystroke is not processed in conjunction with the timer, but
rather whenever the interrupt occurs.  My tests in this area indicate that
any 8 bit value can be achieved with this method, with a fairly uniform
distribution.  My tests are not thorough (I haven't sat down and typed for 2
hours to test the distribution of the output), but results look reasonably
good so far.

In general, this is an excellent way to make smoke and big sparks, which
(since shorts tend to overtax the power supply and drop voltage levels) is a
good way to clear system RAM, thus defeating the purpose of the exercise.
 Software hacks can do the job just as well, and don't require special
breathing apparatus.

@_subject: PGP reveals the key ID of the recipient of encrypted msg 
There is a way to beat this--generate new public keys on a frequent basis,
and send them to whoever wants to send you absolutely anonymous mail in
encrypted form.  Have your anonymous partner do likewise.  Since the key ID
is fairly random, if it changes constantly, it will be irrelevant if it shows
up in a message only once.  Keep a separate (and temporary) key ring for
these temporary public keys, so you can delete the key ring files when they
start getting too large.

XORing 2 or independent thermal noise sources together would be even better.

You can wipe the master boot record by entering FDISK /MBR at the DOS prompt.
 This, in conjunction with FORMAT, will definitely get rid of any pesky

The whole 'to NTSC, or not to NTSC" debate is irrelevant, since VGA monitors
use  seperate red, green, blue, and sync signals that are not modulated on

@_subject: protection on IoMega ZIP drives 
In a message dated 96-03-23 05:19:55 EST, it was written for God and everyone
to see:
The Syquest EZ drive (130MB twice as fast as the ZIP, a little cheaper
too--around $200 for an internal drive and cartridge, with additional carts
around $20, and a 1 GB version available for $500, + $100 / additional
cartridge) comes in IDE, SCSI, and parallel flavors.  You can get an internal
IDE drive and DOS doesn't know or care that you can replace the cartridge.
 You can DoubleSpace the drive, (I have personally done this) so you should
be able to SecureDrive it too.  It is a full fledged IDE (or SCSI) drive.

@_subject: So, what crypto legislation (if any) is necessary? 
To Jim Bell and "Black Unicorn":
I have been following your debate with interest, and would like to re-iterate
some points that were made and add some of my own.
The concept of encrypting a key before escrowing it is excellent.  It
prevents the escrow agent from misusing the key, and protects the principal
from government snooping.  If the escrow agent is served a subpoena, he can
say, "Here is the key you want. Go ahead and take it.  In fact, here is my
entire key database.  All keys are encrypted by the principals before I get
them, so I can't guarantee that you will be able to use them, but here they
are anyway."  At this point, the LEO's can take whatever they want, but the
principals are still safe.  The escrow agent doesn't have to send any
encrypted "rosebud" message to anyone, and he can bend over backwards to make
the LEO's happy, so his butt is covered, too.  At this point, the LEO's can
either (a) send the keys to the NSA for decryption, and thereby admit that
the gov't can break IDEA (or whatever cryptosystem was used to encrypt the
keys before the escrow agent got them), (b) rubber hose the unencrypted
key(s) from the principal, or (c) go home and pout.
Of course, if you never escrow your keys, you can avoid the whole scenario
altogether, leaving the gov't with options (b) and (c).
