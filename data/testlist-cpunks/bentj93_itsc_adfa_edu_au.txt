I was using something similar called SLAP or somesuch -- Australian product.
It worked quite well and might even be worth digging up now as an odball
way of multiplexing a telnet session (eg to improve the utility of restricted access machines).
Tried dingoblue? $27.50 unlimited if you also sign up fo rtheir long distance
service (which is also cheap).
Be sure to quote 100641226 when you sign up and we'll both get $40.

That's simply a result of the dim-bulb "first past the post" voting system
that the US (and apparently you) endure. In countries with electorates that
are expected to be able to count past 1 (eg Australia) they have preferential voting and you can express your preferences from 1 to N
(the number of candidates).
This allows you to express your preference for libertarian drug-taking
pornographers and still have an equal impact on the outcome.

In single transferable vote systems the winner is almost always one
of the two candidates with the most first preferences; the minor
party candidates get progressively eliminated and the corresponding
votes distributed to the next in preference order (instead of being
thrown away).
In US terms such a system might have got Bush senior over the line
against Clinton because he would (I presume) have been preferred by
most voters who voted for that fellow with big ears. In the coming election it might help Gore overcome Bush because Gore
would be strongly preferred by most voters who are planning to waste
their votes on Nadir.
A system based on weights would, as you suggest, have an excessive
(political) centrist tendency.

A human can easily remember 26 random letters from a 32 character alphabet with a little mnemonic method (eg map each character to a word so that it makes up some sort of dumb story). 5*26==130 which
is more bits than computers can currently exhaust over.

Sure, probably 70% or more of real apss phrases are crackable, but that's
not strictly the fault of the software. It doesn't really matter either, if they &really& have no "reason/incentive to guard their privacy".

Well to do coke-heads had been "freebasing" the alkaloid (free base)
for years before crack was invented. Crack just made the same thing
available in small quantities to the (black) masses and a panic
