@_subject: cypher-list for telcom legislation 
be prudent to remind everyone that there is a PGP encrypted mailing list
called cypher-list. It can be subscribed to by sending email to
cypher-list-request at vishnu.alias.net. All messages and transactions are
encrypted. The code is a little buggy but it works for the most part. It
seems that cypher-list would make an excellent platform for discussion on
the telcom legislation and maybe even ways to thwart it. If you have
trouble subscribing, perry at vishnu.alias.net has been very helpful. (he got
me on!)
