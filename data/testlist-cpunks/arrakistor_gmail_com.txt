@_subject: Torpark v.1.5.0.3 pre-release 
Howdy all,
New  version of Torpark available. Here is the english demo
without NoScript. I'll have the rest of the packages built
a little later. Let me know if you find any bugs. Also, if
anyone has win95 or win98 running, I would be interested to
find out how it turns out.
- Using Tor v0.1.1.18
- Tor log file is written to the temp directory while Torpark is running.
- all plugins now write to the executable temp direcory instead of the
local directory. Directory is deleted when Torpark exits.
- ExecDos.dll garbage bug fixed
- NoScript WILL be added for this next version, as javascript sites have
  been quietly loading disallowed flash plugins, compromising security.
- Torpark is again, smaller and faster. New splash as well.

@_subject: xB Browser automated build process 
We have a NSIS automated build process. So anyone can now build xB
Browser based on the SVN repository. It takes any version of xB Browser
you select, and then builds that against the latest library files, the
result is a fully completed XeroBank Browser Installer file, not just
the package.
Steve Topletz
The short version:
compile XeroBank Installer.nsi
The long version:
svn://support.xerobank.com/xbbrowser/Installer - Main build directory.
svn://support.xerobank.com/xbbrowser/Library - Static files of Tor,
Firefox, and profile. Replace as you please.
svn://support.xerobank.com/xbbrowser/Latest - Latest build of xB
Browser, installer looks for xBBrowser.exe from this directory.
1. First you designate which xB Browser version you want. Installer by
default selects the "Latest" directory, but you can change this in
Installer/XeroBank Installer.nsi, at the PACKAGEVER definition. For
example "2.0.0.10a".
2. Make sure a xB Browser executable is available to make into the
package. Whatever directory you selected for PACKAGEVER, be sure to
compile _build.nsi first to generate a xBBrowser.exe.
3. Update the Library directory to include any version of Tor or Firefox
you like. Tor is at App/tor, Firefox is at App/Browser, Portable PuTTY
is at App/Xerobank/XeroBankPlus.exe, Firefox browser profile is at
4. Compile XeroBank Installer.nsi, and it will pack up the xB Browser
executable and all the library files in App and Data. The result is a
complete installation program.
This doesn't yet go to the web and snag the latest tor and firefox, but
it's a lot further along. The next version will probably break apart the
library directory. If you are missing any plugins, they are included in

@_subject: [gsc] XeroBank CryptoRouters now available 
Normal traffic goes in, encrypted traffic comes out.
Now it's easy to achieve communications integrity. Plug in a
CryptoRouter into your network, and all traffic passing through
it will be protected by XeroBank's Blacknet. CryptoRouters create
instant internet anonymity, and can be used to anonymously link
remote office environments through closed-group routing.
CryptoRouters are designed to be the ultimate network security
device. They extend the XeroBank network and it's protection to
wherever they are installed. All communications routed through
the CryptoRouter are transparently encrypted and anonymized. They
are equipped with the VIA Padlock encryption engine, allowing a
throughput of up to 20 Gbps of AES-256 encryption.
