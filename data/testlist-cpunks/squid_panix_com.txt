FUNDING:   $370K
PRIOR FUNDING:   Low seed
ROUND:   1st
CATEGORY:   Software
DESCRIPTION:   Develops monitoring software applications for
instant messaging (IM) platforms.
LEAD INVESTORS:   Two Japanese angels, Jun Makihara and
Joichi Ito
OTHER INVESTORS:   None
THE HERRING TAKE:   Fatbubble has designed a monitoring
software solution that collects anonymous information on
users and sells it to marketers. But there's a twist.
Instead of following Net surfers, Fatbubble is tracking the
navigational habits of IM users. "We're building vast
behavioral maps that track the movements and influences
among a large network of users," says CEO and cofounder
Brady Bruce. The implications for marketers and consumers
are vast, and call into question privacy concerns. The
affable chief declares sternly that Fatbubble is not
intercepting IM discussions. Rather, the startup is charting
the Web destination points that IM users visit. Once this
information is collected, it'll sell it to marketers. Thus
far, that's Fatbubble's only revenue stream, as the software
is available for free. Mr. Brady harbors grand plans for his
modest startup and will launch his product first in the
States later this summer, and then take it to Japan and
Western Europe. Fatbubble is burning $8,000 per month and
has a post-money valuation of $3.5 million. The startup is
looking to raise $3 million for its second round. Mr. Brady
will consider all offers. --R.B.R.

@_subject: BayTSP: anti-digital piracy startup 
as seen in Red Herring, who observe that the
'automatic shutdown' of sites it doesn't like could
be problematic, to say the least:
BAYTSP, $3M
San Jose, CA
THE PITCH:   "BayTSP is emerging with the leading technology
solution to online piracy of digital media. The company has
developed and deployed a sophisticated spidering and
detection service that identifies infringing files by their
digital 'DNA,' and proceeds to automatically investigate and
shut down the offending sites. Customers in the pipeline
include Viacom, the NFL, and major record labels. With a
slim team, low burn, and virtually no marketing expense,
BayTSP has already attracted attention and interest from the
major record labels and music publisher organizations in
their fight against Napster and other peer-to-peer file
sharing networks."
WHY WE LIKE IT:   Interest from major customers.
WHAT THEY'RE UP AGAINST:   Automatic detection and shutdown
of infringement could lead to disaster if there's a mistake

Yeah, that's an explanation.
But this is too trivial a metter to care about.

Dynamic sites should not be a problem,
unless they require users to submit forms
before they see the real content.
A google cache of a dynamic site eg omor.com might have something like
'This page Optimized for 216.239.46.66, googlebot(at)googlebot.com,
 using Googlebot/2.1 (+ .

In the current environment in the USA, that would be, 'XYZ airlines
denied use of US airspace' or 'denied use of anywhere within range of
US airspace.'
The problem with torts to address danger to others is that the potential value of the torts for events such as 0911
is so huge, nobody could afford to pay the damages.   Alas, pre-emptive action to prevent such threats seems resonable.
This resobning should not be used to justify stupid, inept and counter
-productive pre-emtive action, but of course it will.
  "Despite all the rhetoric and mobilization of the police and military,
   the only real act of successfully opposing terrorists occurred when
   civilians took matters into their own hands on the fourth hijacked
   plane on September 11. While our government has failed miserably to
   protect anyone, this foiling of a fourth attack, apparently targeted
   against the White House, shows that our fellow citizens are still our
   best defense." -  [ Various good points about competition and diversity of
  security measures deleted.]

You get totals per nation, per state, per county, per riding,
per precinct, per polling stion and maybe per ballot box.
So there's a need to design the system to have more voters
than ballot boxes to conform to your second law.
