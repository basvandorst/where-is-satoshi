Friday June 22 1:32 PM ET          Group Seeks Injunction to Block
         Racist Web Site
         By Catherine Bremer
         PARIS (Reuters) - A French anti-racism group is
         asking for an injunction to block access to a neo-Nazi
         U.S. Web portal, a move set to fuel a running debate
         about Internet controls.
         International Action for Justice (AIPJ), whose action
         comes amid transatlantic wrangling over a separate
         case against U.S. Internet service provider Yahoo!
         over xenophobic sites, wants France cut off from the
         U.S. ``Front14'' portal which acts as a free speech
         space for racists.
         Front 14's Web site, which carries the slogan ``online
         hate at its best,'' offers domain hosting, web animation
         and web marketing services for neo-Nazi
         organizations wanting to get onto the Internet.
         The site currently groups well over 400 racist Web
         sites and has scores more under construction,
         according to the AIPJ, which will seek the injunction
         in a Paris court on June 29.
         The debate pits those concerned about the proliferation
         of extreme material on the Internet against proponents
         of free speech and highlights the difficulties in
         applying national censorship laws to the Web.
         ``We are asking these national ISPs to prevent access
         to an address that is offering hosting and web services
         for illegal, neo-Nazi militant Web sites,'' said AIPJ's
         lawyer Stephane Lilti.
         ``We need to solve this problem. We cannot tolerate
         our laws being flouted by this site which acts like an
         incubator for nearly 500 neo-Nazi sites,'' he told
         Reuters, noting that some of the sites in question are
         based in France.
         AIPJ wants General Communication Inc., a U.S. Web
         site hosting company which carries front14.org, to be
         banned from offering access to the Web site to
         France-based Internet users.
         It also wants French ISP association AFA, whose
         members include all major French providers covering
         87 percent of French Web users, to block access to the
         site.
         However, the AFA, which was not immediately
         available for comment Friday, has told the AIPJ it will
         not back its stand and argued that limiting access to
         Front14 would infringe on privacy rights as it would
         require controls on all Web users.
         Chicago-based General Communication was also
         unavailable for comment.
         The case comes amid an ongoing spat over a French
         lawsuit filed last year by barrister Charles Korman
         which resulted in a Paris court ordering Yahoo! to
         alter its American servers so that France-based Web
         surfers could not access Nazi-related material on the
         Internet. Yahoo! is still fighting the ruling.
         The Council of Europe is drafting the world's first
         treaty against cybercrime, a text due to be approved
         this month which could become a global standard to
         fight Internet crime.
         But the treaty has come under fire for being vague and
         Council deputies have expressed disappointment that
         there is no specific provision to make it illegal to
         spread racist propaganda and hate messages on the
         Web.
         ``Incitation to racial hatred is a crime and everybody
         knows that. And technically it is quite possible for
         ISPs to blacklist certain Web sites,'' Lilti said.

thieves apparently have a new high-tech
            tool in their arsenal. A credit card
            terminal maker says it has discovered
            the existence of small, number-stealing
            electronic Âbugs.Â The devices can be
            secretly placed inside store terminals,
            where they ÂskimÂ card numbers with
            each transaction. The bugs are even
            smart enough to trick a terminal into
            Âphoning home,Â delivering batches of
            stolen numbers to fake credit card
            manufacturing locations. While
            acknowledging the threat may be real,
            Visa International and other terminal
            makers caution that use of the James
            Bond-esque device is hardly
            widespread.

Tuesday June 26 9:18 AM ET          Teen Sues Over Banned
         'Redneck' Shirt
         NEWARK (Reuters) - Tom Sypniewski thought his
         ``redneck'' t-shirt was funny, but school officials
         deemed it offensive, ordered him to remove it and are now being
sued for
         allegedly violating his free speech rights.
         Sypniewski, 19, wore the shirt, which listed comic Jeff
Foxworthy's ``Top 10
         Reasons You Might Be A Redneck Sports Fan,'' to Warren Hills
         High School on March 22 and was told to remove it. He refused
and was
         suspended for three days, losing an appeal to the Board of
Education in April.
         District school officials in Washington, a small town in rural
western New
         Jersey, said in a press release the shirt ''portrayed a message
of racial
         stereotyping'' and violated the dress code. It said the shirt
could have inflamed
         students, given the school's two-year history of racial
         Sypniewski, who recently graduated, denied he is a racist or
that the shirt
         carried a racist message.
         ``I wore it because it's funny,'' Sypniewski told a news
conference outside
         U.S. District Court in Newark on Monday. ``To me a redneck is a
hunter, a
         fisherman, an outdoorsman. I consider myself a redneck and I'm
absolutely not
         a racist. What hurts me is the board accused me of trying to
spread a racist
         message with the shirt. I think they owe me an apology.''

Tuesday June 26 5:28 AM ET          Beau Blushing As Scorned Girl Vents Fury on
         Net
         LONDON (Reuters) - A British woman has published photographs of
         boyfriend wearing skimpy panties and a bra on the Internet to
avenge his
         cheating ways.
         The 22-year-old, who identified herself only as ``The
Pimptress,'' said
         boyfriend ``Tom'' had asked her never to show the snaps of him
in various
         poses wearing her shiny red underwear.
         ``Guess he shouldn't have cheated with my best m8,'' she wrote,
using for the
         word ``mate'' the abbreviated text message language popular for
         communicating by mobile phone.
         The picture gallery of 20 snaps includes shots of ``Tom''
trying to squeeze on a
         pair of girl's cowboy boots and putting on makeup.
         By early Tuesday the Web site,  had
         nearly 6,500 hits, or visits by Internet readers. After it was
featured in the
         best-selling daily tabloid The Sun, that number was rising
fast.

@_subject: codes of the hispanic unlicensed pharmaceutical distributors 
Simple codes were used during the operations of the business - for
example, many words were made up almoset like
a Spanish version of Pig-Latin - "Coban" meant Banco, or bank, "Tebille"
meant "Billette" or cash, "Tabogo" was
Bogota... also some words were simple substitutions: if someone was
"sick", that meant they had been spotted by the
police, various numbers needed to be multiplied by several thousand to
arrive at the real amounts, depending heavily
on context. "Five pesos" was generally five hundred dollars, while "One
Peso" was generally a million. Some more
peculiar shorthand was "Rock and roll" (in English) for car, if they had
a "Colibri", that was a tail, and handcuffs
were referred to as "engagement rings" in a few cases. Another code was
used between the drug lords in Columbia
and Caliche to talk about phone numbers - the word "CONTEMPLAR" was used
to correlate the first letter of a name
with a number, e.g. "Tomas, Carlos, Olivier" would be "T,O,C" or 420. On
top of this, each worker had a code
number to identify himself when beeping Caliche or each other to have
them call back. There were a few other
beeper codes, like "51", meaning "A Successful round" or transfer of
cash or drugs, while "911" meant an urgent
message.

Wednesday June 27 6:47 AM ET           World Court Favors Germany
          Over U.S.
          THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) - The World Court
          ruled in favor of Germany in a case involving the U.S.
          execution of two German brothers in 1999, saying the
          United States violated international law when it failed
          to grant consular rights to Germans.
          In a landmark ruling Wednesday, the court also
          pronounced that its provisional orders to national
          courts were legally binding, criticizing the U.S. state
          of Arizona for ignoring the World Court's order to
          delay the execution of one of the brothers.
          Brothers Karl and Walter LaGrand were executed in
          Tucson for the 1982 murder of a 63-year-old bank
          manager during a botched robbery.
          Germany took the United States to court, claiming the
          brothers had been denied representation by the German
          consulate that might have saved their lives. In doing
          so, Germany argued, the United States violated the
          1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.
          The verdict is binding and not subject to appeal,
          however the World Court has no independent means to
          enforce compliance.

Choate pointed & grunted to:                 thieves via the Net is due to land in Europe by the end
                this year.                 The software, developed by US company zTrace, activates
                a tracing technology when stolen laptops are connected
                the Internet. Boy that's hard.  All you need is a fixed IP (for laptop to check if its
reported stolen) and a 1-800 number (well, the Euro equiv which gives
caller's number) and a warrant (ergo the required police report) for
the number's meatspace loc'n from the local Telecom.  Someone should do a freeware knock off.
A software dead-man switch (tell the laptop a secret or it reports
itself stolen
to a 1-800 trace...) would work just as well.
And you can forget the 1-800 if you can count on the equiv of 911

The DCMA folks need to understand this.  Badly.  [1] An OEM may not be always be able to void a warrantee for objectively

drive-train warrantee because you used generic oil that fullfilled published specs.
