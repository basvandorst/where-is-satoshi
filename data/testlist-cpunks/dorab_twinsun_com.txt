@_subject: PGP encryption for HTML forms 
I've developed a simple protocol for encrypting the submission of HTML
forms using PGP.  I've written up the protocol in an "Internet Draft".
We are distributing two reference implementations (with sources ---
copyrighted, but freely redistributable).  One is a modification to
lynx sources to handle this protocol natively.  The other is a "helper
application" (by Jun Hamano) to do the encryption written in python.
You can get the package via anon ftp.
Comments welcome.
Snarf it before it becomes illegal!
