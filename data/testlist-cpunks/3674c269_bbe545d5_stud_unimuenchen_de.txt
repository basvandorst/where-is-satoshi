@_subject: German government press release on Wassenaar 
I posed a question in this direction in sci.crypt in the thread
'(fwd) Strike to protest Wassenaar!' to which Doug Stell gave a
follow-up on 11 Dec 14:19:24 which is attached below.

a. "Public domain" is defined in the document you refer to, by the
indentations under Item 1.
b1. 128-bit software is never exempt.
b2.  64-bit software is exempt if you meet ALL of the other criteria.
b3. The limit of exemption is 56 bits, if you do not meet all of the
other criteria.
See my other response where this is explained from Catgory 5 - Part 2.
Unfortunately, one key statement is missing from the General Software
Note and it contains the magic word "ALL."
