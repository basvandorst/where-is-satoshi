Nothing unusual about the press getting things wrong.
As I understand it, you bind someone to a board, incline it fairly
steeply with feet above head, and dunk just their head.  They actually
feel like they're drowning, but since the lungs are above water level,
it's hard for them to actually drown.  Harder, at least, than it would
be to suffocate them using cellophane and dunking them, which is the
version I got from the media.
Pneumonia and things of that sort might be a problem, if the torturee
isn't in great health.
