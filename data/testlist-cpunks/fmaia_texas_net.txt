New paint blocks out cell phone signals
ROCHESTER, N.Y., March 1 (UPI) -- A Rochester, N.Y., company has
developed paint that can switch between blocking cell phone signals
and allowing them through.
"You could use this in a concert hall, allowing cell phones to work
before the concert and during breaks, but shutting them down during
the performance," said Michael Riedlinger, president of NaturalNano.
Using nanotechnology, particles of copper are inserted into
nanotubes, which are ultra-tiny tubes that occur naturally in
halloysite clay mined in Utah. Combined with a radio-filtering device
that collects phone signals from outside a shielded space, certain
transmissions can proceed while others are blocked, the Chicago
Tribune reported.
However, the wireless phone industry is up in arms over the development.
"We oppose any kind of blocking technology," said Joe Farren,
spokesman for The Wireless Association, the leading cell phone trade
group. "What about the young parents whose baby-sitter is trying to
call them, or the brain surgeon who needs notification of emergency
surgery? These calls need to get through."
