@_subject: Swiss Bank Accounts Online (not spam) 
In the spirit of throwaway hotmail accounts, online "Emoney" accounts
now are available for a minimum deposit of just US$200 dollars, euros,
or Swiss francs.  These are fiat currencies, not something like e-gold,
and the identity requirements seem no more stringent than recieving
your mail at Mail Boxes Etc.
Although there have been some recent concerns over Swiss baking privacy
), using an assumed identity (like one might for a HushMail account)
could provide some degree of anonymity.
