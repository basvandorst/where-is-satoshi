But then you still have the problem of identifying the contents.  If there
were no headers, one could not tell if the message was compressed using
ZIP, LHA, StuffIt, tar*, compress, gzip, Alice's Magical Supercompressor,
or even if it was left alone.  One could also not tell if the decryption
happened successfully.
( * Yes, I know tar is not compression. )
