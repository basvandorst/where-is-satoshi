We have met the enemy, and it is not the system.
Responding to msg by jdd at aiki.demon.co.uk (the real Jim Dixon):
Regardless of how this discussion began originally, the only part that I was commenting on had to do with John's remark that since governments & societies are both beastly, composed of people of that sort of character,  what is it that we think we are going to do if the governing system of operations is overthrown? From this I read:  what difference does it make if the present system (the best in the world) is removed, since the objections to it are not also resolved by that action, seeing as how the character of its parts (the people) remains the same; and what is thereby left, if it is successfully un-done? (anticipation: more of the same, but worse, and more difficult for the individual to deal with the consequences)?  This was said in the context of a discussion of systems, with reference to what the system which we are governed by (controlled) offers, and how this compares to the feasibility & success of systems per se to accomplish desired ends.
It is true that systems are of different kinds & types:  from the non-conscious physical which existed prior to the presence of humans on the planet,  to fully conscious, reasoned plans of action (as you said:  designed).  A family may be conceived (by some people) as a system of operations and sometimes it functions that way, although lately they seem to be mostly dis-functional.  Families are started whether anyone is fully self-aware, or in control of, their nature; it's usually the result of other motivations unrelated to wanting to control mankind so that it can be morally improved and will function cooperatively as a harmonious whole.
But a system designed for the purpose of corralling the disparate energies of a large group of diverse individuals (who are not necessarily in the family) cannot (should not) merely "bumble along" in a mindless sort of way, supposing that everyone is going to agree to and abide by every decree which is delivered to them, for the satisfaction of a purpose which they may not fully appreciate.  Human beings are pretty adaptable, but if the governors blithely promulgate measures for living which grates on the sensibilties of the constituency, this is the time when surprising aspects of 'human nature' rears a heretofore invisible head.  This is when they begin to 'raise hell'.  This is when you realize that it would have been better for someone to know a little more about the facts & the truth & the real nature of mental beings, so that these problems could have been prevented  (but nooooooooooooo, there have to be loud, angry debates and arguments and fights and wars, etc.)  Apparently, SomeBody didn't know what to expect, didn't plan on it, or didn't care.
I don't just propose that a person exercise, develop, and use their own judgement:  I recommend it.
One may be caught in a system which they were just born into and seems to be 'just there'.  But exceptional people, like Thomas Aquinas, might decide to devote their life to reason and seek to know what lies beyond the immediate given.  A system is useful for coordinating efforts towards a particular goal, if all of those who participate in the activities are rewarded by the results.   Whether it was there when you first became conscious of being alive or whether it is a recently bright idea, if it does not bring satisfactory results & returns, what could it make sense to suffer it?  You may not have a choice initially about the system within which you find yourself, but you will be led to the felt need to make alternative choices by your unhappiness with it;  you will have to decide what to do about it  -  stay or go, improve or tear down?  You will have to think about what you depend upon (or whom) for the realization of your requirements or desires (something the Bengalis realized subconsciously), and you will have to take a measure of your happiness/disatisfaction and try to determine what will work better.  Covertly or otherwise.
Blanc I really don't mean to prolong a discussion which lies so far away from the list topics;  I do think, however, that there are reasons for the way things are & the way things work, and the better grasp that one has of these reasons, the better that one can compute regarding the right actions to take or the judgements which one will bring to bear upon the actions of others as they affect oneself.

@_subject: Voluntary Governments? (Oh, Poleece!) 
Some hidden, subliminal messages which were missed in the reply to thoughts about the concept of governance (delete if you don't find this exciting):
i.e.:    Is it a 'what' which needs to be governed, or is it a           Is it 'crime' which needs to be governed, or any and all of the members of that association who generally require  regulation?  To simply enter into an association with strangers for the purpose of being governed is a strange thing to agree to do; it's like an admission of personal deficiency  ("SomeBody Stop Me!").  But of course, most people think that it will be 'others' who wil be governed, rather than i.e.:   Can the members of the association distinguish accurately between the good, the bad, and the merely ugly?  In the U.S. it is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness which are to be upheld, but who can say that these are truly appreciated & successfully defended?  The values are listed in the precious original documents, but the education and the behavior of the citizens contradicts them.
i.e.:   What are the victims going to be doing while their values are being encroached upon, or ignored?  If the job of self-defense is given up to someone else,  their ability to distinguish  'criminal' behavior from otherwise innocent/ignorant mistakes, must be established -  and who will be the best judge of this, besides oneself? There is a danger in that an individual could become intellectually flabby, their ability to be of practical use in their own regard atrophying from inactivity.  And then who would know who is qualified to reason on the matter?  They could be fooled; they could be led down to the river to leap in.
i.e.:    People who ask for rules (there oughta be a law) are the ones most inclided to break them.  Rules often substitute for active intelligence, for the need to think about what one is doing and the evaluation of the outcome.  But it really becomes absurd to speak of non-conformism in a voluntary system.   If it's voluntary, anybody who doesn't want to follow the rules can simply leave, they don't have to hang around waiting for the administration of a 'punishment' of any kind  (anybody who stays doesn't have any self-esteem).
The most important question was overlooked:
.   What makes you such an authority on government?   i.e.:   What makes someone think that it is alright to put any one person as an authority over the mind of another?  Authority should be earned through admiration.  It is Reality which should govern one's decisions, not the overshadowing or overwhelming of one's mental functions by another; it is what should be recognized as 'the' authority by which to regulate one's behavior.

Everyone wants ease-of-use, but no one wants to have their system made  vulnerable by it.
Everyone wants wide markets, but no one wants to have easily  duplicatable products.
Everyone wants to corner the market for their product, but no one wants  a monopoly of one - or a reduction in choices.
..    Would you say that ideally all electronic information should be  encrypted as a matter of course; is it the best circumstance to have  absolutely everything encrypted, with systems or processes for access  available only to select or paying members of the chosen cabal, no exceptions?
      Given that personal information is  shared almost automatically between & among all sorts of businesses &  gov. agencies, and that in order to prevent that, laws & regulations would be called on to put the label of illegality & the force of the law behind them:
..     How could (would, should?) the procurement of services, where one  is requested to give out personal financial or other information in  order to receive them, be accomplished in an anarcho-capitalist system  of operations whereby interactions/transactions might be 'illegal' yet  supremely functional & directly beneficial, while not also being  intrusive & offensive? How could all of this data be 'contained' so  that it would not be irreverently distributed by irresponsible  parties?

I wasn't going to add to this discussion anymore, but I couldn't believe it.  I didn't use to think that it was so difficult to distinguish between "real" government and any other kind of controlling influence.  Reflecting upon the difference between kinds of control and the difference it makes, I made a list of important elements which help me identify what kind of a yoke is over my neck:
.  governance by force = control .  the direction of the intended influence:
   a withholding of services & benefits, or
   an imposition over the individual
.  the duration of that controlling influence:
   related to a specific event, or
   maintained ever-presently as a matter of course
.  the scope of the influence:
   specific to a particular function, or encompassing a geographic area;
   limited to family, friends, or
   inclusive of all mankind, or perhaps    encompassing every living thing on the planet as well
   all the mineral rights and all the forests and the seas
.  the kind of control being exerted:
   dependent upon an individual's self-committment, or
   having overriding precedence
.  expected complicity from the recipients:
   their apparent willingness to knowingly subject themselves to another's ministrations, or
   their protests against obligatory participation
.  recognition of Authority:     passive recipience, or active participation;
   acknowledging the other party's sovereignty; or
   not considering themselves subjects of it
.  how those in control "achieve" or ascend to their position of authority over all others within that system, and .  how the relationship to that authority is managed:     by the individual's own attraction/desires for the possession or reception of things which s/he does not have;
   by threats against the capacity for self-determination & .  what it is that "they" are aiming for:   what do they want from those upon whom they exert influence or control:
   -  their business
   -  attention
   -  their material property
   -  their soul
   -  support for their delusions of grandeur
Otherwise, I can usually tell because they give themselves names like "United", "National", "World", or because all of the individuals within that jurisdiction presumably belong to it and assume the identity of the organized entity; they are known outside of it by its name (Americans, Greeks).

[more excruciatingly enlightening grandiloquence]
Responding to msg by Phil Karn:
. . . .  how can one create a government  that rises above the petty illiberalism of the people it governs to protect the rights of the individual?
 ...................................................
It appears that being given a position in charge of upholding abstract ideals makes some people forget whose interest or which ideal it is that they are supporting, and they take too seriously the opportunity to lord over others.  When someone has been given responsibility over others, they seem to suddenly lose their perspective and propose all sorts of things contrary to what they claimed to think prior to assuming that I think there will come a time when business enterprises will completely replace 'government' functions.  Most people see both society and political systems as means to practical ends.  These two organizations have pragmatic functions which individuals see as advantageous to their own comfort and advancement.  When neither of these deliver on the promise of the desired benefits, all of those who were depending upon them complain that their expectations were betrayed.  It remains to 'overthrow' these organizations or raise hell at least, but still conditions remain largely unsatisfactory.
A business enterprise is more precisely a tool for the realization of the kind of benefits which people are looking for from each other.  It also has the advantage of flexibility -  it can be modified to suit or disbanded altogether without affecting uninvolved parties in the same way as must happen when attempting to "improve" a society or a government.
A company does not recognize an individual in the same way that a society or a government does in terms of a comprehensive ideal, but it can better provide the means to achieve personal goals & ambitions, and I think is thus better suited as a tool for providing (read 'creating') what individuals could want from the world while living in co-existence with strangers.

@_subject: The Trouble With Crypto 
Responding to msg by nobody at ds1.wu-wien.ac.at:
 I see a limited deployment, and almost no  You might be right, having accrued at least 10 reasons why the list discussions do not altogether convince of the importance of using encryption as a matter of course or for the re-structuring of society.
The choice to use crypto is a little different from the sense of wanting to use it from desperation; I think it is the difference between determining factors:  when it is the individual themselves who decide to employ the tool for whatever reason they have to either use it or not at their discretion, or when the circumstance seems to dictate for the person what they must do -   that they must go to desperate means to ensure privacy, from a perceived threat which demands that they hide their communication.
One of the important issues regarding the use of encryption is not necessarily whether it is used or not as a matter of course, but rather the controversy over the source of the permission to use it as well as the imposed obligation to participate in self-incriminating applications of it.  i.e. do individuals have the sovereign right to use tools which result in a division between public & private existence, or are they obligated to keeping their lives accessible to intervening governing agencies?  To me a cumbersome tool would require sufficient cause to use it.  However, I would appreciate its existence in case of emergency, if there was no better one available, and I would protest the idea that it was anyone else's prerogative to decide for me when it was an appropriate occasion to do so.
Is crypto only a toy with destructive implications for governments & societies, or a tool of subjugation with destructive implications for individuals?  If only cypherpunks or only government officionados made the decisions about it the answers would be easier to predict.  But they are not the only ones involved, and it is my understanding that not all future developments will be determined on this list. Blanc

Responding to msg by nobody at ds1.wu-wien.ac.at I have read in public & private, comments about cypherpunks and how there is really little to be expected from the list in terms of practical solutions to governments, surveillance, the new world order, etc.
It sets me to reflect upon what people could really expect to get from a mailing list;  why it is that there is disillusionment about what the members seek to accomplish, such that there are discrediting comments about what will really happen as a result of its existence:  what is it that leads some people to expect that reading other people's mail is going to change the NSA's mind, or the world at large?  Is it because "real" cypherpunks write code?  Perhaps the expectations for the range of the efficacy of coding are a little too high in some people's estimation?  (Just because criminals & the NSA think it's important, doesn't mean e-v-e-r-y-b-o-d-y else will think so, too.  Okay, so you're going to disagree with me about that.  So flame me.)
I must reflect upon the fact that this is, after all, just a list -  just reading material and interchange from anyone who feels sufficiently motivated to reply or comment or just send in their .02 cents.  Perhaps someone's intellect could supply imaginative inspiration, perhaps their knowledge could provide missing pieces to a puzzle, perhaps their style could bolster a failing courage towards autonomous thinking & therefore acting.  What could really be realized from a voluntary gathering of various & sundry assorted strangers who subscribe for their own self-decided particular reasons, which they don't divulge to all, to get what they will and contribute what they may at such time as they feel sufficiently motivated to do so?

It could also be said, somewhat loosely, that criminal theft is just the result of people who do not protect their property. For them it's as easy as falling off a log:  the big G will just keep getting worse and taking over more (Somebody Stop Me!).  The 'evolutionary' pressure on Government tends to go in the direction away from keeping accurate accounts, including keeping an eye on the consequences of policies & procedures.  They would rather not note what the real source of new goods and wealth is, and they would rather not keep track of the success/failure of their legislative constructs.  All this pressure towards backsliding on the evolutionary scale means that the big G will accept being as dependent on others, as some would like to be upon them. At the very least, they're not very admirable for making the rest of the population work so hard to prevent them from taking everybody down with them.

:I.e. that  (in my view of the Cpunk position) one :can protect privacy not through morals,  policies or :law, but through technology. I also don't see much success in attempting to protect privacy through the promotion of morals, policies, or laws, either.   However, the list is always engaged in discussing 'privacy rights' as a basis for their own objections to governments' attitudes against the unfettered use of new technologies.  Recognizing that we all live in a context made up of philosophical stands, politics, and legalities, and that as you said, "these are the glitches in discourse we have to face on a list  that's for both technology and policy", it can't seem real to position this aspect completely out of the realm of thought as a non-valid element.  Some people are going to want to think of the applications of technology in moral terms, and in a free society one must make allowances for those kinds of people.   It should be possible to at least think about its proper place, occasionally, without suffering too much from the association.

Well, sure, you can always expect that government employees should have to know about morality, since they've made themselves responsible for things like social welfare and the advancement of Great Societies.
But no one else is required to 'behave' that way  -  they only need to know that they will suffer the consequences of trespassing the lines which divide us. :If all morality is relative, then the only possible way :for people to live together peaceably is for a single  :arbitrary  will and to impose that morality by as much :violence as  necessary  -- this is the classic argument :(Hobbes, Nazis)  for absolutist government.
No one said that morality is or should be relative, nor either that they want to live together peaceably.  They did express their displeasure at having to read anyone's disapproval on particular applications of crypto knowledge.   I myself don't think that being able to evaluate human actions in terms of their propriety is outside the capacities of technogeeks to ponder (don't jump if you don't identify with one).
I agree it is important, especially for those who do expect to live in formal societies, to develop a *conscious knowledge* of morality, of the meaning of human actions in terms of 'right' and 'wrong'.   If we were all properly acquainted with the elements of morality it would be easier to identify its place in the life of real humans who have values and wish to protect them from deliterious, intrusive attacks (from any source).  A conscious knowledge also makes it possible to present valid basis for objecting to the 'evil' which governments will do.   You said, in reference to ye kings of olde, that "many of the actions of the state were unlawful" and that there were those who established that the king could not "make law as he pleased".    Actually, being a conquering ruler gives a king the latitude to make any 'law' that he pleases.   But to free themselves from the king's  grasp, the influential philosophers of the past took their mind to a consideration of what the substance of morality, or  'goodness/badness', means in the life of a human being qua the nature of being human.   What else could be the basis for the desire to act in freedom & liberty from autocratic rule?
Some cpunks don't think it's necessary to indulge in these discussions, but individuals always act within the context of evaluations upon the implications of their actions.  It doesn't go away; it must be dealt with it, especially if what one (publicly) contemplates doing is potentially in conflict with others' high moral standards.

The United States is made up of ignorant people who know what they need to get by in life, and do not want to take the time to do what it takes to improve themselves, ie. vote. As for morality, I feel it is somthing that we all wish to be but find it hard to be. I know I find it hard to be moral.
On the note, I offer this quote which is always amusing to me:
"The only claim made for any organized ideas of human nature is that everybody everywhere needs them in order to tell what is human, what is natural, what is worth knowing, what is worth having and how to get it, and all the other information necessary for getting through the day, week, year and lifetime.   .....That is human nature  -  to organize the data of human nature into a body of knowledge or working model.  That is what a working model or organized idea of human nature does:  it gives you the story about where everything belongs, and how and when and why it belongs there.
And as for people who wear comfortable shoes and assume nothing, they are usually killed very young while trying to cross the street.  Such people have no idea whatsoever about where anything belongs, or how and when and why it belongs there.  That makes it very difficult to stay alive, let alone to locate the real fact.  People who assume nothing have no working model of human nature to begin with and thus no way to assemble even the true story with its moral about what to pay attention to.
So that is how  a working model of human nature works.  It provides you with a frame of meaning and puts you in the picture.  And once you are there, you can see where you stand on such diverse issues as life and death.  You can find your point of view about taxes and clothing.  You can fix your position with regard to the schoolhouse, the alehouse, the whorehouse, the courthouse, and the electric chair.  In other words, a working model of human nature makes things visible, and you visible as well."

Well, reading books like the one from which I took that quote would alert one's attention to the fact that there are many working models of human nature possible, and that one should not merely take the one given out in school or at church or by whomever.  I think that when one realizes that these models are all the product of our own human reasoning, then the idea of liberty & freedom becomes more meaningful, as one realizes that there are choices beyond the views created by one's elders or I think this would start a big fight in the public schools as to which philosophy or sociological works to use in the classroom.  However, in classrooms per se if there were a general presentation of the concepts and discussions on the human ability to develop comprehensive views of the world, then everyone was turned loose in the library, each person could begin their study of any of them and proceed at their own pace & interest.  At the very least they could become aware of the source of the images of human nature which surround us and could better evaluate what it means to live & act within any particular system of operations.
The opportunities for this kind of thinking are greatly limited to what the church and politics provide as a frame of reference  (not that the libraries aren't open and available for budding curiosities).  It was from browsing through picture books of other peoples & reading about how other cultures arrange their existence, that I developed the comprehension that there are different methods of doing things in the world, that there is such a thing as choice, and that not only cultures but individuals can arrange their affairs according to their own ideas of success.

In this case it is as though the demand for personal information & credentials replaces  sensitivity to, & understanding of, human nature.  As services become more automated the opportunity for human contact is diminished, while the need to certify the verity of remote data becomes more critical.  When the information has been centralized, it has the effect of displacing personal responsibility away from the individual up to the State, as the State becomes the official keeper of the data. And how else could the governors be expected to fulfill their obligation of keeping the peace and general welfare, if they cannot gather & keep information on all their remote & moving targets?

All's fair in love and war.  But how many of the voting public does it take to squeeze blood out of a turnip? (i.e. create something from nothing?)  Before the voting public which bands together can coerce a service out of some corporate entity, there must first be a Provider in existence.

"Achieving" social dynamics has the same sound&sense as social engineering:  consciously planning to arrive at a certain kind of social dynamic -  whether a positive kind or a negative one.  . Assessment/recognition of who has the greater influence over the flavor of this social dynamic: the tool or the maker, the designer or the user, the user or the circumstance within which a need arises:
change, for introducing a new element  to the storehouse of tools already available to the social body

"This requires carefully considering sequences of  introduction of various strong crypto tools into society, and predicting  the reactions of society as these tools are introduced."
.  This is useful to calculate if you own an enterprise and are computing the profit which the company might bring in, depending upon the success of the product in the marketplace for cool tools.

With such a potential for failure, the controls implemented would need to be complete -  total - with no allowance for "free radicals".
.  How much can one group really plan on achieving for another group: such attempts at managing a society's acceptance of new elements ever succeeded and been maintained as a constant, steady continuum; endeavor, when success would mean displacing the self-control which the members of that society should be developing over their own decision-making abilities.
. Otherwise, what actions could be recommended, depending on whether the responses were positive, negative, or just neutral?
. The responses from the social body would depend upon:

be to dealing with breaks in the processes; to disturbances in their atmosphere
.  Given the above, if all things went well and social circumstances improved, who would receive the credit;
.  but,   if anything went wrong,  who would be blamed:  the ones who used the fire, or the ones who brought it to them in the first place.
I know:  there would be grass-roots campaigns against fire.

Responding to msg by Jim Hart:
You don't really have a problem with that, do you?  :>)
There are no expectations placed on non-designers to come up with anything of any practical use to society, therefore they have no responsibility or liability, as no one takes them very People who put up blocks to progress and improvement (not merely 'changes' per se) are suffering from a sense of loss of control over their existence, and should be sent to a hospital to recuperate from their psychic wounds.  (Actually, I think that this wouldn't become such a big problem if, for one thing, everyone had a clear understanding & appreciation of the concept of "property", what that constitutes, and what that means in terms of the liberty to affect things in the world around us.)

Sure, Jason  -   whatever gets you through the fight,
                           it's allright,   it's allright. . . . Wait  -  is that Fabio, with the G.E.S.T.A.-- H.E.A.T., dressed in a sleek black turtleneck & carrying a big gun?  But why is he running toward Your house?

Responding to msg by James A. Donald:
comparison to others similarly inclined).
such things.  He's not on the board of directors of the NII, is he; or  how does he exert influence?
they succeed in making themselves influential?
someone (like Chomsky) today or someone else tomorrow.  It should always be possible to recognize the difference between one thing and another - one kind of idea or social system or another - just as you have, by seeing the contradictions and actual relations in the expressed statements, proposals, methodologies, etc.  many people have always found to their advantage to believe, but I can't see where Chomsky is the only & most important reason why they are willing to think as they do.  So -  those are my comments on Chomsky, about which I will write no more, as he doesn't sound interesting at all to pursue.

Acapulco H.E.A.T., with dubious crypto and suspect technology,  has become an inside joke for Cypherpunks. When we watch it, we see things the average person misses.  This is something we share, and something that helps create the lighter side of Cypherpunk culture.
Yeah, Rishab.   What about all that social-cyberspatial-culture philosophy stuff you write.  Surely you see a relation here to the concepts of tribal and cyberspatial society?

@_subject: Cypherpunks meetings in other cities 
Responding to msg by Al Billings:
We had one (which I was at) and there might have been a second. For some reason, there hasn't been any follow-up in the last six or more months to them.
There was a second meeting -  I set it up, sent out several notices, received around 11 replies, then only 4 people showed up (2 were co-workers from MS).  Maybe it's because it was a rare sunny day and everyone decided to go sailing, I don't know, but I decided there was not enough interest for me to continue making all the effort it took to get people to meet.

@_subject: T.A.Z. on Disk 
I just sent this email to Sandy Sandfort,  and he suggested I share it with the list:
I was just at BlockBuster Music store this evening and happened to go by the 'H's in the Rock Music section  -  and saw Hakim Bey's name.  Yes, there is a CD names T.A.Z *.    Blockbuster allows customers to listen to CDs before they buy, so I listened to it.   Hakim actually reads several chapters from his book, and there is odd music at the introduction and in the background while he reads.    He has a very nice, deep, clear I guess you could say this is one of those self-help books-on-tape   -  sort of a "save time & become an anarchist while you drive" CD.
*T.A.Z. = The Autonomous Zone

Bill Gates now has an address for questions  -   askbill at microsoft.com
He has a column which is published every other Wednesday In the local Seattle Post-Intelligencer, where he answers a few of the questions which he finds in that mailbox address.   He says he will not reply to questions personally (only in the column), but you never know  -  a few of you special people could burn his ear and perhaps elicit one to yourself (or perhaps even to the list!)
