The new Freedom 2.0 beta uses a different method for receiving nym
email than in 1.0.
1.0 used remailer reply blocks.  Several separate blocks were set up due
to the unreliability of the remailer network (?).  The Freedom servers
sent mail to all the reply blocks.  The client software was then smart
enough to eliminate the duplicates if more than one came through.
2.0 just runs a POP server at freedom.net.  Then you connect to it via
the anonymous Freedom network, as when you are web browsing or using
IRC anonymously.  You retrieve your mail and you're done.  It seems to
be much more reliable.
Any comments on whether this new approach provides less privacy?
Note that the beta test is using only a few servers, all controlled
by ZKS, and so provides no real anonymity.  That will change once 2.0
is released.

What if you eliminated the anonymity of caller to receiver, and only
tried to achieve traffic analysis resistance.  That is, a receiver can
find out who is calling him, but if the caller and receiver are honest
and desire privacy, a third party cannot find out they are communicating.
Does this allow for a more efficient design?  Can the intermediate switch
nodes now handle delays by inserting dummy traffic, which can only be
recognized as such by the other end (caller or receiver)?

In fact, Browne did better than Buchanan in Florida, and for that
matter Phillips did better than Hagelin.  I too noticed CNN's bizarre
focus on Hagelin over the much higher polling Browne and Phillips.
Perhaps Hagelin acquired an aura of respectability at their editorial
desk due to his fight with Buchanan for the Reform nomination.
Buchanan beat Browne nationwide but Browne won in a number of states,
including Florida.  However Browne's vote total ended up being lower
than in 1996.

Keep in mind that the recent E-Sign bill is not about digital signatures.
It's about electronic signatures.
An electronic signature doesn't necessarily have to have anything to
do with cryptography.  It is simply an electronic means of registering
consent.  This may be as simple as a mouse click, or pressing a button
on your telephone keypad to indicate consent to some charge.
The insecurity of digital signatures pales when we realize how little
security there is in the rest of the world.  Handwritten and electronic
signatures are no more secure than digital ones.
As an aside, the arguments against digital signatures apply to all of
cryptography, and by extension to all of computing.  By these arguments,
we can never trust anything our computers do.  We might as well toss
the whole lot into the trash bin.

In the sense that, in the vast majority of communications, there is no
man in the middle attack being mounted?
Couldn't the same thing be said of cryptography, since in the vast
majority of cases there is no eavesdropping?
The point in both cases is that if you construct a protocol which has
weaknesses, eventually people may begin to exploit them.  Building a
supposedly secure crypto protocol which is weak against a man in the
middle attack is an invitation to trouble.  If you had reason to use
cryptography in the first place, you have reason to fear a man in the
middle attack.  Designing against that threat is not a waste of time,
it is insurance against future troubles.

Are you sure that works?  I would think the SSL client would do a
connection to the URL the user typed,  and check the
name in the cert to see if it (approximately) matches.  If some DNS
redirection is done in the background so that amazon.com gets mapped
to amazon.hackeddomain.com, the client will not be aware of this (will
it?) and so it will still throw up a warning when it sees a cert for
hackeddomain.com on a connection to amazon.com.

Still confused...
The original connection to  is an SSL connection, right?
We are following an https: URL?  (Otherwise, SSL would not even come
into the picture.)
If you do a DNS hack to redirect  to amazon.hackeddomain.com,
the latter site will not be able to complete SSL handshaking without
triggering a browser warning, will it?
Are you suggesting that the server would reply to the SSL handshake
with a NULL transform?  I just checked my browser (Netscape) and it
did not offer NULL as an option.  The only ciphersuites offered in the
client_hello message were:
     V2CipherSpec SSL_RC4_128_WITH_MD5          = { 0x01,0x00,0x80 };
     V2CipherSpec SSL_RC4_128_EXPORT40_WITH_MD5 = { 0x02,0x00,0x80 };
     V2CipherSpec SSL_RC2_CBC_128_CBC_WITH_MD5  = { 0x03,0x00,0x80 };
     V2CipherSpec SSL_RC2_CBC_128_CBC_EXPORT40_WITH_MD5 = { 0x04,0x00,0x80 };
     V2CipherSpec SSL_IDEA_128_CBC_WITH_MD5     = { 0x05,0x00,0x80 };
     V2CipherSpec SSL_DES_192_EDE3_CBC_WITH_MD5 = { 0x07,0x00,0xC0 };
The server must choose from this list, and all of these require the
server to respond with an RSA certificate.
So it looks to me like the SSL protocol will not allow the redirection
attack to work without triggering a user alert, unless there is some
subtlety here...

@_subject: CDR: Re: ZKS -- the path to world domination 
What about adding link padding?  Can you say something about why
this doesn't help, or costs too much?
Without it, someone monitoring your system can see which ZKS node you are
talking to.  If they then monitor that node they can see that whenever
you send an incoming message, there comes an outgoing message, so they
can see the next node you are talking to, and so on.
With link padding, they couldn't do this.  They'd have to interrupt
your data stream and then monitor *all* the outgoing traffic from *all*
the ZKS nodes and see which one got interrupted.  This sounds like a
much more expensive attack.  It is an active attack as well, while the
previous one is passive and could be done by a Carnivore system.
