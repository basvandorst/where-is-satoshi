@_subject: Domestic ftp sites 
I've just started an ftp site with a USA/Canada distribution policy for
crypto software.  Nothing can totally prevent the theft of data from
this site, or ripem.msu.edu or rsa.com, but I decided that I would
exercise my right to publish within the USA anyway.  About the best
I can do without demanding to see proof of citizenship in person (and
even that could be forged) is to make it very difficult to get the data
without reading a warning notice first, and hope that a combination of
conscience along with the possibility of the actions being traced by
the U. S. Government and/or the government of the perpetrator's country will limit the number of violations.
anonymous ftp to csn.org and read mpj/README.MPJ for details.  There
is also the Colorado Catacombs BBS (303-938-9654) crypto areas that I
hope to expand.

@_subject: MPJ2 Encryption Algorithm 
For a sneak preview of the MPJ2 Encryption Algorithm article I just submitted
to the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, anonymous ftp to csn.org and
look in the mpj directory or call my BBS at 303-938-9654.  I used the same mechanism used by rsa.com to isolate the nonexportable stuff (source code, programs) from the Constitutionally protected publication (article describing the algorithm).  Seems strange to me, but if it works for the Department of State and rsa.com thinks it won't get them in trouble, then I guess I'm not sticking my neck out too far.
Any technical types among you want to take a look at the algorithm and tell me what you think about its security?  I've been trying to break it for
several years, but I'm just an amateur who reads a lot.
Why MPJ2 and not just IDEA or 3DES?  Never put all your crypto eggs in one basket.  Besides, MPJ2 is royalty-free.  Go build some useful code or hardware.  (MPJ2 is faster and simpler in hardware, once the key is set up).

Duane Thompson tells me that cookies will be served starting at 6:30pm,
so the early comers get more than the good seats.  :-)
I'm not sure if I'm REALLY a crypto expert, but I plan to be there.  :-)

@_subject: More 40-bit RC4 nonsense 
Why did the NSA require that an application using the Sapphire Stream Cipher
be limited to a _32-bit_ session key instead of the well-known _40-bit_
limit for RC4?  I wonder if there are other key bit leaks that cover the other

Sorry, I fumbled reception of the pgptools.zip update... tried an mv to a

will be delayed while I wait for retransmission via some slow remailers.

So, is soda still the archive (have I missed a major announcement?)?
 Is there a later version of pgptools?
Try csn.org:/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/pgp_tools
See csn.org:/mpj/README.MPJ for the ???????  Is there an approved of pool or newsgroup to send messages to Pr0duct
Cypher? I hate to add to the cypherpunks traffic with comments directly
to him/her. (We NEED to get the return addresses working, or Pr0duct

@_subject: MacPGP is at csn.org.  See /mpj/README.MPJ 
Can anyone give me a FTP site where MacPGP is available.  i think the Ratings idea is brilliant.
MacPGP is at nic.funet.fi and csn.org:/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/pgp
(see /mpj/README.MPJ for export restrictions and the real characters to go in
place of ???????).
MacPGP is also on the Colorado Catacombs BBS (303-938-9654).

I think csn.org must have been down for a few minutes when you first tried.
In any case, Curve Encrypt 1.0 is now posted at csn.org.  Read

@_subject: RSA IS the weak link in PGP 
This is true.  To equal the strength of a 128 bit IDEA key, the RSA key would
have to be about 3,000 bits long.  This is because EVERY 128 bit number (except
maybe a small number of weak keys) is a good IDEA key, but only specially selected large numbers work well for RSA keys.  Of course, I'm not really
concerned that you will factor my 1024 bit RSA modulus by tomorrow morning :).

@_subject: 4th ammendment and cryptography 
I didn't say much on the 4th ammendment, but did mention it
in csn.org:/mpj/cryptusa.*
My main argument was that the ITAR violates the 1st ammendment.
By the way, the above mentioned ftp site has an "export controlled"
area for crypto software and information.  Don't let lack of a
distribution point stop you from writing crypto software.  Send
me some mail if you are interested in distributing a quality,
strong crypto program in the USA.                              Mike Johson

@_subject: Gore's "new and improved" key escrow proposal 
Just think how easy it would be to comply with software key escrow requirements:
imagine a new PGP option -- +encrypt_to_escrow_agents=on
The escrow agent's PGP public key could be shipped with every copy of PGP...
naturally, every PGP user will be required by law not to override this
option if the Vice President gets his way.
 --- sound of tongue being removed from cheek ---
I have tried to think of a positive use for key escrow.  The only  thing that I
have come up with so far is kind of like having local key escrow within one company, or something like that.  Kind of like having a master key that fits
all the offices in one wing of a building, or something like that.  That could
be good in some business uses, provided you could pick your own trusted master
key holder.  I don't think that is what Al Gore has in mind.

@_subject: Export of "Top Secret Data Encryption Techniques" 
I was curious about that, too, but found out that the NSA declared it to
be exportable.  Note that there is no requirement that exportable crypto
be marked as such.  I've looked at the stuff in the book, and determined
that I could probably crack most of it if I cared enough and had a fast
computer.  I also found that the author made a mistake in implementation
that could cause some messages to not decrypt even if you have the right
key, if you have a different brand of math coprocessor than the sender
had.                    ___________________________________________________________

OOPS -- I must have prematurely deleted something.  I still have it on
the Colorado Catacombs BBS (303-938-9654), and I'll put it back up
on csn.org within a day or so.  I thought I merged the new with the old
