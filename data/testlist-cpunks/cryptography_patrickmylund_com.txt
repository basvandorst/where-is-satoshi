Just so people on this list are aware, James is either trolling or really
hated Aaron for some reason. Earlier this year on the randombit crypto
mailing list, he stated that it was a good thing Aaron killed himself
seeing as he "needed killing."

Even if they start mentioning this little detail, their implementation
would still be horribly broken: ECB mode without authentication, no RSA
padding, poor random numbers, and code like this:
    try:
        raise ImportError()
        from Crypto.Random.random import StrongRandom
    except ImportError:
        from random import Random as StrongRandom
The list goes on:
Tribler is the Telegram of torrent clients. Stay far away from it.

History is littered with people who did remarkable things only to abuse the
trust people placed in them to do horrible things. Writing some cool ECC
crypto code does not preclude you from criticism when you show yourself to
be someone who fantasizes about killing people. (Just look at all the
creative ways he killed off people in the last thread! There was way too
much imagination involved to be channeling anyone.)
James already proved himself a racist earlier in the discussion when he
mentioned that he could only find "a number of black felons who should have
been killed off long ago" while googling a person's name. "Black" was, of
course, completely irrelevant, but he nevertheless found it important to
If you're puzzled as to why he acts this way, his website might shine a
little light on the issue: Clearly, the best solution is to ignore him. But let's not try to excuse
what could best be described as the musings of a bitter old man because he
wrote some code a decade ago.

Well, my point was that it doesn't matter what you've contributed--it
doesn't give you carte blanche to say whatever you want and somehow not be
deserving of a reaction.
"Racism doesn't matter": I don't know how to respond to that.
Then again, I'm not trying to rationalize why people deserve to die.
In any case, I'm not interested in turning this into a pissing contest.

You should spend some of that energy on learning not to top-post.

Very sobering to see sanity almost across the board, and I at least was
surprised that there are people with computer science degrees in Congress!

All that text and I still have no idea what this thing does. The exercise
is pointless: I could give you some plaintext and blob of random garbage
(or just use a one-time pad) and make all the same claims. And the
customers listed on their Customers page are using their Remote Desktop
product, not this.
But all you really need to know is they're only offering $1,000 as a reward
to people who break their
provably-secure-everybody-else-is-an-idiot-yadda-yadda system. Maybe they
should convince themselves that it's secure first.
