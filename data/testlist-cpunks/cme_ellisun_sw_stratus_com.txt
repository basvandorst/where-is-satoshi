OK -- here's my replies for the list.
I believe key registration is the *whole point* of the Skipjack proposal.
This is the first time in the history of cryptography, as far as I can
tell, when a government has tried to interfere with the private citizenry's
ability to use strong cryptography -- and they're doing it strictly through
key registration.
However, being clever folks, they have added a strawman to the proposal.
They proposed an NSA-designed algorithm -- something people would fight in
such a way that the government could hopefully turn around and call the
opponents paranoid and get the public to believe the gov't, writing off the
Look back at the original announcement.
The gov't said, in effect, 'if you don't like to use NSA's algorithm, you're
free to design algorithms of your own provided they permit key escrow.'
Then they left that as a note -- an aside -- and proceeded to take on all
comers w.r.t. the Skipjack algorithm.
I say:  don't fight their strength, even if it's flawed.  It's a tar
baby at best.
We should fight the only thing which matters:  key registration.
What's important about key registration, to me, isn't the details.  It's
the philosophy.  This is the first time in the history of the world that
the government has laid any claim at all to a citizen's cryptographic

I am one person who believes that the gov't would never be able to
establish a key escrow agency secure enough even for my customers (Stratus
customers: already extra-careful purchasers of high priced fault tolerant
equipment: banks, large funds transfer people, stock brokers, hospitals,
...).  It's too cheap for organized crime to bribe or break in at the
escrow agencies.  Therefore, I'm on record as a commercial crypto
consultant recommending against any customer of ours using any escrowed-key
mechanism, no matter how strong the algorithm or how trustworthy the
key generation process.
If the agency is too flaky for me, they're bound to be too flaky to be
trusted with a paper trail of NSA's eavesdropping targets.  The traffic
analysis of that trail would be worth an absolute fortune.  I'd give it a
week before it was compromised.
So:  I wouldn't go to the escrow agencies in any way at all.
Now, there was an interesting thing from DERD the other day -- that the
original key generation mechanism is out, replaced by one which is
classified (for nat'l security reasons, I assume).

[triple-DES | permute larger block | IDEA]
For some time, I've been advocating (over in sci.crypt)
instead of normal triple DES.  tran is not an encryption algorithm so it's
been posted worldwide several times and is available from me by mail or on
a few ftp sites.  It does a pseudo-random transposition of a variable
length block (up to 8KB) -- using the sum of bytes in the first block as
the key to the PRNG.  [That could be better and I'm planning to do an
improvement -- using the histogram of the bytes of the first block as a
much larger key to the PRNG.]  tran is a self-inverse.
This dosen't guarantee bit diffusion -- but does diffuse the probability of
change (of a single output bit, given a changed single input bit) evenly
over a big block.
For operation within a single chip, I'd advocate yours rather than this
Of course, one could also do (for S/W solutions):
There's no reason for pipelined operations like yours or mine to be slower
than a single cipher.  The pipelines need to be kept full.  That means
that you feed the chip data with one set of handshaking and take data from
it with another set.  You don't treat the chip like an RPC.  As long as
you think UNIX pipes, it will make sense.

I did a version of tran which did 4 rounds of an FFT-style butterfly.
This achieves maximal mixing.  However, it's predictable -- therefore
easier to cryptanalyze (not that I'd care to try it :-).
DES does a fine job of bit diffusion, within its block.  (for CBC, that
includes the rest of the stream -- if you hide the ciphertext from the
cryptanalyst, so he can't XOR it out again)
tran moves bytes of DES output around so that they can expect to have
new neighbors for the next round of encryption.  This produces diffusion.
The actual diffusion of tran is less than that of the FFT-butterfly.
However, for the cryptanalyst, there are more possibilities.  Any byte
can go anywhere within the 8KB block.  With the FFT, each byte goes to
a known location and gets diffused with 7 neighbors by the next round of

The problem I see for finding spikes is that this is still a brute force
approach.  The advantage that biological populations have is in growing
new test processors exponentially, so that there is a chance to
attack something which is merely exponential.
An algorithm or breaking method which helps against modern cryptosystems
would have to turn the spikes into gentle hills by some sort of mapping of
the problem space.  Biological attack machines would still run up against
limits (e.g., the amoung of carbon in the solar system), so we have to spread
the spikes.  In fact, we have to spread them over the whole space since
enlargement of the key space can take a gentle but limited-width hill
and make it look/act like a spike.

Call for Participation
The POSIX security working group will be concentrating on several
new areas of security functionality at the October 18 meeting in
Bethesda, Maryland.  The group believes that these areas must be completed
in order for the defined interfaces in P1003.6.1 and P1003.6.2 to be
fully useful.  These new areas include:
          Identification and Authentication Services
          Portable Data Formats
          Cryptographic Services
          Administrative Services
                    Identification and Authentication Services
POSIX 1003.1 and 1003.2 provide little functionality in the areas of
identification and authentication.  The security working group believes
that services for identifying users and authenticating those identities is
essential for protecting resources within a system. One proposal, from
ICL, has been received to date on this subject.  It will be distributed
in the POSIX mailing and will be discussed at the October meeting.  In
addition, distributed issues of identification and authentication will
be discussed so that a resulting standard will accommodate distributed
identification and authentication technology. Any additional proposals
for identification and authentication services will also be entertained.
                    Portable Data Formats
POSIX 1003.6.1 has defined several interfaces to create and manipulate
security-related data items - access control lists, labels, capabilities,
and audit records. However, the data items are not described to the level
of detail necessary to use them in a portable way.  For true application
portability the format of these data items must be known.  One proposal
has been received, from Haystack Laboratories, for a common audit trail
interchange format. This proposal will be included in the POSIX mailing
and will be discussed at the October meeting. Any additional proposals
for portable data formats will also be entertained.
                    Cryptographic Services
One proposal has been received, form NIST, which outlines interfaces for
several areas of cryptographic services: user cryptographic database
management, secret key cryptography services,  and public key cryptography
services.  The secret key services include encryption and data integrity,
as well as key management. The public key services include encryption
and digital signatures, as well as key management. The proposal will
be included in the POSIX mailing and will be discussed at the October meeting.
Another proposal may be submitted by the October meeting and will also
be discussed.  Any additional proposals for crytpographic services will
also be entertained.
                    Administrative Services
The security working group met with the administrative services working
group (P1003.7) to discuss what interfaces and utilities need to be defined
to provide portable application writers with a standard method for
administering security-related data items. The original scope of P1003.6
excluded this functionality because P1003.1 and P1003.2 excluded this
functionality.  However, these utilites and functions are essential for
application writers to provide truly portable applications. Any proposals
in this areas are encouraged and will be discussed at the October meeting.
Proposals in these, or other, security-related areas are welcome and can be
mailed to the chair for enclosure in the POSIX mailing and the agenda for
the meeting.  This will allow members of the working group to review the
proposal and be prepared for discussion at the meeting.  Proposals will
also be accepted at the meeting, but only in written form.  This makes it
more likely that a proposal has been thought out and keeps discussion
focused on a tangible document.
In order to plan for the agenda for the working group meeting, please
forward your name, email address, area of interest, and expected duration that you will be at the Bethesda meeting. Addresses for the chair are listed
below.  The hope is that a large group will be available for discussion all
week, but sometimes that is not quite reality. If you can only attend a few days, or would like to present something on a
specific day, please provide that inforamtion and the agenda will be created accordingly.
Questions and written proposals can be sent to the chair in any of the
following ways:

AFAIK, the only way to do this is with a Vernam OTP.  You have a key file (A)

Then you take an innocent text (D) and XOR with (C) to get an alleged key

and put up just enough resistence in letting folks have (E).
Does anyone know a simpler way?  I'm willing to bet that it can be proved that
the key would have to be at least 1/8 the length of the message in order for
this to work but I don't know of any schemes using less than the message

Yup -- I was assuming no padding.
If you allow padding, I already have a secret-key cipher which uses random
padding in order to frustrate known-plaintext attacks.  My favorite method
uses a key to initialize a PRNG whose output gives the number of bytes of
each stream to put in the output stream -- then encipher the PRNG key
followed by the multiplexed stream.  One of the streams being multiplexed
(and there can be a huge number, if you're encrypting an archive, for
example) can and should be random -- so that if you make a small change
and re-encrypt, you don't end up with cribs.
For this purpose, you'd need to have several files hanging around your
machine of random numbers yet to be used for padding.
Meanwhile, I have several files of random numbers which I keep around for
running simulations.
My favorite random number generator is
where the idea keys are chosen randomly and there's no mic plugged in

@_subject: academician seeks critique of cryptographic paper 
This reminds me of what I had to go through to get approved to get married
in the Roman Catholic Church.  I ended up having to say, for the record, "I
have no intention of using mechanical methods of birth control"
(pre-safe-sex days) when what they wanted was for me to say I would avoid
all birth control.
I'm now ashamed I stooped to that non-confrontive statement (especially
since the marriage didn't last :-).  I should have said, "No, I don't
accept your view of birth control and have every intention of using it."
At least I did say that my fiancee was on the pill and we intended to
continue using it.
I would be happy to review your paper and to suggest others who might
be good reviewers.  Furthermore, I have no intention of violating the
export laws (even though I disagree with them and work very hard to
change them).
However, I do not grant the NSA the power to control the publication of
theoretical information.  I have published papers on cryptology in the
international press, without offering the NSA the chance to review what I
write ahead of time, and I intend to continue doing so.  They have their
internal publications, no doubt, and we have our public ones.  I don't tell
them what to publish internally and I will not allow them to tell me what I
can publish out here in the public.
That is my policy, for my own writing.
If you send me your paper to review, I will not disseminate it.  That's
a matter of respecting your wishes -- not the NSA's.  My acceptance of
your paper will not constitute any agreement on my part to give the NSA
control over publications of ideas.

\title{MTTF of Various Systems}
\author{Carl M. Ellison \thanks{Stratus Computer Inc., 55 Fairbanks Blvd.,

\date{October 25, 1993}
Expressions are presented for the Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) of various
redundant systems, as a function of the number of nodes in the system, N,
and the minimum number of nodes in a working system, K.  Failure of a
system is defined as having fewer than K working nodes.
\section{Expressions} Redundant systems are employed both to increase availability and to achieve
preservation of data.
Expressions for the availability of a redundant system are to be found in
normal probability and statistics texts.  [See for example, Kishor S.
Trivedi, "Probability and Statistics with Reliability, Queuing, and
Computer Science Applications" from Prentice-Hall, 1982.]  These assume
that once a system has recovered from total failure, it is as usable as it
was before the system failure.
Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) is concerned with the case that once a system
has achieved total failure, something is lost.  This might apply to
redundant disks, for example.
The expressions presented below are for the MTTF of various redundant
systems, as a function of the number of nodes in the system, N, and the
minimum number of nodes in a working system, K.  Failure of a system is
defined as having fewer than K working nodes.  Often, K=1 and each node has
a complete copy of each database.  However, sometimes the data can be kept
on multple nodes (as in a RAID-5 disk array) which will tolerate some
failures, down to a given threshold, K > 1.
It is assumed that as soon as a failure occurs, a repair cycle will be
started.  There is then a race to see if the repair can be completed before
enough additional nodes fail to drop the working number below K.
The expressions below were derived from custom Markov chains, each built to
model a given choice of N and K.  It is assumed that both failures and
repairs are exponentially distributed random events (so that the Markov
chains remain memoryless).  This is a reasonable model for failures but
not for repairs.  Therefore, these expressions are approximations.
The expressions also assume that all failure events are independent.  For
example, a multi-node system in which all nodes are on the same power grid
would not have completely independent failure events.
N: number of nodes in a full system
K: number of nodes in a minimally functional system
$\lambda$: rate of failures (e.g., number of node failures per year)
$\mu$: rate of node repair (in the same units as $\lambda$)
Each fraction below is the MTTF of the whole system: the mean time until a
system drops to (K-1) working nodes.
N =  2 ;  K =  1
\frac { 3\lambda + 1\mu }{ 2\lambda^2 }
N =  3 ;  K =  1
\frac { 11\lambda^2 + 4\lambda\mu + 1\mu^2 }{ 6\lambda^3 }
N =  3 ;  K =  2
\frac{ 5\lambda + \mu }{ 6\lambda^2 }
N =  4 ;  K =  1
\frac { 50\lambda^3 + 18\lambda^2\mu + 5\lambda\mu^2 + 1\mu^3 }{ 24\lambda^4 }

..for the end of the MTTF paper document --------
 - Carl
Let $\lambda = 0.5$ failures/year, assuming a node fails on the average
once every two years.  Let $\mu = 52.0$ repairs/year, assuming a node can
be repaired in a week.  These assumptions result in the following system
MTTF values, in units of years:
\begin{tabular}{||r|r||r||} \hline
$N$ & $K$ & MTTF \\ \hline
2 & 1 & 107.00 \\
3 & 1 & 3747.67 \\
3 & 2 & 36.33 \\
4 & 1 & 98405.50 \\
4 & 2 & 955.50 \\
4 & 3 & 18.50 \\ \hline
If $\lambda = 0.5$ failures/year and $\mu = 350.0$ repairs/year (to follow
the Stratus practice) we get the following system MTTF values, in units of
\begin{tabular}{||r|r||r||} \hline
$N$ & $K$ & MTTF \\ \hline
2 & 1 & 703.00 \\
3 & 1 & 164270.33 \\
3 & 2 & 235.00 \\
4 & 1 & 28788554.16 \\
4 & 2 & 41185.50 \\
4 & 3 & 117.83 \\ \hline
One could also consider the MTTF of a posting on USENET News.  $\lambda$
and $\mu$ might be the same as above, but $N$ is the number of News servers
to which the posting has propagated and $K$ is 1.  The underlying model is
different because it must take account of limited connectivity of News
servers, but it is clear that a posting's MTTF becomes effectively infinite
once it has left its home node.

1.	those of us who advocate privacy in private hands
2.	those who advocate anarchy
I'm in the privacy camp and worry that enough talk from the anarchists
will cause the privacy to be attacked.  I fully expect total retaliation
by the governments of the world against any effective anarchy.  The wilder
the threats (even if they're not real), the stronger the retaliation.
We could lose all privacy as a result.
It's important not to give the government any excuse which would make the
populace side with them against us.  This is a political battle and we need
the people on our side.
For example, crypto-anarchic banks -- cute idea -- but if you ever want a
cop to make your banker give you the money, the banker can't be anonymous
and neither can you account be.  ..so you have to *really* trust this
banker.  Maybe some people will trust such a banker enough.  But,
meanwhile, talk of total tax evasion by the more excited of our

IMNSHO, whether they're inseperable or not, harping on anarchy is like
advocating strong crypto so that terrorists can use it, ignoring all
legitimate uses.  It's the talk which plays into FBI hands, not the
reality.  The reality is here and can not be avoided but reality can't be
cited in PR campaigns the way talk can.
I know that drug dealers, terrorists and child molestors will use strong
crypto.  That doesn't mean that I cite such uses when I write letters to
Congress or to magazine editors.  I cite legitimate uses which the general
public will applaud -- not the abberant uses which can not be avoided, no
matter how draconian the legislation against crypto.
It might be satisfying to point out to the government that they can't stop
anarchists and criminals from using crypto but IMHO that would merely
(1) anger them and (2) give them ammo for denying ligitimate users
access to crypto.  It might even be that that's what they want all along

..and I've just mailed them my comments for this round, yet to show up
in this directory.

Single DES is weak, for a known plaintext attack.  I think we knew that.
We didn't know how weak.
We can extrapolate to an NSA machine with 1 second scan of all keys,
So -- 1.	use triple DES
2.	before using DES, XOR with a stream from a decent PRNG (destroying
3.	in between DES operations, mix bytes up as with	tran (posted on

@_subject: Clipper specifics 
I'd be surprised if they allow you a month or two for more comments.
My current fantasy about Clipper is that the NSA did a deal with AT&T,
demanding removal of DES chips in favor of Skipjack, getting AT&T to buy
into a limited delay in product introduction with the gov't promising to
get the Skipjack standard in place by Summer so that the AT&T phones
weren't held up too long.
That's all out of my own head, but it hangs together.
Does anyone know specifics about AT&T's prior plans?  Was there
a DES version?

des | tran is exactly as secure as des.  A final tran adds nothing.  It
looks messed up to a human, but there's no cryptographic value added.
tran is of value *only* between two strong ciphers and its only value is to
increase the size of the block affected by the surrounding ciphers.
Try the new tran. The one originally posted had a slow (LC) PRNG.
The new one uses subtract-with-borrow and it's faster.
Another consumer warning:  the s-w-b PRNG has a huge period but that doesn't
make it cryptographically secure.  If anything, this is probably the easiest
PRNG to break.

I still have my copy of (what I call) pgp-ran.  I forgot what it was
called when it was posted and I can't find the sources now.
It puts rannos in PGP format.  Does a copy of the sources exist on one
of the servers?
It's too fast to be doing any encryption but it would be good to have
one which produces messages PGP recognizes as real, only for a public
key which isn't on file.  If PGP rejects a message, it wouldn't take
up any Cray cracking time.

This can't be true.
I read DERD's paper on wiretap law and she certainly didn't mention
anything like this.
You must be making it up.
:-) ?
No,  :-(
