You seem to have 2 different questions.
You might consider proxy cryptography here.
Assuming RSA and IPv4 you are only planning to fix 32 bits (perhaps the
next to least significant because you want to cater for even numbered
IP addresses) out of each prime of size 512 or 1024 or whatever.  That does
not sound like much reduced security.
I think so.  Hard cheese for DCHP users though.
Sorry to take issue with Bram again but this reminds me of
    As far as we know, our computer has never had an undetected error.
