@_subject: TOR in Java? 
I think your idea is a fine one for somebody's spare time; we always
need more implementations for the Tor protocol, and Java is a popular
choice these days.  You might want to start with the code from the
Java Anon Proxy people; I don't know their current status here, but
for a while, they had a working Tor *client* written in Java.  Of
course, a server is significantly more complicated, so there would be
a lot more work.
As for the performance issue: you are completely wrong about Tor
servers not needing CPU; at reasonable bandwidth, the requirements are
high.  Fortunately, most of the CPU is used for AES, DH, and RSA, all
of which any sane implementation will implement in native code, so one
might stand a chance of having a compatible implementation of the Tor
protocol written in a less performance critical language.
In other words:  if you want to clone Tor in Java, feel free!  We look
forward to your work.
Note, however, that I keep talking about "compatible implementations"
here.  Tor is 49 thousand lines right now[1], and we're trying to
strengthen incrementally it all the time.  Throwing out the
implementation that we've been working on for the last four years and
starting again from scratch is not likely to work for us.
As for the rest of this thread: language choice is a classical
bike-shed problem[2].  Please, tread lightly, and consider whether
what you're saying needs to be said.  If you're worried about Java:
there's no risk we'll switch the main Tor implementation to it in the
foreseeable future.  If you want Java: great, get some programmers
together and bang out an implementation.
[1] Tor has about 37.6 klines of code, and 11.4 klines of comments.

Hashcash is often considered, but commonly dismissed, because it
limits identities based on the wrong resource: computers.
If you haven't read the paper "'Proof-of-work' Proves Not To Work" by
Ben Laurie and Richard Clayton, I recommend it highly.  See
 .  It mostly
discusses why hashcash can't prevent spam, but the arguments would
seem to apply to wikipedia editing as well.

Sorry, but you've stumbled a personal crusade of mine.
The word is pseudonymous, not pseudo-anonymous.  And the difference is
importatant.  "Pseudonymous" means "using false names," like calling
yourself Batman instead of Bruce Wayne.  "Anonymous" means "without a
name," like writing "The Joker will pay for his crimes" and not
signing it.  "Pseudo-anonymous" isn't a real word, but if it were, it
would mean "falsely anonymous", like the bank robber who disguised
himself by wearing a motorcycle helmet with his name written on the
As one of the designers, I'd like to weigh in.  Tor provides
anonymity, but we've never opposed people who wanted to use an
anonymous system to bootstrap per-service or cross-service
We will never, of course, alter Tor to make people have pseudonyms.
But letting using pseudonyms is not against our overarching goals.
The overarching goals are privacy and usability.{2}
I don't see any iterable (that is, awful) partitioning attacks here.
Assume a network where some users have pseudonyms and some don't.
Assume that pseudonyms are first obtained through a blinded{3}
process, so that an attacker can't tell which user has which
Assume that the attacker is watching all authentication services
(since this is probably the best point for these attacks).  The
attacker could tell when users create new pseudonyms, and when
pseudonymous users are active.  From this info, the attacker could
rule out some users as possible owners of some pseudonyms, but that's
about it.  Correlation and intersection attacks are unlikely to work
unless the attacker is watching the user as well as the auth server,
and that's outside our threat model.
Right.  I suspect that this is one of those social engineering
problems that we won't solve except by trying things out and seeing
whether they work.
{1} There are all other kinds of great terms in the field.  For
    example, "allonymous" is using a name belonging to someone else,
    like if the Joker writes a letter and signs it "Batman."  Oddly,
    there is no classical term for using one's given name.
{2} If you care about privacy and not usability, I recommend DC nets.
    If you care about usability and not privacy, I recommend turning
    Tor off.

Hi again, Jimmy!
 [...]
I think I've identified one of the reasons some people here are disturbed
about your suggestions.  When you talk about changing the Tor
architecture, they think you mean changes to Tor that would require
all users to have pseudonyms, or ostracize the users who didn't.  When
you say "Tor should do X," they think you mean "the Tor software
should do X".{1}
If that were what you meant, they would be right to be concerned.
Pseudonymity is wrong for many users.  Complicating the core Tor
implementation would be bad.
But these aren't your goals, if I understand correctly.  Wikipedia
doesn't ultimately care how Tor is implemented, or what it contains,
so long as it is significantly less effective as a tool for Wikipedia
abuse.  Yes?
This could be achieved, as some people fear, through modifying the
core of Tor.  But that isn't the only way to change matters.  As
discussed, introducing a separate pseudonymous authentication service
(perhaps even an anonymous credential service, if we can find a way to
do this without patent infringement) would serve just as well, and
require no modifications to the Tor code.  Users who didn't want to
use such a service would be no worse off than they are today.  Users
who wanted to use Tor and edit Wikipedia at the same time could decide
whether the implications of such a service were acceptable to them.
{1} To be clear, I think that it's more accurate to talk about changes
    to the User/Tor/Wikipedia interaction, and to suggest a need for
    action by the Tor project and its supporters, than to talk about a
    need for changes in Tor's architecture, and a need for action by
    Tor.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Using Mixminion trough the Tor network 
You'd probably want to hack up Mixminion's socket.connect stuff to use
a SOCKS-compatible version instead.  The functions to hack on the
client side would be in lib/mixminion/MMTPClient.py ; that's the part
that does the client-side network connections.
Unfortunately, Mixminion isn't maintained these days; if anybody is
interested in new versions coming out, they should subscribe to the
mixminion-dev list and coordinate with others.
