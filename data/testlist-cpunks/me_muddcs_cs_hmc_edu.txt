@_subject: software with "hooks" for crypto 
Hello all,
I'm trying to figure out exactly what the laws are regarding the export of
software which contains "hooks" for PGP.  In various forms, I've heard
that it's not the ITAR which prevents this, but more a "suggestion" by
the NSA that we "shouldn't do it."  Does anyone have any pointers to
real legislation/laws regarding this?
Also, since we all know that our gov't thinks it perfectly legal to export
source code in hardcopy form (albeit with a license, right?) I was wondering...
I've written a Unix e-mail client which contains support for PGP/MIME and
also a front end for mixmaster.  Right now I basically reap all the "bad"
code before I distribute it (at _least_ 50% of my testers are outside the
US).  However, this has been annoying for those users because they want
to be able to use the PGP support (so do I!).  So, what I'm wondering is
what the laws are regarding snail-mailing source code to these people.
The actually pgp/remailer stuff isn't more than a few pages of code, which
could easily be transcribed or scanned in with OCR software.  Would I
have to get a "license for export" in order to send the code outside the
It's worth the $1.00 it would cost to do this if it really is legal...

@_subject: Scientologists may subpoena anonymous remailer records 
This is a very good reason to use one of the "alpha" pseudonym servers.
These remailers in turn use other remailers to return the reply to
the owner of the alias (crypted, of course).  In this way, the server
is operating in double-blind mode.
However, the scariest thing about this is that the CoS was able to coerce
the gov't in a foreign nation to get access to anon remailers.  US
remailers have always been suspect for just this reason, and I wait
with bated breath to see whether or not the subpoena is issued.  But if
chaning outside the US won't even work, then the remailers aren't going
to do a whole lot of good.
I've heard several people make this statement...  Can anyone confirm that
it is really possible to log the uid (username) of the person making the
http request?  I know they can get your ip address, but I'm skeptical
of getting the username.

This is true.  We definitely could use more remailers outside the US.
Especially since we all know that if you have enough money, you can
get away with murd^H^H^H^Hanything in this country,possibly even getting
access to remailer records.
Some of the cypherpunk remailers already sort of do this.  However, the only
thing it really does is make it a little harder to do traffic analysis.
The main problem with your scheme is that all of the remailers would have
access to the final destination of the message.  The best method is still
to use a randomly selected group of remailers for each anonymous message,
and change your reply block on your nym often.

@_subject: Lack of PGP signatures 
He was talking about signing messages that you send.  You have to enter your
passphrase possible over a TELNET session, which sends it across in the
clear.  This is a Bad Thing(tm) for keeping it truly private.

Did it move?  I hadn't seen any announcement of this...

This does not make sense...  If you believe that RSA has a back door, then
PGP _must_ have a back door because PGP uses it!  It does not matter if
it was independently coded and reviewed.  There could still be a back door
if it was made that way intentionally.
