@_subject: [tor-talk] IP Cloaking and the CFAA [Was: Appearing American] 
I just ran a quick scan through my mail archives and didn't see this story
mentioned.  (If it has, apologies for the dup - it was not a thorough scan)
IP Cloaking Violates Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, Judge Rules
"A federal judge has ruled that circumventing an IP address blockade to
connect to a website is a breach of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the
same law that was used to prosecute Aaron Swartzbefore he committed suicide
earlier this year."
