@_subject: Secure mail relays [was:RE: DOJ proposes US data-rentention law. 
We run the main MTA for my university this way (of course it will relay
without authentication if the client source address is within the
university IP ranges), using sendmail and cyrus-sasl.  It's my impression
that many US universities are starting to do this.  We started it as a
one-off MTA handling submission of mail for travelers, then realized that
the regular MTA could just provide this service.  It also does Kerberos
authentication, which I use (though not many MUAs support it).
The obvious port is 587, the "submission" port (see RFC 2476), which in
fact is the one that MUAs "should" use, rather than 25 (we support it, I'm
submitting this mail using it, via my home ISP).  Of course if it actually
becomes popular those misguided ISPs will block it too ...

I have seen "private" and "secret" defined in exactly the opposite fashion
as regards keys:  a "private" key is private because you never ever share
it with anyone, whereas a "secret" (symmetric) key is a secret because
you've told someone else and you expect them to not share it (in the sense
of "can you keep a secret?").
Clearly there's not a common understanding of these simple words.  Seems
to me that Dan's mini-rant was referring to "privacy" in the sense you
define it above (controlling spread of info already held by others).
