First of all, what does this have to do with crypto..
Apparently this is your (presently unsubstantiated) opinion.  How about
some references that don't involve ATF employee testimonys?
In many places, spanking a child (with restraint and compassion, as a
parent) is considered child abuse, so I suppose this statement could be
considered true.
I am not alone, however, in my belief that corporal punishment is sometimes
a necessary part of parenting.
While I don't share the Davidians religious beliefs, I'd like to see more
evidence that the ATF was justified in their assault.
I'm not yet convinced.

The folks in Waco hadn't committed any great crime, and would have
continued in their secluded existence for quite some time had the ATF not
seen fit to provide a catalyst.
I suppose that cyberspace, with its potential anonymity and privacy, would
be the stuff ATF nightmares are made of..  NO DOORS TO KICK DOWN, and GUNS
are PRETTY USELESS in CYBERSPACE!! :-)
