Reba will join Rosie O'Donnell as her special co-host February 16, as The Rosie O'Donnell Show continues its broadcasts from Los Angeles.  In addition to pulling co-hosting duties, Reba will also perform "What If," her tribute song to the Salvation Army. Fresh off her wins at both the Peoples Choice Awards (which she hosted and won Favorite Female Musical Performer) and the American Music Awards (Favorite Female Country Artist), the February 16th appearance marks the second time Reba has appeared on The Rosie O'Donnell Show.
Later this month, Reba will begin work on the CBS-TV movie, "Forever and Always," tentatively scheduled to air in May.
