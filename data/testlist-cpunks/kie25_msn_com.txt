@_subject: A DIRTY LITTLE JOKE!!! 
ï¿½    The other day I was out playing some golf ... and my ball    landed on the rough in a patch of buttercups.ï¿½ As I lifted    my club in the air I heard a faint voice ... "Please don't    hurt my buttercups, buttercups."ï¿½ I lowered my club and took    a quick glance back and forth to make sure that I was alone.    Satisfied that I was alone, I began to raise my club ... and    again came the same voice, this time a bit louder, "Please    don't hurt my buttercups, buttercups."ï¿½ This time I was so    sure of the voice that I spoke aloud, "Hello, is someone out    there." No sooner than I had finished speaking a tiny fairy    appeared before me.ï¿½ "I am the forest fairy, if you don't    hurt my buttercups then I'll give you all the butter you    could want for the rest of your life." and so I replied ...    "Where the hell where you when I was in the pussywillows?"    ï¿½
