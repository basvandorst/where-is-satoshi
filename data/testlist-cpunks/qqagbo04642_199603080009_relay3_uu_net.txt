That's all this guy said.
Here's my more verbose response.
You are _entitled_ to not "agree" with me.  What you are NOT entitled to, however, is to have a government that violates my rights by attempting to restrict crypto and other freedoms, even if it is with the support of 51% of the Congress or 51% of the voters or 51% of the population.  (or even substantially more.)  If you actively support such a government, or even encourage such a government, you are doing what is analogous to "inciting a riot":  You are guilty of inciting the government to take improper, illegal, unconstitutional, or simply immoral actions against me and others, and in my opinion if such actions are taken you enter into that conspiracy.
You may be alarmed that I might consider you a criminal for just exercising your "free speech."  (If you're not alarmed, you SHOULD be!)  I myself would greatly prefer to live in a society where speech was totally free:  There would be no laws against libel and slander, and you could "yell 'fire' in a crowded theatre" without the possibility of prosecution.  (All the other potential customers will be home watching on tape rental, which will make what you can do in a theatre less significant.)
But until we live in such a world, I consider that yelling "child porn!" or "terrorism!" or "drug smuggling" in "a crowded Congress" or _to_ "a crowded Congress" that's anxious to restrict our rights ever further, is an incitement to violate my rights.
No, I don't think you do.  You've done NOTHING to actually _support_ my right to disagree, except possibly waste a few bytes of information space on a message that you did not see fit to publicize.  (I did, however.)  Clearly, your "support" for my "right to disagree" is essentially non-existent.
