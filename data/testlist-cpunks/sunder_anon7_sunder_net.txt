Yes, at the windows command prompt, or notepad, or other text field, type
in the letters U, S, and A, and then hit your ENTER key, which is located
on the right hand side of the main part of the keyboard - before the page
up/down set.  On older keyboards, the enter key may be labeled RETURN.  On some keyboards, it may only have a symbolic arrow.
On a standard QWERTY keyboard, the letter U is on the top letter row as
the 7th key, the letter S on the middle row of keys as the 2nd key, and
the letter A is to the left of S.
It is of course also possible to enter other key combinations without a
green card, blue card, or even a red card.  All you have to do is type.
Of most interest to you should be the Control-Alt and Del keys, which you
should often hold down together at the same time.
