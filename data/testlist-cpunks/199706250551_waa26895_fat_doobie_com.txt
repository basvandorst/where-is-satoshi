Just for the record, _The Anarchist's Cookbook_ is full of
purposefully dangerous misinformation. It is written so that if you
follow enough of its recipies, you *will* kill yourself. I suggest old
archives or the newsgroup rec.pyrotechnics, which, until is self-
censored itself, provided excellent safety advice as well as how to
make things go boom. I'd imagine that there is still a wealth of
information about safety.
BTW, when making nitrocellulose, ice baths are your friends, cold
water will just not do. "standing on top of the world/ never knew how you never could/ never knew
