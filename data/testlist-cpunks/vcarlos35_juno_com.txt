Hi everyone,
I'm running an Type 1 (or Cypherpunks) Remailer at CharmQuark at juno.com,
GoddessHera's Juno Remailer ver 4.9, with nym capabilities turned on.
Send a message with subject "remailer-help" (No quotes) for more

@_subject: RC5 encryption 
Forgive this seemingly naive question, but....
Where does RC5 derive its security from?
I know about the ROTL stuff and the key expansion
methods (I have the RSA Cryptobytes, HAC, AC, etc.)
However, I personally can't see how it would work. I know its
supposedly secure because of the data-dependent rotations, and
other features.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but a ROTL assembler command shifts all
bits to the LEFT one and moves the "overflow" bits back into the right
end of the register:
0100111011 to 0011101101 if it rotates left by 2
How does this make it hard to decrypt? The round function seems MUCH
weaker than IDEA's, CAST's, or even GOST and Blowfish.

@_subject: Access RC4 
Around June/July of 1995, the Cypherpunks list coordinated an
attack on MS Access's RC4 encryption key. Does anybody know
what happened with it?
(I was found a partial archive of the RC4 attack, but it stopped
around July 11, 1995)

@_subject: The spoofers have gotten more sophistocated! 
The people that have been spoofing Jason Bobier, Philip Zimmerman, and
Randall Framer
have recently become more sophistocated in their techniques. They started
with barely
disguised headers and moved to equally lame PGP signed messages (that
nobody in
their right mind would accept, since the public keys have NO TRUSTED
Next, they progressed to faking the server-bounce messages to avoid
giveaway headers. For example, they did a very good forgery of a email
supposedly coming from PGP, even included the "shival.pgp.com" and
portions with correct IP addresses and all.
I have a feeling this problem will only get worse....

@_subject: Miller-Rabin prime number testing 
Does anyone have any information on the Miller-Rabin probabalistic
primality test?
I'm pretty sure its on page 260 of Applied Cryptography 2nd edition, but
I lent mey copy  to
someone and he's away.
Please email me/the list if you have this algorithm.

@_subject: DES search 
A few terabytes of storage isn't THAT expensive.
Let's see:
1,000,000,000,000 bytes
a CDROM holds about 640 MB, which means that 1563 CDs could hold it.
At CompUSA, that were recently selling recordable CD's for $10 for five,
with a mail-in $10 rebate which means you're only paying 32 cents for
for 5 CD's. .32*1563=$500 or so.
Add in the cost of a few CD-R drives @ $300 each = $900 for recording.
Combined total=$1400
Within the reach of distributed.net, I would think.

@_subject: programming 
The problem with C or pascal is that it requires quite a bit of punctuation such as:
braces {}
parentheses ()
and semicolons ;
Since your keyboard seems to be missing even a
period, programming in C may be a bit difficult...
Sorry. Couldn't resist.
