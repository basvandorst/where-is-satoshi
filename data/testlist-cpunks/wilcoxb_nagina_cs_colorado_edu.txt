@_subject: Using private keys on "insecure" multi-user systems for fun and profit! 
[The following is being posted to alt.security.pgp, sci.crypt, and
cypherpunks and e-mailed to my friend Sebastian.  -Bryce]
Ed Pugh writes that he doesn't sign all his e-mail because he doesn't have a
decent off-line news/mail setup.  I strongly suggest to Ed, and all others
who have this complaint (of whom there seem to be many), that they go ahead
and generate a "reduced security" key pair for use on-line.  That is, the
private key will be accessed while you are on-line so that it is easy for you
to use it for routine signing and encryption/decryption.
There are at least 3 good reasons to do this:
1.  Even though a hacker or sysadmin on your system can then read your mail
or fake mail from you, at least a hacker or sysadmin on *my* system can't
read my mail to you or fake mail from you to me.
2.  "Think of it as a form of solidarity."  If everyone used these "reduced
security" keys, and the hypothetical Big Brother police organizations want to routinely scan e-mail for keywords or something, they would have to secretly get access to every ISP and freenet in the country!  By transmitting your e-mail in the clear you are making their job a lot 3.  The more people have "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----" in their UseNet posts and e-mail, the more people will say "Hey what is this PGP stuff?" or "Hey, everyone seems to be using PGP, maybe I should get in on it."
  By using a "reduced-security" private key you are gaining some of the advantages of public-key cryptography for yourself as well as contributing to its widespread acceptance in net.society.
  (You might think that most people on the Internet know about PGP, but this
is not true.  Only a fraction have even heard of it, and only a *small*
fraction have any understanding of it.  A small fraction of *that* population
uses it regularly, which is what I am trying to change.)
Ed wrote that he downloads text to his home computer and signs it with his
high-security private key there when he feels that it is important enough.
He should continue to do this!  I have one key which I keep on my home
computer (and which my more paranoid friends like to use) and one which I
keep on colorado.edu computers.  (Both keys have signed each other, by the
way.)  I know that Zimmermann specifically warns against what I am suggesting in
pgpdoc1.txt, and I think that it is a mistake for him to do so.
In short, there is no reason why every PGP-aware individual should not
at least clearsign if not encrypt every message which he or she transmits.  There are several advantages to doing this and no disadvantages.
The greatest threat to security is that people don't use it!  Help change that by encrypting/signing *all* of your output.

I have to concur on this point.  Posting conspiracy tracts to cypherpunks, or
posting algorithm ideas to the conspiracy list, only serves to dilute the
primary function of the list in question.
J. Orlin Grabbe's actions in this respect are harmful (though of course

I'd like to go on record as stating that all of these other systems pretty
much suck.  Mondex, for example, actually stores non-crypto messages of the
type "Hi there I represent one hundred Belgian crowns" in its cards, so if
you can hack the "front-door" security (possibly with physical hacking of the
card) and convince a Mondex card that your PC is another Mondex card you can
transfer infinite money to it.  (Well, I suppose you wouldn't be able to
transfer more than 2^64 units of currency or some such limit, but you get the
Contrast this with DigiCash's scheme in which each cyberbuck is
cryptographically unforgeable.
Most of the other companies have similarly weak security.  Many of them are
not offering any new technology at all, but are simply offering to transport
your credit card number for you, encrypted, over the net.
Furthermore none of DigiCash's competitors, as far as I have been able to
learn, offer any kind of anonymity the way DigiCash does.  The closest they
come is "confidentiality".  Yeah-- right.  I can get the same offer from the
Ministry of Truth.
Finally, be aware that e-cash can be put onto a smart card just as well as
on a magentic disk.  DigiCash is actually in the process of developing and/or marketing smart cards that hold such things as toll token for toll roads and
civic credits for coffee houses in Europe.  See their home page for more
detailed (and probably more accurate) info.

I understand what you mean, although *my* primary interest is techno-enthusiasm and near-future sociological speculation.  :-)
I'm afraid these words will turn out to be prophetic.  On the other hand, the
nature of this market is such that the industry leadership can turn-over
quickly.  I expect that the factor which has the most inertia in this game is
consumer mind-share.  The other factors-- capital, technology, skilled labor,
publicity-- can all be quickly gained by any aggressive new start-up that
wants them.
According to Steven Levy (in his Wired mag story on David Chaum), Chaum
refuses to make deals with companies that would cut corners on his privacy
provisions.  I don't know how accurate that story is, but if it is true it
would explain why DigiCash is the technological leader and the marketplace dark horse.

@_subject: True Names and Webs of Trust 
My point exactly.  My post "Stop Fixating on True Names" was an attempt to
clarify things to said people.
Look at it this way:  leaving aside the fact that a Man-In-The-Middle has to
do a little more fast footwork than a normal old eavesdropper does, public
key cryptography does not actually give you *any* advantage over symmetric-key
cryptography except for this one fact:
You can ask George what Alice's public key is, but you can't ask him what
her-and-your shared (symmetric) secret key is!
- From this perspective, the Web of Trust is the soul of public-key
cryptography.  From the other perspective ("Never ever sign a key which you
got off of a bulletin board!" warns "pgpdoc1.txt") it is a cute anachronism.
By the way, you mentioned "people who don't fully understand the issue"--
a brief survey of e-mail and posts I have seen on this subject indicates to
me that even knowledgeable people like the cypherpunks are about evenly split
on whether they appreciate this concept or not.

You are quite right that this paragraph was unclear.  I meant "don't worry
about whether my public key is signed where signing means certifying the
mapping between my key and my physical identity.", not "don't worry about whether my public key is signed where signing means certifying the mapping
between my key and a perceived identity of mine.".
It is unfortunate that a PGP key-signature has such ambiguous semantics, but
again it is my fault for being unclear above.
wilcoxb> Zimmermann et al. were/are naive to emphasize the Web of
wilcoxb> Trust as a means of introducing strangers.
patl> The first paragraph clarifies nothing because it is dead wrong; the
patl> second because it is arrogant, offensive, and dead wrong.
Pshaw.  I think it's funny when people gasp in horror if you say something
disrespectful of Saint Phil.
Here, I'll say it again:  Zimmermann was naive to emphasize the Web of
Trust as only legitimate for public key<->Real-Life-identity mappings.  In
the future such mappings will be rare, while the Web of Trust will be used
extensively for public key<->virtual-identity mappings.
(The alert observer will notice that I changed some things between the first
and second invocations of the Disrespectful Assertion.  This is because when
I wrote the first version I was still confused about the ambiguity between
"Web of Trust as set of key<->Real-Life-identity mappings" and "Web of Trust as set of key<->identity mappings".)
patl> Given that active attacks are hard to explain and understand fully,
I'll say!  I'm having a very hard time understanding all of this clearly.
patl> the PGP docs are correct to advocate a conservative approach to
patl> signing keys.  Novices *should* be taught to take the Web of Trust
patl> seriously.  (Yes, I am retracting my own statements quoted above; the
patl> more I think about it, the more I think it is very hard to teach a
patl> novice the details of active attacks.)
Be that as it may, I still think that Zimmermann assumed that
key<->real-life-identity mappings would be the primary purpose for the Web of Trust when he wrote "pgpdoc1.txt".  And I think he was wrong about that.
It is not "arrogant" or "offensive" to say that someone was wrong when you
believe that to be the case.
patl> Moreover, I suspect that active attacks are more likely today than
patl> when those docs were written, which makes their advice precisely the
patl> opposite of an "anachronism".
Furthermore, Phil's advice to only sign keys which you have physically verified actually makes it easier for an attacker to get In-The-Middle-Of you and me.  This is because there is no Web of physically-verified keysigs between you and me.  If Phil had recommended treating public keys as being equivalent to net.personas, and verifying them as such, (or better yet, had provided a certificate mechanism to do so in *addition* to the current certificates) then there would be a Web of non-physically-verified keys between you and me, which would be much harder for an attacker to subvert.
Since you and I do not share any such Web, we are not any better off than if
we were using symmetric-key cryptography, as far as privacy goes!
(Authentication is of course another matter.)
Ah, the irony.  By insisting on maximally-strong links between each node in
the Web, you generate a much weaker Web than if you allowed weaker individual
links in greater quantity.
Thank you for your correspondance, Patrick and others.  I look forward to
more constructive interaction.

protecting my e-mail from spying/forgery.

That's just about right.
Right now I am thinking of e$ as a "collectors item" or a fun thing to
brag about in some distant year.  I'm offering US$1.00 for e$15.00, but
I will quit offering that price once I run out of US$ or decide that I
have enough e$!
I think that the ecm market is probably composed of very few people who
mostly want to buy, and is therefore not a high-volume market!  If the ecm
market got a link from the DigiCash home page (which I'm sure it could do)
then you would probably get lots of people who just got their free e$100.00
and who are willing to sell part of it after having experienced the wonders
of the slot machines and the "e$0.01-per-move tic-tac-toe" games.
  Could we set up a WWW version of the ecm market, listing latest offers
to anyone with a WWW browser?  Things might really pick up-- at least for
us buyers!
I'm also considering other strategies for gaining e$--  offering a service
on the DigiCash "cybershops" page, or just going to all my e-mail using
friends, showing them how to get their free e$100.00, and then begging them
to give me half of it.  (Finder's fee?  Friendly gift?)
Possibly I shouldn't have posted the above and given my e$-collecting
competitors the idea, because eventually DigiCash is going to quit giving
out freebies!  Hopefully my friends will get on the ball and acquire their
freebies before that point!  :-)   [mental note to add some of said friends
to the Cc: line...]

@_subject: Here it is; bi-directional dining cryptographers 
Chaum discusses it a lot in his original DC paper.  In the limit, any
disrupter can be ousted from the Net.  What you do is "trap" the disrupter
by getting all ready to speak and then not saying anything.  (The only reason
that you do not say anything is that you are about to reveal your secret
bits, and anything you say will be traceable to you.  If you don't mind getting identified with your words this once then go ahead.)  The disrupter
foolishly blurts out some garbage at that instant and then everyone holds
up their secret bits to see who "lied" about their XOR (who inverted their
output when they weren't supposed to.)
  Of course if all but one or two participants are colluding disrupters
then it will probably be the one or two who are ousted instead of the
disrupters!  But this is sort of the same effect, no?
This presupposes a block-scheduling algorithm, or at least a set-up in which
the disrupter is committed to his output *before* he realizes that his
intended victim is not transmitting.
Are you familiar with the topology of DC-nets-- how anonymity is preserved
relative to two participants as long as there is a "path" of shared bits
between them?  (That is, A shares with B who shares with C, now A and C are
anonymous relative to each other.  Of course if B decides to out them, then they are high and dry.  The interesting thing is that if A and C both
start sharing with D, then C is no longer capable of outting them unless he
collaborates with D.)  The result is that each individual participant in a
DC net can increase their level of security just by sharing with a new
partner.  (Of course, if that new guy is a tentacle of the "anti-anon" colluders, then the individual has not actually increased their security.
But they have not decreased it either.)
I really like that about DC-net topology--  any two participants can elect
to boost their anonymity-level without needing the other participants'
permission and without increasing the workload on the other participants.

and the University's 2.6.2 but when I am on my home computer I use another
<148A11E5> and my linux PGP 2.6.1 (I'm going to upgrade it any day now...).
I also have a couple of other keys with "Bryce Wilcox" in the User ID field
for other uses.
  The problem/gripe is that whenever I try to manipulate public keys on
my keyring, PGP grabs the first one with User ID "Bryce".  How do I extract,
edit, sign, etc. the *other* "Bryce" keys on my public keyring.  I tried
giving PGP the Key ID, which seemed like the most reasonable user interface
to me, but that didn't work.
Third, how do I set those "PGP-Note" strings that appear in some people's
PGP Signature Blocks?
And lastly, a gripe.  Zimmermann's "pgpdoc1.txt" needs to be changed.
Let me explain:  I am in the (long, drawn-out) process of trying to convince
my friends and family members to use PGP.  The first hurdle is that it is
a pain in the butt to use, and they are not going to use it if it means they
have to learn a handful of Unix commands and spend 30 seconds screwing with
it every time they want to send mail.  But that isn't the subject of this
  The second hurdle manifests when I send them a copy of "pgpdoc1.txt".  They
start browsing through it and come upon "NEVER EVER use PGP on a remote,
multi-user system.  It wouldn't have maximum security in that situation."
  They say "Oh, well I guess I can't use it then because damned if I'm going
to upload and download all of my mail at 1200 baud just so Bryce will quit bugging me about this PGP thing."
  So I say "No no no, using it on a remote system is still better than
nothing.  Just be aware that it is easier to crack your secret key when
you use it there than if you kept it on your home computer."
  So they go back to reading "pgpdoc1.txt" and it says "NEVER EVER use a
public key which was sent to you through the Net.  It could be tampered with."
  So they say, "What, I have to make a long-distance phone call to Cousin Joe
in Israel before I can send him a 'Happy Birthday' message using PGP?  Why
  And I say "No no no, using a key which you got through the Net is better than using no key at all, just be aware that if someone *really* wanted
to spy on you that they could have tampered with it.  When you see Cousin
Joe next Christmas you can compare keys with him and make sure you have the
right one."
In short, pgpdoc1.txt needs to quit saying "NEVER EVER use PGP in other than
MAXIMAL SECURITY situations" and start saying "If you want MAXIMAL security,
do it this way, and if you are satisfied with lesser security, here are
other options."
I am fond of saying that we PGP enthusiasts have two choices ahead of us
within a couple of years:  either 5,000 enthusiasts using PGP with
MAXIMAL SECURITY at all times, or 5,000 enthusiasts with MAXIMAL
SECURITY and 10,000,000 computer-illiterate e-mail users using PGP with
push-button interfaces and multi-user remote systems.
The important thing, of course, is the easy-to-use, e-mail-integrated
software (version 3.0, I hope?), but it would also help if Zimmermann's
PGP Doc didn't tell those computer-illiterates to either "become enthusiasts
or don't use it."

@_subject: [NOISE] Re: censored? corrected [Steve Pizzo cited in The Spotlight] 
That's one way to look at it.  Of course since the "license requirements" had to do with some obscure administrivia that nobody
thought would apply to ISP's, none of the 6 or so ISP's in Hong Kong
had thought to apply for it.  One has to wonder why the gov't pulled
the plug on 5 of them without so much as a warning, much less a
chance to comply.
Did I say 5?  Oh yes.  The largest HK ISP-- and the one with closest
ties to the government-- had gone ahead and applied for the license
just a couple of weeks before the blackout.  Corruption is the modus
operandi in HK, so I wouldn't be at all surprised if that one ISP
got a special favor by being warned of the impending black-out, or
even if it had a hand in instigating it.
I'm sure you'll correct me if I've got any of my facts wrong.
(c'punks relevance:  (parts of) the Net is still vulnerable to
governmental blackout.  Is this relevant?  Well, hardly, but perhaps
interesting.  And at least I flagged it.)

@_subject: technical and social structures in the pseudonymous economy 
When a person does business pseudonymously (where I consider
pseudonymity to be == anonymity & non-repudiation & two-way
communication (where non-repudation presupposes some sort of
identifier of the actor)) then that person is exempt (for the most
part) from the threat of physical retribution, the force of law,
etc.  Thus in order to be trusted with some valuable information
such as money this person needs to offer up some collateral which
can be debitted in the case that they violate their contract.  Of course this raises the question of who holds the collateral, and it is
a big open spot where statists might jump in with their tired old rhetoric (as soon as they clue in to what's going on here), but I sincerely hope that a highly redundant, interdependent, robust set of private "lien, escrow and arbitration" agencies take up the job.
As a simple example, pseudonymous E-bank customers can be required to keep positive balances in their accounts, and in the case that they
are caught trying to double-spend or commit other fraud, a fine can be
withdrawn from this account by the bank.  This model can be applied to
any pseudonymous transaction or contract.  It is important to note that this technique does *not* eliminate the risk of fraud--  it reduces the likelihood that the pseudonymous customer can commit fraud
successfully and it *increases* the likelihood that the bank can do
Of course this is not necessary if we are not giving the pseudonym any
opportunity to cheat us (because we are using all on-line clearing etc.) but for most (I think) applications it is necessary to extend to
the pseudonym some amount of trust, in the form of a "loan" or other credit, or, in the form of other digital credentials, access to information etc. etc.
I consider this to be a very important idea for the development of
the cyberspace economy/community/libertaria and as I mentioned it
is a point where it would be more easy for the statists to attempt an inroad into said community.
I envision a situation in which a pseudonym cannot cheat anyone out
of more money than he has already put up as collateral on his
contract.  Thus mere cyber-fraud is never profitable.  Instead, the only way to cheat people is to subvert the escrow&arbitration agencies
into ruling unfairly in your favor, allowing you to abscond with your collateral and so forth.  This, unfortunately, moves the whole mess of
"law and society" from the elegant cryptographic solutions that we all
love back into the realm of politics, social ideology and so forth, but I think we are in a better position to insure fair dealings now
that we have these cryptographic capabilities like non-repudiation
& privacy, and the currency & transaction protocols which follow
from them.
Note that because the escrow&arbitration agencies are likely to be large, redundant and interdependent a petty criminal will not have much chance of subverting them, but a major one-time heist is theoretically effective, as is the organized, large-scale extortion which does not heist it all at once but which instead siphons off an
extortion (tax) payment at regular intervals.  (Note strong resemblance between this last criminal strategy and the behavior of most governments.)
Of course I'm not the first to think about these kinds of things.
 Nick Szabo (szabo at netcom.com) in particular has thought a lot about making the escrow&arbitration process mathematically deterministic, when he talks
about his "liens" and "smart contracts", but my intuition is that the domain of contracts which are amenable to mathematically-controlled
escrow&arbitration is much smaller than the domain of contracts which need a trusted intelligence to do the escrow&arbitration.  (Nick also discusses the trusted-intelligence issues, such as using n-of-m key splitting to distribute the arbitration power.)
In summary:  lien, escrow and arbitration agencies, which are endowed
by the principals with the authority to adjudicate fraud cases, and which are entrusted by the principals with the electronic cash, crypto
keys, and so forth to enforce their decisions, will be essential to the operation of the pseudonymous economy.  These agencies will
themselves be the targets and/or the perpetrators of theft, however.
Concerned citizens of the world need to start thinking about how to
minimize these risks.  Factors to consider include:  The relatively
low start-up costs of such agencies, the role of governments, mafia, or other force-wielding organizations, and "the problem of pseudonymity" (can't tell if two pseudonyms are under same True Person's control) possibly leading to a single organization controlling a large enough share of escrow&arbitration services that it can initiate heists or extortion.
I'll be trying to write these ideas of mine into a set of HTML
documents for display on my web pages.  I appreciate all
constructive correspondance.
(P.S.  Of course a pseudonym's reputation may be considered by some
to be valuable enough to use as this "collateral" or "lien".   It wouldn't be so considered by me.  I'd take cash.)

@_subject: Who needs time vaults anyway? 
Hey!  Who do you think you are?
Just kidding.  When I woke up this morning I realized what I was
missing:  the decryption might be out of your hands, such as when
you die, or you might *want* it to be out of your hands for some
other reason.
With that in mind, I can think of only one unalterable lower-limit
on the time of as decryption--  the speed of light.  Suppose you
encrypt your data with successive layers of keys, K1-Kn.  Then you
encrypt each key with its predecessor, encrypting Kn with Kn-1,
encryping Kn-1 with Kn-2, etc.  Destroy all copies of unencrypted
keys except for K1, which has not been encrypted.  Now put all
odd-numbered keys in location A and all even-numbered keys in
location B, which is 1 light minute from location A.  Once an agent
has received Key 1, it will take at least n minutes to decrypt the data.  Of course, the agent could just take copies of all of the keys from location B on some physical media and transport the media to location A, which would make the lower bound on time to be "much longer than 1 minute".
Hm.  Suppose the n different keys are in n different physical
locations, and the agent does not know where the k+1 location is
until he decrypts the material at the k location.  The "scavenger
hunt" scheme for timed decryption.  Of course this doesn't mean that
you have to bury your crypto box and make a map with an "X" marking
the spot.  Each key could be held by a crypto box which is
publically accessible on the Net.  The important thing is that
the decrypting agent can't retrieve the k+1 piece until he has decrypted the k piece.  Then the lower bound on time of decryption is...  um...  Well it depends on the location of the decrypting agent with respect to the locations of the n pieces.  (Neglecting, still, transmission overhead and decryption time.)  I'm not sure what the lower bound actually is, but it can be increased simply by adding more pieces to the puzzle.
A single station could serve up multiple pieces.  It would only
reveal the k piece if the querying agent can prove that he has the k-1 piece.  Of course if the total number of stations is small then the "physically move the pieces" trick might work.

@_subject: encryption in BeOS kernel 
Some of you may be aware of this interesting new computer named the
"BeBox" which will start shipping in Q1 96 I think.
 Go here for more info. A paragraph on the Q&A page caught my attention and when they asked
for expert advice I naturally thought of you guys.
"Q: What security protection will the BeBox have?
 A: We're planning to offer a security/encryption mechanism at the
 kernel level. However, we haven't nailed down the details of this
 mechanism, so your expert input would be appreciated. One of our
 primary interests is to allow encryption of application software for
 individual machines. (The flash ROM in each BeBox will be serialized
 in the portion of the ROM which is unmodifiable.)"
I have two things to add:
1.  The scheme they mention there is, I think, intended to be a software protection scheme and like all such is doomed to failure.  I hope they don't spend to much effort on it.  On the other hand
there might be some nifty crypto applications that could use this
unique identifier.  Although none come to mind...
2.  Be, Inc. is located in Menlo Park, CA, USA and Paris, France.  They couldn't have picked two countries who are more likely to royally screw them by restricting the export/sale of their product once said product has encryption built-in.  (Of course they could put the encryption in a loadable kernel module, which would be an interesting test of ITAR's "crypto-with-a-hole" restrictions.)
I hope the NSA isn't reading this and getting ideas...

@_subject: MITM attacks and True Names (again...) 
What is the difference between having a conversation with a spook masquerading as a cypherpunk (or vice versa) and having a conversation which is, unbeknownst(sp?) to either of you, monitored and modified by a "Man in the Middle" (hereafter: "Mitch", the Man in the Channel)?
The difference is that in the second case there actually is an entity,
separate from the one in control of the other end of your conversation,
with whom you are (sort of) conversing.  Furthermore it is practically
(if not theoretically) possible for that entity to evade Mitch and
contact you directly.  So much for the debate about "talking to public
(As an aside I fully sympathize with those who rail against the popular
(?) impression that a True Name is somehow necessary to communication.
That is a dangerous idea, since all a True Name is really necessary for
is violence.  (And, pending certain eagerly-awaited technological
developments, for sex.))
Now I have four things to say about this "evasion of Mitch" thing.
Don't worry, they are all short and some of them are interesting.
1.  A dense, strong Web of Trust is very important.  This should already be obvious, but point 2 should make it even more so.
2.  It should be each person's responsibility to ensure that their true public key has reached the Web of Trust.  If you make a habit of delivering copies of your true public key to members of the Web of Trust via multiple channels which should be difficult for Mitch to intercept, (e.g. snail mail, connections from pay phones to local net nodes, courier delivery, phone calls, face-to-face meetings, etc. etc) then you can make it arbitrarily difficult for Mitch to keep your true public key off the WoT.
  Others can just use the public key for you which they get from the
WoT (of course, they have to make sure that *they* are strongly
connected to the Web by sending their own public key through multiple
channels!).  If other keys show up claiming to be you then we have an
interesting denial-of-service sort of scenario where psychology and
reputation and crypto and all kinds of interesting stuff get mixed in,
but at least we are relatively safe from an un-noticed MITM attack.
3.  There is one other method that can help foil Mitch: the "overload
his processors" trick.  Pay attention to the lag time between
transmission and reception of messages.  Then send a very large
message, or many messages simultaneously.  If it takes longer to get
there (modulo normal processing penalty, normal net lag variation, the
possibility that Mitch was delaying transmissions specifically in
preparation for this trick, etc etc etc) then you know Mitch is in the
channel.  Highly interactive, complex-signal stuff like voice and video
is perfect for this.  Even the NSA can't intercept a PGPFone session
and fake my voice in real time, echoing me when necessary and replacing
my words with other words when necessary.  For this reason PGPFone will
hopefully be quite a boon to the Web O T.  (Thanks to Seb Kuzminsky for
bringing the "overload his processors" trick to my attention.)
4.  Mitch's big opportunity is to strike before the Web is formed.
Once your key is in the Web then his only options are:  1.  acquire
your secret key.  2.  wait til you forget your passphrase and then get
in the middle when you announce a new public key unsigned by the old
one.  or 3.  launch a really mean denial of service attack on you.  This is one of the reasons that I sign almost all of my outgoing
messages, even to people who don't use PGP.  I can use these
accumulated messages to demonstrate to others that I, Bryce, really was
in control of the PGP public key whose ID is 0x617c6db9 and the one
whose ID is 0x148a11e5 during this time.  This might be important
  (My *primary* reason for clearsigning everything is to let others know
about PGP's existence and to encourage them to start using it.)
  (And to advertise my cybershop product...)

Whoops, you're sure right.  Alice will not be revealing the bill's ID,
she will be revealing her "double-spending prevention" field.  Hm.  I suppose that her victim (the one who received the pre-spent bill and
was "out"'ed) could have turned the bill in sans double-spending
prevention field if the protocol allowed for it and if he didn't mind
the risk of letting Alice get away with a bona fide double-spend.
Of course, if the bank allows anon accounts you can launder your e-coin
through these first.  Also, suppose I start a payee-anonymity service?
(a.k.a. e-laundering service).  You send me the e-coin you received, I deposit it with the bank, check out a new coin, and send you the new
coin.  (Minus my percentage.)  Of course, now *I* have the ability to
sting you...
Regrettably, Tim C. May is right and current Chaumian Ecash can't do
off-line clearing without enabling stings in which payers can prove
which bank account the payee used to deposit the coin.  (Not quite the
same as proving the payee's identity, but...)  Marcel van der Peijl of
DigiCash once bragged to me in private e-mail that they could probably
do both-way anonymity in off-line clearing if they really wanted to.
Does anyone else think that this is possible?  Unlike Tim, I think
that off-line clearing capability is a big plus.

@_subject: How can e-cash, even on-line cleared, protect payee identity? 
Well I've decided that the best way to learn is to stick my neck out
and say something probably stupid in public.  So here I go again:
In an on-line clearing e-cash scheme, Chaum's "double-spender
identifier" fields are unnecessary, but a "serial number" type field
to uniquely identify the e-coin is still necessary.  Using blinding,
this serial number may be unknown to the bank, but it will be known
to the payer.  If the payer and the bank are collaborating to
identify the payee, then they can simply use this serial number to
identify the recipient of the coin.
Is there a scheme which will prevent this collusive payee identification, and if so where can I read about it?  (On-line is preferable of course, but I don't expect to be that fortunate.)
Now even if it were the case that the payee is always identifiable
by a collusion of the bank and the payer (such as is the case in
DigiCash Ecash), all this means is that you shouldn't accept a coin
using one nym, and deposit it in the bank using another.  You need
one bank account per nym, as well as one bank account per
anonymous transaction, and then you have complete control over
revelation of your identit(y/ies).
I can imagine a future in which this requirement is not difficult to
meet.  Perhaps it will be the case that you can accept a coin, open
up a new ("anonymous") account with the bank, deposit the coin, withdraw a new coin of the same amount, close the account, and now have an untraceable coin all in a fraction of a second.

@_subject: How can e-cash, even on-line cleared, protect payee identity? 
Now it seems to me that any ecash scheme, whether cleared on-line or
off-line, with or without double-spending-detection, will put the
payee at risk of identification by a collusion of the payer and the
bank.  As far as I can tell, Chaum's off-line,
double-spending-detecting DigiCash Ecash is no more or less
susceptible to this attack than is any other scheme.  (This is
because the e-coin must have a unique ID or serial number, and the
payer/bank collusion can trace the passage of that serial number to
identify the payee.)
TC May has stated that Chaum's off-line strategy enables
payee-identification by a payer/bank collusion, but it seems to me that this is incorrect, because payee-identification is *always*
possible by a payer/bank collusion under any scheme.
 ""TC May"":
Right, if the bank allows anon accounts and/or accounts that can be
created and used with very little time/effort/expense.  Now if the
bank doesn't allow that then you could have a chain of
money-laudering "remailer" type services.  They will deposit the
coin for you and withdraw a new one, thus making it untraceable
*unless* they themselves are in on the collusion.
Perhaps you "chained remailer" people can apply your expertise to this
and invent for us a method of laundering your e-coin through a chain

@_subject: How can e-cash, even on-line cleared, protect payee identity? 
Especially since you didn't want anyone to know that you had that
coin in the first place.  This makes it somewhat more difficult to
announce to the world "Hey!  He just stole my coin!".
 I, Bryce:
 "'Hal'":
Careful here.  A given nym's transactions are known only if the
person that they were dealing with chooses to collude with the bank
and reveal it.  Hopefully this would not be the status quo!  (If the
status quo is going to be non-privacy, then we will be using a
different scheme in the first place...)
I mean: it is always true that a person who gave you money can say
"yeah, that's the guy I gave it to."  The only way that this is different from tangible cash is that the payer can *prove* to the bank that you are the recipient of their money.  And probably the bank and the payer together can prove it to the rest of the world.  (Hm.  Would they be able to prove it?  Perhaps the only way they would be able to prove that would be to time-stamp all their  "'Hal'":
Again I see an opportunity for "polymorphism".  A bank can use the
very same, or at least a very similar protocol to service both
account-holders and "check-in/check-out" customers.  (Perhaps the
only differences would be the speed with which the bank services the
requests, and the rate at which the bank charges for the service.)
I am excited about polymorphism (such as ) because of
social-engineering, evolutionary reasons.  Flexible protocols will
encourage institutions to compete by offering as much privacy,
security, off-line capability, efficiency, etc. as the customers
want, rather than dictating their own terms and trying to define the
market that way.  To the degree to which each capability is
economically beneficial, that capability will become the market

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
That's not me, but I have some things to say anyway.  If I could
figure out how to make DigiCash's SunOS client write money into
ASCII files I would attach 2 cybercents to the end of this.
I prefer to think that contractual relationships are defined by
the explicit stipulations the contract, and the implicit understandings
between the two parties (which are unavoidable, since they begin at
the semantic or even cognitive level and cannot be described
explicitly with our current science/tech, but which should be made
explicit wherever possible), and are completely *un*-influenced by
the arbitrary opinion of some third organization which happens to
own lots of big guns in their geographical regions.
Wouldn't be nice if whatever clauses two competent entities agreed
to were enforceable?  (non-repudiation, reputations, Nick
Szabo's "liens"...)
Indeed they do usurp that power, don't they?  :-)  And it's only going to get worse(/better).  ((anon)nymity, e-cash, tax evasion, black markets...)
And I, by way of contrast, consider such clauses, which remove
business relationships from the realm of violence and into the realm
of mutually consensual, organizationally emergent social structures, in a very positive light.
And I'm of the opinion that any "regulation" (i.e. threat of force
against peaceful parties) negatively affects my interests (all of
ours) in the long run.  And I too have a vote.
Crypto relevance?  Much!  The overview is that crypto tech will
ultimately enable my view of ideal social structure rather than
yours.  Non-repudiation, e-cash, Nick Szabo's "liens", tax evasion,
black markets, (anon)nymity, reputations and (hopefully hopefully) the education/enlightenment of the populace because of powerful
non-censorable information access all point this way.
Of course, it will be a long, twisted road from here to there (we
live in interesting times), but I am ultimately hopeful.

@_subject: idle CPU markets 
Well there are plenty of applications that want lots of cycles, but
there are several problems with the idle CPU market approach to getting
those cycles.
(Examples I can think of:  rendering of movie-quality graphics in
non-real-time, scientific computation/modelling, compiling...)
1.  Many such applications want their computation to be highly responsive--  the long turn-around involved in farming your task over a WAN is often prohibitive.  (E.g. real-time graphics.)
2.  Also many applications that need this kind of power are highly sensitive to inaccuracy or fraud.  A scientific modelling experiment which uses zillions of cycles can be rendered completely worthless if a tiny calculation that had been farmed to Joe Blow is done wrong or is lied about by Joe.
3.  Similarly, many such applications are highly confidential.
I'm sure some cypherpunks have good ideas on how to deal with
problems 3 and maybe 2...

A few months ago I decided that what the world needed was a friendly-

chains, safes, keys and so forth as appealing too much to those who
go for tech and tools.  I wanted something that would appeal to my

but this wasn't as fitting a metaphor...)

@_subject: There is still no perfectly anonymous currency 
It occurs to me that even in an on-line-cleared system, that a collusion of Ursula the Underwriter and Bob the Payer can identify Alice the Payee by traffic analysis based on time contraints.  Alice has to turn in the coin that Bob gave her in order to get it on-line-
cleared *before* she can close the deal with Bob assuming that she believes there is a chance Bob's coin is bad (pre-spent).  So Bob and Ursula can do some simple traffic-analysis-style coin-watching over the course of several transactions between Bob and Alice.
This could become infeasible for Bob and Ursula in the case that
there are very many such transactions going on at the same time and
Alice (and some of the other payees) prudently add a traffic-analysis-
foiling delay between acceptance of Bob's coin and turning it over to the bank, and between receiving confirmation from the bank and letting Bob know that the bank said "OK".  (Of course all this, and in fact all conversations on this subject, presume the existence and proper usage of identity-protecting communication protocols between Alice and Ursula and between Alice and Bob.)
Now in some applications it might be a problem for Alice to add
these delays.  (She might need to complete a great many transactions
in a limited amount of time.)  In this case Alice will have to
choose between efficiency and identity-protection.  Her tactic will
further be hampered by the fact that only Ursula knows how many
similar transactions are going on at any given time.  Alice will
have to guess.
In sum, I have still not seen a proposal for an electronic currency
scheme which ensures unconditional identity-protection for both payer and payee.  On the other hand, if a bank allows pseudonymous accounts,
or if coin-re-paying systems can be implemented, then some lesser degree of identity-protection is still attainable.  On the third hand, if a bank allows instant, cheap, anonymous accounts or, equivalently, if the bank issues coins in return (or as Tony Eng has
suggested, issues "deposit-vouchers" in return) instead of accessing
the payee's account, then ensuring unconditional identity-protection for both parties is easy under several protocols, including the Chaumian Ecash protocol.  (That is:  auto-coin-laundering via an instant, one-use anonymous account that you control or via a new coin or a deposit voucher
whose blinding factors you chose.)

I'm sorry-- what do you mean by "the recipient of funds is non-anonymous"?  I cannot envision any centralized currency system in which a user's funds
were *not* known to the bank!
Secondly, there is a tremendous difference between a person being able to
identify you as the recipient of their money (which they can pretty much do
anyway, with less surety, just by saying "That's him!  He's the one I gave
it to!") and a third party such as the bank or a government being able to
monitor all your transactions.  For such an organization to perform that feat
on a DigiCash user they would need the cooperation of all of the people with
whom he exchanges currency, and if they have that, then cryptography seems
irrelevant.  :-)

Chaum says that (especially when speaking before U.S. Congress) but I think
he is playing both sides of the fence.  He is a die-hard privacy advocate who
allegedly turns down lucrative business deals because he feels they would
dilute his privacy achievements.  The truth is that Chaumian DigiCash is a
*lot* safer for criminals than, say, credit cards, and when it is combined
with the other tools in a money launderer's toolbox, I expect it will be a
great boon to them.
Suppose you have acquired a million dollars worth of legal, above-board
DigiCash dollars and you want to surreptitiously transfer this wealth to a
below-board friend.  Your friend creates a temporary anonymous account at an
understanding bank.  You just use a lot of small denominations to squirt the
dollars to your friend's account.  Then he squirts them to his real accounts
and destroys the blinding factors that the temporary anon account used.
Now without active physical surveillance, nobody other than yourself and your
friend will ever know where the money went, and you can't prove that you gave
it to him, either...

@_subject: Why ecash is traceable 
So Alice/TheBank are able to tell that the nym whom Alice gave the coin to
is the same as the nym who deposited it.  If Bob has a pseudonymous
account at the bank, and it was the same pseudonymous account that he used in
the transaction with Alice, then they haven't learned anything new, but if he
wants to use one pseudonym when dealing with Alice and another to deposit the
coin he got from her then he has problems.
That's the extent of the damage, right?  Seems like it can be prevented by
laundering the coin through a single pseudonym first.  That is:  Bob receives
the coin from Alice, calling himself "CyberBob".  He deposits the coin with
the bank as a one-time-nym "Nym then he has that nym withdraw the same amount of money from its account (closing out the account) and transfers
it to the nym which will actually keep the money, "NormalBob".  He destroys the new blinding factors after the temporary nym has withdrawn the coin, he deposits the coin with the bank as "NormalBob", and now he is in the clear.
Am I missing anything?
If Bob's transaction with Alice was actually pseudonymous rather than
anonymous then he can just deposit the coin using the same pseudonym and they
haven't learned anything new.  Once he has done that he can safely transfer
the money to any other nym of his with no risk (except for traffic analysis,
physical surveillance, yadda yadda yadda).
So current (DigiCash "ecash") Chaumian protocol leads to complete anonymity/pseudonymity (there oughta be a word for that.  "self-nym-control"?) in the case that pseudonymous accounts are allowed at
the Bank.
Now one could move this "double-blinding" (isn't that phrase already in use?) trick into the cash protocol itself, possibly gaining a performance win.  DigiCash is apparently aware of this possibility, but (rightly) doesn't consider it important to develop right now.

Several people are working on improvements to netnews which allow more active
filtering.  The most promising techniques that I have heard about involve a
lot of "ratings" being generated by readers and then taken into account by
other readers when filtering/sorting the articles.
I am perfectly happy with the social scene on the cypherpunks list as is, and
I think those who want to move to a newsgroup don't know what they are asking
for.  (Go read sci.crypt and talk.politics.crypto for awhile.  I expect an
"alt.cypherpunks" would be indistinguishable from those two in short order.)
BUT, I was thinking that this group (I mean, this group of people) would make
an excellent group to test this new technology.  Think about it:  Perry
Metzger could routinely give conspiracy articles/authors a "-10" rating, and
those of us who agreed with him could set our "Perry coefficients" to
indicate the degree to which we agree with his evaluations.  Thus we might
actually gain a *higher* SNR by moving to UseNet.  (And it would provide an
exciting example of reputations in action...)
I don't know if the technology is there yet, or if it is accessible to most
of our readers.  One person who is working on such a scheme is "(cm)", or "na48985 at anon.penet.fi".  I have added his name to the Cc: line so perhaps he

signatures include a time-stamp from the system clock?  I'm going to get into the habit of including a time-stamp in the
clear-text from now on.  (I have sent so many PGP-clearsigned
messages, and many of them quite short, that an attacker could
almost hold up my end of a conversation using them.  :-) )

@_subject: mailbombing and anonymity -- inseparable 
Indeed.  And I would be delighted (sort of) if someone could
show me how my assertion above is incorrect.
Look I don't actually understand how remailers are currently
implemented, but for the purpose of this discussion it doesn't
matter.  Any sequence of steps that a legitimate correspondant
can use to send a letter a mailbomber can use to send an Now you can make the sequence of steps more complex in the hope of weeding out the less technically competent mailbombers,
but this is a weak solution which will also make remailnet even
more inaccessible to the barely technically competent people
who make up the vast majority of e-mail users.
Look at it this way.  How can one ensure that one receives only
the kind of e-mail that one likes?  I can think of only 3 ways:
1.  Discriminate based on content.  (killfiles, etc.)
2.  Discriminate based on authorship.  (PGP sigs, reputations,
3.  Retaliate against those who send you mail that you didn't
want.  (mail-bombing, reputation-trashing, social or legal
penalties, violence, assassination, etc.)
Now unconditional anonymity (or even "Pretty Good" anonymity a
la cpunks remailers) does away with option  right?  (I take a moment to note that this is precisely *why* we advocate
anonymity in the first place...)
So that leaves us with option  and option   It is
impossible for current computers to reliably identify for us
whether a given e-mail message is junk mail or not.  (I take a
moment to note that when it becomes possible for computers to do
so we will probably have bigger things to worry about...)
  *But* there is a lot that done with regard to discrimination
based on content.  First there's the obvious stuff-- killfiling
topics and keywords (like "NSA" and "ITAR" on cpunks...) and
splitting messages into different folders based on which list
they are from-- and then what about this idea:  someday people will include a few micro-dollars in their messages to encourage you to read them.  Now that would be interesing.
Now the schemes that I have seen aired here about how to
prevent these kinds of distributed e-mailbombs generally
focussed on a rough version of option  just discriminate
against multiple copies of the same content.  That's fine
(although some of my friends who are always sending me the same
jokes might get left out in the cold...) but you have to realize
that it is a weak fix that can be easily overcome by a
technically sophisticated attacker.
Also I think all such things should be done on the user's end.
I would thank *my* anonymous remailers to let me and my computer
decide what mail to trash.
Of course as always people should pay as they go to send mail.
Thus no direct financial harm is done to the recipient (or even
a pecuniary bonus!  See above) and the remailers could probably make a profit off of mailbombers.
I'll leave option  alone.  No fresh ideas today.
Okay I've wandered, but to restate my main point mailbombing and anonymity are *in general* inseparable.  Just as harassment,
intimidation, blackmail, libel, copyright violations and other "information crimes" will be encouraged by anonymity.  Get used
to it, or else stop advocating anonymity.

@_subject: noise levels 
An entity calling itself Perry  allegedly
Perry, I quite agree with you.  I am having a very difficult
time wading through cpunks, and I am currently reduced to
grepping for my name, and then picking out a topic or two by
subject line before junking 95% of the posts.  Since you have
such enthusiasm for solving the noise problem I suggest that we
do the following:
1.  Establish a "one-way" mailing list.  If you don't have an ISP which makes this convenient then I recommend Sameer's Community ConneXion.  It costs merely $7.50/month, it is very easy to create a mailing list, Sameer respects your privacy and
understands the importance of privacy and security issues, and
you can pay in Mark Twain Ecash.
2.  Write a script for your mail agent so that when you see a
noise post you can hit a key combination and send off a message
to all the recipients of your mailing list which identifies the
message (by its Message-ID, I suppose?) as trash.
3.  I will subscribe to your list.
4.  I will configure my mail user-agent to automatically delete
messages which have been identified by you as trash.
What do you say?  I'm up for it.
Hey, come to think of it I have a mailing list at C2 that isn't
being used for anything.  It is fortuitously named "c2punks".
Go ahead and send your "trash-o-meter" messages there and I will
receive them.  (That's "c2punks at c2.org".)
Of course there are some things we should work out as we go:
1.  You should PGP-sign your trash-o-meter messages.  Don't
worry about doing it on a secure box (who's going to crack your
e-mail hardware just so they can force me to read trash or delete cpunks mail from my inbox?).  You can configure your MUA to pass the passphrase to PGP (or have no passphrase) so that all you have to do is hit a single key combination to activate the "trashit" script.
2.  You might wonder what you are getting out of this?  I can
name 3 things:
   a.  Reducing the amount of c'groupies noise that I read, and
the amount of c'groupies noise that anyone else who subscribes
to "c2punks" reads.
   b.  Advancing the theory and practice of distributed ratings
   c.  I and others will reciprocate-- we will mail
"trash-o-meter" messages to c2punks which you can use so as to
read less trash yourself.
3.  I'll write some scripts that people can use to process trash-o-meter messages.  The first version will probably be in
sh and written for the mh mail-handling system.  Later versions
will work with different mail-handling systems, incorporate such
nifty features as author- and subject- trashing in addition to
message-trashin, having weighted scalar ratings, different
ratings categories, and so forth.
I'm entirely serious about this.  For the first iteration just
send something like "TRASH Message-ID: XXXXXXXXX" in the subject
line or the body.  We can discuss this in detail on c2punks if
it gets too specific to be on-topic in cpunks.  (What's your
flavor of MUA?  I'll write the trashit script for you.)

@_subject: DigiCash Ecash - 2 security topics 
An entity calling itself "Marcel van der Peijl"
  is alleged to have written:
What kind of performance hit does this new encryption entail?
(No additional performance hit if SSL does it, I know.)
Are you considering having different protocols for SSL-protected
transactions versus unprotected ones?
Let me repeat something I said a couple of weeks ago:  I suspect
that the weakest point in DigiCash security is on the end-user's
own harddrive.  A malicious cracker could write a Trojan horse
or even a virus which would steal the user's coins and send them
to himself.
Hm.  Now that I think about it, if the user has a back-up copy
of those coins then he can reveal their blinding factors to the
bank after the theft, thus catching the thief!  So the thief
program would have to deposit those coins with the bank, make a
new withdrawal (ouch!) and then steal the new coins.
I'm not sure that anything can be done by DigiCash or by Ecash-
issuing banks to prevent this, but I thought I'd mention it.
(Hm.  The program also has to steal the user's password in order
to make the withdrawal..  This is getting to be a pretty smart
