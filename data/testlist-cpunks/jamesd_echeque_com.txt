Eventually people will bypass the banks, directly transferring funds
to each other.  This will reduce the banks fees to zero.  The
banks will gradually lose control of the indecently lucrative funds transfer business, and have to go to the bread and butter business of borrowing short and lending long, and evaluating credit worthiness, and providing guarantees of payment.

@_subject: Euro Comm Adopts Privacy Directive (NewsClip) 
This is an even greater threat to privacy and rights than it appears.  In addition to the fact that enforcing such a law in a world where everyone has computers would require massive government intrusion, one must also consider the objective, the intent of such a law.   The intent of course is to limit what
we are permitted to know of each other.
In a world where contracts are largely enforced by reputations, (for example your visa card), governments can suppress freedom of contract by suppressing what information is available.  For example bankruptcy laws that violate freedom of contract are in part enforced by controlling what information credit bureaus are permitted to keep.  Indeed such restrictions are the major goal
of existing restraints on credit bureaus.
So not only does this law require extensive violation of freedom and privacy, the intent is also violation of peoples rights.
Both ends and the necessary means are, as usual, similar.
In the long run I do not think such laws can be effective unless governments use the same means to suppress privately computer mediated communication as the Chinese Empire used to suppress private paper mediated communication.  (The Chinese not only made paper a state monopoly, but they also castrated anyone with knowledge of paper making so that the knowledge would not be passed from father to son.)
This very vigorous enforcement did not hold back the tide for ever, but it held it back for a long time.

@_subject: Shared secrets and corporations in Cyberspace. 
How can collective entities hold keys?
Corporations derive their cohesion partly from realspace coercion, and
partly by trust based on face to face interactions among the participants,
and partly from their brand name.  Trusts derive their cohesion primarily
from trust, again based on face to face interaction.
A cyberspace corporation would derive its cohesion primarily from its name
identification and the public key associated with its brand name.  Consumers
would presumably wish there financial instruments to be signed to the public
key of Megacorp life insurance, rather than Megacorp's insurance saleman,
for fear that otherwise their funds might go astray, or they might get bad
software, etc, and the private key corresponding to that public key will
sign the employees paycheques.
If a cyberspace corporation does not have a valued brand name it is likely
to disintegrate into its components, in the way that some realspace
corporations did in the boisterous early days of silicon valley.
But this creates a problem of "owning the corporation". If one man knows the
corporations secret key, he can pretty much tell the shareholders to go take
a hike.  If two men know the secret key, it probably will not remain secret
much longer.
One solution is to use truenames, rather than keys as the "real identity" --
set up financial transaction software so that it considers that any key
signed by a proper authority certifying the key to be the key of Megacorp is
a valid Megacorp key, that all such keys are equivalent, and that the
authority will only issue keys to one entity called Megacorp.  Then when
folk start fighting over who is the real Megacorp, the authority resolves
the dispute by conventional means.
Current proposals for transaction software are based on truenames and
trees-of-trust.  This is not too bad as long as we have a forest, not a
single tree, but still, one would like to have some arrangement whereby a
large number of people could share a single key, and can buy and sell
interests in that key, whereby we can have the mechanisms of shared
ownership without the need for an external authority to enforce it.
Obviously trusts will work fine in Cyberspace, but trusts are by their
nature small and undemocratic.

Crypto relevance -- slight.
During the entire period that Moore's law has been in effect, we have used
light to print the wafers.
Now, with phase shifting masks in billion dollar fabs, we are reaching the
absolute limits of light.  If we go up to higher frequencies, we lose
refraction, and phase shifting fails.  Refractable light craps out at about
.3 to .15 microns.  Intel is currently at .35 microns.
There will be a slight hiccup or a major hesitation in Moore's law as the
fabs switch to a non optical printing process.
Current contenders are:
* Synchrotron radiation  (twenty billion dollar fabs, or worse.)
* ions  (fab price jumps a few times higher than current fab price.)
* electrons (no great escalation in fab price, but a radical drop in
production rates)
* flexible direct contact.  (fab price goes way down, back to producing ICs
in your garage.)
The flexible direct contact method has enough horsepower to take us all the
rest of the way down merge with biotech and to produce wires one atom thick

I will be greatly relieved when this happens.
I would be even more relieved if Netscape were to take action
to make it more difficult for the government to introduce GAK.
He did both less than that and considerably more than that:
Instead of trying to persuade us that he was against GAK, he sought
to persuade the reader that the reader should be against GAK.  He
sought to make it difficult for both a future Microsoft and a future
government to introduce GAK.
He described GAK in accurate language, rather than euphemistic terms.
He did not editorialize "GAK is bad" but any reasonable person reading his book, unfamiliar with crypto and the controversy, would conclude from the facts that he presented that GAK is a radical violation of the fourth amendment -- He described GAK in neutral, factually accurate language that doubtless deeply
offended the folks at NSA.
"Mandatory key escrow" is still an oxymoronic euphemism.
It is not escrow if the valuable item is held by someone who is party to the potential conflict, or subject to the power of someone who is party to the potential conflict.
Even to those of us who know what the euphemism "mandatory key
escrow" stands for, it still does not sound nearly as
threatening and scary as "government access to keys".

Jim Clark's  supposedly anti GAK statement was incomprehensible to me.
Perhaps he needs a punchier ghostwriter:
I offer my services free of charge.  :-)
If Jim Clark wishes to persuade us that his heart is in the right
place, he should put something like the following somewhere on the
Netscape web pages:
    "Our customers do not want government access to
     their cryptographic keys.  Mandatory government
     access to keys violates the rights of our
     customers.  Therefore we will not foist
     government access to keys on those customers
     who have freedom to communicate securely.
     We will only build government access to keys
     into our products for those customers whose
     governments force them to provide such access.
    "
If that really is Netscape's policy, then they should tell the world
that that really is Netscape's policy, thus instantly relieving the
fear, uncertainty, and doubt created by the unfortunate widespread
misinterpretation of Jim Clark's original statements.

If we stick to a lesser goal -- constancy of identity -- this is not so hard.  In general it is impossible to prove that Bryce is the "real" Bryce, but it is trivial to prove that Bryce is the same Bryce who has a certain Web page, and the
same Bryce who posted a certain article in archives.
We should blow off this attempt to do the impossible.

Perhaps this is partly because things tightened up, but
it is also that most US banks have developed a monolithic and obstructionist bureaucracy that is incapable of handling any event that is out of the ordinary.
By and large, over the past twenty years, there has been a decisive move towards financial management by guys who could not find their ass with both hands.
US banks simply do not work well for international transactions.

If the recipient verifies the coin regularly, then the cost of verification is still the same as ever.
Another poster earlier suggested the following solution, which seems
to me much better:  When you access the home page of the Playboy dirty pictures web site, you automatically buy a bunch of seemingly random numbers from them:  Every time you click on a URL, you spend one or more of their numbers.  If you have some left over when you are through, you can keep them or cash them.
This would mean two expensive transactions (high calculation and communication costs) per provider, instead of one expensive transaction
per click.
It also means that providers could make their tokens as cheap or expenisive
as they wished, down to microcents if they felt so inclined.
It also means that every shop around the world would be issuing their own money, making it impossible to trace anything in practice
even if everything was traceable in principle.

Any attempt to discuss and analyze reputations using

winded meaningless complicated word salad.
You will wind up in the same place as the behaviorists did,
going in ever diminishing epistemological circles until you
vanish into the whichness of why and the whyness of which.
Some things, for example reputations, behavior, or the principle of mathematical induction, necessarily involve concepts that are philosophically problematical.   Any attempt
to discuss these things while avoiding philosophically
problematic concepts invariably degenerates into total fog.

@_subject: towards a theory of reputation 
Under current circumstances, where we have a large oversupply of
free government supplied retributive violence, the most important
from of reputation is "credit rating", which indicates willingness
to pay ones legitimate debts and perform contracts.
Willingness to fulfill ones obligations is not at all the same thing as
willingness to act in a way that improves other peoples utility.
Fulfilling an obligation assumes normative criteria.  Any
attempt to describe credit worthiness in terms of its effect
on the utility of creditors misses the point.  Before the nineteenth century, when most governments were reluctant
to provide adequate retributive violence, and were more concerned
with collecting taxes than upholding law and order, the most important form of reputation was the reputation for being a "gentleman" which encompassed both willingness to pay ones just debts and "gentle" conduct, gentle conduct meaning that you were unlikely to kill or harm people without good reason,
but did not require that you went around performing good works.
Now if someone has a reputation for good workmanship, this might
seem non normative, but such a reputation is a mixture of two components:  "X has good quality products" which is not normative
and is a fact rather than a reputation, because it does not involve a prediction of future behavior" and "X will fulfill the spirit and intention of a contract" which is a reputation, and is normative.
For example although in principle X might have simultaneously have
reputation for good workmanship and a reputation for not paying his debts and not delivering on contracts, such a combination would seem unusual and surprising.

If you have looked at court cases recently, you will notice that most juries will find a corporation guilty of anything, no matter how absurd.  At a gut level they feel that the pursuit of profit is itself a crime, and that the pursuit of profit in an organized group is a flagrant and terrible crime, deserving of the most savage punishment, unless that pursuit has been thoroughly and carefully supervised and authorized by the state.
They are much more reluctant to punish an individual, which is why
the government wants to keep Phil in permanent legal limbo.

I suggest a few requirements:
Store the keys, and information about the keys in a *real* database
(for windows apps, we can redistribute the Microsoft access and or
the paradox database engines royalty free, and drive them through ODBC to minimize dependency on specific vendors.)
Support tree of authentification:  A key that is *named* Peter by Sam,  or *named* Informix Corporation by the Delaware corporate registrar, shall
be considered equivalent to any other key given the same name by same

This last property is essential if PGP keys are to be used as a
basis for exchanging promises to pay and directives to pay.
A very common use of this feature, pending the development of
user friendly software that makes every man is own bank and his
own credit rating agency, would be as follows:  Sam generates a long
key on a clean off line computer:  He uses it to name itself Sam and to
name several shorter keys "Sam".  He then puts the private long key on a floppy disk and buries it in a hole in the ground along with his gold and his stash of SKS ammo, and most likely never uses
it again.  He publishes the long public key, and uses
the shorter private keys for actual encryption.  From time to time, he changes keys, without any disruption or inconvenience.

@_subject: WTO an even worse possibility as Inet regulator 
This is excessively paranoid:  The main threat to freedom is still
internal, rather than external.
The major expansion of WTO power came because of the notorious
corruption and one sidedness of American courts judging disputes
between foreign and American businessmen.
Since WTO courts do not have WTO gunmen this amounts to a major
separation of judicial and executive power, thus though it is
a centralizing move, it is also a move that favors liberty an
the rule of law.
Of course the first stages in centralization always do, at first,
favor liberty and the rule of law as they restrain corrupt and
lawless local powers.  Later, much later, the centralized power
becomes a greater threat to liberty than those local authorities
that it restrained.  That stage is still a long way down the track, and very likely the modern nation state will collapse first.

Our function lust, if fullfilled, would give us more power over computers. Their function lust, if fullfilled, would give them more power over us.

been closed down, or suffered layoffs, merely because its function became completely obsolete.  (Though some have suffered renamings and reshuffles, and some have been allowed to shrink through natural attrition)

Popper went off the deep end because he tried to justify science

Bayesian probability.
A hopeless endeavor, like the attempt of the behaviorists to describe behavior without reference to intention, desire, and knowledge.
His reasoning leads logically to the polylogism of the

Bayesian probability leads us to the conclusion that some scientific theories have a probability of truth that is exponentially close to unity.

Maintain a 4K entropy buffer.
Mingle the exact time an place of each mouse hit into the entropy buffer using some combination that will have the effect of progressively shifting bits all over the place, so that every
noise bit that you get eventually effects every bit of the buffer in a
complicated way.
For example:
        Buf[p] = MouseNoise + Buf[p] + Buf[p-24] + Buf[p-55];
        p = p+1;
(See Knuth, SemiNumerical Algorithms, Book 2, page 27 for the magic properties of the numbers 24, 55.   This rule means that buffer immediately before p depends in a non linear fashion on all the noise you have received.)
Whenever you need a random number, take a one way checksum, for example MD5, of the most recently altered part of that buffer.  Use that as your random number. Whenever the user has used this buffer during a session, then when he quits netscape, save the buffer after first hashing To hash the buffer without loss of entropy, take the hash of one block of the buffer, and XOR it onto the next block (not the block that you hashed.)  Repeat for each block in the buffer cyclicly.

Assuming that MD5 loses no entropy, it is identical, or very similar in
strength, since in the algorithm that I described the most recently altered
part of the buffer depends sensitively on all previous noise accumulated
into the buffer, so if the total cumulated entropy is larger than your block
size, you are OK.
However the algorithm I described simply used less computation, but the
overhead of continually doing MD5 is probably modest. No matter what you do, if you cumulate a hundred bits of entropy, and if you
use a one way hash to generate random numbers so that your session keys do
not leak information about your entropy, you are going to be safe against a
random number generator attack.
I suggested accumulating a very large amount of entropy, but obviously this
is just gilding the lily.

Your use of the word random is incorrect:  The throw of a dice is random, but only contains 2.6 bits of entropy.
The windows VDT counter is very far from being random, but contains roughly sixteen bits of entropy.
This is old term of the art, a term of information theory:  We use the same word because entropy in information theory has the same measure as entropy in thermodynamics.
In both cases the entropy, measured in bits, of an ensemble of possible states is sum of  - P(i) * lg[P(i)] over all the possible states.

Your RNG number must of course be based on the full seed, not on

Similarly there is an awful lot of other stuff that is left wide

\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE Permissions on this are usually set to give every use write access, so that

reset their registry key to exclude write access by anyone other than
the administrator or the person installing the program, as a result any
user can muck with the environment of any program installed by any other user.
As a result any user can force feed most programs strings which the program would ordinarily assume are internally generated, and can therefore
be trusted.  A low privilege user can muck with the internals of a program
installed by a high privilege user.
This of course is a bug in the installation programs, rather than a bug in the operating system, but it is an almost universal bug.

It will obstruct contracts of the form "Anne promises to provide numbers with certain cryptographic properties, provided Bob provides

With RSA crypto cash, Anne can construct a blinded unsigned coin, and ask Bob to have it signed.  For this to be reasonably convenient

Suppose Alice generates an unsigned coin, blinds it, and shows Bob the
usigned, blinded coin.
Bob then has the bank sign it, and gives the signature to Alice.  If we use RSA to sign the coin, Alice now knows she has a valid coin, because she can verify the coin herself without needing to
show it to the bank.  So Bob has paid Alice some money, and nobody can double spend the coin, because Alice, and only Alice, knows the blinding factor.
So Alice does *not* need to check with the bank.
Alice cannot do this with your protocol, so we cannot have payee anonymity with your protocol.

When somebody proposes a bet that is substantially larger than

If somebody proposes a bet that is larger than the likely reputation cost of weaseling, we should ignore the bet and subtract from the guys reputation as if he had already weaseled, since the events of the extropian list show that that is the most likely outcome.

By this argument the Soviet Empire could never fall.
Governments are rarely overthrown.  Rather, they collapse.
Governments continually struggle to maintain cohesion. Sometimes they fail.  They do not naturally have cohesion.  A government is not naturally a single thing, not an entity by nature, the way a person is an entity by nature.
False on two counts:   First "frenzy" is exactly the opposite of what the government needs to stay in one piece, to continue to be a government.
Secondly, when you cut of someones air supply, they do not necessarily defend themselves.
I think I may have reported in cypherpunks my little experiment in Cuba when I cut off a cop's air supply, to test my hypothesis that even the cuban cops have a slave mentality.
People frequently fail to defend themselves, when suitably intimidated, and this is basically what governments rely upon.  If governments have to start
pulling guns all the time, they will fall.

Does anyone have any experimental information comparing an untamped high explosive with a pipe bomb?
A pipe bomb is a device for getting a decent explosion
out of a low explosive, such as gunpowder.
A low explosive combusts relatively slowly.  The purpose
of the pipe is to hold it together for long enough to get
decent pressure.
Homemade low explosives tend to be even more feeble than manufactured low explosives, because it is inadvisable
for amateurs to recorn their powder, with the result that
home made powders burn slow, whereas homemade high
explosives are just as effective as manufactured high My theoretical expectation is that pipe bombs would be very ineffectual when compared to high explosives, especially using home made powders.
Note that very large pipe bombs can be made by using propane cylinders or compressed gas cylinders in place of pipes.

Indian engineers typically get
one tenth or less of what European programmers get.
Many companies, for example Informix, have campuses here and
there across the USA, a campus in India, and several campuses
in Europe.  These campuses are linked by private televideo
connections, private voice mail systems, and the internet.
So theoretically a programmer in India should be much the same
to them as a programmer anywhere else.  Why should they care
where he lives.
Yet these companies continually spend vast sums of money on
politicians, lawyers, and perhaps bureaucrats, in
order to get their engineers out of India, so that they can pay
them more than ten times as much in some foreign country.
Informix has facilities in the US that are staffed mostly by Indians.  Why did it not leave these teams in India, where they would cost less than a tenth as much?
Clearly therefore, the same man is more than ten times as
valuable to them when he is not in India.
Since the communications are pretty much the same wherever he
is located, what makes the difference?
The power of the Indian government over that man and his work
makes the difference.
That man is poor because he is more subject to the power of the
state, which values him no more than any other expendable
slave, than he is contractually subject to those who value what
he can do.
Crypto relevance?
When the crypto economy gets going, and government interference
in the exchange of specialized labor becomes less effective, we can expect to see a radical rise in the standard of living.

However more capital, relative to labor, influences demand, and more

But in practice, the mobility of capital and the importance of labor
is such that this has little effect.  How much capital do you need
to provide a job for a software engineer?  The major determinant of someones value on the international market is who has coercive power over him, not the national supply of capital. Capital does not

You are wrong, and Perry is wrong, or rather you are misleading,
and Perry is wrong.
The statement "wages depend on the amount of capital invested". can have several meanings.  In the hands of the Austrians, it does not have the implications that you force on it, and this is what Perry ought to be complaining about,
though instead he is saying something quite different.
Obviously if everyone saves more money and invests it those
things that they find most profitable, this will raise both
total income and wages.
Obviously if the government takes control of other peoples
capital, and directs it to those places it finds most socially desirable, this will lower both total income
and wages.   I assume we are in agreement so far.
Next question:  If the government restrains american businessmen
from investing outside America, will this alter the balance of
power between capital and labor inside America, in favor of labor,
while altering it against labor outside America.
Well if nothing else changed, yes it would, and if Perry denied
this he was wrong.
But of course capital is international, because it belongs to individuals, not to nations.  Since large amounts of money flow
in and out of the US, a bureaucratic intervention that
aimed to have the desired effect would have to be extensive
and drastic, amounting to fascist style socialism.
Again, I assume we are in agreement on this.
Next question:
     Competition between labor in the third world, and labor in      the US.
In those cases where labor is a minor factor in production, then the price of labor would be dominated by the cheapest source of labor.
Or rather the cheapest source of labor that is not controlled
by a government that capriciously robs and enslaves.  At present
the cheapest such labor source is probably Thailand, which is not
actually all that cheap these days, but is one hell of a lot cheaper
than the US.
But for *desirable jobs*, such as software engineering, the jobs
that people are getting excited about, the cost of labor in Thailand
is roughly comparable to the cost in America.
The kind of jobs that are being taken by cheap unskilled Thai labor,
are the jobs you cannot get anyone to do in America except for illegal immigrants.
We would expect this, because in any area where labor is the dominant
factor of production (such as engineering) a large supply of cheap labor will very swiftly CREATE the necessary capital.
Again, you might point to India as an infamous counter example, since
engineering labor is vastly cheaper in India.
But this is not a result of supply and demand causing an extreme misdistribution of wealth between capital and labor, but is a reflection of
the fact that an engineer who is subject to the power of the Indian
government is not worth very much, as is demonstrated by the fact
that companies with Indian engineering teams often spend a lot of money
to get their employees out of India.
Demand for Indian programmers is less than supply not because capital
has somehow failed to flow to India, but because an engineer in India
is not free to produce the value that engineers elsewhere are free
to produce.
To say the same thing another way:  The primary capital for engineers
is that held within engineers heads.  Therefore controls on capital
flows are controls on engineers, which are likely to benefit those doing the controlling, not those controlled.

So?  What does this have to do with the price of fish?
Are Informix campuses "highly decoupled economies".
The fact is a company like Informix has a campus in India, and
it has campuses in the US that are largely staffed by Indian teams,
and it will pay big bucks to get its people out of India, even
though it has to pay them more than ten times as much in the US.
An Indian programmer doing the same job for the same company is
more than ten times as valuable to that company if he is not subject to the power of the Indian government, as proven by that
companies actions.
Plainly Informix does not like the power of the Indian government,
which is no surprise as a few years ago just about every company on

not touch the place with a ten foot pole.

That was not an explanation, that was mystic word salad.  It would be an explanation if wealth mysteriously rained
from the sky, rather than was produced by men.
In fact what gets sent to the Indian campus is largely legacy
work, which is in large part precisely the work that requires the closest contact with the customer, contact with actual working conditions, and the like.
This seems to be a general practice, not just an Informix practice, for
in an article on "India's silicon valley" I read that the work done in
India was largely done on existing legacy apps, often in obsolete
languages and operating systems.
This is of course the work that places the least amount of the
companies intellectual assets in India, and thus the work that
gives the Indian government the least power over Informix and its
activities.  Informix could abandon the Indian campus and all
the intellectual assets on which it was working, and all the
physical assets located there, at any moment and not suffer any serious loss or inconvenience.

SCHOLARLY RESEARCH!!!!
You do not know shit from beans:  Alperovitz is no more a scholar than Zundel is:  He is a historical revisionist who lies even more crudely than the holocaust revisionists.
It is clear that in the opinion of the high command, the decision to surrender after they were nuked was a dramatic and radical change of position.  Alperovitz says otherwise, thus he is either grotesquely ignorant or, more likely simply dishonest.
         The use of the atomic bomb, most experts now believe, was totally
        unnecessary. Even people who support the decision for various         reasons acknowledge that almost certainly the Japanese would have
        surrendered before the initial invasion planned for November.         The U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey stated that officially in 1946.         We found a top-secret War Department study that said when the         Russians came in, which was August 8, the war would have ended         anyway. The invasion of Honshu, the main island, was not         [And so on and so forth]
After the second nuclear attack, the Japanese high command had a
meeting with the emperor:  They heard testimony on the effects of
atomic bombs.  About half wanted to surrender, about half argued that
Japan should die gloriously:  They were unaware that the US had just
used up almost its entire nuclear arsenal.  They expected that surrender
would be followed by the same kind of reign of terror, rape, brutal
degradation, and mass murder, that they inflicted on the people that
they conquered. They expected that failure to surrender would result
in continued nuclear bombardment at about the same rate.  (Both
beliefs were incorrect.)
The Emperor *at that meeting* made the decision to surrender, shocking
a large part of the high command, and then made a speech on radio
announcing the surrender, stating as reason for the surrender that if
they did not surrender, Japan would be utterly destroyed by nuclear
Seeing as they were still debating the issue *after* two nuclear
weapons had landed on them, it seems reasonable to believe that
without atomic weapons, it would have been necessary to fight from
house to house from one end of Japan to the other.
When Hirohito ordered surrender in response to atomic bombing, the high command attempted to violently overthrow him, and when they failed, many
in the high command committed suicide.

After the first nuclear bomb was dropped, the Japanese government
held a cabinet meeting in which they summoned Nishina, head of the
atomic program, and asked him if he could duplicate atomic weapons
within a few months.
After two nuclear weapons had been dropped on Japan, the cabinet concluded
that Japan faced utter destruction with nuclear weapons, and some advocated
surrender.  But according to emperor Hirohito
   "At the time of the surrender, there was no prospect of agreement"
Even with two nuclear weapons, surrender was far from assured.  It was touch
and go:  Had the coup succeeded, Japan would not have surrendered, and a considerably more nuclear bombing would have been necessary.  The bullet
holes in the imperial palace testify that even after two nuclear bombs,
there was a substantial faction of the government determined not to surrender.
It was certainly true that Japan was defeated, and reasonable people may
disagree on justice of using nuclear weapons under these circumstances, but
to claim, as Alperovitz claims, that Japan was on the verge of surrender, is not a mere difference of opinion on the interpretation of the facts, but
a simple, crude, barefaced, blatant lie.

Secondly if you were able to get that, it would be even worse than the what you will actually get.
If you have one law for men who run businesses and one law other folks, then we have selective enforcement and application of the laws, that enables governments to act selectively and capriciously.

No pretence.  It is, and it has been for some time.
Your other arguments casually dismiss the very real power that large numbers of able people with good communications can exercise, have just exercised
very recently.
Nation states are a new creation.  In the past many different kings ruled many different bits of one nation, and one king often ruled parts of more than one nation.
Today nation states are almost universal, and people can no longer imagine what a nation is, other than a nation state.  But the net is a nation, and is not a state, and nationalism is a force that governments usually cannot withstand.
What makes a government strong is its cohesion, but the state cannot
create its own cohesion.  When states attempted to confront nationalism, they often lost cohesion and vanished altogether, like a string of sand. The "Nation state" is in essence a tactic for avoiding this hazard.
Governments are acutely aware of this problem, and act very cautiously in the face of such threats.  Many people seem to imagine that a government innately and naturally has cohesion, that it is naturally one thing, naturaly capable of acting coherently and cohesively as an individual can.  On the contrary, governments maintain their cohesion with difficulty, and continually act, or refrain from acting,
in fear that they might lose it.
In an all out knock down battle between a particular government and the
internet, in a state where a substantial proportion of the middle class
was on the internet, the government would be in serious danger of evaporating like a jellyfish in the sunshine.
The government can get away with a substantial amount of harassment and restraint, but has only limited power to act without itself being acted on, to change the world without itself suffering change.

You delete my arguments, and then say:  "I am not willing to take this on

During the American revolution, the British troops could go where they
pleased, and destroy whatever they wished, but they could not obtain
political control by so doing.
Yes, we are vulnerable, and so are they.  If they used the measures
proposed by Strata, the measures proposed by Jim Bell would gather wide support.
Ob Crypto:
They cannot obtain political control by mere acts of destruction, because they cannot be sufficiently selective in who they silence.
For destruction to be effective, you must not only harm those who oppose
you, you must refrain from harming those who do not oppose you.  The
destructive acts proposed by Strata conspicuously fail to do this.
Under the extreme conditions that Strata envisages, the measures proposed by Jim Bell would be effective in obtaining politically desired consequences,
because they are selective and targeted, and the measures that Strata fears
would be ineffective in obtaining the politically desired consequences, because they are unselective and untargeted.

3.  Such a law as you propose, without prior restraint, would not violate peoples privacy, and for that very reason it is vastly unlikely that such a law would ever be passed.  The primary purpose
of laws against acts that are malum prohibitum and not malum in se is to empower those that pass them, and the secondary purpose is

An amplification mechanism will usually couple the signal to the vacuum, and introduce vacuum noise.   Another way of thinking of vacuum noise is that amplification mixes the state of the signal, with the (unknown) phase of the universe at infinity.
Of course any statement in words about quantum mechanics is necessarily false, so the above statement is a metaphor or parable, rather than literal

When printing was introduced in the west, the big print crackdown was successful, but there was great resistance, and the crackdown on the printed word required great and continuing violence over a long period, and was never entirely effective.
A net crackdown will be substantially less effective than the print crackdown was, and the level of violence is likely to be greater.
There is of course a tradeoff:  An highly ineffectual net crackdown will not provoke large scale resistance.  They can probably force

@_subject: NSA says strong crypto to China? 
I see no sign that NSA is capable of distinguishing between the interest of the state and the interest of the nation.
It is perfectly clear that the threat that NSA is primarily concerned with comes from within, not from without.
There is this big myth, spread partly by the US government, and partly by the radical left, notably Chomsky, that the US has been protecting the world against socialism:  This is a load of old bananas.  The US government has been pro socialist -- not as pro socialist as the IMF, and the IMF has not been as pro socialist as the Soviets -- but the US has still been shoving socialism down peoples throats in a heavy handed way, because they could get away with that kind of stuff abroad, when they cop hell for it at home.
The nastiest piece of socialism was arguably the land reform
scheme in El Salvador, which converted the peasants from
tenants of a few powerful rural landlords, to serfs on state
run collective farms.  This screwed up agriculture big time,
and the peasants detested it.
If you want to use land reform to make peasants into anti communists, you use the method so successfully used in Taiwan.  You make it possible for the peasant to buy land, and encourage him to buy land, and once he has some land of his own, and has sacrificed in order to obtain it, you can then trust him to resist communism.  If there are communist guerrillas around, you should give him a shotgun.
The US government followed a very different strategy in El Salvador, from which we may conclude that just as the South Vietnamese government considered that robbing
the Montagnards, and rendering them powerless and afraid was more important than resisting North Vietnamese communism, the US government similarly considered that suppressing private property, was more important than resisting communist infiltration in El Salvador.
El Salvador was vulnerable to communism because only two hundred
families owned everything worth owning.   If you want to prevent
communism the kind of land reform you need is land reform that
allows more people to acquire individual property rights.
I disagree.
Two government officials, one of whom is a communist, have more in common than two communists, one of whom is a government official.  The NSA is on the same side as the Chinese government,
and if Chinese dissidents used crypto with US GAK, this information
would be exchanged with the Chinese government.

@_subject: Censorship 
In the past, whenever a new medium came into play, the new medium was
subjected to extraordinarily restrictive censorship, while censorship was
radically relaxed, or abandoned altogether, on the old media.  Thus when the
talkies came in, censorship on books was relaxed.  When TV came in
censorship on movies was relaxed.  I conjecture that this represents the
power of vested interests, and the relative weakness of new interests.  Now
if this pattern is going to be repeated, we would expect the FTC to attempt
to utterly strangle the internet in a straightjacket, on behalf of the
television interests that have largely captured the FTC.
Note that current proposed legislation, legislation containing Exxon's
severe censorship rules, gives the FTC ownership of the internet.  They may
claim to own it.  Let us see them try.
Censorship on television is now much tighter than it used to be:  Expect a
radical relaxation when internet use starts to cut into television time.
Remember the original Star Treck:  Every episode would have a fistfight, a
gunfight, a space battle between starships with really cheap cheesy special
effects, Captain Kirk would dip his wick (off screen) in a new exotic alien
female, and he would defy orders, or Starfleet regulations, and most
regularly and spectacularly, he would violate the prime directive. In most
episodes a redcoat or two would be killed in a completely senseless and
unnecessary manner, illustrating the cold indifference of the universe, or
the casual evil of sentient beings.  Whenever they introduced a new
character with a red coat, you knew that violent death was on tonight's menu. Now consider the bland successor show "Star Treck the Next Generation":  In
a bow to political correctness they changed the words from "To boldly go
where no man has gone before" to "To boldly go where no one has gone
before". The "Next Generation" universe is socialist, and socialism is
boring.  Worse still, on "Next Generation" socialism actually works, and if
there is anything even more boring that actual real life socialism, it is
socialism that works because everyone cares about each other and they are
all such very nice people. Well it came to pass that our TV executives woke up to the fact that there
was something missing from the boring "Next Generation" universe, so they
shift their plots to less perfect places. In an upcoming science fiction series "Osiris" the story universe has social
collapse and reversion to barbarism, the exact opposite of the sickeningly
perfect "Next Generation" universe.  A logical continuation of the gimmick
they pulled in "Deep Space Nine" in order to get the story out from the
deadly grip of socialism.  So far so good.  But guess what? Nobody in the
"Osiris" story suffers violent death, and the bad guys reproduce asexually. Asexually!!  What would Captain Kirk do?
Probably sodomy.
And now let us consider the cartoons.  Remember Yosemite Sam with his fiery
temper and his two six guns?  Pow! Blam!
Well guess what?  In today's cartoons, Yosemite Sam has no guns!
Poor Captain Kirk.  Poor Yosemite Sam.
Under these circumstances we should expect a certain amount of friction
around such newsgroups as alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children,
alt.conspiracy, alt.sex.bestiality.barney, alt.nationalism.white, and so forth.
You will notice that political censorship goes hand in hand with censorship
of sex and violence:  Not only does Captain Whazisname of the "Next
Generation" and "Deep Space Nine" refrain from spreading his semen
indiscriminately across the galaxy and refrain from beating people up man on
man, he also obeys orders and regulations and never says anything that would
be controversial in his universe or ours.  They had to make Captain
Whazisname of "Deep Space Nine" black instead of the white Captain
Whazisname in "Next Generation" and young instead of old, because otherwise
nobody would have noticed that he was supposed to be different person,
played by a different actor.   Typical politically correct diversity:
Different colors, but only one voice.

About twenty or thirty years ago, there was big debate on in Australia
on whether Australia should have a bill of rights.
The natural rights crowd popped up from obscurity and vigorously opposed
a bill of rights.  They successfully argued that if a bill of rights were written down on paper, these rights would then become mere creations of the courts.  This same concern is voiced in Article nine
of the American bill of rights.
In my judgement, America is reasonably free despite having a bill of rights,
rather than because of a bill of rights.
The American nation derived its cohesion from the ideology of liberty, not
from a race or religion.  This is the reason America has a bill of rights,
and this is the reason it remains somewhat free despite possessing a bill
of rights.
Despite this debate and referendum in Australia, the government has been sneaking some rights into the Australian constitution by various stratagems, and I think that this will have the effect of
undermining liberty.

Not so:  If the message is encrypted and checksummed with a simple

MACs are only useful in the strange and unsual case where you want

You can find it at

A notable misfeature of the API is that it assumes that in general you will have two key pairs.  One for signing and one for encrypting.
Since in the most common case you are encrypting something related to a
signed message by the person you are encrypting to this is a
bad idea, and protocols that require two key pairs to avoid protocol
failure are hazardous and inconvenient.  I think Microsoft should not have chosen to support such protocols.
The Crypto engine that Microsoft will soon distribute in every copy of

issues, the more power and influence they get and the more funds

One of the great hazards with banking, and with financial services similar to banking, is that the financial institution has the opportunity to steal a great deal of money.
One solution to this problem is government auditors.  Government
inspectors, unlike private auditors, can force their way in, in
the early hours of the morning, and as each bank employee turns up,
take him to a separate cubicle and interogate him with a gun in
one hand and an account book in the other.  This makes it difficult
for the financial institution to fabricate a misleading picture of
its financial situation.
A hash tree can provide proof to a banks customers that the bank only
has the amount outstanding that it claims to have, without the need
for gunmen to check the totals.
At the close of month, the customer accounts are orgnized into a hash tree with the totals forming part of the hash
Each node is a hash of the two nodes below it, and the amounts of money in
the two nodes, and the sum of those two amounts.
Each customer can then see that the money the bank owes him is a part of
the total the bank claims to owe.  If a customer discovers he is not part of the hash tree, he knows the bank, or financial institution,
understates its indebtedness;
No auditors, government or otherwise, required.

@_subject: Microsoft's CryptoAPI - thoughts? 
I was concerned about a different issue:
Suppose you have some signed information:  You wish to send some encrypted
information to the person who wrote that signed information.
If the signing key and the encrypting key are the same, your software can
locally ensure that you encrypt with the right key, (The correct key is the
same public key that you used to check the signature on the message.)
If the signing key and the encrypting key are different, then in order to
ensure that you are not spoofed into using the wrong public key, the
whole protocol must work correctly, exposing many more points of attack, since key management is the most complex and most vulnerable area.

@_subject: Hash trees and bank solvency. 
I refer to actual practice, not to theory:  (Though the guns are only metaphorically held to peoples heads, the examiners forcing their way in at dawn and ambushing the senior employees as they arrive are entirely literal.)
The objective is to take them by surprise and interrogate them
separately, to avoid them "hiding" some customers and some
If the element of surprise is lost, the examiners are likely to
be confronted with truckloads of plausible, consistent, and entirely bogus documentation, as happens regularly.
Of course a broker's opportunity to pull this kind of fraud is less
than a banks, because his customers will generally hold diverse
stocks.  Suppose the broker has embezzled some IBM stocks.  Then he will have to leave out some customers that own IBM stocks
from his record keeping.   But this will frequently result in
inconvenient excesses of other stocks and unexplained transactions
in other stocks, thus the needed book shuffling is more elaborate and inconvenient than that of a bank.
But it only requires one customer to discover the failure in
in a cryptographic tree, whereas to discover the failure in
the method of book keeping you describe, we have to be sure
we have covered all customers, and we have to be sure that
they receive the same information that the auditor does, and how
can one ensure that, except by the dawn raid method?
That is what software is for:  The task would of course have
to be done by financial software, not done by hand.
Set up the protocols so that software that verifies the hash tree
generates certificates that are proof that you are eligible to
receive the money, and software that does not, cannot generate
provably valid certificates.
Then if the institution comitts the fraud you describe, the ill
informed customers who use the rigged software get stiffed, as they cannot easily prove that they were owed, and the better informed customers do not get stiffed.
Notice that the above system requires that the banking software
be supplied independently and separately from the bank.
Customer expertise will improve dramatically after the first fraud,
much as computer security improves dramatically after the first

@_subject: Style gettting in the way of clear reporting 
Believe it or not, this has some very slight cypherpunk relevance.  (Gasp)
When news media were concentrated into fewer and fewer hands during the twentieth century, the appearance of neutrality, objectivity, and authoritativeness became a major selling point, and so media adopted a tone and manner of neutrality, with an accompanying "just-the-facts" style, though in reality they became far less neutral
Now that everyone can grab the megaphone, people are not so worried
about objectivity.  If something is unfair to Nazis or blacks or evil
polluting capitalists, they know they will hear about it from the Nazis, the blacks or the evil polluting capitalists.
As a result, people no longer value the superficial appearance of neutrality and objectivity.  Suddenly colorful and openly biased reporting has become popular.  This has led to some people engaging in florid excesses of colorful style and concocting totally phony attitudes., just as when word processing programs first gained the capability to handle a wide variety of fonts, some people produced memos that looked like ransom notes.
Soon enough they will settle down.  English prose was at its greatest in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when many voices could be heard, and some of them were on the florid side.

We mostly see terrorism in countries with a large and intrusive government,
not in countries like Hong Kong where there is massive government "neglect"

than by the murder of women and children.

But here we run into the paradox, that it is not in each persons self
interest to pursue is self interest.
Example;  Suppose only two are left:  Then No. 19 get everything, and No. 20 gets nothing.  So if only three are left, it will maximize 20's return to vote for a proposal by number 18, that number 18 gets 19,999,999 dollars, and number 20 gets one dollar
But suppose that number 20 announces in advance that he considers
an unequal division morally wrong, and will always vote against
any unequal division.  If this threat is credible, which it is,
number 18 will have no choice but to propose an equal split, so
number 20 now gets 6,666,666 dollars, instead of one dollar.
Now if number 20 had threatened to vote against any proposal that
did not split the money equally between himself, and number 18,
thus going for ten million instead of six million, this threat
would be less credible, and he would very likely have wound up
with one dollar.
This is a particular example of the various well known paradoxes
of utilitarianism, that utility is maximized by a firm and credible
promise to utterly disregard utility maximization.

As usual you display profound ignorance of history and politics.
Far from being an ahistorical myth, this is an entirely accurate description

Like someone who cannot resist looking at a dreadful traffic
accident, I continue to participate in this Detweiler inspired
Fascism is of course a reasonably complete, coherent, and philosophically consistent logical system, almost as coherent as marxism, and far more logical than Mill's utilitarianism.  It was published and thoroughly debated well before they pursued or took power.
Rich Graves's lie is a lie I frequently hear from those who well know the truth, Many of my readers will think I am excessively harsh, calling Rich
Graves a liar rather than a fool, but I hear the above story (that fascism is not a coherent ideology or philosophy) primarily from
those whose interests this story serves, and if they genuinely thought this story was true, they would not know that it is in their
interests to push it.
Therefore one may reasonably conclude that most who push this story
are knowingly lying, that it is a widespread lie, not a widespread
fallacy or an alternate interpretation of the truth.
I mostly hear it from those whose economic ideology strongly resembles fascism, or those whose philosophy is directly descended from fascism, is in fact fascist philosophy.  Rich's economic ideology does not seem to resemble fascism, so I would guess he is in the second category
but not the first.  Most PC folk are postmodernists, poststructuralists,
deconstructionists, etc, which philosophies directly descend from fascist philosophy, and he seems to be PC, so this would explain his peculiar
assertion above.
Not only do such concepts as feminist science, phallocentric science, etc, strongly resemble such concepts as aryan science, jewish science, etc, but they are justified using the same arguments from the same philosophers.  Indeed Heidegger was not only a philosopher of fascism, but he personally participated in Hitler's terror, terrorizing his academic
colleagues, and Paul De Man of Yale University worked directly for the Nazis as a propagandist in occupied Belgium.
Hence the frequent lie by those who share this monstrous philosophy, that the fascists had no philosophy.

@_subject: [NOISE] "Fascism is corporatism" 
[A whole bunch of totally irrelevant boring distractions, amongst them]:
To argue that fascism has no philosophy without mentioning Maurice Barres is
nearly as silly as arguing that communism has no philosophy without mentioning
Marx.  If you delete all reference to Fascist philosophers, you will of course
come to the conclusion that fascism has no coherent philosophy.
Fascism got its epistemology from Barres, and its economic theory from Sorel.
Your argument is analogous to someone who argues that communism had no coherent philosophy by talking about Mao as if he had popped out of nowhere, and failing to mention Marx and Lenin.
In my opinion the most coherent fascist philosopher that preceded the fascist rise to power was Maurice Barres. (Of course once fascism was on the rise, you got a bunch more fascist philosophers, most of them way to the left of Barres.) This thread in philosophy has continued to the present day, though it was abruptly renamed after the defeat of Hitler.  Barres's arguments are logically and philosophically coherent, and are clearly and unambiguously recognizable as the epistemology, and much of the claptrap and rhetoric of fascism, and as the epistemology, and much of the claptrap and rhetoric of modern PC, and we can trace the philosophical thread connecting modern PC to Barres through known Nazi philosophers who not merely philosophized, but also participated actively in Hitler's regime, and to direct and immediate disciples of those philosophers, such as Derrida.
Perhaps I was elliptical in the above.  I will restate:
The claim that fascism lacks an economic program and/or a philosophy comes primarily from those whose economic program and/or philosophy bears a
marked resemblance to fascism.   If they were not aware of this resemblance
they would not so vigorously seek to redefine fascism as military dictatorship, racism, etc.
This leads me to doubt the basic human honesty of those who push this line,
and their concern for human lives.
Revisionism alert:  I just deleted vast chunks of text from your message above where you presented negative evidence that fascism had no philosophy, and I was just thinking that maybe I had overdone it and would get flamed for deleting arguments rather than answering them.
Revisionism alert:
Tim gave a perfectly correct definition of corporatism, and you then
proceeded to give a very similar definition, and you then proceeded to smear Tim by falsely implying that he gave a silly ignorant definition, radically different to the one he did in fact give.
You also have carefully avoided mentioning Sorel, who of course advocated roughly the economic problem that Mussolini attempted to implement, that
Hitler did implement, and that Timothy May condemned, long before Mussolini
got of the ground.  Sure sounds like an economic ideology to me.
Yeah, right, And the only fifty thousand jews were murdered.  :-)
Historical Revisionism alert:  The above is wildly implausible:  You do not call Nazism a disease in Nazi Germany and live to tell of it, let alone call Nazism a disease and get appointed to the important and well paid job of terrorizing your academic colleagues.
The above is also infamously false:  As rector, Heidegger denounced those of his colleagues he wished murdered as jews, including his own teacher, and he organized paramilitary camps for his students, spouting martial rhetoric about the "inner truth and greatness of National Socialism," see citation below.
Historical Revisionism alert:  See  for how he is REALLY Heidegger himself claimed at the time, his political activities grew out of his philosophy, and this claim seems to me to be very obviously true.
Indeed what he claimed then is equivalent to what I have been telling you in
public and private email:  That your ideas lead to people being murdered by
the state, and therefore you should consider them more carefully.
Historical revisionism alert:
His most infamous work was his laudatory speech on Hitler given when he was appointed rector of Freiburg.  In addition he never disowned his works on the "jewish problem".  As rector he imposed Nazism on his colleagues by the usual means.
The fact that Paul de Man's philosophy had a very strong resemblance to fascist philosophy was discovered considerably earlier.  The fact that he also wrote the kinds of racist propaganda that are no longer politically correct was merely the icing on the cake.
Revisionism alert (or perhaps in this case merely a reinterpretation alert):

A crypto-anarchist could mean either someone who seeks to destroy the state by higher mathematics, or someone who conceals his real aim of destroying
the state. Because cryptography is in many ways subtle attack on the state, with
far more radical than is at first apparent, those who seek to destroy the state by this means often are not obvious anarchists -- crypto-anarchists are often The intended meaning is usually obvious from context:  I have never seen the

This provision of the bill makes the entire bill a worthless pile of repressive shit, despite all the pious good intentions

A little constitutional history:
The supreme court used to rule that congress could not delegate its own power to bureaucrats, as this violated the principle of rule of law.
Thus congress could pass a law than in a certain situation you had to do such and such, or refrain from doing so and so, but it could not pass a law that in a certain situation you had to do whatever some bureaucrat told you to do, because that would violate separation of powers and the principle of the rule of law, not men.
Roosevelt threatened to stack the court, the court submitted, and the rule
of law in the US was radically diminished.
The proposed bill would seem to give bureaucrats the power to set aside the
first, fourth, and fifth amendments, at whim.

get five years for obstruction.   If the objectionable parts mean

In addition to eradicating everyone like me, they would also eradicate their
dupes, their useful fools, such as H.G. Wells, who wrote of Stalin:
    "[...] never met a man more candid, fair and honest, [...] no one is afraid
     of him and everybody trusts him.
    "
Since they did not give H.G. Wells a tour of the Gulag, I guess they suspected that he might not have approved.  Such a suspicion would doubtless have proved fatal had his pals amongst the Fabian socialists gained power.

The bill does not facilitate crypto exports, it just sounds like it does, and it delegates judicial powers to cops.
If it was amended to facilitate crypto exports, and to maintain the separation of judiciary and executive, it would not pass.

This is somewhat off topic for cypherpunks, but alt.forgery is dead, so

Suppose (hypothetically) an American resident cypherpunk had a hypothetical friend who is most unlikely to obtain an American visa.
Now the standard way of dealing with situation is for an American
friend to get a certified birth certificate of someone born in America, concoct some photo ID, send it to the out-of-America friend,
and then the out-of-America friend comes in through Montego Bay or
some similar point where there is lots of tourist traffic.
But the thought struck me that this might not work for some one

age and sex etc encoded on them, and conceivably they check them

Any suggestions?  Surely lots of people have dealt with this problem already.

One mechanism for encrypting RTP would be to construct a shared secret
key by DH exchange, or Rabin if one wished to dodge patents, construct
a cryptographically strong pseudo random data stream from the key, using
Ron's code, and for each RTP packet, encrypt using a block from that data stream as the packet key.

Politicians have their ear to the ground.  They are very much aware that the elite and the middle class are increasingly cynical about democracy and hostile to the corrupt poltical process, that many large groups see the government as unconstitutional and illegitimate, and see no hope or benefit in participation in politics.
The purpose of these bills is not to change who gets screwed, but
to draw those who are screwed back into the political process.

@_subject: Why does the state still stand: 
I intend to post this to a bunch of rant newsgroups.  It is the common
wisdom of cypherpunks:  Any corrections or objections?
   *************************************************************************
Why does the state still stand?
Now if the state had to compel everyone to write a check for ten thousand
dollars every quarter, or to make little trip to the IRS with a brown paper
bag full of hundred dollar bills, there would be massive tax resistance,
massive state violence to enforce taxes, and the many individual violent
conflicts with the state would swiftly become collective armed revolution. The state can get away with this extraordinary and exorbitant tax rate,
because for the most part it does not apply coercion directly to individual
people.  Instead it disrupts the large scale institutions that we have
created to facilitate large scale cooperation.
Now it is easy to coerce the transactions in physical marketplace, or a
physical large scale factory or office, because the state can easily find
the market place and see what people are doing in it, far easier than it can
find individual people and see what each person is doing overall, and if
people do not play by the state's rules it can easily send in the bad boys
to close down the marketplace.
Thus the state obstructs the large scale specialization of labor, and
charges us a high price to participate in that specialization.
The state can do this effectively because such specialization depends on
large numbers of people regularly meeting face to face in recognizable
physical places: company offices, stock exchanges, and the like.   The state
can extract this tax because it can send the bad boys into any such meeting
place and close it down. It is this, rather than direct coercion of taxpayers that enables it to
charge such savage and extraordinary taxes.  Any attempt to directly coerce
taxpayers on this scale would swiftly lead to rivers of blood.
Electronic marketplaces are less easy to coerce.  Note how states find
themselves largely powerless before the international money market.  This
has caused a substantial retreat of the state in many countries throughout
the world. The socialists complain because the World bank asks the Ukraine and Belarus
to be slightly less socialist, but the international money market will not
touch such governments with a ten foot pole, while it will roll over like a
puppy for governments such as Estonia and Tunisia which really are
dismantling socialism.
The challenge then is to move the meetings that make specialization of labor
possible to the net, thus making us less easy for the state to coerce.
The anarcho socialists have one half of an important truth: In order to
smash the state, we must first transform capitalism. Right now not much is happening.
Ecash today is rather like email eight years ago.  You had a bunch of email
systems none of which would talk to each other and none of which were very
easy to use and all of which cost too much.
Most good groupware, for example source code control programs, is designed,
perhaps intentionally, in ways that make it only useful for intranets, not
for WANs.  That is to say only useful inside the kind of corporations that
presently exist.  Also, to be useful in a post corporate economy, a source
code control tool would need to have better view control, since the boss
cannot simply announce.  "OK, we are now in alpha, so we shall now have
feature freeze on the product."  Instead somebody has to announce "I have
constructed and will maintain a feature frozen buildable source code view."
We would be vastly further ahead on PGP 3.0 and on ecash if we had a tool
like that.
How then did we solve the email problem?
The email problem was not a problem that big corporations were capable of
solving.  Whenever one network, such as Compuserv, negotiated with another
network, such as AOL they could never agree about settlements. How much
would compuserv charge AOL to deliver AOL customers mail to Compuserv
customers, and how much would AOL charge Compuserve to deliver Compuserve
customers mail to AOL customers.  And how would it be metered, and what
software standards would be used to enable the metering, and the lawyers
would talk to the accountants, and the accountants to the software guys, and
up and down the corporate hierarchy it would go, and back and forth between
Eventually, on the internet, the custom and expectation grew up that you did
not charge for delivering mail to your customers, largely due to the
influence, and the moral and political outlook, of the IETF.   Problem solved:  Nothing to negotiate;  Nothing to be metered.  Turned out
it was a moral and political problem, not a pricing problem.
Now right now we are in the same pickle with electronic transactions as we
once were with email.  We have a bunch of proprietary systems with
proprietary software and proprietary money that do not talk to each other. Worse, anonymous ecash is patented by Chaum.  This is an algorithm for how
people  structure promises to pay, and is therefor even less well suited to
be intellectual property than most software patents. As a result anyone who
wants to make an agreement with Chaum to implement anonymous electronic cash
faces a lot of cost and delay.  Such agreements are difficult to make and
What we need in addition to our existing electronic cash mechanisms is a
general mechanism for exchanging and transferring promises to pay, so that
Betty can exchange a promise by John to pay in system X for a promise by Sam
to pay in system Y.  Such a system must make every man their own bank and
their own credit agency, and must not be tied to any one proprietary
institution that issues promises to pay.
Now once we have that, it will cobble all the different ecash systems
together, just as the internet cobbled all the email systems together, and
we will start to make some real progress in moving the institutions that
facilitate large scale specialization of labor to the net.  Right now
nothing much is happening, despite the fact that several big names have
issued ecash systems.
Now in order to create such a system we need a patent free public key
system: (Rabin will be free from the DH patent in one year) and we need a
satisfactory public key management system, one that can couple to standard
databases.  Lots of folk are twiddling their thumbs waiting for Phil
Zimmermann to issue the PGP 3.0 key management system.  Possibly someone
will issue a PGP key management system that works with the Microsoft Crypt
API.   The Microsoft default key management system is crummy, and is limited
to keys small enough for the NSA to break.
So guys, that is the plan:  We destroy the state through higher mathematics.
We do this by replacing the current institutional mechanisms of corporations
with cryptographic mechanisms.  This will give more people the opportunity
to evade and resist taxes.

@_subject: Why does the state still stand: 
I expect that as corporations move to the net, they will not have the
highly centralized structure of existing corporations.  In any case
this structure is in large part imposed by the state in order to facilitate tax collection.  For example the existence of the "Human resources department" is largely the result of state coercion of corporations.  In web businesses ones primary relationship will be with ones immediate coworkers, rather than
the greater corporation.
They will consist rather of a network of relationships -- contracting
will move up, and the Keiretsu structure will move down.  I expect
the institutional structure will resemble that of the mafia -- a loose
confederation of networks rather than tight whole. Thus defection
by one party can only cause limited damage.
In my judgement the Keiretsu form of economic organization is growing in large part because of improved communications and lowered communication costs.
The Keiretsu form does not in itself facilitate tax evasion, but it
does mean that the state has to apply coercion more directly to
more people in order to collect taxes, and that its coercion has to be more visibly arbitrary and disruptive.
In order to do business, one will need a good name (or good nym).
If one does not have a good name, one will be poor.  That is why
I said "every man his own credit bureau".
Existing forms of ecash are costly and inconvenient, hence unsuitable
for spending in tiny quantities.  I expect that
in the not very distant future every shop will offer its own cash,

The major battle the net has faced is with the church of scientology.
In this battle the net is clearly in the right, and the church clearly
in the wrong, regardless of what copyright law says.  Retreat on
this issue would be politicaly inadvisable, for it would radically
weaken us in the next battle, which will doubtless concern much more
vital matters than a band of con men.
What do I need to do to support a remailer that posts to non binary
newsgroups? (I do not have root control on a unix machine other than my
employers machine, for which I am unlikely to receive approval to use in this fashion.)

Actually looting of companies happens a lot right now today, and very
seldom leads to criminal charges.  Twice I have lost a job because the
company I worked for went under, apparently due to looting.
At present venture capitalists seem to rely on the sniff-their-arses
method.  They talk to people and try and get a feel as to whether they
are planning a robbery.  This method is obviously likely to be less
effectual as businesses move to the net.
This problem is probably the major reason why Net startups are physically located in Silicon valley, rather than world wide or nation wide.  Of course
the problem is that if the venture capitalists can find them to sniff
their arses, the bad boys can also find them to shake them down.
In some businesses we can solve this problem by cryptographic control
mechanisms, such as open books banking.  In others, such as net startups,
I see no solution other than increased reliance on personal individual
Athenian capitalism worked largely on personal capital.  Because of their
terrible arithmetic system, bookkeeping was really bad, and in consequence
stock investments tended to go sour.  Socrates lost a bundle in this fashion, which may explain his lack of enthusiasm for capitalists.
It will work for many particular cases of this problem.

An organization, such as a bank, issues signed, non anonymous promises to

A nym would like to know what the total amount of such signed obligation is,
so that he can be sure it is less than the total value of the institutions good name and readily findable and confiscatable assets.
But we do not want a bunch of outsiders getting a list of lots of private
information about who owns what, (such as auditors who are usually in the
pockets of the tax collectors).   The institution needs to be able
to prove that it only owes total amount X in this form, without letting Tom, Dick, and Harry know who it owes amount X to, and why.
To do this it organizes its accounts in a binary tree, and constructs a one
way checksum tree checksum, revealing to each custom the part of the tree he
is on, all the way up to the root, which must be the same for all customers,
and must be placed in some public place, so that any customer can tell that his account is included in the total openly admitted obligations of the institution, and any customer can, by revealing secret information, prove that he is one of the people that the institution has publicly admitted owing money to.

@_subject: PILATE SAYETH UNTO HIM... 
Say Jim, did you major in sociology literature:
Here is Dave Barry on college and truth:
   After you've been in college for a year or so, you're supposed to
 choose a major, which is the subject you intend to memorize and  forget the most things about.  Here is a very important piece of  advice: Be sure to choose a major that does not involve Known Facts  and Right Answers.
  This means you must *not* major in mathematics, physics, biology,
 or chemistry, because these subjects involve actual facts.  If, for  example, you major in mathematics, you're going to wander into class  one day and the professor will say: "Define the cosine integer of  the quadrant of a rhomboid binary axis, and extrapolate your result  to five significant vertices." If you don't come up with *exactly*  the answer the professor has in mind, you fail.  The same is true of  chemistry: if you write in your exam book that carbon and hydrogen  combine to form oak, your professor will flunk you.  He wants you to  come up with the same answer he and all the other chemists have  agreed on.  Scientists are extremely snotty about this.
   So you should major in subjects like English, philosophy,
 psychology, and sociology -- subjects in which nobody really  understands what anybody else is talking about, and which involve  virtually no actual facts.  I attended classes in all these  subjects, so I'll give you a quick overview of each:
 read little snippets of just before class.  Here is a tip on how to  get good grades on your English papers: Never say anything about a  book that anybody with any common sense would say.  For example,  suppose you are studying Moby-Dick.  Anybody with any common sense  would say that Moby-Dick is a big white whale, since the characters  in the book refer to it as a big white whale roughly eleven thousand  times.  So in *your* paper, *you* say Moby-Dick is actually the  Republic of Ireland.  Your professor, who is sick to death of  reading papers and never liked Moby-Dick anyway, will think you are  enormously creative.  If you can regularly come up with lunatic  interpretations of simple stories, you should major in English.
   PHILOSOPHY: Basically, this involves sitting in a room and
 deciding there is no such thing as reality and then going to lunch.  You should major in philosophy if you plan to take a lot of drugs.
   PSYCHOLOGY: This involves talking about rats and dreams.
 Psychologists are *obsessed* with rats and dreams.  I once spent an  entire semester training a rat to punch little buttons in a certain  sequence, then training my roommate to do the same thing.  The rat  learned much faster.  My roommate is now a doctor.
   If you like rats or dreams, and above all if you dream about rats,
 you should major in psychology.
   SOCIOLOGY: For sheer lack of intelligibility, sociology is far and
 away the number one subject.  I sat through hundreds of hours of  sociology courses, and read gobs of sociology writing, and I never  once heard or read a coherent statement.  This is because  sociologists want to be considered scientists, so they spend most of  their time translating simple, obvious observations into  scientific-sounding code.  If you plan to major in sociology, you'll  have to learn to do the same thing.  For example, suppose you have  observed that children cry when they fall down.  You should write:  "Methodological observation of the sociometrical behavior tendencies  of prematurated isolates indicates that a casual relationship exists  between groundward tropism and lachrimatory, or 'crying,' behavior  forms." If you can keep this up for fifty or sixty pages, you will  get a large government grant.

One way of allowing private citizens to have privacy from their neighbors while still enabling legitimate government supervision

without the citizen units knowledge, thus allowing citizens full
curtain enabled privacy without interfering with legitmate government
security interests.
This will also help the government protect the citizen unit from exposure to dangerous and harmful thoughts and ideas.
Present efforts to inclulcate children with a correct outlook on life
are often frustrated by subversive, racist, or anti social teachings
at home.   This measure could help citizen units to ensure that their
speech is sensitive to the concerns of minorities and oppressed groups
and to current government views.
Since many shopkeepers already have such devices in their shop, there
is ample precedent for this system. A good start on such a system would be have the existing shop devices
run to the police instead of the shopkeeper.

I am leaving cypherpunks for a while, perhaps forever.
Why should anyone handle a high volume list as a list and not

to our tools for handling mailing lists.
The reason to prefer mailing lists is that the very
inconvenience keeps out the ignorant masses.  Word initially
spreads person to person, and intelligent and highly motivated
people make most of the contributions, Thus the glory days of cypherpunks, an insider club of the best
and brightest, far superior to the common herd, where we planned and
organized for a world where the ignorant masses can no longer
rob and harass their superiors, a world where the elite can
live the good life in freedom and comfort and abandon the
useless worthless masses to wander blindly into ruin, despair,
and slavery, lost in a world they cannot understand, and will
no longer have the power to smash.
In those days we forged the weapons and planned the strategies,
defending the net against the enemies of freedom.
But with the passage of time, we got the same half human
trash as you encounter in the newsgroups, and less satisfactory
tools to filter them. The glory days are long past, and cannot be revived by forming
a new mailing list.
Perhaps I will see you guys on Usenet, by and by.

Teledesic, the censored internet in the sky.
Late last year the organized violence monopolies of the world voted to give Bill Gates 400 Megahertz of bandwidth, at the same frequency in each monopoly.  I would guesstimate the value of this grant to be around ten billion dollars.  Don't run out and buy Microsoft shares.  When I said Bill Gates, I meant Bill Gates.  I did not mean Microsoft.
Bill Gates intends to build an internet in the sky, eight hundred satellites in low earth orbit, each of them with big bandwidth connections to its nearest neighbors, and each with a four hundred megahertz connection to each of many squares of ground underneath it.
What caused the collected killers of the world to show such unanimous
generosity towards Bill Gates?
Bill Gates proposed a network that would be completely censorable.
He will not sell pipes to his space backbone, he will sell pipes
from a particular rectangle on the ground to its space backbone.
You would buy a right to connect from any place in a single small
area, not any a right to connect from any place in the world, and Bill Gates would only sell such rights to government approved organizations, which would then presumably resell connections
to private individuals -- connections that would first run through
government controlled pipes to check for politically incorrect bits
before they reached Bill Gates' sky backbone.
Of course we should not condemn him too harshly for this:  He needs
approval from Singapore, Iran, France, Germany, Communist China, and the like, in order to get a single uniform world wide frequency band, and would be unlikely to get it for any reasonable proposal.
The government pipes in his proposal are as useless as wheels on
a fish, because he promises his ground stations will be quite Therefore private citizens who are not permitted direct access
to his internet in the sky will feel the impact of tyranny
immediately in their wallets.
Bill Gates internet in the sky will provide short and near
constant latency, therefore telephone connections running
through it should be pretty good, whereas existing internet
phone sucks mightily.
Teledesic is promised to come on line in 2001, though we have
seen how Microsoft meets schedules in the past.  I conjecture 2006.  I also predict that once the scheme is securely
in place, and jamming it becomes painful, Bill Gates
will find a thousand ways to chisel the government monopoly middlemen in his proposal.
I would guess that Motorola's less ambitious Iridium project
will only be a year or two late, but it has little potential
to revolutionize the world the way Bill Gates proposal has.
I expect once the scheme is in place, the government monopolies
in Gate's plan will be under attack both from above and from below.

@_subject: Why organizations turn statist. 
The EFF is ultimately a business lobby group, because it gets
most of its funding from businesses.  It is therefore potentially
subject to the same corruption as other business lobbies.
Business lobby groups are intermediaries, and therefore serve
two masters, both the politicians and the businessmen, not one
master.  Frequently they serve the interests of the politicians
at the expense of their donors, at the expense of the goals
that the lobby group is supposed to pursue.
Suppose for example you have a lobby group that
represents the widget industry.
On the one hand, the CEO of General Widgets might ring them up and say: "We are being trashed by these great japanese widgets, and unless something is done about it we might have to reduce prices or improve quality", and the lobby organization has a little chat with some tame politicians about the terrible suffering the Japanese are inflicting on American workers.   That is the way lobby groups are supposed to work, but seldom do.
On the other hand sometimes the politician (or a
gofer on his staff), rings the lobby and says:  "I need a
million dollars fast:  What potential political action gets the
chairman of General Widgets waking up in a cold sweat in the
middle of the night?  What could destroy the widget industry, and yet be politically feasible?"  Shortly thereafter the lobbyist has a little chat with chairman of General Widgets about forthcoming legislation.  The lobby group
gets a big bag of money, some of which it passes on to
the politician, and the threatened legislation evaporates until the next election.
To be a successful lobby group, the EFF needs to get its
fingerprints on legislation, so that it can make threats and
promises to businessmen in the computer industry.
Thus the EFF's best interests as an organization are contrary
to our desires and contrary to the announced aims of the organization.  Legislation, any legislation, is in their interests and legislation, any legislation is against our Our interests, and the EFF's interest are opposed with no
apparent mutual good possible.
Now it is possible that the EFF is virtuously pursuing its
supposed goals, rather than its practical interests.  We should
consider the available evidence in order to infer what it is
in fact up to.
According to Dave Barry the word "politics" derives
from the Greek "poly" meaning many, and "ticks"
meaning small disgusting bloodsucking parasites.
In order to be well funded, the EFF needs government
regulation of the net.  The kind of regulation that would be
most effective in ensuring large donations would be regulation
that compels internet businessmen to lobby the government.
for example regulations that make impossible, inconsistent, and
contradictory requirements on those who provide software,
hardware, and services, for example a demand that big
companies police the net in ways that even governments would
find extremely difficult, such as the British child porn
crackdown, or legislation which if properly crafted would have the effect of giving some businessmen a monopoly of some aspect of the net, and putting other businessmen out of business,  for example legislation that requires case by case approval of software, or legislation that compels
the businessman to invade his customers privacy, and also
prohibits him from invading that privacy unless he has a
waiver issued by the state.

Although government services to the rich and poor cost about the same, the quality is radically different.  Thus the risk
involved in killing a poor person is vastly less than the risk involved in killing a middle class person.
This is most noticeable in education, where black children
are kept in holding pens with leaky roofs, masquerading as schools, for a cost that would suffice to build classrooms with a hot tub in each classroom and a pentium on every desk, even if we burnt the classroom down with the equipment inside every year and and replaced it every year.

@_subject: the theory of split currency 
Many third world nations employed this system, one currency for internal use only, and one currency for international transactions.  The international currency was sometimes denominated in hard currency, and reasonably convertible into it.
This strategy was frequently associated with police state tactics,
lawless imprisonment, and swift execution, for vaguely defined
economic crimes.  It has become substantially less common in
the nineties.
The external currency tended to spread into the internal economy,
despite police state measures to prevent this from happening,
and the internal currency tended to become worthless and could only be
spent while holding a gun to the head of the person accepting In countries employing this system, women, and often children
of both sexes, are often cheaply available for sexual purposes
if you have foreign currency.
I speculate that this is because people find that they *must* obtain foreign currency, the internal currency being
unspendable, and any method available to them for obtaining foreign
currency is a criminal offense.
A retreat from this system, usually by allowing the international
currency to freely penetrate the internal economy, tends to be associated with a substantial reduction in the availability
of young girls, as for example in Cuba recently.
Why am I not surprised that it was Senator Patrick Leahy of
crypto bill fame?

@_subject: Please Beta test my communications cryptography product. 
--
I have produced a program that, like PGP, provides digital
signatures and communications encryption.
This is the first beta.  Please beta test this product.
The important difference between it and other products
that provide digital signatures and encryption is that it
is not certificate based.  Instead it is signature based.
This eliminates the steep initial learning and management curves of existing products.  The user does not need use and manage specialized certificates except for specialized purposes
The big complexity and user hostility in existing products is
creating and managing certificates.
Perhaps more importantly, it also eliminates the threat we
saw in England, the threat of the government giving itself
a monopoly in certificate distribution, potentially creating the Number-Of-The-Beast system, where you need a government
certificate to log on to dirty picture sites, to buy, to
sell, to put up web pages.
The key feature of the proposed product is that any digitally signed document can be stored in the database, and itself performs the functions of a certificate, just as a normal handwritten signature does.  The user usually does not need to check a document against a certificate to see if it was signed by the "real" John Doe.  Instead he normally checks one document against another to see if they were both signed by the same John Doe.   And similarly when he encrypts a document, he does not need to use a certificate to encrypt a message to the one real John Doe, he merely encrypts a message to the same John Doe who signed the letter he is replying to.
At present people have to deal with certificate management problems regardless of whether they really need certificates.
For example the most common usage of PGP is to check that two signatures that purport to be by the same person are in fact by the same person.   Unfortunately you cannot check one signature against another directly using PGP or any of the other existing products.  Instead you have to check both signatures against a public key certificate, even if the authentication information in that certificate is irrelevant to your purpose, which it usually is, which means that you have to download the certificate from somewhere, and the person signing it had to upload it somewhere.  As PGP always checks a document against the certificate, rather than against any other document the user happens to feel is relevant to the question, the person signing the document needs to get his certificate properly signed by some widely trusted third party, which is too much trouble or too complicated for many people.

Suppose that Bob's computer from time to time formulates a plan to

hash of that plan and the DH negotiated shared secret.
Malloc (the man in the middle) cannot send this hash to Ann's computer
for Ann would discover the shared secret she is using is not the same
as the shared Bob is using.
So his computer must formulate its own plan, and send its own hash, which will not agree with Bob's plan, because Bob's computer does
not reveal the plan except by actually sending the packets.
So malloc must decompress Bob's speech packets, repacketize them, and recompress them,
Often he will not be able to send off a packet, until he has received two of Bob's packets.
So this triples the delay, and increases the speech degradation.
This should quite noticeable, noticeable enough to provoke Bob

Sending a copy to the boss of everything Alice sends is OK.
If Alice wants to send something her boss should not read, perhaps she

Sending a copy of everything Alice receives to the boss or HR is not OK.
Alice should get to control it.
It would be acceptable for the company system to keep track of what
Alice has received, and flag "Alice received something, and has not
yet filed the cleartext copy with us"
It is not acceptable to just plain snoop on what Alice receives.
Alice needs finer granuality of control.  The leakage to her boss primarily
affects her, rather than the sender.
Furthermore any auto-snoop feature sets a very dangerous precedent.
It is politically a lot more difficult for the FBI to mandate that they
can recover your data, if such a mandate leads to the message flashing up, "now sending a copy to the FBI" every time you decrypt something.

animals in this regard, and has frequently been ridiculed on this account.
I have read some of his writings, for which he was ridiculed, and the
ridicule and contempt appears justified to me.
I have read a fair bit of Gould.  His work on the evolution of non humans is perfectly plausible though controversial.
His work on humans is shear crap and is not regarded by the relevant experts
in the relevant fields as legitimate science.  In his field, he is a innovator.
Outside his field, he is a crackpot, similar to the flat earthers and the
people who claim that Socrates was black, demonstrating that even trained
scientists can degenerate into nuttery when they go beyond their area of

This employee regularly purged his mail, an operation far more effective
than merely encrypting it.

Your argument is an argument for corporate access to secure file

We have all victories except for one very important one.  Money.
Now once we take that key bastion, and it is being besieged on every front, everything else will fall in due course, but it will still be a slow process, only unusually far sighted politicians will see and fear what is happening.  There is vast inertia in social institutions.
Career civil servants have more reason to take the long view than do politicians.  Politicians do not really care if the state is being

And that is where you are wrong:
We need crypto legislation like we need nine inch nails hammered through
our skulls.
Any legislative attention to crypto is bad and dangerous, as we have been
saying for years, and has just been dramatically proven once again.
Business lobby groups are intermediaries, and therefore serve
two masters, both the politicians and the businessmen, not one
master.  Frequently they serve the interests of the politicians
at the expense of their donors, at the expense of the goals
that the lobby group is supposed to pursue.
This is a bunch of crap:  It is highly likely that no bill will go
through.  Most bills die.   This bill should die.
Killing bills is always politically safer than passing them, doing nothing cannot get you into trouble.
This is untrue and dishonest.  No bill at all is the best step forward,
and doing nothing is always easiest to attain.
The CDT is ultimately a business lobby group, because it gets
most of its funding from businesses.  It is therefore potentially
subject to the same corruption as other business lobbies.
Business lobby groups are intermediaries, and therefore serve
two masters, both the politicians and the businessmen, not one
master.  Frequently they serve the interests of the politicians
at the expense of their donors, at the expense of the goals
that the lobby group is supposed to pursue.
Suppose for example you have a lobby group that
represents the widget industry.
On the one hand, the CEO of General Widgets might ring them up and say: "We are being trashed by these great japanese widgets, and unless something is done about it we might have to reduce prices or improve quality", and the lobby organization has a little chat with some tame politicians about the terrible suffering the Japanese are inflicting on American workers.   That is the way lobby groups are supposed to work, but seldom do.
On the other hand sometimes the politician (or a
gofer on his staff), rings the lobby and says:  "I need a
million dollars fast:  What potential political action gets the
chairman of General Widgets waking up in a cold sweat in the
middle of the night?  What could destroy the widget industry, and yet be politically feasible?"  Shortly thereafter the lobbyist has a little chat with chairman of General Widgets about forthcoming legislation.  The lobby group
gets a big bag of money, some of which it passes on to
the politician, and the threatened legislation evaporates until the next election.
To be a successful lobby group, the CDT needs to get its
fingerprints on legislation, so that it can make threats and
promises to businessmen in the computer industry.
Thus the CDT's best interests as an organization are contrary
to our desires and contrary to the announced aims of the organization.  Legislation, any legislation, is in their interests and legislation, any legislation is against our Our interests, and the CDT's interest are opposed with no
apparent mutual good possible.
Now it is possible that the CDT is virtuously pursuing its
supposed goals, rather than its practical interests.  We should
consider the available evidence in order to infer what it is
in fact up to.
According to Dave Barry the word "politics" derives from the Greek "poly" meaning many, and "ticks" meaning small disgusting bloodsucking parasites.
In order to be well funded, the CDT needs government
regulation of the net.  The kind of regulation that would be
most effective in ensuring large donations would be regulation
that compels internet businessmen to lobby the government.
for example regulations that make impossible, inconsistent, and
contradictory requirements on those who provide software,
hardware, and services, for example a demand that big
companies police the net in ways that even governments would
find extremely difficult, such as the British child porn
crackdown, or legislation which if properly crafted would have the effect of giving some businessmen a monopoly of some aspect of the net, and putting other businessmen out of business,  for example legislation that requires case by case approval of software, or legislation that compels
the businessman to invade his customers privacy, and also
prohibits him from invading that privacy unless he has a
waiver issued by the state.

In fact, the problem is not corporate sponsors.  Rather the problem is
that lobbying groups often tend to get captured by the government.  They want
to get their fingerprints on legislation, so that they can extort money
from their corporate sponsors, and are therefore eager to do the politicians bidding in any way whatever in order that they can get their fingerprints on
any legislation whatever.
This problem is unrelated to civil liberties issues.  Lobby groups for
the milk industry, small business, etc, are infamous for selling out the
interests of the businesses that support them.
I am not saying that the CDT is guilty of this, but the fact it persists
in trying to get legislation passed under present circumstances should not only alarm civil libertarians, it should also alarm big business.

One reason is that the network to convert Digicash into

Another is that people do not wish to hold large amounts of

converting money back and forth between interest bearing
forms and Digicash attracts  rather high charges. (Or used to
attract rather high charges when last I looked.)

anonymous, but is not required to be connected to one's

arguably better than the half-anonymous  money that has in

For example how could a man in the middle pass himself off as the author of Crypto Kong?
Exactly so.
Any document is potentially a certificate. Commonly you wish to link a document to network reputation, rather than a physical person.  For this purpose PGP key signing parties are largely irrelevant.   Verisign certificates primarily work to link your digital signature to your credit rating, and thus, unfortunately, also liink your digital signature to the number of the beast.
At present there is insufficient internet commerce for a credit rating not linked to the number of the beast to be useful, though this may change in the future.
John Doe usually wishes to avoid a MITM attack because his reputation is valuable.  He fears Malloc will use that reputation for Mallocs own purposes.
If John Doe's reputation is valuable, he has emitted many communications over a lengthy time.
If these are signed, and each signature contains John Doe's public key, Malloc cannot perform a man in the middle attack,

Crypto Kong, like PGP, provides digital signatures and
communications encryption.
The important difference between it and other products that
provide digital signatures and encryption is that it is not
certificate based.  Instead it is signature based.
This eliminates the steep initial learning and management
curves  of existing products.  The user does not need use and
manage  specialized certificates except for specialized
Perhaps more importantly, it also eliminates the threat we saw in England, the threat of the government giving itself a
monopoly in certificate distribution, potentially creating
the  Number-Of-The-Beast system, where you need a government certificate to log on to dirty picture sites, to buy, to sell, to put up web pages.
The big complexity and user hostility in existing products is creating and managing certificates.
For those who need contracts and certificates, (and with Kong
one almost never needs certificates) Kong handles them in an
easy and natural way.

     Certificates and contracts This aspect of Kong seems to have been insufficiently tested
in the beta tests.
 The key feature of the proposed product is that any
digitally  signed document can be stored in the database, and
itself  performs the functions of a certificate, just as a
normal handwritten  signature does.  The user usually does
not need to check a  document against a certificate to see if
it was signed by the "real"  John Doe.  Instead he normally
checks one document against other  documents stored in the
database that have the same signature. And similarly when he
encrypts a document, he does not need to  use a certificate
to encrypt a message to the one *real* John Doe,  he merely
encrypts a message to the *same* John Doe who signed  the
letter he is replying to.
At present people have to deal with certificate management  problems regardless of whether they really need certificates. For example the most common usage of PGP is to check that two signatures that purport to be by the same person are in fact by the same person.   Unfortunately you cannot check one  signature against another directly using PGP or any of the  other existing products.  Instead you have to check both  signatures against a public key certificate, even if the  authentication information in that certificate is irrelevant to your purpose, which it usually is, which means that you  have to download the certificate from somewhere, and the  person signing it had to upload it somewhere.  As PGP always checks a document against the certificate, rather than
against  any other document the user happens to feel is
relevant to the  question, the person signing the document
needs to get his  certificate properly signed by some widely
trusted third party,  which is too much trouble or too
complicated for many people.
The signatures and contracts in Crypto Kong are optionally  tolerant of email munging
The web pages contain a new web page "Business Vision" which discusses the widespread failure to adopt cryptography, the  widespread reluctance to pay for cryptography, and the  illiquidity of various products for transferring money on the net, and proposes a path to a solution.
Clearly, PGP has had rather poor penetration for business    uses, and by and large, people only need to encrypt or sign  stuff when there is money at stake.
I believe that this product will be more acceptable for  the typical businessman than PGP is, because it is easier to use, and existing business practices translate more  readily to   the identity model it supports than does the PGP identity    The web page also contains full source code.

Since release there have been a very large number of hits on
the Kong documents, and mere 102 downloads of the program,
and 74 downloads of the source code.
The large number of source code downloads indicates that I am
only reaching the crypto techie audience, that for the most
part is already able to use PGP, not the non tech audience
that Crypto Kong was designed for.
On my web page I have documentation as to how business users
can and should use this product.  (See the section "contracts

 (press release oriented towards businessmen follows:     --
    Announcing Crypto Kong.
    Free digital signatures and encryption.
    .
    Many businessmen use a faxed signature for a contract, or for
    authority to act, or worse still, a shared password, as
    stockbrokers often do.  This is almost worthless.
    The signature on a fax can be, and often is, a mere bitmap,
    not genuinely scanned in from a signature written in ink on a
    paper document, but merely applied digitally to an image in
    computer memory.  If that bitmap was also applied to some
    other document sent to the same company, which it usually
    was, then the fax proves nothing.
    On the other hand, often one cannot wait for FedEx to deliver
    signed documents.   The answer is digital signatures and
    encryption. With digitally-signed electronic documents, you
    can send unforgeable signed documents instantaneously across
    the globe.
    Crypto Kong is easy to use and it uses the same identity
    model that as businesses today use for ordinary handwritten
    signatures,  unlike other products which impose their own
    different way of handling identity.
    Crypto Kong takes away the hassles of certificate management,
    public key authentication, and complicated operating
    instructions.  Anyone can immediately use it to sign
    documents, to compare signatures  or to encrypt sensitive
    messages.  Kong compares the signatures on documents, rather
    than comparing a signature against certificates.
    Crypto Kong software makes it easy to send or receive
    digitally signed documents or use top grade encryption to
    keep messages private.
    Crypto Kong provides support for contracts and the
    documentation that accompanies transactions.
    The Crypto Kong application and detailed documentation
    information is available as a free download from the Kong
    home page:
    Kong is compatible only with Windows 95 and Windows NT.
    Complete source code is also available for download from the

Well I am not "reinventing the wheel".
Crypto Kong implements a different identity model.  It does
not suppose that there are "true names".
This leads to substantially easier identity management
(largely by abolishing identity management)
As a necessary consequence of this, if you happen to be
communicating with two different Bob Jones, Crypto Kong does
not attempt to discover which one is the one true Bob Jones
and which is the evil man in the middle Bob Jones.  It merely
keeps them distinct by applying different labels to them.
Secondly, PGP simply is not being adopted by the masses.  Of
course right now, two weeks after release, Crypto Kong is not
being adopted by the masses either, but with very little
identity management, it is far easier for the masses to use.
If you try and shove that identity stuff onto people they
will not do it.  Too much like hard work.  They will happily
let the government licensed authorities do it for them.  The
PGP model clearly has not flown yet, and it is not going to

Thanks, though this sounds like a silly judgment.
It looks to me as if the great majority of judges and lawyers, and hence presumably the great majority of CEOs, are blissfully unaware that one can do anything with a fax other than scan it in from paper and ink at one end, while it is printed out on paper and ink at the other end.
In actual fact a very large proportion of faxes never see paper and ink at either end, creating endless opportunities for manipulation.
This is a big problem for me, because I want to scare
businessmen into using digital signatures.      --digsig

@_subject: [LEGAL] Crypto as Contraband? 
--
You are getting out of date.  As the rule of law dissolves,
legal issues become insignificant, and will in due course
vanish altogether.
For example nobody knows what are the "legal issues" with
putting strong crypto on a web site, as I have done.
According to what the legislation says, what I have done is
completely in accord with legislation.  Indeed, it is
completely in accord with US legislation simply to post the
stuff. on any server inside the US, the foreigner doing the
download is violating the legislation, not the person who put
it up.  I have gone considerably further than is required by
legislation, though not nearly as far as some others have
But mere legislation counts for less and less these days.  If
you read the business press, you will frequently read them
complain of cases where the distinctions between executive,
legal, and judicial powers are effectively dissolved, and
penalties are in effect adminstratively applied for undefined
offences, or retrospectively and administratively defined
offences, often in ways that appear to personally enrich those
administering these quasi judicial powers.
Generally this sort of thing is only applied to people who
are unpleasant and unpopular.  Tobacco companies, junk bond
merchants whose businesses have been more profitable for
themselves than for many of their investors, and the like.
Of course this creates a large vested interest in demonizing
more and more people, so that more and more people can be
dealt with in this fashion.
Similar measures are applied not only to alleged recreational
drug distributors, but to lawyers who defend alleged
recreational drug distributors, but the business press tends
to report such cases less. Meanwhile formerly totalitarian countries, such as China and
Cuba, where there used to be no such things as laws, merely
some people having the power to harm other people, power
exercised in accordance with rules that those subject to this
power were forbidden to know, are moving towards the rule of
law.  It used to be that if someone imprisoned in Cuba were
to discover the actual reason for his imprisonment, he might
possibly suffer some draconian additional punishment for
improper possession of state secrets.
In a fully totalitarian state, the regime does not have rules
for most people, merely goals and desires.  If some desire is
not fulfilled, the masters will go around killing people more
or less at random until somebody fulfills that desire, or
until they have killed so many people that they suspect that
what they desire is not readily achievable, or sometimes
until they simply run out of people who might be able to
assist in fulfilling that desire.  For example all people
possessing certain skills and experience were wiped out by
Stalin, and in Cambodia everyone connected to the jute
industry in any way. Such rules as exist only apply to the
privileged, to those administering the terror, not to those
Crypto legislation is likely to resemble the announcement of a desire, rather than the announcement of rules and restrictions likely to fulfill that desire.  Indeed, the
proposals we have so far seen are desires, not rules. As you point out, that desire cannot be fulfilled, except by
means that further radically undermine the rule of law.

Since the operating temperature of the steam of a typical
nuclear reactor is only a little lower than the operating
temperature of the steam of a coal fired plant, the hot water
discharge is necessarily about the same for the same amount
of power generated.  For a nuclear plant to discharge much
more hot water than a coal plant, it would have to have much
lower thermal efficiency, which is not the case.

Yet strange to report, the banks have no problem with granting me many tens
of thousands of dollars of unsecured credit.
Perhaps your reputation is irrelevant.  Mine, however, is obviously relevant.
My former employer Informix had probably a million dollars of small,
readily fencible stuff such as memory chips in the computers of the many
large buildings to which I and about six hundred other employees had access
at any hour of the day or night.  They appeared to me to have a policy not
employing males straight out of college, but rather hiring people who had
some established background but apart from that took no special
precautions.  In particular they did not have a night watchman wandering
about at random.  Their watchman sat at the door or patrolled the exterior,
oriented solely on external threats.
The continued solvency of Informix, rental car agencies, and so on and so

Jim Choate claims that free markets are routinely overrun by
monopolies.  I say this is nonsense.
How can anyone present evidence when except for Microsoft you
have not named a single company that alleged became a
monopoly, and you have been vague about the markets that
these companies allegedly monopolized, and the periods during
which these markets were monpolized.
It is as if you were claiming that giant monsters frequently
terrorized US cities.  Unless you make a specific allegation,
no refutation is possible or necessary.
For example if you were to claim that King Kong demolished
the empire state building, then someone could point out that
the empire state building still stands.
A simple explanation for your inability to name any specific
giant monsters, or any particular places and times where
these giant monsters were rampaging, is that these giant
monsters do not exist, and never have existed.

This does not make the VCR business a monopoly.  It would

The same is true of the aluminium market, where you have all
aluminium smelted by a single provider.  There is nothing to
stop anyone else from going into the business, but because
the profit margins are razor thin, nobody bothers.  Although
there is only a single company, it is not a monopoly because
if they expanded their very thin proft margins by the

It appears to me that they have a problem because they cannot
resolve their disputes in public, thus it is hard to tell the
difference between an oppressive mafia organization that
mistreats its clients, and a legitimate mafia organization
that protects its clients.  However the government dispute
resolution apparatus does not possess any special wisdom that
the mafia dispute resolution apparatus lacks.
By and large, mafias seem to be less evil than governments,
and perform fewer violent, oppressive, and flagrantly unjust
acts than governments, and are less prone to expensive and
destructive wars.   This probably reflects the fact that such
actions by mafia chiefs are far more likely to get the mafia
chief killed, than similar acts by governments are likely to
get the ruler killed.
One might perhaps argue that some notable mafias in the US
are worse than the US government, though I have never heard

This is not quite as deranged as it seems.  The Masons are of
course not a conspiracy, but one of the services they provide
their members is a facility for constructing and operating
conspiracies.  As a result Masons have been big players on
all sides in most revolutions.
Conspiratorial political movements are common as weeds.  Most
of them aim at stealing nothing larger than arts grants,
fellowships, and research grants, and are often moderately
successful in this endeavor.  Some also aim at stealing
entire nations.  Most of these are not at all successful.  No
Masonic conspiracies have been successful in this, so far as
is known, and the Freemason movement would doubtless
disapprove of such excessive ambition and limitless greed.
The most famous success in stealing an entire nation was of
course Lenin's Bolshevik movement  (not a Masonic
conspiracy), where Lenin stole a bourgeois revolution by
conspiratorial means.  However since Lenin's coup bourgeois
revolutionaries have been on the alert against communist
plots, and the only other success in stealing a bourgeois
revolution from the outside was the Sandinistas in Nicaragua,
where (due to Violeta's naivete and excessive trustfulness)
they stole the revolution that Violeta Chamorro made.
The Masons, being explicitly pro bourgeoisie, would steal a
bourgeois revolution from the inside, if they ever stole a
revolution, which they do not appear to have done.  However,
being both bourgeois and pro bourgeoisie, if the masons were
to steal a bourgeois revolution, it would not be as
dramatically visible as it was when the Sandinistas stole the
Nicaraguan revolution, and I might well be unaware of it.

Had a bioweapons test occurred in the people's republic of San Francisco, it seems likely they would have erected billboards spelling out the details in letters visible from the moon.
I assume that this is one of these anonymous source things.  According to official, yet anonymous sources the US/CIA forces committed every crime of every regime around the world, including the purported crimes of Pol Pot in Cambodia, (I kid you not) and they are actually running a totalitarian state in the USA but the people are too brainwashed to notice.  They also sell cocaine.
Similarly, according to sources that are not anonymous, but which (strange to report) no one else can find, Nike is actually producing its shoes in something very like slave labor camps.
The reason the refutation of the CNN story (US uses nerve gas to kill defectors and exterminate villagers) made such news is that CNN was so careless as to actually name identifiable real people as the source of this story. (They needed faces and it is hard to put the faces of anonymous sources on TV.) Naturally those real people were mighty pissed and denied the story attributed to them.
There is a wagon load of similar stories using supposedly official, but anonymous sources, or sources that do not appear to be real people.  The print media works much better for such sources than TV.

I have often read allegations of manifest jury rigging, but
from highly unreliable sources.
If juries are routinely rigged, then we would expect a high
number of repeats, particularly in politically sensitive
cases such as taxes, drugs, or organized crime.  We would
expect a drug jury to be composed primarily of people who
have been repeatedly called for a drug jury previously.  If
juries are rigged, it should be easy to check statistically.
Simply compare the number of repeats at a jury call with the
expected number of repeats.
To rig a jury by excluding undesirables such as Tim May would
be far too laborious.  To rig a jury it would be necessary to
include only desirables, thus the pool from which the jury is
selected would be vastly smaller than the official pool, and
simple statistics would show this up.

The number of identifiable undesirables is too small to
guarantee the desired trial outcome.  To ensure a desired

We are not defeated.
We have won many key victories, and only one, though the
biggest one, remains to be accomplished.
Our failures have had obvious and remediable causes.
Few people use encryption technology today, because few
people have real need of it.
Few people have real need of it, because there is no
reasonably liquid net money. People are not making, spending,
transferring, and promising, money through the net, so they
have little need to encrypt their messages or care for the
reputation of their nyms.
And that is the big remaining battle.
Net money.  Net money that is reasonably liquid, that many
people acquire, that many people spend, money that is readily
convertible to worthwhile goods and services.  Don't worry
about blinding and all that.  Once any sort of net money is
flowing in large amounts, all that stuff then becomes
possible and desirable.  If there is no liquidity, nobody
cares about blinding, and if you have blinding it does you no
good anyway without liquidity.
Once we get that, we will shortly get it all.  As long as we
do not have that, we have very little.
Digicash failed because it was proprietary.  For net money to
be a success we need a standard for transferring promises to
pay that is separate from the software issuers, and thus
separate from the issuers of promises to pay or deliver.  It
has to be a standard such that anybody can play, anyone can
write software that will interoperate with software written
by others, and anyone can issue promises to deliver anything,
so that Ann, Bob, and Carol can transfer and exchange
promises between each other subject only to the need to trust
each other, without needing permissions or licenses from
anyone else.
And it has to have software that is competitive with existing
methods of transferring value.
Credit cards are very competitive for transactions of modest
size, because of the additional services, in particular
dispute arbitration and resolution provided by the card
issuers, and because of their large installed base. Smaller
players cannot hope to compete in that area.
We have however no adequate means for small payments, five
dollars to fractions of a cent. This offers a fertile
opportunity for the development of netmoney.
We also have no entirely satisfactory means for large low
margin payments..
The large payment problem could be addressed by some system
that provided a tight connection between internet money and
US dollars in US banks, or, better, a system that provided a
tight connection between internet money and US dollars in non
US banks, or, if we had a large and liquid micropayment
system, it could be provided by a tight connection between
micro and macropayments.
If several banks in some moderately popular banking haven
allowed people to transfer funds instantly and cheaply from
one account to another within the haven, through digitally
signed messages passing through https protocol, this would
make it possible to readily solve the large payment problem
by offering the means to create a tight connection between
net dollars and offshore dollars.  If this were done then the
revolution would ensue within a few years. So far none have
been willing to do this, perhaps out of fear of reprisals,
more likely out of sheer inertia.
The offshore dollar system is probably larger and more
liquid, and is certainly considerably more free, than the
onshore dollar system, but it is inconvenient for modest payments. People use it primarily for transfers of many
thousands of dollars.  Also the connection between the
offshore dollar and the onshore dollar is weak, because it is inconvenient, slow, and costly, to transfer dollars between
the offshore and onshore banking systems.
I see no possibility that anyone will be permitted to create
a strong connection between an internet dollar and the
onshore dollar, whereas it is quite possible that someone
will get away with creating a strong connection between the
internet dollar and the offshore dollar.
Alternatively, (and perhaps more likely) a satisfactory
solution to the micropayment problem automatically brings in its train a solution to the large payment problem, since the
software must accumulate many small promises into a few large
promises, and provide means to transfer these large promises
through numerous intermediaries, thus a large volume of
micropayments will create the liquidity for macropayments.
We do not need the banks to win this one, though they would
be very handy.
Large promises to pay could acquire value not through a fast
and cheap connection to the banking system, whether onshore
of offshore, but through a fast and cheap connection to the micropayment system, resulting in an internet dollar that
derives its liquidity from the internet market, and is
coupled to the US dollar no more strongly, and no less
strongly, than the offshore dollar is coupled to the onshore
Of course for this to work, we will need a large and liquid
market for aggregated micropayments. The existing finance
systems for self publishing, dirty pictures, and gambling,
really do not work very well, so there seems an obvious and
large market for micropayments.
Jakob Nielsen, an apparently well informed internet commerce
pundit who claims familiarity with lots of market research
and has himself done lots of market research has argued that there is a large and compelling market for micropayments  "The Case for Micropayments" Jakob Nielsen:
       Some analysts say that users don't want to be
       "nickeled and dimed" while they are online. In fact,
       the problem is being dimed; not being nickeled.
       Unfortunately, some sites that currently charge for
       content do so at a level of a dollar or more per page.
       Such pricing is obviously unpleasant and will only be
       acceptable for highly  value-added content that users
       can predict in advance that they will benefit        significantly from buying. Regular articles (like this
       column) cannot be that expensive.        Long-distance telephone calls and electricity are both        metered services. Many people do feel a tension while        they are on the phone, at least while making an        international or other expensive call. At the same        time, very few people worry about powering a        lightbulb, even though doing so costs a few cents per        hour. Electricity charges mainly serve to make people        turn off the lights when they go to bed. The        difference is clearly in the level of pricing:
       less than a cent per minute and people use as much as        they need (electricity) 10 cents per minute, and        people ration their usage a little (long distance        phone calls) 40 cents per minute, and people ration        their usage a lot (international calls)  On the Web,        users should not worry about a cent per page. If a        page is not worth a cent, then you should not download        it in the first place. Even as the Web grows in        importance in the future, most people will probably        access less than 100 non-free pages per day (in June        1998, heavy users visited an average of 46 pages per        day).  Most users will have $10-$30 in monthly service        charges for Web content. One cent, or half a cent, is probably the sweet spot for
pages and dirty picture, with quarters being the sweet spot
for games and gambling.
Obviously pay pages cannot and should not be searched by
search engines, so the typical design would be a free,
searchable, index page containing lead in paragraphs and pay
links to the non free pages on the site, or a collection of
free summary pages each containing a pay link to the
corresponding non free page, or (better) both a free index
page and also a collection of free summary pages.
We want the payment system to introduce no additional delays
when we click on a link, so the index page should cause any
necessary negotiations between the browser and server so that the server is ready to accept the coins of this particular
user, so that the user can get the pay page with a single
message, a single URL containing a coin.  The server then
immediately starts downloading the page without waiting for
any further messages to complete, and simultaneously attempts
to deposit the coin.
Suppose you are browsing dirty pictures, and both you and the
server are clients of the same token issuer.  Then the token
issuer knows that you are browsing the dirty picture pages,
and knows how much money the dirty picture issuer is making.
But for the scheme to be successful, we need many token
issuers, and the means to transfer aggregated token values
between issuers, so that in general the entity that takes
your bank money and provides you with net money, and the
entity that takes the dirty pictures servers netmoney and
provides it with bank money, will be very different entities, probably in very different jurisdictions, separated by a
chain of intermediaries, who have an economic incentive to
aggregate transactions, thus obscuring individual spending
and getting.
If any creditworthy person can issue tokens, privacy is not
such a big problem, and if the aggregated values representing
large numbers of tokens are readily transferable in a large
liquid market intermediary market, it is not a problem at
all, since the dirty picture issuer and the guy looking at
the dirty pictures are likely to be anonymous to the token The IBM token scheme provides for intermediaries.  Previous
token schemes did not.  This is an important step forward.
Until now, no one has issued a micropayment scheme that had a ghost of a chance. The IBM scheme seem basically workable,
though I need to examine it further.
Micropayments have not failed.  They have not yet been tried.
We still have not seen a scheme attempted that had all the
requirements that real netmoney will need.  It is simply quite a bit of work to design these things, and to get them
deployed in a form that ordinary mortals can use.       --digsig

IBM is proposing that anyone, or many people, will be free to
act as issuers of promises to pay in their proposed microcash
system.  Obviously their system is not very open, but unlike
previous amateurish proposals for microcash, it does support
a rich system of intermediaries transferring aggregated
promises to pay.
We really need an open system, which IBM is not, which goes
down to millicent values, which IBM does not, and which
supports intermediaries moving aggregated transactions, so
that customer and server to not have to be clients of the
same intermediary, which IBM does support, and previous
proposals for micropayment did not.

On the contrary, it is the server end that is hard.
Token generation is trivial.  Paying for tokens and getting
paid for them is not trivial.
The problem is that we do not want to force everyone in the
universe to be the clients of a single giant issuer.  That
would bring us right back to the old problem of the
tyrannical and oppressive central bank.
Visualize the following situation.  I buy tokens from Bob,
who may be my local ISP.   I spend them on a server on a site
in Sri Lanka.  The owner of the server cashes them with
Evonne.  My money, aggregated with a multitude of other
peoples money in a multitude of other peoples transactions
flows by some complex and indirect route to through several
different people, and eventually to Evonne, and finally to
the owner of the server in Sri Lanka.

does address, and it is a hard problem.     --digsig

The election outcome is great.
With a bit of luck, we should see the supremes do a party line 5/4 vote on a partisan issue, further destroying what little credibility they have left.
With a bit more luck we should see two slates of electors, one proclaimed by the courts, and one by the legislature and executive.
Bush's case against the Florida supremes was great:   His team shot them down root and branch, claiming that everything they did and said was beyond their jurisdiction, as of course it was, but if one of them had been caught scratching his bum, I am sure Bush would have argued that the offending judge lacked jurisdiction to find his own bum also.

Payee traceability made it possible to close accounts related to pornography.   Ecash is not truly cash like if the issuer can prevent it from being used by tax evaders, child pornographers, money launderers and  > I'd have thought the thing to do was put an ecash client in Mozilla

Internet explorer already has the necessary hooks.  If we put the ecash wallet into an active X control then when the user navigates to a ecash page, the user will see the usual warning "Do you trust code signed by so and so".  If he clicks yes, the code will be downloaded to the client and installed behind the scenes, and he will never see that warning again, unless he encounters a page with an updated version of the ecash control.

The html code on the thumbnail page where one clicks on a porno link will need to be rewritten to support ecash.   If the porno page server is using IIS, the server will need an ISAPI extension to handle URL's containing ecash payments.   Apache has a similar extension mechanism, but I have never written an extension for an Apache server.
The page that has for-pay links does not need anything unusual about its server, or about the client's Internet explorer, but the server that serves links containing ecoins in their urls will need an extension, similar to extensions I have written before.
 > Try to make it as painless and instant as possible to buy ecash.
Unfortunately, if ecash is truly untraceable, you cannot give people their ecash until their payment clears, which means you cannot let them pay by credit card.  They would be able to pay by e-gold, Paypal, paper cheque or wire transfer.

Ecash is not supposed to be like credit cards.
Had the coins been cashlike, joe pornographer could have sold them under the table to the flying nun, who would then cash them in her very respectable account, and pay Joe pornographer under the table.

Payee traceability made it possible for the vendor to control who used his ecash.  With truly untraceable cash, the vendor can no more control who uses his coins than can an issuer of physical coins.

When Jews are murdering small children in reprisals against stone throwing by young men, and Arabs are blowing up school buses, then anti semitic statements against both Arabs and Jews become legitimate, indeed required.
Are you an anti semite, or are you indifferent to the murder of children.  Choose one.

A state is a monopoly of legitimate force.  What makes a state a state is that the policeman can whack me, and I cannot whack the policeman.  This destroys and undermines law, it does not sustain law.
Only a few animals have such severe inequality of force, mostly less intelligent ones, (chickens, social insects), and humans have not had a pecking order this severe and extreme throughout most of our evolution.
What makes Gaza not an anarchy is that it has policemen, and these policemen answer to a single central authority.  It is not absence of laws that makes places anarchic, but absence of rulers.

We are using the world anarchy to mean a system with no ruler, and seek an anarchy with laws and without rulers.  When you describe Russia and Gaza as anarchies, you are using the term to describe absence of laws, rather than absence of rulers.

Stalin and Hitler were especially firm believers in the principle that evil is merely a question of perspective, and thus any nation that got in the way of mass murder, notably the US, was, by their theory, especially evil.  Indeed Stalin made "objectivism" a thought crime, punishable by death.  By "objectivism" he meant the belief that truth was a matter of fact, rather than authority.

 > Looks like the Wobblies live...
The wobblies never lived.
In the USA, class struggle unionism collapsed at the end of the nineteenth century.  The wobblies were a "union" composed almost entirely of the leadership of vanished class struggle unions, with very few actual workers among their membership.  All chiefs, no indians.  From the very beginning in 1905, the wobblies were a nostalgic look back to the glory days of the 1870s and 1880s of class struggle unionism, as if in 1980 some forty year old ex hippies were to form a commune in memory of the sixties.
During the early days of unionism, the 1870s, many unionists believed that the union was destined to replace the capitalist.  Some of them believed the union would replace the capitalist while retaining the market economy in whole or part (syndicalism) and some believed the union would replace the capitalist and the entire market economy (socialism, one big union)
In some parts of America they actually had some substantial success with this program.  It then instantly became apparent that replacing the authority of the man who pays you, with the authority of the man you elected, was not an improvement, because the man you elected (claiming to be "the workers") claimed the authority to punish individual workers who did not do as they were told, whereas the unelected man with money claimed no such authority.
After several horrifying incidents in which unions indiscriminantly murdered numerous members of the working class, class struggle unionism became violently unpopular among the working class in the USA.  It then steadily and rapidly lost power to bread and butter unionism, sometimes voted out,  and sometimes, when the violence of the class struggle union made voting and competition impossible, crushed by the militia.
After all the class struggle unions had irrevocably lost power or been crushed, the washed up remnants of their leadership, remembering the glory days of their youth, formed the IWW, the wobblies, from remnants of the leadership groups of 57 different class struggle unions.

If morality is merely relative, then what is wrong with murdering a few million jews, kulaks, or people as irritating as James A. Donald?  All a matter of perspective, isn't it?
 > "evil" could, I believe, be *defined* as "the term pretty much

People who use this definition have a disturbing tendency to define entire social groups, races, classes, as their enemies.
The reason we define certain killings as murder is not because "the bible tells us so",  but because we want to know if a killing indicates that the killer is apt to kill murderously.
In practice we notice that one piece of metal is like another, and other kinds of metal unlike, and we call one such group of pieces of metal "iron", "iron" being our word for that commonality that makes them alike.  The naming does not make it iron, but the character of the metal Similarly we observe that one deed, and one man, is like another, and another unlike, and we call one such group of men and deeds "evil", "evil" being our word for that commonality that makes them alike.
Let us look at how real people in real life use the word "evil":
Immediately after the bombing of Serbia, lots of US government officials went out on TV to argue that the bombing of Serbia was necessary and advisable because the ruler of Serbia was
"evil".  I do not have a transcript, but it seemed clear to me that they did not argue that he was evil, therefore deserved to have his soldiers blown up, but instead argued that he was evil, therefore his soldiers were likely to cause harm, therefore it was a wise precaution to blow his soldiers up.
They unhesitatingly drew an empirical conclusion from a normative fact, and they reasonably expected that everyone listening would find the alleged normative fact compelling evidence for the empirical conclusion.
They crossed the "is ought gap" without the slightest difficulty, and so does everyone else except for monsters and philosophers.  I find it striking that many of the philosophers who have such great difficulty with this alleged gap have some connection to monstrous regimes.  Not all of them by any means, but most of them.

I notice you imply that the Nazi liquidation of the Jews has been wildly Killing several million Jews is murderous because killing Jews merely for being Jewish is like killing me, therefore someone who liquidates the Jews is likely to kill me, someone who favors rendering society Jew free is likely to kill me if he had the power.
Similarly anyone who thinks that Stalin was too soft on the kulaks (read the various commie criticisms of Stalin) would certainly kill me if he had the power, for the same reasons as he would kill the kulaks.

You cannot prove that iron is iron with the structure of a mathematical proof, because it is a fact about the world, and empirical fact, ultimately resting on the evidence of the senses.  To deduce the necessary "because", one must start from the nature of man, and the nature of the world.

Then they were wrong, just as they would have been wrong had they called iron copper.
And evidence that they were wrong is that a great many of them died of that error, for nazis killed more nazis than they did commies, just as the commies killed more commies than they did nazis, something that anyone could have foreseen had he recognized that killing Jews was murder, that killing capitalists for being capitalists was murder.
The Nazi claim was that the killing of Jews was not indicative of a propensity to murder Aryans.  The commie claim was that killing of capitalists was not indicative of a propensity to murder proletarians.
These claims, of course, were false, because killing Jews capriciously, or because they were Jews, or killing capitalists
capriciously or because they were capitalists, is in fact morally similar to killing anyone whimsically and capriciously, is in fact murder.
Not "deemed to be murder".
Not "socially constructed as murder".
It really is murder, really is capricious and unreasonable killing, and hence it really is indicative of propensity to kill people capriciously, which is why we feel about murder as we do, feel that it is wrong.
If the nature of man and the world was what you imagine it to be, if it was true that killing Jews was not indicative of propensity to kill Aryans, then Trotsky's "their morals and ours" would be right and I would be wrong;  Hobbes in "Leviathan" would be right and I would be wrong.
The evidence however is that I am right and you are wrong, that I am right and Trotsky is wrong, that I am right and Hobbes is wrong, that I am right and Hitler was wrong
The evidence is that killing Jews is like killing me, that killing witches is like killing me, that killing capitalists is like killing
me.  Not "socially constructed as like killing me".  Really like killing me.

I observe the contrary -- that people who go into anti Nazi newsgroups and purport to argue a careful position that the Jews were not murdered, or at least no very many of them, and anyway they had it coming, are generally not called nazis by most people, even though they quite obviously are nazis.  Same goes, even more strongly, for commies, even those who loudly announce that they reject Lenin and Stalin, and then proceed to argue that Lenin and Stalin were softies, that they failed to suppress capitalism with sufficient vigor.

The people of Serbia were wrong to vote fascists into power, though US intervention saved them from themselves, so they did not discover for themselves the consequences.

The word murder does appear.  Murder is defined as "wrongful killing.", hence is by definition a particular kind of evil.  Indeed it is the archetypal example of evil, the type specimen of evil.
The point is that to know whether a killing indicates the killer is likely to kill me, I have to make a moral judgement of the killing, to determine that the killing is morally similar to killing me.
Trotsky thought that killing political enemies of the bolsheviks was different from killing Trotsky.  He was wrong.
Conversely people who believe that the Vietnam war was an evil act of aggression are likely to erroneously believe that Vietnam veterans are dangerous people, whereas people who have a more balanced view of the Vietnam war have a more accurate perception of Vietnam veterans.

Surely the events of the twentieth century settled the matter decisively.  Those who believe otherwise are monsters or fools, knaves or dupes.  When people die as a result of their error, others should learn.

If this was so, why do regimes that propagate evil ideas find it so vital to control all sources of information?  Their hostility to empirical evidence, their hostility to the mere act of paying attention to empirical evidence, shows that it is not so easy to maintain false moral beliefs in the face of the evidence, shows that most people can not only easily cross the is-ought gap, but scarcely refrain from doing so.
Anyone who propagates false moral beliefs also propagates false emprical claims supporting those false moral beliefs -- hence for example the continual debates where Marxists claim that Marx's predictions are coming true.  If there was an is ought gap, they would find it unnecessary to so tightly couple moral and factual claims.

Evil, wrong, and murderous are not different categories.  "Murderous" is the classic example of evil, and when I talk of "wrong" I say that the Trotsky's moral judgements were in error.

Those who are aware of the existence of objective evil predicted that the nazis and the commies would murder friend and enemy alike.  Those blind to this obvious fact failed to make that prediction.

Those who claim to that killing people in warfare is no different from killing people in peace, are more likely to exterminate subjects during peacetime, than they are likely to refrain from killing enemies in wartime.

Remembering that both german and non german deaths were caused by germans, we should use body count as a measure of evil.

Friendly fire is an accident, an error.  The murder of commies by commies and nazis by nazis was planned from the very beginning.

My newsreader, like most people's newsreaders, automatically downloads those newsgroups I am interested in full, in the background.   Therefore there is no way anyone can no which particular message of "alt.anonymous.messages" I have read.
Alt.anonymous.messages is completely effective.  It does not provide mere obscurity, but rather supplies true security.  To determine who I am communicating with, and what I was saying, the adversary would need to compromise my firewalled computer.

I use Agent.
If you do not use such a newsreader, you should probably use the "secret-admirers" list, to ensure that no one can tell which particular message you care about.
If, however, you use a newsreader like Agent to download all of alt.anonymous.messages, as I do, you get the same security, and greater      --digsig

If running a business is a privilege, then of course it will be restricted to the privileged, which is exactly what we see in the more extreme social democracies, where the people running the show are usually the lineal descendents of those who got their start at the time of Napoleon.

That is the default, but the settings can be changed for one newsgroup, or all of them.  You should do this for the newsgroups you are particularly interested in, for the sake of convenience, and for those newsgroups were logging could cause you embarrassment.

In politically sensitive cases, government likes to choose the council, and frequently chooses council that makes the defendant extremely unhappy.  Probably Jim Bell is broke, but he has not been soliciting assistance for his council

The main thing they will discover is that a lot of people are reading and posting.  This makes the information that one particular person is posting and reading not very useful.

Baloney.  That is the "everyone else is doing it" excuse.  Not everyone else is doing it.  Those that were doing it, were monsters, and decent people had no hesitation in saying so, centuries ago as much as today.   See, for example Saint Thomas Aquinas on the persecution of jews.

Sure.  When  the US fled, the killing escalated and spread, rather than diminished, showing that the cause of the war was communist aggression, something that had not been altogether clear before the US was defeated.

Evil people are likely to do hurtful things (bad things) to me unless I get them first.  Normal people will not do hurtful things to me unless I do bad things to them first.  Hence my use of nazis, commies, and murder as illustrations and examples of evil.  As I would point to the a particular piece of iron to define all iron, to define the category iron, in the same way I point to murder, nazis, and commies to define all evil, to define the category evil.

The nearest equivalent in European history to the crimes of the the nazis and commies was the spanish inquisition,and that was a small scale operation: Handcrafted murder rather than mass produced murder.  Each victim was individually identified and processed, rather dumped by the truckload.  They murdered about 12000, and the world was horrified by their Tom Vogt:

No they do not.
Laws of war are universally accepted by except by those who break them.  Those who claim to find it terribly shocking that innocents get killed when legitimate military targets are attacked, never seemed to notice when their favorite terror regimes murdered hundreds of thousands of peasants in peacetime.
 > what about the israel/rest-of-the-near-east problem? both sides call

This is the classic problem of pointing out the mote in the other's eye while ignoring the beam in one's own eye.  Both sides use the murder of children as a deliberate tactic to get their way.  The middle eastern Jews are likely to murder any non Jew, as their christian allies in Lebanon so painfully discovered, and perhaps the crew of the USS Liberty discovered also, and the arabs are similarly likely to murder friends and allies.  On both sides, murdering scum are in charge with overwhelming popular support.  When Clinton was organizing peace talks, he had one arm around a murdering terrorist, and his other arm around another murdering terrorist.  This was the basic cause of the lack of success in the peace talks.

Both.  As is confirmed by the propensity of both to deliberately murder innocents and allies.

No it does not work the other way around.
Normal people killing nazis and commies is not equivalent to nazis and commies killing normal people, for normal people are a threat only to evil people, whereas nazis and commies are a threat to everyone, including their fellow nazis and commies
The jews really were not making war on western europe, germany, and the aryan race.  The nazis really were making war on western europe and the jews.

War crimes, bad they though are, are not the same as similar crimes committed against an unresisting and disarmed populace.
Many governments have committed crimes similar to those committed by the nazis and commies in the course of fighting guerrilla wars, for example the recent war crimes in Guatemala  But when the guerrilla war ended, those governments ceased to commit those crimes.  With commies and nazis, the end of resistance frequently resulted in an escalation, rather than diminution of those crimes, as for example recently occurred after the communist victories in Cambodia and South Vietnam.
During the American war between the states, the feds created artificial famine in much the same way, for much the same reasons, as the Soviet, Cambodian, North Korean, and Ethiopian governments did, deliberately starving non combatants just as communist regimes did.  When the war between the American states ended, so did hunger, whereas in communist states, the famine intensified as resistance diminished.  The less the resistance, the greater the destruction.
The difference between the US regime and the Pol Pot regime was small during war, but obvious after victory.

Whether they were a threat or not is an objective fact.  Jews were not a threat (unless perhaps one happens to live in Eretz Israel).  Nazis were a threat.  Anyone who says otherwise does not merely have different moral preferences.  He is deluded or lying.
In particular jews were not a threat to germans and the aryan race, whereas nazis really were a threat to everyone.
That the nazis tended to murder anyone including their fellow nazis, and commies tended to murder anyone including their fellow commies, is an objective fact, capable of being true or false.
That normal people do not tend to murder anyone, but only those that really do threaten them, is also an objective fact capable of being true or false.  From such objective facts, we can determine that the nazis really were objectively evil.
It is certainly true that many jews intended and continue to intend to steal the promised land from those currently occupying it, but the nazis intended to steal the whole world, and enslave everyone in it, whereas zionist jews merely intend that the current inhabitants of places near Israel shall go a few hundred miles further away.  Those oppressed by the nazis were kept against their will and prevented from fleeing.  Those oppressed by Israel refuse to leave, despite the fact that most jewish Israelis would very much like them to go away.

I am merely using murder as the most extreme and unambiguous form of harm.  The word "evil" has two senses.  Harm suffered (morally neutral sense of the word "evil") and harm unjustifiably and willfully done, or the danger of such harm.  (Moral sense of the word "evil")
Situations often arise where it is not obvious what is "unjustifiable" and "willful", where such judgments are necessarily subjective, but in most of the cases that we care about, most of the time, it is perfectly objective.  Someone is going about his own business, and out of the blue, someone robs him, assaults him, or someone denounces him as a class enemy, race enemy, class traitor, race traitor, etc.

There cannot be evil without harm, or at least the threat and potential for harm.  "Evil" in the morally neutral sense means suffering and/or harm.  To do evil in the moral sense is one must cause suffering or harm, and to be evil one must cause the threat or potential for suffering and or harm.
Of course not every harm that one causes is evil though most are (the classic counter example being self defence) but every evil requires a corresponding harm.  They do not mean quite the same thing, but harm usually implies evil, and evil always implies harm.  If no harm, then no foul.

He describes the california system as "deregulated", but the fact that it takes many years to get permission to build a power plant -- that it takes longer to get permits than to actually build one, is undoubtedly a contributing factor to the crisis.

What has happened is that we in California have moved from a state imposed and controlled monopoly, to a highly regulated market.  This has not worked well, one of the many reasons being that those who now have to decide to build power plants are now the evil greedy developers, rather than the wise and benevolent bureaucrats, and in consequence those who want to build power plants are having great difficulty.  Naturally, however, all the newspapers are entirely confident that the problem is capitalist greed.  If it was not for those greedy people itching to destroy the environment by building power plants, we would have plenty of power.
This is analogous to the US health care crisis.  If an evil greedy capitalist health care institution decides not to give an elderly pauper triple bypass surgery, in order to retain ever greater bloated profits, that is an intolerable evil of capitalism.  If, however, a rational bureaucrat decides to wisely ration bypass surgery by ensuring that it only goes to those who can truly benefit from it, that is a wonderful saving on health costs.   As a result, governmental health care systems really are much better at controlling costs that regulated semi private health care      --digsig

 > If it's so hard to build power plants in California, what is the obsession with building them in California?
Ask the regulators in other states.  Most of the neighboring states have regulated monopolies, rather than a regulated market, which are effectively an arm of the government, in that the decision to build a plant is primarily made by the government.  A Californian power company simply has no legal right to build a power plant in Oregon, because that would violate the monopoly authorized by the state of Oregon.
 > Looking at the queue of plant requests within California they also seem to be obsessed with building them in highly populated areas.
The endangered species act makes it impractical to build power plants in less developed areas.  The process of getting approval would take over a generation.  They would first have to get someplace out in the coutryside rezoned for industry, which would probably require an initiative, which cannot be passed until the next election..  Much faster to start off with a proposal to build a plant in an area already zoned for industry.
The underlying cause of the power crisis is that the burdensome regulatory process means that power needs must be foreseen over a decade in advance, and California had an unexpected surge of growth.  Because of this growth surge we would have had a crisis anyway, but the "deregulation" made the crisis worse than it would otherwise have been, and one of the ways it made the crisis worse than it would otherwise have been is that the lead time required to get regulatory approval to build a power plant appears to have increased rather than decreased.
In fact of course, what we are seeing in California is not deregulation, but desocialization.  Regulation has actually increased substantially.  The former regulated monopoly, when it was acting as an arm of the state, had a fairly free hand to do whatever the state decided.   The many genuinely private firms do not have a free hand to do what they decide.

Of course if the evil capitalist had decided to build the plant further away, the eco freaks would be frothing with outrage about the plant destroying nature and the power lines destroying the migratory routes of animals.   It takes many more years, perhaps generations, to get past the endangered species act, no matter how frivolous and absurd the objections, than it takes to build in areas already approved for industry.

This claim is partly true, and partly false.  In a few cases the Jews have openly responded to rocks with gunfire.  I would do the same in their shoes.
In many cases someone in hiding slingshots a rock at a Jewish gunman and then runs, the Jewish gunmen men then kill some random Palestinians in reprisal, and then proclaim they think that someone was shooting at them.  Note I said Jewish gunmen, not Israeli gunmen, since non Jewish citizens of Israel are screwed almost as badly as the non citizens, because Jewish non citizens have no difficulty exercising freedom to move themselves, goods, and money throughout Israel and the occupied territories, whereas non Jewish citizens have great difficulty in doing this.
About half the Palestinians that are killed are shot in the head.  If they shot in the course of combat, more of them would be shot in the trunk.

Ideally, we should organize an election so that the illiterate, the stupid, and the drunk will generally fail to vote correctly.  Unfortunately someone would then issue the handy dandy automatic party vote generator, and hand it out to the illiterate, the stupid, and the drunk, adding a bottle of cheap wine when handing it out to the drunk.

All plea agreements are coercive.  The serious charge that the prosecutor threatens the accused with necessarily has some relationship to evidence that the prosecutor possesses, or else it would not be a threat.
The alternative lesser charge that the prosecutor offers need have no relationship to the evidence, and usually has no relationship.   It is a mere formality.
Even in non political cases, there is a strong tendency to make the lesser charge something that is wrong it itself, rather than a lesser form of the more serious charge, to make the lesser charge a crime something where police and prosecution have more support than they have for the more serious charge.

A recent news article announced the new Somalian government was recruiting to form an army.  It failed to report that the main function of this army would be to make war on other Somalis, and that the general leading this army was assassinated a couple of days after recruitment began:
I predicted that the new government would become yet another warlord.  This process seems well under way.

Because the vote is so close, the outcome depends entirely on a multitude of judgment calls about which votes count, and which are counted, and how they shall be counted.
The normal procedure in England and the democracies descended from England, or imposed by English troops, is that the major parties reach agreement before and during the vote count, on how the votes shall be counted.  In the US however, you have a multitude of laws, laws which contradicted each other, and contradicted actual practice.  For example a lot of perfectly good absentee ballots that were presented by the military in accord with the usual military practice were rejected this time because they did not comply with the letter of the law, even though they complied with custom and practice.
The cause of the uncertainty is judicial imperialism.
It is often said that Americans are litigious,but the cause of this destructive litigation is judicial willingness to unpredictably overturn existing practice.

The obvious starting market for good ecash is perverse pornography.  Another good starting market is interactive sexual performance over the internet.
There have been many attempts at ecash, but I am not aware of any products involving useful, spendable, convenient, anonymous ecash targeted at that or similar markets.  The only really usable anonymous ecash was that of the Mark Twain bank, which crippled its cash to prevent it from being used by that market.

I am simply reporting what any fool can see.  Where do we see mass starvation?  today we see it in North Korea, where the government has charge of food production and distribution, and a little earlier we saw it in Ethiopia where the same system applied.  All the big famines were created by governments.
Similarly, where do we see homelessness?  Most of it is in San Francisco, half jokingly known as the people's republic as San Francisco, because of its drastic governmental management of housing.

That is nonsense.  Famines in Africa are caused by communism and socialism, notably the famous Ethiopian famines that occurred under Mengistu, or by war, notably the famous Biafran famine.
Famines are never caused by people acting in their own interests.  They are most commonly caused by pious benevolent socialists imposing the greater good with whip and red hot irons, burning, torturing and killing because they love people so very much.  Famines are most commonly caused by socialists whose care for the suffering of anonymous strangers is so deep and heartfelt, whose love and concern for the faceless oppressed masses is so vast, that they will hold a child's face in the flames to force her mother to reveal where the seed corn is hidden.  After all, we cannot let those damned peasants look out for their own selfish interests, can we?  We love them too much to permit them such wickedness, and the flesh burning off from the bone on the face of a child is proof of how vital our mission is to save the peasants from themselves, proof of how much the peasant's wicked greedy selfishness puts them in need of our vast benevolent virtue, kindness, and generosity.

Chomsky is hardly a reliable source.  He routinely fabricates or falsifies quotes.  I suggest you check his alleged sources.
Chances are you will be unable to find his alleged source.  In the unlikely event that you are able to find it, it will not say quite what Chomsky claims it said.

Many of you may have seen news items about another attempt to form a government in Somalia.
Many of you may have seen a news item that the president entered Mogadishu, the former capital of former Somalia, surrounded by a large military force, and was warmly welcomed.
Well it seems that most of that force was not fighters loyal to the president, but fighters loyal to various factions and conflicting and incompatible special interests to which the president had made all sorts of promises.  It is not clear to what extent the forces were there to protect him and ensure he was obeyed, and to what extent they were there to make sure he delivered on his diverse promises to diverse interest groups.
The president entered Mogadishu without a shot fired.  He also left it without a shot fired, though a few prominent Somalis have announced a policy of killing him on sight.
As far as anyone can tell the president spent one day in Somalia, and is now back to leading a government-in-exile.
This does not mean that the attempt to form a government has failed, but it has not yet succeeded.

Sampos original claim was that famine was caused by private enterprise and free markets.  My original counter claim (which you dishonestly altered in each post) was that all famines were caused by socialism or war.
You on two separate occaisions have edited my original claim to make it easier to rebut.  Each time I edited it back, and each time you deleted what I wrote to change the meaning.
The first time was just careless editing.
The second time was a lie.

You are putting ordinary dictatorships, like Pinochet's Chile or Park's Korea, in the same category as communist dictatorships, like Castro's Cuba or Mengistu's Ethiopia.  That is ridiculouys.
The difference between normal dictatorships and totalitarian regimes is enormous, vastly greater than the difference between dictatorships and ordinary democracies, and the distribution of famine (excluding famines caused by war) illustrates that difference.
So let us go back to the original question:  Where was there a significant twentieth century famine other than those caused by war or socialism?
It is absurd to use categories that put normal dictatorships in the same category as totalitarian dictatorships.

How can I prove Churchill did not say this?  The problem is the curious absence of evidence that he did say it.
The words sound more Chomskian than Churchillian.  As with so many remarkably Chomsy sounding quotes the source is so vague that failure to find it can never be held as proof that Chomsky made it up.
If Churchill really said such a thing, we would have some source better than Chomsky for it, and if Churchill really did say it, Chomsky would have given us a source that was possible to verify.

Are there any examples of this documented anywhere, preferably on the web?
No one has been able to disprove any quotes or citations by Chomsky, (at least none that cannot be explained away as Chomsky giving improbable paraphrases or interpretations of other peoples words)  but his works are tightly packed with remarkable and improbable vaguely sourced quotes and citations that somehow no one has ever been able to actually verify:  For : : 	To continue, high US officials cited by the
: : 	highly-respected Asia correspondent of the (eminently
: : 	respectable) Far Eastern Economic Review predicted that 1
: : 	million would die as a consequence of the US bombings. US
: : 	aid officials leaving Phnom Penh when the KR took over
: : 	predicted that two years of "slave labor" would be
: : 	necessary to overcome the effects of the bombing.
: :	provided analyses by highly qualified specialists who have
: :	studied the full range of evidence available, and who
: :	concluded that executions have numbered at most in the
: :	thousands; that these were localized in areas of limited
: :	Khmer Rouge influence and unusual peasant discontent, where
: :	brutal revenge killings were aggravated by the threat of
: :	starvation resulting from the American destruction and
: :	killing. These reports also emphasize both the
: :	extraordinary brutality on both sides during the civil war
: :	(provoked by the American attack) and repeated discoveries
: :	that massacre reports were false
Presumably the "at most in the thousands" is a highly imaginative interpretation of Nayan Chanda, who said nothing of the kind.  As to where "repeated discoveries that the massacre reports were false" comes from, no one has ever been able to suggest a source, although Chomsky clearly leads the reader to believe that the source is the Far Eastern Economic Review.  Obviously however it is not the Far Eastern Economic Review, which failed to report any such discoveries, so presumably it is Chomsky's fertile imagination.

These are two infamous, passages, from two very different but equally infamous documents.  I tend to foolishly assume that everyone is as familiar with these endlessly repeated Chomsky debates as I am and will recognize these infamous quotes on sight.  One document is Chomsky conforming to the post 1979 Soviet orthodoxy on Cambodia, one is Chomsky, with equal veracity, conforming to the pre 1979 Soviet orthodoxy on Cambodia.
The latter quote comes from Chomsky's infamous Nation article, quoted in full at It serves my purpose of demonizing anarcho socialists better than the former quote, since the pre 1979 orthodoxy is now so wonderfully politically incorrect.

Pinochet was not a fascist, not a totalitarian, and murdered only two or three thousand.  Any communist ruler that murdered so few would be hailed as a living saint and the moral equivalent of Ghandi.  Franco was a fascist, a totalitarian, but milder than most fascists, and most fascists are milder than most communists.  Franco only murdered fifty to a hundred thousand, which would not quite qualify him for sainthood if he was a communist, but close enough.

Only if you define socialism as war.  Socialist famines are usually imposed once the proletariat have been completely disarmed, and all resistance has been shattered.  The Ukrainian famine, the hungry ghosts famine, and the recent North Korean famine are all good examples of such famines.
Socialist famines are incomparably more severe and prolonged than war famines, the two greatest famines of the twentieth century being the liquidation of the kulaks, and the hungry ghosts.
Socialist famines are in a sense caused by war, in the sense that socialism tends to be unending war against a disarmed and already conquered populace.
So let us go back to the original question:  Where was there a significant twentieth century famine other than those caused by war or socialism?

Chomsky gives what sounds like full reference information for citations, but often these citations turn out to be unverifiable or highly misleading.
My favorite example is of course "repeated discoveries that the massacre reports were false".  (No one has been able to find these discoveries)
Charles Kalina's favorite example is Chomsky's fabricated quotes supposedly from Shawcross attributing ridiculous views to Shawcross.
However I am not much interested in those.  Charles Kalina seeks to argue that Chomsky is a cult leader, not a legitimate scientist, so the example of a lie that has the effect of libelling those of Chomsky's fellow leftists who failed to follow Chomsky's leadership serves Kalina's purpose My purpose is different from Kalina's.  I seek to show that "anarcho socialists" are for the most part merely Marxists who have escalated the rhetoric about the state withering away, so the example of a lie that has the effect of serving the then Moscow line serves my purpose well.   Chomsky's pre1979 lies on Cambodia serve my purpose particularly well because the Moscow line on the Khmer Rouge changed abruptly in January Since nearly all today's anarcho socialists are incapable of issuing a statement that differs from the Moscow line as it was in 1987, they are severely handicapped in defending Chomsky.  They cannot say that what he said then about the Khmer Rouge was true, since after 1979 it became officially untrue.

It would take you years to check five hundred Chomsky citations.  His citations are at best obscure and hard to find, at worst impossible to find.
Almost every Chomsky citation that I have checked was at best somewhat misleading, and at worst a lie.
Chomsky's citations are usually false in one of three ways, sometimes false in all three ways at the same time.
1.  Chomsky misrepresents the authority of the sources.  For example in  "Distortions at fourth hand" quoted in full in  he represented Hildebrand and Porter as an independent review of evidence from impartial sources, whereas in fact they were merely mouthpieces of the Khmer Rouge.  He represented Ponchaud as merely the mouthpiece of US imperialism, while in fact Ponchaud had interviewed hundreds of refugees, and collected hundreds of first hand accounts of Khmer Rouge terror.
2.  Chomsky misrepresents the content of the sources:  For example Chomsky represented the testimony of murder, torture,and terror collected by Ponchaud as second hand, when in fact it was first hand.
3. Chomsky claims sources that just cannot be found.  In particular the article "Distortions at fourth hand" first leads up to the purported citation of "repeated discoveries that the massacre reports were false", and then proceeds to draw all sorts of conclusions from the alleged falsity of these massacre reports.  Without this alleged citation, his article, appearing a few months after the photos of the massacres north of Aranyaprathet had horrified the world, would have sounded like the banal totalitarian propaganda that is, would have sounded no different from the vast pile of totalitarian propaganda that had become so painfully familiar throughout the twentieth century.  This alleged citation is the very key and center of the whole article, and no one can find it.

Big deal.  Chomsky tells the reader that somewhere there is some underreported evidence that the reports of Khmer Rouge massacres were fake, implying that the photographs of murdered women and children that his readers had seen in the newspapers a few months previously were fraudulent.
So where is this evidence that he so confidently cites?
We are not talking about left out commas, or even omitted ellipses.  We are talking about whole damned citations that just are not there.  Chomsky complains bitterly because Shawcross' editors left out three ellipses when quoting Chomsky, and then fabricates stuff wholesale and attributes it to  > News flash for ya goodbuddy - that quote of yours has already been In his 1977 Nation article Chomsky claimed:
: : 	such journals as the Far Eastern Economic Review , the

: : 	emphasize both the extraordinary brutality on both sides
: : 	during the civil war (provoked by the American attack) and
: : 	repeated discoveries that massacre reports were false.
Pretty much every word in his claim is of course false in one way or another, a mixture of misleading half truths and outrageous blatant lies.  I can go through it word by word if anyone cares.
But let us take a different approach.  Is there any phrase in that stream of lies and misdirections that you wish to defend?  Is there anything in his claim that you are willing to defend as true?

Yet I seem to hit false citations, citations that are misleading and sometimes nonexistent, every few pages of Chomsky.  If Justin Schwartz has a success rate is so strangely different from my own, perhaps he can find the infamous citation  "repeated discoveries that massacre reports were false".  Which massacre reports were these?
And while he is at it, can he explain how come the eyewitness reports of terror and intimidation taken by Ponchaud constitute third hand reports in Chomsky's cites of Ponchaud?
And while he is at it, how come one of Chomsky's highly qualified experts who supposedly ridiculed the false reports of Khmer Rouge crimes later said that Phnom Penh was evacuated to smash resistance (a claim later confirmed by Pol Pot) and that perhaps ten percent of the population of Phnom Penh died as a result of the evactuation, an estimate he made before the famous left wing U turn on Cambodia, an estimate that contradicts the general tone of the letter Chomsky quoted, but does not contradict the substance of it or the facts reported.

Distortions at Fourth Hand
Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman
The Nation, June 25, 1977
: : 	such journals as the Far Eastern Economic Review , the
: : 	London Economist , the Melbourne Journal of Politics , and
: : 	others elsewhere, have provided analyses by highly
: : 	qualified specialists who have studied the full range of
: : 	evidence available, and who concluded that executions have
: : 	numbered at most in the thousands; that these were
: : 	localized in areas of limited Khmer Rouge influence and
: : 	unusual peasant discontent, where brutal revenge killings
: : 	were aggravated by the threat of starvation resulting from
: : 	the American destruction and killing. These reports also
: : 	emphasize both the extraordinary brutality on both sides
: : 	during the civil war (provoked by the American attack) and
: : 	repeated discoveries that massacre reports were false
So tell us, where were these discoveries that the massacre reports were false?  Who discovered them to be false, and how?
Nothing that Chomsky and Herman claim in the above is true, but the most important claim, and the most straightforward lie, is "repeated discoveries that the massacre reports were false."

You remind me of Chomsky making a big deal because Shawcross' printers dropped some ellipses, as if finding a typo in Shawcross was an answer to the evidence that Shawcross presented.

So are you now admitting that Chomsky used to continually make fraudulent citations, but claiming he has since reformed?
My reason for using Chomsky's twenty year old lies, lies from the time that the Soviet Union was at its greatest power, appeared to be winning, and appeared to be on the path to world domination, rather than his current lies, is that my purpose is to show that the most famous "anarcho" socialist intended not anarchy, but world domination by the Soviet Union, intended not some new and wonderful form of socialism, but socialism as we came to know it during twentieth century.

Some time ago, the president of Somalia returned from his exile to Mogadishu, the former capital of Somalia, which was going to be the new capital of Somalia.  Lots of people gave lots of speeches about how popular and successful the new government was, and CNN gave a glowing account of how pleased the Somalis were to have a government again.   Approximately twenty four hours later, the new government did a moonlight flit out of Somalia back into exile.
Recently the new government announced it was returning from its exile to Baidoa, which is to be the new government of Somalia.  Lots of notables gave lots of speeches about how popular and successful the new government was, and CNN gave a glowing account of how pleased the Somalis were to have a government again.
Unfortunately neither the president or any senior members of the new government were able to make it Baidoa in time for the press conference.

Merely a denial, not a rebuttal:
This essay does not actually claim that the people cited by Chomsky said the things that Chomsky attributes to them.  In particular it presents no actual examples of massacre reports that were discovered to be false.
It answers none of the criticisms that I or other people have made of Chomsky.  Instead it takes fragments of those criticisms out of context, without the specifics of that criticism, and simply denies the charges, without acknowledging or rebutting any of the evidence that Chomsky's accusers present.  It does not rebut a single charge, or address a single piece of evidence.
It does not rebut, or even address, the charges I made, or indeed any of the charges that any critic made.
Most flagrantly, it ignores the fact that Chomsky's position, and the radical left position, on Cambodia changed abruptly and radically when Soviet foriegn policy changed in January 1979, quoting statements that Chomsky made after 1979 as evidence that he did not mean the things he said before 1979.

I have often remarked on how Chomsky's board treats inconvenient facts and unwanted views in the same way that the totalitarian states that Chomsky so admired treated people who noticed inconvenient facts and people who held unwanted views.

You did not miss much.
In the most recent Chomsky thread, all the same things were said, as have been said so many times before.  Indeed, I have traced the canonical Chomsky thread back to 1967.
The canonical thread goes as follows:
Chomsky critic:  "Chomsky distorts and misrepresents the sources he cites, and attributes arguments, evidence, and statements to people that they did not make.
given any examples of Chomsky doing such a thing."

I have presented examples of Chomsky citing vaguely specified sources that supposedly provide evidence for all sorts of astonishing things, supposedly provide evidence for the then Soviet line, yet strange to report, no one is able to produce this alleged evidence. When the Soviet line changed, no one continued to claim these things were true.  In particular, no one continued to claim the existence of "repeated discoveries that massacre reports were I have looked for this alleged evidence, and not found it.  It does not appear to exist.  It is the job of Chomsky's fans, not my job, to find these "repeated discoveries that massacre reports were false", and the rest.
That was an example of evidence that Chomsky claimed existed, but which does not exist.

Of course a film citation is almost impossible to check.

In fact I have never seen the movie and do not intend to see it, but fans of Chomsky endlessly cite those above words as evidence that Chomsky is not a supporter of the Khmer Rouge.  Just do a search for "worst atrocity of the modern era" in Deja News.  And indeed, what they claim is true:  Once Soviet policy changed, Chomsky was no longer a supporter of the Khmer Rouge.

I am guilty of oversimplification here:
Chomsky and Herman 's claim to be quoting highly qualified specialists is true in the sense that one journalist who specialized in covering asia did offer opinions (opinions, not the promised evidence) somewhat similar to those that Chomsky described, but false in that the opinions of the cited "highly qualifed specialists" were considerably more cautious and less extreme than those attributed to them by Chomsky and Herman.
When Chomsky talks of "analyses by highly qualified experts" he is referring to the same people that Shawcross depicts as inexperienced stringers:
Shawcross  tells us:
: : 	Through 1974, however, as more and more reports of Khmer
: : 	Rouge brutality began to seep out of the growing areas
: : 	that they controlled, some journalists began to wonder
: : 	whether postwar reconciliation would be as easy as they
: : 	had hoped. In March 1974, the Baltimore Sun correspondent
: : 	wrote of "the incomprehensible brutality of the Khmer
: : 	Rouge communists"; the Washington Post reported on how the
: : 	Khmer Rouge were "restructuring people." Sydney Schanberg
: : 	of The New York Times wrote about the joy with which
: : 	refugees escaped Khmer Rouge control at Kompong Thom.
: : 	James Fenton wrote in the New Statesman of the fear with
: : 	which some Khmers were beginning to talk of the other
: : 	side. In the fall of 1974, journalists learned of Sar
: : 	Sarsdam, a village near Slem Reap, which had been burned
: : 	by the Khmer Rouge and in which, according to Catholic
: : 	Relief Services workers, over sixty peasants had been
: : 	brutally killed. Old women were reported to have been
: : 	nailed to the walls of their homes before being burned
: : 	alive. Children had been torn apart by hand.
: :
: : 	Even so, there were few journalists in Phnom Penh who
: : 	wanted to believe the blood-bath theory. It had been
: : 	invoked so often by United States officials in defense of
: : 	a policy with which most of those same journalists
: : 	disagreed, that there was a tendency in the final days of
: : 	the war to dismiss the United States Ambassador John
: : 	Gunther Dean and other officials who harped on Sar Sarsdam
: : 	as hawks who wished to prolong the war. Martin Woollacott
: : 	of the Guardian later recalled with pain that some
: : 	journalists sang a little song to the tune of "She Was
: : 	Poor but She Was Honest":
: :
: : 		Oh will there be a dreadful bloodbath
: : 		When the Khmer Rouge come to town?
: : 		Aye, there'll be a dreadful bloodbath
: : 		When the Khmer Rouge come to town.
: :
: : 	When the Khmer Rouge did come to town, in April 1975, only
: : 	a few foreigners remained in Phnom Penh. Closeted in the
: : 	French Embassy they watched, at first more astonished than
: : 	appalled, as the victorious young army began to empty the
: : 	entire city at gunpoint. Hospital patients, refugees,
: : 	schoolchildren, all had to take one of the main roads out
: : 	of the city. Most of the Cambodians in the Embassy were
: : 	ordered to leave its supposed sanctuary and to trek into
: : 	the countryside as well. The foreigners were then trucked
: : 	to the Thai border. From then on, the Khmer Rouge closed
: : 	Cambodia almost completely from the outside world and
: : 	embarked upon one of the most radical and bloody
: : 	revolutions in history.
: :
: : 	For the next three and a half years the few thousand
: : 	refugees who managed to escape to Thailand were the
: : 	principal source of news about the country. They told from
: : 	the start a consistent story of deaths from starvation and
: : 	exhaustion during the evacuation of Phnom Penh; of forced
: : 	evacuation of almost all the towns after Phnom Penh; of
: : 	relocation into new villages or work zones; of inadequate
: : 	food supplies and nonexistent medical care; of a rule of
: : 	terror conducted by young boys with AK-47s on behalf of a
: : 	shadowy, all-powerful organization known as Angka.
: : 	Refugees spoke of people being shot, clubbed to death or
: : 	buried alive for disobeying orders, asking questions or in
: : 	some other way infringing the rules that Angka laid down.
: : 	Among the dreadful tales they told were those of babies
: : 	being beaten to death against trees.
: :
: : 	Accounts of such atrocities began to appear in the Western
: : 	press in the summer of 1975. In London, early reports were
: : 	by Bruce Loudoun and John McBeth in the conservative Daily
: : 	Telegraph, the paper which had reported German atrocities
: : 	wrongly in World War I and correctly in World War 11. In
: : 	July, Henry Kamm wrote a long article in The New York
: : 	Times, and the paper ran an editorial cornparing the Khmer
: : 	Rouge policies with "Soviet extermination of kulaks or
: : 	with the Gulag Archipelago." Kamm was one of the few
: : 	journalists on a major newspaper to cover the Cambodian
: : 	story throughout.
: :
: : 	Clearly, Cambodia was not ignored. Its travails received
: : 	far more attention than those of, say, East Timor, Burundi
: : 	or the Central African Republic, to mention just three
: : 	other contemporary disasters. Nonetheless, it was some
: : 	time before many reporters came to accept that terrible
: : 	events were taking place in Cambodia. just as few people
: : 	had wished to believe in the elimination of the Jews until
: : 	the evidence was thrust before them, so many people wished
: : 	not to believe that atrocities were taking place in
: : 	Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge takeover. This was
: : 	especially true among reporters who had reported the war
: : 	negatively from the Lon Nol side, hoping for the victory
: : 	of the others. Far from eagerly seeking, let alone
: : 	fabricating, evidence of Khmer Rouge atrocities, they
: : 	shrank from it. Others believed, at least for a short
: : 	time, that the refugees were unreliable, that the CIA was
: : 	cooking up a blood bath to say, "We told you so."

Everything on the internet is a packet with a destination address and a return address.  To create a police state on the internet, all that is necessary is to ensure a one to one correspondence between an internet address, and a human face that can be beaten to pulp.

Origami world.
Computer generates a random 3D object out of large polygons with fairly sharp angles of contact, subject to various limits on the way in which the object is generated.  Displays 2D image of 3D object.
Human infers 3D object from 2D image, infers unseen portions of the image from rules by which the 3D image is generated -- for example that the object must make sense mechanically -- that it should be stable resting on a plane.

It was only stable thanks to massive government intervention.
You will notice that the recent Asian crisis started with a market crisis of confidence in government financial instruments similar to that which occurred just before the beginning of the great depression.
The Asian governments responded to this crisis by looking at what governments did back during the great depression, and proceeding to do the opposite of whatever governments did back then.
While the crisis of confidence caused some initial hardship, this would have swiftly evaporated as it did in the Asian crisis.  What really caused the great depression in the United states was Smoot Hawley and government intervention to maintain artificially high wages for some groups, and artificially high prices to pay those artificially high wages.
Similar wage and price policies in France today are accompanied by similarly high permanent unemployment, with totalitarian parties receiving a larger vote in France than they ever received in America during the great depression.  If those wage and price policies were accompanied by Smoot Hawley, we would probably soon enough get a totalitarian regime in France.
In Spain during the great depression, they simultaneously employed artificial wage policies, Smoot Hawley like tariff policies, and also massive Keynsian stimulation.  This had the interesting result that they suffered an inflationary depression, the first major occurrence of the infamous stagflation, and did wind up with a totalitarian regime.

Economists do that all the time.  It is called modeling.  Lucas and Lawrence Klein won nobel prizes for doing it.  I expect that other economists that I am not familiar with have also won Nobels in it.

I doubt that I could provide any source on economics that you would regard as understandable.
You are asking for a prediction of the behavior of human actors, predicting what people will do.  One can only derive "rigorous" results if one makes assumptions about how people think and what they want.  The most rigorous attempt at that is known as "rational expectations theory".
Rational expectations theory (for which Lucas got his Nobel) assumes that people will make the best guess they can about future behavior of the market, then base their present behavior on that best guess, and the market will then reflect that present behavior.
  This of course produces inaccurate results for obvious reasons, and economists attempt to model people more accurately but less rigorously by using "rational ignorance" and "bounded rationality."   All these are major areas of study in economics.

President Herbert Hoover, evidently, was not of the leave it alone philosophy.
During the Asian economic crisis, a crisis very similar to that which Hoover faced, Clinton WAS of the liqudidate and leave it alone philosophy, perhaps because the world has seen the consequences of Hoover's philosophy.  Everyone commended the Hong Kong approach, instant liquidation for any insolvent enterprise, with the bailiffs taking the pictures off the boardroom walls and cleaning out the liquor cabinent, while the Indonesian approach of resisting liquidation was met with hostility and eventually the foreign encouraged overthrow of the then Indonesian government.  The key reason the Indonesian government was overthrown was that it was stiffing Hong Kong creditors in the same way that President Hoover was stiffing American creditors.
Hoover's meddling had utterly disastrous and counterproductive results.  The result, as usual with government programs that fail catastrophically, was for the government to react to failure by escalating the program.
Stiffing creditors of course instantly dries up private credit.  Everyone stops lending, which produces a dramatic fall in privately issued liquidity, a catastrophic fall in the volume and velocity of money, which of course swiftly turns a modest recession into a major depression.  Of course that was only a minor catastrophe compared to wage and price control policy practiced first by Hoover and then far more forcefully by his successor.

I know vastly more about cryptography than you do, and people who know vastly more about cryptography than I are confident that codes that pass lengthy peer review by themselves and people as good as they are, are unlikely to be broken by the NSA.

To put this in simple terms.  A smart person with a modest computer, familiar with the long history of code creation and code breaking, can create a code that a much smarter person with a vastly more powerful computer cannot break.
The codes we are using were created by smart people.  We know these people.  They are unlikely to be part of a vast conspiracy to put something over us.

Been tried.
Without property rights to separate one man's plan from another man's plan, only one plan can be permitted, and any pursuit of alternate goals, or pursuit of the same goals through alternate methods is "wrecking", and must be crushed.
Without property rights in the means of production there there can only be one plan, and one set of planners, to which all must submit.
The alternative to private property rights in the means of production is a single plan, one plan for all, one plan that must be imposed on all, which necessitates unending terror, as we have invariably and uniformly seen in  > How does crypto-anarchy/libertarian/anarchy propose to deal with the

Anti pollution laws do not apply to government or to government officials acting in the course of their duties.  If the government spreads deadly pollutants everywhere, then the government is innocent, but all private businesses that somehow facilitated the action of the government, perhaps by supplying it with equipment, or by allowing it to confiscate the land which it polluted, or by having the pollution spread upon their property, are guilty.

Last night I was channel surfing, I saw an interview with a prominent title "Profiles in terror".  The anchorman was interviewing the Secretary General of the Hezbollah, an organization invariably described as terrorist in our press, even though it, unlike most Arab states, and unlike Israel, usually obeys the laws of war.
The interviewer asked the Secretary General about the conditions under which the Israeli prisoners were being held.  He did not answer.  Instead he said (from memory, not his exact words)
: : 	We have four Israeli soldiers prisoner (gives ranks and
: : 	brief description).  They were each captured on occupied
: : 	Lebanese territory (gives location of capture).  The
: : 	Israelis hold nineteen Hezbollah soldiers prisoner, all of

Anarcho socialism has been dead since 1938.  (It had the misfortune of being actually tried in 1936, whereupon it instantly became apparent that socialism requires a vastly powerful state in order to apply ruthless terror.)  Today's "anarcho" socialists, such as Chomsky, believe that the best way to arrange for the state to wither away is to first make it vastly powerful and all encompassing.
Where have we heard that theory before?

I think the Russian solution is the best.
They dump high level liquid waste in the deep cold salty waters of the arctic ocean.  This water slowly settles, and it will be a thousand or so years before it rises again.  In the course of that thousand years, all the non actinide radioactives will have decayed, and the most of the actinide radioactives will have settled into the mud, and what remains is diluted into an enormous volume of water.

We cannot provide all the medical care for everyone who might want it.  The question then is who decides who lives and who dies?

You cannot provide cheap insurance by punishing insurers, any more than you can provide cheap housing by punishing landlords.  It has been tried.  A law compelling insurance companies to insure the unhealthy will merely raise costs for the healthy, resulting in more people going uninsured.
If you want to guarantee insurance for the unhealthy without ill effects the TAXPAYER has to pay, and I suspect that if this proposition was put to the public, enthusiasm would be considerably less.  Indeed the Clintons did put something very like that proposition to the public, and there was little enthusiasm.

We can provide RATIONED health care for every american citizen.  And then who gets to do the rationing?
Rationing is popular in Canada, because the wealthy skip across the border to the US.   It would be considerably less popular in the US, because we have no unrationed health care conveniently nearby.

I of course am in favor of bombing federal buildings.  To judge by the cheer that goes up in the movie theatre during the big scene in "independence day" when Washington gets nuked, I have some company.

Stockholm syndrome.
Named after the irrational response to some terrorists in Stockholm.
When someone is able to kill with impunity, many people have a desperate desire to see him as wise and good and just, as more than human.  In particular the vast majority of people subject to his terror have a desperate desire to see him as wise and good and just and reasonable, no matter how glaringly obvious that he is a vicious sadistic and capricious murderer.  Even if he kills randomly without reason, for the mere pleasure of it, they invent good reasons for each killing.
Once he is killed, or his power successfully opposed, most people then seem him as he really is, but not until then.
We see the same phenomena in health care.  When a government with a total monopoly over health care, for example the Canadian government introduces "health care rationing" people love it.   When the VA (an American government operation which does not have a monopoly) rations health care, people hate it and are outraged and indignant.
I saw the same thing in Cuba since tourism.  In the interior, away from the tourist zone, I found that everyone loved their free medical health care system, and were very proud of it, though it is profoundly unimpressive.
In the tourist zones, where Cubans can get real medical care by prostituting their daughters to tourists, etc, many of them hate  and detest the Cuban medical system, and consider it one of the major evils of I attribute their affection for their socialist medical systems, (as I saw in the interior) to the Stockholm syndrome.  You are reluctant to think hostile thoughts about people who hold their life in your hands. Since Cubans in the tourist zone could buy black market medical treated diverted from the tourists only facilities, they were free to hate the monopoly medical system.  Cubans in the interior were afraid to hate.
We can see the same phenomena with the communist regimes.  Before the Soviet Union fell, people in the West were shocked and outraged if you said unkind things about communist regimes.  Now there is no problem.  "Hey, of course the Soviet Union was the evil empire, do bears shit in the woods?"

You do not live longer than people in the US do.  The hopelessly incompetent and improvident among you live longer than the hopelessly incompetent and improvident in the US.  Doubtless the same is true of people in prisons.
When the slaves were freed, their death rate similarly went way up, because many of them were too feckless to look after themselves.  Nonetheless, few of them wished to return to the old system.

It is an inherent problem with any democratic system, that it must be designed to produce and enforce a single definite decision on a multitude of matters where "the people" do not have any one clear opinion.  This leads to the well known voting paradoxes.
Thus democracy is inherently biased towards statism, towards imposing a single  solution from above on everyone, regardless of their diverse desires.
One solution to this is severe limits on the power of the majority.  The government should require a ten to one majority for any use force.  To collect taxes, incur debts, or expend money for any purpose, or to make war, should require ten yes votes for any no vote.
The problem is that those whose job it is to enforce such limits on government, personally benefit from escaping those limits, thus all attempts to limit government ultimately fail.

Transactions on the internet need reputational enforcement.
Most of us cannot afford the cost and effort required to generate a widely known reputation.
So we rent the reputation of a widely known entity, usually Visa or Paypal.
If that entity is implementing chargebacks, implementing a dispute arbitration service, as Visa has long done, and Paypal now does, then it must know us, and know everything about us.  That entity, being large, is vulnerable to the state, and so what it knows, the state knows.
Anonymous transactions must be transactions that do not require, and are not charged for, an arbitration service applying chargebacks.  Such a service is inherently cheaper than the true name based service provided by Paypal and Visa.
Internet shopping and internet auctions such as Ebay tend to require an arbitration service and chargebacks.  However many regular Ebay sellers have established a good name, and could successfully operate, and would prefer to operate, with a system that does not provide for chargebacks.
Similarly micropayments do not need a facility for arbitration and chargebacks, and could not afford the cost of such a facility.
Any entity that facilitates transactions tends to be the deep pockets party that gets dragged into every quarrel, and thus is forced to implement a chargeback and arbitration policy regardless of whether it or its customers want such a service, regardless of whether they desire to pay for such a An entity that provides truly anonymous transactions has the great strength that its no chargebacks policy is credible, that it cannot be dragged into the arbitration business against its desires and the desires of its customers.

The major objective of the intervention was to arrest Aidid, who whatever his sins may have been, was a hero of the revolutionary war against a Soviet aligned tyrant, and the major figure in the revolution that overthrew socialist tyranny in Somalia.  A major tactic in this US intervention was to forcibly close down presses and radio stations that gave politically incorrect news -- which tended to be pro capitalist and anti socialist news.
Bush's peculiar foreign policy was in line with some of Clinton's recent foreign interventions, notably his installation of a Marxist dictator in Haiti -- though Haiti is fortunately too corrupt to actually practice Marxism.  The dictator of Haiti is merely a Batista, not a Castro.  The same was to some extent true of Biarre, the muderous tyrant who Aidid helped overthrow.

You should also recall the "Alliance for Progress", which did so much to advance communism and socialism in South America.   It seems that the good progressives in the state department believed that communists were popular because the peasants were eager to participate in Stalin style collectives, so if the US would provide stalinist collectivism for the peasants, that would make the US popular.

Because the law is still unclear and ambiguous, and the government likes to keep it that way.
A plausible interpretation of current legislation, court decisions, regulations, and observed practice by enforcement agencies, is that code with public source code may be freely exported, and code with secret source code may be exported provided the government first gets to know all the weaknesses you are hiding from the public.
However the government could decide tomorrow that what we thought the law is, is not actually the law, and we are all going to jail.

  The upper echelons of Irish society did not speak Latin, and the inhabitants of England at that time did not speak Gaelic.  Ireland had never been conquered by the Romans.  Latin had long since ceased to be the language of civilization, and had become merely the language of conquerors.  Irish literature at the time was vigorous and thriving, while secular Roman literature at the time was non-existent.  The nearest thing to literate and readable works produced in Latin at that time were evangelical texts created Christian proselytizers.   The greatest literature of that era was Augustine's "confessions", which gives you an indication of how low the Roman civilization had sunk.   At that time people learnt latin only because their masters shouted at them in latin, not because there was anything interesting to read or hear.

In recent years US troops have been trained with some namby pamby stuff about minimizing civilian casualties.  Australian troops are not trained like that. They are trained that their first priority is to blow the enemy away as fast as possible, their second priority is to stay alive in order to blow away more enemy in future, and if they have any time and energy left over after the first two priorities, they might think about minimizing damage to civilians caught in the middle.
While that is sound training for war, it is rather poor training for keeping order in peacetime.
It is interesting that this draconian legislation follows rapidly upon draconian anti gun legislation.

This is probably a cultural change, rather than a change in intellectual capability.  The tasmanian aborigines produced no art, did not bury their dead, and their technology steadily regressed to earlier stone age levels, even though they were racially the same as the mainland aboriginals.
My guess would be that when the population grew to levels where they started to press one each other, they found it necessary to make use of specialist in tool making, specialists in obtaining rare and valuable raw materials, and most importantly, religious and cultural specialists who maintained relationships, and therefore peace, between widely scattered bands.
Those artworks that survived were placed deep underground, where they could only be seen with extreme difficulty.  Presumably they were there for religious reasons.
I would guess that in order to promote peace between widely scattered bands, religious specialists made some deep cavern a place of pilgrimage, and then, like the Pope decorating the Sistine chapel, hired artists to make it more impressive.

If you operate a bulletin board or a chat server, you are required to ask if those signing on are under age.  If they admit to being under age, you are required to make them prove their identities and prove parental consent.
I presume the next step will be to proclaim that usenet, IRC, etc are "loopholes", then that adult access is a loophole.  (Make them prove that they are not a child.

You commies always find socialists everywhere.  Supposedly Lincoln and Adam Smith were socialists.
The leader of the solidarity movement, elected to power, defined his primary task as implementing and restoring capitalism, a view that appeared to have the entire support of his movement.

The Unions in the US have never been socialist.  The greatest anti communists, most famously Ronald Reagan, came out of the US Union movement.  The US union movement has often been active in international working class organization, acting as the US government's right arm against non violent forms of communist political struggle.
Way back in the 1870 - 1890s there was a broad power struggle in the US between the class war unionists, who stood for socialism, and the "bread and butter" unionists, who aimed to embourgeois the American working class.  Some of the class war unionists committed unspeakable crimes against "scabs", discrediting their movement and their brethren.  They lost power decisively, and never regained it.
During 1900--1920, the US socialist movement lost its working class character, and came to resemble the modern American trust-fund kid socialist movement.

Yes it does.  Socialists may not always intend that outcome, but that is the outcome they are necessarily going to get, want it or not.
And the reaction of Western socialists to real life repressive governments shows that most western socialists do indeed want exactly that.  Their love of Castro turned to hate only when Castro liberalized Cuba.  They blandly overlooked the crimes of Khmer Rouge until the Soviet Union and its sattelites quarreled with them.
They worshipped the Sandinistas, while fiercely condemning Latin American governments that were vastly less repressive.

I have a theory that when people claim to adhere to moral axioms that manifestly they do not hold, they are up to something.  At best, they are psychopaths, who lack moral intuition.  At worst, they have done something or are about to do something, and are blowing smoke to cover their past actions or contemplated actions.

But in a free market this never happens.  It only happens when the government intervenes.  Thus, for example, we only see homelessness where there is rent control, we only see hunger where there is rationing and collectivized farming, and so on and so forth.

Probably because his testimony is not very exciting, and making him testify seems more like an act of harassment against him, than anything very useful to the prosecution.

Then you must have few friends indeed, for as far as I can determine, every member of the ordinary respectable middle class that I know reasonably well has committed multiple felonies that theoretically could put them behind bars for forty years or so, in the unlikely event that the prosecutors got the hots for them, and in the event the prosecutors found out.

You are kind of slow on the uptake.
The government has been using the judicial process itself as a punishment for many years, most infamously the PGP grand jury.
These subpeonas are a form of harassment.  I curb my speach not for fear that I will be prosecuted, but for fear that I will  be summoned as a witness, in the course of investigating a supposed conspiracy.
Recollect the great indignation during the fifties about the way the government used an investigation of an entirely real conspiracy, a conspiracy directed by a hostile foreign power seeking the destruction of the US, as a punishment against those of certain political views.

No, it was to cause cost and inconvenience to Declan, to deter people from reporting the kind of stuff than Declan reports.
It deterred me.  I have avoided mentioning the name of the person charged, in this list and in another place, for fear that someone might churn out subpoenas on the basis of a groups.google.com search.

Declan's news articles contain nothing that is not better attested by the defendant's own postings.  The subpoena is just routine harassment of political enemies, same as in the PGP grand jury, and some of the hearings on the communist conspiracy.  Repression as usual.

Hostile infiltration is common and highly effective within radical political groups, and is routinely used not only by the government against radical groups but also by radical groups with conflicting agendas against each other.
"Unmasking" is always disruptive, because one can never distinguish between an infiltrator or provocateur, and someone who is just naturally a stupid asshole.  However neither should we naively believe that everyone who proclaims he shares our values, actually does share our values.

There is good and evil censorware, and many in the censorware project were
more concerned with good censorware than evil.
The censorware project was a typical pinko project, directed at private
choice, instead of state power.
Most US censorware, in particular the censorware that I write, can be
uninstalled in five clicks of a mouse.   Just click on start, settings,
control panel, add/remove programs.   I would not be part of any project
that was otherwise.
Pinkos are fond of imposing odd meanings on "free speech", sometimes
interpreting it as a right for certain views to be heard, rather than a
right of people to speak to those that choose to hear.

It is totally unfair to compare mafia type organizations to the government.
 I have known some people who were engaged in a mafia type business and
they were decent people.  Their charges were quite low, vastly lower than
the government, and they only provided their services to people who gained
some advantage from it, in suppression of crime, or suppression of
competition, or both.

David Friedman lacks empirical data.
I have some empirical data.
My empirical data is as follows:  Information about people's reputations
tends to be poor and unreliable, since one cannot report satisfactory or
unsatisfactory performance widely.  The worst people tend to be discovered
and excluded, however because one cannot exercise as much choice about
those one does business with as one would prefer, one needs the
temperament, physical size, and business associations that enables one to
make credible threats of breaking people's arms and legs.
Among the better class of people, illegal entrepreneurs who went to the
right schools and refrain from taking opiate drugs, one relies
overwhelmingly on reputation and character.  However among the worse class
of people, fly-by-night illegal entrepreneurs, and people who take opiate
drugs, one relies heavily on the threat of physical harm.
Illegal entrepreneurs tend to become snobs.  It is the only practical way
to operate an illegal business.

Such a mechanism can be readily adapted to anonymity.  For example one
could have anonymous credentials proving that this person is a member of a

specific member of the group, but which outsiders cannot use to determine

While personal violence is an essential part of operating in a black
market, nonetheless participants tend to think in terms of "people like

trash, one breaks some part of him, or arrange to have it broken.  If a
deal goes bad with someone like oneself, one has a talk with him.  If the

Dark Unicorn:
The point of using cryptography such purposes is to make ones non compliance undetectable, or at least unprovable.  Trusts and the like raise a red flag.  You are generating legal documents that advertise your intended non compliance and explain how you intend to do it.
Further, if authorities really have the hots for you, they can apply pressure to the trust authority is all sorts of ways.  They do not have to comply with the law -- you do.   For example they could kidnap the child of the person holding the trust, and hint that in return for cooperation they will overlook the crack they planted on him, carrying a twenty year prison sentence.
Encrypted data with a long passphrase will resist any amount of pressure.  Legal solutions will not.

And I would like to correct the common misconception spread by lawyers that there are magic legal formulas that will stop the state from using its power as it damn well pleases.
The basic formula for avoiding inconvenient legislation is "ignore, do not confront"
Cryptography will do what no legal incantation can ever do:  Stop the state from getting what it wants.
The basic problem with any legal incantation is that at some point you must explain to the authorities:  "My actions were legal for this reason and that reason", explaining in inconveniently great detail what you are doing, and their response your complicated and highly informative explanation will almost certainly be to hit a few times, and then lock you up.    With cryptography they have a mysterious block of unexplained and useless bits.

The only records one is required to keep are those that you claim exist in some filing, for example supporting your tax deductions.
No one keeps the records they should, let alone the records law enforcement would like them to keep, and no one has every been punished for failure to keep such records.
If this law that you have conjured out of your imagination existed, everyone would be punished for it, for everyone has broken it.

As I mentioned earlier, we have already had both crypto and data havening situations, in the DVD case we had data havening while the case was actually under way, which certainly was defiance of the court.
Lots of people, among them various companies I worked for, have been doing equivalent things with shredders, selective backup, and so on and so forth, routinely destroying records, in part because excessive record keeping could become a disaster in any court case.
Everyone is doing it, no one has been charged.
There is no law against it, no legal precedents against it, merely a claim that judges will "look with disfavor" upon it.
When the first thousand executives who have been overactive with routine use of their shredders go to jail for their routine weekly, monthly, and yearly destruction of records, then it will be time for remailer operators to worry.
I am still waiting for some executives to be jailed for their policies of routine, regularly scheduled destruction of records.
It seems extraordinarily rare for people to be punished even for non routine destruction of records, unless seizures of records were already under way.  Certainly the people who data havened the DVD ripping code before the court order were not punished, even though those people had the intention of defying and ridiculing the courts.  Punishing people for routine record destruction is almost unimaginable, as is punishment for routine publication of thought crimes into irrecoverable media.

The claim has been made these cases are cites, demonstrating the correctness of of Black Unicorn's claims.
They are not.
To demonstrate his claims, he would have to produce an example of someone who was punished for failure to keep records, or for routinely destroying records, not someone who was punished for destroying records relevant to a particular case after the case against him got under way.
He has presented no such punishment, therefore no such case exists.
Therefore remailer operators and the rest of us can in perfect comfort fail to keep logs, we can circulate thought crimes into irrecoverable systems, and so on and so forth.
In the recent case about DVD ripping, the court was outraged by efforts to distribute the ripping code in anticipation of the court order, and before the court order could be issued.  Yet in the end, no one was punished of actions taken in anticipation of a court order, actions taken to make that order unenforceable, actions taken while the case was under way.
Therefore we can certainly take actions to protect thoughtcrimes while cases are not under way.

With the DCMA and "campaign finance reform" the first amendment has gone the way of the second.  Non political speech is not protected because it is non political.  Political speech is not protected because it might pressure politicians.
We have no precedents that routine destruction of precedents counts as spoilage, but we have ample precedent that any speech can be silenced.
In the nature of things, it is far easier to enforce a law against free spech that a law against "spoilage" undertaken long before any charges, thus as we move towards totalitarianism, free speech will go first, is going right now, and broad interpretations of "spoilage" will come last.      --digsig

What we doubt is that it is compulsory to retain incriminating evidence, or to irretrievably publish material that might at some future time be declared a thought crime.  We also doubt that anyone has been punished for such acts in recent centuries.

There is a trend to making everything illegal.  Your qualifications to read tea leaves are no better than my own.
By the time "spoilation" reaches the condition that you anticipate, we will not be hiring lawyers for their knowledge of the law, but for their knowledge of connections.
As everything becomes illegal laws to cease to be laws.  Increasingly legislation is not a rule, but merely a desire, rendering lawyers irrelevant.   For example biotech companies usually do not hire lawyers to deal with the FDA, instead they provide FDA bureaucrats with girlfriends, "consultancy payments", and the like, because the FDA does not obey any fixed set of rules or principles in dealing with biotech companies.
At the company I work for we have a big problem with a piece of legislation whose meaning is far from clear.  Every few lines of this legislation there is reference to "children", or "the children".    My interpretation of this legislation is "We care very much about children, and we feel so deeply we are going to bust some internet company for not caring as deeply as we do."   Our company lawyer has no clear interpretation of this legislation, and suspect we would be a lot safer if we opened direct communications with the bureaucrats charged with intepreting and applying this legislation, rather than communicating through someone whose speciality and training is in finding and making trouble.  We need someone whose speciality is being nice, making friends, and trading favors.  Even better would be to do like the biotech companies, and open communication through a compliant woman, and throw in a few consultancy fees.
In Mexico, lawyers are fixers, matchmakers that guide your bribes into the right pockets.  The time is coming for American lawyers to stop pontificating about the law and make the same transition.

Judges have never attempted such crap, and if they do, lawyers will irrelevant, and will have been irrelevant for a long time before the such anyone attempts such crap.
These guys (Black Unicorn and his cheer squad) are loons, and I cannot imagine why they post such nonsense.
The argument they seem to be making is that judges, legislators, and bureaucrats are becoming increasingly lawless, therefore we should treat lawyers with worshipful respect.  But that argument is completely back to front.  As governments become more lawless, laws and lawyers become less relevant, not more relevant.  As government becomes more lawless, first one hires fixers in place of lawyers, then whores in place of fixers, then gunmen in place of whores.   American business in general is moving towards fixers, biotech is already largely past fixers to whores, and in Russia it is gunmen.

And as any one can tell you predictions of how the interpretation of laws will CHANGE cannot be based on existing laws and court precedents.
In any case, you are backpeddling like mad.  Having dug yourself into a hole with improbable claims on mandatory record keeping, you are now disowning with great confidence claims you previously made with equal confidence, indicating your understanding of existing laws and courts precedents is none too hot.
What was previously a claim about existing law, has mysteriously mutated into a mere prophecy that future law might change into something like your original claim.
How about simply saying "I was wrong", instead of proclaiming omnicience twice as loudly when you are caught with your head up your ass?

My impression is that whatever his original position, in the course of defending it, he made claims that were ever more unreasonable, ever more flagrantly wrong, and defended those ever more obviously erroneous claims by asserting the vast superiority of lawyers, and our vital need for lawyers, in an ever more condescending fashion.
If judges behave as lawlessly as BU would up claiming they did, we have no need for lawyers at all.
If judges are going to behave as lawlessly as Sandy now says he was predicting they will, we will have no need for lawyers at all.

A few posts back one of your loudest supporters suddenly reversed course and proclaimed that neither he nor yourself ever took such an extreme position, (his typically polite method of issuing a retraction) yet here you are taking an extreme position  once again.
The only cite that could possibly refute my words above would be to cite someone being busted, since the behavior you claim is illegal, the behavior that George announces his intention to engage in, is routine in most well run companies.
To be relevant to the case I and George speak of above, you need to cite an actual bust of someone whose work is deemed a thought crime, and was punished for ensuring that it was distributed out of his control before it was declared a thought crime.
No one doubts that courts have broad authority to demand pie in the sky.  What people doubt is that courts have broad authority to punish those who have rendered pie in the sky unobtainable, well before the case began, to punish those that have rendered the demand for pie in the sky moot.
As I posted earlier in response to your claim of broad authority:
Glendower: "I can call spirits from the vasty deep."
Hotspur: "Why, so can I, or so can any man;
But will they come when you do call for them?"
You have not cited relevant examples.  We have actual legal precedents where a remailer operator was summoned before a court and said "Sorry, I do not keep logs." end of discussion.
They cannot suddenly turn around and punish one for doing what one has legal precedent to believe is legal, and if we ever get to that point, you will have been unemployed for some considerable time.

James A. Donald:
That is the ordinary course of business at Microsoft, and most other well run companies.   If the chances are we do not need this record, get rid of it, for fear it may cause trouble in future, as Microsoft was so recently painfully reminded about email.
If one keeps records, and suddenly someone sues one, and THEN one starts shredding, yes, then one can get into trouble.  If however, one shreds away indiscriminately, on a routine and regular schedule, one is in the clear.   As a remailer operator said to the courts  "Sorry, I do not keep Now if he had kept records, and then erased them on being summoned to the court, he would have had a problem.  But because he erased them routinely, no problem.
This is well known existing practice and existing precedent. Everyone does it, the courts run into it every day, no one gets punished.   If you do not know that, you do not know shit from beans.
If you deny what I say, where is that executive who is doing time for routine regularly scheduled destruction of potentially inconvenient records?  Where is that remailer operator who is in trouble for not keeping logs?
All documents and any documents might be relevant in future litigation, no document can be proven innocent, yet out here in the real world they all hit the shredder just the same.
Most people do it.  Most lawsuits are obstructed by it.  Where are the executives in jail?   Is Bill Gates going to jail in the current case because he now has his old email purged?
You guys keep telling us we are not allowed to routinely purge records, yet everyone is purging records, everyone has been purging records, no one is in trouble for it.  Where is the executive who is doing time for the routine regularly scheduled destruction of records and purging of email?
But if you routinely destroy records on the basis that all records of type Y more than X days old shall be destroyed, unless there is some specific reason for keeping them, routine, regularly scheduled erasure of logs, then you are not destroying them in specific anticipation of a lawsuit.  You may well be destroying them in general anticipation of the general possibility of lawsuits, as Microsoft quite obviously is, as most companies quite obviously are, but Microsoft is not destroying them in specific anticipation of a specific lawsuit, so they are in the clear.
Shred away routine and indiscriminately, chuck everything into the shredder on a regular schedule, as part of a general policy aimed at getting rid of potentially dangerous records, no problem.  Shred specific records as part of a specific policy of defense against a specific lawsuit, that is a "Sorry, we do not keep such records" is a defense that is continually used and continually works.   One only gets into trouble if one destroyed certain particular records in response to a particular legal threat, if one chucked out certain problem records and not others, or one chucked out records in response to particular litigation.

And had they previously dispersed these so as to ensure that they could not deprive themselves of every last copy, no matter how hard they cooperated with the judge, they would be in good shape.
Sure, judges can issue any order they like.  But if, before that inconvenient order is issued, you have rendered it moot, the judge is stuffed.
And existing precedent is that if you rendered it moot, not by actions taken in anticipation of that specific lawsuit, but by routine and regularly scheduled actions, they are stuffed AND they cannot punish you for stuffing them -- or if they can punish you, no one has been punished yet.

Another citation whose irrelevance demonstrates the absence of relevant cites.
The basis of the spolation charge was not that the dealer should have kept records, but that the car was disposed of when it was supposedly material evidence.
This cite, and the other cites you give, supposedly "open the door" to charging people for spolation for failing to keep records in the ordinary course of business.
Yet no one has actually gone through that door, despite the very large number of of people who do not keep records in the ordinary course of business, and the very large number of lawsuits obstructed by that failure.
Perhaps it is not a large stretch.  Yet it is a good deal bigger stretch than hitting Microsoft with a spolation suit for its new policy of routine and regularly scheduled destruction of records, and Microsoft has not yet been hit.

James A. Donald:
Might equivocate to a big cloud of complicated fog.  Probably will.  In fact it already has.
However there is a large and glaring gap between the legal advice that Black Unicorn is giving: telling us that routine regularly scheduled erasure and shredding is dreadfully unwise, and the practices of many leading CEOs, that routine regularly scheduled erasure and shredding without checking what it is that one is shredding (other than date, and broad category) is good practice and required.
In particular it is common good practice to routinely erase all internal emails.   This is a major obstacle to lawsuits, and is intended to be a major obstacle to lawsuits, and yet no one has been busted for it.
If businesses can erase their email, then remailers can erase their logs, and I can publish thought crimes on freenet and alt.anonymous.messages, and you lot do not know shit from beans.
Care to explain the obvious difference between good practice as explained by you lot, and the actual practice of good businesses?
If a bunch of people claimed to be highly qualified astrophysicists, and explained that for all sorts of very complicated astrophysical reasons the sun actually rose in the north and set in the south, I would be more inclined to believe that they were not highly qualified astrophysicists, than to believe that the sun rose in the North.
If shredding, erasure, and just plain not keeping logs is legal, then the cypherpunk program is legal, and remailers are legal.
And it is as obvious that the cypherpunk program is, as yet, so far, still legal, as it is obvious that the sun rises in the East.  Yet Black Unicorn has been telling us in no uncertain terms that it is illegal.  The most recent post of his to which I replied rejected the entire cypherpunk program and standard business practice as foolish and unwise.
They are going to bust Bill Gates for erasing email before they bust me.  Why is Black Unicorn telling me I should be so terrified of the courts that I must abandon the cypherpunk program, for a threat that has as yet not been made, let alone carried out even against high profile targets?
And what most are saying, is glaringly inconsistent with what black unicorn is saying.
But if it is document specific, and the remailer does not read the documents, and could not be expected to know their relevance if he did, then Dark Unicorn's most recent post on remailers is obviously full of shit.   The remailers cannot possibly be document specific, nor can Freenet.
Aimee's favorite citation, repeated yet again.
These cites are all "on the one hand this, on the other hand that".   No one has been busted specifically for a policy of routine document erasure.  When Bill Gates is in jail being sodomized, then we will worry.  This alleged law is not a law, or an existing court practice -- it is an opinion held by some people that has never been given real substantial effect.  If it is ever given real effect, they are not going to start with us.  They are going to start with the deep pockets.
Aimees favorite citation continued
More "on the one hand this, on the other hand that" fog.
Everyone knows why Microsoft's email destruction policy was implemented.  If that is not "bad faith", what is?
Show us some busts.  Opinions are worth two cents a bale, but only after they have been baled.  You can find an opinion for anything.
Nothing is going to stop big business, small business, and individuals from destroying records except some busts -- quite a lot of busts with quite drastic penalties, penalties specifically imposed for routine record destruction, penalties explicitly intended to put an end to the routine and widespread practice of routine record destruction.
No such busts so far -- therefore you are full of shit.
More from the cite:
This is, more or less, the guilty mind criterion.  Routine destruction of remailer logs, publication on irretrievable media, and the like, really are not evidence of the guilty mind.  Your cites are just rambles, each paragraph contradicts the next.
As I said, no busts, therefore it is legal.
I rather think they did want to keep them three years.  Compared to the typical reach of a lawsuit three years is quite short.  If they had made it three hours instead of three years, it would not make a large difference to lawsuits, but it would have made a large difference to customer satisfaction.   Throwing away complaint letters while they are still hot would indeed be obvious evidence of a guilty mind, obvious evidence of the validity of the complaints.  However throwing them away after three years still sticks a big spoke in the wheels of class action lawsuits.  Therefore it is legal to purge documents in ways that stick a big spoke in the wheels of forthcoming lawsuits, even when they are complaints, even when such lawsuits are obviously coming down the road, as they were in the Remington case.
No.  You are spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
This battle, if it is ever fought, will be fought by people with big pockets.  The courts will go after them first.  If they lose, then AFTER that loss, remailers will feel a cold  breeze on their testicles.
Remailers and freenet and the like do not need to think about this until the battle is ending.  The battle has not yet even begun, and I rather doubt that it will.
No it is not complicated.
If I search through my records and destroy certain specific records for certain complicated specific reasons, then those specific reasons can make life really complicated, depending on what those reasons are.  If I say "That heap looks pretty dusty -- I guess I am not likely to need it", and chuck it in the bin because it is old, then because I throw it away for uncomplicated reasons, life does not get complicated.
The question is simple:  Do we have to keep all records the state might someday decide it wants to look at, or don't we?
The answer is, we certainly do not.  If we did, Remington would have been busted for their three year policy on complaints.  Your citations just do not say what you claim they say.
 If someone sends me a letter threatening a to sue me, that is complicated.   If my remailer processes a letter carrying a threat, a letter whose context and relevance I do not know or care about, a letter I do not read, and cannot be expected to read, that is quite uncomplicated.

The great firewall of China is somewhat effective, but by no means as effective as the chinese government would wish.  The Russian equivalent is dead in the water.   We do not have magic armor, but, governments do not have magic bullets either.
To effectively repress, a government must be lawless.  But a lawless government risks either disintegrating, as in post 1990 Russia, or succumbing to a cult of personality, as in the 1930s russia.  A bunch of very old men currently keep china wobbling between these two extremes.  When they drop dead, it will wobble one way or the other.  Since the cult of personality has proved so deadly to government officials everywhere, they will probably choose the safer course of wobbling in the direction of disintegration.

That summary of those cases seems misleading to me.
You yourself have acknowledged that standard best practice legal advice is to routinely purge all internal email after a few weeks.
That does not sound not compatible with your summary above of those citations, and it is incompatible with the positions taken by Sandy and Black Unicorn.
Most of the postings issued by you three, particularly those issued by Black Unicorn, sound to me as if they were issued in ignorance of the standard and legally recommended practice, that you were unaware of standard best practice on the topic on which you were To repeat:  If it is legal to routinely purge all internal email, it is legal to publish thoughtcrimes on freenet, legal for remailer operators to keep no logs.
If it ever becomes illegal, the lawyers will go looking for records of deep pockets first, and go after the remailer operators later.   We do not have to worry about mandatory remailer logs, until after the lawyers have successfully enforced mandatory recording of all indications of deep pockets.

James A. Donald:
If one is operating a company, the guy who purges the email on the mail server is not expected to know or care what is of special relevance -- he just purges it by date.  If he knew what he was purging, and chose to purge one thing and not another, his decisions would cause no end of legal troubles.  The whole point and purpose of the purging is to ensure that those inconvenient emails that so embarrassed Bill Gates will be GONE, emails that most certainly were of special relevance.   The whole point and purpose of Microsoft's new policy on email is to avoid a rerun of the Bill Gates courtroom saga, so that there will be no inconvenient specially relevant emails about Windows XP in the way that there were highly inconvenient specially relevant emails about Windows Explorer.
And if it is legitimate for companies to avoid the Bill Gates experience by purging mail files, then it is legitimate for them to avoid the Bill Gates experience by encrypting with perfect forward secrecy, and all the rest of the cypherpunks program is similarly legitimate.
Defence:  "I am sorry.  All our email is routinely deleted.
All complaints corresponding to a single bug are summarized into a single entry in our bug database, and we have given you that entry.
This alleged message would appear to correspond to bug Microwave in our bug database, which we kept and gave you as part of your discovery process, giving you an accurate good faith account of all our knowledge of problems with our product.  You will notice that our bug fix database records our prompt and effective resolution of the problem to which this alleged email appears to refer. "
Accuser: "You threw away inconvenient evidence!"
Defence:  "No we did not.  We kept it for some time, then recorded it in summary form, to render a large number of events as a small number of intelligible issues.   This enabled our management to handle what would otherwise be an intolerable flood of information, and now it is producing similar benefits in this courtroom, since going through each complaint separately in the court room would have run up tens of millions of dollars in legal fees, which was of course your intention."
Do you think this conversation is going to get the company in trouble for destroying evidence?  I very much doubt it.  (Well it would if defense spoke so plainly, but like Herodotus, I represent defence saying what he means, instead of what he would actually say.)
More importantly that internal email from the VP of engineering that says "About the damned exploding microwave -- only customers that are so moronic they leave forks in the microwave and then blithely ignore the sparks, smoke,  and balls of flame for the next ten minutes get that problem -- serve the damned idiots right" will never appear in the evidence, even though it is a lot more specially relevant than any one letter of complaint about an exploding microwave oven.
James A. Donald:
I am unable to reconcile Black Unicorn's recent post, where he denounces almost the entire cypherpunk program as illegal by current legal standards and a manifestation of foolish ignorance of the law and obstinate refusal to take his wise advice, with the conjecture that Black Unicorn is aware of current recommended best practice in record keeping.
If current best legal practice in record keeping would delete those inconvenient emails that so embarrassed Bill Gates, then current best legal practice in communication would encrypt them with perfect forward secrecy if they had to go outside the Microsoft LAN.
If current best legal practice is to promptly purge old emails whose significance no one knows or cares, then current best legal practice is for remailers to routinely purge their logs.

Every time you say "no he did not say that:", he promptly says it
again in an even more extreme form, and you promptly announce agree with him.
That business about the "judge not being amused" is just the same
old argument "If you use crypto that shows you have something to
hide -- therefore you dare not use crypto".
Lawyers have no special qualifications and authority to make such
an argument,  and when they make it should be met with the same
ridicule as any other ignorant doofus who makes it.
Most big companies, companies with pockets so deep that they
attract lawsuits like flies, have decided it is better that the
judge suspects they have something to hide, than that the judge
knows full well that they have something they damn well should
have hidden, and those deep pocketed companies routinely, on a
regularly scheduled basis, in accordance with widely circulated
company policy, do all the things that Black Unicorn has been
telling us we must not do.
No doubt it is true that one can be sued for shredding records
that an enemy lawyer would have preferred one to keep, and such a
lawsuit might well succeed, but a jew can be sued for discarding
a ham sandwich, and such a lawsuit might well succeed also.
Companies with deep pockets, continually besieged by hostile

That is what he did say:  This thread started when someone
proposed publishing thought crimes into an irretrievable medium
such as freenet in order to render moot any future court orders
to hand over all copies of some item of forbidden knowledge.
Unicorn condescendingly explained that would be illegal, but with
suitable mystic legal incantation it would be legal to escrow the
forbidden information with some offshore lawyer.
Which is of course total bunkum -- for the court can be as
unamused by one act as the other, but the act that requires more
explanations and legal documents gives them more handles to undo
it and more reasons to put one in prison, and more inconvenient
knowledge about one's affairs and activities, generates more
legal costs, and puts one in front of the unamused judge for
longer, giving one more opportunities to get into deeper trouble.

Trei, Peter:
Eric Murray
I read him as saying the prospect of prosecutors extending
spoilation to include any act that we do not carefully record for
the benefit of those who wish to harm us, is so overwhelmingly
likely that we should right now carefully keep all records of our
sins so that we can hand them over to prosecutors in future --
that these methods, tactics, and technologies are foolish RIGHT
NOW, and RIGHT NOW using such technologies and tactics displays a
foolish ignorance of the law, and a pig headed refusal to take
sage legal advice.
Sandy compared the practice of purging old email (routine in most
big pockets companies) to someone who jumps from a ten story
building, and boasts he has not hit ground yet.  That is obviously
a reference to the situation NOW, not future repression.
Similarly one of them, I think Aimee, advised TC May that he
should faithfully keep records of his PAST ammo purchases, in
case that ammo becomes illegal in future, or someone commits some
bad act with that class of ammo.

The argument "Using X shows you have something to hide" is unlikely to impress in a world where most respectable middle class people have committed  multiple felonies theoretically worth seven years each.
Similarly, there is much truth in Black Unicorn's argument that the systematic destruction of potentially inconvenient records is illegal. However since many other things that large companies with deep pockets is doing are even more illegal, nothing is going to stop them from systematically purging records.  The
court will no doubt be unamused by Micorosoft's new email policy,
but it was even less amused by the emails that turned up last
time.     --digsig

Some of the recent FBI scandals were callous indifference to
human life and disregard of justice, but many of them were
carelessness, neglect of duty, and gross incompetence.
Similarly consider the CIA, whose assessments of the Soviet Union
were consistently less accurate than my own.

If the government decides to crack down on any one activity, and harm any particular small group of people, it is likely to have a large effect on that activity, and cause considerable harm to those people.
If, however, the government decides to crack down on lots of activities, and harm lots of people, it is unlikely to succeed.
Right now the government is cracking down on lots and lots of activities, and lashing out at lots and lots of people, with predictable results.
To be effectual against remailers, the government would have to give them priority over lots of other people that the government wants to harm.   There is a big big queue of people to be whacked who are not being whacked, and only finite resources to whack If the government moves remailers nearer to the top of its
priorities, someone else gets moved back away from the top.     --digsig

Microsoft, as a whole, is incompetent at security.  All
supposedly secure software coming out of Microsoft varies from
poor to worthless.  Does anyone doubt it?   They take standard
well known methods and make well known bungles in applying it and
customizing it.
We do not get to see much of the spook output.  What we have seen
in recent years is not good.
During world war II the government sucked up all the best people
from the open sector, and put them to work in the secret sector.
For example most of the words greatest scientists wound up hand
making nuclear weapons.   However, one would expect, with the
passage of time, that people who work in secret would suffer from
Parkinson's law, and this appears to be happening.
I would bet on it in the long run.  It is inherent in the nature
of government.  Without the market weeding out the unfit and
pressuring everyone for excellence, bureaucracies unavoidably
decay for well known reasons.

One of the reasons why Bush ditched the small arms treaty is that these days freedom fighters tend to outnumber "terrorists" -- the tide of revolution is mostly flowing in the direction the US finds quite comfortable.
The largest beneficiary of the small arms treaty would have been Sudan, a nation on the UN human rights committee that vociferously condemns human rights violations by the US -- also a country with widespread chattel slavery for inferior races.
US government policy is not all that bad compared with the
mainstream outside the US.  Many governments and newspapers take
the position that there are no freedom fighters -- that all use
of foce against any government, however bad that government may
be, is terrorism.     --digsig

The main world events that I have noticed is that President Bush has deballed the world gun control treaty, in part because it would hinder aid to revolutionary movements that have interests in common with the US, and that Bush is making unkind noises about the world treaty against tax havens and financial secrecy, in part because it would give the EEC too much control over international money flows.
The state has always been repressive -- and different states have always disagreed strongly over what needs to be repressed.
In 1376 the Holy Roman Church declared itself supreme in all matters of thought, and declared that any thinking not first approved and authorized in advanced by the church, and conducted in proper church channels, was heresy and/or witchcraft punishable by burning at the stake.  However, under the original treaty between Pope and holy roman empire, any such burnings required both the Pope's judges and the King's goons
(oversimplification, but that is essense of it).  Since Pope and
King were usually trying to kill each other, freedom survived,

All the liberty that there is in the world today results from the Dutch revolt, the Glorious Revolution, and the American Revolution.  No oppressive regimes, with the exception of the Chinese, were produced by revolution.
Every successful revolution has been a major step forward for human liberty (the Russian communist revolution was not a revolution, but merely a coup by a little conspiracy.  Same for the Sandinista revolution).  Even in revolutions that failed,
like the french, were the old system was swiftly restored by
Napoleon, the power of the old regime was fatally undermined.
The outcome of the recent revolutions in Somalia and Ethiopia may be piss poor by Western standards, but compared to the rest of Africa they are pretty good, and compared to the previous regimes, they are wonderful.     --digsig

A revolution involves mass participation, and widespread
spontaneous defiance of state authority.  A coup involves a tiny
little secretive conspiracy.   A coup is announced, a revolution
experienced.  Few proletarians in Russia had heard of the
communists, until they learnt they were the government.  There
was a real revolution in Russia, but many people felt the
revolution had failed, since the new government was still trying
to prosecute the war, and was still dominated by the rather small
group that had been dominant under the Tzar.  Then there was a
coup by an even smaller group against this new regime.     --digsig

Someone who does not know enough to issue the right win-their-confidence stuff usually does not care enough to issue win-their-confidence stuff.  Of course it could be she is merely incompetently trying to douse the flames she has incompetently raised.  The distinctive characteristic of an undercover fed is
that they are pretending to be someone they are not, and doing it
badly, confused about what their role is, and uninformed of how
real people in that role act -- for example her recent flame
againt ZKS.  Real people who are really concerned about the
security of ZKS, and really hate and fear the NSA, do not talk
like that.
Now quite possibly she is just upset by getting continually flamed, and is just putting on a rather bad act to persuade us she is on our side.  But putting on a rather bad act is also something feds do.  Incompetent acting is does not mean one is a fed, but if one is a fed, it means one acts incompetently.     --digsig

Strictly speaking, nothing has a single universally agreed
value, not even a single universally agreed exchange value,
though commodity goods come close.   Exchange value is a
discovery process, which can never be entirely completed.
Our main interest in reputations is that the value of
someone's reputation will stop them from doing bad things.
For example an auctioneer with a reasonable nym on ebay will
get about six percent better prices in auctions than someone
with a crappy nym. If one regularly auctions stuff, that is
worth serious money.
Now reflect that if someone has a good established name on
ebay he can sell it, which is why most sellers do not use
true names.  Of course the buyer, having paid serious money
for the name, will usually continue to behave as well as the
person who earned the reputation.     --digsig

If you do not like one guy's prices or wages, you can go to another, or start your own business.
Without property rights, the specialization of labor has to take place by something very like a state telling people what they must do, and what they may consume.  Thus to suppress capitalism requires centralized terror, and lots of it. Nothing less will suffice.  Been tried.
And indeed that terror is a large part of the attraction of socialism.  Observe the popularity among socialists of books by those who have murdered helpless captives.  Many socialists even name their ideology after mass murderers, for example Trotskyists.   One can hardly imagine some faction of neo-nazis naming themselves after one of Hitler's more prominent goons.
Similarly, when socialists celebrate great moments in socialist history, it is not the heroic battles they recall, but the murder of the helpless and powerless -- for example they recall not the last days of the Paris commune, but the first. Similarly observe how the Soviet Union, Mao's china, and the
rest ceased to be loved when the terror ceased.  When the
terror in the Soviet Union was in full flow, it was described
a glorious paradise where the concept of a policeman was
strange and unknown.  When the terror eased, then they
started to describe it as regrettably wicked, but nonetheless
a much lesser evil than the USA.     --digsig

Money in the US was largely privately issued until 1915.
Capitalism long predates government monopolies of money.
The word dollar comes from thaler, which a government stamped

away, one of many such stamping authorities.
James A. Donald:
The state is the enemy of property, not the source.  Property
rights in the means of production not only continued to exist
without state support, where the state was absent, they
invariably continued to exist in the face of massive bloody
state violence aimed at crushing those rights.  Always, those
seeking to crush those rights had to escalate far beyond what
they expected, then escalate the violence even further.

Rothbard is scarcely distinguishable from Spooner, Spooner very much in the same camp as Tucker, and so forth.  If you go back a hundred years you can easily trace a thread of alliance and ideological connection connecting freemarket anarchists very similar to moderns with the most socialist Back before 1910, before socialist terror and tyranny had been tried to any large extent, there was no large gap between socialists an anarchists.  Most socialist thought that only a modest about of killings and beatings would be required, most anarchists thought that the less property rights were enforceable, the more giving and sharing their would be.
In the period 1936-1938 anarcho socialism was actually tried, and therefore the ideology ceased to exist among all those familiar with this bloody and disastrous experiment, except in the sense that many mourned over its failure, though the brand name continued to be cynically used for an utterly different program.  Those who continued to call themselves socialists after 1938 reinvented and reinterpreted the anarchists of the past, giving new and strange meanings to their words to strip them of any anarchist tendencies, like Mullah Omar torturing the text of the Koran to make it mean a garbled mixture of postmodernism, marxism, nationalism, and the customs and prejudices of his home village.
The parting of the ways came earlier in the US than it did in In the US, socialist anarchism faded sometime around the turn of the century.  In Europe, it died in 1936-1938
The history of anarchism in the US is as follows (simplified and abbreviated).
Originally there was no real distinction or separation between class struggle anarchism and individualist anarchism in the US.
The class struggle anarchists encountered a lack of working class support, and came to be dominated by vanguardists. Vanguardism is of course utterly incompatible with anarchism.
The split started when Tucker (then the most prominent individualist anarchist) denounced vanguardist "anarchists" who had been murdering various people, among them innocent working class people, to advance their political goals.  The split became progressively more vehement, with the individualist anarchists taking increasingly capitalistic The vanguardist anarchists, which you would call left anarchists, became utterly discredited by their excesses, and this, combined with a distinct lack of proletarian support, made possible an anti anarchist crackdown which for a time silenced all forms of anarchism in the US.
The anarchist movement in the US eventually recovered, but the class struggle anarchists remained discredited by their criminal excesses in the US, and by their inability to maintain any real connection with the US working class, and never recovered.  When the anarchist movement reappeared in the US, it was dominated by procapitalist thinkers who grounded their arguments in economic theory.  The leading lights of modern US anarchism have been economists.  The socialist "anarchists" in the US is a recent European import, merely an offshoot of the European movement which stole the anarchist brand name, when anarcho socialism died in Catalonia, much as modern liberals stole the "liberal" brand name in the US.     --digsig

The reason he concludes "no malice" is that he concludes the
reporters really believed the US had used nerve gas, not
because he believes the reporters had truthfully reported the
evidence.  The edited Moorer seemingly admits to the use of
nerve gas, and another witness seemingly admits to personally
massacring civilians.  In the unedited versions, they do not.

There has been far more concern about opponents of the war
being intimidated than supporters.  Yet the nearest thing to
real censorship happened to Ann Coulter, for calling for holy
war against Muslims.  Meanwhile college professors loudly
complain that the occupants of the trade towers had it coming
to them for imperialism, colonialism, and oppression, and
keep their jobs, and a comic strip spits on the flag, and is
not dropped.
What happened to Ann Coulter is not censorship, but it is lot
closer to censorship than the fact that the tenured
supporters of terror find themselves mentioned as tenured
supporters of terror.     --digsig

James A. Donald:
The US, unlike the countries whose system so many prefer to impose on the US, has sufficient freedom of speech that that cannot happen without causing grave embarrassment.  Recollect that dying in battle gives very different honors, compensation etc.  If if the army falsified the circumstances of a soldier's death there would be mutiny in the ranks.
CIA deaths can go unreported, and probably usualy do.  Army deaths cannot, because of a system designed to encourage and recognize valor.
The low death rates in recent conflicts have made some people suspicious.  How can the US army get casualty ratio of something like ten thousand to one, when fighting against people with comparable weapons?  And if the US is made of supermen, why did it suffer heavy casualties in Vietnam and In my judgment the big change is the change from a conscript army, a slave army, to a warrior army.  Firstly this makes the soldiers more valuable to the officers, since deaths cost the army big money.  Every casualty means that the pay and benefits have to be considerably higher.  In a free market, the burden of hazardous employment falls on the employer, so the employer has an incentive to provide safe employment. Secondly, the apparatus of coercion that attempts to force conscripts to fight against their will frequently forces them into danger that a competent warrior would never have gone into, or would promptly have left.
With warrior armies, the losing side typically suffers almost one hundred percent of the casualties.  These absurdly lopsided casualty rates have been normal throughout much of
the last few thousand years of history.  These recent figures
do not indicate the US army is composed of supermen, merely
that recent wars have been victorious, and that the US army
is now composed of warriors.     --digsig

The alternative being a likelyhood of spending twenty years
in prison for something he did not do.  The fact that he
could plea bargain it down to three years is pretty good
evidence that the prosecution had no real case.
During the recovered memory hysteria, lots of clearly
innocent people confessed to raping their children.  The
prosecution in those cases was prepared to agree to almost
anything that involved a confession, rather than actually go
to court, and use any measures, including horrific criminal
threats against people's children, to force a confession.
Once a few cases actually did go to court, the scam was
exposed, and suddenly people stopped recovering memories.  As
the prosecutor's fear of trials became more and more obvious,
the plea bargains became more and more absurd.  Typically
someone would admit to extraordinary and hideous crimes
against their own children, retain custody, and have to pay a
large sum to the "therapists" who had obtained the evidence.     --digsig

It is a big project, to do it right, with a user interface that is going to be reasonably usable and intelligible for a casual user,  I would say it is about eighteen months full time work if done at home, and if done as a dot com business, a couple of million dollars.
Doing it right requires a reasonably competent programmer, someone with experience in producing consumer products.  Such people tend to be busy.  I have kids to put through college. Because of the illegality of likely applications, this is not a project that bodes well for making a lot of money.

In order to give value to ecoins, it is necessarily to make them convertible with some other currency, normally an account based currency. It is difficult to do this without supporting accounts.
One could of course have a pile of gold, and physically and in person exchange coins for physical gold, but it is considerably more convenient to exchange coins for account based money, such as e-gold.  It is difficult to make such transactions entirely atomic, because of the possibility that something might go wrong, requiring durable state.  We then need a database key for that state.  Such a database key looks rather like an account
This only works if the transaction is complete and final, for example downloading pornography, or for people who meet physically, and exchange physical assets for ecash.  If the transaction is for account assets outside the system, then the transaction must have state that looks very like an account, if only a transient The value of e-gold is ultimately maintained by physical transfers with a pile of gold inside a vault outside US jurisdiction.  It takes a great deal of time and cost to actually transfer stuff to and from that vault, hence the numerous intermediaries.  The intermediaries therefore find it convenient to maintain accounts with e-gold.
While accounts are not needed for many transactions, and should be avoided where possible, they are convenient for many transactions, and essential for some.

The difference between Stalinists and Trots is that the Trots
were from the beginning more extreme, more brutal, and more
contemptuous of ordinary Russians.  The original point of
dispute between Stalin and Trotsky was that Trotsky though
Stalin was too soft on the kulaks.  The moderate faction in
Russia were the Zinovievists.  No one outside Russia thought
himself a Zinovievist, all identifying with the more extreme,
not less extreme, factions of Soviet communism.
There once upon a time was difference between those you
falsely call anarchists, and the commies, but after the
incompatibility between anarchism and socialism was
demonstrated in 1936-1938, the difference vanished.  Chomsky
illustrates this well.  Wherever the masters boot smashes
repeatedly into the face of a child, we can always rely on
Chomsky to find a good word for the master, and demonize the
child as a CIA agent. Chomsky defended the Pol Pot regime in
Cambodia, the slave labor camps employed to pacify South
Vietnam, rationalized the Soviet reinvasion of Czechoslovakia
and Hungary as defence against US aggression, and supported
Stalin's attacks on Greece.     --digsig

I fully agree that a server sustaining play money is a good
start, but I see no prospect that e-cash could be introduced
without convertibility.
Cato recently had an article discussing the same matter as
Danny DeVito, at somewhat greater length.
The point that they made was that even if everyone was better
off for adopting some arbitrary form of fiat money as money,
it would not be adopted, because of the critical mass
problem.  With all existing examples of fiat money, this
critical mass problem was overcome by first issuing it as
convertible, non fiat money, then later suspending
Suspension of convertibility was accompanied by some other

be paid by paper, even though the value of the paper had
fallen well below the value of the silver, with the result
that creditors suffered dramatic losses, and debtors dramatic

E-gold now supports this capability.  Since one can now do

However the niche market where most people expect the
introduction of digital cash is internet transactions, where
breaking the defaulter's neck is not a viable option.
e-cash will be most useful for sales of information,
especially pornography in its more controversial forms, and
sales of rights over assets that do not involve any
accompanying physical movement of assets.

The Trots I encountered in Australia seemed remarkably
similar to the Trotsky that I found in the history books.
Perhaps that is why they called themselves Trotskyists.
The story of the Russian radical left is full of hypocrisy,
betrayal and murder. The story of the Catalonian radical left
is also full of very similar hypocrisy, betrayal and murder,
with the added twist that in Catalonia the anarchist
nomenclatura was sold by the anarchist leadership into the
hands of their enemies.
The differences that seem so big and important from the
inside, are small from the outside.  I notice that you
approvingly cite Huben's FAQ, whose central argument is that
the federal government is the rightful owner of everything in
the USA.

The Catalonian "anarchists" needed a leadership in order to impose socialism, resulting in such bizarre and amusing titles as "Anarchist minister of the economy".  This had the usual unfortunate side effect that the midlevel militants, the nomenclatura that operated the bureacracy, the prisons, and the killing fields, found themselves utterly powerless in the hands of their leaders, as was illustrated when the
leadership casually dissolved the local committees.     --digsig

In that direct reply McKay confidently announces that I am
lying, and confidently announces that he is refuting my
claims.  He then gives a long list of facts that supposedly
refute my claims, but which actually seem to confirm them,
then confidently announces I have been refuted.
McKay's evidence does not support his claim that Catalonia
was anarchist.  Instead, if his account and interpretation
was true, it would be evidence that Catalonia was a benign
dictatorship reluctantly forced to use a small amount of very
necessary terror by the wickedness and recalcitrance a small
number of those it ruled.
Even if his spin on the book was entirely truthful and
accurate, his version would not show that Catalonia was a
socialist anarchy, it would merely show that the nomenclatura
were wise, good, and popular, that the people were glad to
obey, and that the nomenclatura never executed people without
good cause.

According to the web page   it offers a lot better than that.  Supposedly the spooks cannot detect the presence of a secret message unless they have the key, or the original unaltered jpg.
Of course, to be secure, you have to generate lots of original images, so that the spooks have no original to compare wiht, preferably somewhat noisy original images.  A sports site is ideal for this, particularly photos of sports being played in the rain.

The capacity of police and bureaucrats to rob and kill does not depend on approval by judges and legislators.  Rather, the capability of judges and legislators to remain alive frequently depends on the good will of police and bureaucrats.
The legislature is in the same situation as a lion tamer.  If the lion tamer's whip should by some accident actually hit one of the lions, he would very likely be devoured.
I would argue that the the police did not start confiscating drugs because the legislature criminalized possession.  Rather, the legislature criminalized possession because drugs were small lightweight high value objects that were commonly in the possession of businessmen with little influence, and were thus frequently confiscated, much as the liontamer incorporates the spontaneous propensities of lions into his act, to make it appear they are doing things at his command.

This is somewhat unfair.  Ashcroft's answers were as bland and uninformative as possible, because he is being borked.  No matter what he said, it will be used against him, so the best bet is to say as little as If he said any good things on privacy, it would be used against him as gun issue is.  If he said bad things on privacy, it would be used against him as the abortion issue is.

In Sweden, Gothenburg, police fired into a crowd.  Arguably they had just cause.
But US police, facing similar circumstances in Seattle, did not fire into the crowd.
I do not wish to suggest that Swedish police are a bunch of stormtroopers.  They are not.  But the general trend is that the more disarmed the population, the more apt the police are to open fire.  That is not merely a matter of lawsuits and stuff, but an inevitable consequence of human nature.

This is incorrect.  The black panthers were torn apart because they murdered dissidents, and "dissidents" came to include anyone who wondered if Newton was snorting too much of the Black Panther funds.
The same is true to a greater or lesser extent of most of the other communist armed communist organizations.  The first target of those arms was always themselves, to a greater or lesser extent, though this was most dramatic and bloody in the case of the Black Panthers.

If they were the kind of people who could so easily be tempted to murder dissidents, perhaps the spooks had the right idea.
Perhaps.  The FBI by its very nature tends to do bad things, and we have seen some bad things done by the FBI to people who post on this list.
I took a look at a few web pages reporting COINTELPRO, and found them long on unspecified rumors about things happening to unspecified people at unspecified places and times, and very short on any concrete evidence concerning specific people to which specific things had happened, much resembling web pages reporting widespread use of slaves, or widespread alien abductions.
Now obviously we know of some real world activities that correspond to COINTELPRO, notably the attack on Randy Weaver, but it seems to me that there is absolutely zero evidence that the authoritarian and self destructive actions of the radical left during the late sixties, the seventies, and the eighties were the result of evil CIA mind rays.  If such evidence existed, it would have been prominently displayed on some of the web pages I encountered.
I find it much more plausible that commies did bad things, things characteristic of commies, because they were bad people.
I did a web search for KGB and COINTELPRO, to find a web page that mentioned bad conduct by all such agencies.  I found no relevant hits, from which I conclude that of all the people so vitally concerned about the bad things done by the FBI in the sixties and seventies, not a one is at all concerned about the bad things done by the KGB in the sixties and seventies.
Of course it is reasonable for people in the US to be more concerned about US spies that Soviet spies, since the US spies mostly on US people, and the Soviet Union spied mostly on russian people, but still, zero relevant hits?  I find that a little odd.  This gives me reason to doubt the sincerity, and therefore the truthfulness, of those reporting COINTELPRO

According to the FBI documents, a major objective of the COINTELPRO program was to detect when the Panthers did bad things, and use those bad things to generate adverse publicity for the panthers.  But we know the panthers often did bad things without getting any adverse publicity at the time, which would indicate the program was not very formidable at all.
An organization like the FBI will always find threats to security, regardless of whether those threats exist, and will always take actions against those threats, regardless of whether the threat is real, or the means legitimate.   We should not conclude from this that all alleged threats are unreal, any more than we should conclude them all to be real, nor should we expect the FBI's actions to be competent or effectual.
The FBI is doubtless formidable when its resources are marshalled against a lone guy with no money and few friends, but it seems somewhat less effectual against more formidable targets.

US law is often construed as encompassing the whole world.  US judges tend to believe they can punish anyone anywhere for violating US law.  This failing is not limited to the US.  The french tend to the same delusion.

We know the spooks do bad things.  They have done bad things to people who post on this list.  We also know commies do bad things.
The argument I object to is that all the bad behavior, the authoritarianism, the crimes, the repression, that we saw from the new left during the seventies is somehow the fault of the spooks, and somehow not the fault of the people who were doing it.

The rear window had been smashed in when they whacked the cop with the four inch steel pipe, or when they whacked the cop with the two by four timber. so there was no problem with chucking it underhand and sideways.  Plenty of room.  One is naturally inclined to chuck large heary objects in this fashion, because it is difficult to sling them overhand.  In order to sling it in frontwards, he would have had to chuck it in one handed, and it was too heavy for that.  In order to chuck it, he needed both hands, and in order to chuck it with both hands, he needed to chuck it sideways.
You try chucking a great big fire extinguisher.  Unless you are Arnold, you will chuck it in the same fashion.

There is a photograph of the fire extinguisher flying through the air at slightly above the level of the window of the police car.  Looks to me as if it was intended to go through the rear window, but is in fact about to bounce off the upper edge of the rear window. I interpret this as a photograph of a previous throw from longer range, though one poster has claimed it reflects the fire extinguisher flying OUT of the police car.

It was not my intention to imply that, and I do not think your post was Nazi related.
However, as someone who routinely gets in flame fests with real Nazis, both the plug ugly kind who claim the lesser races are secretly making war with us, and the kind that piously tell us "I am not a nazi and my best friends are jews but ...", I am no fan of Godwin's law.
You do not have to be a nazi to invoke it, but it frequently seems that way.
Similarly the commies routinely invoke McCarthy.

You are full of shit.
I went to groups.google.com and did a search for usenet posts using the word "nazi" Every single hit among the first page of hits was an appropriate and relevant use of the word nazi,   Typical fragment from one of the posts

If usenet threads tend to feature the word nazi, it is because there are plenty of nazis on usenet, whereas in published books the publishers screen them out.

This was incorrect:  Eight of the first ten posts were appropriate uses of the word "nazi".  Two were inappropriate.
Scanning subsequent pages, a substantial portion were bogus uses of the word nazi -- IBM sold Hollerith machines to the nazis, Bush's family did business with the nazis, etc.
Strange how such transactions are evidence of nazism, while trading with Cuba is not evidence of communism.
However although inappropriate uses of the word "nazi" are common, they are not so common that any use of the word "nazi" can be automatically discredited.

The twentieth century taught us many enormously important lessons about human nature, social organization, and economics.
Some people are very unhappy with those lessons, so they spin them, or find reasons to ignore them.  "It was not socialism, it was state capitalism"
Most invocations of Godwin's law are excuses for not remembering.
When someone spins the lessons of nazism in a misleading way, other people usually do not invoke Godwin's law, instead they respond with the opposite Most of the time when Godwin's law is invoked, it is an inappropriate response to an appropriate invocation of the lessons of the twentieth century.

EBay's primary asset is that it is a repository of reputation capital for buyers and sellers.
Naturally it will attempt to capitalize on that asset, taking a share of the value generated by your reputation capital, and naturally the state will attempt to confiscate that asset, and "correct" the information in that asset, to punish certain people and groups and reward other people and groups.  Misbehave, perhaps by selling thought crime products, and your reputation capital will be expunged.  Or, if you are a member of a protected group, unfavorable comments will be expunged.
Therefore, in the long run, people will find it more profitable to control the reputation information that they generate -- we will need a peer to peer reputation system.
Proposed system:
When I transact with someone, the auction client on my computer generates a record, containing proof of some parts of that transaction, signed by myself and the other party, stored on my computer. By default I make that record public.  If I like, I can add any comments I please to that record.
A key problem is that people need to look all this stuff up.  This requires indexing servers that keep track of all or most such records.  However we can have multiple indexing servers, which spider through such transaction records.  Thus the spider might start with me, and find all the people that I made public transactions with, and then for each of those people, find all the people that they made public transactions with.
A spider exercises no monopoly power, since anyone can set up a spider.

But those invoking Godwin's law seldom do so because the gravity of Nazi crimes is being depreciated by some comparison.
Rather their objection is that because the nazi crimes were uniquely wicked, and X is not uniquely wicked, a comparison of nazis with X does not apply -- in other words that the evil of the nazis was unique, so we need learn no lessons from history.
Of course the evil of the nazis was far from unique, it was merely one of the larger of many similar twentieth century crimes -- the armenians, the kulaks, and so on and so forth.
The evil of the nazis is not unique.  Over and over again the same causes led to the same consequences, and the only way we can stop it from happening again and again is to pay attention.

Secretive and conspiratorial organizations are exceptionally vulnerable to infiltration and takeover by other secretive conspiratorial groups.  This led to a peculiar situation among the numerous little trotskyist factions where each Trotskyite secret caucus contained an inner secret caucus controlled by yet another Trotskyite secret caucus hostile to the first secret caucus, and even though nothing much was at stake other than the official line to be upheld in pamphlets no one read, they invested huge energies in ever more complicated plots and counter plots, infiltrations and counter infiltrations.
It is entirely plausible that KGB has infiltrated Opus Dei, and Opus Dei has infiltrated the KGB, and both have probably infiltrated the CIA and FBI, who are also probably spying on each other.

Most of the murders are committed by blacks and latinos, especially blacks and most of the victims are blacks and latinos.
The black murder rate, though extraordinarily high by western standards, is lower than that of typical black countries, for example it is lower than that black countries near the US, such as Jamaica or Haiti.
The murder rate among white Americans is comparable to the murder rate among white canadians, and the murder rate among black Americans is comparable to the murder rate among black canadians.

Let us imagine the following scenario.  You are going to
board a plane.   Someone who is known to be, or plausibly
alleged to be, a supporter of the terrorist movements the US
is currently at war with, also wants to board the same plane.
In that situation, your views on their right to travel by
plane will probably undergo a sudden change.
The enemies of freedom, which this woman certainly is, see
freedom as weakness and fear, and use it against us.  This
creates the danger that they succeed in making us give up
freedom, as has perhaps happened in this case, but it is not
merely a matter of dumb fucks using terrorism to institute a
police state.  There is a real threat here, which has to be
met with real violence.
Analogously in Vietnam, the enemy mingled with the populace,
so that even with the best of intentions, US forces wound up
killing a lot of ordinary civilians, a problem made far worse
by the stupid "body count" policy, where young ambitious
officers, like the future Senator Kerrey, were apt to rack up
very large body counts by any means convenient.
Senator Kerrey was cerrtainly a mass murderer, and the
guardsmen who stopped her from flying were certainly thugs,
but the reason there are arguably grounds for overlooking
Kerrey's cynical murders and the guardsmen's thuggery ,is
that in the face of this quite real threat even good people
will do things that are hard to distinguish from the things
that bad people do.     --digsig

Not what I said.  Did not say a political belief was
unacceptable behavior, did not say Senator Kerrey's mass
murder was acceptable behavior.
What I said is that guerrila warfare and terrorism results in
situations where it is hard to distinguish between mass
murder and self defence, and hard to distinguish between
political repression and routine safety precautions.  Senator
Kerrey (Democrat Party) can claim, implausibly, that he was
defending against communist aggression, rather than inflating
his body count in order to secure advancement, and we cannot
prove otherwise, though it hardly seems plausible.
The guardsmen can plausibly claim they were taking sensible
precautions against an undeniably real terrorist threat,
rather than repressing someone for their political beliefs. We cannot prove otherwise, and it may well be true.     --digsig

Those who plan revolution always overestimate the pace of

Could have fooled me.  The predictions of imminent
cataclysmic national ruin are from our point of view more a
matter of optimism rather than pessimism.  Further, these
predictions should not be taken all that seriously.  The
typical cypherpunk has a small amount of gold and ammo buried
in some peculiar place, and occaisionally practices his
shooting and martial arts, but these are a matter of
insurance rather than real expectations.  From the smallness
of the amount of gold buried, and the rather second rate
accuracy of his shooting, one can infer he really does not
expect imminent catastrophe.

No, will not come true.
All wars are good for government and bad for freedom, but a
short victorious war against a far away regime is likely to
be less bad than most.  If we lost the war, and the war on
terror turned inward, against Americans, and became like the
war on drugs, then it would have come true.
As I write this, the Taliban appears to have entirely
collapsed, which will presumably soon result in the Northern
alliance killing Bin Laden, and probably his children,
relatives, associates, and everyone in his general vicinity.
Problem solved.  Perhaps they return to the good old afghan
tradition of the women folk slowly skinning the foreigners
alive.  This was women's work, since men lack the patience
and manual dexterity required.
However, a wise government can always snatch defeat from the
jaws of victory.  It seems we are going to do some nation
building, fresh from our great successes in building the
nations of Iran and Somalia.  Right now the Afghans are
chanting "death to Arabs" but if we stick around too long,
doubtless we will once again be hearing "death to Americans"
Of course, the problem with building nations is that soldiers
cannot build nations.  At best, soldiers kill bad guys and
break their toys.  For nation building something rather more
is required, starting with a consensus.  It would seem they
are fair bit short of consensus in Afghanistan, though I saw
on television that they are working very hard at it.
The Afghan economy is entirely dependent on trade and
smuggling, as it has been for the past two thousand years,
which is a bit odd for a land-locked country occupied by
xenophobic people.  When local warlords put up roadblocks to
collect tariffs every short distance, the economy collapses,
as it did before the Taliban took over.
The obvious solution is for the various tribes, warlords,
militias, and armed mosques to  agree on freedom of
trade and movement, and agree to leave each other alone apart
from enforcing that.  Needless to say, such a solution does
not seem to be on the cards, particularly if we "help" them
form a government with a bunch of UN troops from various
islamic tyrannies and one islamic democracy.
Afghanistan cannot survive economically if divided into
mutually hostile ethnic and religious enclaves, nor can it
survive politically if  one centralized unitary government is
imposed on this quarrelsome patchwork of very different
tribes, races, and religions.  It will be hard for Afghan
politicians to steer a path between these two catastrophes. For foreign politicians, it will be near impossible.     --digsig

People want immediate and final settlement when purchasing
rights over assets.   They do not want immediate and final
settlement when purchasing services, or goods that must be
physically delivered.  Rather, for physical delivery, they
want the final settlement to be as closely tied to actual
delivery as possible --they want the arbitration provided by
the credit card companies.
In such a system, the digital certificates must ultimately
reflect control over assets, in other words they must be
functionally equivalent to bearer bonds and, more
importantly, bearer shares.
Needless to say, bearer shares are illegal almost everywhere.
Any system that does what you describe must be located in a
haven, and will be met by great wrath.
Often repressive countries, notably Ireland and China, offer
very free market conditions to foreign investors, while
keeping the assets of their own nationals under rigid
control.  In this situation nationals furtively export their
capital, then reimport their capital under the appearance of
being foreign capital.   Havens are used to launder this
capital, and bearer shares and similar mechanisms are used by
the nationals to keep control over this seemingly foreign
Thus even if the system you describe is simply a more
efficient settlement system, it is also a system that will
immediately enable large numbers of people to illegally
escape repressive controls on capital.
Thus just as any genuinely privacy protecting micropayment
system will promptly be used to pay for child pornography,
any genuinely efficient assets trading mechanism will
immediately be used to escape governmental controls, and is
already illegal on that basis.     --digsig

The Taliban was not a spontaneous internal phenomemom, not a response to an outcry for law and order.  There were repeated, massive, and bloody efforts by foreign powers, primarily Pakistan, to "assist" the aghans in achieving law and order, and the Taliban is only the most recent, and most bloody, of these.
Far from reflecting a spontaneous desire for government, law and order, these various wannabe governments found it necessary to devastate and depopulate vast areas that they were unable to govern.
The Taliban was only able to achieve "law and order" with massive external support, and an ever increasing number of foreign troops backing it up.
The foreigners would first back one group to form a government, and that group would fail catastrophically with enormous bloodshed, then they would back another group, and that group would in turn fail catastrophically with vast bloodshed, huge areas devastated by scorched earth policies where they killed everyone who did not flee, then bulldozed the houses, dynamited the wells, filled in the irrigation ditches, attempting to make any area they could not govern an utterly barren wasteland where nothing would grow and no one would live, and then finally, after two very bloody tries, the foreigners attempting to create a government backed the Taliban on their third try.
As we speak, the British and American governments are quarreling because the British want to have another go, a fourth try.  Each try has been bloodier, and more
devastating, than the last.     --digsig

Anti capitalist anarchism, socialist anarchism, died bloodily in Catalonia in betrayal, terror, and tyranny.

The primary job that the military is trained for is to kill
enemies in war time.  Soldiers are trained not to worry about
collateral damage, not to worry too much if civilians happen
to be in the way, and they are trained to shoot first, think
later, and forget about asking questions.
If soldiers are used for law enforcement purposes, they have
habits that make them bad law enforcement officers and will
develop habits that will make them bad soldiers.
In guerrila wars, where the enemy is hidden and intermingled
with civilians, there is often substantial overlap between
military and police functions.  However, such wars have never
been won by the military alone, unless they adopted scorched
earth policies and drained the river to catch the fish.
Always, to win a guerrila war they needed a local militia who
knew the local people, needed a local militia to perform the
policing functions for them, to perform functions soldiers
are not trained to perform.
Soldier's are not only too dangerous to be cops, they are
also incompetent as cops.     --digsig

Anarcho capitalism corresponds to what any normal person
would call anarchy -- see for example my web page "Brief
explanation of anarcho capitalism"
Explanations of "anarcho" socialism are evasive, euphemistic
and full of equivocations.  When they go into detail, for
example par-econ, they describe in pleasant sounding words a
system more centralized and authoritarian in form and theory
than Stalin's was in form and theory, and often more
centralized and authoritarian even in theory than Maoism was
in actual practice.
If we go back to before 1936 there were various unclear,
confused, self contradictory, but undeniably sincere
proposals as to how to implement anarcho socialism.  Then
disaster struck. They actually had a go at it, with entirely
predictable results.  The contradiction between socialism and
anarchism was demonstrated with the usual rivers of blood.
Some became disillusioned.  Some reinterpreted their now
inconvenient past positions as standard socialism.     --digsig

When someone says that Stalin was not a communist, we know that person condemns Stalin for insufficient mass murder, and being too soft on the kulaks.
It is clear that Stalin was a sincere Marxist and a good Marxist theoretician.  He wrote some very clear theoretical explanations of Marxism, and he obviously viewed the world through that skewed and distorted lens.  He explained the core of his delusions most lucidly, and acted in accord with those delusions.  When Chomsky justified terror and slavery in North Vietnam, he used the language and theory of Stalin to justify it.  If Stalin was such a crappy theoretician, why is Chomsky using Stalinist theory?
The argument that Stalin was not a genuine Marxist was made at the time by those who thought themselves purer Marxists than he, who thought he was too soft on the kulaks, too bothered by foolish bourgeois morality, too reluctant to murder workers and peasants, and that Lenin was not communist Those who condemned Stalin for not being a sufficiently pure Marxist in 1930 were upset because in 1930 he backed off from mass murder and war upon the peasants -- though it eventually became apparent that he only backed off because the Soviet State was insufficiently prepared for that war, and might have lost it had it launched it prematurely.98
Those who condemned Stalin in 1956 never mentioned those elements of his repression that were most hated at the time

Lenin surrounded the cities to keep people and food from going in and out.   This was the first step in a program to reintroduce serfdom, binding the peasant to the land.

I observe the pigeons are just as tame in black majority areas, from which I conclude no one is hungry there either.  The only parts of the world you will see hunger are not very capitalist, and for the most part they have substantial government intervention in food supposedly aimed at guaranteeing food for all:  India and Sri Lanka are obvious examples, and North Korea an extreme example.

@_subject: Weaponizing anthrax 
The following is theory, constructed from readily available
public sources.  This theory has not been tested in practice.
Anthrax spores disperse in neutral water and most nutrient
broths, settling to the bottom so slowly that for all
practical purposes they do not settle.  To separate them one
would need to add a suitable agent to the solution --
probably acetic acid would do it.  Acidify the water to PH 4
or so, and let them settle out.  I do not know if this would
harm the spores, but spores are tough.
Take some sodium bentonite clay, let it swell in water to
maximum volume, and add water till it is nice and liquid.
The clay should be moderately alkaline.  Because the clay is
alkaline,  the spores will disperse in it, as they do in
clean water.  Mix spores very thoroughly into the clay.
Acidify the mixture with acetic acid till the PH ensures the
clay precipitates from the slurry  The clay should
precipitate out to form a crumbly precipitate which when
dried can be readily pulverized to very fine dust.  Different
clays will yield precipitates that have different physical
properties.  Have no idea what PH would ensure the best
properties of the precipitate, but one can test this without
any need for bacteria.
Now comes the tricky bit.  One could have a well equipped
laboratory to grind the precipitate without exposing oneself
to too much of the dust, or one could take several people
from some unwanted group, for example Tajiks or Kurds, put
the precipitate in a barrel containing granite rocks, and
have them roll the barrel around until the precipitate is
well powdered.
It seems to me that it is not very difficult to produce
weaponized anthrax with primitive means, except that such
means would liberally spread anthrax spores around the plant.
If the plant was located in the frozen wastes of afghanistan,
this would not be a serious problem.

If your lawyer advises you to plead guilty without a plea bargain
in place with a known penalty. or the charge bargained down to
something with a small maximum penalty, that advice is so bad as
suggest some conflict of interest or impropriety on the part of
lawyer giving the advice.  One would expect such advice from a
court appointed lawyer who is taking his orders from the
prosecution.  Even if you are guilty as hell and they will have
no difficulty proving it, you can bargain something out of them
by threatening to put them to the trouble of actually proving it.
Even if what Isabella Dixon says was true, it would still be a
shocking impropriety for her to say it, since she is trying to

You might have a point if some of the terrorists actually had been brutalized -- if for example some of them were palestinians that had been roughed up by Israeli soldiers.
They were not.
This was not an attack on America for any specific things the American government has done -- it is an an attack on Americans for being being free and rich, while arabs have inflicted slavery and poverty on themselves, an attack on Amercans for being American.
When two hundred US soldiers were blown up for meddling in  Lebanon, the US government go out of Lebanon.  The US public is not going to stop being American, and will kill as many arabs as is needed to ensure that they are allowed to be the people that they are.  If modest violence suffices, modest violence will be used.  If modest violence does not suffice, the process will continue till no arabs remain.      --digsig

Nonsense.  The words "terror" and "terrorism" came to have their modern meaning  when they employed to describe the policies of the government of France, and later the policies of the Paris Commune.

Webster: Main Entry: terï¿½rorï¿½ism
: the systematic use of terror especially as a means of : coercion
No one believes legislation, least of all those who write them.  Everyone believes Webster's dictionary.
If the legislators believed that, why would they authorize the president to make war on a country to be determined in
order to punish it for terrorism?
The word terrorism is most commonly applied to the acts of governments, for example "the great terror", "the red terror".  Terrorism is a public good, thus only governments can efficiently supply terrorism.   The use of the word for non government actions is a response to events in the middle east.  For a long time everyone took for granted that only governments can supply terrorism, just as many today take for granted that only governments can issue money or build pavements.     --digsig

Terrorism is a good pretext for taking away our rights.
A war to destroy terrorist regimes is a less good pretext, and if it succeeds, will remove one pretext.   The end of the war will also spark a demand for a return to normality, similar to the anti socialist wave we saw in many english speaking countries at the end of World War II.  Socialism, introduced under the pretext of war, was discredited by its association with the privation and authoritarianism of war.
What George Bush is promising, truthfully or untruthfully, is just such a war.  A war where the good guys storm into the bad guy's presidential palace, and then come home to a victory parade, where upon everything returns to normal.
All wars are bad for freedom, but the war that George Bush promises is far less bad for freedom than unending terrorism.
Of course the previous Bush promised "read my lips, no new

You do not need to live in a slum.
Indeed most slums are poorly sealed, and most poorly sealed
buildings have no mold problem.
If you live in a well sealed building, and are energy
conscious, and always keep the doors and windows closed, and
the weather outside is cold, there will be chronic
condensation on windows and and some parts of the walls.
Mold will then grow, very possibly harming or even killing
the inhabitants.
The recent attack of the killer mold in California is a
result of the recent big energy conservation measures.
The correct response is to wipe down the highly visible mold
with dilute bleach solution, then leave a window cracked open
whenever you see condensation.     --digsig

Their design, and the institutions and software to be designed around them, is disturbingly similar to what would be needed to restrict what software we could run.  TCPA institutions and infrastructure are much the same as SSSCA institutions and According to Microsoft, the end user can turn the palladium hardware off, and the computer will still boot.  As long as that is true, it is an end user option and no one can object.
But this is not what the content providers want.  They want that if you disable the Fritz chip, the computer does not boot.  What they want is that it shall be illegal to sell a computer capable of booting if the Fritz chip is disabled.
If I have to give superroot powers to Joe in order to run Joe's software or play Joe's content, fair enough.  But the hardware and institutions to implement this are disturbingly similar to the hardware and institutions needed to implement the rule that I have to give superroot powers to Joe in order to play Peter's software or content..     --digsig

In an anarchist society, or in a world where government had given up on copyright and intellectual property, TCPA/Palladium would be a great thing, a really good substitute for law, much more
effectual, much cheaper, and much less dangerous than law.
In a world where we have anticircumvention laws and ever growing patent and copyright silliness, it seems a dangerously powerful addition to law.     --digsig

The announced purpose of TCPA/Palladium is to introduce some
intermediate cases.  For example you could compile your own code,
and then encrypt it so that it can only run on a specific target

In an anarchic society, or under a government that did not define and defend IP, TCPA/Palladium would probably give roughly the right amount of protection to intellectual property by technical means in place of legal means.
Chances are that the thinking behind Palladium is not "Let us sell out to the Hollywood lobby" but rather "Let us make those !@ commie chinese pay for their *&^%$ software".
Of course, in a society with both legal and technical protection of IP, the likely outcome is oppressive artificial monopolies sustained both by technology and state power.
I would certainly much prefer TCPA/Palladium in place of existing
IP law.  What I fear is that instead legislation and technology
will each reinforce the other.     --digsig

I can think of two innocuous reasons, though the real reason is
probably something else altogether:
1.  Defending copyright enforcement is extremely unpopular because
it seemingly puts you on the side of the hollywood cabal, but in
fact TCPA/Paladium, if it works as described, and if it is not
integrated with legal enforcement, does not over reach in the
fashion that most recent intellectual property legislation, and
most recent policy decisions by the patent office over reach.
2..  Legal departments are full of people who are, among their
many other grievious faults, technologically illiterate.
Therefore when an insider is talking about something, they cannot
tell when he is leaking inside information or not, and tend to
have kittens, because they have to trust him (being unable to tell
if he is leaking information covered by NDA), and are
constitutionally incapable of trusting anyone.     --digsig

Obviously it is insane to use keys that you do not yourself control to keep secrets.  That, however, is not the purpose of TCPA/Palladium as envisaged by Microsoft.
The intent is that Peter can sell Paul software or content that will only run on ONE computer for ONE time period..
When the motherboard emits blue smoke, or the time runs out, whichever happens first, Paul has to buy new software.  If prices are lowered accordingly, this might be acceptable.

I can only see one application for voluntary TCPA, and that is the
application it was designed to perform:  Make it possible run
software or content which is encrypted so that it will only run on
one computer for one time period.
All the other proposed uses, both good and evil, seem improbably
cumbersome, or easier to do in some other fashion.  There are
quite a few extremely evil uses it would be good for, but they
would only be feasible if enforced by legislation -- otherwise

Think about it.
(Lots of similarly untintellible stuff deleted)
You have lost me, I have no idea why you think what you are  talking about might be relevant to my assertion.
The TPM has its own secret key, it makes the corresponding public key widely available to everyone, and its own internal good known
time.  So  when your customer's payment goes through, you then
send him a  copy of your stuff encrypted to his TPM, a copy which
only his TPM  can make use of.  Your code, which the TPM decrypts
and executes,  looks at the known good time, and if the user is
out of time, refuses to play.       --digsig

Your account of TCPA is that smooth and reassuring account given
in the TCPA FAQ
When I read the more technical account
 , and
.pdf ,
I do not see anything so reassuring.  I see scary
phrases like "root of trust".
These more technical specs give lots of irrelevant detail, and
very little detail that is actually informative.   We get a
mixture of smooth sales talk, and blind-em-with-bafflegab
technical vagueness.
Some of the details in the technical spec seem inconsistent with
the smooth and reassuring account.  For example:
: : 	"The replacement of code in the platform must be
: : 	performed by a platform manufacturer approved method
: : 	or agent.  This allows the manufacturer to establish
: : 	an upgrade method ...."
This seems to the say that the TPM has non read write storage containing non volatile code that is privileged, and can be
changed, but not however by the user.
This would imply that the TPM could be used to enforce any policy
whatever, and not necessarily a policy so benevolent as that
promised in the sales talk versions of the white papers.
You have told us that the TPM is turned off by default, but "off"
is merely an off flag, not a full physical off.  According to the
technical spec
: : 	"The core root of trust measurement (CRTM) MUST be an
: : 	immutable feature of the platform's initialization
: : 	code that executes on platform reset."
This is not what most people mean by "off".   It provides the
physical capability to prohibit unauthorized software from
running, even if the nice salesman tells us that capability will
never be used.

This prejudice is caused by:
1.  IP is already overprotected by the state, so any additional
protection will meet with hostility.

Sure, no problem, if the manufacturer is not acting under state
direction.  Let us instead suppose, as seems likely, all
manufacturers are directed to upgrade TPM with clipper chip
Obviously as long as TPM is not backed by legal force, it cannot
do anything very bad.   But the TPM technology puts my throat
where the legislators can cut it.
The hardware supports it.  The spec says the software and CA
policies will not.  The spec also says that both software and
policies can and will be frequently revised.
There is obvious potential there to back TCPM with anti
circumvention laws, and all sorts of unpleasantness.

Hollywood and the government, would like the internet to be like
television, a few big businesses steadily churning out content,
and everyone else passively consuming it.
Microsoft really would not like that, since, despite all their
faults, they are in the computer business.
This is analogous to the difference between Hitler and Stalin.
Hitler wanted to enslave the whole world right away, Stalin wanted
to enslave the world bit by bit as the opportunity permitted, and
whenever the time was ripe .
Thus it made sense for the west to ally with Stalin.  Trouble was,
Stalin thought it made sense to ally with Hitler.
My concern is not that Bill Gates is in bed with hollywood, but
rather than Microsoft may be trying to compromise, may be trying
to make a deal, over a matter where in truth no deal is possible,
no compromise can work.
Microsoft really does not want an internet that is regulated like
TV.  Hollywood really does.  Analogously Stalin wanted most of
Eastern Europe, and Hitler wanted all of Eastern Europe, and then
some.   Sooner or later, Microsoft has to come out on our side.
Let us hope sooner, rather than later.
Microsoft, like Hollywood, wants unreasonable and burdensome
levels of intellectual property protection, but they do not want
to destroy computing in order to get it.  Hollywood, and to a
lesser extent the government, would be happy to destroy
unauthorized individual and small business computing and
networking even if it did not help them sustain unreasonable and
burdensome levels of intellectual property protection.
This does not mean we should give Microsoft the benefit of the
doubt on Palladium.  It does mean we cannot automatically assume
that Microsoft is completely in bed with Hollywood.     --digsig

As TCPA is currently vaporware, projections of what it will be, and how it will be used are judgments, and are not capable of being true or false, though they can be plausible or implausible.
Even with the best will in the world, and I do not think the people behind this have the best will in the world, there is an inherent conflict between tamper resistance and general purpose programmability.  To prevent me from getting at the bits as they are sent to my sound card or my video card, the entire computer, not just the dongle, has to be somewhat tamper resistant, which is going to make the entire computer somewhat less general purpose and programmable, thus less useful.
The people behind TCPA might want to do something more evil than you say they want to do, if they want to do what you say they want to do they might be prevented by law enforcement which wants something considerably more far reaching and evil, and if they
want to do it, and law enforcement refrains from reaching out and taking hold of their work, they still may be unable to do it for technical reasons.     --digsig

It does however, enable the state to control what OS one can boot if one wishes to access the internet.
It does not seem to me that the TPM is likely to give hollywood what it wants, unless it is backed by such state enforcement.
Furthermore, since the TPM gets first whack at boot up, a simple
code download to the TPM could change the meaning of the
signature, so that the machine will not boot unless running a
state authorized operating system.
It could well happen that TPM machines become required to go on
the internet, and then later only certain operating systems are
permitted on the internet, and then later the required operating
system upgrades the TPM software so that only authorized operating

Lots of things get widely disseminated, often from quasi
official sources, for example "UN" documents, meaning some
document issued by a loon working for a quango working for
the UN, and never get denied.
For example lots people on usenet have posted all sorts of
things about me, that I am a nazi, was a Stalinist, and so on
and so forth, and for the most part I usually do not deny it.
If I do not deny such stuff, and for the most part I do not,
why would you expect Sharon to deny such stuff?
Sure, Sharon is a murderous semitic bigot, but the claims
attributed to Sharon are not characteristic of Semitic
bigots, but of anti semitic bigots.
Thus it is far more likely that those words were invented by
an antisemitic bigot, and attributed to Sharon to give them
added plausibility, than that those words, or anything
resembling them, were spoken by Sharon.
Semitic bigots do not believe that Jews control America.
Rather they believe that America and Americans are part of
the antisemitic encirclement of Israel, and that Americans
cackle with glee every time terrorists knock off a few Jews,
and that American schools teach that the Jews murdered

mattd and all the other pinkos and commies think this is the

In actual fact what happened is the umpteenth Argentinian
president in the last couple of weeks issued a ringing
denunciation of capitalism, and then told the Argentinians
that in order to save them from capitalism, he was going to
confiscate their dollars and replace them with nonconvertible
pesos. When the Argentinians understood just how they were
going to be protected from the evils of capitalism, their
enthusiasm for these measures diminished considerably.
As we speak, while the Argentinian government is implementing
all sorts of half assed socialist measures, the Argentinian
public, whatever their views on politics in theory, are as
individuals implementing the most radical free market cure
for their problems:  Dollarization.  The situation in
Argentina is akin to the situation in the Soviet Union
shortly before the fall, in that socialism is being
dismantled in practice without regard to government policy.
If, as seems likely, the Argentinian economy makes an
unplanned and prohibited coversion from pesos to dollars, in
defiance of government policy, the likely result is that the
value of the peso will drop to zero.

The high point of support for socialism among the masses in the US was the 1870s, give or take a couple of decades.
By 1900 socialists around the world had given up all hope of genuinely revolutionary seizure of power, and were pursuing conspiratorial paths.
The 1930s was the high point of support for socialism among the intellectuals, the privileged, and the elite.  Their efforts to foist their preferences on the American masses met with resounding hostility and reluctance.  Not only was there no danger of a socialist revolution, in the US or anywhere else, but in the US the leadership's attempts to force socialism down peoples throats met stubborn resistance.
There was more mass support for socialism in other countries, but no socialist revolutions in those countries, nor any danger of such revolt.  There were socialist coups, and conspiratorial seizures of power by socialists in other countries.     --digsig

A moment ago you were arguing maximum utility (your public good argument)  Now you concede utility, and argue rights, but copyright, unlike real property, is merely a conventional right, created by the will and power of the state, not a natural right.
If that convention ceases to be convenient and useful, ceases to have utility, we should not continue it.
And if you are going to argue from long established conventional rights, copyright has been extended by twenty years every twenty years, so it is not a long established conventional right.
Returning to your public good argument.  As more and more stuff piles up, the production of new stuff becomes a less and less valuable public good.  At the same time, as with any "public good", congress (being in the pocket of state created interest groups) creates greater and greater incentives to produce more and more of this public good.
If an anarchic free market underproduces public goods, government subject to interest groups overproduces public goods, a problem that is particularly serious with such dubious public goods as "defense", cultural or racial purity, and so on and so forth.     --digsig

Yes he will, but the big expansion of choice is for the the seller
of content and software, who will have more choices as to how he
can cripple what he sells you.  For example he can sell you music
that will only play on a particular music player on your
particular machine.
But that is not enough to give the content industry what it wants,
for someone can still break it on one machine, perhaps by
intercepting the bitstream to the the DA, and having broken it on
one machine, can run it on all machines all over the internet.
Break once, run everywhere.
Microsoft has also been talking out of both sides of its mouth, by
saying that this will also protect against break once, run
everywhere.  The only way that this can protect against
break-once-run-everywhere is to reduce user choice, to make it
mandatory that the user can only run government trusted software,

The plan, as envisaged by our enemies, is that first almost  everyone will voluntarily run a "trusted" operating system in order to view copyrighted entertainment.   The major capability of the new hardware will be to advertise to servers that trusted software is in control.  Then new hardware that is willing to run an "untrusted" operating system will be banned. After all, only pirates, drug trafficers, money launderers, and child pornographers are running untrusted software. Then only properly degreed people will be authorized to work on untrusted operating systems and hardware campable of running them.  The qualifications for being properly degreed, like the qualifications for medicine, will become increasing related to control and less related to competence.  Unauthorized possession of untrusted hardware will become subject to increasingly severe sanctions, and net access will only be possible through a gateway and proxies running trusted sofware.
Of course the flaw in this is step one -- almost everyone runs a  "trusted" operating system.   When step one does not seem to be  happening, it will be announced to be largely complete, and then  step two will be launched prematurely, and so will encounter  considerable hostility..

@_subject: DRM as a Smart Contract 
--
Voluntary DRM is indeed a form of smart contract,
If there was no pressure from the content industry, if copyright
and patent law was not expanding lawlessly and corruptly, in
defiance of technological trends, it would not worry me.
If the smarts were in a dongle that that you attached to your USB
port, or in a program that you could run or not run, it would not
worry me.
The trouble is that this idea looks as the a stalking horse for
the policeman inside your computer.
The history of this idea is as follows:
The entertainment industry proposed and lobbied for an proposal to
stop ordinary consumers to from having any more real computers.
They wanted legislation, the SSSCA which would prohibit consumers
from buying computers that could be programmed to do whatever the
programmer desired.  The computer industry went ballistic,
foreseeing that customers would refuse to "upgrade" to these new,
crippled, computers, and the proposal appears dead in the water. However it is the nature of businessmen to always try to make a
deal, so any such conflict will be followed by some attempt to
make a settlement with the entertainment industry, and
palladium/DRM seems to be such a settlement.
On the one hand, if the DRM is truly voluntary, it will not hurt
upgrade sales, so the computer industry genuinely wants DRM to be
truly voluntary, just as claimed.
On the other hand, if DRM computers are acceptable to the masses,
and are usually run in DRM mode, then IF they are widely accepted,
the computer industry could accept a law mandating involuntary DRM
in all new computers without losing sales.
 Thus DRM represents a marketing feeler -- it represents the
computer industry trying to see to what extent it can make
computers acceptable to the content industry without making them
unacceptable to the user.     --digsig

Obviously, the end of copyright may well mean a substantial
reduction in the proceeds from big movies, but it will hardly mean
a total end to those proceeds (the powerpuff girl movie is one big
toy advertisment)
How big an effect will a reduction in money mean?
If you go back thirty years, you will notice that lots of movies
were produced on a budget vastly smaller than todays movies.  For
example I noticed a Hitchcock movie where a car and a car wreck
was central to the plot, and most of the story line took place
inside a wrecked car..  However, Hitchcock by use of cheesy camera
angles, avoided any need for the car to suffer any actual damage,
or even the need to go out and buy a wreck.
Go back even further, and people do not bother with production
values at all.   Thus Macbeth says "why upon this blasted heath
you stop our way with such prophetic greeting?", presumably
because Shakespeare was too cheap to have a backdrop painted
depicting a blasted heath.
So the end of copyright will not mean the end of movies, but
merely cheaper effects, and since computers are making effects
cheaper daily, with imaginary landscapes made inside a computer,
and real landscapes massively altered, we probably will not notice
any effect at all.   The landscapes of Lord of the Rings, though
based on real landscapes, were modified beyond recognition in the

The camel's nose is already in the tent.
With the Dmitri Sklyarov case, and the DeCSS case, we already have bit crimes, where possession of certain software capabilities is an illegal act.
Of course, each software capability that is criminalized requires other software capabilities to be criminalized.  In the end the law has to legalize them all, or else criminalize them all.
In the end, the camel has to be wholly in the tent, with programmer licensing, a ban on the sale of new general purpose computers to unauthorized people, (expect a spate of television
shows with demonic computer salemen whose lust for profit empowers
international terrorists) and a ban on unauthorized possession of
programming tools, or else the camel has to be wholly out of the
tent, meaning a free hand to break such inconveniences as regional
encoding on DVDs.
The natural instinct of businessmen is to do a deal, and the natural instinct of politicians is to compromise and build a coalition, but the nature of the beast does not permit compromise. In the end, it has to be all illegal, or all legal.  There is no alternative to confrontation.  The MPAA already sees this. Everyone else has to see it also.   Anyone who tries to compromise will find that each compromise requires another, considerably greater compromise, in order to make the first compromise With Palladium, Microsoft is promising that they are in favor of it all being legal -- but they are building a tool that would be mighty handy in making it all illegal.     --digsig

The hierarchical verisign model is useful when one wishes to
verify that something comes from a famous and well known name --
that this software really is issued by Flash, that this website
really does belong to the Bank of America.  In this case, however,
only famous and well known names need their keys from verisign.  No one else needs one.
When one wishes to know one is really communicating with Bob, it
is best to use the same channels to verify this is Bob's key, as
one used to verify that Bob is the guy one wishes to talk to.  The

One : : 	approach is to make collaboration mandatory. For : : 	example, Freenet [6] clients are required to : : 	contribute some disk space. However, enforcing such : : 	requirements without a central infrastructure is : : 	difficult.
 The obvious solution is to monetize the darknet services, with
very small payments, payments that would typically ad up to
five dollars a month for heavy users or heavy servers -- that
is to say, a half a gram of gold a month.
Mojo was intended to do this but it failed, I think it failed
because they failed to monetize mojo before it was introduced
as service management mechanism.
We should get an anonymous micropayment system working,
interconvertible to real money, or real e-gold, then apply it
to such applications as mixmasters and darknet.
Allegedly yodel is such a system, but yodel is connected to
e-rand, which is connected to some people who fail to inspire
me with confidence.

The fact that your mum cannot use the stuff is only half the problem.  I am a computer expert, a key administrator, someone who has been paid to write cryptographic code, and half the time I cannot use pgp.
Of course, I have had real occasion to use this stuff so rarely that I suspect your mother would never use it no matter how user friendly.
The lack of demand may have something to do with Hettinga's rant, that all cryptography is financial cryptography.  As I am fond of pointing out, envelopes were first invented to contain records of goods and payments.  People use encryption when
money is at stake.  If people start routinely making binding

I am a really big fan of "Buffy".  A cute chick, lots of violence and killing, and a bit of sex, what more can one ask for in a TV show?   Recently due to family crisis, I missed a couple of shows.  So, using usenet, I downloaded the two one hour shows that I missed.  I had no problem getting them, the download ran in the background.  It did not seem to take an unreasonably long time, though I did not bother to time it.  I started the download, proceeded to do other things, and when I remembered to check, the download was done.   So I then watched the shows.  The image and sound quality was excellent, the ads had been deleted.  The stories were rattling good.  Loved the bit where buffy says "I am the law", and picks up a great big naked sword and stalks off to apply the instant death penalty, while Xander flutters about ineffectually being deeply caring and emotional and having deep moral debates about the use of I have never downloaded a tv show off the internet before. Everything just worked, no fuss, unlike some encryption programs I could mention.
My experience is that the mass media are doomed.  This stuff works just great for me.   I have stopped downloading music until I organize the music I already have.   Napster was just great, worked with no fuss.  Maybe the Napster clones are not as good, but my experience with downloading TV shows suggests that piracy is working better than ever.     --digsig

References: <000201c2627e$dcd8c3f0$6501a8c0
    --
The biggest application of smart cards that I know of are
anonymous phone minutes.  In Australia, I walked into a
hardware store in the middle of the back of beyond, and asked
the sales kid about a cellular phone for someone who would not
be in Australia very long.  He promptly urged me to buy a phone
that uses one of these cards, pointing out as one of the
advantages that I buy the minutes for cash, and that no one
would know who was associated with the number, other than those
that I wished to know.   This guy was a random saleskid in the
backblocks of Australia, not a noted cypherpunk poster.
Increasingly however, we see smartcard interfaces sold for PCs.
What for, I wonder?
In general, a smartcard and a PC smartcard interface can be
used anywhere where one would use a password, providing greater
security and ease of use than mere passwords.  By and large,
people only care about greater security when the password is
protecting money, considerable lumps of money.
A huge number of web pages are selling smart card readers for
PCs, for example: Obviously end users are buying this stuff.  What are they
buying smartcard readers for?
So I did a google search for web pages selling "chipdrive
extern" (the most popular smartcard interface for PCs)  Seems
like this is big business -- that huge numbers of these widgets
are made and sold. yet most of the web pages seemed curiously
vague as to what anyone was buying them for.
I clicked on a link that said "current smart card industry
news" -- the page was empty.
I found another page that advertised
: :	  "The Key to Secure eCommerce"
: :
: :	  The eCode solution provides secure remote
: :	  identification and digital signatures for
: :	  e-banking, telephone and mobile banking and other
: :	  application where secure identification is needed.
: :
: :	  The eCode system offers user authentication, user
: :	  authorisation, data integrity, data
: :	  confidentiality and non-repudiation.
A related web page says
: :	Argos Mini is a cost-efficient smart card reader for
: :	the mass market and applications like Internet
: :	Banking, Telecommuting, Access Control, loading
: :	Electronic Purse, etc.
So we are seeing lots of publicity from people selling smart
cards readers but curiously little from those applying them to
particular purposes.
Mondex, as far as I know, sank with very little trace.  They
seem to have given up attempting to issue electronic money
based on smartcards, and instead have become just another
company selling smart card readers and software, their biggest
contribution being a smartcard operating system that should
allow multiple applications to use the same smartcard, so that
a smartcard can act both as a purse and keyring, carrying keys
to many different things.  This seems to imply that so many
diverse people are finding uses to for smartcard enabled PCs
that one is likely to use a smartcard to interact with security
from many independent vendors, just as one is likely to have a
lot of unrelated keys on one's keyring.
If this is so big, and it does seem to be big, how come I do
not know of any applications?  The multiplicity of smartcard
interface vendors, and the struggle over the problem of using a
single smartcard for multiple unrelated purposes, suggests a
multitude of widely used purposes, yet I have no purposes.
Huge numbers of people must be buying these things, often for
multiple independent reasons, yet what are those reasons?
What would that kid in Australia buy one of these things for?

I have found that the administrative costs of PKI are   intolerable. End users do not really understand crypto, and so will fuck up. Only engineers can really control a PKI   certificate, and for the most part they just do not.
In principle the thingness of a smartcard should reduce   administrative costs to a low level -- they should supposedly  act like a purse, a key, a credit card, hence near zero user   training required.  The simulated thingness created by   cryptographic cleverness should be manifested to the user as   physical thingness of the card.
Suppose, for example, we had working Chaumian digicash.  Now   imagine how much trouble the average end user is going to get  into with backups, and with moving digicash from one computer  to another.  If all unused Chaumian tokens live in a smartcard, one might expect the problem to vanish.  The purselike   character of the card sustains the coin like character of   Chaumian tokens.
Of course if one has to supply the correct driver for the smart card, then the administration problem reappears.
USB smartcard interfaces could solve this problem.   Just plug them in, and bingo, it should just go.  Ummh, wait a moment, go where, do what?  What happens when one plugs in a USB smartcard
Still, making crypto embodied in smart cards intelligible to   the masses would seem to be a soluble problem, even if not yet solved, whereas software only crypto is always going to boggle the masses.        --digsig

You have failed to read the article -- he tells us when he wrote it. Read his article, and fit the timeline of the events he describes, against the timeline of events the other article describes.  The time at which he claims to have visited the airport in his account was an hour or two before the attack began in the mainstream account.
If he was merely telling us the US had not taken, or was not attacking, the airport, that would be no problem, but his claim was that the US was nowhere near the airport, the airport was in no imminent danger of falling, or even of being attacked, that in the unlikely event that the US had reached the outskirts, they had fled or been driven back.

I do not think you have read the article.
Here is Fisk's article Here is the mainstream article They contradict each other.  Therefore one or both is lying.  Since we now have good cause to believe the mainstream article true, it follows that Robert Fisk is lying.
Probably Fisk did not know where the American forces were, but he assured the reader, with great confidence, that he did know.
He claimed to have confirmed Baghdad Bob's account -- the account of the Iraqi minister of information, an account that events proved to be hilariously false.  In this article Fisk claims, claims with enormous confidence and certainty, to confirm a speech by Baghdad Bob that caused much hilarity among those less credulous.      --digsig

The attack taking place within hours is not consistent with
Fisk's report.
Fisk did not merely claim that no attack was taking place.  No
one claimed an attack was taking place.
Fisk claimed to have exposed the Americans as lying, and
confirmed Baghdad Bob as telling the truth, in that supposedly
US troops were nowhere near the airport.
Fisk issued a bunch of rhetoric similar to that of Baghdad Bob:
That someone, possibly Fisk (though I suspect him to be in
England, not Baghdad), wandered through an airport lounge and
saw no scenes of battle is doubtless true -- since the pentagon
did not claim to be attacking the airport at that time.  That
Baghdad Bob was right about the location of US troops was not
true.  That the Americans were lying about the location of US
troops was not true.     --digsig

The Sun Sentinel reports it being attacked with heavy Iraqi
casualties within hours of Baghdad Bob's making the claims that
Robert Fisk endorsed,and falling later that night.
Fisk tells us that the Iraqi minister was right and the Americans were wrong, that the Americans had been caught lying The Sun Sentinal reports that the Iraqi minister (Baghdad Bob) was wrong, the Americans were right, and the Baghdad Bob was caught lying.
You are splitting legalistic hairs.   If Fisk is telling the truth, the Sun Sentinel is lying.  If the Sun Sentinel is telling the truth, Fisk is lying,  Subsequent events give us good cause to believe the Sun Sentinel was telling the truth, and that Baghdad Bob was lying extravagantly and ridiculously.
And if Baghdad Bob was lying, which today everyone, including Fisk, agrees, then Fisk was lying, for Fisk told us that the Iraqi minister was right and the Americans were wrong, that the Americans had been caught lying.

A truthful report would have read as follows:
Instead, Fisk conspicuously fails to mention that the minders  are controlling the newsmen in a way that prevents them from  knowing what he claims to know, and instead proclaims that the minister is telling the truth, and the US lying
Fisk omits critical facts, and confidently claims to know what he was not permitted to know.
The one is a lie of omission, the other a lie of commission.   Fisk conceals from his readers the fact that it is impossible to check on the lies of a totalitarian state, and denies barefaced the fact that promises to allow such checking are always lies.      --digsig

Observe that as the regime falls, Iraqis behave like American blacks, which suggests that the cause of the problem is the welfare state, rather than racism or genetics.  This conjecture is also supported by the fact that black people did not start burning their homes and neighbourhoods until after the war on Given the right environment -- the US permits capitalism but steals all the oil, the Iraqis have the potential to become civilized.  I was hugely impressed by the released POWs marching home.   The Kurds took their weapons, stole their shoes and did not give them any food, but they were happy about the prospect of walking hundreds of miles through the desert with no shoes and no food, because they were going home.  They looked to me like people who when they got home would promptly set to finding work.
Unfortunately, if the US steals the oil, though it would doubtless be good for the Iraqis, it would be bad for the US, because any government bureaucracy that gets its own income source goes even further out of control.
Socialism is keeping Arabs poor.  Because oil fits the socialist model of wealth as something to be distributed, rather than produced, oil encourages socialism.
Oil is an attractive nuisance.  Attracts gangs of men with guns.  While Iraq has oil, Iraqis do not have oil and never will.  Observe the richest newly developed countries are those with absolutely zero resources, Hong Kong with nothing but rock, Singapore with nothing but sandbanks.
Better to burn it all.     --digsig

"James A. Donald":
One says the Iraqi minister of information told the truth at  his conference on the third of April, and the US lying in its press release of thursday the third of April, the other says the US telling the truth, and the Iraqi information minister lying on the third of April
The US claimed on the third of April that US forces were on the outskirts of the airport.  The minister of information  responded on the third of April claiming that US forces were  nowhere near the airport.
So you interpret the article as Fisk truthfully saying he was  unable to check the claims of the Iraqi information minister?  But that interpretation contradicts not only the overall tone  and impression of Fisk's article, but also the plain words of  the article, which proclaimed the minister of information to be telling the truth, and the Americans to be lying.
The question at issue is not when US forces took the airport,  but when US forces reached "the outskirts" of the airport.
Fisk lied.
The US reached "the outskirts" of the airport on the morning of thursday the third of April.  The US announced this, referring to "the outskirts of the airport", the minister denied it, and Fisk claimed to confirm the ministers denial, though in reality no newsmen were permitted to check the minister's claims.
The US claim (3rd April) was that Americans were on "the  outskirts".   The minister of information did not merely deny  that American troops were relaxing in the airport lounge, he  denied that US troops were anywhere near the airport. The goons from the ministry of information did not permit the newsmen to see the outskirts, a most curious restraint, a restraint that  Fisk neglects to mention.
Yes, fog of war and all that.  But Fisk did not merely say that he did not know, he said he did know, and supported that  pretended knowledge by deceptively omitting crucial facts --  that the newsmen got a guided tour to the airport lounge and  back to Baghdad, a tour that curiously that omitted any  opportunity to check the facts in dispute, curiously failed to show what had been promised would be shown.  The fact that the newsmen were not taken around the outskirts shows that had they been taken there, they would have encountered US troops.
Obviously, if US troops had not been massing on the outskirts  of the airport, preparatory to taking it, the guided tour would have included the outskirts, since on the third of April, the  outskirts were the issue in dispute.
Assuming he is Baghdad at all, which I very much doubt, why no mention of the Ministry of information minders?   If he did not love totalitarian terror regimes, why omit this crucial fact?  Saudi Arabia is a kleptocracy.  Baathism is totalitarian.  The fact that you are unaware of this shows where Fisk's heart  lies.  He wants a world of slavery and terror.
The old moral equivalence deal.  Stalin supposedly equals  McCarthy.  But they were not morally equivalent, and he did not merely say he thought they were untrue, he claimed to have seen with his own eyes that one of those "pieces of US propaganda"  was untrue, when we now know it was true.  US troops *were* on the outskirts, and were massing preparatory to an attack which took place shortly after the journalists visit.
No, the Americans were saying "we have reached the outskirts of Baghdad airport", and Fisk was saying "Americans have not  reached the outskirts of Baghdad airport."  But now we know  they had reached the outskirts of Baghdad airport.
But Fisk adds authority to his opinions by claiming to report  from Baghdad.
He assured his readers that US troops were not on the outskirts of Baghdad airport, but they were on the outskirts of Baghdad  airport.  By omitting to mention the journalists were taken on a guided tour by Ministry of information minders, a tour that  conspicuously failed to show them the outskirts, he gave his  readers an entirely false impression of what was in front of  those journalists.  As to what was in front of him, I suspect  his desk in England.
Full of commies.  Lunatic fringe totalitarians, adherents of a dying religion, sticking to the edicts of a dead party.  They  are starting to blend in with flying saucerists and neo Nazis. A decade or two down the line we will may well hear that  Trotsky did not die, but was taken in a flying saucer to a  distant planet, from which he will return to lead us to utopia.
Recollect the New York times on the Ukraine famine.  While  Stalin was torturing peasants to extort their seed corn, the  New York Times denied everything, and was naturaly awarded the Pulitzer prize for their courageous denial of the story.  Since then the former Soviet Union has come to its senses, but the  New York Times remains married to blood and death, insulated  from reality by their own little Berlin wall
Upper crust, more likely, like the New York times -- the kind  of people who could imagine themselves as the planners in a  totalitarian terror state.  The people who tend to imagine  themselves as the planned, rather than the planners, working  class people, are not so keen on terror and slavery.
He certainly has lots of experience writing fiction, but  selective ommission is more his style.  When he tells of the  Olympic sports offices, run by Uday Hussein being looted, you  get the impression of these wicked looters wrecking this  innocent happy sports facility, neglecting to mention that Uday would get his kicks torturing sportsmen and sports women to  death.      --digsig

They are not landowners, at least not as westerners understand owning land  The Sheiks are as hostile to private property rights as commies or Baathists.  In Palestine, when the British tried to register land ownership, the people you describe as landlords engaged in armed resistance.   Hence the Israeli argument that they are not dispossessing Palestinians, it is all state property, on which Palestinians happen to be illegally squatting.
The Israelis intepreted what you are calling landowners as politically controlling people residing on state owned land. The British interpreted them as politically controlling small private landowners.  Much truth in both these interpretations.     --digsig

If that was the plan, the US would do Sudan, not Iraq.
What happened was that when the conscript armies collapsed,
Saddam threw his highly privileged non conscript police forces
into battle, so naturally the US army smashed them.  Poof.  No
police.  No police in a nation of twenty million welfare bums.
Result, loot and burn.
The US army was not expecting this.  Remember Narisaya.  US
army defeated the regular Iraqi army, thought Narisaya done.
Proceeds on its merry way, advancing far past Narisaya.
Police attack, seriously impairing US ability to supply troops
at the front -- people at the front run alarmingly short of

It is really hard to police when you do not speak the language. Furthermore, soldiers are terrible as police.  They tend to  solve all problems by killing the criminals and everyone in the The looting will solve itself soon.  All regime targets have been looted, which means that everyone now has guns.  Naturally the looters start hitting non regime targets.  Those targeted proceed to execute looters.  Looting rapidly declines.

Well indeed they can be, but first catch your rabbit.
Collecting international debts is very difficult at the best of
times, and for frenchies and germans who are owed money by
Saddam, this is not the best of times.
Jaques Random Frenchie had a deal with a French oil company that was weaseling oil through the sanctions, and skimming the oil for food program (which delivered a curiously small amount of food for a startlingly large amount of oil), and his debt was secured by both flows of oil.  But now he discovers that due to the evils of US imperialism, the oil is being pumped by those evil exploitative US companies, who argue that the oil they are pumping has no connection to the oil he has attached.
I kind of visualize Jacques Random Frenchie presenting a writ of attachment to an Iraqi.  The Iraqi attempts to read it.  It is french legalese, which he could not read even if he could read French, which he cannot. Then he turns it upside down to see if he can read it that way. He then hands it to a marine. The marine attempts to read it.   Then the marine turns it upside down to see if he can read it that way.  Then the marine says, "sorry, marines don't do this crap", and attempts to give the writ back, but finds the writ server is not around any more. So he drops the writ on the ground and forgets about it. (Marines make messes, they don't clean them up either.)     --digsig

The mint cannot be anonymous.   Needs reputation, and sizable
wealth. Mint probably employs programmer, or is programmer.
If the code is public domain, then there will be multiple
mints, with some more willing to disregard hostile governments
than others.
I suggest the following introduction:  Introduce for
micropayment services (identity is too expensive for small
payments, which is why credit cards fail below five dollars)
Useful for antispam email charge, remailer user fees, file
sharing networks (solving the free rider problem), pornography
by the minute, and tips for videocam performers.
Need some legal and profitable application to get the software
fully developed, debugged, and people used to it.  When people
are using it for dimes, they will want to start using it for
large sums, and then things get interesting.  Dubai is
currently the banker for people evading third world currency
exchange restrictions.  Once it is working in the micropayment
ghetto, where credit cards are uncompetitive, there will be
demand to break out of that ghetto, and where there is demand,
there will be supply.
Of course there have been many attempts to fill the
micropayment niche, all of them miserable failures.  I think
this is due to the inherantly high costs of identity and
revocability.  If your payments are revocable, then you need
identity, which costs, and you get involved in arbitration,
which costs, and you cannot possibly afford to do that on a
micropayment service.
Child porn and bestiality are, like MP3s, a micropayment
market.  My hard drive keeps getting usenet child porn on it
even though I try to prevent it.  I download what I think is a
Hellsing cartoon, and guess what?   Among the many unviewed
videos and images on my hard drive, there is probably enough
child porn to put me away for fifty consecutive life sentences.
My email spam is full of bestiality, even though I have
numerous filtering rules designed to delete it.  Surprisingly,
I do not think I have seen any snuff spam -- which does not
mean I am not getting it, it may be filtered by my anti porn
spam rules.
Just target file sharing, a legal market, according to the most
recent judicial ruling, and some significant proportion of the
files shared are going to be child porn etc.  That is the users
issue, not the banks.
I disagree.  Micropayments are legal.  Useful if the same
software has legal and illegal uses.   Strong anonymity and
consequent irrevocability has accepted legal, moral, and
economic purpose in the micropayment field.
Mark Twain bank crippled their cash so they could stop
pornographers from using it.
Revocability.  The various digital gold currencies are
compelled to have an AUP and seize the money of people using
their system when this AUP is violated, even though they very
much do not want to, because of the very high costs involved.
No money then crap software, crap software then lack of
critical mass of users.  Has to make money or no one will write
software the ordinary end user will accept.     --digsig

There is a big problem in that "quasi"
Because paypal payments are reversible, Paypal finds itself
very reluctantly in the business of arbitrating disputes, a
potentially expensive and unpopular business which it does very
badly indeed.
The integration with Ebay was intended to reduce this problem,
since ebay does rather well at arbitrating disputes, but
paypal's arbitration is still universally loathed.
If your business model sticks you with performing arbitration,
you find yourself up against the credit card companies, the
eight hundred pound gorilla of arbitration, who do it well, and
more importantly, do it a lot cheaper than you can.

an alternate identity of Dave, and no one can prove that money
paid to Bob actually winds up with Dave.  They can, however
prove they paid Bob.)
If Alice pays Bob in unblinded tokens, this does not help, for
Bob can pass the unblinded tokens to yet another identity of
his, Fred.
One solution is for the bank to maintain an email linked
account for Bob, into which Alice pays.  This sounds ominous,
for the next step might be to link the account to true names,
can anyone see any other problems with it.     --digsig

Presumably Alice prepares a bunch of unblinded tokens, marks them "for Bob" and encrypts them so that only the bank can read Bob then gives that message to the bank, and the bank then tells Bob "yes, its a valid payment for 25 grams of gold to Since Alice knows the secrets embedded in that message, she can prove that she originated that message, so she can prove she paid Bob, but no one else can prove it.  She can prove that to Bob, or to anyone, assuming the bank cooperates.
Of course this means the bank knows how much money everyone is paying Bob, even if it does not know who is paying Bob.
Also Alice cannot prove that the money was accompanied by the message "OK Bob, here is the twenty five grams of gold, deliver the Maltese falcon tonight." and thus cannot prove that Bob, by accepting the tokens valid for the gold, agreed to deliver the Maltese Falcon.
Perhaps these two problems can be fixed.
Alice encrypts a message to the bank containing the unblinded tokens.  It also contains instructions 'accept this deposit only if accompanied by a number whose hash is X, and only if the message is signed with the private key corresponding to this public key 89798759754.
Alice puts this encrypted message to the bank inside a a message to the Bob, which contains the instructions: "OK Bob, here is the twenty five grams of gold, deliver the Maltese falcon tonight.  Here is a cheque made out to cash, for 25 grams of gold, valid if accompanied by the hash of this message, and signed with private key 1764383486*b, where b is whatever your private key is.   Signed Alice."
Bob delivers the cheque, (an encrypted message to the bank) and the bank validates it as correctly formed and containing valid unspent unblinded tokens, and gives him blinded tokens for 25 grams of gold.
To prove that it was Bob who did indeed deposit this money, Alice reveals to the bank the message corresponding to the hash, and thus reveals that 89798759754.= B^1764383486, where B is Bob's public key, and thus, if the bank keeps a record of the exchange, proves that it was Bob who made the exchange, and that the money was from Alice, and was for the Maltese falcon.     --digsig

The change is in you, not them.  Your postings now sound like old fart postings.  A similar transformation is visible in Doonesbury.   I don't know the cure for it.  I don't think it has hit me yet, but I suppose I will be the last to know.  It is probably incurable, like going bald.  It does not strike everyone.  Some, like Feynman, never become old farts, but it strikes a lot of people.
When you were a teenager, everyone thought that Ho Chi Minh was the greatest, had a picture of Che Guevera on their wall, and thought the Soviet Union was going to win.    I would say that the kids of today are a damned lot more libertarian than when you and I were kids.
The cartoonist in "reason" (or perhaps "liberty" not sure which) depicts these protests as being dominated by old farts about your and my age, with the young folk in reluctant tow.

Everyone agrees that big corporations are oppressive,
bureaucratic, inefficient, etc.   No one more so than the
management advisers to big corporations.
Trouble is when you say they are unworthy of liberty, the
implication is let us transfer power to something a great deal
This is the "big tobacco' rhetoric -- a restriction supposedly
on corporations must always necessarily manifest as
restrictions on individual people, and usually, as in the case
of the "big tobacco' rhetoric, it was quite obviously the
intent of those using this rhetoric to impose restrictions on
individual people.  Those using this rhetoric believe they know
better than other people what is good for those other people,
and intend to whack those other people for their own good.

Well, not everyone, but that was surely the way the wind was blowing. The Che Guevera poster symbolizes that era.
In "austin powers", they make the spy sound sixties by depicting him as expecting the victory of the Soviet Union, and perhaps rather favoring that outcome.   If they had him quote Ayn Rand, he would not have sounded sixties.

It has nothing to do with crypto, but a great deal to do with Usually the transfer of value ultimately results in an adjustment in the ledgers of the federal reserve -- the receiving bank goes up slightly, the sending bank goes down slightly, and the traceability follows from the fact that the transaction ultimately goes through the federal reserve.

Firstly, the US army has not violated the Geneva convention: Saddam was eligible for being shot on sight.
Secondly;  It is being overly sensitive about the feelings of those poor fragile souls that hate us and seek to murder us,
that got us into these trouble. Our enemies take it for
weakness, reasonably enough.  We should make it obvious that
nothing will stop us from striking at our enemies, that we will
cheerfully wade knee deep through blood and the body parts of
innocents to destroy those that threaten us, as the crusaders
waded to the holy sepulchre.
As Bin laden said slaughtering the occupants of the twin towers made them look strong:
: :	"when people see a strong horse and a weak horse, by : :	nature, they will like the strong horse. This is : :	only one goal; those who want people to worship the : :	lord of the people, without following that doctrine, : :	will be following the doctrine of Muhammad, peace be : :	upon him"
To the best of my knowledge, the UN only grants those awards to those who inflict quite extraordinary ruin and horrible destruction on their subjects -- such awards are as infamous and perverse as the UN human rights commission, headed by Libya las time I heard.
The UN is a cartel of governments against their subjects.  Just as a cartel of ordinary businesses requires its members to charge high prices and supply low quality, and grants honor and recognition to those members that charge remarkably high prices and unusually low quality, in the same way the UN grants honor and recognition to unusually destructive episodes of looting and pillaging against formerly prosperous law abiding peaceful The UN was established to protect against direct military conflict, but in ordinary day to day life, peaceful competition is a greater threat to the rulers, for example "harmful tax competition".  One of the major goals of the EU is to restrain 'harmful tax competition".  Similarly one of the major goals of the WTO is to prevent what cypherpunks call regulatory arbitrage.     --digsig

Clay Shirky: tells us "The RIAA Succeeds Where the Cypherpunks Failed"
The Government's failure to get the Clipper implemented came at a heady time for advocates of digital privacy -- the NSA was losing control of cryptographic products, Phil Zimmerman had launched his Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) email program, and the Cypherpunks, a merry band of crypto-loving civil libertarians, were on the cover of the second issue of Wired. The floodgates were opening, leading to...
...pretty much nothing. Even after the death of Clipper and the launch of PGP, the Government discovered that for the most part, users didn't want to encrypt their communications. [...]
In response to the RIAA's suits, users who want to share music files are adopting tools like WINW and BadBlue, that allow them to create encrypted spaces where they can share files and converse with one another. [...] Note that the broadening adoption of encryption is not because users have become libertarians, but because they have become criminals; to a first approximation, every PC owner under the age of 35 is now a felon.
And the second effect, of course, is the long-predicted and oft-delayed spread of encryption. The RIAA is succeeding where the Cypherpunks failed, convincing users to trade a broad but penetrable privacy for unbreakable anonymity under their personal control. In contrast to the Cypherpunks "eat your peas" approach, touting encryption as a first-order service users should work to embrace, encryption is now becoming a background feature of collaborative workspaces. Because encryption is becoming something that must run in the background, there is now an incentive to make it's adoption as easy and transparent to the user as possible. It's too early to say how widely casual encryption use will spread, but it isn't too early to see that the shift is both profound and irreversible.     --digsig

You are making up your own history.  When Saddam came to power, he seized western property and murdered westerners, especially Americans, and you lot cheered him to an echo. Saddam was always an enemy of the west, he was never a good guy.  He was at times an ally, in the sense that Stalin and Pol Pot were at times temporary allies, yet somehow I never see you fans of slavery and mass murder criticizing the west for allying with Evil men, by their nature, find themselves in conflict with other evil men for the same reasons as good men do.  Thus evil men and good men will often find themselves in a temporary alliance of convenience against a common enemy, an alliance
that both sides know will end in war or near war fairly soon.
This however seldom leads good men to mistake evil men for
'good guys"     --digsig

Encryption is a defense against threats.  For people to adopt
encryption, they need to be threatened.
All businessmen are guilty of insider trading and destruction of evidence.   In consequence all businessmen use encrypted vpn internally within companies, but not, however, in external communications, rendering a public key infrastructure quite useless.  For widespread tax evasion to take off, we would like widespread use of public keys.
Now the entire population is guilty of file trading.   Pretty soon, therefore, the entire population will be using encryption, but it is far from clear that this encryption will enable all the potential uses of encryption that cypherpunks foresaw.     --digsig

After 9/11 Congress gave the president a blank declaration of

addition, the original declaration of war on Iraq is still in

The blank declaration of war is what the supreme court deemed
to be an unconstitutional delegation of powers back in the
1930s.  Roosevelt responded by threatening to stack the court,
and the court reversed itself.
The blank declaration is supposed to last for the duration of

Saddam will be judged by his victims, who have jurisdiction
enough for me.  Who cares whether the guys at the Hague agree?
Hague claims of jurisdiction have unfailingly led to bad
results, as in the current disastrous trial of Milosevic.
This is the same problem as occurred when the Westphalian state
took over police powers from the local gentry, but in even more
extreme form.
The more distant the police and courts are from the crime, the
criminals, and the victims, the less likely they are to provide
justice, and the slower, more expensive, and less effectual
that justice will be, if justice comes at all, which it
probably will not.
Hague justice does not work.  It is failing with Milosevic. It
would fail with Saddam.  The court at the Hague is apt to
convict the innocent and acquit the guilty in the face of all
evidence, illustrating in more extreme form the problems that
occur with the police powers of the Westphalian state.

No we did not.
in 1958 pro soviet socialists gained ascendency in Iraq, but a
power struggle proceeded between the communist and baathist
wings of the socialist movement.  In 1963, the baathists
launched a coup, intended to be launched simultaneously in all
arab countries, to establish a united supranational arab state
based on the arab race and socialism. The coup succeeded in
Syria, succeeded only temporarily in Iraq. Allegedly this coup
was supported by the CIA, but there is no evidence for this,
nor does it seem very believable that the CIA would wish to see
the arabs united under a pan arab socialist regime.
Shortly thereafter there was a counter coup against the
baathists in iraq, which established a conventional military
regime, whch was eventually overthrown by Baathists in 1967.
If the CIA gave support to either coup, which one do you think
it more likely to support?
The trouble with your account of events is that the baathists
were then as they are today socialist, pan arabist, anti
american and anti colonialist, hence improbable as
beneficiaries of CIA benevolence.
Saddam was no more "our puppet" than Stalin or Pol Pot was, nor
was he ever deemed a good guy, any more than they were.

I am anti war.  You lot are pro Saddam.
Back in the sixties, there were lots of good reasons to oppose
the Vietnam war, notably that it was fought by conscription,
and that McNamara's search for measures of war fighting
efficiency and to create incentives for efficient production of
war effort were demoralizing the troops, and instead of
creating incentives to fight effectively, created perverse
incentives to commit mass murder in place of killing the enemy.
But instead the opponents wound up chanting 'ho, ho, ho Chi
Minh" Ho Chi Minh was a senior KGB agent, who after spending
ten years behind a desk in Moscow organizing the murder of
Indochinese nationalists was sent from Moscow to rule what
became North Vietnam.  He purged 85% of the communist party,
murdering a large but unknown proportion of them, and conducted
a terror against the peasants of extraordinary savagery.
And now the guys on this list are weeping big salt tears about
poor victimized Saddam.
Anyone who opposed the war on Vietnam should have started off
by asking "How shall we contain the Soviet Union and eventually
defeat communism, and what is wrong with the way this
administration is doing it.
Similarly anyone who opposes the war in Iraq should start by
visualizing himself as the heir of  King John Sobieski, not the
heir of Saladin.  Anyone opposing the war in Iraq needs oppose
it from the point of view that Americans and their way of life
should win, deserve to win, and the raghead fanatics should
lose, and their way of life perish.
Anyone who wants to argue that the guys in the two towers had
it coming, and poor Saddam is a victim, puts himself in the

one does not need to check the facts of that particular case. That poor little Saddam was victimized is an obviously stupid
argument, and anyone making it an obviously evil person.

If you call for the release of Saddam, or you justify 9/11, as the "anti-war" posters in this thread have  been arguing, then indeed you are with the terrorists.
You are stupid evil, and a loser.
A popular anti-colonial nationalist movement which he led from Moscow?   Somehow I seriously doubt that Stalin's Moscow was the place to find nationalist movements, let alone popular When Ho came to power in North Vietnam, he treated the population as though they were the enemy, and himself the quisling leader of a hostile alien occupation force.  In his terror against the Vietnamese, he set execution quotas.  His servants had to kill such and such a number of "class enemies" in each village.
I deleted most of your lies without comment, as too obvious and stupid to merit rebuttal, but this lie, though equally obvious and equally stupid, is significant, as it links the fans of Saddam, with the fans of Stalin and Soviet expansionism.
You accuse the US of not merely being allied to bin Laden, but of "creating" him, which presupposes that the US created the Afghan resistance, and indeed every resistance to Soviet Hey, if it had not been for that nasty CIA the afghans would have been happy as pigs in mud enjoying the vast benefits of being uplifted by the Soviets to the superior level of civilization enjoyed by the beneficiaries of Soviet alliance
That is a lie we have heard over and over again, with thirty different wars of Soviet aggression, starting in the 1920s.  We heard it most infamously uttered against East German resistance, and every time we heard that tired old lie, those servants of tyranny uttering it were less believable, and less oh come on.
The Baathist coup was part of a pan arab conspiracy for simultaneous coups in all major arab countries, to create a united pan arab socialist government modelled on Stalin's dictatorship, which would supposedly make the arabs strong in the way that Stalin had supposedly made the Soviet Union It is plausible that the CIA might support an ordinary military coup against a pro Soviet tyrant, but it is unbelievable that the CIA would support a pan arabist coup, intended to unite the arab world and subjugate the drunken fat princes of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, etc.
Plus, if you really believed that Saddam was a CIA agent, how
come you are calling for him to be released, or turned over to
the questionable justice of his fellow tyrants and mass
murderers running the court in the Hague?     --digsig

The US army would be wholly in compliance with international law even if it nailed Saddam's head to a post in central Baghdad with a nine inch nail.  Saddam is not entitled to POW protections.  He was running the war effort out of uniform and hidden amongst civilians, which has always been a shoot-on-the-spot violation of the rules of war, and his war effort consisted largely of terrorist attacks directed at civilians, which regrettably has not been a shoot-on-the-spot violation, but arguably should be.

It was an unwise war fought by unjust means.  The cause of saving the Vietnamese from Soviet domination was a just cause, as the terror and the flood of refugees that followed the defeat of the west in Indochina proved.   However, "just cause" is only one of the several criteria needed for a just war.
(And the Iraqi war does not satisfy all the criteria of just
war either, though hanging Saddam is surely a just cause.)

So in your version of reality, the Iraqi people were happily enjoying socialism, loving the socialism this benevolent Kassem provided to them and then this evil capitalistic CIA agent, Saddam, took it all away from them.
If that is what happened, what is your objection then to him being given to Iraqi people for execution?  Why are you calling for him to be released, or to be given to his fellow tyrants
who run the Hague court, who certainly will not execute him,
probably will not imprison him for very long, and might well
exonerate him?      --digsig

Those who want Saddam released, for the most part also rationalize 9/11
He may not be related to the terrorists, but his fans are related to the terrorists.
The title of this thread is "I am anti war, you stupid evil scum are pro saddam."
I do not support the invasion.   I am not making up pretenses for the invasion.
This is war.  Rule of law does not apply.  Rules of war do apply.  And rules of war say that the US army can not only give Saddam a dental examination, it can nail Saddam's head to a post in Baghdad with a nine inch nail, because he was captured out of uniform, administering the war effort while hiding amongst civilians.
Handing him to the ICC is not fine, because the ICC is not going to execute him, and because the ICC is farcically incompetent, and because the ICC is dominated by the same tyrants who dominate the UN human rights commission, who might well choose to let him off.
When I see how many people want to get him off, I more and more think the the USG needs to kill him quickly.  The longer he lives, the greater the likelyhood that his international pals will pull him out of trouble, and eventually return him to The Nuremberg trials were held in Germany by the victors.  Why this big desire to do something different this time around?   I don't hear anyone except the usual Nazis whining that Nuremberg was illegitimate or unfair.     --digsig

True, but amongst the vast mass chanting Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh,  one could no more discern principled opponents of the Vietnam  war, than one can today discern principled opponents of the  Iraqi war among the Americans worrying about poor little  victimized Saddam, and the mass of Europeans jumping for joy  over the fall of the two towers.
Amidst the pro Saddam posters on this thread, many have come  rather close to chanting "Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh" -- for the  example the argument that the evil CIA deprived the third world masses of their beloved socialism provided by benevolent  dictators, and the argument that the US "created' the Afghan  resistance -- and thus presumably every other resistance  movement against the Soviets.
Now I get to call you the pinko:
They were supposedly supporters of the NLF, which they well  knew was a North Vietnamese sock puppet, and thus a KGB sock  puppet.  And when that sock puppet was discarded to reveal the iron fist of the NVA that had been moving its lips, none of  them were surprised or dismayed.   Similarly Jane Fonda was supposedly not a supporter of the North Vietnamese qua North Vietnamese, yet without hesitation she lied about the condition and treatment of the POWs she met, whom she depicted as leniently treated war criminals.  When some of those she lied about returned home to speak the truth, she stuck to her position, counter attacking them as hypocrites and liars, denying that they had shown signs of starvation and torture.
I find it strange that the speakers at your rally were so  remarkably different from the speakers at my rally --  particularly when so many of the pro Saddam posters in this  thread sound like they are new nyms for the same people who  spoke at my rally.
If any of your speakers really thought the NLF was something  other than a KGB sock puppet, they would have had posters of  the supposed NLF leader on their wall.  Instead, not one of  these supposed supporters of the NLF blinked when the most of  the NLF vanished in the 1975 purge.

Not a straw man.  Those who think poor little Saddam was a victim, for the most part also think that the US 'created" the afghan resistance, and, particularly if they were European, think the that Americans had 9/11 coming to them.
Saddam was not behind the 9/11 attack, but he was and is allied with those that were, and, the point of my argument, western socialists allied with him and them.  Bin Laden, in obviously violation of the Koran which mandates capitalism, has taken socialism on board, Saddam, originally a secularist, has taken Sunni Islamicism on board, bridging what small ideological gap there was between him and Bin Laden, and western socialists are alarmingly willing to overlook the arabism and islamicism of the few remaining socialists in power.
During the invasion of Iraq, most of the arab news feeds, or at least their corresponding english language websites, were reasonably fair and balanced, while the BBC went over the top with Saddamite propaganda.  When I read the Al Jazeera web site, most of the entirely over the top propaganda came from western correspondents.  Al Jazeera's own correspondants were for the most part OK.
The western intellectuals are not reacting to this as a war of caucasians vs semites, but a war of ideologies -- German originated ideology vs English originated ideologies, with Saddam and Bin Laden incarnating Heidegger and Bush incarnating Locke.   Very likely Saddam had nothing to do with causing 9/11, but Chomsky and the BBC did have something to do with causing 9/11.
When one sees someone arguing that Americans had 9/11 coming,
he frequently starts quoting improbable "facts" that originate from Chomsky, and backs them up with one of the nuttier BBC correspondents.     --digsig

Your story is inconsistent.  You tell us Saddam was a
capitalistic CIA agent -- so therefore we should not let the
Iraqis hang him. Huh?
Saddam also was and is socialist, anti western, anti american,
seized stuff without compensation etc, which is presumably why
you are backing him today -- and which makes the tale that he
was a CIA "creation" unbelievable.
Your "history" comes for the most part from notorious KGB
agents, for example John Pilger.
usually conspicuously fail to confirm these tales -- these
tales all being variants of one single tale -- that wherever
Soviet aligned tyrants had trouble with each other or with
those they subjugated, it was all the CIA's doing.
Consider the trial of Milosevic.  Either the Hague is
deliberately trying to get him off, or they are idiots.  Most
likely idiots.
Plus if the Hague should ever get to exercise real power,
which its present performance makes unlikely, we would have a
world government, which would probably decide the entire
American population to be war criminals and send everyone to
the camps.     --digsig

Oh come on.
A whole platoon of random troops would have to be part of a big conspiracy. Plus quite a few Iraqis have interviewed him.  They in the vast right wing conspiracy also?
Or did the US perhaps rewrite Saddam's memory with the memory erasure thingy from 'men in black'
Shortly after busting Saddam, the US busted large numbers  of people in his apparatus, on the basis of records seized from his farmhouse.  Did Saddam's henchmen perhaps not notice Saddam was missing because the US replaced him with a double?
Real conspiracies exist, but when you start to see conspiracies so large, so well organized, so tightly disciplined, embracing so many quite ordinary seeming people, you are slipping into madness.   If a conspiracy is large, it is not going to be well organized and tightly disciplined.   The communists took the big conspiracy as far as it could go, and it did not go that far.  It is really hard to put on a big show unless you can carefully select your audience for willing suspension of If the US was faking the circumstances of Saddam's capture, this would be comparable to the bigger potemkin village operations that the communists put on, for example Mao's fake prison, where only the most privileged got to play prisoner, but the communists were utterly paranoid about exercising total control of any outsider's access to the set, the actors or anyone remotely connected to the actors, and only allowed the most carefully selected outsiders tightly controlled and highly
supervised access, whereas the US army has been completely
relaxed about letting anyone contact those involved in the
story.     --digsig

It is mighty hard to take guns from anybody but Stalin when you
are working in Moscow 9 to 5 for Stalin.
He worked behind a desk in Moscow for over ten years in a very
senior position, which suggests he joined the KGB as a field
agent much earlier.
Kind of odd behavior for a nationalist.
If you are looking for a nationalist leadership, Stalin's
Moscow was not the place to find it.
Containment was a catastrophe from the beginning.  The US
government should have done what the communists accused us of
doing, and provided aid to the resistance in East Germany
shortly after Stalin launched the cold war, and aid for the
anti communist resistance in China when the true nature of
Chinese 'land reform" became apparent.
Containment is a strategy that requires one to win or draw
every time, at places and times of the enemies choosing.  The
US army did not win every time, and Vietnam was a bad place and
With roll back, one could lose some, lose most, or even lose
all, and if one launched more wars than the Soviet Union could
afford, would still win the overall struggle.   Indeed,
arguably this was what happened during the second Reagan term.

Considerably less than three thousand.  And "we" did not kill them.  The Israelis did.  There are lots of states worse than Israel -- Iraq for one.
In particular, the people in the two towers did not kill them.
If Palestinians had bombed the white house or congress, that might well have been just.  But Bin Laden's boys were children
of wealth, power, and privilege.  Even if they had been bombing Washington, they did not have just cause.  And they were not bombing Washington, they were bombing the two towers.
The 9/11 terrrorists were not Palestinians.  They were not avenging Israeli dispossession of Palestinians, and had they been, they would have been hitting the wrong target.     --digsig

You were already in a frenzy of rage before I accused you of weeping big salt tears for poor little victimized Saddam.
My position on the Vietnam and Iraq wars is the same as that as the mainstream left of the Democratic party (or at least the same as the position they will be holding once the primaries are over), yet you reacted as if I had called for everyone like you to be gassed.
The position you purport to hold is almost indistinguishable from my own and that of the Democrat party mainstream -- but that is not the position implied by your arguments, nor does it correspond to the emotions you express.   Sometimes the position nominally taken by leading Democrats fail to correspond to the arguments and emotions they express also -- Dean has caught some flack for that -- but the discrepancy in your case has is far more visible than that of Dean,    You will not catch Dean weeping big salt tears for Saddam, nor see him deeply shocked by the prospect that Saddam will be tried by his victims. and Dean has a legitimate excuse for his
comparativelyt mild hypocrisy -- he is upset about the the
impact of the coming execution of Saddam on his election
campaign, not about the impact on the prospects for a world of
slavery and fear.     --digsig

ruler has no property right in his subjects or his rule.

Saddam murdered huge numbers of civilians, we are still digging up the mass graves.
Solution:  Give him to his victims, who certainly have jurisdiction. They charge him with mass murder.

You are real close right now.
You just issued the "sovereignty" rationalization for Saddam's
crimes, and your peculiar recollection of the speakers at those
Vietnam war demonstrations sounds like a marxist's
recollection, and of course theire are your regular call for
various groups to be sent up the chimney's, which presupposes
some benevolent vanguard group wise enough and virtuous enough
to identify which individuals belong to these undesirable
categories and need to go up the chimneys.

The technology is known, it has become depressingly apparent that imminent world change by means of this technology is not in the cards right now, what is left to say?
The cypherpunk agenda is in fact making progress in boring routine ways -- increasing real world use of encryption, various complicated boring routine measures to improve security.  Digital currencies have plateaued by some measures, but I think uptake will continue.   At present, digital currencies do not give you any privacy from the currency issuer, but in practice monitoring is expensive, and low monitoring issuers tend to out compete high monitoring issuers. No issues of Chaumian cash have succeeded, but Chaumian cash is the ultimate in low monitored, irreversible transactions, so as Hettinga is fond of arguing, the trend is in its favor, but immediate change is not in sight.
With americans, and the english speaking west in general under attack, the tendency is to rally around the state.    Anarchism is not as popular as it was, not as cools as it was, when enemies are trying to kill us, and the state is trying to kill our enemies.
It is war.
You are suffering from old fogyism.  "Ah, teenagers today are so rotten and selfish, not like we were."  This reminds me of the indignant complaints about the fact that at the recent woodstock, so many young women were naked and semi conscious on Do you remember the original woodstock?
If you do remember, you were not there.
You think the "reefer madness" hysteria was laughable?  They recently gave some poor sucker a sentence of several hundred years for "raping" girls by giving GHB, although his home movies seem to show the alleged rape victims enthusiastically jumping him.
The fact is that our generation turned into the generation we were revolting against, only ten times worse.   That is what went wrong.  Four times the hypocrisy, ten times the jail sentences.  It started when those boring puritan Leninists took over SDS (Students for a democratic society) in 1963, 1964. All
that terribly solemn do gooding in the 1962 Port Huron statement, and the next thing you know instead of "Sex drugs and rock and roll", we hear that heterosexuality constitutes sexism and Andrew Luster is being abducted from a foreign country as if he was general Noriega.   If he had jumped out of the bushes, sawed a nine year old's arms and legs off, and then raped her, the government would not have had him kidnapped in order to get him.
Teenagers have not changed, instead we have become those old fogies we revolted against.  We did not realize that the port
Huron statement turned us into young fogies, the doddering
senile washed up old bolsheviks.     --digsig

This is the usual Marxist shit that living standards fell as a result of the industrial revolution, and have been falling ever If it is getting harder to own a home, why is the proportion of people who own their own homes growing steadily, and been growing steadily (with some brief, minor, and infrequent dips) for as long as anyone has been keeping records?  Why are the homes steadily getting bigger, while the number of inhabitants in the home get steadily smaller?
You guys have been making up this data ever since Marx rewrote Gladstone's budget speech, to have Gladstone declare that "this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power ... is an augmentation entirely confined to classes of property."
When in fact Gladstone said the direct opposite, and proved it with statistics, proved that the poor had experienced, as a result of the industrial revolution "this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power"
This is the same moron marxism as expressed in the word "sweatshop": To a naive and ignorant socialist it seems that if each man selfishly pursues his own desire, the result will necessarily be chaos and hardship, that one person's plan will naturally harm those that are not part of it, hence such phrases and concepts as "sweatshop" which presuppose that one man producing a plan to create value and another man providing equipment to implement that plan, has somehow magically made the workers in a poor country worse off, that saving, investment and entrepeneurship is unproductive, that investment, particularly investment by rich people creating the means of production in poor countries, is a plot to swindle the poor, a scam, a transfer from poor to rich.     --digsig

By "developed" I mean when orchards became housing.
That, Tim, is my point.   Think about it.
If you look at the statistics for any one area, it becomes
harder and harder to afford.
However, if you look at the statistics for America as a whole,
it becomes easier and easier to afford, as manifested by the
ever increasing proportion of people that own their own houses.
This is a consequence of the fact that in any one area, you run
out of legally available land for houses, but for America as a

I never figured out how to use a certificate to authenticate a
client to a web server, how to make a web form available to one
client and not another.  Where do I start?
What I and everyone else does is use a shared secret, a
password stored on the server, whereby the otherwise anonymous
client gets authenticated, then gets an ephemeral cookie
identifying him..   I cannot seem to find any how-tos or
examples for anything better, whether for IIS or apache.
As a result we each have a large number of shared secret
passwords, whereby we each log into a large number of
webservers.  Was this what the people who created this protocol

References: <4.2.2.20030604094322.00d5ed90
    --
Over the past ten years there have been many attempts to get a micropayment system working, all of which have failed dismally, leading to a widespread attitude that internet micropayments just do not work, and never will work.
In the past 24 hours, e-gold has done fifty thousand micropayments, of which thirty thousand were one milligram of gold or under (about one cent or under)   These are non anonymous, in that e-gold can link payer to payee, but anonymous in that it laborious to link e-gold account numbers to true names.
e-gold has no knowledge what they are being used for.  If they gathered that much information, it probably would not be worthwhile for their customers, but I would guess these are mostly per-click-through payments for ads. Some proportion of these payments must be e-gold's own referral scheme, but the majority have to be other people's schemes, perhaps other people's similar schemes.
The fact that e-gold does not know what is going on suggests that past attempts to support micropayments failed by putting too great a burden on those seeking to participate.     --digsig

I don't think so.
Suppose the e-gold, to prevent this sea of spam trying to get
people to login to fake e-gold sites, wanted people to use
public keys instead of shared secrets, making your secret key
the instrument that controls the account instead of your shared
They could not do this using the standard IE webbrowser.  They
would have to get users to download a custom client, or at
least, like hushmail, a custom control inside IE.
HTTPS assumes that the certificate shall be blessed by the
administrator out of band, and has no mechanism for using a
private key to establish that a user is simply the same user as
last time.     --digsig

It is a hard problem with many well known solutions, none of
which have to my knowledge been implemented in HTTPS.  For
example one can use SPEKE, in which case setting up the account
involves sharing (or issuing) a password, but logging in to the
account does not require one to reveal the password to the site
where one is logging in.   In this case the fake website would
gain no useful information by luring the user to login to it.
The most HTTPS like solution would be to generate a keyfile
containing a self signed private key on one's computer, and
whenever one hit the website, it would do the HTTPS handshake
to log you in to that website's account for the public key
corresponding to your private key, however HTTPS does not seem
to directly support this model.   In this case the bogus web
site could log you in, but this would not leak any information
that would enable the operators of the bogus web site to login
to the real web site.     --digsig

James A. Donald:
That is a solution to a completely different problem.  Using that method the administrator would have to set up each client, which is impractically expensive and inconvenient unless administrator and customer meet personally and their computers are in the same office.
The point is that the customer should be able to set himself up, as he does on e-gold, hotmail, hushmail, etc, and that if subsequently he is fooled into logging on to a fake site this should do no harm.
James A. Donald:
You cannot use https to implement the trust model that hotmail and everyone else uses.  In that sense it does say something about the trust model.  It assumes they are subject to hierarchical validation, which e-gold passwords and hotmail passwords are not.
hotmail passwords merely show it is the same guy logging in. You cannot use https to do this.  It is designed to show it is the guy blessed by the administrator logging in.
Because that is not the trust model they or hotmail want to implement.   They don't want true names, and they do not want, and cannot afford, the very great overheads associated with true names.
To implement the desired trust model, the client browser would need to generate the private key during account creation. E-gold would then record the corresponding public key.   You cannot do that with existing client software.
They do not want to turn their business model upside down to support verisign's profit model.   The problem is to implement
the existing model in a way that protects against the man in
the middle attack represented by this storm of fake sites.     --digsig

Precisely.  I am talking about direct substitution that should

as passwords are used, except that the fake site trick fails.

This sounds more like what I was looking for.
Probably someone has already pointed out the url to this, but if they did, I when I looked at it I was snowed under by verisign oriented shit, which assumes a large budget and ample administrator time for face to face contact with certified people, a very small number of clients, some hours of work by
each client, a manual, user training, etc, and failed to grasp
Could you point me somewhere that illustates server issued certs, certification with zero administrator overhead and small end user overhead?
Also, I have many times heard that public key operations were surprisingly easy, and have been key administrator for several companies, and have unfailingly found that I was the only person capable of doing these operations at that company.     --digsig

https is like a strong fortress wall that only goes half way
around the fortress.
The most expensive and inconvenient part of https, getting
certificates from verisign, is fairly useless.
The useful part of https is that it has stopped password
sniffing from networks, but the PKI part, where the server, but
not the client, is supposedly authenticated, does not do much

I do not think so:  Observe CNN whitewashing Saddam.  Observe NBC imagining "unexpectedly strong Iraqi resistance", predicting that the battle of Baghdad would resemble the siege of Stalingrad, and observe its conspicuous failure to notice that the US was winning decisively in the cities.  If you watched NBC, then when the statue fell, you would say "Hey, what happened!!"

pinkos that dominate the news media.

This is a melange of infamous claims issued by the New York

The press is not biased when it fails to report an issue as
much as you would desire.  The press is biased when their
political desires get in the way of reality, as in their
reporting of "unexpectedly strong Iraqi resistance" and the
inability of large sections of the press to notice that the
Iraqis were losing in the cities, as well as the desert.
On MSNBC there were a huge number of stories predicting a
Stalingrad like battle for Baghdad, and then when the US
started taking cities with very low casualties, a viewer of NBC
would have had great difficulty in discovering the fact.  NBC
did not fail to give some stories the emphasis that some people
thought they should have. Instead their stories were wrong.     --digsig

that recently existent communism is not so bad, also post that

Against the Soviet Union in its prime, or against the Nazi
commie alliance, an anarcho capitalist america would have been
in deep trouble, if it had the same level of technology as the
actually existent america had back then.
Against current enemies, not a problem.  Observe the big role
and great effectiveness of "special forces" (small numbers of
high quality espionage style forces).   An anarcho capitalist
america, while it would have trouble fielding big armies, would
probably do special forces operations considerably better than
big government bureacracies do.
Current enemies are not much, because americans have a
technological lead.  Americans have a technological lead
because america is the close to the most capitalist country in
the world, and it is the most capitalist large country.  An
anarcho capitalist America would in time have an even greater
technological lead.

Despite the fact that the trend has been in the other direction
for the past two hundred years, despite the fact that what Marx

That is of course a rhetorical question, but it has a
straightforward answer
I was in the movement during the late sixties and early
seventies and watched the authoritarianism become visible the
seventies, and eventually realized it had always been present,
but hidden by the war against conscription.
Initially, the movement started off against racist Jim Crow
laws, issues where leftism and libertarianism, and Marxism were
all on the same side.  So naturally the Marxists called
themselves lovers of liberty, and no doubt believed themselves.
With Jim Crow laws out of the way, but the draft not yet the
big issue, Marxism took the reins, and it has held those reigns
ever since, though since the fall of the Soviet Union nazism
has started to share authority.  When the draft ended, the
movement took up issues such as enslaving the third world and
political correctness.   It became visible as the enemy of
freedom and human life the seventies, when so many third
worlders were enslaved or murdered, but not many cared, because
the goal were far away. Since then, issues like the anti sex
laws in the workplace, expanding the war on some drugs to
include tobacco, and support for the 9//11 terrorists and
Saddam has caused increasing numbers of ordinary people to care
about these evil people.
When the Jim Crow laws were out of the way, but the war in
Vietnam had not yet begun to bite, caring and activist youths
cast about for new issues, and adopted "social justice",  Of
course "social justice", being a form of cosmic justice,
implies a vast authoritarian state to do good to people with
baton and gun whether the beneficiaries like it or not, so to
counterbalance that they adopted a criticism of existing state
institutions as unresponsive to the will of the people, and a
program of "participatory democracy" to make those institutions
responsive to the will of the people.
Of course the program of "social justice", and helping the poor
and oppressed brought out the Marxist in all of us.
Subconsciously we visualized ourselves holding the whips and
guns and beating in the faces of those bloody ungrateful poor
and oppressed until they showed us the gratitude we deserved. I observed this in myself and others in the late sixties, and
reading of earlier movement activities, I can see it the
writers, though they could not see this in the themselves.   As
Pinochet is alleged to have said, but did not, everyone is a
Marxist, but only some know it.
The actual poor and oppressed in the west sensed the
condescension, hatred, and intended violence, and rejected the
do gooders of the movement as long haired creeps, recognizing
them as the class enemies that they were.  Embittered by this
rejection, the movement turned its benevolence on those too
tightly controlled to fight back, the third worlders, and came
to identify emotionally with governments such as Castro's which
swiftly tortured anyone who was insufficiently grateful for all
the good that had been done to him with electric shocks.
So emotionally the activists were already no longer the anti
authoritarians they thought they were, but there was as yet no
contradiction between the movement's belief in itself as anti
authoritarian, and what it was actually doing.
The movement set about implementing participatory democracy
within itself.  Participatory democracy in actual practice has
a striking resemblance to Lenin's democratic centralism.  To
the extent that it actually is participatory, he with the
strongest bladder wins, but what usually happens is not
"participation" (rule by those with iron bladders and
incredible tolerance for boredom), but instead Leninist
democratic centralism, rule by a secretive and conspiratorial
organized minority.  We called ourselves "the caucus", but the
caucus was, in practice, "the party".  The movement rapidly
came to be controlled by people who thought of the themselves
as secret communists or open communists, a small conspiracy,
hostile to the existing order, aimed at taking power, acting
under a mask in a hostile world, which we expected to become
violently repressive as it entered the throws of the expected
world revolution..  Among us were many people who thought of
themselves as secret agents for an outside power, some of whom
may perhaps have accepted some small change from those who
actually were agents of that power, many of whom accepted
substantial non money benefits from China, Russia, or one of
Russia's puppet regimes.
At that point, the point where I became part of the movement,
and part of the caucus, the movement was fundamentally
authoritarian, but we believed ourselves to be libertarian, and
what we were doing did not obviously contradict that belief.
With the end of conscription however, the authoritarian mindset
of the movement became increasingly visible.  This was most
spectacularly revealed with the fall of Vietnam and Cambodia,
when the movement came out in defence of tyranny, slavery, and
mass murder, glibly forgetting the liquidation of those such as
the NLF that they had claimed to identify with.     --digsig

 Assuming that a CPU
costs $500 and that its value can be amortized over 2 years,
CPU costs .0016 cents/second.
To say the same thing in different words, the spammer's
unattended computer costs 0.0016cents per second, the non
spammer's computer is worth about 0.5cents per second, because
there is an impatient user sitting there waiting for the mail
to complete.
Thus the non spammer's computer time costs approximately four

Lower case letters represent integers, capital letters elliptic
curve points.
Let k be the banks secret key.
The bank promises to pay a specific sum of money for any secret
of the form ( x, P), such that P = k * H(x) where H is a hash
function mapping random integers onto points on an elliptic
curve and k is a secret known only to the token issuer
Bob has an existing old used token of this form, and therefore
knows that V= k * U even though he does not know k.
Bob invents the random numbers t and q, constructs an elliptic
point R = t *U + Hash( q ) and pays the bank to construct T= k

 I want fully deniable information storage -- information  theoretic deniable, not merely steganographic deniable, for  stenography can never be wholly secure.
So I would have a fixed sized block of data containing a variable number of smaller secret chunks of data.  A random key would extract a random length of gibberish, a valid key would extract a stream of valid data, and revealing one secret key to the adversary would not give the adversary any evidene that more secrety keys were present or absent.
Any good known algorithms for this?     --digsig

I want to store information deniably.
So there would be a fixed sized block of data, say one megabyte, increasing by multiples of 8 as needed.
This would contain various items of information that one could extract by supplyin a secret, symmetric, key.   A random key would extract a block of gibberish of random length   There would be no indication as to how many bits of meaningful data were stored in the block, though obviously they would have to add up to less than the size of the block.
So one could store one's password list under one key, and the location of the dead bodies under another key, and absent that key, there would be no evidence that they key, or information hidden under that key, existed.
What is a good algorithm for this?

When a mailing list is full of crap, it dies, even though the  regulars set killfiles to silence the offending posters.  The  reason is, no new people arrive.
New people subscribe, see nothing but crap, unsubscribe.
A mailing list or newsgroup needs a strong personality who is a prolific poster who keeps discussions on track, issues lots of good stuff, and reprimands trolls and nuts.  That person, of   course was Tim May.  (past tense)
It also needs a continual stream of new people, who bring new  ideas, and unfamiliar ways of recognizing old ideas.
The relentless mass spamming by professor rat and Jim Choate   keeps new comers away, since 99% of the posts to the list is   from people who hate the ideas that the list was created to    further, and seek to shut it down, to prevent thought about and discussion of such ideas, and Tim May has succumbed to terminal grumps on discovering that the crypto transcendence is not    coming soon.
So when is the crypto trancendence coming?  When does an    encryption enabled internet start to undermine the power of the Well it is a little like web groceries.  During the Dot.com    hype, lots of web grocery companies popped up, and made about a cent on the dollar.  They vanished, but, surprise surprise,    there are now some real web grocery firms,  and they are    making a little bit of money.
Darknet (frost over freenet) is going tolerably well, mostly in its Japanese incarnation, the repression being stronger in    Japan.  The Japanese experience tells us that any repression   short of communist levels of repression will make darknet    stronger, not weaker.  The big threat to frost over freenet is the natifying of the net which makes more and more people into clients, not peers.   Theoretically frost over freenet serves   even those behind NATs, but really it does not, and cannot.
Private money on the internet remains a small, non anonymous,  There is no Chaumian anonymity.  There is some "trust us"    anonymity, located on offshore islands, controlled by people   quite susceptible to US pressure.
Account based money without true names or the mark of the beast is a tiny but profitable business.  E-gold is probably the    largest player, with about two million dollars a day changing  hands, and twenty thousand micropayments a day (payments of    less than a dollar)
Two million a day is one five hundred thousandth of the     turnover on the US$, and it is not growing very fast.  Of    course e-gold is just one of several, but it probably a large  portion of the total.
Suppose no-true-name account based money grows at thirty    percent a year, which seems plausible.	In due course    some substantial portion of it will be chaumian.
Then the US$ goes into crisis in 2060. As Adam Smith put it,   "There is a lot of ruin in a nation.".
Even if we suppose that the institutions of the crypto    trancendence undergo remarkably rapid growth, the kind of    growth that the dot bombs predicted in their business plans,   the crypto trancendence does not hit until around 2025.
But right now today, the internet is undermining the power of  the state.  The Japanese government went as far as democracy   can go, and perhaps a bit further, to shut down file sharing.  The result:  Widespread adoption of software based on freenet. Cypherpunks 1, state 0.  We have a long way to go, but we are  Oh yeah, and once again I declare the mailing list that gave  the name of this movement to be dead, though the fact that I am still posting on it would seem to prove it is alive, though
breathing its last.

SSH server public/private keys are widely deployed.  PKI public keys are not.  Reason is that each SSH server just whips up its own keys without asking anyone's permission, or getting any Outlook and outlook express support digital signing and  encryption -- but one must first get a certificate.
So I go to Thawte to get my free certificate, and find that  Thawte is making an alarmingly great effort to link  certificates with true name information, and with the beast  number that your government has assigned to you, which imposes large costs both on Thawte, and on the person seeking the  certificate, and also has the highly undesirable effect that  using these certificates causes major loss of privacy, by  enabling true name and beast number contact tracing of people  using encryption.
Now what I want is a certificate that merely asserts that the  holder of the certificate can receive email at such and such an address, and that only one such certificate has been issued for that address.  Such a certification system has very low costs  for issuer and recipient, and because it is a nym certificate, no loss of privacy.
Is there any web page set up to automatically issue such  The certs that IE and outlook express accept oddly do not seem to have any provision for defining what the certificate  This seems a curious and drastic omission from a certificate  Since there is no provision to define what a certificate  certifies, one could argue that any certification authority  that certifies anything other than a true name connected to a  state issued id number, the number of the beast, is guilty of  fraud.  This would seem to disturbingly limit the usefulness  and application of such certificates.  It also, as anyone who  tries to get a free certificate from Thawte will discover,  makes it difficult, expensive, and inconvenient to get  certificates.      --digsig

Not it is not.
For this to happen, the attacker must solicit the the victim to log on to a site he has never logged onto before, or redirect him to logon to a site he has never logged onto before.  In this situation, the SSH uncertified public keys work far better than Verisign's certified keys -- for example the spam email urging us to log on to "e-golb.com" or "e-go1d.com" would fail if https used ssh style public keys, because the user would get a "new site" dialog, tipping him off that something was up, and that he should check what is going on.
Thus under this attack, ssh uncertified keys work far better than https certified keys.
Far safer to do that than to rely on https certified keys, as lots of people discovered who logged into "e-go1d.com" or The victim never expects the server to have a new key, and in the unlikely event he did expect it the out of band mechanism notifying him of the new key is under the sites control, not the attackers.

Ideally a client that mediates interactions should get trust
information from all relevant sources, and flag the user when
there is something unusual about an interaction.
However the more sources, the harder it is for mere software to
figure out what is meaningful and relevant, and therefore the
greater the risk that one will wind up continually throwing
irrelevant dialog boxes at the user, which the user eventually
learns to click through and ignore.

For a long time the US has been the center of the world
monetary system, and the US dollar the base money of which all
others are derivatives.
The primary way of doing transactions on the internet is by
credit card, with the headquarters and computers located in the
USA.  The secondary way is by paypal, located in the USA.
Paypal and credit card requires information that ultimately
links to your true name and social security number, and people
in those peripheral and backward countries that do not yet have
their system of government issued identity well integrated to
that of the USA, for example Poland, cannot use Paypal.
The US government makes a big profit out of this, effectively
gaining an interest free loan on each dollar it prints, and it
also leverages it into a source of power.  Those it disapproves
of are cut off from the mainstream money system.
Now if one cuts a few terrorists off from the money system, no
problem, but when one cuts off large numbers of terrorists,
suspected terrorists, suspected child pornographers, suspected
money launderers, suspected tax dodgers,  and the entire
population of Poland, who is being cut off?  The terrorists or
the US?
Well people, I think the money system has just turned upside
down.  The money launderers are not being cut off from the US
led international monetary system.  Instead the US is being cut
off from the money launderer led international monetary system.
The two most popular no-true-name accounts are e-gold an
I googled for web pages containing both the word "egold" and
the word "moneybookers".  Got lots of hits, seems that lots of
quite ordinary people are finding it cheaper or more convenient
to mediate international transactions through computers that
are not located in the US and whose accounts are not coupled to
true names.
The great majority of people and money are still going through
the US led system, and since people are reluctant to change,
that will continue for a long time.  But they no longer have
to, and for most people in the world, there is no longer a good
reason why they should.
A no-true-name account is inherently cheaper than a true-name
account, because of the high cost of managing true names.  The
early adopters seem to be largely people who are sensitive to
the cost of setting up accounts.
However, a no-true-name account still faces the problem that it
is reversible, dragging the issuer into the arbitration
business, which most issuers are not competent to do.   All
users have to pay a transaction cost reflecting arbitration
costs, whether they want their transactions to be arbitrable or
not.  The solution to that cost, is chaumian money.  The fact
that no-true-name money seems to be beating true-name money
leads me hope that economics can beat inertia and regulation.     --digsig

With modern CPUs one needs a great deal of care installing the heat sink to avoid overheating.   A standard CPU fan is not equivalent to a competently built computer.
A modern bios has the capability to switch the computer off if it detects overheating.  Unfortunately this capability is often off by default, or is deliberately switched off by shoddy assemblers who do not care whether they have installed functional CPU cooling -- and they usually have not.
I recently built a computer for my son.  Went through two CPU cooling systems before I got satisfactory cooling with the third system   Then after the a few months the rather small and fragile plastic motherboard clip that held the extremely massive cooling system against the CPU cracked, impairing cooling efficiency, and I had to take the system apart and McGyver a clip out of inductor wire.  Since it has worked fine. Modern cpu cooling systems are so massive that we need metal to metal clips all the way through the mother board, but today's motherboards still come with these frail little crappy plastic clips suitable only for old style fans.

The time constant for the CPU+plus cooling system is a good

The USG has taken escalating measures against e-gold, and these
have certainly had a substantial effect, but e-gold could lose
all its US infrastructure without very bad effect.  It is also
somewhat protected by muslim-jewish tensions.  Some Muslim
governments might well see aggressive US measures against
e-gold operations in their territories as a part of a Jewish
plot to trap the world in the coils of compount interest.
E-gold transactions are traceable.  E-gold does cooperate with
the US government, and lots of other governments, but the trace
is apt to come to a dead end in gold or cash.  It is hard to
get a bank account or credit card with an alternate ID, it is
easy to get an e-gold account with no ID, like the old style
Swiss Bank accounts.   E-gold requests true names, but has no
enforcement of them or checking of them.   This lack of
enforcement is arguably illegal, but it continues.     --digsig

It is often argued that since war, violence, etc, are public goods,
only a state can efficiently defend against states.  Yet in most wars
since 1980, non state entities have done most of the heavy lifting
-loose coalitions containing many independent groups, for example the
contras, the holy warriors that overthrew the Taliban.
Looking at the events of World War II, it looks to me that it does
indeed require a state to conquer and occupy a hostile government, as
the US conquered and occupied Germany, but the Japanese army was
broken by a thousand small groups.
Defeating a large scale evildoer is a public good - but large scale
evil consists of many acts of small scale evil, and defeating each
particular small scale evil act is a private good.
When it came to the part of the war that was purely a public good,
conquering the German and Japanese homelands, America did indeed bear
almost the whole burden, but when it came to defending Australia
against the Japanese, the Australians bore the major burden, and
similarly for most other battlefields outside of the aggressors'
homelands.  Most German troops died fighting Russians in Russia, not
Americans in Germany. The particular victims of particular Japanese or
German acts of aggression counter attacked those particular Japanese
or Germans attacking them.
National defense, or at least some forms of national defense, such as
destroying Hitler's Germany, is a public good, and genuinely anarchist
societies are apt to under provide public goods.
On the other hand governments tend to provide the wrong kind of public
goods, providing what serves their purposes rather than the supposed
purpose of the public good,  Further, when a government gets in the
business of providing a some supposed public good, it creates a lobby,
which results in the public good being over provided, thus for example
ever lengthening copyright, ever more expansive patents for ever more
trivial "inventions", and, of course, the infamous military/industrial
complex, such as Haliburton.
War, for example destroying Hitler's Germany, is the most plausibly
essential public good, the strongest justification for the state.  But
when we look at the defeat of the Soviet Union, or the defeat of the
Taliban, this argument looks considerably weaker.  The heavy lifting
in those wars was done by loose alliances of small groups, for example
the holy warriors and the contras, which did not rely on a single
large centralized authority to support the public good of defeat of an
oppressive regime.
In the second world war, public good theory would lead us to expect
that the most powerful state, America would bear almost the whole
burden of defeating the threat, and smaller states would hang back and
cheer the winner.
The holy warriors were probably effective against the Soviets because
each holy warrior was defending his home, and each small group of holy
warriors were defending their village. Among the contras, it appears
that the Indian contras defended the Indians against forced
collectivization, breaking up collectives with extreme violence and
killing the collectives functionaries and administrators, often in
disturbingly unpleasant ways, but failed to participate in other
contra struggles.
Thus anarchic forms of society appear to be capable of waging war
defensively with considerably effectiveness, but are considerably less
capable of taking the war to places far away.
This is not such a severe limitation as it might appear, since the
Soviet Union was overthrown by essentially defensive wars, leading to
the dominoes falling all the way to Moscow.
It is the nature of Islam to impose dhimmitude on nonbelievers,
without much regard for official state boundaries.  "Dhimmitude" being
a dangerously inferior status where one's property is insecure, and
women are apt to be raped.  Existing Muslim states often fail to
prosecute crimes against infidels, and when crimes are prosecuted,
penalties are slight.
The West has tried to confine Dhimmitude inside a system of states -
the Muslims can oppress their minorities inside Muslim state
boundaries all they like, but cannot oppress outside Muslim state
boundaries.  This artificial boundary bends under pressure, creating
the conflict we now see.
The anarchic equivalent of the current policy of imperial state
building, would be to enter mutual defense arrangements with dhimmi,
without regard to state boundaries.
The Taliban had imposed Dhimmi status on Muslims they did not agree
with in Afghanistan.  An anarchic America would not be able to occupy
Iraq, nor would it be capable of "building democracy" in Afghanistan,
but it would be able to do the equivalent of sending special forces to
assist the Northern Alliance.

French nobles were taken prisoner in the usual fashion, but executed

You have this garbled.
According to
by the fifteen hundreds, the very finest armor could deflect almost
all bodkin arrows - but very few could afford a complete set of the
very finest armor - and the battle of Agincourt occurred well before
the fifteen hundreds.
Presumably the armor improved (and became heavier and more expensive)
in response to the battle of Agincourt.

Voting is not a solution.
Voting only encourages them.  If you vote for a candidate, and he
wins, he will then proceed to commit various crimes, and you, by
voting, have given him a "mandate" for those crimes.
Further, suppose you think, as I think, that candidate A is a lesser
evil than candidate B, but the difference is not much. If you vote for
the lesser evil, you will start to rationalize and excuse all the
crimes he commits, identifying with him, and his actions.
Nor is Kerry a solution.
I cannot understand why you Bush haters are so excited about this
election when on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kerry promised to
continue all Bush's policies only more effectually.
You vote for Kerry because you think he is a liar?

The english army was well disciplined, and in battle did what it what
it was told.  About half way through the battle of Agincourt, King
Henry decided he could not afford so many troops guarding so many
prisoners, and told them kill-em-all.   Nobility had nothing to do

Maps near enough.  The Chinese concept of "legalism" is barely
distinguishable from German concepts of communism and nazism.
However Confucianism vs Daoism/Taoism is rather different from what
you would get in the west.  Confucianism is somewhat similar to what
you would get if western cultural conservatives allied themselves with
nazi/commies, in the way that the commies are prone to imagine
conservatives have supposedly allied themselves with nazis.  Taoism
somewhat similar to what you would get if anarcho capitalists allied
themselves with pagans and wiccans, in the way that conservatives are
prone to imagine that they have, though in reality the pagans and
wiccans line up with the greenies and nazis, for the most part.
This is the result of a Chinese heritage of politicide and mass
murder, whereas the west has a heritage of compromise and negotiation.
So in the west, we have ordinary people forbidden from doing banking
stuff, but a pile of loopholes in that law, and we do not have the
death penalty for unauthorized banking, whereas in China, they do have
the death penalty, and despite the death penalty, massive defiance of
the law.

No he does not quote primary and secondary sources.  He purports to
paraphrase primary and secondary sources, When he actually quotes, as
he rarely does, he quotes only very small fragments in elaborate and
contrived false context, often using made up quotes which resemble,
but differ from the original in vital ways.  The "famine" in
Afghanistan is a case in point, which has already been discussed in
the newsgroups.  The sources in original context did not make the
claims he attributed to them.
I have provided a paragraph by paragraph comparison of source
materials with Chomsky's claims about source materials for the issue
of the Khmer Rouge - see  but the same
story could be written, and indeed has been written, of everything he
writes.  If you complain that his lies in support of the Khmer Rouge
are old news, I will do a similar number on his more recent lies about
the Afghan famine.

Started soon after the Qing dynasty
When the Song dynasty attempted to appoint important people, they did not necessarily become important people, and when it attempted to dismiss important people, they did not stay dismissed - The Song dynasty was unable or unwilling to give full effect to Confucianism.  The local potentates conspicuously failed to behave in a properly confucian manner towards the emperor.
The Song emperor could not reliably make local authorities obey him, which mean that his confucian mandarins could not reliably stop anyone other than themselves from thinking - much as today
the communists are unable to stop anyone other than themselves
from banking - in part because they are reluctant to apply the
rather drastic measures that they have frequently threatened to

That is the revisionist version - that china was a free and capitalist society, therefore freedom is not enough to ensure modernity and industrialization - a proposition as ludicrous as similar accounts of more recently existent despotic states.
China during that period was the classic exemplar of "oriental despotism", the place on which the idea is based.
But the Cultural Revolution was merely a bunch of teenagers obeying orders, merely the simulation of a mass movement, with
mass compliance instead of mass initiative.

My delusion is evidently widely shared:  I did a google search for legalism.    The first link, and many of the subsequent links, equated legalism with totalitarianism, or concluded that legalism resulted in Pol Pot's goons mostly murdered people by killing them with a hoe, and mostly tortured people with burning sticks.  Does this make Pol Pot's Cambodia not a modern nation state?
What made the Ch'in empire a modern despotism was total centralized control of everything, and a multitude of regulations with drastic penalties for non compliance. Telephones are irrelevant.  It was the liberal use of the death penalty for non compliance, not the telephone, that made it When a provincial commander marched fresh conscripts from place A to place B, he would do it in the time alloted, and be there on the date specified, or the Ch'in emperor would cut his head It is the cut-his-head off bit, and the minute and overly detailed instructions concocted by a far away bureaucracy, that made it a modern totalitarianism.
Analogously, in the recent war, Iraqi troops failed to blow several bridges because they had to wait for orders from Saddam.  Wireless and telephone did not help.
So was the Soviet empire.
So was Stalin's Soviet Empire, and Pol Pot's Cambodia, in the highly unusual sense of "decentralized" that commie/nazis use. Pol Pot's Cambodia was, like Ch'in dynasty china, decentralized in that they had twenty thousand separate killing fields, but was, like Ch'in dynasty china, highly centralized in that the man digging a ditch dug it along a line drawn by a man far away who had never seen the ground that was being dug.     --digsig

The mainstream Confucian belief, like the mainstream legalist
belief, was that the emperor should have absolute power.  The
Qing dynasty was successful in giving effect to this belief,
and justified that effect on confucian grounds.  This makes
them more confucian, not less confucian, than the Sung dynasty,
for the Sung were confucian merely in intent, much as the
current chinese regime is communist merely in intent.
The Qing dynasty prohibited anyone other than themselves from
owning seagoing boats - that is why I called it the equivalent
of the iron curtain.

sailing, so the intent was not fear of foreigners, but as with

That seems improbable:   Qin had a cult of personality, in
which every single person subject to his control had to
participate.   A subject of Qin, like a subject of Mao,  was
more aware of Qin, than he was of his mother and father.
The proposition that the chinese emperors ruled with a light
hand is historical revisionism.  Some of them ruled with a
moderately heavy hand, some of them with an extremely heavy
hand, and Qin was as heavy as it gets.
I did not pack them in to one simplistic grid - I said that
legalism was much the same thing as communism/nazism, whereas
Confucianism is a mixture of that, and also of rule by social
conservatives.  The rule of Qin was very similar to commie nazi
rule.  The rule of Qianlong was substantially different.  Both
were despots, but Qianlong was no totalitarian.     --digsig

Bullshit.  Everyone knew that which the regime decided they
must know.  And if true, which I very much doubt, you are not
only arguing that Qin's legalism was a different thing than
communism/nazism, you are also arguing that Mao's communism was
a different thing than Stalin's communism.
It was a lot harder to get to Afghanistan from Moscow than to get to any place in China from Peking, yet every Afghan child knew in painfully excessive detail what Moscow commanded them to know, and the regime was partially successful in preventing them from knowing what it wished them to not know.
When, during the great leap forward, Peking commanded unreasonable grain requisitions from the provinces, *all* provinces contributed, and *all* provinces suffered starvation.
It is often said that Mao's famine was an unfortunate accident, while Stalin's famines were intentional, but any differences are merely a matter of greater self deception.  Both did the same things for the same reasons, but Stalin justified his actions by anti peasant rhetoric - "liquidation of the kulaks", whereas Mao justified his action by pro peasant rhetoric, but this is a mere difference in the emphasis in the rationalizations and propaganda, not any difference in means and ends.
Both used ruthless terror to establish extraordinary control over a far flung empire that had formerly been ruled by relatively light hand, and then used that extraordinary control to extort extraordinary resources from the peasantry.  The difference between Stalin's frequent references to the poor peasants (who were supposedly carrying out the liquidation of the kulaks in revolutionary zeal) and Mao's similar references is merely that Mao was more thorough in creating the simulation of a mass movement.     --digsig

the relationship with our former anti communist allies, and

And if we do nothing, we are also blamed for making things worse:  Observe, for example
1.  the French assist the Hutus to commit genocide against the Tutsis.  Capitalism and America get blamed.
2. The Indonesians massacre infidels.  Capitalism, Americans and America get blamed.
3.  Saddam massacres his people.  The CIA, Americans and America get blamed.
4.  Syria invades Lebanon.  America and Israel get blamed.
5.  Africans massacre each other in the Congo.  America gets blamed.  (Oddly, for once, the CIA, capitalism, and Jews, are not involved.)
The dogs bark and the caravan moves on.
They would like that also.  Fortunately all the oil is Kurds, or Shiites - the first areas to be secured once the civil war burns down a bit.
But it is easy and cheap to remove people.  It is installing people that is hard, bloody, and expensive.
If the dice turn out badly, just roll them again.

Seems to me that permanent civil war in Iraq provides Americans
with the same benefits as democracy in Iraq, though
considerably more reliably.
Chances are that after fair and free election, the majority
will vote to screw the minority - literally screw them, as in
rape being unofficially OK when members of the majority do it
to members of the minority.
Nothing like a long holy war with no clear winner to teach
people the virtues of religious tolerance.  That is, after all,
how Europeans learnt that lesson.
And the worst comes to the worst - well today the Taliban are
busy kiling Afghans instead of Americans.  Wouldn't it be nice
if Al Quaeda was killing Iraqis instead of Americans - well
actually they are killing Iraqis instead of americans, but
wouldn't it be nice if they were killing *more* Iraqis?

Nonsense.  The ugly thing about the period before Taliban rule
was that the Taliban, or people of much the same ideology,
would persistently destroy murder and rape in order to get
people to submit to their rule.  When opposition largely
collapsed, their massacres did not cease, though their rapes
became more discrete.  Instead, they decided to expand their
terror onto a wider stage.
The war was not warlord vs warlord, it was radical Islamists vs
the rest, the rest being warlords and conservative Islamists. The radical Islamists won, but victory did not appease their
appetite for terror.
All the big crimes were committed by the Taliban or their ally

Permanent holy war in Iraq would keep them busy and out of
mischief WITHOUT permanent large involvement from American
Plus, of course, they would be pumping oil like mad in order to
fund it.
Finding Al Quaeda is hard.  Nation building is even harder.
Military training covers nation smashing, not nation building.
But arranging matters so that Al Quaeda is busily killing those muslims it deems insufficiently Muslim, and muslims are killing
Al Quaeda right back, seems astonishingly easy.   It is like
throwing a match into a big petrol spill.  Why are American
soldiers getting shot putting out the fire?   Why are Americans
dying to stop arabs from killing arabs? We *want* arabs to kill
arabs.  When arabs kill arabs, we fear that the wrong side
might win - but whichever side wins, it usually turns out to be the wrong side.   If no one wins, no problem.
But we learnt from history.  Europe, and Europeans, did learn
from the European holy wars.
First:  Three cheers for Timothy McViegh.
Secondly, the people who organize large scale terror can be identified, particularly by locals and coreligionists, which is
why they have been dying in large numbers in Afghanistan.

that makes the oppressed masses supposedly warmly embrace their

The violence of which you speak was not warlords fighting
warlords, but the Taliban and its predecessor attacking men
women and children, for example the shelling of Kabul.
The relief that people expected to obtain by submitting to
Taliban rule was not relief from fighting each other, but
relief from indiscriminate Taliban attacks.

I would like to clarify my own position, which is in some important ways different from your own:  I am not in favor of myself, or any one else in America, being sacrificed for the greater good of Iraqi democracy, and since Iraqi democracy is likely to consist of 51% voting to bugger the other 49%, I can understand the position of those Iraqis who are fighting to resist the imposition of democracy.  But if they fight by taking hostages and mutilating them on television, then by all means let us have them sodomized.  I don't want Americans sent to fight by their stupid government, but if they are sent to fight, I am in favor of them winning and the guys they are fighting dying, and if it means destroying the village to save it, serves the goat fuckers right.     --digsig

The planet where the Afghans held an election, in which nearly
everybody voted, some of them several times, and the Taliban
were unable to carry out any of the threats they made against
the voters, which indicates that the Afghans have been pretty
efficient in killing Taliban.
The average Afghan warlord is untroubled by any of this crap. He sees someone who looks suspicious, says "Hey, you don't look
like you are from around here.  What are you doing?"  If he
does not like the answers, he brings out his skinning knife,
and asks a few more questions.  If the answers make him even
more unhappy, he hands his skinning knife to the womenfolk, and
tells them to take their time.
The parties that sponsored death squads of Latin America, when
victorious, held free and fair elections, which they won, and
those they had been fighting lost.  The death squads were an
response to Soviet sponsored attempts to subjugate, enslave and
terrorize Latin America, and when the Soviet Union passed, so
did the death squads.
It seems most unlikely that Al Quaeda, the Taliban, and the
rest, if victorious would hold free and fair elections, or be
capable of winning them.

The stasi are not a callin yet on ecash, and have not been particularly effective against people publishing bittorrents.
People issuing e-cash systems want to be irrevocable and anonymous, in part because the market niche for revocable payments is occupied by paypal and credit card companies, but they are running into trouble from fraudsters.  They also have trouble from states, but as yet the trouble from states is merely the usual mindless bureaucratic regulatory harassment that disrupts all businesses, not any specific hostility to difficult-to-trace extranational payments.
Lots of people have tried it, with varying degrees of success. Not much demand for it yet.  A big problem is that whenever any such a website achieves some degree of acceptance, a storm of fake websites appear imitating its name, its look and feel, with urls that looks very similar.     --digsig

Way back at the beginning, cypherpunks said that the internet could result in alarming loss of privacy, or alarming improvement in privacy.  As events turned out, it went to alarming loss of privacy, as Bill Gates, Oliver North and the porn sites have discovered.
The problem is not irreversible.  If Oliver North had consulted a ten year old, the kid probably would have told him how to make sure his emails were really deleted.
I would have thought that the anti-trust debacle would have inspired Bill Gates to give higher priority to privacy preserving software.

There are probably a few innocents in Guantenamo, but they released at least one Al Quaeda terrorist who promptly got back in business murdering large numbers of people, and was caught doing it - so presumably they have released lots of others who have committed lots of murders, and not been caught doing it.
Anyone who was non Afghan and in Afghanistan in the middle of the war without a good explanation should have been executed by the Northern Alliance or imprisoned permanently in Guatenamo.
Yes, I do support internment, as wartime measure, during real war, against an ethnically based enemy.

They are more evil that we are, as demonstrated by their propensity to kill all sorts of people, including each other, and including us. This forces us to do something violent. Imposing democracy on Iraq at gunpoint was probably a bad idea, but it was selected as the option that would raise the least objection.  Any more effectual measure is going to piss you lot off even more.  A more effectual measure and considerably less costly measure would have been to confiscate Iraq's and Saudi Arabia's oil reserves, and ethnically cleanse all male muslims above the age of puberty from the oil bearing areas.  This democracy stuff did not work in Haiti and things look considerably more difficult, and more expensive, in Iraq.     --digsig

When e-currency handlers (cambists) are accused of money laundering terrorist's money, the feds steal the money, but they do not obstruct them from travelling, or, surprisingly, even from doing business - well, perhaps not so surprisingly, for if they stopped them from doing business there would be nothing to steal.
When the state uses repressive measures against those that seek to murder us, there is still a large gap between that and using repressive measures against everyone.
We are not terrorists, we don't look like terrorists, we don't sound like terrorists. Indeed, the more visible real terrorists are, the less even Tim McViegh looks like a terrorist and the more he looks like a patriot.
When people are under attack they are going to lash out, to kill and destroy.  Lashing out an external enemy, real or imaginary, is a healthy substitute for lashing out at internal enemies.  We do not have a choice of peace, merely a choice between war against external or internal enemies.   Clearly, war against external enemies is less dangerous to freedom.
War is dangerous to freedom, but we do not have a choice of peace.  The question is where the war is to be fought - in America, or elsewhere.  War within America will surely destroy What we need to fear is those that talk about the home front and internal security, those who claim that Christians are as big a threat as Muslims - or that black Muslims are as big a

If only it were true.  That is why I recommend readily achievable goals, like stealing the oil, rather than goals that require direct involvment mano a mano.
But in reality, the US government is pursuing goals such as "building democracy" that require Americans to walk the streets of Baghdad, a daily exercise of tremendous courage.
Here is my prescription for winning the war on terrorism
We SHOULD rely on shock and awe, administered by men in white coats far from the scene.
A number of governments are disturbingly tolerant of terror. Usually they are only tolerant of terror against their non Islamic subjects, and disapprove of external terror committed by their subjects against outsiders, but the two cannot readily be separated.  One leads to the other.
The US government should expose and condemn these objectionable practices, subvert moderately objectionable regimes, and annihilate more objectionable regimes.  The pentagon should deprive moderately objectionable regimes of economic resources, by stealing their oil, destroying their water systems, and cutting off their trade and population movements with the outside world.
Syria should suffer annihilation, Iran subversion, Sudan some combination of annihilation and subversion, Saudi Arabia and similar less objectionable regimes should suffer confiscation of oil, destruction of water resources, and loss of contact with the outside world.     --digsig

Lots of murderous terrorists have been released from Guatanamo, and in the nearly all cases the most serious of their complaints make it sound like a beach resort, except for the fact that they could not leave.
A few have more serious complaints.  Either they are lying or, those who say they were well treated apart from being held captive are lying. It is hard to believe that people like Slimane Hadj Abderrahmane (who after release announced his intention to resume terrorist activities and that he would
attempt to murder his hosts who lobbied to get him release) are
lying to cover up torture by the US army.

When people are under attack, you cannot tell them to suck it up, which is what you are doing.  If we had no government, we might well be doing pogroms against american muslims - and a good thing to.
War causes governments, and causes governments to gain power, but the US government was not the aggressor in this war.   US government meddling in the middle east was unwise and unnecessary, but it did not provoke, nor does it justify, this The intent of a large minority of muslims was to start a holy war between the west and Islam, and the majority of muslims lack the will or courage to stop them, or even criticize them. That was not the intent of Americans, or the American government.  They started it, they meant to start it. Americans
tried to avoid it, some of them are still trying to avoid it. All Americans are still trying to conduct the war on the
smallest possible scale, against the smallest possible subset
of Islam, disagreeing only on how small that subset can be.     --digsig

This used to be a self flattering delusion, is now a lie. US
records have been opened, we know that the overthrow came as a
complete surprise to the US, and that initially the US did not
know whose side Lon Nol was on.
What happened was that Sihanouk's allies, the North Vietnamese,
attacked him.   This discredited Sihanouk's foreign policy, and
Sihanouk himself, and led to those who sought to save Cambodia
from Vietnamese domination, sought to avoid the installation of
the (then seemingly puppet) Khmer Rouge, overthrowing Sihanouk.
Shawcross, no friend of the US, reluctantly conceded this after
doing a big freedom of information thing.
You live in a world of delusion.  Your dates are all wrong,
your events are all fiction.
The Khmer Rouge were primarily backed by the Soviet Union at
first.  When it became apparent that they were not the puppets
that those who organized them and initially armed them intended
them to be, they subsequently received more backing from China,
and less from the Soviet Union, but they were brought to power
by support from both China and the Soviet Union.
The US never followed an aggressive policy towards the PRC.
Sihanouk was friendly, indeed abjectly servile, to the North
Vietnamese and the Soviet Union, yet the North Vietnamese
created the Khmer Rouge and attacked Cambodia.
Same thing happened with Laos, where the Americans never got
involved at all to any significant extent.     --digsig

All of the terrorists came from countries that were
beneficiaries of an immense amount of US help.  Saudi Arabia
was certainly not under attack.  If they were Palestinians, and
they hit the Pentagon but not the two towers, then they would
be defending themselves.

Most of them were non Afghans in Afghanistan in the middle of a war and no plausible explanation of their presence, which makes it fairly certain they had signed up Bin Laden and company.  So if they had not personally targeted women and children, they had signed up with an organization that they know rapes and murders.   Don't give me that moral relativism crap that their view of themselves as heroes is as just as valid as our view of them as vicious subhuman monsters.
Different rules apply in war.
Now if the president got away with the principle that an "enemy combatant captured in time of war" is anyone the president designates as an enemy combatant, *then* I would be worried about the fact that they did not get trials and all that.
In a guerilla war or terrorist war, war rules are even more dangerous to liberty than usual since the battlefield is everywhere.   However in this case the application of the rules of war, rather than peace, is legitimate.  They are for the most part foreigners picked up in Afghanistan, where the usual wartime rule is that if you cannot give a plausible account of yourself, they will skin you.
While we should be very concerned that the chronic war on terror may lead to rules of war extending to everyday life, rules of war are still necessary to deal with large scale enemies with the capability to control territory and exclude the forces of justice.  We should not apply rules of war to some terrorists snatched in New York - that would be dangerous to the freedom of the ordinary New Yorker, but if the government snatches terrorists in Afghanistan or near Fallujah, rules of war should apply.

Firstly, much of the Taliban is Pakistani, not Afghan.
Secondly, if the Taliban were legitimate, their enemies may
lock them up for the duration of the war as POWs, Since some
elements of the Taliban have not laid down their arms, Taliban
prisoners may held for the duration, as POWs, even if they
fought in a manner equivalent to fighting in uniform.
The Taliban were illegitimate, not on legal grounds, but
because they were evil.
 If someone was in the Taliban, then those threatened by the
Taliban have a strong case for locking him up, just as we
locked up nazis. Thirdly a government that systematically
depopulates large areas of the territory it supposedly rules is
not as legitimate as warlords with genuine local roots and
traditional authority, who for the most part came to power
through religious or military leadership in a spontaneous
revolution against tyranny.  No one in the Northern alliance
ever controlled territory though ethnic cleansing.
I can easily imagine circumstances where ethnic cleansing is a
legitimate response to an intransigent enemy with strong roots
in the local population - but the fact that the Taliban used
such measures shows they did not have strong roots in the local
population.     --digsig

You are just spouting bullshit, like the story that Osama Bin
Laden was trained by the CIA, that Saddam was installed in a
CIA coup, and all those similar lies made up to rationalize
terror.  Just a few posts ago someone posted that old one that
the US started the Korean war by attacking North Korea, in
order to make the US rich by imposing poverty on Koreans,
despite the fact that we now have the records of Stalin
ordering the attack, and despite the obvious and dramatic
difference in wealth everywhere between the two sides of the

Terrorist:  One who uses terror as a means of coercion.
The word was originally coined to describe the committee of
public safety created by the french revolution, and was
subsequently used to decribe similar regimes, most of them
revolutionary, for example Lenin's.  However it is equally
applicable to non government groups who use similar measures. The difference between guerrilas and non government terrorists
is that terrorists target random innocents - for example
blowing up schoolchildren for accepting candy from US soldiers,
as recently happened in Iraq.  Similarly the deliberately
capricious executions by most communist regimes, intended to
produce a sense of fear and helplessness in their subjects.
McViegh did not target innocents.  Bin Laden did target
innocents.     --digsig

The same consensus as runs the international human rights commission that condemns Israel while blessing Sudan?
The ICC and the world court have a track record that resembles the lowest common demoninator of the governments that sponsor it - They support tyrrany, terror, and slavery, and shattering confiscation of property.
For all that is wrong with the US government, remember the condition  of people under the great majority of the world: poverty and fear, where the political privilege of a few shatters the economy and forces the vast majority into poverty, for example India, Burma, Nigeria, Vietnam, Pakistan, Cuba Indonesia, and all the rest.

Bin Laden's intent was to make anyone in America afraid - thus the use of airliners, rather than truck bombs.   McViegh's intent was to make BATF afraid.
Analogously, in Iraq, the murder of schoolchildren for accepting candy from Americans, the use of children as human If group A, acting as an organized cohesive entity with single central will, makes people belonging to group B rationally afraid by violent and evil acts, and someone in group B strikes back at group A in order to make group A afraid to do wrong, this is not terrorism, even if innocents happen to get in the way. If instead he goes after the guy who washes the windows

Mass movements of this kind require the promise of inevitable
victory. When communism suffered one decisive, uncomplicated,
unambiguous defeat, the dominos fell one after another all the
way to Moscow.  The remaining communists have made some
psychological recovery - see for example Tyler Durden's
peculiar version of recent history, where in his universe the
communists actually won and are still winning, and similarly
the Islamists have made a considerable psychological recovery
from Afghanistan, but the ideal of date with destiny tends to
lose its appeal when you keep picking yourself off the dirt
with a bloody nose.
In Iraq we face a guerrila movement, and discover, yet again,
that guerrilas can only be defeated by local forces - and the
boys from Baghdad are not all that local.  This gives the
Islamicists renewed hope.
So what do you do, if, like Israel, you face terrorists
embedded in a local population that supports thems sufficiently
they can melt into the people?  Withdrawal did not work, for
the terrorists keep sending car bombs and the like from their
stronghold, as in Fallujah.
What worked in Afghanistan was to find some local warlord we
could live with, someone in no hurry to get his six pack of
virgins, someone who might want to put sacks over the heads of
the women of his town, but had no grandiose ambitions to stuff
all the women of the world into bags, and then we cut a deal
with him - we help him his slay his enemies, he helps us slay
our enemies.
Unfortunately the US plan to bring democracy to the middle
east, and to preserve Iraq as a unitary state, keeps getting in
the way of this sort of deal.     --digsig

We saw that when the Soviet Union fell, the US lost interest in central America, and peace and democracy broke out in central America with the victory of those forces that had formerly received US backing, and the defeat of those forces that had formerly received Soviet backing, showing that US meddling in central America, was, as it was claimed to be, a defensive response to Soviet meddling, a defensive response that had the support of the people of central America, and that the suffering of central America was in substantial part caused by Soviet meddling.
Sure they don't trust us, but observe that in the Afghan election, Karzai got 56% of the vote, and the soft-on-the-taliban guys got much the same vote as the supposed representatives of the oppressed masses in Central America - down in the asterixes.  I predict a very similar election outcome in Iraq.  Sadr may get a dangerously large vote,
possibly as large as the Nazis got in the Weimar republic, but
anyone who looks aligned with the car bombers will be down in
the asterixes.

The underlying theory is that Zionism/Neo Conservatism is pretty much the same thing as national socialism, only with "Jewish" substituted for Aryan.  There is some truth in the
theory, but those so sensitive to the mote in Israel's eye,
fail to notice the beam in their own eye - fail to notice that
Communism etc is pretty much the same thing as national
socialism, only with various oppressed masses substituted for

The US never intended to use its military might to defeat an
unconventional enemy.
It intended to use its military might in the entirely conventional way
to destroy or deter governments that foster terrorism, as was
accomplished very successfully in Afghanistan.
Regime change in Iraq was supposed to deter Syria and Iran, but they
have not in fact been deterred.  Saudi Arabia and Libya have been
deterred.  Indonesia has changed its policy on terror, but it is
unclear whether this was the result of the spectacle of Saddam and his
bullet ridden sons or honest soul searching.

But the Saudi Arabian elite, of among which Bin Laden was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, are not getting screwed over.
Similarly, the Javanese are not get screwed over.  In an entirely literal sense, they are doing the screwing, in that boys and girls among racial and religious minorities subject to their power tend to get raped, and the rapists and murderers go unpunished.
Secondly, these guys are no more fundamentalists than the World Council of Churches, or liberation theologians, whose views strongly resemble those of the terrorists, are fundamentalists.  They tend to talk about Islam overthrowing Capitalism, a proposition that would have seemed wholly bizarre to Mohammed, who talked about Islam overthrowing Christendom.
A christian fundamentalist believes he bases his religion on Christ and the twelve Apostles.  The terrorists do not believe they base their religion upon Mohammed and the four rightly guided Caliphs.  Rather they base their religion on much later authority.   Bin Laden even claims the Turkish Calphate represented proper religious authority, a view that is extremely whacky among Muslims.   The views of many of the terrorists have a resemblance to those of caliph al-
Hakim, holds that living theological authority is supreme, and casually rewrite the positions of dead theological authority - a position whose Christian equivalent is analogous to "High Church", which is generally regarded as the opposite of fundamentalist.

--
 "Properly finance" means that speech will be defined as
paid for, even if no actual money changes hands.   The proposed rule brings what was formerly speech into the definition of expenditure, even if assigning a money value is arbitrary.
There is no real distinction between individual speech and campaign expenditure so broadly defined.  Any distinction between the campaign and individual citizens is merely some arbitary cutoff.  Perhaps comments in "A" list blogs might be defined as campaign expenditure, and comments in other blogs might be defined as individual.
The obvious rule is "If the campaign does not pay money for it, it is not a campaign expenditure", but this rule is declared to be a loophole, a loophole that must be corrected - and of course it is a loophole.  But it is a loophole that cannot be fixed without massive violation of free speech.  Fixing this "loophole" is what is meant by "properly finance".
To fix this "loophole", speech must be deemed to be campaign speech, at least if it is sufficiently prominent, and if it is not in fact paid for directed and planned by the campaign, this will be an offense, a form of fraud, cheating the campaign laws.
This rule (speech is money, and unpaid for, unsupervised electoral speech is fraud) already applies in the offline world - thus the NRA is forbidden to inform voters about the way a particular politician votes on guns - at least forbidden to do so shortly before election time, because that would supposedly be a campaign expenditure.  To get around this rule, the NRA has purchased some radio stations, thus availing itself of the press exemption, which allows the press, but not ordinary mortals, to comment on political races.
The question then, is how will this prohibition against political speech on specific politicians and campaigns be applied to the internet.  "A" list blogs claim to be the press, so the argument is that "A" list blogs should be exempt from this rule because they are the press, "B" list blogs exempt because they are individuals, so no regulation of internet speech. Evidently some people
reject this argument.     --digsig

References: <42484635.17176.D9C8400
    --
James A. Donald:
Trusting the mail server is merely the default.  The user can use a different password for the certificate server, and if that password is strong enough to resist offline attack, he does not have to trust the certificate server - but all that is "advanced cryptographic options", which regular people are not expected to touch.
This does not seem to me to be a problem.  When one uses a large number of addresses one does not want external people to know, or be readily able to prove, that these multiple addresses map to a single address - therefore one wants separate keys for each address.
These multiple addresses are akin to inverse petnames. People of categoy X know you as JoeX, people of categoryY know you as JoeY, and people of the category client know you as Joe's Consulting Services In the proposed scheme, the default case is that JoeX, JoeY, and Joe's Consulting services each get globally unique public and private key, without Joe doing anything or thinking about it.  That seems correct behavior to me.
Subject should of course be signed - and in encrypted messages, subject and timestamp should be encrypted.
As in the petname prescription, petnames should be translated to global names immediately after leaving the user interface.
Zooko's triangle:
Thus in the email address, James A. Donald  "jamesd at echeque.com" is the globally unique identifier, "James A. Donald" is the nickname, which the recipient might ignore, substituting the petname "jim"
Assume the recipient has substituted "jim"
Then when the recipient reads mail from jamesd at echeque.com, he should see "jim" on the from line, even though what was sent and signed was "Hound of the Baskervilles "  (Due to the fact that I recently changed the nickname after the recipient gave me a petname - alas a user assigned petname takes precedence over a sender nicknam)
Then when the recipient replies, he should see "Jim" on the "To" line, but this gets translated to Hound of the Baskervilles  before the message is signed, encrypted, and sent. (The nickname does not get frozen in, but may change at any time, potentially causing confusion.  Still, if someone changes his nickname, he cannot complain about confusion.)
Unavoidably, digital signatures are going to be more transient than ink signatures.  It is the nature of the technology.  Fighting it will only lead to complexity and difficulty of use.  If someone values a signature, perhaps because it is a business name associated with a good reputation, he best have a personal and valuable domain name, as most such businesses do.   If you are
worried about being impersonated, you are quite likely
writing from an address something like customer_support at e-gold.com, in which case you are NOT going to move email addresses.
(Actually customer_support at egold.com never sends email because there are so many spammers forging that address. This proposal is designed to address that problem.   The names that are valuable to protect, are not going to be changed, because they are valuable.
This proposal is designed for Joe Sixpack.  Crypto Kong is not.  One probably should have "notice of change of address" capability, wherein someone can persuade other people's clients to be willing to switch the globally unique identifier associated with a petname, but I suspect Joe Sixpack would not use it correctly.  Come to think of it, I suspect I would not use it correctly.     --digsig

A procedure that was, of course, anonymous.  You
probably made a deposit in cash.
In the cypherpunk vision, internet transactions should
be blinded, so that the adversary cannot do connection
analysis.  If Ann pays Bob, the adversary can detect
this, and perhaps suspect that Ann actually is Bob.  We
do however have anonymous deposits and withdrawals from
internet transaction services, and weakly nymous
providers of accounts.
Many foreign banks go through the motions of verifying
foreign account holders true names, but not all them try
all that hard.  E-gold goes through the motions, and
sporadically enforces its acceptable use policy, which
requires you to submit true name information, but really
does not try at all for the most part, unless the shit
hits the fan.  Pecunix does not require true name
information - merely an email account at which you are
capable of receiving mail - preferably PGP mail.
WebMoney does not even require an email account.  If you
use their classic security system, their client just
generates what I assume is a private key on your
computer, and that is your identifier.
Though these systems permit governments to do connection
analysis, most governments are not terribly interested
in doing connection analysis on foreigners, and
governments do not work well with other governments.
Not that I suggest that any of this is an adequate
substitute for true Chaumian blinded transactions, but
it is a substitute, and also foreshadows demand for such
transactions, and a profitable business model based on
such transactions.  The real obstacle is that 99% of
customers cannot understand WebMoney's security, or use
Pecunix's PGP based interface.  If you try to sell them

The state was created to attack private property rights - to
steal stuff.  Some rich people are beneficiaries, but from the
beginning, always at the expense of other rich people.
Compare mafia "extortion" with government "taxation".  The
mafia charges are small in proportion as their power is small.
The Gangsta disciples charged drug dealers thirty dollars a
month for protection, and, unlike the state, actually provided
protection.   The mafia cannot afford to seriously piss off its
customers, because there is no large difference between
customer firepower and mafia firepower.  The government, on the
other hand, can afford to seriously piss of its subjects.
The federal government established its monopoly of force by
burning Atlanta and Shenendoah.  Al Capone did the Saint
Valentine's day massacre.  Big difference.

Recently existent neolithic agricultural peoples, for example the New Guineans, seldom had kings, and frequently had no form of government at all other than that some people were considerably wealthier and more influential than others, but they always had private property.
This corresponds to the cattle herding people we read depicted in the earliest books of the old testament.  They had private property, wage labor, and all that from the beginning, but they do not develop kings until the book of Samuel, long after they had settled down and developed vineyards and other forms of sedentary agriculture: Judges 17:6 "In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes"
Thus both our recent observation of primitive peoples, and our written historical record, shows that private property rights long preceded government.

was made King in order that the Romans could abduct and rape

stealing land and enserfing people.

operation was to crush the Whisky rebellion.   You could say

It is a badly bungled implementation of a really old idea.
An idea, which however, was never implemented on a large scale,
resulting in the mass use of phishing attacks.
Mutual authentication and password management should have been
designed into SSH/PKI from the beginning, but instead they
designed it to rely wholly on everyone registering themselves
with a centralized authority, which of course failed.
SSH/PKI is dead in the water, and causing a major crisis on
internet transactions.  Needs fixing - needs to be fixed by
implementing cryptographic procedures that are so old that they
are in danger of being forgetten.

Our experience of trust authorities is that they do not work. The overhead of complying with the trust authority is too
great.  Users do not do it, or they do it wrong.   Phishing is
a man in the middle attack, and SSL certificates do not prevent
SSH provides cryptographic trust without a trusted authority. So it works.  SSL does not work, because no end users have
certificates, the costs of dealing with a trusted authority
being too great, and because no one checks server certificates
except for merely formal compliance.
You could intercept any one of them, but if you intercepted a
lot of them, you would be detected.
Not that I am defending the skype network, but your argument
seems to be that the trouble with the skype network is that it
did not follow the wise and highly successful example of SSL.
Skype's encryption sucks, but it is better than SSL, and better

Your business about MACS and stuff was to prevent the adversary guessing the users session ID.  With "session fixation", the adversary does not try to guess the legitimate users session ID, instead he fools the browser of the legitimate user into using the adversary's session ID.
Adversary accesses web site as if about to log in, gets
a session ID.  Then supplies false information to someone else's browser, causes that browser on some one else's computer to use that session ID.  Someone else logs in with hacker's session ID, and now the adversary

There seem to be a shitload of protocols, in addition to SPEKE and DH-EKE
A password protocol should have the following properties:
1. It should identify both parties to each other, that is to say, be secure against replay and man in the middle attacks, in particular, strong against phishing.. It should be secure against replay and dictionary attacks by an evesdropper or man-in-the-middle.  Such an attacker should be able to no better than someone who just tries repeatedly to log on to the server with a guessed password
2.  It should be as strong as practical against offline attacks by the server itself.  The server operators, or someone who has stolen information from them, should not know the users password, and dictionary attacks should be sufficiently expensive that a strong password (not your ordinary password) is secure.
Can anyone suggest a well reviewed, unpatented, protocol that has the desired properties?     --digsig

Bittorrent, alone, starves users who leach without
reciprocating, but only in certain very limited ways.
As a result of that and swarming Bittorrent has far more
bandwidth available than any other file sharing network.  You
can download big files faster.  If you want to download big
files, use Bittorrent, or hell will freeze over before your
files complete.  But it does not have more files available,
indeed it has fewer, because there is no reward to users for
making a wide range of files available.
The enormous success of bittorrent, and its limitations, should
tell us that the principle of rewarding uploaders and storers,
and starving leachers, is pretty much central to the success of
a protocol and its software.

There will be no black market as long as the chinese government is prepared to buy US dollars from all comers at the official rate.  The black market can only happen if they start saying "well, you are just a regular person, not a proper registered business, so we will not buy your dollars, unless you give us a good explanation of how you came to have them."
In my opinion the official chinese rates are pretty much in line with reality, are reasonable and realistic. The chinese government is prepared to buy and sell unlimited dollars at the official rate, because it thinks that dollars are reasonably cheap at the official rate, and they are reasonably cheap, because they can be used to buy stuff that chinese want, and stuff that the chinese government wants.
And if the official rates are not reasonable and realistic, there will be no black market until the chinese government is simultaneously unwilling or unable to buy unlimited dollars at the official price, and also unwilling to change the official price.     --digsig

Your economics is entirely sound, but I disagree with you on one minor question of fact.  I doubt the yuan is cheaper than it should be.  Seems to me that the fundamental reason why chinese are working cheap and providing us with their excellent goods in exchange for our rather dubious and shaky dollars so abundantly
printed by the Bush administration, is that the chinese
banking system is even more dubious and shaky. Chinese

@_subject: How email encryption should work 
References: <200503270635.j2R6ZNAF017280
    --
In my blog  I post "how email encryption should work"
I would appreciate some analysis of this proposal, which I think summarizes a great deal of discussion that I have read.
Here is how email encryption should work:
    * The user should automagically get his key and     certificate when he sets up the email account,     without having to do anything extra. We should allow     him the option of doing extra stuff, but the default     should be do nothing, and the option to do something     should be labeled with something intimidating like     Advanced custom cryptographic key management so     that 99% of users never touch it.
    * In the default case, the mail client, if there are     no keys present, logs in to a keyserver using a     protocol analogous to SPEKE, using by default the     same password as is used to download mail. That     server then sends the key for that password and     email address, and emails a certificate asserting     that holder of that key can be reached at that email     address. Each email address, not each user, has a     unique key, which changes only when and if the user     changes the password or email address. Unless the     user wants to deal with advanced custom options,     his from address must be the address that the     client downloads mail from  as it normally is.
    * The email client learns the correspondent's public     key by receiving signed email. It assigns petnames     on a per-key basis. A petname is also shorthand for     entering a destination address (Well it is shorthand     if the user modified it. The default petname is the     actual address optionally followed by a count.)
    * The email client presents two checkboxes, sign and     encrypt, both of which default to whatever was last     used for this email address. If several addresses     are used, it defaults to the strongest that was used     for any one of them. If the destination address has     never been used before, then encrypt is checked if     the keys are known, greyed out if they are unknown.     Sign is checked by default.
    * The signature is in the mail headers, not the     body, and signs the body, the time sent, the     sender's address, and the recipient's address. If     the email is encrypted, the signature can only be     checked by someone who possesses the decryption key.
    * If user is completely oblivious to encryption and     completely ignores those aspects of the program, and     those he communicates with do likewise, he sends his     public key all over the place in the headers, signs     everything he sends, and encrypts any messages that     are a reply to someone using software that follows     the same protocol, and neither he nor those he     corresponds with notice anything different or have     to do anything extra  other than that when he gets     unsigned messages, a warning comes up  an     unobtrusive and easily ignored warning if he has     never received a signed message from that source, a     considerably stronger warning if he has previously     received signed mail from that source.

Not what I said, though that is one possible way of implementing the proposal.
Another possible way is that the client program hashes the password in one fashion, known to everyone, and in a different way, known to everyone, gives the second hash to the server, which then hashes that in a secret way, and the client program then constructs the secret key from both numbers.
Of course, if the user clicks on the menacing "Advanced custom cryptographic key management" he can construct the key in some other fashion.
"That server then ... emails a certificate asserting that holder of that key can be reached at that email address."     --digsig

James A. Donald:
The way to beat session fixation is to issue a privileged and impossible to predict session ID in response to a correct login.
If, however, you grant privileges to a session ID on the basis of a successful login, which is in fact the usual practice, you are hosed. The normal programming model creates a session ID, then sets variables and flags associated with that session ID in response to forms submitted by the user.  To prevent session fixation, you must create the session ID with unchangeable privileges from the moment of creation.   Perhaps you do this, but very few web sites do.     --digsig

The vast majority of phishing attacks and other forms of man in the middle attack seek to steal existing shared secrets - passwords, social security numbers, credit card numbers.
I figured that the obvious solution to all this was to deploy zero knowledge technologies, where both parties prove knowledge of the shared secret without revealing the shared secret.
Now I see that zero knowledge technologies have been deployed - or almost so:
SRP-TLS-OpenSSL     (not quite ready for prime time)
And SRP GNU-TLS Of course, actual use of these technologies means that the browser chrome, not the web page, must set up and verify the password.

One cannot scratch one's bum without fear of being sued for patent infringment.  The wheel, and a common story
line in novels, were recently patented.Why should strong
passwrod protocols be different?
But in practice, patent claims are seldom resolved in It seems to me that this is more a matter of normal deployment delays, than widespread fear of patents.
With early deployments, it is far from clear whether those paying are paying for patent  licenses, or paying for sofware and expertise.
Over time, in any given software technology, the cost of software and expertise tends to fall, eventually to near zero.  At that point, it then becomes apparent how seriously people take any patent claims.     --digsig

Some of us get spyware more than others.
Further, genuinely secure systems are now becoming
available, notably Symbian.
While many people are rightly concerned that DRM will
ultimately mean that the big corporation, and thus the
state, has root access to their computers and the owner
does not, it also means that trojans, viruses, and
malware does not. DRM enables secure signing of
transactions, and secure storage of blinded valuable
secrets, since DRM binds the data to the software, and
provides a secure channel to the user.   So secrets
representing ID, and secrets representing value, can
only be manipulated by the software that is supposed to
be manipulating it.     --digsig

Since cryptography these days is routine and uncontroversial, there is no longer any strong reason for the cypherpunks list to continue to exist.
I recently read up on the Kerberos protocol, and thought, "how primitive".  Back in the bad old days, we did everything wrong, because we did not know any better.  And of course, https sucks mightily because the threat model is both inappropriate to the real threats, and fails to correspond to the users mental model, or to routine practices on a wide variety of sites, hence users glibly click through all warning dialogs, most of which are mere noise anyway.
These problems, however, are no explicitly political, and tend to be addressed on lists that are not explicitly political, leaving cypherpunks with little of substance.     --digsig

These days, if one is seriously working on overthrowing the state by advancing to crypto anarchy (meaning both anarchy that is hidden, in that large scale cooperation procedes without the state taxing it, regulating it, supervising it, and licensing it, and anarchy that relies on cryptography to resist the state) it is not necessary or advisable to announce what one is up to.
For example, Kerberos needs to be replaced by a more secure protocol.  No need to add "And I am concerned about this because I am an anarchist"  And so one
discusses it on another list.
(Kerberos tickets are small meaningful encrypted packets of information, when they should be random numbers. Being small, they can be dictionary attacked.)     --digsig

Marxism reinterpreted history as class war, though in
fact workers tended to cooperate with bosses and make
war on competing workers, and similarly for capitalists.
Marxism also reinterpreted the doctrine of inevitable
progress as leading to a "classless" utopia, though
somehow the intellectuals would be more equal than
others in that utopia - note Marx's contemptuous and
snobbish mistreatment of actual workers, and the
striking lack of contact that Marx and Engles had with
actual workers.  Engles writings about the condition of
the working class in England are based entirely on what
one can see through the window of a coach and four
horses while being driven from a luncheon party to a
dinner party.
Since we had inevitable progress, the past necessarily had to be demonized and made alien, and the further back it went, the greater the demonization and more strange and alien the past had to be, requiring an ever greater rewrite of history.
Well time passed, and actual proletarians never showed much enthusiasm for the war effort, so by and by Marxists started looking for new wars, pouring the old wine into new bottles, the old wine being leadership by enlightened intellectuals, group warfare justifying the most horrifying misconduct, massive rewrites of history, and synchronized lying ("I heard this from the three different people, so it must be true") - and of course, far from oppressed intellectuals supposedly identifying themselves with distant groups they don't like very much.  Observe all the diesel dyke feminists supposedly passionately seeking to protect attractive heterosexual women from date rape.

they bare a striking resemblance to their parent.     --digsig

Active attacks are rare, possibly nonexistent except for
Wifi.  If NSA and the other TLAs were doing active
attacks, they would be detected some of the time.  They
don't like being detected.
If anyone does an active attack, this is a one off
event.  If someone routinely and regularly does active
attacks, the attack will be detected, the point where
they are modifying messages will be detected, and will
be bypassed.
My understanding is that SSH when using GSS KEX does not
cache the keys, which strikes me as a amazingly stupid
idea, particularly when SSH key caching has been so
successful, and when the user thinks he knows his
security comes from key caching.  The experience with
PKI suggests that it is very difficult to have security
without durable cached keys.
Attacks on DNS are common, though less common than other
attacks, but they are by scammers, not TLA agencies,
perhaps because they are so easily detected.
All logons should move to SRP to avoid the phishing
problem, as this is the most direct and strongest
solution for phishing for shared secrets, and phishing
for shared secrets is the biggest problem we now have.
Encrypting DNS is unacceptable, because the very large
number of very short messages make public key encryption
an intolerable overhead.  A DNS message also has to fit
in a single datagram.
To accommodate these constraints, we need DNS
certificates sent in the clear, and signed with elliptic
curve public keys (which allow both signatures and
certificates to be short enough to fit in a datagram).
The client walks the  certificate chain from time to
time and it caches the certificates, to avoid
excessively loading the issuers of higher level
But this is all theoretical at this stage, for DNS
attacks are not our biggest problem.  Once we have
deployed systems that make it difficult to snoop and
scam without attacking DNS, *then* we will see DNS come
under heavy attack, and *then* there will be motivation
to change the DNS system.
After all, we have not fixed or replaced PKI, despite
the enormous phishing attack that renders it useless and
irrelevant, so we are going to be slower still fixing

At present, file sharing works by barter for bits. This,
however requires the double coincidence of wants. People
only upload files they are downloading, and once the
download is complete, stop seeding. So only active
files, files that quite a lot of people want at the same
time, are available.
File sharing requires extremely cheap transactions,
several transactions per second per client, day in and
day out, with monthly transaction costs being very small
per client, so to support file sharing on bitcoins, we
will need a layer of account money on top of the
bitcoins, supporting transactions of a hundred
thousandth the size of the smallest coin, and to support
anonymity, chaumian money on top of the account money.
Let us call a bitcoin bank a bink.  The bitcoins stand
in the same relation to account money as gold stood in
the days of the gold standard.  The binks, not trusting
each other to be liquid when liquidity is most needed,
settle out any net discrepancies with each other by
moving bit coins around once every hundred thousand
seconds or so, so bitcoins do not change owners that
often,   Most transactions cancel out at the account
level.  The binks demand bitcoins of each other only
because they don't want to hold account money for too
long. So a relatively small amount of bitcoins
infrequently transacted can support a somewhat larger
amount of account money frequently transacted.

That is not the question I am asking.
It is not trust that worries me, it is how it is
possible to have a  a globally shared view even if
everyone is well behaved.
The process for arriving at a globally shared view of
who owns what bitgold coins is insufficiently specified.
Once specified, then we can start considering whether
everyone has incentives to behave correctly.
It is not sufficient that everyone knows X.  We also
need everyone to know that everyone knows X, and that
everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows X
- which, as in the Byzantine Generals problem, is the
classic hard problem of distributed data processing.
This problem becomes harder when X is quite possibly a
very large amount of data - agreement on who was the
owner of every bitgold coin at such and such a time.
And then on top of that we need everyone to have a
motive to behave in such a fashion that agreement
arises.  I cannot see that they have motive when I do
not know the behavior to be motivated.
You keep repeating your analysis of the system under
attack.  We cannot say how the system will behave under
attack until we know how the system is supposed to
behave when not under attack.
If there are a lot of transactions, it is hard to
efficiently discover the discrepancies between one
node's view and another node's view, and because new
transactions are always arriving, no two nodes will ever
have the same view, even if all nodes are honest, and
all reported transactions are correct and true single
We should be able to accomplish a system where two nodes
are likely to come to agreement as to who owned what
bitgold coins at some very recent past time, but it is
not simple to do so.
If one node constructs a hash that represents its
knowledge of who owned what bitgold coins at a
particular time, and another node wants to check that
hash, it is not simple to do it in such a way that
agreement is likely, and disagreement between honest
well behaved nodes is efficiently detected and
efficiently resolved.
And if we had a specification of how agreement is
generated, it is not obvious why the second node has
incentive to check that hash.
The system has to work in such a way that nodes can
easily and cheaply change their opinion about recent
transactions, so as to reach consensus, but in order to
provide finality and irreversibility, once consensus has
been reached, and then new stuff has be piled on top of
old consensus, in particular new bitgold has been piled
on top of old consensus, it then becomes extremely
difficult to go back and change what was decided.
Saying that is how it works, does not give us a method
to make it work that way.
You keep discussing attacks.  I find it hard to think
about response to attack when it is not clear to me what
normal behavior is in the case of good conduct by each
and every party.
Distributed databases are *hard* even when all the
databases perfectly follow the will of a single owner.
Messages get lost, links drop, syncrhonization delays
become abnormal, and entire machines go up in flames,
and the network as a whole has to take all this in its
Figuring out how to do this is hard, even in the
complete absence of attacks.  Then when we have figured
out how to handle all this, then come attacks.

Monetary value is always speculative.  It depends on the expectation that they will be used as money.
There is a small but not totally insignificant chance that after fiat  monies collapse, the world will go bitcoin standard.  There is a large  chance that the world will go gold standard.
There are about ten billion ounces of gold in the world, therefore fifteen trillion dollars worth of gold.  This value only makes sense if there is large chance that gold will be money.
There are about three hundred million dollars worth of bitcoins.
Therefore the market is valuing the chance that the world will go to a  bitcoin standard at
The current value of gold looks about right to me.  So the current value  of bitcoin is also about right - that all the gold in the world is worth  about five hundred thousand times all the bitcoins in the world.
Which is probably a fairly conservative estimate for the prospects that  the world will go bitcoin.
If the current price of gold makes sense, the current price of bitcoin  makes sense.
I would recommend putting most of one's cashi in gold, and a tiny bit of  one's cash in bitcoin.

This crisis has a lot to do with the fact that Bitcoin is doing well, and suggests demand for other cryptographic solutions.
As orthodox places to put your money and perform transactions are  increasingly suspect, people are now willing to consider unorthodox places to put their money and unorthodox means to transact, when formerly there was really no demand.
Now there is demand.  And that the crisis was caused by regulators is a  major reason for that demand.
If crypto's mission is to enable people to sign on to their banks without being phished, then this discussion is wholly irrelevant.
If crypto's mission is to enable people to do transactions without being  scammed, then existing scams not employing cryptography are wholly If government regulation was ineffectual or actively damaging, then we  need cryptographic solutions that provide security in ways that bypass the government and regulators - hence the demand for bitcoin.
If the crisis was lack of wise regulation, then we need a solution in  which all transactions are, like paypal transactions and the various cell phone money schemes, rendered visible to authority and traceable.
If the crisis was immoral and corrupt regulation, with politicians  directing money to voting blocks and regulators spinning in the revolving door between government and banks, and often changing their hats without even changing their offices, wearing a regulator hat at the same desk where a short time before they had worn a banker hat, then we need a more cypherpunkish solution - such as bitcoin, and there is customer demand for a more cypherpunkish solution.

Truecrypt supports an inner and outer encrypted volume, encryption hidden inside encryption, the intended usage being that you reveal the outer encrypted volume, and refuse to admit the existence of the inner hidden To summarize the judgment:  Plausibile deniability, or even not very  plausible deniability, means you don't have to produce the key for the  inner volume.  The government first has to *prove* that the inner volume  exists, and contains something hot.  Only then can it demand the key for  the inner volume.

When hyperinflation hits, everything becomes money except money.  Nails  are money, gold is money, moonshine liquor is money, antibiotics are money.
But when hyperinflation hits, paper is not money.
When that day comes, the problem will not be that bitcoin is cut off from fiat money, but that fiat money is cut off from bitcoin - and perhaps more importantly cut off from nails, from gold, and from moonshine liquor.
The day comes when you offer a trillion dollars for some nails, and no one will sell you the nails because they don't know, and don't much care, whether it is a British trillion or an American trillion, nor whether that makes any difference.
Paper money has been adopted several times over the last thousand years of recorded history.  What do you think happened each of the previous times?
Of course gold has a lot more history behind it than bitcoin, so chances  are will go to a gold standard rather than a bitcoin standard.  Everyone  knows that gold is money, even African peasants, while only a few geeks  think that Bitcoin is money.  But the way the wind is blowing we are going to be off fiat money soon enough.
Supposedly we are wiser now, and can now make fiat money work.  But if you look at the Assignat hyperinflation, they knew how to make fiat money work back then - until they started executing people for suggesting that inflation was happening and that it was caused by the government printing too much money, whereupon everyone who was politically correct forgot how to make fiat money work.
Something similar happened in Weimar Germany.  In Weimar Germany, unlike  Revolutionary France, they did not cut off your head for noticing that  inflation was happening or explaining what was causing it, but it was  extremely bad for your career to notice such things, so all the most  learned economists were firmly of the opinion that there was no  significant inflation, and that printing more money to provide more  welfare was extremely good for the economy, indeed so vitally necessary  that there needed to be a lot more of it.  To doubt the consensus was, as Paul Krugman frequently explains, to oppose economics and science.

Mojo nation had an automatic auction scheme:  When acting as a server your computer serviced requests starting with those offering the best price, down to the worst, thus when operating as a server, automatic price When acting as a client the client should have automatically adjusted its offers in accordance with its user's performance goals and price limits, trying automatically to pay the lowest price consistent with adequate service, trying to discover market clearing prices with minimal human intervention and make that information available to the user.  I don't think it did.  So as a server, there was automatic price discovery, as a client, there was, to the best of my knowledge, no useful automatic price discovery.  For micropayments, where your computer performs lots of transactions on your behalf without consulting you, this was an unacceptable flaw.
I have never seen a post mortem from the Mojo Nation developers.  Would  like to see one.  Perhaps one exists, and I just missed it.
Seems to me that Tahoe fails because it retreated from the goals of Mojo  Nation - as Mojo Nation itself did.
To achieve reliability, you really want a large number of servers, for a  large number of servers you need a large community, preferably the entire world as one community, but if you have large community, tahoe gives you the tragedy of the commons.  Tahoe relies on social enforcement of good behavior. A community large enough to produce benefits from shared and distributed storage is large enough that the cost of informal social enforcement of good behavior is excessive - and bad social behavior results in unreliable storage.
Also, tahoe abandons EGTP.  We need a replacement for TCP that provides  end to end encryption, protocol negotiation, and NAT tunneling.  TCP is an unworkable protocol in a large, untrusting, and untrustworthy society.  EGTP was such a replacement, or was intended to be such a replacement.
I would say that the main result of the Tahoe experiment is that you  really have to do what Mojo Nation attempted to do, and that the subset  has problems.
Bittorrent was a successful descendent of Mojo Nation, but because storage is not rewarded, torrents go unseeded.  Need to reward both storage and Mojo Nation done right would be bittorrent with the capability to support both mutable and immutable files (a torrent is an immutable file), with an incentive to seed, and with the capability to support an enormous number of inactive seeds without overhead costs.
We would like the capability to support mutable files, as tahoe does, so  that we can have lists of immutable files, as tahoe does.  Such a mutable list would be the equivalent of the pirate bay.

This was an incorrect diagnosis of the problem.  The Mojo Nation team were thinking like Keynesians.
If markets are failing to clear, prices should fall.  Even if users are  hoarding mojo, at some sufficiently low price point, supply and demand  will match.
Hoarding money can never be a problem, for that is what money is for. You are *supposed* to hoard money, otherwise it would not be worth anything.  Gold is not good for much, other than hoarding, and government paper is good for even less.
Failure of price discovery is frequently a very large problem.  Price  discovery is always arduous, laborious, costly, slow, and not very  accurate, something Keynesians blissfully ignore.
Bittorrent, by focusing on short term exchange of like data for like data, has, as was expected, a permanent and massive seeding problem.
It is not apparent to me that Tahoe has achieved the goal of reliable  storage on friendnets.  Too large a friendnet, anti social behavior makes the net unreliable, too small a friendnet, k of n storage runs into the problem that k and n are small making the net unreliable.
The problems that Mojo Nation sought to solve are still there, unsolved,  and pissing people off.
Xanadu disease.
Any reputation system will have good inputs, evil inputs, insane inputs,  and evil insane inputs.  The evil or insane inputs will be rated as good  by fellow members or sibyls of each evil or insane faction, so we will get graphs that are by some measure, in some sense, disjoint.  If one starts at a good node in the good faction, reflecting a well known good guy, everyone well linked will be good, thus connection analysis of the reputation graph generates faction subgraphs.  Faction subgraphs will typically have important highly connected nodes.  Mencius refers to such nodes as Kings.  You give your allegiance to a good King, and your problem is solved.  You give your allegiance to a bad King, you are hosed.  The graph analysis system may help you find a good King, but cannot reliably find one for you, because whatever criteria it uses will be gamed by the evil.
A simple solution is to bake a single king node into the client software - otherwise known as a central point of failure.  A default king node will, however, work, or at least fail less disastrously than a baked in king People don't really want remote storage.  They want file sharing, in some cases highly controlled sharing - sharing with only with themselves at different logins, only with other instances of themselves, being a special case of controlled sharing.
Thus, it is a communication and publication system, not a hard drive.

Here is a solution:
Everyone is, as with Bitcoin, identified by a public key - but by quite a few public keys, providing not anonymity but pseudonymity.
When you store stuff on someone else's system you issue an IOU, which IOU is anonymously transferable, using a chaumian protocol, which *does*  provide anonymity - you pseudonymously store other people's stuff, and  anonymously use the resulting IOUs to store your own stuff.
system is available by random sampling.
When stuff stored on someone else's system becomes inaccessible, you note him as unreliable, and thus decline to issue IOUs or services to him in future, though since IOUs are transferable, you are still up for any IOUs you have issued to him in the past.
The software attempts to cancel out IOUs - so that if Bob provides  services to Carol, Carol provides services to Edwards, and Edwards  provides services to Bob, they cancel out.  If someone's IOUs get  cancelled out in a cycle of IOUs that include your own, or include those  you have confidence are reliable, this is evidence he is reliable in that his IOUs are good.
You try to store stuff with those that you have reason to believe are  reliable, and with those where storing stuff with them enables you to  cancel out IOUs.
You give low priority to storing stuff from people whose IOUs you have no reason to believe.
Repeating: You pseudonymously store other people's stuff, using a nym that gains reputation thereby, and anonymously store your stuff on other  people's systems, using a nym with no reputation.

Bittorrent's notorious problem is that it does not remember anything from one torrent to the next, and does not share graph or karma data from on peer to the next, because managing shared graph data is tricky, and managing shared karma data is a great deal trickier.
This results in lack of incentive to seed, with the result that the vast  majority of torrents are unseeded.  Torrents die.
To fix this problem, people tend to form associations based on a  particular web site.  The association rewards and penalizes people  according to their upload download ratio, which is the wrong metric. The important metric is keeping approved torrents alive, the important metric is storage availability rather than bandwidth, though bandwidth matters The association has a central point of failure, its website and its  operators, who come under pressure.  One needs a distributed system that  gives people incentives to seed - that rewards people for providing other people storage and availability.
Some design characteristics:
*.  Peers are identified by a durable public key.
*.  Peers interact with keys they do not trust, but expect protocol  conformance and prosocial behavior only from keys they trust. Peers limit their exposure to non trusted keys so that they can suffer only limited damage from non trusted keys deviating from protocol or otherwise *.  Peers may not only trust Bob, but transitively everyone Bob trusts,  and everyone that those peers trust ...  If this works, they increase  their transitive trust in Bob, if it fails they decrease their transitive *.  Prosocial behavior consists of conforming to protocol, storage  availability, with valuable, or at least demanded, stuff in storage and  accessible on demand,  and paying ones bandwidth and storage debts. Since networks are unreliable, perfect protocol conformity is never expected or demanded, but the burden that one's deviations from protocol place on other peers counts against one's karma.
Thus Bob performs the functions of the website in a bittorrent association - thus every well behaved peer performs the function of the website in a bittorrent association.

Monarchy, anarcho capitalism, anarcho piratism, military dictatorship. Or perhaps a republic with the franchise limited to property owning heads of households with good credit records.
Observe that police in wealthy neighborhoods are much better than police in poor neighborhoods.  Do you think that is the result of voting?
You presumably agree that the people's popular democracies were not all that democratic, because they made sure that everyone voted communist, and a party member always got elected, and it did not matter who got elected anyway since actual decisions were made elsewhere.
Well that is pretty much the system we have in the western democracies.   The actual decisions are made by the permanent and fireproof bureaucracy. If the elections come out wrong, they ignore the result and work to make sure the next elections come out right.
Brainwashing in school, population replacement, and if that does not work, the permanent and unelected government just ignores the outcome of the vote, as for example the various votes on affirmative action and One demotic regime, turns out in practice to be remarkably similar to another demotic regime.

The level of warfare, slavery, and genocide seems to have increased steadily with the decline of kings as the world got more demotic
Those mightily indignant about slavery that substantially increased the living standards of those lucky enough "to catch the boat", as Mohammed Ali famously phrased it, just loved slavery that caused a hundred million or so to starve to death.  We also saw all the gliterati and the progressive intellectuals gathered to support Mengistu's slave state.
War increased from the days of the Restoration until World War II, after which we got the pax atomica, the peace of terror, the nuclear peace. Things were, during the nuclear peace, if not quiet, comparatively quiet.
Let us look at the middle east.  Would anyone be worried if one the monarchies had nukes?
No, they would be mightily relieved, confident that the Kings would keep the fanatics quiet.
But when the nearest thing to democracy in the middle east reaches for nuclear weapons, looks like the peace of terror may finally end in terror.

Athenian democracy self destructed much more rapidly than American democracy did, and for the next couple of millennia everyone pointed at Athens as proof that democracy was a very bad idea.
Elected officials have a very short time horizon.  Thus, for example, Obama said a whole lot of stuff that he knew would blow up in his face after the next election, because he was only worried about stuff that would blow up before the next election.  This was the big problem with Athenian democracy before its defeat in the Pelopenessian wars, the invasion of Sicily being an example of Athenian decision making ruled by short term political advantage without concern for the longer term consequence of catastrophic defeat and enormous loss of life.
Because of this problem, power tends to slide from their hands into the hands of a permanent and unelected elite, which is the situation we now have in America.  In the short term this alleviates the problems of democracy, but in the longer term, which is to say now, discipline within the permanent unelected elite breaks down, and they all steal from each other and the public, they succumb to the tragedy of the commons, which is the situation we now have.

Oligarchy suffers from the problem of tragedy of the commons, which
problem often winds up being solved by military dictatorship.
Thus democracy tends to wind up in the rule of one man, either
directly, as in the election of Napoleon the third, or by way of
oligarchy, as with Napoleon the first.

Two security failures:  The feds were able to find the Tor hidden web server, and, having found it, there was information on the web server that should not have been there.
My understanding is that they found a bunch of Tor machines, installed malware by means of rubber hoses, and thus located the Silk Road hidden web server.

Freedom hosting was forced to install malware on servers, which attacked the browsers used by tor clients.
This attack did not itself directly expose Silk Road, but Silk Road was successfully attacked at about the same time, so, possibly part of the same operation.
Silk Road was directly attacked by malware - they issued numerous complaints about this, and were repeatedly taken down by malware.  This happened at about the same time as the Freedom Hosting malware, though there is no direct evidence of a direct connection, other than timing and modus operandi.
Simply generating huge amounts of spam and firing it off at Silk Road from time to time would enable a correlation attack.  We know, however, that Silk Road was attacked both by huge amounts of spam, and malware.

After the router has been running a while, it gathers more randomness from network events, but a secret plus the boot up time will suffice at And if the router is too cheap to have a clock, so does not know the boot up time, well, pretty early in its interactions with its environment, it will be asking the time from some system that does have a clock, at which point it does have enough randomness.

If, however, he had slowly released the emails first to selected pressmen, those pressmen would not have been able to refrain from exploiting their advantage over other pressmen, and so the documents would have received coverage in the mainstream media, first one incriminating email, then the next, torture by slow drips.
So, optimal behavior is selective release of incriminating documents to specifically chosen and favored individuals, followed by gradually broader release of more and more incriminating documents to more and more people.

In a world were laws typically are many thousands of pages long, universal surveillance is a problem.
Laws and regulations have been expanding exponentially.  It is said, but is impossible to verify or falsify, that ever person with significant business interests commits around three felonies a day.
I get the impression that the rate of increase is itself increasing, which projects to a left singularity - infinite legislation in finite time in our near future, but I don't have the numbers to project when the singularity arrives.
Is there any way to find the total amount of legislation in each year?
It used to be that one could know how much regulation by sizing the federal register, but this is no longer the case.  We have already hit the event horizon of regulation, in that the federal register has ceased to have any meaning.  These days most regulations cannot be found in any well defined or meaningful place, and if they could be found it would not be much use, since current doctrine is that regulations are defeated by people merely obeying them, since this always leads to the law of unintended consequences, that mere obedience is a sneaky form of de-regulation.  Rather, those regulated should believe and have faith in the purposes for which the regulations were passed.  As was illustrated with the Bank of Beverly Hills, compliance with regulations no longer suffices: Holiness, faith, and zeal is required.  Ye shall not be saved by works, but by faith.  For Beverly Hills bank, it was insufficient to obey the regulators.  Their staff had to believe in the regulators.
We are close to reaching the same situation in legislation as we have already achieved in regulation, where legislation becomes a form of prayer, as regulation already has, so that the mere words on paper cease to have meaning or effect.

What went wrong is that all the banks were cuddling up to the regulators and telling the regulators what they wanted to hear, and in particular and especially, Washington Mutual was doing so.
Jim Bell's denial of disservice program is the opposite of cuddling up to the regulators.   Banks that cuddle will be punished, but banks that fail to cuddle will be punished more, thus he is unlikely to get support for denial of disservice, unless he disguises it as some sort of public good program to ensure that black rapists and muggers get off.
Here is a bit of background on the illegal acts committed by Washington Mutual, and how JP Morgan wound up with responsibility for these illegal acts.  I don't know what happened with Bear Sterns.
The law required equal outcomes for blacks, hispanics, and whites.
The law also required that the banks only lend to people with income and savings.  However, banks that followed that law, for example the Bank of Beverly Hills got in trouble because they were violating the equal outcomes law.
To make the regulators happy, Washington Mutual lied that its customers had income and savings.  All the banks lied, some more than others.  The bigger the lies, the happier the regulators.  The biggest liars, and the most blessed by the regulators, were Washington Mutual and Countrywide.
In 2005 November, all the lies blew up horribly in people's faces. However, from 2005 to 2008, the government required a big game of pretend and extend, in which everyone pretended the lies were true.
And, as part of the pretense that the lies were true, even though the shit had already hit the fan, JP Morgan was forced to buy Washington Mutual even though everyone knew that Washington Mutual was a stinking pile of toxic assets.
JP Morgan is now being punished for the lies told by Washington Mutual.

By default, Android, Thunderbird and Mozilla report your geographic location to Google, using gps if available, nearest wifi networks otherwise.
This appears to have enabled google's supercomputer, the planet's most powerful AI, to detect that David Petraeus was overnighting where he should not.
The official story being that this non standard overnighting raised a flag that his equipment might have been stolen, hence the need to report to friends of Obama.  Yeah, right.
I wonder if the rape charges against Julian Assange had a similar origin - did one of his numerous groupies spontaneously file false rape charges on her own initiative on discovering that other people in her circle were also having sex with Assange, or was she put up to it by people seeking to extradite Julian Assange, who proceeded to track who was sharing his bed.
I would expect that Julian Assange would assiduously turn off the tracking, but his playmates probably would not.

Evil state sponsored conspiracy.  The Cathedral. I thought everyone knew Thunderbird/tools/options/advanced/config editor/geo.enabled.
Set to disabled.
Who on this list has not done so?
Of course people usually use Thunderbird on their main computer, which generally does not have a gps, but it usually has a wifi card. Thunderbird detects the nearest wifi networks .
When google does street view for Google Earth, they also detect nearby wifi networks, so the data supplied by Thunderbird is matched against the data collected by google during street view surveys.
Thus, whenever and wherever you use Thunderbird, google can supply the authorities with the closest street address to where you are using Thunderbird, and pictures taken from the street very close to that address.  Thus the authorities not only have your email, which being sent in the clear has no expectation of privacy, but also a picture of building that you are sitting in when sending the email.

David Petraeus would disagree - particularly as he got nailed for using email from an inappropriate location, not for web browsing from an inappropriate location.  Notice while your link piously gives an innocent explanation for what Firefox is doing with a list of nearby wifi points, your link does not discuss what the hell Thunderbird is doing with a list of nearby wifi points.
The document you cite says that if you OK a website knowing where you are, your browser then sends that website (not Google) your location, which can indeed happen if you fiddle with the settings.  What, however, happens in the default setting, is that if you OK a website knowing where you are, your browser does not send them a list of your nearby wifi points, but instead tells them to request your location from Google.  There seems to be no technological reason why they cannot request your location from Google without waiting for your browser to tell them to do so, though I suppose Google might be displeased.
Which procedure implies that Google already has a list of your nearby wifi points, from which it has already deduced your location.

CAs do not work very well, because no one knows or trusts the CA, the CA does not know anyone, and it is a lot jumping through hoops to persuade the CA to trust anyone.
As a result, any procedure that has the step "First the end user gets a certificate from the CA and installs that certificate" never flies. It is just too much of a pain in the ass.
This is not matter of people fearing vast powerful quasi governmental conspiracies. (Though in view of recent leaks, you should fear vast powerful quasi governmental conspiracies)
The problem is that the CA model itself does not work.  The problem is not that they are in bed with your enemies, though they probably are. The problem is that they are not in bed with you.
x.509 is evil.
x.509 is designed for universe ruled by a single state, that state the fount of all trust, all nyms, and all relationships.
Reality, however, is that relationships and trust are predominantly peer to peer, thus anything touched by x.509 somehow always develops an absolutely horrid user interface.
When we apply x.509 to a universe far more anarchic than it was designed for, bad things happen to the UI.
What your proposed system intends to provide is reputational information.  You need some entity, a server, likely a tor hidden service, to curate reputational information, and charge a fee for doing so:  You are competing with ebay, whose main asset is their large collection of other people's reputational information.
Let us call such entities, entities that collect and curate reputational information, reputational servers, ebay being the big example of a reputational server.
You would like to be able to transport reputational information, so that it is public domain, not the private property of a given reputation server.  So you don't want reputational information to be information about joe at ebay.com, though of course you should present it that way, rather than displaying public key information directly in the UI (employ Zooko's triangle, and never throw 256 bit random numbers in the end user's face)
So, has to be the reputation of the owner of a bitcoin wallet, not the reputation of the owner of x.509 certificate.

Intel shows a circuit that should in theory output near random bits.
If the bits are actually coming from this circuit, we would expect to
see some long term anti correlation - an unusually long stream of
zeros should have a higher than random percent chance of being
followed by an unusually long stream of ones, and some short term
correlation - a zero should have a higher than fifty percent chance of
being followed by another zero, and a lower than fifty percent chance
of being followed by a one.
If we don't see that, we are not getting the raw unwhitened output, or
there is no hardware true randomness for us to get.
Conversely, if we do see that, we can be pretty sure that the circuit
exists and is producing true randomness, though of course we don't
know if that true randomness is necessarily being fed into the
whitener.  But then we don't need to use the output of the whitener,
we can feed the off white output into a software whitener.

RDSEED provides the output of the /enhanced/ non-deterministic random
number generator (ENRNG
Which is "enhanced" by being whitened.
And therefore makes it just as impossible to tell if the supposed
randomness is backdoored as RDRAND does.
What we need is the output of the entropy source.
Supposedly we have a circuit that generates fairly random offwhite
noise. (The entropy source) This is then AES encrypted (the enhanced
non deterministic number generator), and the enhanced non
deterministic random number generator then continuously seeds a pseudo
random number generator, which provides the output of RDRAND
To tell if there is a backdoor or not, we need the output of the
entropy source, unenhanced.
If the entropy source is real, it will show its analog characteristics
leaking into the digital abstraction.  The correlations and anti
correlations between nearby bits will reflect the analog values of the
circuit, thus no two chips will show quite the same correlations, and
the correlations will vary with temperature and overclocking.  These
analog variations would be compelling evidence that the entropy source
is the something very like the claimed circuit.
Because RDSEED gives us the encrypted output of the entropy source, we
cannot tell if the entropy source is a real entropy source, or a
counter encrypted with the NSA's secret key.
Since the whitening is deterministic, it is potentially reversible,
but Intel does not appear to be releasing sufficient information to
reverse it.

He needed killing, just as much as Martin Trayvon did, for much the same reasons as Martin Trayvon needed killing.
If an anti state protester, protest state power, not property.  If you are protesting property, you are a pro state protestor

Aaron Schwarz repeatedly drew attention to himself by recklessly disrupting the network shows he thought of himself as the state, and those who he harmed as not the state.  Much as Henry Louis Gates obviously considered himself the state, and a mere policeman as not the Snowden knew he risked punishment for civil disobedience, and so made his activities as normal as possible, as unobtrusive as possible. Aaron Schwarz did not know, and was so horrified to discover he was not part of the powerful that he followed in the footsteps of his hero Wallace and killed himself.

They were not "ratting" on him
A sysadmin tries to keep his systems working.  Aaron Swartz was
disruptively trespassing on their systems - he was arrogantly and
obnoxiously aggressing against them.
And that, in fact, was what he was charged with, not with releasing
JSTOR IP property, but with screwing up other people's computers.
If he had been furtive about collecting the data, the way Snowden was,
there never would have been any problem.
The problem was that Aaron Swartz was an arrogant asshole who thought
he was ruling class and above the law, and that those he aggressed
against were menials beneath the law - the Henry Louis Gates
One of the things our ruling class filters against is conspicuous and
obnoxious arrogance.  They don't want us noticing them.  Aaron Swartz
failed the conspicuous arrogance filter before being granted tenure,
so suddenly found himself no longer ruling class.

If an ordinary person engages in physical intrusion to hack someone else's network, he is going to get in trouble.  Why is anyone shocked that Swartz got in trouble?
Why was Swartz shocked that he got in trouble?
This was not civil disobedience, it was the arrogance of ruling class mentality.  Swartz did not expect that his actions would have the consequences that they would have for an ordinary person.
Snowden, on the other hand, did.
As I am fond of remarking, Bill Ayers can bomb the Pentagon, but you cannot.  Swartz thought he was Bill Ayers.

No one gave a damn about Aaron Swartz leaking the docs.  That was not what he was charged with, and not what pissed off the sysadmins.  What pissed off the sysadmins was physical intrusion, and him bringing the network to its knees.

You are perhaps saying it frequently requires no skill, other than fraud or burglary, to muck up someone else's network.  Indeed it does not.
Nonetheless, mucking up someone else's network by such simple means is hacking in the first meaning of the word, hacking as an aggressive or criminal act.
Because hacking from a distance requires skill, particularly if a network has some halfway competent defenses, the word "hack" has also come to mean some impressively clever stuff done with computers, but the original meaning was simply bad stuff done by computer - and, in the early days of the internet, it was possible to do bad stuff by computer with very little skill.
And even today, it is possible to do bad stuff by computer with very little skill if one physically accesses a network that is not intended or expected to be accessed by outsiders.

Alinsky's tactics are the instrument of the overclass-underclass alliance, intended to be used by the overclass to manipulate the underclass.  I doubt that there are too many underclass on this list.

This claim requires more justification than I gave it.
Obviously Alinsky would never use language that demeans women or black people.  His language not only implies that women and blacks are equal to white males, but that they are more equal than black males.
And yet, somehow, strangely, when he gives concrete and specific examples of the use of his tactics, it is a white male doing the manipulation, and women, blacks, and poor people being manipulated.

"On Saturday, October 9, we again detected rapid downloading, this
time at an even faster rate. The downloading overloaded several
servers, disrupting access to JSTOR for users beyond MIT."
What led to his arrest was that he physically entered the building,
and physically entered the closet where their network was connected
up, and physically messed with their network wiring to attach his
laptop Burglary and physical damage.
Which physical damage led to network dysfunction.
Tracing the network failure, the sysadmins found his alterations to
their network, and left the laptop where it was, placing a camera near
the closet to detect the criminal's return to pick up the laptop.
In due course, Aaron Schwarz shows up on video picking up his laptop.
The sysadmins never displayed much interest in the fact that
he had earlier illegally downloaded huge numbers of articles.  They
got pissed, and he got charged, for entering the building and messing
with their wiring.
If he had kept his downloads non disruptive by limiting the download
rate, by being furtive as Edward Snowden was furtive, no one would
have bothered - and proof of this is that they did not bother.
He wanted to smack their faces with the fact that he was ruling class
and they were mere minions, that the laws of the ruling class are
for the little people, not for members of the ruling class.

Aaron Swartz was not charged downloading articles without paying, but
with disrupting a network on which his menial inferiors depended.
Illustrating that our masters are incompetent and stupid, as well as
If I had been in the closet and screwed with the network wiring (which
I would not have done since the network was wide open to competent
attack from safely far away) I would have screwed with the network
wiring in such a fashion as to produce no easily noticeable effects.
If I had been doing what Schwarz was doing, I would have proxied
through a bunch of zombies to disguise the IP, would have rate limited
the download so as not to stick out and not produce an obnoxious and
noticeable disruption, and would have done a pseudo random permutation
on the order so that it was not obvious sequential, thus not obvious
the intent was to download the entire database, so that it looked as
if particular specific articles were being downloaded.
And all that would have been overkill, for if no disruption of the
network, no one who had the skills to detect it and do something about
it would have cared.

Libertarians are propertarians.
Property rights are the boundaries between one man's plan and another man's plan.  If the ruling elite casually violate property rights, then, as with Obamacare, the result is chaos, which must be resolved by one plan imposed on all to restore order in order to avoid collapse. Terror follows in due course.  Should the terror ease, collapse follows.

The term hacker first appears 1975 - 1985, shortly after the start of the information epoch, the age of information starting by convention 1972 January first.
The term was originally an epithet, but not for criminal behavior:
At that time, 1980, a hacker was someone who programs for entertainment - badly.
In 1983,  a hacker is someone whose interest in programming has damaging consequences for his social life and social skills, but he is a very good programmer.
Then we hear that the original hacker was the phone phreak captain crunch, implying that a hacker is someone who breaks into other people's systems to take control of other people's stuff, generally to give himself free stuff.
"High noon on the electronic frontier", a 1996 book, talks about rehabilitating the term, and complains that "hacker" "carries the image of persons who are dangerous" (page 151)
So, evidently, the term was in need of rehabilitation.
In 1996, esr owns the term, and gives it a positive meaning.
So, hackers were something bad, then something criminal, and then, in 1996, we had a hacker pride movement, with esr as the key figure.
Hence, esr, for all his faults, is generally regarded as the prophet of the programming subculture.
But, before he was prophet, needed his people to be in bondage so that he could lead them out of bondage.

The reason Aaron Swartz was repeatedly detected and repeatedly blocked
was because of the crudity of his attack:(sequential downloads at
maximum  speed, disrupting JSTOR with excessive load)
Had he rate limited his downloads to avoid disrupting the network, and
hidden the sequential nature of his downloads through a random
permutation, he would have been fine.  No one competent to detect him
and block him would have cared enough to do so.

Aaron Swartz entered the closet where the networks were all wired up
together, and wired his laptop to the network, in the process bringing
JSTOR services to MIT a sudden grinding halt and adversely affecting
JSTOR services to the rest of the world.

MIT, however. made no real effort to identify the person responsible until he brought their network to a grinding halt.
Aaron Swartz was arrested for pissing off the sysadmins, and he pissed off the sysadmins by busting their wiring in their wiring closet.
The cause of his arrest, and the charges against him, were damaging interference with other people's physical property.

How do you think the horse became extinct in the Americas, the
mammoths, and all the rest?
Whites report that Indians, when they got the chance, killed a very
large number of buffalo and ate only the tongues.
The South American Indians had better technology than the North American Indians, and killed almost everything larger than a dog.  If the North American Indians had had metal, would have killed everthing larger than a rabbit.
Colonel Calloway, at the urging of Daniel Boone, purchased the south
side of the Kentucky River from the Indians.  They spent the money in
short order, and having spent the money, wanted the land back,
starting a war against the whites, a war against Daniel Boone and
Colonel Calloway, which turned out to be a really bad idea.
This was the general pattern, repeated over and over, with land
purchases leading to extraordinarily terrible Indian wars.  By and
large, Indian wars resulted from the short time preference of the
Indians relative to the longer time preference of the whites.  Indians
would make bad deals, a lot of land for a little whiskey, then after
the whites arrived and had created facts on the ground, the Indians
would change their minds, even though it was by then far too late to
change their minds.
If the Indians had had reasonable time preference, they would have
been able to hold out for a fair deal, and then stick to it.  Once
whites started to arrive, it was a really bad time for the Indians to
turn around and break the deal, but nonetheless it was usually the
Indians that broke the deal, usually by abducting children, sometimes
by scalping children and burning them alive.  Not only would they
break the deal, but break it at the worst time for themselves, in the
worst way for themselves, and in the most evil and horrible possible

One way accommodation, wherein men accommodate female differences, but females do not accommodate male differences, is dysfunctional, as demonstrated by Katherine Hultgreen, and also admits the inequality that it denies.
If you call it racism and sexism when characteristically male standards are upheld, this implicitly admits that women are different from men, and therefore in some activities and aspects inferior, while in others, the properly feminine sphere, superior.
If women are equal to men, then they deserve to be called out if they fail to live up to characteristically male standards.
If on the other hand, women are not equal to men, and require special treatment,  then they deserve a condescending pat on the head when they show up in male forums and need to be gently shepherded to a properly feminine environment, where they will not feel so out of place.   You are trying to have your cake and eat it as well, one way equality, wherein women are not only equal to men, but more equal than men.
If you call it racism and sexism when characteristically male standards are upheld, this has the unfortunate result that male behavior gets replaced by female behavior: Whereupon you get Katherine Hultgreen doing an Amelia Earhart.
If feminism is the principle that women are equal to men, cannot be the Katherine Hultgreen/Amelia Earhart principle that women get special treatment to accommodate their failings and weaknesses.
That path does not work.
Characteristically male environments are characteristically male because of characteristically male virtues.  Characteristically female environment are characteristically female because of characteristically female virtues.  If we are to have integration without social decay, then females entering a characteristically male environment need to live up to difficult, stressful, uncomfortable, and unfamiliar standards, as Katherine Hultgreen demonstrated in the most dramatic and terrible possible fashion, and Cari Matchet demonstrated in a more frivolous and amusing fashion.

In an effort to manufacture a poster girl, Hultgreen was required to attempt to land on an aircraft carrier, and in due course, killed herself, demonstrating why every naval pilot is male.
You can affirmative action women to all sorts of jobs, and furtively have a white male do the actual job, but the reason all naval pilots are males is that when you affirmative action someone to naval pilot and expect them to land on a carrier, they die.  There is room in an office for males to do the actual work, but there is no room in a warplane for a second pilot to do the actual piloting.
You can put girls in the army, and all that immediately happens is that the march slows down, but you cannot put girls in the naval airforce, and make the carriers bigger and the planes slower.  In a plane built for male abilities, landing on a ship built for male abilities, they have to fly like males.  And, of course, they cannot.  They tested her, in testing she repeated made errors that would have killed her.  She was the best female pilot available, so they had her do real landings regardless, so that they could have a poster girl.
Amelia Earhart was initially given a ticker tape parade and a meeting with the president for being flown across the Atlantic like a sack of potatoes by a male pilot, but the cognitive dissonance being too great, such a poster girl attracting ridicule, they eventually had Amelia Earhart and Kara Hultgreen attempt to perform difficult piloting tasks for real, killing them.
In due course we will have female naval pilots with same uniforms as male pilots.  The unisex uniforms will be made girly.  The traditions will be made girlie or abolished.  Male camraderie will be forbidden. References to nuts and bolts will be forbidden as excessively sexist. But the female naval pilots will not actually be required to fly carrier

The reason they would not let her pilot the plane on the flight for which she got the ticker tape parade is that she could not safely pilot the plane for which she got the ticker tape parade.  That they would not let her fly it, despite extreme pressure to do so, suggests that if the had let her fly it, she would have gotten killed all the faster.
If unsafe to let her fly one plane, unsafe to let her fly another very similar plane.
They have been looking for a female pilot for the navy ever since they had aircraft carriers.  In all these years, could not find one, so, under ever increasing pressure to include women, decided to go with Kara Hultgreen, because she was the best, which is to say the least bad they could find.
PC killed Amelia Earhart, and PC killed Kara Hultgreen.
Similarly, successful businesses stuff all their female executives into HR, keeping them away from decisions that could screw up the business.
In due course, we will have non flying navy pilots with same uniforms and honors as flying navy pilots, and all the female pilots will be non flying.  All the naval pilots that actually fly will be given girly uniforms.  Emasculation will be required in order to provide a more female friendly environment for the non flying pilots.

Compare photos of men of 1950, with photos of men today.  We *are*
being forcibly feminized.  It is unpleasant, distressing, humiliating,
degrading, and contrary to our natures.  Either that, or something in
the water is making testosterone levels and sperm counts drop like a
stone.  You might blame evil pollution by evil capitalists rather than
forced feminization, but undeniably something really bad is happening.
And the fact that no one is paying attention suggests that the problem is forced feminization rather than some mystery pollutant.  If it was likely that it is plastic softeners in the drinking water, we would have more official scientists making a officially big deal about it than about global warming.

The Blue empire is in a state of not quite peace and proxy war with the red empire.  If the blue empire wants to suppress Bitcoin, it will not trust the red empire to do it.  The Red empire probably will not want to suppress bitcoin.
We are seeing a similar disagreement between the red empire and the blue empire on "asylum seekers" - code word for colored illegal immigrants headed to white countries other than North America.
The reason the blue empire is destroying the morale and cohesion of the US military forces is that it is more afraid of those forces than it is of external enemies.
As I said before, there are too many people in the ruling elite, and they do not like or trust each other.

Suppose the political elite are not in agreement - and they are
finding it harder and harder to get agreement.  They tell their
footsoldiers to implement the policy, and tell their footsoldiers to
not implement the policy - and suddenly the footsoldiers are
kingmakers, making the ruling elite nervous.
This is already happening with "asylum seekers".

Corporations are people.
If you grant lesser rights to corporations than to natural people, then the state can, and will, make corporations fire anyone suspected of thinking politically incorrect thoughts.
Turned on the news last night, they were interviewing some silicon valley people, and the interviewer asked about how corporations viewed this and that.  One of the interviewees replied "I am a corporation". He complained that he was subject to secret orders by a secret court, which lawless orders he could not tell anyone about, that he himself was being spied upon, that as well as being required to turn over information officially, his information was being stolen unofficially, and that foreign customers had (correctly) come to distrust him.
A corporation is freedom of association, a group of people that agree together to act as one.
In order to act as one, they delegate complete power over the collective assets of the project to one of themselves, the CEO, who is, often one of the major shareholders.  Thus a corporation is people, people agreeing to associate, and corporation is a person, in that the people agreeing to associate commonly nominate one of themselves to be that person.

That is backwards from reality.  People that corporations consist of
lose these rights, such as freedom of speech, because the government
violates the rights of the corporation.

For example, Pax Dickinson was fired for crimethink
The person who called for his firing was Anil, who holds regulatory
government powers over the company that employed Pax Dickinson.
      I was pretty amazed that he went for it. He flat out said that he
      wants his startup to be funded and wasn’t sure if it’d be
      possible after all of his, and I replied that it realistically
      wasn’t going to happen without the say-so of someone like me, and
      I wasn’t inclined to give some VC the nod on this.
So, these days, the merely wealthy need a nod from the likes of Anil,
the powerless need to run all their decisions past the powerful.

Each node of the tree contains the sum of the value of all tokens under that node. Further you check the validity of each branch of the tree on which your tokens appear.  So total number of tokens issued is correct.
Each unblinded token cashed is added into the Merkle tree.  If not in tree, could be recashed.  So total number tokens paid out on is correct.
