@_subject: feinstein and domestic crypto curbs 
here's the text of a letter that i snail-mailed to california's
senator dianne feinstein in early september:
  here's feinstein's reply, which i received a couple of days
ago.  i've transcribed it pretty carefully, and left the typos
intact with [sic], any other typos are mine:
  nothing terribly surprising, really -- i wasn't expecting any
response at all, though

A Solothurn, natch.  For those who don't know:  A circa 1938 20mm

screw around?  :-)

@_subject: Why I Support Microsoft 
i haven't touched unix or linux in a long time, but i submit that
your ordinary GS-4 secretary can deal with microsoft word a lot more
efficiently than s/he can deal with vi/emacs/latex.  i assume there are
better tools available on *ix platforms these days, which actually
destroys my argument:
  do you really want the government to be more efficient?  :-)

you can duplicate a CD for about $2, in half an hour
  i've already encountered some copy-protected software (the CD
duplicates don't work).  my guess is we'll see a lot more of this
  check out the "warez" newsgroups...

@_subject: Driver Licenses and agreeing to something 
this can work two ways... especially if the people you're trying
to work are not paying attention
  a friend of mine recently had his state license renewed.  i think
they have the procedure for doing fingerprints down pretty much so they
are inescapable if you want a new D/L, buuut...
  one of the things they make you sign at the bottom of the form is
an agreement that starts out "I agree to...".  my friend ran the form
through a scanner, changed "agree" to "disagree" and printed out his
own version of the form.  he handed it in and naturally the pencil-
pushers never gave it a second glance

well, no matter wh'appens, microsoft is going to come out of
this smelling like a rose
  putting on my favorite cryptoparanoia hat, over the next five years:
   o	MS gets what it wants -- more regulation, forcing it to stop
   o	intel gets what it wants: no clones.  if you want to run linux
   o	the government gets what it wants, because the crypto hooks
  i haven't figured out how the communications infrastructure is going
to be noodled.  maybe it doesn't have to be.  expect ipsec to die a
long, slow death -- a delaying tactic, the best kind for the feds,
because it prevents any sucessors from getting up a head of steam.  [i
don't know beans about the current status of ipsec]
  long about 2020 or so it'll be a federal offense to own an EPROM
burner, a processor with re-flashed microcode, an unlicensed logic
analyzer, or a copy of linux... :-)
  [stay tuned for a short story about the freedom fighters of 2025,
   hacking secure communications on copies of the last architectures
   known not to be compromised ("daddy, what's a PDP-10?"), running ITS
   on souped-up gigahertz pocket portables, getting packets through on
   covert channels involving the coat-tails of the (now ubiquitous) KRAP
   session key negotiations...]

@_subject: NT 5.0 and EFS -- A victory for widespread use of crypto? 
you're asking the *cypherpunks list* if anyone has
an opinion?  oh, gad...  :-)
  excerpted (without permission) from the latest issue of the
microsoft systems journal, about the new feature of NTFS in
NT 5.0, specifically regarding encryption:
  "...NTFS has built-in recovery support so that the encrypted
   data can be accessed.  In fact, NTFS won't allow files to be
   encrypted unless the system is configured to have at least
   one recovery key.  For a domain environment, the recovery keys
   are defined at the domain controller and are enforced on all
   machines within the domain...."
  i'll definitely have to play with this one -- wh'appens if you add
a machine to a domain, encrypt some files, then remove the machine
from the domain?  can the admin of the domain recover all files
you encrypt from that point on?  and so on...
  "...For home users, NTFS automatically generates recovery keys
   and saves them as machine keys.  You can then use command-line
   tools to recover data from an administrator's account."
  if i were looking for a point of attack, i'd start with the
low-level key management here...
  another interesting thing to try: install NT on a workstation,
encrypt a removable disk, then reinstall NT on that workstation
again -- have you defeated key recovery for that disk?  (since the
machine keys for the first install of NT are presumably gone...)
