[Note: I have an interest, since QuizID use nCipher hardware]
Their device has a neat way of synchronizing the sequence number to the server which both avoids the clock drift problems that trouble RSA SecurID and mean that you'd have to get the user to pass you a large number of codes before you got them out of sync with the server.  It also helps them avoid some of RSA's later patents which deal with their troublesome clock sync problems.

This is basically correct.  FileVault uses an auto-mounting version of
the encrypted disk image facility that was in 10.2, tweaked to allow
the image to be opened even before your main key chain is available
(since the key chain is stored inside your home directory).  The
standard encrypted image format uses a random key stored on your key
chain, which is itself encrypted with a salted and hashed copy of the
keychain pass phrase, which defaults to your login password.  My
suspicion is that for the FileVault there is some other key chain file
in the system folder which stores the key for decrypting your home
directory disk image and that the pass phrase for that is just your
login password.
Yup, it essentially does an "hdiutil compact" command when you log out.
I believe that it uses counter mode, since it's efficient when doing
random access to the encrypted data.
