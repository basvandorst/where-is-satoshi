Boy, do I feel like an idiot.
Since I wrote the above, the Province of Nova Scotia shut down Cole
Harbor school for a week to install surveillance cameras, and now
they have armed policemen patrolling the highways.
Although the body-searches have shown that the students are not carrying weapons, it turns out they are also not wearing any panties.
