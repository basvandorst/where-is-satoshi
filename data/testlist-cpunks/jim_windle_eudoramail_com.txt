This weeks New York Times Sunday magazine has an article about "space war".  With some interesting comments regarding surveillance, GPS, ASAT and NMD as well as the following line from an Air Force colonel which seems very indicative of the current thinking in Washington:

@_subject: Linux On Steroids: DIY supercomputer software from Sandia 
The idea has been around and so has software and not just from Sandia.  The Scyld cluster software costs $2 for non-commercial use and is widely used.  The technology is advancing very quickly, for instance Avalon at LANL came in 113 on the Top500 in 11/98 at 48 gigaflops.  Systems with say 64 Athlon processors and doing roughly 75-80 gigaflops are available pre-built or can be and are constructed by a wide variety of universities and corporations (check out the Beowulf list to get an idea of the range of applications and the number of large clusters out there).  There are many application of cypherpunk-interest for this sort of cheap computing power.  Unfortunately crypto probably isn't one of them.  It is far easier to increase the size of the key than to scale up the processing power in a meaningful way.  Until far more efficient factoring algorithms are found the math will insure this remains the case.
The technology is potentially revolutionary in many areas of interest to cypherpunks but factoring large numbers is so hard and it is so easy to increase the size of keys that crypto will easily stay ahead of the Beowulf technology.  Now if someone had a working quantum computer that might be a different story.

My current favorite, which I noticed on my hand held hair dryer recently warns among other things not to use the dryer while bathing.  It seems to me that the manufacturer should be liable for the damages to the rest of us caused by any person who is prevented from removing him or herself from the gene pool by using a blow dryer while bathing.  This should also apply to that persons descendants.  Triple damages if that person or any descendant is elected to any legislative body.

The list of other influential non-lawyers might also be expanded to include Turing, Godel, von Braun, Crick and Watson.

Yes, I recognise that you were naming only the giants in a particular, though higly importnat field, who also had interest in "policy".  My point was simply that certain ideas are so pwerful that their authors have influence on events whether or not they seek it.  And that Washington policy makers must come to terms with those idea, whether or not they like.

I think Tim's point was simply that Sealand's location is too far north to be a good launch site.  To put a useful satellite in an orbit with a useful footprint for this purpose from a launch site so far north would require a lot lift capacity eliminating small launch systems, raising the issue of Sealand's ability to support the launch infrastructure.  It would probably also mean launching to the east over highly populated areas in the EC which would probably object to the launch as well.

Yes, Boeing is a partner, as is Kraevner a Norweigan company that supplied a refurbished semisubmersible drilling rig.  They use Russian Zenit rockets which are loaded on the platform in Long Beach then the launch platform and command and support ships move to equatorial waters for the launch.  And you're absolutely right, SeaLand can't support that sort of operation, nor does it provide an equatorial launch site.

Thanks it been a long time since I even seemed sophisticated to anyone.  What is not irrelevant to the discussion is, ignoring any range safety problems, is physics.  Ignoring the influence of the moon, a satellite orbit is a 2 body problems which is completely specified when its initial conditions (6 scalars for things like velocity and position) are specified at a particular time.  When you grind through all the math you discover an interesting condition.  No launch site can directly insert a satellite into an orbit with an orbital inclination less than it latitude.  (This is why we put our main launch facility in Florida, why the ESA picked Guyana and the Russian moved to Tyrutam from Pletesck and still had to use such big rockets because its still a high latitude) An orbit with 50+ degrees of inclination is not going to visible over areas like North America or Western Europe regularly enough to be of much use for a crypto system.  To put it into a useful orbit an orbital!
 t!
ransfer maneuver would be necessary, this requires an additional stage for the rocket.  I am aware of the type rocket you are talking about, and launched from an equatorial area they might work, but at 52 degrees of latitude they would have to be able to launch not only the satellite but an additional stage to perform the orbital transfer.  This would require not only a pretty capable rocket and a sophisticated control system as well for orbital transfer maneuvering. Even if an amateur system could do this it starts getting very expensive.  Hence my contntion that Sealand, even without issues of range safety, is not a very good launch site.

There is lots of junk up there.  Schemes to de-orbit satellites at the end of their useful life have been put forward but they always fail on the liability issue.  Apparently if a satellite falls out of orbit it is an "act of god" and the owner/insurer is not responsible for damages, but if the satellite is deliberately de-orbitted the owner/insurer is on the hook.  No one, partiucularly the insurance companies wants to try it.  This despite a high degree of confidence in being able to bring a satellite down in a hopefully empty patch of ocean.  Insurance companies are very risk averse.

Yes they were.  I think Iridium is something of a special case.  It was in bankruptcy and any damage claim would probably have been classified as a general unsecured claim and not likely to recover anything.  The ability to go after Motorola is limited.  Some of the subordinated debt still trades, in the low single digits last time I checked, on the theory they may get a recovery from Motorola in a lawsuit.  Also to preserve the value of the estate, or in this case not to further increase expenses a judge could overrule an insurance company objection.  I didn't follow the Iridium proceeding that closely so I don't remember the details.
I recently read, and will look for the citiation, a proposal for an extendable tether which would be used to de-orbit satellites after their maneuvering fuel was used up.  Apparently the insurance companies have shot it down for the "act of god" reason.  The satellite operators could apparently use a controlled burn to bring it down with enough safety margin for some insurance companies to be comfortable but the fuel requirements are apparently substantial and appreciably shorten the satellite's life.  Hence they choose to leave them up as junk rather than incur the costs necessary to bring them down in a fashion acceptable to the insurer who are on the hook if a controlled de-orbit hits something.  Obviously in the case of Iridium the remaining life of the satellites was not a valuable asset until the buyer came forward.

Apparently there was an unanticipated meteor shower last evening visible from New York to Virginia.  According to the story on Yahoo:
"A Reuters reporter saw a tapered object shaped like a trumpet bell falling diagonally through the western sky near West Chester, Pennsylvania, 20 miles from Philadelphia at about 6:20.  The object emitted a lustrous rainbow of colors ranging from bright yellow on its downward-pointing flared end to light green and finally rust-colored red at the upward pointing tapered end."

One of the interesting ideas, though only relevant for the downtown areas fo big cities, is to use the zoning regulations to get 802.11b access included as one of the "public improvements" required in return for an easement allowing a taller (any other violation of the zoning code would work as well) than would otherwise be allowed.  This is to say nothing of access points set up by individuals allowing broadband access to others, there are already 2 of those in my neighborhood.

By agreement among some of the local groups around the country this site is supposed to act as a clearing house for the different groups.  It has a fairly good section with AP maps for different areas.

In 1801 Thomas Jefferson said:
"Considering the general tendency to multiply offices and dependencies, and to increase expense to the ultimate term of burden which the citizen can bear, it behooves us to avail ourselves of every occasion which presents itself for taking off the surcharge; that it never may be seen here that, after leaving to labor the smallest portion of it earnings on which it can subsist, government shall itself consume the residue or what it was instituted to guard."

One more bit of debunking.  According to the EIA the US uses on average over 8 million barrels of gasoline a day.  The petroleum industry defines a barrel as 42 gallons.  That's 336 million gallons a day or 123 billion gallons a year.  If each gallon is subsidized by $10+ per barrel, the annual sudsidy from the government to the oil industry would be, at a minimum, $1.23 trillion a year.  Total GDP in 2000 was only $9.2 trillion.  This is non-sense.  Or is this subsidy desquised as the defense budget, social security payments and service on the national debt?

I think "common carrier" status was orignally conceived to allow access by all to an asset which is a "natural monopoly". Thus the owner of the monopoly, in return for having it sanctioned by the government,is required to do business with all.  He is not held liable for certain results because he is required to forego normal business judgement about with whom to do business.  As remailers are not in any sense a "natural mononoply" the common carrier rational for not holding the remailer liable for the results of doing business with particular parties would not apply.  Nor for that matter would the monopoly grounds for the government regulation of remailers exist.  Though I supppose the government has expanded the concept of common carrier to expand its regulatory grasp I don't think it could be expanded so far as to include remailers, but I don't know current case law on this question.   Agreed, its hard to imagine a grounds for government regulation here that doesn't infringe on the first amendment.
Of course when it comes to defining concepts from economics and law I defer to Faustine and Aimee.  Unfortunately they seem, like cops, to never be around when you need them.

@_subject: From Manhattan 
I am in Manhattan.  I can see a massive smoke plume from the roof of my building but the Met Life (formerly PanAm) building blocks my view of the World Trade Center itself.  The smoke is also visible at street level down the avenues.  Even uptown  there is considerable emergency vehicle traffic headed in a generally downtown direction.  Phone service is working but the system must be deluged as it is sometimes difficult to get a dial tone.  The TV transmitters for NYC are on top of one of the towers so those are gone but I assume the cable feeds are still OK.  The bridges and tunnels to NJ have been closed, the subway is also closed until further notice.  The airports are closed to outgoing flights.  Apparently police perimeters are being set up around the UN and other remaining potential targets.  The stock exchanges and futures exchanges are all closed.  The primary election scheduled for today has been postponed.  The World Trade Center normally has 40,00-50,000 people wo!
rking in it so casualties are likely to be very high, particularly as the upper floors of both buildings have now collapsed.  The mood here is obviously tense but people are still going about their business.  I have noticed a few people looking up when they hear a plane overhead.  There is considerable anger as well as universal willingness to help out if possible.  While Manhattan is physically cut off pretty completely there is no rush that I can see to get out (stranded commuters are resigned to spending the night most likely in hotels or with friends), nor any expectation of further strikes, though obviously the police are taking numerous precautions.  All things considered it seem surprising normal, except for the visible smoke and extra high siren level, though tense, here, but of course I am uptown someone closer to the scene will no doubt have a different experience.

I have been out trying to give blood.  At this point all hospitals and blood donation centers have been inundated with volunteers and are only taking Types O+ and O- which are the universal donor types.  Anyone in the area with those types should try to donate today.  They are asking the rest of us to come back tomorrow or later in the week as they expect the need for blood to be protracted.  All the subways were closed but are now running again as are the city buses, the bridges and tunnels are still closed to non-pedestrian traffic I hear.  Most businesses have closed for the day and sent people home who are all walking on the street.  Banks, drugstores and grocery stores are still open, and busy.  Passing the &th regiment armory on Park Ave, the national guard are reporting apparently to help in cordoning off and cleaning up the WTC area.  I also stopped at the grocery store on my way home, it was crowded, a bit more than the last blizzard, but there are still items on the shelves.  There is a small amount of non-official traffic, but a number of streets are closed off.  I did however see a couple of lage cranes headed downtown.  Some street with power sub-station or telephone switching facilityes are closed off and barracaded with NYC garbage trucks or Dept. of Transportation concrete mixer trucks.  There are a handful of F-15's circling over Manhattan, the r!
est of the normal overhead air traffic is nonexistent at the moment.  Police and police auxilary are out directing traffic at major intersections, manning barricades and walking about answering questions.  I have not been south of mid-town so I can't speak of lower Manhattan where the attack was but here there has been no "panic".  The sidewalks are very crowded, people are somber and tense but don't seem to anticipate anything else here in the city and ae quite willing to help if possible.  The lines at both the Manhattan Blood center and at Lennox Hill Hospital were around the block with people waiting to donate blood.
The plume of smoke is still rising and plainly visible from any rooftop and at ground level looking down the avenues.  So far the infrastructure of the City seems to be handling things.  The broadcast tower at the WTC is gone so some broadcast TV and radio are out, but other local stations are still on the air and the cable feed appears unaffected.  The subways are not running but were apparently shut down for fear of a terrorist act.  The subway line does not run through the WTC anyway.  The PATH train to NJ does however.  It is apparently out but how badly or if at all the tunnels were damaged I cannot say.  All the financial markets are closed, it is not clear when the stock exchange will reopen, I have heard a rumor it may close for the week.  It is not close enough I think to have been damaged but it seems that all downtown is shut off and will be for some time until the the fire is under control and the area has been cleaned up, that could be a while.  Phone and intern!
et service is still up though the network is burdened, earlier today I had some difficulty getting a dial tone but not now.  Obviously the City has been the target of a major terrorist attack, but except for a few people fleeing immediately after the attack I have heard of no one leaving. The official response seems to have been very efficient in terms of deploying to protect other potential target, particularly the city's infrastructure.  I cannot speak of the response at the WTC not having been there but it seems they have called in everyone and everything that can possibly be of use in the situation though with an attack of this magnitude that still may not be enough.

I agree completely that the real issue will be economics.  Though, as I remeber, like most Manhattanites I try to tune "the Donald" out when he started spouting, the issue wil Trumps proposal to build the world's tallest building in the old railroad yards he is developing on the West Side was not the economics of the building, which he thought worked, but rather his inability to get the necessary zoning approvals.
Another developer, Silvestein, had a 99 year lease on the WTC while the Port Authority continued to own the property.  Siverstien has already called for the site to be redeveloped, though what if any rights he enjoys to do so under the 99 year lease on now non-existent buildings I don't know.  As Trump seems at the moment at least to be syclically solvent I am sure he will make a high profile proposal to redevelop the site as well.
