@_subject: REMAIL: cypherpunks strategy 
How does everyone else feel about the idea of maintaining multiple accounts as a method of maintaining pseudo-anonymity?  I commonly use two accounts on each of my systems, one by my real name, one by my alias, which is the same everywhere.  The purpose of this is to allow me to send or recieve mail to/from people who I know from other bbs's and such and relay information in that way without giving them my real name.  as greg pointed out, it's very easy to have multiple accounts; some of us run sites that give us the ability to create pseudo-users, and pseudo-sites for that matter, and others can make use of public bbs's with net access. I know of a few bbs's in my area (silicon valley) that offer net access and don't do any sort of validation, making it very simple to set up and maintain multiple accounts.  How do people feel about doing something like this rather than using remailers since it seems that a lot of problems come up when people run remailers and start getting complaints?

I agree.. what if he posted it as some silly program in one of the sources groups, encrypted and all, with a description as something almost no one would want? then the worst that would happen is people flaming him for encrypting it.. that would be a way to go for a real post to convey information.. we could always create an alt.too.many.secrets (obligatory documentary movie reference =]) to post things to where there is a large audience, but for an audience of people who care about such issues, as opposed to a normal post which joe random user could argue with everyone without knowing the difference between a pgp encrypted and uuencoded the other issue is that people will think what they want to think if they're uninformed, such as all of the people who flamed Tim for posting what's basically a worthless message, just that those people who flamed him didn't like the name of the group he posted it in.. for all we know, he could've posted his local /etc/hosts.

@_subject: What do you make of this? 
I dont know about all of them, but the second one is near me and I confirmed that there is no 244 prefix in the 510 area code, so either ther is an error in that data, or should I venture so far as to say that he's trying to make a point about hiding information in a seemingly harmless format.  I don't have the desire to actually try to find out what it is, but it wouldnt take much more research to find out if the list is primarily made of nonexistent numbers.  However, the only reason I
even looked that far is because of the nature of this group and the fact that
it was brought up as such, rather than "Local U.S. Department of Agriculture
offices" or some other title that would cause people to want to be as far
away from it as possible.

@_subject: encrypted email software 
People first thought there was a back door because they wouldn't release enough info on the algorithm to give people a chance to see if they trusted it or not.  After it was all common knowledge, people examined it and came to the conclusion that it was secure, though questions are still around about why it was changed from 64 bit to 56 bit, which is also why it is believed that the NSA has computers that can break it by brute force in a reasonable amount of time, but nevertheless it is a brute force attack.
That's how I've heard (from various sources) the whole story with DES goes, and it seems like a reasonable one.

@_subject: xor data hiding? 
in this case, you're just trying to garble what people see so why not just xor "hello, world." /bin/csh or \command.com on top of it to avhieve that result.  No need for anything significant, I mean, if you xor 'X' over the whole thing, you've achieved the same result - after all, if someone wants to xor 'X' to knock that level of encryption(if I may call simple substitution "encryption") then it's fair to assume that the person knows it's cyphertext and they want the information below it, so that's a good place to use some decent encryption.. "congratulations, you have found the secret message. send the answer to old pink care of the funny farm" (Pink Floyd, The Wall (backmasking)) is what readily comes to mind when i see what you're getting at.. after all, searching a disk for data that fits specific patterns is one thing, figuring out that one of the index files for a database program with literally hundreds of database files and indecies (I used to work on programming such a database, so I know they exist and that they are a perfect hiding place for just about everything) is actually an encrypted file isn't a walk in the park.  anyway, enough babbling - hope some of it makes sense. =)

@_subject: problems with key escrow? 
I was thinking about the problems that people have with escrowed keys and was wondering a few things.  For one, things like the clipper chip would not give law enforcement agencies any new abilities or powers - they are currently allowed to tap a phone conversation iff they have a court order to do so.  escrowed clipper keys would only be revealed if a court had decided that there was enough evidence against someone to justify a wiretap (and the accompanying keys).  so these could only be revealed in the case of criminal activity (or reasonable suspicion thereof), which means that most people wouldn't have anything to worry about.  now, is the real problem that the key escrow agency is the weakest link in the chain of security? that people don't trust the government having these things since they could quietly copy the database to the nsa? what about the possibility of having some organization like, but not necessarily the eff hold onto keys so that they would reveal them, or better, decrypt only in the case of a court order, but they would also make it publicly known if the nsa tried to claim they had an inherent right to all of the I haven't really thought too much about this one way or the other, but I thought it would be worthwhile to get some others' opinions.

@_subject: TC May advertises cypherpunks as keeping your taxes from going to 
this is a good example of why we need pgp signatures on messages.  I would tend to not believe either of of them without confirming them.  After all, any post that involves a "Detweiler may be right" idea, regardless of the context, is certainly not something most people would say.  And the other post just seems to be odd - someone who, for all intents and purposes, tends to have a functional brain, claiming that the government takes from him to give to "people of color" is overlooking the fact that the government will give money to anyone who labels themself as "disadvantaged" regardless of race, religion, favorite flavor of ice cream, etc.  Anyway, who are any of us to speak of nationalities anyway? dont we all look the same, ie. user at site.domain? I havent seen anyone start using white-user at site.domain, black-user at site.domain, asian-user at site.domain, etc.  Anyway, what do other people's motives matter anyway? this list is for cryptography last I checked.  And for every person who chooses to use it in a bad(pick a context) way, there is probably someone who wants to use it in a good(pick a context) way.
anyway, enough ranting and raving.  does the fact that I posted (a rarety) now qualify me for membership in the hidden-agenda tentacle club? Mike Sherwood

@_subject: clipper==bad, but how do you explain this to average joe 6-pack? 
How do we go about explaining why clipper is bad to average joe 6-pack?  I've noticed that most normal people seem to think the reasons against clipper are just paranoid concerns of a bunch of conspiracy theorists.  Average joe 6-pack doesn't seem concerned that the government will have the keys to decrypt anything he does using a cellular phone with a clipper chip.  Or in the key database were compromised, such things could be forged, but that's what average joe 6-pack sees as being the imaginations of a bunch of conspiracy theorists in action.  How can this be explained to people who have a hard time differentiating a 5.25" floppy from a small paper plate? (Well, they couldn't do it 2 out of 3 If we can't effectively convince the average citizens that clipper is bad, they'll accept it because the government told them it is good and alternative crypto is bad because the only reason to hide something from our benevolent, democratic government(which is always acting in our best interests) is if we're hideous criminals.
Any comments would be appreciated.

@_subject: clipper==bad, but how do you explain this to average joe 6-pack? 
I also oppose the whole clipper/key escrow idea just because it's the governments' idea.  The reason that makes it bad is because they have a lot more power to "promote" their "good ideas" whereas those of us out here have the option to choose if we're happy with des or if we'd prefer pgp.  However, this is more of a religious issue than anything else, and the average people don't understand serious religious issues - they're too caught up on the silly ones that no one cares about like creation vs evolution. =)
well, the cops can do that anyway with their magic door-breaking key.  And as we've seen in the case of steve jackson games, they'd much rather break things apart than let people give them keys to open them. =)
this applies to crypto in general.  clipper gives this protection from everyone *BUT* law enforcement.  how do we justify "hiding" everything from the police without giving the inference that what we want to keep private is illegal or highly questionable?  I've found a lot of people more willing to assume the government's intentions are good than to accept that individuals are.
any thoughts on an approach for bringing this to the attention of those people at the gym that don't care about crypto? or perhaps a speech to a captive audience that has to listen because it's a public speaking class that is part of silly required GE? =)

@_subject: Need info on Encyption book 
If this is the one I'm thinking of, with source in basic, the algorithms used are mostly primitive things that have been cracked a long time ago.  while it may be useful as a text for someone who isn't at all familiar with cryptography to start with, don't be fooled by claims that simple xor is a strong encryption algorithm.  I dont think the book covers any serious encryption algorithms (des, idea, public key crypto, etc) but the most memorable thing about it was that it was funny that they believed what they were saying, so my memory may be faulty.

@_subject: Digital Cash 
Graham's point is still valid here.  cryptography is a matter of fairly complex mathematics - this is not a trivial thing to attack.  I know from experience many ways of getting around the various forms of copy protection used on software, and most of it is just a matter of comparing a legitimate run with an illegitimate run.  to oversimplify, there is often a point in a program that branches on a test condition and in many cases, all that needs to be done is to find these and change a a branch if equal instruction to branch if not equal, so that the program depends on *not* satisfying the parameters of the copy protection.  likewise, on serialized software, it's often fairly easy to figure out the pattern and change the serial number without figuring out the way it's encrypted by the program.  anyway, I digress, the purpose of this list is data encryption, not to teach people how to beak copy protection.  the only potential harm that could be done by these people is to weaken the programs we use for encryption, but there is not much of a point to doing Mike Sherwood
