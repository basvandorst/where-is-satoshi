@_subject: Is Rush Limbaugh giving Clinton sh*t about wiretap chip? 
G. Gordon Liddy, "Radio Free DC" can be reached at:
Vox: 1-800-GGLIDDY
Fax: 1-800-937GFAX
I'm going to go wash my hands now. With lots of soap.
My guess would be that Liddy and Limbaugh would both be very
happy about the Tapper chip proposal, and would recognize us
as natural enemies. Try 'em if you want, but be wary.

@_subject: CSPAN NOT covering the hearings tommorrow 
C-SPAN is not tax supported, if that's what you meant. Presumably
transcripts will be available from the GPO as part of the Congressional
Record, or someone in Ma who is a Markey constituent could get them
for free and post a summary.

In particular, Compuserve subscribers get 15-minute old stock
quotes for free, and pay extra to get closer to real-time.
To quote an advert from Open Systems (Propaganda) Today:
"            SuperHackers
D.E. Shaw & Co., a small, ... algorithmic trading firm,
seeks brilliant, world-class software professionals to
help create Wall Street's future. ..."
This may be drifting off-topic, unless someone sees a way to finance
anarcho-ventures with high-tech arbitrage. I suppose Perry would be in
the middle of any such cabal -- or maybe he isn't saying ;-)

More precedent: DG Eclipses have a COB (COunt Bits) instruction.
Interestingly enough, there seems to be no such instruction in the
VAX (This from R'ingTFM. I have pitifully little VAX experience.)

"Most would agree"? What a silly statement. You're in a big virtual
room with lots of different people, but a lot of them are "card-carrying"
libertarians who most certainly don't agree with that.
However, Marc also said, "I am glad that someone is finally mentioning
[the parallel between crypto and arms]." which is vacuous in light of
the _endless_ discussion on this very point on Usenet (sci.crypt and
elsewhere) in the beginnings of the wiretap chip flap.
Which leads me to my main point: please take this off-list before it
turns into the same flamewar that currently rages on
talk.politics.guns and for whatever weird reason, sci.skeptic.
