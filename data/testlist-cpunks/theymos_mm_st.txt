- BitcoinMiner processes transactions in priority order based on age of dependencies
- make sure generation doesn't start before block 74000 downloaded
- bugfixes by Dean Gores

Fixes not mentioned below:
- Due to a problem in GetMyExternalIP, it was taking 5-10 extra minutes
  to connect to the network.
- Efficiency in transaction processing while generating has been improved,
  which will reduce wasted CPU usage, especially for generators using
  several GPUs/CPUs. Some heavy GPU miners might have found themselves
  bound by CPU power.
0.3.16 (SVN revision 189) was never officially released.
Version 0.3.17 is now available.
- new getwork, thanks m0mchil
- added transaction fee setting in UI options menu
- free transaction limits
- sendtoaddress returns transaction id instead of "sent"
- getaccountaddress The UI transaction fee setting was easy since it was still there from
0.1.5 and all I had to do was re-enable it.
The accounts-based commands: move, sendfrom and getbalance will be in the next release.  We still have some more changes to
make first.

Now you only have to back up after every 100 sends, new addresses, generations, or transactions received by IP address.

@_subject: [bitcoin-list] Bitcoin 0.3.12 is released 
Someone on IRC said that they'd like to be notified of new versions through a mailing list, so I thought I'd start reposting Satoshi's version announcements here. Hopefully no one finds this annoying...
Version 0.3.12 is now available.
- json-rpc errors return a more standard error object. (thanks to Gavin Andresen)
- json-rpc command line returns exit codes.
- json-rpc "backupwallet" command.
- Recovers and continues if an exception is caused by a message you received.  Other nodes shouldn't be able to cause an exception, and it hasn't happened before, but if a way is found to cause an exception, this would keep it from being used to stop network nodes.
If you have json-rpc code that checks the contents of the error string, you need to change it to expect error objects of the form {"code":,"message":}, which is the standard.  See this thread:
