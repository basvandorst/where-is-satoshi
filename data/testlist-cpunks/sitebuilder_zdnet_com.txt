@_subject: A Special Note for the Builder Buzz Community 
Dear Builder Buzz Members:
As you know, Builder.com has undergone a major redesign in the past month.  And you've probably noticed that Builder.com's discussions have moved to a new message board system (and we've stopped accepting new registrations for Builder Buzz).
We've received many requests to keep the Builder Buzz message boards open in addition to our new discussions on Builder.com.  And we definitely want keep Builder Buzz online, since it's been one of the strongest, most vibrant communities in the history of CNET forums. However in order to cover the costs of continuing to maintain and support Builder Buzz, it's necessary for us to incorporate it into CNET's Quick SiteBuilder ( a paid Web hosting & e-learning service. So as of today, you can only access the original Builder Buzz message boards and CNET Quick SiteBuilder, complete with Web hosting, advanced site administration tools, and more -- for just $8.95 a month.  You can also try the service for 30 days for free (see details below).
We understand that this isn't the perfect answer, but the alternative was to close Builder Buzz down and lose everything we've created there. As you're probably well aware, many Web sites are experimenting with a mixture of free and paid content.  We will always keep the existing Builder.com content free (including the new message boards) and those who wish to remain on Builder Buzz can elect to join our SiteBuilder service. We hope you'll continue with Builder Buzz and give Quick SiteBuilder a try -- it's a great place for simple or advanced Web production, and includes a complete set of online tools for doing quick sketches and mockups, as well as advanced tools, online reference material and full FTP access.
