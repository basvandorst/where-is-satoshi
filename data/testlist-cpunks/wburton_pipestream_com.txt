@_subject: PGP Disk for free?? 
They feel guilty 'cause there was a flaw in previous versions of PGP
Disk.  It's a gesture of good will.
The source for 5.x is freely available, and I expect the source for (at
least the free versions of) 6.x will soon be.  Now, as far as I'm aware,
the source for PGP Disk is not yet available, and probably won't be,
since that's a commercial product.  Not that that's a GOOD reason ;).
Bingo.  Perhaps they'll give you a refund!
Not I.  That would take some serious equipment!  I doubt even Phil
Zimmerman or Network Associates has tested it thoroughly.  Throughout
the online help regarding the Secure Viewer and Tempest attacks, they
use phrases like "MAY reduce levels of radio frequency emissions" and
"MAY make it harder for the signals to be remotely detected" (my

@_subject: _PI_ was crap, but... 
It did inspire me to consider an interesting line of thought:
Maybe pi is the cyphertext and the 216-digit "Holy Unspeakable Name of
God" is the Vegenere-ish key.
I'll get to work and see if I can crack the message by lunchtime.

@_subject: _PI_ movie 
Hash: SHA1
My wife and I went and saw the movie _PI_ this past weekend.  I was
attracted to it 'cause of the subject matter.  One reviewer wrote that
the protagonist was a "tortured genius steeped in an intriguing blend
of advanced mathematics and mystical Jewish cabala."
I suspect a fair number of cypherpunks' curiosity would be piqued by
such a description.  Well, don't waste the 5 bucks.  It's
self-indulgent, pretentious, second-year-film-student crap.  It's
whiny, "woe-is-me-tortured-genius" drivel.  It's
effluvium.  Here's the plot, in a nutshell:
1. Ah, I understand advanced mathematics SO WELL; I see patterns
EVERYwhere!  But alas, I cannot enjoy life's pleasures because I am,
de rigueur, a TORTURED GENIUS!
2. And my mentor USED to be a TORTURED GENIUS, but he stopped studying
THE PROFOUND MYSTERIES, and now he's happy and FUN!  What a WUSS!
[Oh yeah, and I suffer REALLY bad migraines.]
3. Isn't PI cool?
4. Aren't Fibonacci numbers neat?
5. Whaddya suppose The Holy Unspeakable Name of God is?
6. Oh, easy, it's 9049348384737...[insert 198 digits here]...32343.
7. I RUSH to tell my mentor what I've discovered, but, alas, my
ruthless taunting prompted him to re-open his investigation of THE
PROFOUND MYSTERIES and he couldn't hack it -- his brain overloaded and
he died of a stroke.  Damn!
8. So I dramatically BURN all my PROFOUND MYSTERIES conclusions and
the director inserts the requisite "shocking scene everyone will be
talking about" by having me lobotomize myself with an electric drill.
9. Next, I'm sitting on a park bench, playing games with a child
(Quintessential Innocence).  I am finally ENJOYING LIFE, appreciating
the leaves on the trees and such.  But this kid, she wants to play
math games with me, which of course symbolizes the fact that IT'S NOT
10. The end.
And it's all shot on shitty stock in crackly black and white.  So
basically, it's about two gay cowboys and some pudding.

I hope you don't feel like this (cliche) message has actually
accomplished anything.  Posting this message to cypherpunks is preaching
to the choir.  Get out there and actually _DO_ something about it.
