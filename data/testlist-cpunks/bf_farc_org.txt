Auditing Classes at M.I.T., on the Web and Free
By CAREY GOLDBERG
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 3 Â Other universities may be striving to
market their courses to the Internet masses in hopes of dot-com
wealth. But the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has chosen
the opposite path: to post virtually all its course materials on
the Web, free to everybody.
 M.I.T. plans on Wednesday to announce a 10-year initiative,
apparently the biggest of its kind, that intends to create public
Web sites for almost all of its 2,000 courses and to post materials
like lecture notes, problem sets, syllabuses, exams, simulations,
even video lectures. Professors' participation will be voluntary,
but the university is committing itself to post sites for all its
courses, at a cost of up to $100 million.
 Visitors will not earn college credits.
 The giveaway idea,
President Charles M. Vest of M.I.T. said, came in a "traditional
Eureka moment" as the institute Â like nearly every other
university Â brainstormed and soul-searched about how best to take
advantage of the Internet.
 Called OpenCourseWare, the initiative found broad resonance among
the faculty members, said Steven Lerman, the faculty chairman.
 "Selling content for profit, or trying in some ways to
commercialize one of the core intellectual activities of the
university," Professor Lerman said, "seemed less attractive to
people at a deep level than finding ways to disseminate it as
broadly as possible."

Yes, see below.
Sure sounds possible, ergo plead-able.
The 5th is up to you to decide ---after all, only you know what

I think this came up during Monicagate.  (BTW, watch for your violations

JY or DM could easily take the 5th if they so chose.   Instead, every
word they choose
may be misconstrued; they have no idea of the context the persecutor

How would anyone (including themselves or their council) prove to the

the next wave?
Look at how JY "sent" JB out to "stalk" the CIA spook.
I would take some time (an hour) to consider any answers I chose to give
them, and I would write it down first.  Answers that I chose to give
would be as short as possible; "journalism" suffices to motivate
cryptome.  As well as DM's articles.
GJ folks should also leave the room and have a cup of coffee with their

the same wasted time as the speakers.
You don't have to speak to LE (including on the street), but if you do,
lying is a crime (though they can lie to you); best to say nil.
When you come back into the courtroom, see if you can time a fart as you

            Confederate T-Shirts Spark
            Fashion Fight in Southern
            Schools
            By Russ Bynum
            Associated Press Writer
            RICHMOND HILL, Ga. (AP) - Zane Dunn wore a
            banned T-shirt to school and became a rebel with a
            Confederate cause.
            Like six other students at Richmond Hill Middle
            School, 14-year-old Zane was suspended for a day
            because of the Confederate flag on the shirt.
            More than a century after Lee surrendered at
            Appomattox and a few months after defenders of
            Confederate symbols lost battles in the Georgia and
            South Carolina statehouses, the fight over Southern
            heritage has moved to schoolhouses.
            "My Confederate ancestors, they died for this flag,"
            said 14-year-old Zane, whose mother bought him the
            shirt after another student was suspended. "I was
            born and raised in the South and I have to stand up
            for it."
            Educators say they have banned Confederate
            symbols to prevent racial violence.
            Parents and students from Richmond Hill, 18 miles
            south of Savannah, wore Confederate shirts and
            bandanas to a recent Bryan County school board
            meeting to protest the suspensions last month.
            In Cairo, Ga., rebel flag-waving parents picketed
            their school board after 50 students at Cairo High
            School and Washington Middle School were told to
            change their Confederate shirts.
            The American Civil Liberties Union has gotten
            involved in a similar controversy in Brunswick, Ga.,
            where the principal of Jane Macon Middle School
            wrote to parents saying the shirts caused "rumors of
            threats and impending fights."
            Cairo High principal Wayne Tootle said the actions
            do not stem from political correctness but from
            school shootings that have taught administrators to
            be wary of anything that might lead to violence.
            "School folks are in a very precarious situation,"
            Tootle said. "If they don't do something to try to
            prevent, and something happens, then the parents
            and news media will just lambast them for what they
            didn't do."
            In recent years, children wearing Confederate
            symbols, even as backpack patches, have been
            punished in Kentucky, North Carolina and Virginia.
            In Georgia, the controversies followed the
            Legislature's move in January to change the state
            flag, which had been dominated by the Confederate
            emblem since 1956.
            School officials said bans on Confederate emblems
            have been in place for years, but the flag fight
            prompted students and parents to deliberately violate
            them.
            "Adults who want to keep arguing need to do
            something other than use our youngsters as a pawn
            in some political game," said Gary Russell,
            superintendent of the Bryan County school system.
            A lawyer representing parents in Richmond Hill and
            Cairo said the change in the Georgia flag has
            emboldened school officials.
            "The flag came down and they said, 'Oh, boy! It's
            open season on Confederate flags,'" said Kirk Lyons
            of the Southern Legal Resource Center, whose
            clients have included a former Ku Klux Klan grand
            dragon and the head of a North Carolina NAACP
            chapter.
            The classroom clashes have been a boon for Dewey
            Barber and his T-shirt company, Odum-based Dixie
            Outfitters, which has more than 200 shirt designs
            that incorporate the Confederate flag.
            "When they tell them they can't wear the rebel flag,
            they say, 'By gosh, we have the right of free speech
            and to our heritage!' And they buy more," Barber
            said.
            Dixie Outfitters shirts are so popular that some
            schools have banned them by brand name. Zane
            and his six fellow students all wore Dixie Outfitters
            shirts. Zane's shirt depicted a snarling, wild boar,
            with the Confederate emblem as a backdrop.
            Another Dixie Outfitters design shows just the flag's
            corners peeking from a basket of sleeping puppies.
            A third shirt depicts slaves working in a cotton field
            beneath the words "The Land of Cotton."
            No lawsuits have been filed in Georgia, but the state
            chapter of the ACLU has sent letters urging schools
            to lift the bans.
            Georgia ACLU legal director Gery Weber said the
            bans violate students' free-speech rights unless a
            school can show evidence that a shirt causes
            classroom disruptions.
            "It is hard to say a Confederate flag on a T-shirt is
            going to create that when, until recently, the Georgia
            flag had that on it and was placed in all the schools,"
            he said.
            Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected without
            comment the appeal of an Ohio student whose
            T-shirts of shock-rocker Marilyn Manson were
            banned from school.
            The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had sided with
            the school, saying it could ban shirts that were
            offensive, even if they didn't cause a serious
            disruption.
            But the same appeals court last month revived a
            lawsuit by two Kentucky students who were
            suspended for wearing Hank Williams Jr. shirts with
            the Confederate flag. The court said the school
            needed to better explain its reason for the ban, such
            as whether there had been racial violence.

Workplace Anger Over Police Screenings
                                               ID and fingerprint
requirements for Anaheim alcohol
                                            establishments disturb
employees, union and legal experts.
                                            By KIMI YOSHINO, Times Staff
                                                 Anaheim police are
under fire for requiring bartenders, janitors
                                            and other employees of
alcohol-selling establishments to carry
                                            city-issued identification
cards as well as provide officers with
                                            fingerprints and personal
                                                 A city ordinance
requiring the ID cards has been on the books
                                            since 1965. But officials
said an influx of new jobs--many related to
                                            Disney's resort
expansion--has prompted them to "re-educate" area
                                            businesses about the rules.
                                                 The ordinance requires
employees to complete an application
                                            asking about their
citizenship and arrest history, and whether they
                                            have any marks or scars. The
employees are also fingerprinted and
                                            photographed at the Police
                                                 The policy is unusual.
The Los Angeles Police Department and
                                            several other large
departments, including those in Long Beach and
                                            Huntington Beach, said they
don't require workers to hold ID cards
                                            or keep files on them.
                                                 Union officials said
they didn't know about the law until a few
                                            weeks ago, when they began
getting complaints from workers, who
                                            decried the requirements as
unfair and a violation of their rights.
                                                 "Why do we need an ID
card to sell a glass of chardonnay?"
                                            said Alastair Baird, 36, an
employee at Disneyland's exclusive Club
                                            33 who said he was frisked
by police officers before being
                                            fingerprinted at the jail.
"I'm just a waiter, and it felt like a criminal
                                            process."
                                                 An attorney for the
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees
                                            International Union has
asked the Anaheim City Council to rescind
                                            the ordinance at its meeting
next Tuesday and was joined by other
                                            groups in denouncing the ID
                                                 "It gives police
unbridled discretion to crack down on people
                                            they don't like," said Dan
Tokaji, a staff attorney with the American
                                            Civil Liberties Union of
Southern California. "This is not a police
                                            state. . . . You don't have
to have an identification card to live,
                                            work and enjoy the benefits
of freedom in our country."
                                                 Those who do not have
the laminated ID card are guilty of a
                                            misdemeanor and could be
fined. In addition, some employers have
                                            threatened to fire workers
who do not have the card, said union
                                            spokesman John Earl.
                                                 Police deny that they
are attempting to gather intelligence and
                                            emphasized that the
information will simply be kept on file in case it
                                            is needed as part of a
criminal investigation.
                                                 "Right now, it is our
belief that the ordinance is legal and
                                            constitutional, but the city
attorney's office is reviewing it to look
                                            into whatever issues are
being expressed," Sgt. Rick Martinez said.
                                                 Police run a warrants
check on those required to hold ID cards
                                            but do not conduct fuller
background investigations, he added. The
                                            information is not passed on
to employers or immigration
                                            authorities.
                                                 "We are very sensitive
to the INS issues in this city," Martinez
                                            said. "None of this would
ever go to INS. Our chief is very
                                            adamant about this. This has
nothing to do with citizenship status."
                                                 Baird, the waiter at
the Disneyland club, said he understands
                                            that the officers who took
his mug shot and fingerprinted him were
                                            only doing their jobs, but
he believes the ordinance is "over the
                                            top."
                                                 When he told his
co-worker, Carolyn Pelcak, about the
                                            application process, she
reported it to union officials. Many
                                            employees have decided not
to get ID cards until the issue is
                                            resolved with the city.
                                                 Other establishments in
Anaheim said the police have visited
                                            them regarding the ID cards
in recent years. Employees at
                                            Linbrook Bowl said police
cracked down on them in 1998. Though
                                            the bowling alley has been
open for more than 40 years, managers
                                            said they were unaware of
the rules until police showed up

                                                 Francesca Denatale, a
bartender at the bowling alley, said she
                                            paid a fine of about $75.
                                                 "I think it's
discriminatory that the field I work in has to be

                                                 University of Southern
California professor Erwin Chemerinsky,
                                            who specializes in
constitutional law, said it may be difficult to
                                            overturn the ordinance
because government is typically given great
                                            latitude in requiring
professional licenses.
                                                 "I think the legal
challenge to some of it will be difficult, but I am
                                            very troubled by this
because it really is an invasion of privacy,"
                                            Chemerinsky said.

Police arrest teen for obscene Web site
            By Associated Press, 01/13/01
            SALEM, N.H. -- Salem police have arrested a teen
            they say created several obscene Web sites that
            mocked the Salem Police Department.
            Christopher Hemmah, 19, was arrested Thursday
            night after a month-long investigation. He is charged
            with misuse of computer system information, a
            felony.
            In Hemmah's home, police say they found seven
            computers and how-to books on computer hacking.
            One of the obscene Web sites took information from
            the Salem Police Benevolent Association site and
            parodied it by changing words and downloading
            pictures from the site, police said. A second site
            mentioned the department and had random
            pornographic pictures attached to it, they said.

Why would I need the Aimster Pig Encoder?
                           As of Sunday March 4, 2001, at midnight,
Napster began
                           monitoring the file names that its users put
into the Napster
                           database, for the purpose of blocking certain
file names. This is a serious invasion of
                           your privacy as a Napster user. The file
names on your hard drive are your personal
                           property and should not be monitored by
anyone without your permission. The Aimster
                           Pig Encoder makes it more difficult for
anyone to monitor the file names on your
                           computer.
                      What does the Aimster Pig Encoder do?
                           The Aimster Pig Encoder is very simple but
effective. It takes each of the file names of
                           the mp3 files in your Napster directory and
encodes the file names so that the name
                           cannot be easily monitored.
                      What does it mean to "Encode" the file names?
                           The Aimster Pig Encoder encodes the file
names by simply changing the words in the file
                           name very slightly. For example, "Music"
becomes "usicM", "Hello" becomes "elloH",
                           and you can guess what becomes "uckF ouY, ouY
pyS astardsB".

Aimster Pig Encoder
                           works. Disclosing how the Aimster Pig Encoder

                           law called the DMCA and subject to up to a
$500,000 fine and 5 years in prison!
                           Seriously, we are not joking about this,
although we would agree that the situation
                           sounds quite funny (if it wasn't so sad).
There is already a similar case in which someone
                           has been found guilty simply for printing an
encoder secret on a t-shirt! If anyone asks
                           you how the Aimster Pig Encoder works, tell
them to download it and find out for
                           themselves!
                      But won't spies and eavesdroppers just figure out
how the Aimster Pig Encoder works and
                      monitor my file names anyway!?
                           Possibly yes, but it won't be nearly as easy.
And if they do, they may be violating the
                           same federal law called the DMCA and
themselves be subject to up to a $500,000 fine
                           and 5 years in prison! Now that really is
funny (and not quite so sad). Peace out. And

   STOCKHOLM, March 7 (AFP) - The Swedish secret service is trying

and the Attac association, which promotes a tax on financial

gatherings such as the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,
the EU summit in Nice, France, and the December 1999 global finance
and trade meetings in Seattle, Washington.

German armed forces ban MS software, citing NSA snooping
                      By: John Lettice
                      Posted: 17/03/2001 at 18:59 GMT
                      The German foreign office and Bundeswehr are
pulling the plugs on Microsoft
                      software, citing security concerns, according to
the German news magazine
                      Der Spiegel. Spiegel claims that German security
authorities suspect that the
                      US National Security Agency (NSA) has 'back door'
access to Microsoft
                      source code, and can therefore easily read the
Federal Republic's deepest
                      secrets.
                      The Bundeswehr will no longer use American
software (we surmise this
                      includes Larry and Scott as well) on computers
used in sensitive areas. The
                      German foreign office has meanwhile put plans for
videoconferencing with its
                      overseas embassies on hold, for similar reasons.
Under secretary of state
                      Gunter Pleuger is said by Spiegel to have
discovered that "for technical
                      reasons" the satellite service that was to be used
was routed via Denver,
                      Colorado.
                      According to a colleague of Pleuger's this meant
that the German foreign
                      services "might as well hold our conferences
directly in Langley." We're not
                      entirely sure whose interesting video conferencing
via satellite service has a
                      vital groundstation in Denver, but we note that
Pleuger seems to have gleaned
                      this information from a presentation held earlier
this month in Berlin by, er,
                      Deutsche Telekom.
                      Which just happens, along with Siemens, to have
picked up the gig. The two
                      companies have supplanted Microsoft (and anything
else American) and will
                      be producing a secure, home-grown system that the
German military can be
                      confident in.

School's Ban of Manson T-Shirt OK
               By Laurie Asseo
               Associated Press Writer
               WASHINGTON (AP) - A former high school student says he
had a
               free-speech right to wear Marilyn Manson T-shirts to
class. But
               school officials banned them as offensive, and on Monday
               student lost a Supreme Court appeal.
               The court, without comment, turned down the Ohio
               argument that school officials could not keep him from
               T-shirts depicting Manson, a "shock rock" star who took
his stage
               name from Marilyn Monroe and mass killer Charles Manson.
               Nicholas J. Boroff was a senior when he arrived at Van
Wert High
               School in Van Wert, Ohio, in August 1997 wearing a
               Manson T-shirt. Manson's real name is Brian Warner, and
               group also is named Marilyn Manson.
               The front of the shirt depicted a three-faced Jesus and
the back of
               the shirt said "believe" with the letters "lie"
               A school administrator told Boroff the shirt was
offensive and told
               him to either turn it inside out, go home and change, or
leave and
               be considered truant.
               Boroff left, and returned each of the next four school
days wearing
               other Marilyn Manson T-shirts. Each time he was told he
could not
               attend class wearing the shirt.
               Boroff sued, saying school officials violated his
constitutional rights
               to free speech and due process. A federal judge ruled for
               school district, and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals agreed.
               School officials could ban the shirts because they were
               determined to be "vulgar, offensive and contrary to the
               mission of the school," the appeals court said, noting
that school
               officials submitted evidence of the group's "pro-drug
               Public schools can prohibit students from wearing shirts
that are
               offensive, even if they are not obscene and have not
caused a
               substantial disruption of the school program, the appeals
               said.
               In the appeal acted on Monday, Boroff's lawyers said that
               there was evidence that Manson had promoted drug use and
               Satanism, that did not mean school officials could ban
               from wearing his name and picture.
               Lawyers for the school district said the group's song
lyrics had
               racial epithets, obscene language and "exhortations to
suicide and
               violence."
               The case is Boroff v. Van Wert City Board of Education,

            Court Says Innocent Can Refuse
            to Testify
            By Anne Gearan
            Associated Press Writer
            WASHINGTON (AP) - "Taking the Fifth" is an option
            open to the innocent as well as the guilty, the
            Supreme Court ruled Monday.
            The unanimous decision stems from the conviction
            of an Ohio man in the "shaken baby" death of his
            infant son. The Supreme Court affirmed the right of
            the family baby sitter to claim Fifth Amendment
            protection from self-incrimination even if prosecutors
            did not accuse her of wrongdoing.
            Matthew Reiner claimed the baby sitter harmed
            10-week-old Alex in 1995, but Toledo prosecutors
            instead focused on him and planned to call the baby
            sitter to testify against him.
            They did not intend to prosecute Susan Batt, but she
            nevertheless refused to testify unless given a
            promise of immunity. Otherwise, she would exercise
            her Fifth Amendment right not to testify, she told
            prosecutors.
            When she testified, Batt denied ever harming Alex or
            his twin brother, who suffered broken bones. Reiner
            was convicted in 1996 and sentenced to probation.
            The Ohio Supreme Court ultimately threw out the
            conviction on grounds that Batt's protected testimony
            unfairly undermined Reiner's defense.
            Ohio prosecutors appealed to the U.S. Supreme
            Court, which issued a short, unsigned opinion
            Monday without hearing oral arguments.
            "That tells us it was so clear the Ohio Supreme Court
            was wrong in its analysis of the facts and the law,"
            Toledo prosecutor J. Christopher Anderson said.
            Monday's decision apparently reinstates Reiner's
            conviction, Anderson said.
            Even if Batt had nothing to do with Alex's death, she
            had a reasonable fear that testifying "might tend to
            incriminate her," the justices wrote.
            "Batt spent extended periods of time alone with Alex
            and his brother in the weeks immediately preceding
            discovery of their injuries. She was with Alex within
            the potential timeframe of the fatal trauma," the
            justices wrote.
            Hence, Batt was free to assert her Fifth Amendment
            rights, the justices said.
            Previous Supreme Court decisions set a precedent
            that the Fifth Amendment "protects the innocent as
            well as the guilty," the court said.
            The case is Ohio v. Reiner, 00-1028.

Irvington Pupils Face
               Charges for Playing With
               Paper Gun.
               March 22, 2001
               IRVINGTON, N.J. (AP) _ Two second-graders playing cops
               and robbers with a paper gun were charged with making
               terrorist threats.
               The boys' parents said the situation should have been
               resolved in the principal's office, but Police Chief
               Palamara on Wednesday defended school officials and the
               district's zero-tolerance policy.
               ``It may appear to some as though we went a little
               overboard because it was a paper gun, but what would
               those same people say if this incident was ignored and in
               day, week or month the same student came to school with a
               firearm?'' Palamara asked.
               Authorities said that 8-year-old Hamadi Alston stood up
               his desk at Augusta Street School last Thursday, pointed
               paper folded to look like a gun at his classmates and
               ``I'm going to kill you all.''
               Hamadi said he was imitating what his friend, Jaquill
               Shelton, had done earlier that day.
               The police chief said Jaquill had given Hamadi the paper
               gun in the bathroom.
               The two boys were suspended and, under the district's
               zero-tolerance policy, school officials notified police,
               charged the boys.
               ``Although the paper handgun posed no immediate threat to
               the students in the class, the words spoken certainly and
               appropriately were recognized by school officials and
               police as warning signs to cause concern,'' Palamara
               The court can now determine whether either boy needs
               counseling or just a stern warning, he said.
               The parents, as well as the Essex County prosecutor's
               office, were involved immediately, he said.
               The prosecutor's office did not immediately return a
               message seeking comment on Wednesday.
               ``This is just stupid, stupid, stupid,'' Ron Alston,
               father, told The Star-Ledger of Newark. ``How can you
               two boys to the police precinct over a paper gun? This is
               very bad judgment.''
               Superintendent Ernest Smith said he believes the boys
               meant no harm, but district policy requires that police
               notified of such incidents.
               ``I thought this was unfortunate,'' Smith said. ``But,
               that kids are being shot in schools across the country,
               children have to be taught they can't say certain words
               public.''

Subsequently, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit verified that
public accessibility is "the touchstone in determining whether a
constitutes a 'printed publication'" (In re Hall, 228 USPQ 453, 455
Cir. 1986]).
Accordingly, the current test for determining whether a disclosure is a
printed publication focuses on the accessibility of the information
than on the form of the alleged prior art. Therefore, the fact that a
reference is "printed" electronically, rather than on paper, is relevant
the printed publication determination only to the extent that
publication in
an electronic form may affect public availability.
Internet publications are particularly amenable to the current printed
publication test. Any information posted on Internet becomes accessible
interested parties throughout the world. Moreover, servers that store
posted information also can provide the date that the information became
Next, I found something both recent and quasi-official! From a WIPO
(international law) report in November 2000 summarizing U.S. law on the
issue. Most interestingly, the report explains that official U.S.

B.       United States of America
21. 35 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 102(a) and (b) provides:
         "Â§ 102  Conditions for patentability; novelty and loss of right
         A person shall be entitled to a patent unless --
                  (a) the invention was known or used by others in this
country, or patented or
         described in a printed publication in this or a foreign
before the invention
         thereof by the applicant for patent, or
                  (b) the invention was patented or described in a
publication in this or a

22. The law does not contain any special provision concerning disclosure
the Internet
and its prior art effect.  However, the "Manual of Patent Examining
Procedure (MPEP),"
issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO),
guidelines with
respect to the status of electronic publications as prior art and

the USPTO has published an "Internet Usage Policy"7 in order to provide
guidance to its
employees regarding the use of the Internet for official USPTO business.
The "Policy" covers
the usage of the Internet to search for information concerning patent

database or
Internet publication, is considered to be a "printed publication" within
meaning of

concerned with
the art to which the document relates.  Indeed, in In re Wyer, the court
stated:  "Accordingly,
whether information is printed, handwritten, or on microfilm or a
disc or tape, etc.,
the one who wishes to characterize the information, in whatever form it
be, as a `printed
publication' *** should produce sufficient proof of its dissemination or
that it has otherwise
been available and accessible to persons concerned with the art to which
document relates
and thus most likely to avail themselves of its contents" (citation

that a single copy of
