I just posted the following article. You may wish to consider the
subject and post your own conclusions. If you post to asar, please
set followups to asard so that the discussion doesn't bother the
other folks on asar.

I know this will make some people unhappy but I will not allow the
passing of encrypted data through the twwells anonymous server.
Responsible running of an APS requires the ability to audit what
passes through and encryption defeats that.
Some time in the future, I may consider how one may use
encryption with my server; such a system will retain the
possibility of decryption at the server.
Followups have been directed to asar.d.
 --------------------------------------------------
I have to say I disagree strongly with your position. Responsible
running of an anonymous service requires that the administrator *DOES*
*NOT* audit what passes through.
I feel that any anonymous service operator has no business looking at
the contents of other people's messages, and any attempt at doing so is
a gross violation of the trust of his/her users.
Your statement seems to indicate that you find it morally acceptable to
monitor the messages your users send using your server. How would you
feel if US Mail would get into the habit of peeking at the letters you
send "to ensure responsible running of the US Mail System"?
Please respond by e-mail, as I don't read a.s.a.r.

I replied publicly (to reassure the people on asar); here's the
substance of my reply:

Well, analogies are always slippery, but let me change the analogy
a little to illustrate. Let's speak of UPS (or whatever your
parcel post is called). How would if feel if UPS would open my
parcels? That depends. If they did it for gratuitous reasons, I'd
pick another postal service. If, on the other hand, I was worried
about terrorists posting bombs, I would thank them.
ASAR is a different place than most on the net and there are a lot
of people worried about bombs in their parcels. As far as I'm
concerned, it's a matter of choice. Some people will worry and so
be thankful that I have the policies I do; others will be upset
and use the other services.
 --------------------------------------------------
And you decide when that is, right?
And *you*, in your infinite wisdom, will know what is perping and what
is not? And who to watch and who not to?
Why? Why should such a discussion be avoided at all costs?
Why is moral judgement outside the bounds of discussion?
I would not use the word "secrecy". I would use the word "privacy". That's
why users use your service! But you are saying they *don't* have a right
to privacy!
If I'm worried about bombs, I might ask UPS or somebody else to check my
parcels. But I don't want them to rummage through all my parcels on the
pretense of looking for bombs, especially without asking me first.
True. Some people might actually want you to pre-check their messages.
Others might want to use other servers.
Fair enough, as long as you *tell* your users that's what happening!

True. And that's why PGP-based stuff & remailer chains is the way to go
for "hard" anonymity. But for posting to general newsgroups, we also
need a system with working return paths. This doesn't seem possible with
current remailer chain systems.

I think we should come up with a more socially acceptable solution.
Widespread use of hit-and-run abuse on the net would certainly lead to
actions against sites such as anon.penet.fi. Some method that preserves
a return path is needed for a *general* posting facility
(alt.whistleblowers etc. would be special cases). And... Please remember
anon.penet.fi has something like 13000 existing users. And most of them
have been using other anonymous posting hosts with the same
limitations/defaults as anon.penet.fi. So we can't change everything

Unless you include your password in the message! Remember that
anon.penet.fi can pick up the X-Anon-To: and X-Anon-Password: lines from
the start of the message text - they don't have to be header fields.
The social implications are more important.
I repeat: for general postings, we have to come up with a way to provide
anonymity while retaining a return path. Otherwise chaos ensues, just
look at the most blatant misuses of anon postings witnessed recently!

Well, it could be somebody who doesn't care about his/her own anonymity,
but wants to make it as easy as possible to send anon mail to him/her.
It's so much easier to mail to anXXXX at anon.penet.fi than to use stuff
like user%host.domain at anon.penet.fi or hack around with strange extra
X-Anon-* headers (especially with anally-retentive mailers etc.).

@_date: 1993-02-23 01:12:12

Neither do I. But many of the users of anon.penet.fi are
not very computer-and-email-literate, and they have been using other
services, providing double-blind. Unfortunate, but too late to change now...
What we can do is to provide better ways for those who *are* computer
literate enough to use extra headers etc.
But in this case I feel the principle of least astonishment is overruled
by the principle of least risk of accidental exposure.
I think that hornet's nest needed to be kicked. But I am also
disappointed that not enough people defend the need for anonymity in
places like news.admin.policy.
I think pseudonyms *should* be prominent - as you have noticed, anon.penet.fi
adds an explicit warning at the end of every message.

I have sent the person a message informing him/her that the account will
be blocked if the inappropriate postings continue. In an international
world, where laws, customs and morals vary from one place and culture to
another, and where a lot of people are trying to force their views onto
others, the only way a service like anon.penet.fi can operate is by very
simple and firm rules that are followed without exception. One rule is
that I *never* reveal the true identity of an anon user, and another is
that I *never* block access to the server without warning and without
giving the person a chance to defend him/herself.
I do understand your views, and I am very sympatetic to them, but I hope

re-establish the service as soon as there had been enough opposition to

At this point, only two groups are blocked, rec.nude and soc.singles,
both as a result of a formal poll on the group in question.
I suppose this is why we are creating alt.whistleblowers. Other people
could forward those messages to any potentially blocked groups.

True. Actually, I want to ask for some help/advice. I am about to
implement alt.whistleblower on anon.penet.fi. But one thing I think I
would like some input on is the description text of the newsgroup for
the newsgroups file.
A more important matter is the way the group should be implemented.
Moderated or unmoderated doesn`t matter, as the server already knows how
to send messages to moderated groups to the moderator. But how should it
differ from other groups on anon.penet.fi? All groups will be able to
accept PGP-encrypted messages, but I was thinking of making a.w a
special case where id's aren't allocated at all, and every message would
just come from "an000000" or something. Is this a good idea? Pros are
that it would make it very hard to track down the real poster, cons that
it would be impossible to tell the different posters from each other,
thus not enabling informers to earn good or bad reputations, unless they
include key signatures or something.

thus avoiding the problem (yes, I've implemented the feature, but I

Well, you can't have your cake and eat it. I do know the dilemma you are
facing, as I have to face the issue pretty regularily. Either you just
provide the service without any regard for the contents, or keep logs
and play police every now and then. With anon.penet.fi the choice is
simple because the way the server works - there has to be a database
mapping anon id's to real addresses, and anyway it is possible to flame
orginators of abusive stuff without even knowing their true identity.
But in the general case it is a pretty complicated ethical issue...

@_subject: Software infrastructure 
I'm rather surprised that nobody has mentioned UUPC. It's PD, runs on
plain-vanilla DOS, and allows automatic, batched mail traffic (and even
netnews) to/from your local PC.
On your host (typically an UNIX box) you configure
sendmail/smail/binmail/whatever to forward your mail over uucp to your
home machine. On the home machine, you simply configure UUCP to poll
when needed, and transfer the stuff down onto your local disk. From
there you can use UUPC's local mail reader (or any mail package you
want), and the replies get spooled to a spool directory, and uploaded
automatically the next time you (or the software) opens the connection.
Automatic polling, automatic bi-directional batch file transfer,
insertion of encryption trivial....
I use it to read and reply to my mail while on the beach, using a
notebook computer and a cellular phone... The ability to efficiently
batch transfer the stuff makes a *big* difference if you are paying
cellular rates...

Since I announced my intention to re-establish the full anon.penet.fi

ideas. I just want to clarify my situation. What I'm doing now is to
simply re-establish the old service, without any changes/improvements
(except for an AUP-free connection and a faster box). This gives me time
to work on the improved Mk II with support for PGP, multiple ID's,
selectable double/single blind etc.
I expect to bring up Mk II as penet.anonymous.net this fall, but I need
some time to implement the stuff, write documentation etc., and I have
to take care of my "daytime" jobs as well. Somebody has to pay for all
that new hardware and that international connection... Not mentioning my

I just had to deal with a minor crisis caused by CERT. They contacted the
domain-admin for the *.fi domain, saying they had been informed that the
anonymous ftp archive at anon.penet.fi was being used to distribute
illegal copies of software. They did *not* contact me directly, nor my
service provider.
The last time anon.penet.fi was shut down was exactly because of
somebody contacting the domain-admin, who happens to be a person working
for a competitor to my service provider.
Fortunately I could tell them that anon.penet.fi didn't even run ftp at
all, easily verifiable by trying to ftp from anon.penet.fi. They did
apologize profusely, but somehow that doesn't quite...

@_subject: RISKS for alt.whistleblowers 
True. But at least the source of the trouble would be hard to hide.
Yes. This might be the hardest one, and the one I have been worrying
We will have to accept the fact that we are sitting ducks. It all
depends on how strong support we have.
True. And that's why we have to abide to the old banner "united we stand,
divided we fall". We need to support each other, and have organisations such
as EFF supporting our cause as well. In many ways our case (with
whistleblowers) is very similar to organisations such as Amnesty
International. Single groups and individuals are easy to silence, but a
big enough, distributed enough and visible enough organization with good
communications channels is much harder to shoot down. Hmm... Maybe we
ought to get in touch with people like Amnesty and offer our services to
them as well?
Anyway, let me give you a hypotetical case. Let's say anon.penet.fi
starts running alt.whistleblower, and some suitable US organisation
decides to shut it down. They can do it by using international
political pressure - something that would definitely be effective if it
was something that was done silently by agreement between the Finnish
and the US government agencies involved. But it would be impossible if
the thing was exposed to international media. Similarily for cases of
putting pressure to telephone/network companies, or trying to kill the
server with stuff breaking local laws or something.

All this is very well for a cypherpunks-type remailer, used by a small

posting/mailing services for a large number of "simple" users (services like
anon.penet.fi), nor to alt.whistleblower. Do we need to split up the

I don't think this was intended for me (anon at penet.fi, the anon server

I agree with your disagreement but disagree with your conclusion (huh?).
IMHO a remailer operator should *NEVER* reveal any identities, but I

news articles, there has to be a way to send replies to the original
sender. Thus a remailer must maintain mapping info.

and I have already ordered the replacement, a 60 Mhz 486 to handle the

Anon.penet.fi already does this. As long as we have something to pattern
match for (to separate alt.sex.bestiality at anon.penet.fi from
xy656b-akw at anon.penet.fi).

from alt.sexual.abuse.recovery or alt.transgendered. And at least

@_subject: anon.penet.fi bites the dust 
Today I posted the attached message to various newsgroups. I still plan
to continue mail service, and my work on the alt.whistleblowers project.
The anonymous posting service at anon.penet.fi has been closed down. Postings
to netnews and mail to arbitrary addresses has been blocked.
Mail to anonymous users will still be supported, so anon.penet.fi can be
used as an anonymous P.O.Box service.
Due to the lawsuit-intensive climate in the US, many anonymous services have
been short-lived. By setting up anon.penet.fi in Finland, I hoped to create
a more stable service. Anon.penet.fi managed to stay in operation for almost
five months. The service was protected from most of the usual problems that
had forced other services to shut down. But there are always going to be
ways to stop something as controversial as an anon service. In this case, a
very well-known and extremely highly regarded net personality managed to
contact exactly the right people to create a situation where it is
politically impossible for me to continue running the service.
But of course this political situation is mainly caused by the abuse of the
network that a very small minority of anon users engaged in. This small
group of immature and thoughtless individuals (mainly users from US
universities) caused much aggravation and negative feelings towards the
service. This is especially unfortunate considering these people really are
a minuscule minority of anon users. The latest statistics from the service
show 18203 registered users, 3500 messages per day on the average, and
postings to 576 newsgroups. Of these users, I have received complaints
involving postings from 57 anonymous users, and, of these, been forced to
block only 8 users who continued their abuse despite a warning from me.
In retrospect I realize that I have been guilty to keeping a far too low
profile on the network, prefering to deal with the abuse cases privately
instead of making strong public statements. Unfortunately I realized this
only a couple of days before being forced to shut down the service, but the
results of a single posting to alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.d gave very
positive results. I take full blaim for my failure to realize the
psychological effects of a strongly stated, publicly visible display of
policy with regards to the abuse cases. For this I have to apologize to the
whole net community.
On the other hand I am deeply concerned by the fact that the strongest
opposition to the service didn't come from users but from network
administrators. I don't think sysadmins have a god-given mandate to
dictate what's good for the users and what's not. A lot of users have
contacted me to thank me for the service, describing situations where
anonymity has been crucial, but I could never have imagined in my wildest
dreams. At the same time quite a few network administrators have made
comments like "I can't imagine any valid use for anonymity on the net" and
"The only use for anonymity is to harrass and terrorize the net".
Nevertheless, I really want to apologize both to all the users on the
network who have suffered from the abusive misuse of the server, and to all
the users who have come to rely on the service. Again, I take full
responsibility for what has happened.

@_subject: REMAIL: cypherpunks strategy 
Agree 100%.
Uh... I'm not so sure FUNET (the Finnish University NETwork) would agree
with you ;-)
But the truly overwhelming response in support of anon.penet.fi (I still
get flooded by notes of sympathy and support) on the net seems actually
to make a difference, as does effort of prominent personalities (especially
Peter Honeyman) to contact the Finnish autorithies. After talking to
them today, I might actually risk putting up the service again. But I
feel that to ensure that this is the last time the net.demigods try to
close down a server like this we should do our best to address their
concerns. This way, everybody saves face, and we might get a lot of
brownie points.
So what I would like to suggest is that I announce that anon.penet.fi
mark II goes on the air - let's say April 15th, with slightly changed
policies and with all the technical improvements we've been discussing.
And meanwhile I set up an adress for receiving sugestions on
improvements (both technical and political), and encourage newsgroups to
do polls on allowing or disallowing anonymity in that particular group.
But before doing anything, I really would like to get comments, views
and ideas from all of you!
Couldn't agree more. If I go for anon.penet.fi Mk. II, I really want to
replace the current mess of shell and awk scripts with something more
efficient (linear search of a 0.5 meg database isn't very speedy...),
and I really would like to have code to check that the incoming SMTP
message actually comes from and existing site, and so on - so there is a
lot of coding to be done that I really could use some help on!
Yes! I don't know how to express how important the support has been! You
really have to be a stubborn, crazy bastard to do anything like this,
but the hate mail still wears you down if you don't get a kind word of
encouragement every now and then. I really have to thank all of you for
your support!
Well, looking at the way the discussion is going all over the net, I
think we might be almost there already!

The problem is that I live in a country where somebody got thrown in

Sorry to interrupt the Detweiler thread, but...
As of last week, my server has been sending the following message to active
users of my anonymous service. I am turning to you, fellow cypherpunks, not for
monetary support (albeit that is of course welcome, too) but to ask for ideas
on how to arrange the payment mechanism - and to avoid taxes, currency export
problems etc. Maybe I should seek the help of a non-profit organisation such as EFF to
handle the transfers?
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Hi! You have just used the anonymous server at anon.penet.fi. When I set it up,
almost a year ago, I definitely could not foresee how popular it would become.
It now has something like 45.000 registered users, wuth maybe 10.000 active
users. Thousands of mesages are handled each day.
Unfortunately, the popularity of the server might also be it's downfall. At
the start, it was easy to handle all the problems and the queries, and to
pay for the network connection. But now I spend 4-5 hours every day trying
to answer questions, fix problems and deal with abusers - but I keep getting
further and further behind on my mailbox. And the traffic is overloading the
64K international connection - I already had to cut out the binary postings.
It now costs me something close to USD 1500/month just to keep the machine
I'm afraid I can't afford the time and the money much longer. And unless
there suddenly turns up some benevolent big sponsor, the only hope for
survival for the service is contributions from individual users. If all the
10.000 active users would each contribute $5, it would pay for the costs
of running the service for a full year, as well as allowing me to employ one
or two part-time students to reply to mail queries, improve the service, and
report abuse - allowing me to concentrate on improving the software and dealing
with the abuse cases.
So I'm asking you - how much would you be willing to contribute? Use of the
server will always be free, but continuing the service needs soem funds.
At this stage, I only need to know how much you are willing to contribute -
$1, $5, $25, $100? The replies will determine the need to set up some
kind of money transfer system. Please send your replies to donations at penet.fi.

Whooaa! Slow....
Please remember that the former SU is full of "companies" that claim to be
*the* whatever national initiative of Russia. Mostly they are just a couple
of former research scientists with a Grand Plan, and usually they have no clue
as to how to make it fly. They just think that with the new market echonomy,
simply forming a company and having some Big Words will make them filty rich
I know there are exceptions. But.. Beware.

Also, when talking about "quite a number" with regard to X-SU, remember the
scale of things. Relcom/EUnet, the commercial IP network provider out there,
has something like 120 POPs and 20,000 registered domains... And they consider
themselves still in the start-up phase...

I still can't reply to M. Stirner because he still uses a illegal user name.
Double periods in a user name is a _bad_ idea. But perhaps he doesn't want
to receive any mail.
Find out the facts first. You don't need passwords to send to anXXXX users.
Autoreplies work perfectly well. It's just that *your* real return address
doesn't work!
Sorry about sounding irritated, but we have discussed your dysfunctional return
address several times, and you haven't fixed it, instead blaiming the problems
on everything else...

It shure should be in the help file. But the whole help file needs

I hate the automatic anonymizing myself, but for historical reasons that
had to be done. Can be fixed in the next reincarnation of the server
if documented clearly enough.
Right. There is a solution, but it has to wait for MK II.
Right. Amazing, spectacular - maybe, but impending... Sigh...

Uh... I, of course, am a bona fide citizen. Was just about to announce
my new server in Frankfurt, Arkansas. But as I am having minor problems
with my system, my e-mail address currently *appears* to be in Finland.
But rest assured all stuff automatically gets rerouted to AK, and doesn't
go outside the states. By the way, do you know any service providers who
accept payments for Internet connections in rubles, caviar and vodka?
And any hints on nice real estate in the caribbean.
Oh yes,  ;-) ;-) ;-)

No. I meant Frankfurt. But you are partly right, as I wanted a non-existent place, and as I thought about weird places I had
visisited, Stuttgart, AR came to mind. But it had to be a fictionary
place, so I changed it to Frankfurt. Of course, there probably *is*
a Frankfurt somewhere in Arkansas ;-)
Ahh. So it is! Thanks!
And for those who are thinking "what the hell does this have to do

I agree. But we need to have a meeting, not a virtual reality.
MOOs are a really interesting social experiment, but I prefer to live
in the real world. IRC is a simple, straightforward everyday tool that
doesn't get in your way and doesn't try to impose some internal fake
universe on you.
Sure. And my notebok PC is much more unreliable than my Sun. It's keyboard
keeps going dead. So we should all abandon PC:s and switch to Suns ;-)

Uh... Yes, I think experimenting with new ways to run a virtual meeting
is A Good Thing. But... We have a meeting to run. So how about
sticking to familiar tools for the actual meeting, so that we can concentrate
on the *issues* at hand, and schedule the experimental stuff separately.
If we need "rows" and whatever, why not just form a dozen separate IRC channels,
one on each sub-issue, and you can join as many or as few as you like at one
time. Let's not complicate things too much - we have a war to fight!

Yep. This evil and malicious tentacle has indeed blocked an12070. As well

Yeah. I'm currently in Boston, so I would have to transfer the stuff

Hmm. Maybe I should rejoin the cypherpunks list, after all..
It does. But only if the user hasn't set a password. That's why I implemented
the password feature! I have also zapped all queued-up "tuna" messages.
But the whole current server is getting to be a horrible patchwork. I am
working on a total redesign/rewrite, as well as upgrading the machine and
the connection, to eliminate the delays and allow PGP. But to do all that,
I am going to need sponsors/support. Preliminary discussions started
with a couple of organisations.

Sigh. If trying to avoid re-inventing square wheels and duplicating stuff

very proud to join Perry in the "pseudo-tentacle wet blanket club". One
of the major reasons I still read this list is so that I can find out when
I am wasting my time - if somebody has come up with a workable solution, and
it seems likely to gain wide acceptance, it is rather stupid of me to
hide in my magical cyberspace fairytale virtualland and write code that
no-one is going to pick up and use. But of course I am free to do so, should
I so desire...
