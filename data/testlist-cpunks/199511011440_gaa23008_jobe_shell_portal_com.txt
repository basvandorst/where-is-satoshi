@_subject: US government department for crime enforcement! 
It's come to my attention that the US government has a group
called the 'Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network' in Vienna, Virginia.
I know that burocrats like to keep themselves busy, but even I didn't think they would go so far as to enforce crimes to keep the law enforcement people busy.
What a curious way to spend the taxpayers money.
P.S. :-) for the humor impaired.
