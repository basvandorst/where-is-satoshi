@_subject: Colossus in action 
Just in case anyone is as ill informed as me, I was delighted to read at  that the rebuilt Colossus is or is about to be used on a message enciphered on a Lorenz machine and transmitted from Germany.
Following the links from that page I see that the message will be "intercepted" using the radio equipment of the time before the Colossus tries to work out the settings. There will be  parallel effort with modern radio equipment and computers. It should be an interesting race.
I admire those who had the enthusiasm to rebuild the machine and who had the contacts to get hold of the plans and notes that remained. The last time I took a particular interest in the project, some years ago, they were trying to find the right sort of valve and had just completed the framework for hurtling paper tape round and round.
