's First Flying File-Sharing Drones in Action
A few days ago The Pirate Bay announced that in future parts of its site
could be hosted on GPS controlled drones. To many this may have sounded like
a joke, but in fact these pirate drones already exist. Project "Electronic
Countermeasures" has built a swarm of five fully operational drones which
prove that an "aerial Napster" or an "airborne Pirate Bay" is not as
futuristic as it sounds.

an ever-continuing effort to thwart censorship, The Pirate Bay plans to turn
flying drones into mobile hosting locations

"Everyone knows WHAT TPB is. Now they're going to have to think about WHERE
TPB is," The Pirate Bay team told TorrentFreak last Sunday, announcing their
drone project.
Liam Young, co-founder of Tomorrow 's Thoughts Today, was amazed to read the announcement, not so much because
of the technology, because his group has already built a swarm of
file-sharing drones. "I thought hold on, we are already doing that," Young told TorrentFreak. Their starting point for project "Electronic Countermeasures" was to create
something akin to an 'aerial Napster' or 'airborne Pirate Bay', but it
became much more than that.
"Part nomadic infrastructure and part robotic swarm, we have rebuilt and
programmed the drones to broadcast their own local Wi-Fi network as a form
of aerial Napster. They swarm into formation, broadcasting their pirate
network, and then disperse, escaping detection, only to reform elsewhere,"
says the group describing their creation.

In short the system allows the public to share data with the help of flying
drones. Much like the Pirate Box
 , but one that flies autonomously over the
"The public can upload files, photos and share data with one another as the
drones float above the significant public spaces of the city. The swarm
becomes a pirate broadcast network, a mobile infrastructure that passers-by
can interact with," the creators explain. One major difference compared to more traditional file-sharing hubs is that
it requires a hefty investment. Each of the drones costs 1500 euros to
build. Not a big surprise, considering the hardware that's needed to keep
these pirate hubs in the air.
"Each one is powered by 2x 2200mAh LiPo batteries. The lift is provided by
4x Roxxy Brushless Motors that run off a GPS flight control board. Also on
deck are altitude sensors and gyros that keep the flight stable. They all
talk to a master control system through XBee wireless modules," Young told
"These all sit on a 10mm x 10mm aluminum frame and are wrapped in a vacuum
formed aerodynamic cowling. The network is broadcast using various different
hardware setups ranging from Linux gumstick modules, wireless routers and
USB sticks for file storage."
For Young and his crew this is just the beginning. With proper financial
support they hope to build more drones and increase the range they can
cover. "We are planning on scaling up the system by increasing broadcast range and
building more drones for the flock. We are also building in other systems
like autonomous battery change bases. We are looking for funding and backers
to assist us in scaling up the system," he told us.
Those who see the drones in action (video below) will notice that they're
not just practical. The creative and artistic background of the group shines
through, with the choreography performed by the drones perhaps even more
stunning than the sharing component.
"When the audience interacts with the drones they glow with vibrant colors,
they break formation, they are called over and their flight pattern becomes
more dramatic and expressive," the group explains. Besides the artistic value, the drones can also have other use cases than
being a "pirate hub." For example, they can serve as peer-to-peer
communications support for protesters and activists in regions where
Internet access is censored.
Either way, whether it's Hollywood or a dictator, there will always be
groups that have a reason to shoot the machines down. But let's be honest,
who would dare to destroy such a beautiful piece of art?

Dear people
Here is the Google Translate English version (I did some editing) of the
official report on the meeting between President Rousseff and ICANN's
President and CEO Fadi Chehadé, which just happened.
The original version in Brazilian Portuguese is at the end.
fraternal regards
Brazil will host world event on Internet governance
Brazil will host the meeting in 2014 to discuss the necessary changes to
Internet governance. After meeting with the president of the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann, its acronym in English),
Fadi Chehadé, President Dilma Rousseff agreed to meet global leaders from
different sectors interested in the topic.
According to Chehadé, the world counts on Brazil's leadership on this issue,
after President Dilma Rousseff spoke at the opening of the 68th UN General
Assembly, held in September in the United States. "The world heard the
Brazilian president, who spoke with deep conviction, with great courage, and
expressed the frustration that many people around the world feel about the
fact that the trust relationship we have with the Internet had been
broken,"said, revealing that the speech by Dilma was the motivation of his
proposal for their meeting.
Chehadé cited allegations of espionage involving the communication of
Brazilian authorities and citizens, among them the very president, Petrobras
and the Ministry of Mines and Energy. "I came to ask the president to
elevate her leadership to a new level, to ensure that we can all get
together around a new model of governance in which all are equal," he said.
The president of Icann said that future decisions on how leaders can manage
the internet should be based on the principles of the Civil Rights Framework
for the Internet in Brazil which is going through the National Congress.
Fadi Chehadé was yesterday (Oct.7th) with Communications Minister Paulo
Bernardo, to ask for help from Brazil to start discussions about changes in
the governance of the Internet, and said that the arrangements should begin
this year. According to him, the need for a new governing body of the
Internet requires the involvement of multiple actors, not just the
"I understand that the internet has a new feature that requires active
participation by governments, their respective agencies within the United
Nations, but also in the context of users, civil society, the technicians,
who after all make the Internet work," Chehadé defended.
For the president of the corporation, academics and industrialists need to
participate in the debate, as they reflect on rights and carry out the
management of the Internet infrastructure.
The president of Icann said telecommunications companies must also attend
the conference."They are integral part of the family with which we must
work," he said. According to Paulo Bernardo, President Dilma agreed that
changes in network governance must occur multilaterally and with the
participation of all actors who engage the internet, and said that "we must
not allow economic, political and religious interests to interfere in the
free circulation of ideas." The minister said that the suggestion of the
president is that the event be held in April 2014 in Rio de Janeiro.

O Brasil vai sediar em 2014 o encontro para discutir as mudanças necessárias
para a governança da internet. Após se encontrar com o presidente da
Corporação da Internet para Atribuição de Nomes e Números (Icann, na sigla
em inglês), Fadi Chehadé, a presidenta Dilma Rousseff concordou em reunir
líderes globais de diferentes setores interessados no tema.
De acordo com Chehadé, o mundo conta com a liderança brasileira nesta
questão, depois que a Presidenta Dilma Rousseff discursou na abertura da 68ª
Assembleia Geral da ONU, ocorrida em setembro nos Estados Unidos. O mundo
ouviu a Presidenta brasileira, que falou com profunda convicção, com muita
coragem, e externou a frustração que muitas pessoas, em todo mundo, sentiam
com o fato de que a confiança havia sido quebrada que temos com relação à
internet, disse, revelando que o discurso de Dilma foi a motivação da sua
proposta para o encontro.
Chehadé citou as denúncias de espionagem envolvendo a comunicação de
autoridades e cidadãos brasileiros, dentre eles a própria presidenta, a
Petrobras e o Ministério de Minas e Energia. Vim solicitar à presidenta que
elevasse sua liderança a um novo nível, de modo a assegurar que todos
possamos nos reunir em torno de um novo modelo de governança, em que todos
sejamos iguais, afirmou. O presidente da Icann disse que as futuras
decisões sobre como os líderes poderão gerir a internet devem ter como base
os princípios do marco civil brasileiro, que tramita no Congresso Nacional.
Fadi Chehadé esteve anteontem (7) com o ministro das Comunicações, Paulo
Bernardo, a fim de pedir ajuda do Brasil para iniciar os debates sobre
mudanças na governança da internet, e disse que as articulações devem
começar este ano. Segundo ele, a necessidade de um novo órgão gestor da
internet passa pela participação de múltiplos atores, não só do governo.
Entendo que a internet tem um novo recurso, que exige participação ativa
por parte dos governos, dos seus respectivos órgãos no âmbito das Nações
Unidas, mas também no âmbito dos usuários, da sociedade civil, dos técnicos,
que afinal de contas fazem a internet funcionar, defendeu Chehadé. Para o
presidente da corporação, os acadêmicos e industriais precisam participar do
debate, pois refletem sobre o direito e fazem a gestão da infraestrutura da
O presidente da Icann disse que as empresas de telecomunicações devem também
participar da conferência. Elas são parte integrante da família com a qual
precisamos trabalhar, afirmou. Segundo Paulo Bernardo, a presidenta Dilma
concordou que as mudanças na governança da rede devem ocorrer de forma
multilateral e com a participação de todos os atores que se envolvem a
internet, e disse que não se pode permitir que interesses econômicos,
políticos e religiosos interfiram na livre circulação das ideias. O
ministro informou que a sugestão da presidenta é que o evento ocorra em
abril de 2014 no Rio de Janeiro.
