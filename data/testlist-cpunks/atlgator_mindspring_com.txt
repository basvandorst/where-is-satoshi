@_subject: Is there a lawyer in the house? :) 
On the lighter side (not to be taken seriously):
Q: What if Alice and Bob are siamese twins?
Could we imagine a constitutional test that turns on whether a majority of
organs are shared?  Could the dissent cite the fact that some of the shared
organs are not vital?
Q2:  Better yet, what if Alice and Bob were only 2 of say 6 distinct
personality manifestations exhibited by one physical person?  Again, would
we need to arrange for a consensus among at least 2 more personalities to
form a majority, thus entitling the collective to shared privacy?
The answers to these and other exciting questions on the next episode of "Exhaust that Thread."
