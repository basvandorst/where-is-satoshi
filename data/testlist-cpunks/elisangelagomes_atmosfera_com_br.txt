@_subject: I'm real...are you? 
Hi, Wilhelm
What a strange feeling
.:  We are so distant, you are so far away, but I still can feel that you are by my side
I even think that I feel you breathing, I might imagine the touch of your lips, hear your soft voice
  I think I like your voice very much, I dont know why, but I cant not like it, because I like everything about You!  When I close my eyes I try to imagine how you look like in real life and what your eyes are:  they are deep, they are endless, they are like night
  It is you, my Man.  Even if you are not with me right now, however the best and most pleasant thoughts and dreams give me faith and belief, I believe that we can be together
 will wait for you at  ... Only you and me ...
Olga S.
