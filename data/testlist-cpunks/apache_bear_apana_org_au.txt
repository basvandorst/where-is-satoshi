When satellite dish receive/broadcast services become common watch the scramble by telcos to update and offer cheap high speed links. Of course by then a lot of folks will just say fuck them. Here for your amusement are some sample prices offered by our very own blood sucking Telstra leech in our very own monopoly/oligopoly market (hard to say exactly what it is but there's no effective competition due to decades of government monopoly status:
All figures in Australian play money
Qoute from Toll$tra's web page: "Depending on your access speed, there is a low cost, flat monthly pricing for permanent modems or a two-tier price structure based on ussage for dedicated access ports pf 64 kbps and Then if you dig and I do mean *dig* around on Toll$tra's web page you will eventually come across the actual pricing data if your lucky (depending on how you look at it).
Well now I just went to their web site and behold; in their wisdom and in their position as a internet provider they have removed(!) the pricing information on the page. You now have to ring them (I just tried..no answer) or email them (tried that 4 hours ago no reply so far) so I'll just post from memory. These figures will be wrong but they give some Permanent modem 33.6 connection: about $400 per month (plus call costs)
ISDN 64k: about $1000 per month plus 19 cents/Mb for data received over about 25 percent usage
ISDN 128k: about $2000 per month plus usage as above
DDS/FRAME relay: Astronomical $$$$$$$$ per month plus usage per above.
Establishment fee for the above: $1000 - $2000
Upgrade fee from to a new level: Same as establishment fee
I note with great interest an independent provider in New Zealand which
has a better competitive market situation in this area than Australia
(and a lot of other things I might add) offers a user account with up to
500kbs satellite feed for $79 (NZ) /mnth flat plus installation of $79 plus you must by the satellite dish ($699). I would assume you can't resell bandwidth on this set up so the two are not directly comparable.
Oh yes and back to the topic, Telstra here trot out the same garbage as in the original post trying to justify timed local calls every year or so. Thus far they have been beaten...but only just. Technical solutions and a free market will be the only long term solutions, as we would

The first thing you would see after passing such a law (if indeed the original legislation itself didn't contain the provision) would be a requirement for identification of all accounts and account holders. Anonymous email and anonymous remailers would be the first victims.
Then there would be a license fee introduced to cover the costs of such a system (internet drivers license?), followed by calls for censorship which would now have much greater pseudo legitimacy. This would be only the crest of a very big wave. Spam is conveniently dealt with using procmail and other filtering tools. Admins generally will deal swiftly with denial of service attacks.

@_subject: PICS and intellectual freedom FAQ 
A link in the PICS FAQ that Declan posted was to The Net Labeling
Delusion. For anyone interested in the relationship of PICS/RASCi
and censorship I recommend reading this article in detail. It presents
a very interesting case for censorship by stealth and argues that since
blocking software will block unlabeled sites that mandatory-voluntary
labeling is unnecessary and unjustified. It also examines some
possible motives on the part of government for advocating such
mandatory-voluntary censorship schemes.
For the full text see :
     Here is a snip from the introduction..
Protection or Oppression
The developers of PICS say it's an infrastructure which facilitates
voluntary labelling  and selection of Internet content.  They promote
it as "Internet Access Controls  Without Censorship". Its advocates
say it's nothing to do with censorship and can't  assist the
censors. Meanwhile, PICS has achieved its original objective: to
provide an  alternative to government censorship legislation, that is,
to provide instead a  technological means of facilitating censorship. Governments, finally beginning to comprehend the difficulties of
blatantly censoring the Net, are becoming enthused about filtering
technology. Service providers, desperately hoping to place themselves
out of reach of over-zealous governments who would hold them liable
for material they carry, are demanding their customers rate and label
all their material. Ironically, an increasing number of the original proponents of
filtering software are becoming much less enthused as a host of new
issues arise. Filtering programs and labelling look set to become
privatised censorship disguised as consumer information backed by
government coercion. This document does not propose that PICS systems and third party
filtering software should be entirely black-banned by Net users. It
does, however, suggest that parents and other consumers should
ascertain what type of information is, and is not, being blocked and
that filtering advocates should be extremely cautious about
unreservedly promoting these systems as the saviour of the Net. Contents: What are filtering programs and rating/labelling systems?
Labelling has nothing to do with censorship, does it?    What is censorship?    What is labelling?    Labels are just tags, helpful information, surely?    Book in libraries are labelled, is there a difference?    Are book reviews similar to labels?    So, is labelling censorship or not? Is labelling likely to become compulsory? Will labelling protect children from harmful material? Do governments have a legitimate interest in enforcing, or encouraging,
labelling? Why would governments seek to enforce labelling?    The alleged reasons
   - To protect children
   - To enable electronic commerce to reach its full potential
   The other agenda
   - Censorship by Stealth: making publication too difficult, costly
   and risky
   - Banning access to the rest of the world
   - Facilitating future changes to censorship laws
   - Being seen to be doing something
How would governments enforce labelling?    Legislation    Coercion What's wrong with compulsory labelling anyway? What's wrong with the RSACi Rating System?
Voluntary labelling is a good idea, isn't it?
 Summary: Indications are mounting that labelling of all content will be made
mandatory in Australia.  Claims that all material, particularly material unsuitable for
children, must be labelled in order to protect children are
technologically ignorant at best, insidious at worst.
Unilateral action in Australia will increase costs in the burgeoning
on-line multimedia industry here, and may force many sites off-shore.
Compulsory labelling will restrict quantity and quality of information
as a result of:    the complexity, unsuitability and inadequacies of some, probably all,
   rating systems similar to RSACi    difficulties associated with lack of technical knowledge    overly cautious ratings because it is too much effort, or to avoid
   potential complaints, or to purposely seek to undermine an enforced
   system    lack of time and/or staff to rate material    financial restraints    unwillingness to enter into complex legal agreements with ratings
   organisations    unwillingness to provide personal information to ratings organisations
   which can be used for, or sold to, mailing lists etc. Compulsory labelling will force content providers to:    self-censor in accord with someone else's value system    place themselves at greater risk of complaints regarding legal material
   because of the many shades of grey inherent in rating systems.
Compulsory labelling enables governments to achieve censorship by
stealth as well as facilitate future more censorious laws whilst
claiming non-censorious intent.
Compulsory labelling achieved by government coercion of private
enterprise enables government to avoid all responsibility and
criticism for resultant problems and difficulties.
Voluntary labelling of material which is suitable and intended for
children will provide a child-safe environment.
Rating services have the potential to influence community views and
attitudes to a greater extent than either existing broadcast media or
uncensored access to the Internet.  Rating organisations must be required to publicly disclose concise
details of rating criteria and value systems to ensure consumers can
ascertain what is, or is not, blocked.

Tim May said:
In more controlled countries such as Australia which has no
constitutional protections to slow down the removal of individual
freedoms and rights (I won't go into discussion here that we actually
do have such protections inhereted from ancient British law dating
from first settlement, and in any case such arguments are ignored by
the government goons) the scenario is already common and perhaps even
the norm.
Here in Australia this bargaining process has been pre-empted by the
traitors in parliament and in the recent report which mandates
"voluntary" labeling they give you a possible out to charges of having
rude pics, unsuitable language or whatever is the flavour of the week,
passing through your server specified in their version of a voluntary
(mandatory) code. As Irene states in her excellent page on the subject
"Draft legislative proposals have suggested content providers may have
a defense against provision of restricted material to minors by taking
reasonable steps to prevent availability of same. It has been
intimated that labeling may a defense of good intent and content
providers may label material in the hope of having a defense. In fact,
in terms of labeling, a clearer indication of good intent would be
not to label material, thus ensuring it was not made available to
those using properly configured filtering software." Many service providers, attempting to stay afloat here, already have
such editing/age and other limits. Here is an extract of the first ISP
contract I examined after reading your post (these conditions appear
to be fairly standard) - Note especially cl4.2 prohibiting access to
"offensive" material which is not defined and would on the face of it
encompass any material, not just rude pictures, that may be offensive
to..well to who knows..:
[See:  and note the proudly displayed "We rated
with RSACi" logo on the lead page."
"4. Compliance with Laws and other Conditions of Use  4.1 The Subscriber acknowledges that use of the Data, Databases,
System and Services may from time to time be subject to certain legal
regulations, conditions (including any license conditions) and
restrictions. The Subscriber shall ascertain and comply with such
regulations, conditions (including any license conditions) or
restrictions including but not limited to those laid down by the
Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth).   4.2 Without limiting clause 4.1, the Subscriber and each User shall
not send, access or download any Data which is offensive, defamatory
or which to the Subscriber's or User's knowledge contains any computer
virus or has not been classified or approved in accordance with any
applicable censorship or other laws.   4.3 Without limiting clause 4.1, the Subscriber and each User shall
not, without proper authorisation, use the System or Services to gain
access to information in a restricted access computer system or to use
a restricted access computer system, or use the System or Services to
contribute to or aid the commission of a crime or to infringe the
rights of a third party."
Furthermore a duty is placed on the _subscriber_ to notify the
provider of the existence of certain material, including the existence
of "offensive" material, computer virii etc. Failure to so notify the
provider may cause you problems if a later search of your hardware or
a search of the providers temp files reveals you accessed such
information. No consulting fees are provided for in the agreement for
the subscribers time and expense providing such valuable data:
"8.1 The Subscriber shall notify the Company immediately upon becoming
aware of: any infringement of any third party's intellectual property
rights as a result of information being made available on a Database
or by use of the System or Services, the existence of any data, code,
program or other material of the kind referred to in clause 4.2 or any
use of the System or Software (by the Subscriber or any other person)
which may infringe clause 4.3."
It would be an interesting exercise to take out an account and
actually "immediately notify the Company" of such material. In just a
few hours of work a flood of material could be presented meeting such
a lose definition. Indeed a scan of my netscape cache for the last
couple of weeks would probably be enough to get me a free trip
downtown to visit the local goons with expensive court proceedings
required to attempt to avoid criminal sanctions for rather innocuous
web browsing habits. For an example where there was no evidence at all
against the subscriber but the cops performed a dawn raid on an
unsuspecting student (who was 14 months later found completely
innocent) based on the word of the ISP who was actively browsing
temporary files on the ISP's computer see:
 It appears now
the student, who suffered immense financial as well as emotional
strain was merely a 'test case' to see how the new (a mere few days
old) net censorship laws would work. No doubt his sacrifice was for
the greater good of us all and to protect the leetle chiiiildren.
What amazes me is the time and money the traitors are prepared to
invest in attempting to prosecute such harmless activity performed in
one's own home. The fact that they are willing to do this indicates
the level of threat we all face from this scum and the level of
response that will be called for to surgically remove this cancer from
our respective countries. The threat in this country is far greater
than many might suspect in other jurisdictions as we are not schooled
in the writings of revolutionaries and early American presidents and
have no national psychosis of revolt nor any constitutional
guarantees (I know even these in the US are being subverted or
attacked but without them it's pretty grim). As can be seen from the
contract already referred to corporations are only too willing to lick
the rim the feeds them as they see no financial gain in attempting to
go against the flow. Indeed such a corporation would, with monopoly
control of telecommunications in Australia, quickly find itself
The only conclusion I can draw is that our government and their
bedmates are very worried that people, through the internet, have the
ability to say (for now but not for long) what they wish about that
government, about anything and get that message out to many people
almost instantaneously. This must be of great concern to control
freaks and those who steal money and other assets with force. It has
always been that way.
Howard Rheingold states in Democracy is About Communication:
"The threat of uncontrollable communications among citizens, not the
pornographic pictures or taboo words that a tiny portion of the online
population publish, is why freedom of expression is under attack.
'Decency' is a smokescreen. It's about power." and "Communication is
Political": "Porno on the Net is a sideshow. The main event, taking
place far from the spotlight, is about who will control and profit
from the new industry that network communication technology makes
Clearly in Australia the bureaucrats at the ABA hope to be a key body
to write their own ticket in this, to them, brave new world. The utter
cluelessness of the government and the ABA can be seen in an earlier
report released in 1996 which is good reading for a laugh where the
ABA clearly has difficulty coming to terms with the difference between
BBS, which until recently was the bogey man the government focused
on, and the net. See: Report on the Investigation into the Content of
On-Line Services dated 30 June 1996 On age limits:
"14.3 The Subscriber must be a legal person. Any minor seeking access
must do so as a User of a Subscriber's account.  Supervision of such a
User shall be the responsibility of a Parent or Guardian of the minor."
Of course if the parent in question was supervising the minor then the
proposed censorship laws about to go before parliament that will limit
the ability of Australian _adults_ to access information would not be
required (I liked a previous description of this concept in another
article which described it as an "infantocracy").
"You have the rights antecedent to all earthly governments; rights that
cannot be repealed or restrained by human laws; rights derived from the
Great Legislator of the Universe."

Howard moves to censor secrets
By defence writer DON GREENLEES
September 15: The Federal Government is renewing efforts to protect
national defence and intelligence secrets under a revived system of
media censorship.
Cabinet's National Security Committee decided early this month to
start talks with media executives on voluntary censorship and backed
away from threats by the former government to impose $1 million
($US723,000) fines over publication of official secrets.
But the Government will put the onus on the media to make voluntary
censorship work or ultimately face legislation that would impose huge
fines for disclosure of sensitive military and intelligence
It comes almost two years after the Labor government reached an
impasse with media executives over a proposal for a "voluntary" system
backed by $1 million fines for a prohibited broadcast or publication.
The move followed revelations by disaffected former Australian Secret
Intelligence Service agents of spying operations and about the bugging
by Australian intelligence of foreign embassies, including China's and
Senior sources said the six-member Cabinet security committee, chaired
by John Howard, had decided to take a more conciliatory line than the
former government by first trying a genuinely voluntary system to
maximise the chances of winning media agreement.

  >>   >> And, given these problems with Markey-White, why is the CDT/VTW

  >>   >> If a legislator wanted to vote for Internet freedom and reject
  >> deviant bills, he should have voted against Oxley, Markey-White,

  >>   >> Go figure.
