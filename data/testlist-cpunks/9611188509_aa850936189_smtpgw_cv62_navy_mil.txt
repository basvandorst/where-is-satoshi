@_subject: Maybe the CypherPunks *do* have some heart 
------------------ Begin Forwarded Message Text ---------------------  The Houghton-Mifflin Publishing Co.. is giving books to children's  hospitals; how many books they give depends on how many emails they  receive from people around the world.  For every 25 emails they  receive, they give one book -- it seems like a great way to  help a good cause. All you have to do is mail:     share at hmco.com.  Hope you can spare some time to write and then let your friends know.  ------------------- End Forwarded Message Text ----------------------  Hey cypherpunks, just thought this might be of interest, forgive the  spam, but remember, knowledge begins with reading.  And no, don't go   e-mail and ask what books the Co. is donating (i.e.. gov't supportive,  procrypto controls etc etc) Its the Holidays, have some heart.  And  hey - if the number of books is related to the number of e-mails, i  wonder if maybe we can enlist those "i'm sorry" spammers to fill those  e-mail boxes .  Happy .   ---------------------- SUCRUM22 at cv62.navy.mil -----------------------  Don't confuse my views with those of the DoD or the United States Navy
