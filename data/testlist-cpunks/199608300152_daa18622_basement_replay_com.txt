I assume you are talking about a nym.alias.net account, and that the
problem is when you want to sign a message with a key other than your
nym key?
Add a line like this
to the file $HOME/.pgp/config.txt.  (Or wherever the equivalent is
under DOS.  Perhaps someone can tell me where the config.txt file
lives under DOS and I will add that to the help file.)
