could help in decrypted information picked up with a scanner. It seems
that a bunch of people trying to defend their home from the feds were
listening in on the feds radio communications, but now they're
encrypting stuff. It's probably not very strong crypto, maybe just a
simple XOR.

make/destroy OTPs. (And by the time the price *does* go down that far,
I should have the money to buy it, hopefully.)

the POPs outside the bay area only have 56K connections to the netcom

an *excellent* public access network site in Chicago, estimated these

I've been with the guy for multiple years, so there's a level of bias

key exchange for the IRC. I was hoping to incorporate it into the
source, and implement it via /dcc, but that's too tough. I've figured
out a scheme which will work, but I don't know how to implement it in
irc.. I'm wondering if anyone here knows how to do what I want--
probably grab one from someplace.. or leech off the ~/pgp/randseed.bin
In irc, I do /startdh Alice
What startdh does is call
and outputs to stdout, YB.
to alice, as a /ctcp send of type "dh-key"
When Alice receives the
irc automatically should call:
do /encrypt Sameer . (The standard encryption routine in irc is
insecure, but there's a facility for an external crypt program..)
When I receive the
irc automatically should call
grab the XB from that file, and then compute a key, which it returns.
it do /encrypt Alice  where  is the output from ircdh Alice
help with the interface with irc. Any ircII wizards out there? Thanks.
