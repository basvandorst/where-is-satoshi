@_subject: [p2p-hackers] Nash equilibrium on p2p networks 
If you consider a cluster of Sybils, the creator of the Sybils is free
to create any structure of IOUs within the cluster, and any structure of
IOUs from Sybils to non-Sybils. But IOUs from non-Sybils to Sybils can
only be created by non-Sybils, and that only happens when the Sybils
provide a service.
No matter how many Sybils a person creates, the total debt owed to them
by non-Sybils is limited by the total amount of service they provide. So
there's no advantage in creating Sybils. It's not impossible - it's just
I think that's how it works, anyway - it's been a while since I read the
paper and I could be confusing it with the Sybilproof reputation
mechanisms paper Matteo mentioned.
