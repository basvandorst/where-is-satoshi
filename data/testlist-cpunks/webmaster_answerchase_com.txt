Intelligence Monitoring Training Course
August 17, 2001, Open (limited seats)
September 21, 2001, Open
October 19, 2001, TBA
This course will assist you to plan and implement Intelligence Monitoring (IM) technology in your organization. IM technology harvests Web content to help you discover hidden knowledge about your enemies, competitors, suppliers, creditors, investors, market trends, customers, clients, personnel, corporate visibility, and even about your own reputation.
A new breed of IM software based on advanced language processing technology is now changing the IM landscape from "monitoring news clips by keywords" to "detecting intelligence by questions", a step closer to how IM professionals do the job themselves.
