@_subject: [liberationtech] Cryptoparty in Los Altos, California 
The Los Altos Library is letting us offer a Cryptoparty for the general
public in a big room with sunlight and wifi on Sunday, May 19, 2013,
from 1 pm to 3 pm at 13 South San Antonio Road, Los Altos, California.
We hope that our team of teenage volunteer teachers will come again,
after their brilliant work at the Cryptoparty on the Stanford University
campus on February 24, 2013.
We are covering very basic topics: strong passwords, Https Everywhere,
DuckDuckGo and Startpage, ad blockers, Cryptocat, Truecrypt, PGP email
with Thunderbird, and Tor.
Come if you like, to teach or learn.
