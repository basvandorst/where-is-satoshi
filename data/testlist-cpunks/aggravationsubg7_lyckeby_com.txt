feeling so inspired
we lived on a corner in a typical oc tract neighborhood what do you look for in a best friend
and then that got me thinking that really its not just while laying in bed that she is watching out for me what an adventure it is
dinner i kind of snack or have a lunch type meal again dinner is tricky because i still need to prepare dinner for my family so i do but im not super hungry at night so i just eat whatever broccoli a little of what theyre having or snacky stuff or chicken wings or crispy thin crust pizza but i always end the day with a low carb ice cream bar
at 18 i planned to live the tahoe hippie life forever one day i felt compelled i knew it i just had to leave i packed up my car and moved to the central coast and then i found myself a mother funny i thought id teach awhile longer and have grant all to myself and save some money remember when the weather was warm and we would go to the park when daddy got home from work and we would bring homemade bread and fruit to eat for dinner and we would be drenched in golden light and the cousins would come meet us for some wild rides down the slide cate did you love disney games on the computer when you were five
one thing i enjoy about facebook is the old pictures that friends and fam upload to walk down memory lane together with you from brora
what a few hours on a sunny day can do for you
ten months after we were married i was a stay at home mom living the student life again while grant went back to school a few months later another unplanned event- my mom passed away suddenly secondly i must say i know carbohydrates arent bad i know bread is life and wheat is the staff of life a lot of fruits and veggies are quite sugary/ starchy for almost everyone eating all these foods in moderation will do them fine but remember i am trying to regulate an abnormality to a diabetic sugar is the devil to someone with celiac disease wheat is the devil to someone with milk allergies dairy is the devel and what ive come to believe that for some women who dont ovulate high blood sugar may be their devil and it definately is mine
it made me happy
let me explain Buoy
cate and i went through some of the free options around the web for valentines to download and print say hi to gilbert and the kids with love km
