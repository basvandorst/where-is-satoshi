Anybody give me a hint how this feature works as
I need it to sign from a batch job under windows.
And yes I read the man and pdf file, but I´m not
sure what file discriptor means. I thought it to be
a filename containing the password?
Met vriendelijke groeten,
Kind regards

@_subject: Import Problems with RSA keypair 
I'm trying to import my 6.5.8 freeware PGP keys into
GPG and most of them are succesfully imported.
One keypair gives me trouble though.
Its an RSA keypair of size 1073
On importing GPG elaborates:
gpg: key BC592A7D: already in secret keyring
gpg: key BC592A7D: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 2
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
gpg:  secret keys unchanged: 1
So obviously the secret key is imported but the public key
not. I have it signed with it's own key but nothing
changes in GPG's behaviour. Is it the size that gives the

@_subject: piping output 
Hi guy's,
Probably another windumb question, but trying to pipe the output
of a verify command like:
gpg --verify file > output.txt
didnt work. Im using the windows version gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.4-1.
So how would I do this? Worked fine with pgp and I need it to
convert some scripts.
