The following patch to GNU GPG 1.0.6 allows it to be compiled under
Apple's Darwin OS for PowerPC (aka Mac OS X.)
The patch does three significant things:
1) Teaches 'configure' to recognize the nm output syntax for Darwin
2) Teaches 'mpi/config.links' of the Apple PowerPC assembler syntax
3) Patches the mpi/powerpc32 assembly files to support the Apple PowerPC
   assembler.
Please feel free to integrate this patch into the GPG tree.
