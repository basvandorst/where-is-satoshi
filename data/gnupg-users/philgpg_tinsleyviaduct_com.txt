@_subject: Wildcards in uids? 
I have recently started using suffixed e-mail addresses and am  wondering if I might need to add suffixes I am using to my key - or if  I can add something that would catch them all.
If I need to add them individually, it may be better to add the ones I  need to as I need them, but if a catch-all is possible, please advise  me as to how I need to specify it.

I think you may have misunderstood the query.
I use suffixed e-mail addresses - I introduced them to help me sort mail
as well as spot the leaky organisations. That part is absolutely
However, do I need to add these addresses as uids to my key if I wish to
sign or encrypt mail where I am using them as From: addresses?
Is a "catch all suffixes" uid possible if that is the case? If so, how do
I specify it? It is nothing, as far as I can see, to do with my mail
programs (either of them). It is more to do with key administration.
If not, presumably I simply sign/decrypt using my existing key?

Should I wish to sign, or should somebody wish to send me something
encrypted, to some address with a suffix, my key will need a uid
containing that suffix, as far as I can see.
Therefore, should it prove necessary, I will presumably have to add such
uids as necessary to the key.
On the whole, I think this will probably only rarely, if ever, be
needed. But, if it is, at least I know now.

@_subject: Someone has harvested my address 
I kept this email address specifically for use for my postings on, and
to help me sort postings from, this list.
It seems that somebody has harvested this address, as I received an
off-list spam to it.
Is anyone responsible for the administration of this list interested in
details, or shall I just change this address?

Quoting "Bill Royds" :

Yes, that was another thing I knew could happen. It just strikes me as a little strange that this one was the first hit.
