@_subject: OT: GPG or OpenSSL? 
I want to create signatures for (free) stuff I distribute. As far as I have been able to understand, I can do that with OpenSSL (though how the process with OpenSSL should work is not clear to me yet, especially the OpenSSL equivalent of GPG/PGP's wwwkeys.[country].pgp.net).
Could people in the know on this list explain the (dis)advantages of both systems? Or am I completely misunderstanding the nature of openssl?

@_subject: GPG without any local files? 
Is it possible to run gpg for verifying a signature, but without a homedir, options file, pubring.pgp, etc? Ideally I was thinking about having gpg get the key from a server (it's trust will of course be zero) and use that for verifying a detached sig. Currently I can do that by creating a temporary homedir in /tmp with an empty options file (and a pubring is created there), but I would prefer if gpg would do everything in memory.
