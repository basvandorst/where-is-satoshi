@_subject: no info to calculate a trust probability 
I'm kind of new to pgp/gpg in general.  Basically I have a key that gets
distributed with some machines.  I use it with some system info collection
scripts.  When I use gpg, I get this message:
gpg: 35993E30: no info to calculate a trust probability
I'm curious what I need to do to resolve this.  Sorry if this is an
FAQ.  I didn't actually see an FAQ anywhere.
