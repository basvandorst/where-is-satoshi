Hi, I have a sparc station running NetBSD 1.4.2 and got the same error. I had
to leave out the configure-option '--enable-m-guard' and then it worked
fine. HTH.

@_subject: using a revocation certificate 
Hi, You have to apply revoke.asc first to your keyring $ gpg --import revoke.asc
and then send the modified key to the keyserver. $ gpg --send-key 0x{your-key-id}
Well, you can't really get it out of the keyserver. (This would need manual intervention to the database, and you could never be sure that another person is not adding it again.) But to get a revoked version to the keyservers, use the procedure as described above. Regards,
