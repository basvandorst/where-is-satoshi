As far as I can remember, there was here a reply not far away about the s=
question. I will try to sum up what was said.
Basically, what you need is that your user name owns the folder gnupg and=
 its
files. Secondly, the permissions set on it must be 700 on the folders and=
 600
on the files. You won't get that message any more.
And it is a lot safer that only your user can read these files rather tha=
everybody !
