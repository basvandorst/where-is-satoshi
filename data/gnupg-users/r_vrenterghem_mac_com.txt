@_subject: After installing the new release. 
I am sorry to ask one question that could be a bit silly for an expert like you...
I have installed GnuPG 1.4.1 like an angel, but I am little worry about Do I need to revoke my previous key, generate new one and then publish it to the key server with this release?
Many thanks,
