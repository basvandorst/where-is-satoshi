Incredibly  powerful  and  sexy integration with the Windows GUI! Big up

Simple  and  trivial perhaps, but insert an additional '&' preceding the
character  in  the  selection  title  you want to become hotkey for that
context menu selection. As follows:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\GPG &encrypt and sign with some
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\GPG &decrypt and verify (to file.out)
Even faster!
