@_subject: Large files on Windows 2000 
Please excuse me but I am a newbie to GnuPG, (and encryption in general)
but I wonder if anyone else has had problems decrypting big ( 4-6 gig)
files on Windows 2000. I have made smaller files work fine but no luck with the big ones.  I am encryting with default DES/AL GIMAL 1024. The
content is mpeg2 files. Encryting seems to go fine, and starts to
but bails after a while.
BTW- If I use symmetric (-c) option, it works. Not quite the level of
protection I am looking for though ;0)
Thanks for any help.
