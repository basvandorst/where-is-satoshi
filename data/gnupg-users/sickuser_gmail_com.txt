@_subject: No public key to verify signature 
I run debian etch and kmail is my mail application.
All mail i get signed by gnupg coming from mailing lists , has this error:
"Message was signed on 2008-06-03 14:15 with unknown key 0x123456789ABCDFGH.
The validity of the signature cannot be verified.
Status: No public key to verify the signature"
It doesn't happen with other mail coming from my contacts or friends i was wondering what it was due this error , thanks

@_subject: Linux crypto killer apllication 
Mine is just a suggestion to improve our dear gnupg.
What is missing in linux is a killer crypt application .
I recently used two windows application pgp and bestcrypt . And they both have , disk encryption , mail encryption , key generator up to 8192 length , text encryption , zip encryption . All these features are for linux from command line or together to other command line softwares and not really friendly for newbyes  .
Will be any , of the above said features , implemented in gnupg in the future ?
Thanks !

@_subject: old default options file 
Hi list ,
after kgpg installation whatever gpg command i launch i get this error:
gabrix at mail:~$ gpg --version
gpg: NOTE: old default options file `/home/gabrix/.gnupg/options' ignored
I know it's not a major problem but anyway the error is annoying , to what option does it refer ?

I don't know the hit parade but cryptography is important to me .
Also debian and many other , too OK !
Posix  application maybe !
And if it is an alias ?
