Issue 1:
While looking into signing my e-mails through MS Outlook for work, I
found the GnuPG Plugin. I've just tested it and it is signing. I noted a curious thing though:
When I use mutt and sign an e-mail and send it to my outlook inbox,
Outlook seems to detect it is a signed e-mail and flags this by showing
a "signed" icon. I also find an attached .dat file. I notice the headers
show some relevant info which may flag this.
When I use the GnuPG plugin on Outlook and e-mail myself, I don't get this "flag" or icon on my e-mail, nor any attached document or even any
special headers.
What gives?
Issue 2:
More of a question. MS Outlook has a "Digital IDs" Section, under
Tools --> Options --> Security. There you can "import/export" Ids. I notice that the file types it allows by defaut are :
Security Information (*.epf, *.pfx, *.p12)
Are these "secret" keys in a *special* format? I exported my gpg
key and tried to import it using this import utility and it failed.
I also googled around but didn't find anything.

OK that's it. Replacement lookup time. 8) This is a good enough
"official" reason for me. Anyone know good Outlook replacement for
windows *with PGP/MIME support? Some initial google'ing shows Enigmail but they're currently working on that site...
Aw, Shucks...
Well go figure, MS doesn't say much either. After your e-mail I was able
to retrieve some nice keywords to enhance my googling and found the
following correspondance:
.p12:	PKCS S/MIME certificate
.pfx:	predecessor to PKCS
.epf:	I'm not sure
And then from the OpenSSL PKCS FAQ v1.83:
Q. What is PKCS A. PKCS is a standard for storing private keys and certificates
securely (well sort of). It is used in (among other things) Netscape and
Microsoft Internet Explorer with their import and export options. Q. What about PFX is it the same as PKCS or what? A. PFX in its correct form is an almost unused predecessor to PKCS
Occasionally people incorrectly use the term "PFX" when they mean
Q. Why should I use PKCS A. Other than the obvious reason that you want PKCS :-) It's probably
the easiest way to generate your own certificates for MSIE and NS. You
don't need a separate server and you can add them simply by importing a
file. It is also the only way to access the private keys of other
certificates (e.g. issued by a standard CA). So it seems these are SSL "client" certificates for browsers. I guess
you then that they are also used for signing mail too...
I see. I'm new to gpg so I'm wondering, is there a possible
correspondance between public keys and these ssl certs (I think they are ssl
Or is this like comparing apples and orranges?

I believe you have confused the identify tags (.vfc) allowed by Outlook
and the certs we're discussing. Outlook allows you to try to "create"
your own certificate and guess what happens when you try? No, sorry, it doesn't just ask you for an e-mail, and your name.. It
brings you to a page where you can *purchase* a certificate. Among the
companies listed is VeriSign. The .vfc (vCard File) files just seem to be another bad idea by MS to bloat e-mail traffic with uncessary/unwanted attachments just to allow
recipients to view a sender's detailed contact info (mind you,
sometimes there are just empty).

@_subject: PGP/MIME corrupting Exchange server mailboxes? 
I PGP/MIME sign my e-mails at work and our mail server is an Exchange
Server. Now some mailboxes are being moved from one mailstore to another
and apparantly a lot of errors are popping up in logs when this is done.
It seems a lot of my e-mails come up as corrupt. This is only happening
for the e-mail I have sent to peers at work. The only thing I can think
of as the root cause is that I am the only person who PGP/MIME signs my
Now, according to the Official Internet Protocol Standards [1], RFC 2015 is
already an accepted standard. I am still wondering if anyone knows if data corruption can occur or has occurred before on mail servers for
PGP/MIME signed e-mails.
The error that pops up looks as follows:

only thing relevant I can find is a problem with exchange on "use of quotation mark (") character in name of storage group using Exchange Management Object" [2] -- whater the hell this means.
Any feedback would be welcomed. [1] [2]
