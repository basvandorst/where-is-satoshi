@_subject: non ascii characters in key name 
I am using GnuPG v1.2.4 on Windows 2000. Some users send me keys where name contains non ascii
characters. It is ok in PGP, but in GnuPG, when I use --list-keys I have something like this:
pub  1024D/308A940E 2003-07-08 \xce\xc8\xd2\x20\xcf\xf0\xee\xf2\xe5\xea-33 Is it possible to view such key names in readable form?

@_subject: extensions of files when decrypting 
Sometimes users encrypt files sent to me like 'file.zip' to 'file.pgp'
When I decrypt it using PGP, it recovers .zip extension back,
but when I decrypt it with GnuPG it makes just 'file'.
I don't find any option to fix it. Does it exist? And if not
can it be added?

@_subject: Using passphase-fd from within a batch procedure 
I think it would be something like
"echo %1 |  gpg --output Compressed\testfile1.txt --batch --passphrase-fd 0 --decrypt testfile1.gpg"

@_subject: Using passphase-fd from within a batch procedure 
Yes this is really so, I didn't check my example before sending. It should be:
'echo %1| gpg ...'
without space after %1

@_subject: retrieving keys over a proxy 
Is it possible to specify http proxy username and password for getting keys over a proxy?
I've tried to set http_proxy environment variable to
But it gives me following error:
gpg: ekot: host not found: ec=11001
gpg: can't get key from keyserver: No such file or directory
gpg: Total number processed: 0

I've set it, but as I've said it gives me error, gpg assumes that username part of http_proxy is proxy address.

@_subject: Share group aliases between GnuPG and PGP? 
In our organization there is an opposite situation - most of people use PGP, so I made scripts that automatically imports groups/keys from PGP to GnuPG. You can take it here:
It is written in JScript for WSH, so it is Windows only.
