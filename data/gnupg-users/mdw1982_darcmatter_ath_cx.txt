Hi list,
I've got GnuPG setup on a Mandrake Linux box and I'm using Pgpenvelope to
interface with Pine. I've got the same setup on my Linux box at home and
everything works great there, but the same setup on this box here at work
doesn't. pgpenvelope and gnupg are supposed to decrypt on the fly the
email message once the passphrase is given, but it doesn't seem to be
working on this machine.
All the PERL modules that are required by pgpenvelope have been
successfully installed on the machine. In fact, the setup on this machine
is almost identical to the setup on my home machine.
might anyone have any idea as to why gnupg is not decrypting the messages?

please excuse my stupidity. I found the trouble with the messages not
getting decrypted. I didn't have the "display-filters" defined correctly
in Pine.

I've found that Pgpenvelope/Pine/Gnupg is a very good combination. Once
they're setup they work seamlessly together with very little hassle

Thanks for the response. I figured out what it was. I didn't have the path
to the pgpenvelope binary referenced correctly in Pine.

As a matter of fact I've put together a package that includes an install
script AND the PERL modules needed as well as Gnupgp-1.0.6, Gpa-0.4.1,
Pgpenvelope-2.10.2 that all works with Pine beautifully. I can't say what
the result would be on anything other then a Linux Mandrake machine, but
it worked great on my machine at home, and I'm going to be testing it on
the workstation/server here at work today.
If anyone else would like to give it a try email me and let me know and
I'll give them the address of the server where they can download it from.
It was designed to work only with Pine, so I can't do anything about this
stuff for anyone using Elm, or Mutt. The Pgpenvelope module, which is what
makes this whole thing possible was designed to work with Pine as far as I
know. And it does quite nicely. All I've done is gathered together
everything needed to install the whole setup, wrote an install script that
will automate the process and written some simple install instructions.
It'd be really nice if someone could give this a try running Redhat or
something else. (linux)
