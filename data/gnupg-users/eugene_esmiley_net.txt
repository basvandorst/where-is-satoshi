The people who use the arguement that inline-PGP is deprecated or that
a MUA that supports inlined and not PGP/MIME is broken are spouting
nonsense. It's a matter of the lowest common denominator, which is
inlined-PGP. More clients support inlined-PGP than PGP/MIME.
Once the balance shifts to PGP/MIME, then they can say what they want,
but with Microsoft's MAUs being used on more desktops, either the
community causes them to get updated or the community gets them replaced.
Now don't get me wrong. I think PGP/MIME is the bomb, but for those
with MAU's that aren't PGP/MIME compatible verifying the sig is a
royal pain (as compared to verifying inlined).

I'd think this could be a simple script. Start with a login page that

script runs gpg (or gpgv) to verify the signature on the contents of
the textbox. Extract the email address for the login ID[2]. Drop your
info into a session cookie to keep the state as the user surfs your site.
No problems with firewalls, Kerberos, or SSH. Keys would only need to
be passed or retrieved from a keyserver once (unless you already have
the key). Use it for the entire site or by individual page. Your choice.

Your school UID has 23 signatures plus a self-sig.
Your other  UID has  6 signatures plus a self-sig.
They share 4 signatures. In other words, 19 people signed UID  2
people signed UID  and 4 people signed both.
What David is saying is that if you revoke the school UID, it doesn't
matter to the 4 who have signed both keys or the 2 people who have
signed UID "If the person only signed one user ID, and you revoke that one, then
the chain stops that that point." Meaning that the signatures from the
19 people that haven't signed UID  are no longer valid.
The solution is to have those 19 people sign the new UID. They then
have access to the chain of signatures you are at the beginning of.

Hash: SHA1
Below is an edited/expanded version of the answer that atom gives. I
recommend that it be addded as 3.1.2 The use of Role keys and Managing
User IDs for the Handbook.
There are two distinct ways of looking a Role keys. the first way to
look at role keys is that they are keys used by an entity a) for the
public to communicate securely with personnel filling particular roles
(network administrator, keymaster, list administrator, key revoker,
etc.), and b) for these personnel to certify important digital
documents. These keys are generally signed by a root key to designate
that the entity considers the key valid.
The alternative view of roles is at the individual user level. A user
may designate roles of related functions/User IDs. Bob might designate
a Work Role with UIDs of bob and webmaster and
a Personal role of bob These two roles would be created
as two seperate keys. Bob might even consider having a class of email
addresses without keys such as bob and bob Or
Bob could have one key with any or all of the five User IDs.
Adding User IDs on a key is convenient when you use multiple names or
email addresses which do not socially conflict with each other. For
example, Alice (alice works with Bob, and is an alumni of
a university (alice and is a member of a trade
association (alice She wants the trust and "prestige" of
each of these organizations to be shared by the others. To do the same
thing with seperate keys would require everyone to sign 3 keys instead
of 3 User IDs.
However, co-worker Charlie (charlie might be the
webmaster at Example-sucks.com and might lose his job if someone found
out. It would be a good idea if Charlie kept these two identities
seperate and distinct. Charlie SHOULD have seperate keys/roles for
these two (Work and Activist).
Additional key pairs can be created the same way as your first key
pair, with --gen-key. When encrypting or signing, use the --local-user
option to specify an ID other than the default.

Have you recently "clean out" your public keyring by deleting any

to be used to check signatures.
It may also be the case that your public keyring was corrupted. GPG

It does make sense. It is possible that the vendor has changed keys.
If you have "keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve" in your gpg.conf and
the vendor has uploaded the key to the keyservers, gpg should retrieve
the key. If you find that this option is in your gpg.conf, then the
vendor hasn't uploaded the key and you'll need to get it from them
The key is already ineffective. The vendor has signed the file using
their secret key which you try to verify the authenticity of using
their public key. If the signature doesn't validate, anyone could be
sending the files. These untrusted files should net be processed
further without resolving this issue.

You signed your message using PGP/MIME which neither Outlook nor

You will find that the number of people who use an email program that

There are several free S/MIME certificate sites. Thawte and CACert
offer free certificates. A fee only comes in if you can't find a local
"notary" to assure your identity. Granted Thawte was bought by
Verisign several years ago.
It's also possible to create certificates using OpenSSL, but they
won't be automatically trusted unless the root certificate is also
imported into Outlook / IE / Mozilla / .

You make a good point, but if you use fake addresses you can neither
expect anonymity nor for your message to get delivered. Some MTAs
insert a header . Some recipients choose to delete
emails with faked To: and From: headers...
