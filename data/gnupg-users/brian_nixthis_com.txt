@_subject: GPG question 
I need to decrypt a file that has been sent to me and immediately re-encrypt the file for three new recipients.  I would like to automate the process with a batch file.  To avoid the file being left un-encrypted during the batch process I would like to redirect the output of the decrypt command into the encrypt command for the new I have been unsuccessful in my attempts, can anyone help me out?
Thanks Brian

Thanks so much, it worked like a charm.  I just had to change "cat" to I don't mind supplying the passphrase in the script or in a file if there is a way to automate this process.  I am not sure where a "--passphrase-fd" could be used, if it is even  possible.
Thanks Brian

I have been trying to automate the pass phrase for the first GPG instance below.  Is it possible with this string and if so where would I add the command?  Sorry if this is a dumb question, I am just getting started trying to script using GPG.

Thanks guys for all of the information.  Unfortunately I am being asked to automate this entire process so the passphrase must be included.  We will definitely be doing everything in our power to avoid exposing the Thanks again

Is it possible with GPG to take the public keys of three or more users and merge them into a single key?  The single key could then be used to encrypt a file that all three or more recipients could read using their respective private key.
Thanks Brian

A vendor will be encrypting files for us and making them available via FTP.  We have three users that will decrypt the files at different times.  The vendor will not accept more than one key from us and we wanted each of our users to have their own key for security and auditing purposes down the line.

We have decided to decrypt using a "special" user and re-encrypt the file to multiple users.  Our concern is that unless we want to do this manually it has to be scripted and that will require the "special" user's passphrase to live in the script or on a server in plaintext.  No one in IS wants to add this to their daily responsibilities and we really should not have access to the data anyway as it is meant for our finance department.

I started to read up on subkeys but did not understand them enough to know if they did what we needed.  I will take another look.

I am using something like this.
gpg --passphrase-fd 0 -o "New File" -d "File Name.gpg" Hi Johan,
