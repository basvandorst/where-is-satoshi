@_subject: Message was not integrity protected 
Hash: SHA1
I've recently updated my copy of GPG to version 1.1.91 for Windows
I've noticed that now whenever I decrypt an encrypted file stored on
my computer I get the following warning:
"gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected"
I was wondering is there anyway to remove this warning other than
adding the option "no-mdc-warning" to my options file?
