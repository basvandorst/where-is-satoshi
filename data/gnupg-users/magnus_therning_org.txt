@_subject: Way to split MD and signing 
Is there any way of splitting the two actions of getting an MD and
signing this MD?
I have an automated system that generates a lot of large files.  I
want to sign these files, but I want to keep the secret key on a more
secure system and I want to avoid having to send the generated files
over the network.  I've found the --print-md command, but there
doesn't seem to be a --sign-md command :(
