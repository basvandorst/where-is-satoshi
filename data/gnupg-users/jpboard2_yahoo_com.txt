@_subject: Split Data Packet into Multiple Packets? 
I looked into the OpenPGP Message Format spec, and some encrypted files, and figured out that no matter how large my encrypted message is, gpg uses a single Data Packet for the cipher text.  Can I somehow split that Data Packet into multiple independent Data Packets and decrypt them independently of each other?  I know I can't do that with standard command-line args to gpg, but I'm willing to manipulate the Data Packet to do this.  Is it possible from a technical standpoint ov view?
Also, what is the format of that Data Packet?  The OpenPGP Message Format is silent on that matter.  I'm not using any compression when I encrypt, so the Data Packet should be about the same size as the unencrypted file.  However, it's usually about 55 bytes longer than that.  What other information is stored in the Data Packet and what is the format?

@_subject: Redirecting STDIN 
I'm trying to encode a file in a shell script on a linux machine.  The script is getting stuck on an interactive question for which the answer is always 'y' (yes).  I tried redirecting stdin from a file, and with 'echo "y" | ....", but that doesn't work for some reason (it works with other programs that take interactive input from the user).  I also tried the --yes option, but this doesn't work either.
How can I redirect STDIN to pgp so that questions are always answered 'y' and my script won't have to wait on user inputs?

This problem exists with gpg and with the older pgp 2.x.  I'd like to solve it by redirecting STDIN because pgp 2.x doesn't implement the options that you specify.

@_subject: Corrupted File 
I have a fairly large file (about 10 mbytes) that was corrupted on disk.  About 5-10 pages of the file (4096-byte blocks) were lost and set to zero.  The file is a PGP encryption of a another file which is a 'tar' file of other smaller ASCII text files.
I would like to decrypt as much of this file as possible.  I know with several blank pages, I can never fully recover the file.  However, most of the data is still legitimate.  Is it possible to recover it with the gpg tools?  To this point, I had been using the older PGP 5.0 version, but I can try gpg if it can decrypt most of the file.

@_subject: Corrupted File 
The file is corrupted (a 4096-byte page full of zereos), at seemingly random places, but not near the front of the file.
The file was encrypted with PGP 5.0.  I tried to decrypt with PGP 5.0 and that didn't work.  Should I try with gpg?  Does gpg behave gracefully if the input file is corrupted?  I don't normally use gpg: can I decrypt a file with gpg that was originally encrypted with pgp 5.0?
