The announcement read:
Invoking GnuPG that way is insecure without knowing the contents of the
signature file. An attacker could have replaced it by something that's
not, in fact, a detached signature.
I've attached an exemplary signature file (named gnupg-2.1.0.tar.bz2.sig
for your convenience) that demonstrates the problem:
Future announcements should call --verify with two files as arguments;
the same goes for

files. The date is now also correct (although the time is still off):
As the generated signature file was even smaller than the original one,
I padded it to full length with a private/experimental packet (tag 60):
