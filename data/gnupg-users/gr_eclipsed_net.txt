@_subject: gpg vs gpgv default keyring directory... 
That is true, and is clearly documented in gpgv(1):
  FILES
         ~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg
                   The default keyring with the allowed keys
gpg(1) looks at a different file:
  FILES
  [...]
         ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
                   The public keyring
         ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.lock
                   and the lock file
Note the presence of a lock file for gpg(1). This is because gpg(1)
can actually edit keyrings, whereas gpgv(1) purposely cannot.
I expect that gpgv(1) is intended to be used for automated processes
which should never download new PGP keys from a keyserver. gpg(1)
can be configured, though ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf, to automatically
retrieve unrecognized keys from a keyserver (and there are probably
some other pubring modification operations that can be set to happen
automatically when you run gpg that I'm forgetting).
The point would be for gpgv(1) to always present exactly the same
interface while you continued to use gpg(1) for day to day
If you want to just verify things with a keyring that you can be
sure won't get modified unless you actively modify it, export the
public keys you want it to verify into ~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg and
use gpgv(1). If you don't really care, then use `gpg -v`.

Do you do this to avoid the lengthy automated trustdb rebuilds, or

I avoid the pain of trustdb rebuilds when I actually want to be
reading mail by having no-auto-check-trustdb in gpg.conf and these
two cron jobs:
30 4 1 * * zsh -c 'time gpg --rebuild-keydb-caches'

The message is pretty clear, provided you know what quoted printable

from being mangled, but since things like =20 in the middle of PGP
ASCII-armored key data COULD be valid, we can't be sure what to
leave and what to remove (quoted printable replaces other characters
than line-ending =20s).
Either your friend didn't attach the key with the proper MIME type
or the MTA he's sending it through doesn't know about the PGP MIME
types and made the (poor) decision to mangle MIME types it doesn't
Your friend transmitting their public key to you through a different

You're right, and that's certainly possible. I think you were taken
too literally, but I didn't pay attention to the conversation till
just now.
What happens when you go through the motions you describe is that a
temporary key (symmetric, I think, but I've never actually looked at
GnuPG's implementation) is generated, the message enciphered with
that key, the key enciphered separately with each of recipients' keys,
and the whole mess sent along.
That's not an accurate description of what GnuPG does. (That is,
viewing messages that I have composed in mutt and enciphered to
more than one recipient, it is still possible to see to what
recipients it was enciphered, and it is possible for those recipients
to take the PGP block on my hard drive and decipher it.) Please,
Neil, don't assert statements like this unless you actually know how
the software works, because it really is confusing to people who

compatibility options (--openpgp, --rfc1991, --pgp{2,6..8}) when
decoding on your end. It's possible that it's some unnecessary
option he has set on his end that would make you need to use one of
these options, and if he really doesn't need it, he could probably
unset it to make your life easier.
If all else fails, have him encipher a message to both your key and
mine (0x0cf9091a; get it from subkeys.pgp.net, please) and set that

I don't believe that was the case. I don't have the original message

  /^-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----$/
before any message text. The message text is followed by:
  /^-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----$/

Because keys aren't files, they're objects that can be represented

My argument wasn't that, it was that tersity isn't very important
because the average user will see this message only very seldomly.
The very fact that we will see it seldomly means that it should be
at least slightly more verbose and specific so that we understand
what it means. I see short, useless error messages out of, say,
Veritas Volume Manager maybe once a year. I know I know what they
mean, but I have to go use Google to remember what I did the last
time to fix it. It's really irritating to have to check
documentation when even the littlest bit more information presented
by the application would have meant I didn't need to.
I think you're overstating the quantity possible reasons on the
average key (would you care to present a sample key on the keyservers
that, were its most current signing subkey revoked or expired,
would present a "huge number", please?), and I think you're ignoring
the usefulness of the date stamps that are absolutely required by
the protocol.
I think you're worrying about irritating a couple of very
experienced users by giving them a slightly longer error message
when you should be concerned about confusing the far greater number
of less-experienced users with an insufficiently specific error

90% of the people who see this for the first time will be seeing it
on a key that expired. Either a friend of theirs forgot to update
their expiration date, the user themselves didn't know they had
CREATED an expiration date, or they just need to do --recv-key to
see a new self-signature on the key.
Telling an experienced user "You may want to check keyid FOO" will
do much more for them. They'll say, "Oh, damn, I forgot to update my
key." Telling a new user to "You may want to check keid FOO" will
make them go, "Huh?" read the docs, understand what is meant by
"keyid", look at that keyid with gpg --list-keys... and see why it's
no longer valid.
In both cases, telling them about the most recently invalidated key
is all you need in a short form, as long as you also provide a "this
key is bad, and this key is bad, and hey, all your keys are bad"
output in a verbose form.
This is really just not as complicated as you're trying to make it.
No, a user that can't figure out that the other keys are expired
doesn't even KNOW to look at the other keys.
I believe you are flatly mistaken in this case.
Date stamps are HUGELY relevant to the confused user issue precisely
here. Telling Werner that keyid 621CC013 has expired *immediately*
reminds him "Oh, damn, I forgot to update my key." Saying "the key
doesn't support encryption" forces him to go do the investigation
himself which you could very easily have just done for him because
you were looking at each of those keys. The utility of the date
stamp is that you can use it to tell which relevant subkey was
handled last by the owner of the key.
All of that aside... what's wrong with a six line error message?
What's the problem with saying all of those things all of the time?

Okay, well, there's another reason not to use this method of
cryptographic signature: it costs money. It costs money
legitimately, of course, since VeriSign and (less dispicable, imho)
companies like them employ people whose job it is to verify that you
really are who you say you are before they sign your certificate.
This is, in certain ways more attractive for business
correspondence: PGP is nice, but it's inherently a system based
around personal relationships. It feels a bit forced in business
relationships. This is probably no small part of the reason we use
certificate systems, rather than PKI systems, for cryptographic
authentication and encryption of data on "secure" web pages.
As an example: for the first time since I've been working there,
and probably the first time ever, a customer of my employer requested
that we verify the signature on our public key, sent to them so
that they could FTP PGP-enciphered files to us. This is definitely
not part of my job description, but I'm probably one of three people
in an 800-person company who understood the request.  Of the other
two: one's the CTO, and the other was busy fixing either the Cisco
router or the Exchange server. No other customer (much less

Are vCards really a Microsoft invention? My first experience with
them was, as I said, within Mac OS (classic) and Eudora, so maybe
I'm tainted by that, but I had the impression that they weren't
actually invented in Redmond, but merely embraced (and, I would
habitually assume, extended) by Microsoft.

[Please don't Cc on responses to posts to mailing lists. I read the
mailing lists. I actively avoid setting a Reply-To: unless I mean
it, and my MUA sets a Mail-Followup-To: header quite on purpose
including ONLY the mailing lists address. If your MUA actively did

RFCs 2015 and 3156.
Possibly, I'm being a bit liberal with my usage of the verb
"deprecate", since I don't think it was done explicitly. Those RFCs
present a simple, clear way that any MUA that treates MIME-encoded
messages properly (as is also defined in several other RFCs; don't
recall which off the top of my head, but I expect that Michael
Elkins references them in the above) can process PGP-signed data,
PGP-enciphered data, and PGP keys gracefully. MUAs that support MIME
but fail to support PGP/MIME are failing to comply with the RFCs,
largely through laziness on the developers' part in the case that
they're already capable of parsing PGP data.
That is clearly a problem. Just as clearly, it is not my problem.
Good luck with that.
Many keyservers mangle keys with subkeys, of which 0cf9091a has
several. You may want to try removing your copy of 0cf9091a from
your public keyring and retrieving it from subkeys.pgp.net, which
treats subkeys properly, which may well make your filter in pine
function properly.
If it doesn't, you might consider mutt, for which pine keybindings
are readily available (and may even be in the source distribution
these days). mutt is the canonical example of an MUA that complies
with the MIME/PGP RFCs. Arguably it's the reference implementation
of those RFCs. Michael Elkins wrote all three of them.
Honestly, I don't really care, since I'm certain that my PGP
signatures are valid, verifiable down the line in the mail archives,
and since those with whom I communicate privately have no problems
reading my application/pgp-encrypted MIME parts.

You are mistaken. The Mailman software running on lists.gnupg.org
can do nothing to stop your SMTP server from connecting to my SMTP
server and delivering a second copy of your message when you
explicitly state my private email address in the Cc field in addition
to stating the list's email address in the To field, as was the
case on the message to which I replied.
So: please don't Cc me privately on responses to posts to mailing
(If your suggestion is that the gnupg-users mailing list should
mangle Reply-To headers in an attempt to *force* you to reply to
the mailing list, I strongly disagree. Your MUA should Do the Right
Thing based on the headers my MUA has sent for it to read.)
I'm a little vague on what you could find lacking, since mutt's
release version (never mind its quite stable development version)
supports all of the IMAP protocol plus several common ways of
enciphering that protocol, including the ability to communicate
gracefully via SSL with Microsoft Exchange servers. But, again,
that is clearly a problem and, equally clearly, it is not my problem.

Aha, my apoligies to Doug.
He's right, I'm wrong.
The version of Mailman in use on lists.gnupg.org (2.1.2) is
significantly newer than that to which I'm used, and it does have
precisely the option that he describes:
  Avoid duplicate copies of messages?
  When you are listed explicitly in the To: or Cc: headers of a list
  message, you can opt to not receive another copy from the mailing
  list. Select Yes to avoid receiving copies from the mailing list;
  select No to receive copies.
  If the list has member personalized messages enabled, and you elect
  to receive copies, every copy will have a X-Mailman-Copy: yes header
  added to it. Doug, it's a nice thought, but it's not what I want. I want only to
receive the copy WITH the list headers, so that the mail is properly
sortable. I don't want to receive the private copy without that,
since that ends up in my inbox, where it distracts from the (more
relevant to my life) messages that belong there.
It's seldom that people reply-to-all when replying to messages I
post to mailing lists (that is, existing etiquette *is* to reply to
the mailing list only, especially in the presence of a
Mail-Followup-To header explicitly asking you to do that), which is
why I merely (and politely, I think) request that you not Cc me

Nice to see someone using Ryan's remailer.

That'd be a great idea if they arrived at anything resembling the
same time and it was funtionally reasonable to keep one in the
incoming queue until another copy showed up.
The real answer is for me to examine the headers locally and drop
anything addressed to me but also addressed to a mailing list I know
I'm subscribed to, of course. And I'd do that if it happened often
enough to matter, but it doesn't, so I just ask politely and go on

If you'd like to email me privately to have a conversation off the

That has the same problem as disabling delivery in Mailman: the
message delivered directly to my SMTP server is guaranteed to arrive
before the message delivered to the mailing list and, since the
sane way to sort mailing lists is on their headers (think Bcc for
why sorting on mailing list address is unacceptable), it will not
get sorted into the mailing list's mbox properly, which means it
ends up in my inbox and NOT in the mailing lists mbox which is
exactly NOT what I want.
I'm quite familiar with that, thank you. It doesn't do any good in
this context.
One more time, same as before: if this were really a problem, I'd
have fixed it locally. It's not a problem frequently enough that a

Something's very wrong here. That's 32 bytes too short for a
fingerprint. Are you sure you reproduced it correctly?
What does GnuPG list as your keyid?
Ah, yes. I believe GnuPG will prefer to the subkey for all purposes
rather than the master, but don't quote me on that without checking
the documentation.
Probably not. You said "here's an RSA key in OpenPGP format", if the
keyserver were using "a different algorithm" than something would be
horribly broken about and we'd have noticed that by now.

That's wonderful, but Newton explicitly stated his key fingerprint
  785F DFF3 7029 3FBD 45CE  747C 93CA E808 136F C036
and that he'd sent the key to subkeys.pgp.net (by implication, in
referencing that he'd sent it to the keyservers "in his signature")...
which has never heard of keyid 136FC036 (as in, the last 64 bits
of the fingerprint).
So, unless you're suggesting that something about subkeys.pgp.net is
also broken, there is something odd going on. Is synchronization
between the various subkeys DNS RR servers flaky right now?
I just tried again:
uriel:~% gpg --recv-key  136FC036
gpg: requesting key 136FC036 from subkeys.pgp.net

gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
I have a feeling that I may have just gotten lucky (since I did try
the recv-key several times before I responded the first time).
