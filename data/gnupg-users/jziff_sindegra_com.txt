I'm having trouble compiling gpgme. What follows is part of my cmd line:
./configure --prefix=/usr
config.status: executing depfiles commands
config.status: executing libtool commands

        G13 version:     unknown, min. 2.1.0
        Assuan version:  2.0.1
        FD Passing:      libtool: link: gcc -g -O2 -Wall -Wcast-align -Wshadow -Wstrict-prototypes -o .libs/t-thread1 t-thread1.o  ../../src/.libs/libgpgme-pthread.so

make: *** [all] Error 2
I do not know how to add the libary to the linker command line. I confess I am not so knowledgeable about these kind of things. Any advice?

@_subject: gpg fails to decrypt files encrypted to the same name as the original 
Hey hackers,
I noticed this very interesting behavior in my version of gpg (2.0.17):
1. take a simple text file and call it say test.txt, encrypt it to a
file named test.txt in the same directory so that it overwrites it. (gpg
-o test.txt -e test.txt)
2. decrypt file test.txt with gpg (gpg -d test.txt) and get gibberish.
It does not seem to happen when I have the output renamed to something
else. I know this is a highly unusual (and probably ineffective way) of
using gpg but I still thought it was interesting that it would fail. Any
thoughts on this (potential) bug? Can anyone else recreate it, or is it
actually a feature/unavoidable side-effect?
