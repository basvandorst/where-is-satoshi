@_subject: Downloading the same key results in different files 
Hi, as keyserver spoofing and poisoning has been a concern, I decided to test it by downloading the same key from the same keyserver at different times and from different locations.
When I exported the resulting keys using ascii the files were significantly different, 3k difference in file sizes. Is this expected?
All the keys have the same fingerprint and the same subkeys. All the keys successfully verify a good signature from the source address.
To account for differences in software version I imported each into a single machine, rexported, then deleted the imported key and followed the same process with the next key, so each key was exported using the same software version. They are still different from each other and identical with the original. Is there any explanation for this?

Good call. I forgot about the signing keys and sure enough there were a few differences. Thanks.

@_subject: Problems reading smartcard 
I have openpgp keys loaded on a yubikey in smartcard mode but am having problems accessing the card. Originally there were some permission issues but i worked them out to the point that gpg --card-status consistently reads the card. This is on fedora. However gpg2 --card-status gives "gpg selecting openpgp failed Card error gpg OpenPGP card not available Card error"
Since selinux had previously been a problem I did setenforce 0 to troubleshoot. Now gpg2 --card-status reads the card successfully. However there are no new avc denials so I'm not sure how or why selinux is blocking gpg2 but not gpg. Even more weirdly If while selinux is in permissive mode I read the card with gpg2 I can't afterwards read it with gpg. I get "gpg pcsc_establish_context failed no service (0x801001d) gpg OpenPGP card not available general error"
So using gpg I can access the card if selinux is on or off unless I first access the card with gpg2. Afterwards I get errors from gpg.
gpg  --version
gpg2 --version
Libgcrypt 1.7.9
Any idea how to troubleshoot this?

Ah, that makes sense. Thanks. I'll try asking on an selinux help forum and see if they have any ideas.
