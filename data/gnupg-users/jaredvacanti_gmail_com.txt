@_subject: Specifying smartcard reader when multiple readers attached 
Using gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.19, is there a way to specify a reader when multiple
readers are available? For example:
$ gpg --card-status --reader FEITIAN
gpg: WARNING: "--reader-port" is an obsolete option - it has no effect
except on scdaemon
I seem to only be able to interact with smartcards or the Yubikey 5 NFC
OpenPGP applet when the device is the only one available.
Any feedback would be really appreciated.
