If the keyserver implemented a signer blacklist, (which would scrub the
blacklisted signature from any current or incoming public keys), what
consequences am I missing?
In essence, shadowbanning a signing key. Keyservers without blacklist
support would still pass around the toxic keys, but only until they get
updated with the blacklist.
The notion of nothing getting deleted is a feature (as nice as it would be
to be able to nuke my keys from the 90s that never really got used to begin
with). Masking out signatures from bad actors seems like a valid solution.
It doesn't address all of the problems were seeing now (core infrastructure
not in a maintainable state for the project, using effectively voodoo to do
its job)
But could be a start.

Thanks - I knew I was being naive.
Is it correct that the thesis that describes the fundamentals of the
current reconciliation algorithm is 'Spreading Rumors Cheaply, Quickly, and

Tangentially related - I've seen docs recommending having your
portable keychain have a subkey for signing, and that keychain to lack
the master secret key entirely ( and putting that one in an
undisclosed secure location), with a different passphrase, etc.
What are gnupg-users thoughts on that sort of setup?
