encrypt each individual file and then combine them with winzip (with command
line parameters).
From: AthlonRob   [mailto:athlonrobnf woensdag 10 april 2002   2:45To: gnupg-users Multiple File   Encryption (Win32)
Hi all-
I'm trying to come up with a way to encrypt   batches of files... 10-15 at most with varying file names.  I want the   files to be encrypted into either a single large file or in to multiple files,   each replacing the non-encrypted version.  The files are *NOT* ASCII   text.  I want to then be able to decrypt each of them to the original   state with a single command (batch file)
Now... after searching around the web for a   while, I'm not having much luck.  Any thoughts?  I've got GnuPG   downloaded and working.  I'm running Windows XP... so this is a Win32   thing.

@_subject: Importing gnupg secret keys into pgp 
I know this is the wrong way round to do this, but I've recently
acquired a windows machine at work and am using outlook. The simplest
way to get messages signed is to use pgp. But I can't seem to import my
secret keys into it ...
You could use the gdata.de gnupg plugin 4 outlook so u don't need pgp.
to get the secret key into pgp:
export the public key from gpg
export the secret key from gpg
use a editor to append them
import into pgp.
et voila

The problem is you do not have the IDEA cipher installed.  Read:

 Then why the fuck did you repost the whole fucking thing to the list,
 including the part in html, and even attached a jpeg file to your reply?

@_subject: GPG Windows tip 
I've got this tip for making GPG easier to use in Windows.
To add encrypt/decrypt commands to the context menu (right click on a file):
Assuming gpg.exe is installed in c:\app\gnupg
the id of the key you'd like to use is ID
then with
in the key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell
(create the shell key if it is not there yet):
For encrypting create a key:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\GPG encrypt and sign with \command
put double qoutes around the %1 in case the file name has spaces.
If you have more keys, then add more entries
For decrypting create a key:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\GPG decrypt and verify (to file.out)\command

Well, the file name %1 is enclosed in double quotes, so if GPG supports
long file names (with spaces), then it should work fine. You can try it out
and memorise all the options...
My tip has its limitations.

is "filena~1.asc.out". I just wondered is there some way to ensure
that GPG can get a long file name form correctly.
Yep, same problem here (W2K).
I tried "%~f1" (see Start | Help, index %), but then gpg.exe fails.
