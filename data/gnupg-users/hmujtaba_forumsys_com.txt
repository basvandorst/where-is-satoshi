@_subject: Compression and partial length encoding 
Hi all,
When using partial length encoding, how does GPG compress the data
before encryption? My guess would be that the chunks are compressed
individually and then encrypted individually. The receiving side is then
able to decrypt and uncompress the chunks individually as well. Is this
how it is done?

@_subject: OpenPGP Messages and Compression 
Hi all,
I had a couple of questions regarding the structure of OpenPGP messages and compression:
1) Taking a single plain text file and splitting it into
multiple "n" chunks where each chunk is represented by
one "Sym. Encrypted & Integrity Protected Data" packet, can we concatenate the multiple SEIPD packets into one file, ie have multiple PGP msgs in one file? Can GPGD decrypt that file which contains multiple SEIPD packets representing the original plain text file?
2) Does GPGD (1.2.2) take the whole file and read it into
the buffer and then compress it, i.e does it take a 10G
file and compress it or does it have the ability to to
split the plain text file and compress each chunk and then put it together for calculating the MDC packet?

it such that the Encrypted Data Packet uses partial lengths. I am

Symmetrically Encrypted and MDC Packet (tag 18). I cannot find this tag in RFC 2440. Where can I get more information on
this tag type and its internal structure? I am trying to understand how
partial length chunks are built. Are these partial chunks nested within
the outer Symm Encrypted and MDC Packet? What is the name of the
outer-most packet? Is it the Symmetrically Encrypted packet? -----Original Message-----

Normally GnuPG chooses partial or not depending on the requirements of
the data (very large files must be partial, other files can be partial
or not).  You can force it to always be partial by giving it the data

Hi list,
I'm thinking about using Jar in a Java application I'm coding.
Not only as an archiving means, but also because it can be signed
To make the long story short, the Jar archive would contain a text file,
and would be signed by everyone who enters in its possession and agrees with
the content of the text file. The signer would then distribute the newly
signed Jar to others.
Since I can't ask every user to get a X.509 certificate, the idea is to
sign the .jar with their PGP key by following exactly the Jar and Manifest specifications (
Those specs tell us that PKCS7 RSA, PKCS7 DSA and PGP are supported by default, and even that one can use its own algorithm.
However, I have a few problems :
1- I can't find any live example of Jar signed with PGP
2- can't even any info about doing it programmatically
3- the 'keytool' util (with Sun's jdk) don't want to import my PGP keys
in the .keystore (even if I ask him very kindly) so I can use it with the 'jarsigner' util :-[
So, a few questions that may protect me from doing naughty things :
1- am I totally nuts to want to do this ?
2- do you know a way to intrude my PGP key in the evil .keystore ?
3- do you know some application on the web (and open source preferably)

The problem with the this encoding is that it is indeed indeterminate
length - there is no length encoded in the packet itself, so the
reader must infer from context (i.e. end of file, end of encapsulating
packet) what the end of the packet is.  2440 deprecates this format as
a SHOULD NOT.
GnuPG can understand this format, but in general does not generate it
except for compatibility reasons.  You can force it in some cases with
the --rfc1991 option, but not all packets make sense as indeterminate

So I guess the message was not encrypted using gnupg? Would be nice to

@_subject: Partial body length encoding for Compressed packets 
Hi David,
There's food for thought in your comments. Sanity is very important to
me. So, thanks. On a techincal level, I was only curious about this mixing and matching
of partial body length headers and indeterminate encoding. I guess I
will never know for sure why it is that way with 2.x, and perhaps 5.x. -----Original Message-----

PGP 2 isn't RFC-2440 compliant.  PGP 2 dates from quite a few years
before 2440 was even written.
It won't work ;)
Sane PGP interoperability requires knowing when to give up.  For
example, there are details between PGP 5 and 7 where you can support
one or the other, but not both.
To a certain extent, supporting bugs from old versions that have been
replaced many times over is actually harmful.  I know that some users
have settled on one version of PGP and will continue to use that
version until the sun goes nova, but given the choice between
supporting that tiny minority of people, and the huge majority of
people who are using something actually RFC compliant, I know where
I'm going to spend my energy.

But PGP2 does support partial body length encoding! Using the --pgp2
option when encrypting, I can see that GPG uses PBL encoding for both
encrypted and literal data packets, but not for compressesd. I must be
totally wacko, but I don't get it. Why would GPG generate PBL encoded
packets for PGP2? -----Original Message-----

It's historical.  PGP 2.x came before the partial body length encoding
existed, so that's why it doesn't support it at all.

That explains it! Thanks much.

PGP2 does not support partial body length packets.  GnuPG is forced to
use PBL encoding if it does not know the length of a message (say, if
you're encrypting stdin or something with no clear size).  In that
case, regardless of the --pgp2 flag, PGP2 will not be able to decrypt

@_subject: checking created signature failed: bad signature 
Hi everyone,
I am using GPG 124 to sign a file using the keypair below. I got the
strange error below, which I have never seen before.  Exactly what kind
of check is GPG performing on the created signature? The passphrase for
the keypair is TestingPassphrase.
Hasnain. gpg --sign -u Bob file1024 You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Bob C. Omplex "
1024-bit RSA key, ID 8F79C1B7, created 2005-03-08 (main key ID 4CFAD743)
