I am having problems veryifing some keys signed with a key generated
with pgp2.6ui
The key wasn't self-signed originally. I was able to import it using
And i convinced the key owner to self sign it so I now have a
self-signed version.
However any keys that he has signed I can't use. When I try and encrypt
to these keys I get the following error:
jackal:~$ gpg -ea -r bunglon test.txt
gpg: bunglon: skipped: unusable public key
gpg: test.txt: encryption failed: unusable public key
I have given full trust to the original signing key.
Using PGP 6.5.8 I get a similar error:
Key for user ID: bunglon 1024-bit RSA key, Key ID 0xB5DDA201, created 1999/07/21
WARNING:  Because this public key is not certified with a trusted
signature, it is not known with high confidence that this public key
actually belongs to: "bunglon ".
Are you sure you want to use this public key (y/N)?
However using PGP 6.0.2i on windows I have no such problems.
Checking the signature gives the following:
jackal:~$ gpg --check-sigs bunglon
pub  1024R/B5DDA201 1999-07-21 bunglon sig-       69FC1101 1999-07-21  kholil I assume the "-" means the signature is invalid. I have hunted the docs for info
about this but found nothing.
So, is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?
Please help,

I am normally a linux user but I would like to be able to run gpg from a floppy disk when I am travelling so I have started playing around with the Windows port of gpg. I am having the following problem when using my RSA private key.
I can encrypt a message but when I try and decrypt I get the following error:
A:\>gpg --homedir a:\keys message.asc
gpg: protection algorithm 1 is not supported
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID 928F9C71, created 2000-10-18
      "Iain "
gpg: public key decryption failed: unknown cipher algorithm
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID 69FC1101, created 1999-07-21
      "kholil "
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
I am sorry if this has been discussed previously on this list but without a search engine it is very hard to track down past posts.
cheers, Iain.
P.S. Please CC replies to my address.
