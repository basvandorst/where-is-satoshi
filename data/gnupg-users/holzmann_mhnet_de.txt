Are you sure about what you wrote? IMHO --import is the action/option needed to
import someones public key, not to decrypt a message.

@_subject: changed permissions on ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg 
it comes to my attention, that the permissions of the file ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
after an import are modified. I set the permissions *before* to 600.
I have downloaded the files from freeswan, then i have iported their key with:
gpg --import freeswan-sigkey2002.asc
While importing gnupg prints out (sorry for german):
idm-06: gpg -v --import freeswan-sigkey2002.asc
gpg: Warnung: Unsichere Zugriffsrechte für file "/home/holzmann/.gnupg/pubring.gpg"
Now i delete the key with: gpg --delete-key 0x46EAFCE1
Immediately i took a look at pubting.gpg. It was again set to 644!
Why does gpg change the permissions from 600 to 644?
Kind regards,
Micha Holzmann

@_subject: how to revoke a key? 
a friend has lost his passphrase. He created a revocation ceritificate,
but do not know how to revoke it at the key servers.
I told him first he should import the revocation certifikate into his
keyring and afterwards he should export his key and send this export
to the key-server.
First he sent me his exported key. I was able to import it and saw that
it is revoked. But the transfer to the keyserver fails.
I tried to find information with google, but nowhere was an exact example.
So i am not really sure if my insctrucions where ok.
gpg was started as following:
gpg --send-keys --keyserver wwwkeys.nl.pgp.net revoked-key.asc
kind regards,
Micha Holzmann
