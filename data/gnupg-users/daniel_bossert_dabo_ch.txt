Is anybody using pgp on Android? I did some years ago, would like to, but am afraid of security reason.
I have safed my keys on my laptop only.
How are you handling it in ages of mobiles?

@_subject: Which version of GnuPG to use? 
Hi all
Some years ago I used GnuPG, but somewhen stopped with it.
Now I want to start again. However there are many rumors that it is unsecure meanwhile.
I need recommendations:
- Which version of software shall I install?
- Create key via cli-commands or is Windows-Version ok?
- Which keys shall I take (there was an article not to encrypt/sign with Many thanks and kind regards

@_subject: Automatically delete old keys from servers 
Hi all
On the key servers are many old keys lying around which aren't valid anymore.
Could you implement a function on the servers which delete keys after let's say one year automatically,reminding the user via email one month ahead to reupload the keys?
Me too have some old, useless keys there and people shouldn't use an invalid public key anymore.
Daniel
