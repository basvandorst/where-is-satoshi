@_subject: clearsign destroys files 
The following command sequence seems to destroy the pdf file:
gpg --clearsign -o signed.pdf original.pdf
gpg --decrypt -o destroyed.pdf signed.pdf
The new file is slightly smaller than the original one, the difference
seems to be some differences in linefeed/newline characters.
Adding --no-textmode does not make a difference. With --sign instead of
clearsign, the original file and the signed/decrypted file match, no
breakage occurs. My GnuPG version is 1.4.1, tried on FreeBSD and
thanks, t.
