--ignore-time-conflict
                 GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps  asso-
                 ciated  with  keys and signatures have plausible
                 values.  However, sometimes a signature seems to
                 be  older  than  the  key due to clock problems.
                 This option makes these checks just a warning.
