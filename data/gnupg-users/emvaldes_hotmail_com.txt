Thanks for this bash-code. It's interesting how people ask if there is a need
for automating something. The question should be "what should not be
automated/scriptable" other than that, EVERYTHING must be scriptable. for
some reason there is a gen-key, right? so, why not having one for
Nevertheless, thanks for the incredible work you guys have done and keep
doing. Please, add a gen-subkey at some point. The use-case is to provision
systems to end-users where a set of configurations allows the end-user to
start working asap. There is not a fully automated setup as the passphrase
will be asked to the end-user during the setup. The subkeys portion of this
automation will allow the end-user to not having to deal with the
"complicated" process (trust when others tell you that is "complicated" to
them). Thanks.
