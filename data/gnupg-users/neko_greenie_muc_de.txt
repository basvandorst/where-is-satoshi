@_subject: why are there 2 keys? 
sorry for asking a FAQ, I didn't find the question in the official FAQ
on the web.
I generated a pair of keys for me. If I now want to send my public key I
get two keys offered, one marked as 's' and one marked with 'e'.
I suppose, one is for encryption and one is for signing.
Which one do I have to send, if someone asks me for my public key -
both? And why are there two keys? My first key was only one for everything.
(It's a few years ago, and now I decided to start new with gnupgp, the old key was not used for years now and is lost)
