And, to complete the story, since THEM broke the signing key, THEM can imitate Bob's signature to their heart's content and you will believe the lie (and so will Alice) until a mistake is made and someone draws attention to that with a revoke.  The advantage to THEM in creating the new sub-key is only to tempt you not to use the old one (which THEM cannot decrypt) & thus reduce the chance that you will find the error before Alice does.
(1) Gpg cannot protect against a compromised key until somebody knows that it has been compromised.  If it could, there would be no need to revoke type 20 ElGamals.
(2) Alice can only warrant that she checked Bob's identity to match the key.  It says nothing about who else has access to that key.  The scenario remains the same if Bob voluntarily gives his key to THEM before getting it signed by Alice.
