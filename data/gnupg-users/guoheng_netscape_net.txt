I am using PGP desktop security by Network Associates running on windows.
Recently I installed GPG in linux and generated a pair of keys. When I try to
export both public key and private key, my PGP program can not import the
private key. It imports public key only. I remove passphase before I export
keys from GPG. Any hints?
