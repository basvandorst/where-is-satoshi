@_subject: Removing need for /dev/random? 
I'm not that familiar with prngs, but why does gnupg depend on the OS's
prng (/dev/random) instead of using an included (maybe optional) one of
its own? This would be helpful for those who wish to use gnupg on systems
with untested entropy devices (personally, I'd like to be able to use
gnupg under irix, but this applies to OSs in general).
thanks for any insight,
