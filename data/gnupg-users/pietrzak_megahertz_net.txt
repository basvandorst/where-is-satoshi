@_subject: GNUPG and PGP FreeWare 6.5.3 
I am having the most trouble using these two together (GNUPG in Linux
and PGP 6.5.3 on Win95).  I have read countless posts and messages on
this, and none have given me a complete answer.  Reading that GNUPG has
some security enhancements over PGP, I decided to create my keys with it
using Option 1 and 1536 bit encryption.  Everything worked fine (in
Linux): encrypting, decrypting, signing, etc.
I exported my public and private keys (gpg --export-secret-key --output
keys.gpg pietrzak and tried to import them into PGP
6.5.3.  PGP said it was corrupted.  If I use the tag '--export' instead
of '--export-secret-key', it imports fine but I don't have the secret
key in PGP.  So....  I deleted the GNUPG keys and created a pair in PGP
with CAST5 encryption (DH/DSS 1536), knowing beforehand GNUPG needed
this kind of encryption.  I exported it with 6.0 extensions and with the
private key.  Importing them into GNUPG was a piece of cake and works
great (I can encrypt files in GNUPG and de-crypt them in PGP... and
This leads back to my original problem.  Is it possible to take
advantage of GNUPG security enhancements and still use those keys in PGP
in win95?  Thanks before hand to anyone able or willing to help.

after hours of mental anguish (literally), I finally got it to work
thanks for your help
I got desperate.  I downloaded the source for GNUPG 1.0.2 (before I
installed via RPM), compiled it on my slow comp, and installed it.  I
went to OPTIONS in
PGPkeys in win95 and set it that the ONLY allowed algorithm is CAST5.  I
also added a few lines to my ~/.gnupg/options: cipher-algo CAST5
s2k-cipher-algo CAST5
s2k-digest-algo SHA1
compress-algo 1
disable-cipher-algo BLOWFISH
disable-cipher-algo TWOFISH
disable-cipher-algo 3DES
disable-pubkey-algo ELG
i prolly disabled something i shouldn't, but.... it works :)
This OPTIONS file would support the following algo's:   (accessed by
hitting 'gpg --version')
Home: ~/.gnupg
Supported algorithms:
Cipher: CAST5
Pubkey: ELG-E, DSA
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160
I went over to GPG and created new keys *with* a good password. Exported it ('gpg --armor
--output key4pgp --no-comment --export-secret-key
pietrzak and imported it into PGP with no problems.  also, you can't have the line "force-v3-sigs" commented because then PGP
in win95 says it's a bad signature (question: why??).
now I can encrypt and sign any file in PGP in win95 and de-crypt it in
GPG, and vice-versa. :)
just one question though: when i imported the GPG keys into PGP, it said
(and still says) that the cipher is IDEA, but i can't be because my GPG
doesn't even recognize IDEA.  is PGP wrong?
Oliver, about your RSA question: I don't think so.  the only difference
I could think of would be if you *created* the secret key using the RSA

I asked the same question.   This works (thanks Todd):
There is no need to leave the password empty when exporting a GnuPG
key! By default, GnuPG encrypts the secret key using the Blowfish
algorithm, and PGP 6.5.3 does not understand this algorithm.
Here is a much more secure solution:
1. % gpg --edit-key --s2k-cipher-algo=CAST5 --s2k-digest-algo=SHA1 \
       KEY-ID
2. Change the password (but not to an empty password!). You can just
    change it to what is was before, but gpg will re-encrypt the key
    using an algorithm pgp will understand.
3. % gpg --export-secret-key --no-comment KEY-ID > key.asc
   % gpg --export --no-comment KEY-ID >> key.asc
4. Import key.asc into pgp and everything should work fine!
P.S. Hmmmm...I don't know why the --no-comment option is necessary
     seem to recall not needing to use this in the past.
P.P.S.  Perhaps this procedure should be added to the documentation or
        some sort of FAQ? I seem to recall a PGP5-GnuPG HOWTO which
        mentions the method of exporting an un-encrypted secret (which
        fine if you are very very very careful), but I think it is
        to never have to write your un-encrypted secret key to disk.

For step 3, you don't have to do both (it generates two exactly the same
keys).  This is enough "gpg --export-secret-key --no-comment KEY-ID >

hey all.
just one more question: I have two secret keys.  how do i sign with the
second one?  thank you.

i'm pretty sure you need the '--no-comment' tag.
so try...
gpg --armor --no-comment --output  --export
