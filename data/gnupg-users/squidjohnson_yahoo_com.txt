Hello all,
I'm just trying to configure gpg, My requirenment is
as follows
1. The client has to encrypt the messages with its key
2. the Client keys should be updated to the server
3. Using the client key the server has to decrypt the    message
I had carried out the following steps:-
from PC1 1. gpg --gen-key
    (Real name = Gpg Client
     Email-ID  = gpgclient
2. gpg --armor --export gpg > mykey.txt
3. gpg -e -r gpgclient plain.txt (after the above
command i was able to see a plain.txt.gpg binary file)
The mykey.txt and plain.txt.gpg files are transfered
to the PC2
from PC2
1. gpg --import mykey.txt
   (Got the key added message)
2. gpg -d < plain.text.gpg
The above command throug me the following message.
Where i'm doing mistake. Kindly kel me to solve the
[pgpserver pgpserver]$ gpg -d <
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: please see  for more
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit ELG-E key, ID B97C02D6,
created 2004-11-17
      "gpgclient (nothing) "
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
