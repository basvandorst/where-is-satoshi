Hello Ivan:
Yes, you have installed the software. Since you are a beginner like
me, I strongly suggest using WinPT. It gives you a window interface
to work with. Visit  and get yourself the
latest 0.7.96 binary. It will use a Windows installer. I am using it
myself and have not gone in to the commandline to use it for most of
my basic needs yet while I learn to use it.

I'm a newbie using WinPT (0.7.96rc1) & GPG (1.2.2) and still trying to
get things working for myself. I'm learning! :)
I have been using Outlook Express (before) and recently Outlook XP.
But I want to switch over to using some Windows-based client that has
it's concepts in line with those of GPG, has native support for
PGP/mime - Open source, etc. etc. and probably help test/improve it.
Any suggestions?

Hi Thomas:
I'm very happy with WinPT [1]. Take the entire suite from the download
page [2] and not just the WinPT Tray from the main page.
