@_subject: How to open Windows GPG encrypted files on Mac OS X 
I have been using GPG for Windows for some years. Recently I've bought a
Mac. I've installed the GPG for Mac OSX, but the problem is that I am not
able to open the old GPG for Windows encrypted files.
I have installed the GPGServices, so what I do is: open the Windows
encrypted files on Mac using the TextWrangler text editor, selecting the
encrypted text and choosing Services->OpenPGP Decrypt.
However, I always receive the following error: "Decryption failed. No
decryptable text was found within the selection".
Does anyone know how can I decrypt Windows-GPG encrypted files on Mac OS X?

Hi, All,
First of all, thanks for the answers!
After reviewing all answers, I have solved my problem! As Charly correctly
pointed out, there is a slightly difference between TXT files from Mac OS X
and Windows (basically Windows end-of-line is /R/F and Mac is /F)... As a
newbie in Mac OS X, I didn't know that...
The solution was to "convert" the Windows TXT file to the Mac OS X TXT
format. Then, GPGServices worked perfectly!
By the way: GPGServices is a very elegant solution! Better and simpler than
all frontends I have used in order to decrypt files in Windows...
Best regards!
