@_subject: pgp's "for your eyes only" mode 
I've just encountered a pgp encrypted (symetrically w/o public key) file
that wasn't decryptable by gpg. gpg told me the password were wrong which
made me panicing until I tried the old 2.6.2ai pgp which decrypts it but
shows a message saying that the content is for my eyes only and only shows it on screen.
Why can't gpg decrypt it?

Hello list
I didn't follow the thread but if your talking about gpg signed html pages
a simple browser plugin or access to a "libgnupg" by a browser would be enough.
As multiparted MIME messages are already standard in HTTP I can see no
problem here.
You should propose this to the mozilla guys, it would surely be cool to have
(in a browser invisible) signed (but in opposite to SSL/TLS not encrypted and not session dependant) HTML pages like e.g. news tickers or such.

I can mail you my configs, maybe you just forgot to specify your keyring
in the options file of gpg or mutt.

@_subject: Why seperate signing and encryption keys? 
Hello list
Can anybody explain me why it is quite common to have two seperate keys
bundled to "the secret key" where one (e.g. DSA) is used just for signing
and the other (e.g. ElGamal) just for encryption.
I ask because on a netlaw mailing list someone told that in Austria the
new email-signature laws would prohibit using the same key for signing and
encryption of emails (when they should be used as official documents).
