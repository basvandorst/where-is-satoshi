@_subject: general question about gnupg 
Hi all,
I'm a beginner in these encryption and security issues and, while with
all the available documentation most of my user questions are solved,
but I'm looking for something (I don't know if) not very common and I
don't really know what should I look for.
I have a server which, due to database events, sends automatically
emails with some info. I would like that these emails are sent GPG/PGP
signed (not encrypted), what kind of software should I look for? The
servers (both database and smtp) are running windows and the emails are
generated with ASPmail. Any clues would be very appreciated.
Thanks a lot

@_subject: GPG for windows 
Can anybody recommend me what software should I install for a windows outlook machine? It's for people completely new to gpg and I need it to be simple and robust, not neccesarily flexible and powerful.
I have downloaded the windows client from gnupg.org and the Gdata plugin for outlook, but I don't know if it's the best option for my needs.
Thanks a lot
