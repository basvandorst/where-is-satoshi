key between devices during the OpenPGP summit in April
( The goal
was to formalize and hopefully standardize a very simple protocol that
allows interoperability between mail user agents.
We've already gotten feedback from other vendors using OpenPGP.js such
as Mailvelope and 1&1, and we would also like to hear what the GPG
community has to say about it. Here is our current proposal:
Thanks for any feedback!
Kind regards,

That's a good question and the spec is indeed not specific enough
here. If I'm not mistaken Mailvelope only includes the primary key
packets in their current implementation. But it makes sense to include
subkey packets as well. Something to be clarified in the spec.
