@_subject: Clarification about GNUPG and GPGME 
Hello all,
We plan to encrypt data using GPGME library as part
of our application on Solaris. THis is a commercial
product. What are the implications of using this
Should we give the source code for our application
(or provide a link for that), and should we release
our application as part of GPL?
If we have to release as part of GPL, kindly suggest any other PGP libraries which can be used by our appl.
Best Regards,
