@_subject: Automation Help 
I've looked through the archive, but to no avail.
I have this script in a file on Solaris:
--homedir /home/jfair/.gnupg --no-tty --batch --always-trust --passphrase-fd
"My Pass Phrase" --force-v3-sigs --compress-algo 1 --comment ""
but the script won't run until I hit enter.  I'm trying to automate it, but
I'm having trouble.
Are these two problems related?
I've tried --quite instead of --no-tty, but with the same result.

Ha!  You don't need a passphrase with --batch.  I just looked at it for two
hours, but I didn't find the answer until AFTER I asked for help!
Never mind.
