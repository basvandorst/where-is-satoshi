@_subject: Runniing gpg2 on Linux Servers 
I installed gnupg with all related modules as well as pinentry module on a redhat linux server.
Now, when I try to run gpg2, to generate a key using command line  gpg2 --gen-key  I get the following error.
GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

You selected this USER-ID:
    "rudupa (test) "
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.
gpg-agent[12363]: can't connect to the PIN entry module: IPC connect call failed
gpg-agent[12363]: command get_passphrase failed: No pinentry
gpg: problem with the agent: No pinentry
gpg: Key generation canceled.
I am running gpg-agent in the daemon mode with following parameters
gpg-agent --options /u4/udupa/gnupg/gpg-agent.conf --daemon --verbose --log-file /tmp/log --enable-ssh-support --debug-all
