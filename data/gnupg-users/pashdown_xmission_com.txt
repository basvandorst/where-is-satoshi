@_subject: gpg-agent partitioning between sessions? 
I'm trying to "drop-in" gpg-agent for ssh-agent, and I was surprised to
find how gpg-agent behaves with multiple instances.  If I run a second
instance,and it asks me for an ssh-key password, it does not recognize the
password, but if I hit return, it gets auth (I presume) from the first
instance and connects on through.  Is there a way for it to not do this? I'd rather that the ssh-key password was prompted for each new session and
the gpg-agents did not communicate with each other.

I thought this was required to have per terminal key storage.

The latter, if someone compromises a system with a running agent, I don't
want them to have access to everything I have an ssh-key for.  Ssh-agent
asks for the key password with each new session.  With gpg-agent, all I
need to do is hit return on the key password and it appears to pass through
to another gpg-agent so access is granted without any key password prompting.

Thanks for the perspective.  I guess I was misunderstanding how ssh-agent
was working.
