@_subject: [Confusion] distinction between the 2 versions 1.4.6 & 2.0.3 & how to 
Hi all,
        I made my personal  key in Ubuntu 7.04 by the default gpg
--gen key command. I use. Then to use it, was using firepg  to sign
it. Firepg kept telling me that the signature is not valid. Thinking
it was an issue with the extension per-se made a post about the same
in firepg & was consequently banned. Although there was no explanation
given but that's another matter.
 Fishing around my own system came to the conclusion that I was using
a non-compatible version of the gnupg with the extension.
 gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.6
GnuPG comes in two flavours: 1.4.7  is the well known and portable
standalone version, whereas 2.0.4  is the enhanced and somewhat harder
to build version.
 Installed the new version gnupg 2.0.3 (which is supported in Ubuntu
at this point in time) .
 .
 Now my query is how can I make the key I have already made 2.0.3
compatible. Looking for easy instructions.  Also looked at few mirrors
and not just this one but all manuals which point to webber.dewinter.com
are down.
Lastly,  is in
someways my baby as I have contribute quite a large part into the doc.
Feel free to point out any mistakes. Any help with the above will also
be finding its way into the doc. Rest assured.

Hi Werner,
   Here's a screenshot of the email I sent :-
I'd guess you would
use the --export-secret-keys command line switch from 1.4.7 and then
--import into 2.0.3  If you don't still have 1.4.7 installed, maybe boot
from a Knoppix CD or something and make sure the key file is in the
directory gpg expects ( ~/.gnupg/  I think).
 Also what do u guys think of Mr. Casey Jones, do u think he's right
at the above.
 Please lemme know what you guys think of the above points,
            Shalom

Hi all,
 Casey could you give me more precise instructions please. How do I
sign & encrypt to an ascii file using my key ID (public key ID perhaps? )
Let's take the e.g. there :-
gpg: key D8FC66D2 marked as ultimately trusted
public and secret key created and signed.
pub   1024D/D8FC66D2 2005-09-08
      Key fingerprint = 95BD 8377 2644 DD4F 28B5  2C37 0F6E 4CA6 D8FC 66D2
uid                  Dennis Kaarsemaker (Tutorial key) sub   2048g/389AA63E 2005-09-08
 ------------------------------
 Please lemme know how to proceed further. We can also take this
off-list if you feel to be more appropriate. I don't know how the list
would look at this.

Hi John,
        First of all thank you for your help . I tried with my key id
all the combinations
gpg -a -se -u 0xD8FC66D2 -r 0xD8FC66D2 yourloveletter.txt
but I get
gpg: Invalid option "-a-se-u"
. I tried both ways using zero (0xkeyid) as well as using alphabet O
(oxkeyid)  but either way I get the same error
 gpg: Invalid option "-a-se-u"
I also  tried with space between gpg and the flags -a-se-u as well as
without space
gpg -a-se-u (0 or Oxkeyid) as well as gpg-a-se-u which told me the
former is the one to be used.
Then finally hit a brainwave and did
gpg -a -se -u OxD8FC66D2 -r OxD8FC66D2 myloveletter.txt
 With space between each flag
gpg: skipped "OxD8FC66D2": secret key not available
gpg: myloveletter.txt: sign+encrypt failed: secret key not available
Then I get this error. Can anybody explain me what's going wrong here?
 I have substituted my keyid with the general keyid. Don't know if its safe to
give out my keyid or not?
Looking for answers. Thank you all for your time.

Hi all,
      Lemme start at the clean slate with what has happened till now.
For exercises, understanding &  usage will be using the stable 2.0.3
release version in Ubuntu till I'm not clear in all the aspects.
gpg --armor --sign --encrypt -u 0x729A8B17  -r 0x729A8B17 myloveletter.txt
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
 It works also with
gpg --a --s --e --u  0x729A8B17  -r 0x729A8B17 myloveletter.txt
 which resulted in a myloveletter.txt.asc file yippy!
 I was also able to decrypt it
ou need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "shirish some phrase here "
2048-bit ELG-E key, ID some id key here, created 2007-05-05 (main key
ID 729A8B17)
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID some id key here, created 2007-05-05
      "shirish some phrase here "
gpg: Signature made Friday 18 May 2007 12:29:23 AM IST using DSA key ID 729A8B17
gpg: Good signature from "shirish some phrase here "
ok the only thing I have changed in the decryption is
  ID key for ELG-E key as well as  some phrase here instead of the
actual phrase given.
All in all things seem good till this point.
 Now tomorrow will be trying with gpg2 , one thing though :-
Mr. Werner Koch had usefully provided the difference between 1.4.6 & 2.0.3
Now in that 1.4.6 had been shown as using ELG-E
while 2.0.3 as using ELG (I guess that's the final) hopefully
shouldn't spring surprises.
 I am sorry if I come out as paranoid but till I don't understand how
things work, I feel its best to be conservative.
