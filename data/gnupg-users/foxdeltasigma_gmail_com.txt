@_subject: Threefish cipher in GnuPG? 
Hello everyone,
I've been sort of a long-term user (everything is relative, I guess) of  GnuPG, mainly sticking to the 1.14.x versions, using them as standalone  inside encrypted volumes, since I usually only do pretty simple stuff,  like messages or files.
I think the Blowfish cipher is included for backward compatibility  (mainly),and I occasionally use Twofish instead of AES256, for symmetric  encryption myself.
Anyway, just out of curiosity, are there plans on including Threefish in  GnuPG? Or reasons why it hasn't been nor will be?
Best regards,
S Trenton
