General info
Subcription/unsubscription/info requests should always be sent to the
 -request address of a mailinglist.
If a mailinglist for example is called "thelist then the
 -request address can be inferred from this to be:
 "thelist-request
To subscribe to a mailinglist, simply send a message with the word
 "subscribe" in the Subject: field to the -request address of that
 list.
As in:		To: thelist-request
To unsubscribe from a mailinglist, simply send a message with the word
 (you guessed it :-) "unsubscribe" in the Subject: field to the
 -request address of that list.
As in:		To: thelist-request
In the event of an address change, it would probably be the wisest to
 first send an unsubscribe for the old address (this can be done from
 the new address), and then a new subscribe for the new address (the
 order is important).
Most (un)subscription requests are processed automatically without
 human intervention.
Do not send multiple (un)subscription or info requests in one mail.  Only one will be processed per mail.
NOTE: The -request server usually does quite a good job in
 discriminating between (un)subscribe requests and messages intended
 for the maintainer. If you'd like to make sure a human reads your
 message, make it look like a reply (i.e. the first word in the
 Subject: field should be "Re:", without the quotes of course); the
 -request server does not react to replies.
Every submission sent to this list is archived.	 The size of the
 archive depends on the limits set by the list maintainer (it is very
 well possible that only, say, the last two mails sent to the list are
 still archived, the rest might have expired).
You can look at the header of every mail coming from this list to see
under what name it has been archived.  The X-Mailing-List: field
 contains the mailaddress of the list and the file in which this
 submission was archived.
If you want to access this archive, you have to send mails to the
 -request address with the word "archive" as the first word of your
 Subject:. To get you started try sending a mail to the -request
 address with the following:
