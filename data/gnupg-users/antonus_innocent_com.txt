I had the same problem, and it works fine with --no-comment, but
I can't change my password in windows PGP6.5.1
Any idea ?

I asked the same question, and answer is :
gpg --export-secret-key --s2k-cipher-algo=CAST5 --s2k-digets-algo=SHA1 --no-comment  > key.asc
gpg --export --s2k-cipher-algo=CAST5 --s2k-digets-algo=SHA1 --no-comment  >> key.asc
under, windows, DnD key.asc in your key manager and that should be enough :)

@_subject: revoke 
I can't revoke a GnuPG key on the keyservers.
I got this :
Public Key Server -- Add
Key block in add request contained no new
keys, userid's, or signatures.
Your key block contained 1 format errors,
which were treated as if the erroneous elements
hadn't been part of your submission.
The last error was on key 0x98c52208:
Key block corrupt: signature without key
Any one knows whats the problem ?
