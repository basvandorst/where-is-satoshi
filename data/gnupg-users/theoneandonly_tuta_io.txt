Hello GnuPG users,
is there a way of OpenPGP based SSH authentification?
I mean, there's a way with the gnupg ssh-auth-agent if I remember correctly.
I was wondering if there's some kind of PAM module or something like this.
I'd like to login to my SSH server with my YubiKey most likely without any other software (except PuTTy (for Win) or the Terminal (on Linux, Mac OS X).
Someone who can share experience in here?
Thanks in advance and best regards

thx for your answer.
What kind of PGP smartcard are you using?
