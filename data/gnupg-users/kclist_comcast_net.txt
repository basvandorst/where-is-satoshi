@_subject: Help for a newby - gen-key error message 
This is a Windows 7 question:
I was able to mouse around in Google and found out how to modify the proper PATH environment variable. Therefore, at the command prompt I'm able to execute gpg without having to migrate to the directory where gpg lives. The good news is that I'm able to run "gpg --version" and get gpg to talk to me. The bad news is that I am getting an error message when I invoke gpg --gen-key at the command prompt. There error is \gpg.conf:5: invalid auto-key-locate list. I've re-installed gpg, but that did not help.
Any ideas for fixing the problem?
Thank you in advance.
