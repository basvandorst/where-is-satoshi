@_subject: Problem with default key 
Because you have not specified a file, GPG tries to read from stdin. Because there is nothing there, you see that message. The --default-key is more for gpg.conf (the name makes more sense in this context) than to be supplied on the command line. If you wish to make the default signing key 0x12345578, add
default-key 0x12345578
to your gpg.conf. As John mentioned, you can override that preference for a particular invocation with --local-user (or -u for short).
Based on your reply to the others' messages, I think your problem is just that you are not giving GPG a file to work with.

You're not allowed to distribute Enigmail (or any other extension)
preinstalled with Thunderbird, so even if you get some other frontend
for GPG, you still have that problem.

@_subject: [admin] What is top posting, and why should you avoid it? 
I think top-posting is common historically because MS Outlook positions the cursor at the beginning of a message by default. Mobile devices with email programs that do this as well (combined with the fact that line navigation is a bit harder on mobile devices) is certainly making the problem worse.

I disagree. An introduction does fit logically at the top, however such an introduction should be short. One does not need to read anything below to get context for an introduction; in fact, such an introduction may be there to put the rest of the message in context.
On a side note, is there any reason I didn't see the last message I sent to the list?

It's part of the prompt string. $ is for a normal user, # for root (this is for Unix-like systems). Your headers indicate that you're using Windows (I have a nifty little extension for Thunderbird that scans headers for MUA information and displays the appropriate logo), so your prompt string will not likely have either. Anyway, don't worry about the $.

Exactly. There are keyloggers (both hardware and software), screenloggers, USB drive copy programs, and a lot of other nasty stuff you'll never see coming. If the copy program picks up your key, and a keylogger or screenlogger picks up your passphrase, your key is compromised.

I don't do this intentionally. That message was threaded (by Thunderbird) with the rest of the discussion. Plus, the resolution is so low on my monitor (not by choice, but by capability) that header info is not displayed properly (it is possible to display this info, but doing so covers what little space there is to read a message). I'm not trying to make excuses, but that's just how it is. I will pay attention to OT messages more. I see that your message had a carbon copy to the list, so I would assume a reply to the list would be fine.

@_subject: Testing a build 
Hash: RIPEMD160
How would one go about making sure everything works? I built GPG for
Windows following the instructions at
 (a link at
gnupg.org/download.html). Unfortunately, I cannot find the libcurl
package mentioned. It says the package is labeled "libcurl" and not
"binary", yet it says there are .dll files in it. I seem to be missing
libintl3.dll (IIRC), which causes dd not to start during configuration,
but I am still able to build GPG (it runs). I did not bother with
libiconv. I've replaced the official binaries with my own (keeping a
backup, of course), and Enigmail seems to be fine, I am signing this
with my binaries. I also changed CFLAGS from
CFLAGS='-O3 -mtune=i386 -march=i386 -mfpmath=387 -mno-mmx -mno-sse
- -mno-3dnow -mno-sse2'
CFLAGS='-O3 -mtune=prescott -march=prescott -mfpmath=sse -mmmx -msse
- -msse2 -msse3 -mno-3dnow'
since my processor supports SSE3.
I have three questions:
How can I make sure everything is working right?
(A bit OT) Will the instruction set change cause any noticeable improvement?
(Also a bit OT) If it's supposed to, how can I make sure it is?

Initial testing (I encrypted a few files symmetrically using 3DES) shows
that Werner's generic build is actually faster. Werner, which version of
gcc do you use (or do you use something else?)?
I used gcc 3.4.5 (anything higher for Windows is in alpha or
experimental AFAIK). Correct me if I'm wrong, but I assume you
cross-compile and use Linux when building GPG for Windows.

up over RAID 0, I'd appreciate some help (off-list of course).

Hash: RIPEMD160
Well, it won't stop you from trying to brute-force guess your password
until you get it right. Of course, depending on what you do remember
about your passphrase, how long it is, how strong it is, and what
tools you use, it could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few
millenia. Other than that, nothing. There are no back doors, no type
of "magic" to get your data back to its original form, nothing. Would
you really want to use a program that would allow for such
capabilities, though? After all, no software is going to be perfect
and definitively know who wants to recover that data.
The feeling is mutual. Microsoft doesn't feel it's necessary to follow
web standards, likely because they want to impose their own
proprietary standards. Thankfully, they have not had much success (we
have the late Netscape to thank for this).
More torches and pitchforks for the rest of us, then.
