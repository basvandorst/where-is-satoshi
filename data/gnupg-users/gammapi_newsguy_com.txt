@_subject: Windows port? 
I have seen that a MS Windows port available as executable. Is the source
also available? What is the build environment on MS Windows? Thanks.

@_subject: gpg with current pgp keys 
Hi all, I just subscribed to the list. I have been using PGP 6.5.2 (on
Windows, 6.5.1 on Linux) so
far and wish to switch to GPG 1.0.1. The problem is that after
importing my public and secret keyrings to gpg, even if the gpg
--list-keys and gpg --list-secret-keys work and the passphrases are
correct, I get:
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "me "
2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 2EAB9451, created 2000-01-03 (main key ID 61ECC81F)
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 2EAB9451, created 2000-01-03
      "me "
gpg: public key decryption failed: unknown cipher algorithm
gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit ELG-E key, ID 1BA77AA6, created 2000-01-07
      "she "
gpg: no secret key for decryption available
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
The OS is CorelLinux (based on Debian). Maybe I am just wasting my
time because GPG is not supposed to work in the conditions
above. Please somebody help. My next problem will be how to make GPG
work under Xemacs/mailcrypt. Thanks!

@_subject: GPG with current PGP keys 
Thanks for all the advice received from the list. Now I can use my old
PGP keys created with PGP 6.5.2 on Windows with my current preferred
configuration: Linux, Xemacs 21.1.8, Mailcrypt 3.5.5, GPG 1.0.1. I was
not able to do so before for a mix of different things, a) I was
testing on messages encrypted with IDEA which is not supported by GPG,
CAST is OK. b) for some reasons mailcrypt does not like passphrases
containing the character  After changing the passphrases for all my
ids everything (seems to)work!

@_subject: loading idea and rsa extensions 
I wish to use the idea and rsa extensions. I compiled idea.c and rsa.c
from the gnupg.org ftp site as from the compilation instructions in
the source, copied idea and rsa in /usr/local/lib/gnupg (default,
never changed), added load-extension rsa and load-extension idea in
.gnupg, and it does not work. gpg --version does not see the new
modules. I read all the related posts I found on the mailing list
archives, as far as I can tell I did everything right, but does not
work. Any help?

Thanks for all comments ... it was simpler than that. I had built gpg
without support for dynamic linking. I rebuilt it and it works fine!

@_subject: Signatures in Mailcrypt 
Hash: SHA1
Does Mailcrypt have a problem with signatures? Signing only is
OK. If I encrypt and sign, when I try to verify the signatures it says
that there is no signed message in the buffer. If I encrypt and sign
it separately, (first encrypt then sign) it verifies the signature OK but if I want to decrypt
the message it says that there is no encrypted message in the
buffer. Maybe I do not understand how things are supposed to work? Thanks!

@_subject: GnuPG for EPOC? 
I wonder whether anybody is thinking to port GnuPG to EPOC32. If
Symbian manages to make EPOC a standard for wireless devices there
will be a large demand for encryption tools, text but also voice.

@_subject: GnuPG for EPOC? 
The development kits for C++, Java and OPL (native epoc basic-like
language) can be downloaded from the Symbian site
 There is a port of PGP 2.6.3 to epoc
( but it is a beta (perhaps frozen) and does not
look like a finished product. I believe GnuPG for epoc would be a terrific
product. Taking myself as an average user, if there were such a thing
as a stable crypto suite for epoc  I would tend to use the desktop PC
more for newsgroups, web and letters to friends, and the handheld
device more for sensitive communications. How would you assess the
resources that a full port would take?
