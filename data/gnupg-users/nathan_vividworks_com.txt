Seems there are a lot of patches that would make gpg compile
out-of-the-box on Mac OS X. Also seems that there is no reason for the
resistance to putting this patches in the distribution.
I can't see how the stupid work arounds needed for Mac OS X are any worse
than the stupid work arounds needed for other OSes. It's purely childish
not to have this program compiling on Mac OS X.

I'm not using zsh on this machine. Unless you're saying tcsh is zsh? Also
I've built gpg on zsh on Linux. Either way it doesn't seem like zsh has
anything to do with this problem...
Ok then who maintains the build system that GnuPG uses? I'll go there and
submit the patches (I'm sure they'd be interested in making it work) then
once the build system works w/ Darwin GnuPG can update their version. Then
all the other gnu tools that have the same bug would be fixed as well.

First, let's not start a shell holy war. Suffice to say noone with any
knowledge of shells would dismiss zsh as crap, especially in comparison to
the Bourne Shell.
Second when a patch has been submitted numerous times to fix a problem on
a particular platform that makes access to that platform a moot point. The
Developer has access to the solution and that is what matters.

K, that makes much sense. I've never thought to change that but I will
right away. Even if it doesn't fix the problem.

That sounds like a good thing. What implication does that have for gnupg
on Darwin?

I replaced /bin/sh on OS X with Gnu Bash and configure works fine. It is
also *much* faster than zsh at running configure.
Now there is a problem compiling, but that sort of thing I can probably
sort out.

@_subject: Piping stdout to more or less? 
This is highly dependant on your shell. tcsh for example pipes both stderr
and stdout together (always). I see you are running an -ac kernel. This
probably means your Linux install is customized. What distro was it, and
what are the versions of your shells?

@_subject: php & gpg & new to linux == frustration :-( 
If it is php it is probably being run by the web server, which may not
have a homedir or its homedir may not be valid (mine is set to /dev/null).

@_subject: Web Server Encrypt 
I'm setting up a cgi to encrypt files for a specific user. I've given the
web server a minimal gnupg installation - it only has the public key
required to encrypt the files. The problem is that gpg insists on asking
"Use this key anyway?". I do not want the web server to have a key pair of
its own. Is there any way to tell gpg to use this key without prompting
me? Even setting trust level to 4 hasn't helped.

You mean --homedir /var/www/data/. It'll manipulate the .gnupg part on
it's own. (What you've told it to do is create
