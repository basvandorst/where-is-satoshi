@_subject: Can I create domain keys? 
I can always create a key for herrprofessor at monsters.edu and send
messages from this address signed with the key. But if I do not control
the domain (or at least a mailbox associated with the address), I will
never receive replies to my forged messages.

@_subject: certificat for a key pair 
Sounds like your MUA supports S/MIME, you need a X.509 cert instead of a PGP keypair.
Kind regards,
