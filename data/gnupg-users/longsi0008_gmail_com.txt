@_subject: Creating Unique Fingerprint 
I am on Linux, and would like to generate a key with "unique 40" fingerprint.
eg 1: Starts with ABCD XXXX ... XXXX
eg 2: Starts with AXXX XXXX ... XXXA ends with A
eg 3: XXXX ... XXXX without any '0' character at all
How would I go about writing such a script? Don't mind running for
months to get these sets.

Hi everyone
Thanks for your input so far. I am surprised to learn about the
suggested methods. For my example 1, I had assumed there would be only
(1/16)^4 combinations so it should be fairly quick (i.e. less than a
week to find one).
Let say for now, I just want my full fingerprint to start with a 'A'.
With a possibility of 1/16, I assumed this should take less than a day
of computing power. Can anyone show me a script to do so?
I wish to have a working key, of course, with my chosen name, email, etc...

@_subject: private-keys-v1.d 
Before migrating to a new system, I exported my GPG secret keys and
then imported them. Both "gpg -k" and "gpg -K" shows both the public
and private keys are imported properly. However, I note my
".gnupg/private-keys-v1.d" directory is empty, and I am unable to sign
my emails with Evolution client, it kept reporting "secret keys not
found". Fortunately, I kept a copy of my old directory and copied the
two (.key) files over and now things are okay. Thus, I like to ask how
do I generate the (.key) files from my exported, armoured text file
created by "gpg --export-secret-keys"? Isn't creating a backup of my
secret key enough to recreate the rest of the necessary files?
