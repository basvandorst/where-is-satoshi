@_subject: How to get my GNUPG Elgamal private key exponent? 
I have tried googling around. The closest solution I get is:
private.key contains the private key file.
$pgpdump -i private.key
But this only gives me the following:
ElGamal p
ElGamal g
ElGamal y
Encrypted Elgamal x
some other information of crypto
It shows the value for p,g,y, but not x. How can I find out the value of x?
