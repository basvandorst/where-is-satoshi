@_subject: OpenPGP cards and on-device subkeys 
Hi there,
I would like to know if it's possible to obtain a setup like the following:
* master key on an OpenPGP smartcard
* an encryption subkey both on smartcard and on disk (laptop, phone etc)
* a signing subkey both on smartcard and on disk (laptop, phone etc)
In the best scenario one would be able to revoke the subkeys and
generate new, without using an off-card copy of the master key, but as
far as I understood that is not possible.

Thanks for the answer, I think I will go for the approach proposed by
Sam Pablo.
I am indeed inclined to use GnuPG 2.1 as much as possible, as I see it
wasteful to have to remember both commands' syntax.
It is not possible to export an on-card subkey, thus I was asking how to
properly do this by having a subkey existing both on-key and off-key,
but possibly never the master key. I estimate a compromise/revocation of
the subkey as affordable, while doing the same for the master key should
be avoided as much as possible through best practices.

If it's the master key then I see it described as "SCA", not just "S".
Unfortunately the procedure to achieve this is everything but simple, as
I noticed that when exporting subkeys gpg does not export the master
signature as well. This was a surprise, but again - maybe I didn't
properly RTFM and use the features right. Some online sources suggest
using gpgsplit to do this correctly.
I would think that the use-case I described is common enough to be
verbosely documented somewhere, but this is not the case; apparently
most people either just keep a copy of the master key on multiple
devices or use some product like yubikey.
I would have preferred a master key that has ever only existed on-card
with expendable subkeys on-card and off-card.
I am currently using a single openpgp smartcard (v2), so this is a bit
disappointing, but I do understand why.

@_subject: Using gpg-agent for git credentials? 
Gnome-keyring and gpg-agent don't play well together in my experience,
as the former tries to implement partially some features of gpg-agent.
I regularly use gpg-agent as my SSH agent, which in turns allows me to
use git over SSH for the integration you described.
