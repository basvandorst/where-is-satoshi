I have found that keys can be found on many server just a few minutes
after uploading them. Just go to a keyserver and search for them.
All the info is shown.

I am just interested. why is your key not available on a keyserver?
Is there something against publishing it on a server?

does anybody know how to make key sign work with Gpa in MDK9.2. Doesn't
work anymore since 9.0. I just cannot sign any keys. Old keys still show
up as signed.
It appears that everything works when I sign a key, but it does not show
as signed after it.
No error messages show up.

That's a good question. I am using the Gui because I am not very good at
command mode and I am not quite certain about the command to use to sign
a key.

Yep, this worked. The key now shows in Gpa as signed.
This means that the permissions in /home/user/.gnupg should be ok?!
Wonder if this is just a bug in Gpa? Thou there hasn't been a new one
around for quite some time.

Gpa ver 0.7 is a hassle to compile. Too many dependency problems in

I installed 0.6.1 as rpm after doing some other Google searches for
gpgme upgrades. Needed gpgme 0.4.0 rpm
This seems to work. Well, I haven't tested everything but signing keys
Thanks a lot Miguel for your help.

It doesn't build on the newest Linux Mandrake 9.2 either, because of
dependency problems. May be the developers should revisit it and port it
back to some older packages? or provide binaries?

I never encountered that problem. But I remember that the permission was
kind of critical.
I just installed MDK 9.2 and the gnupg worked. I use evolution as mail
client. It does it all.
May be you want to add a new user to your Linux box, create a new
signature as this user and then look in /.gnupg what the permissions

Just interested. Why is your key showing up as plain text at the end of your message
instead as a key icon in my evolution? A few of the posters messages
come that way.

Gpa (Gnu privacy assistant) had no problem to find the key CFAFB3DC on the public key server!
Evolution still shows the icon, if the key is not available but when
clicking on the icon, but shows the message:

@_subject: Bug: Unusable key 
I am still trying to learn all these different signature styles. The
inline signatures normally look like this:
Start of signatures
Then text message
Then end of signatures.
But in this case, the whole signature part was at the end of the e-mail
message, where I normally have the signature icon.
The second questions Thomas, you list in plain text GPG KeyID: 114AA85C
which can be found on a public key server, but then your actual
signature on your e-mail has ID BBA8F8F5 and that one cannot be found on
a public keyserver. After downloading your signature with ID 114AA85C,
GnuPG is able to read your signature that contains ID BBA8F8F5
Why is that?
If you would not have listed it in plain text, I would never have found

I think you are right:

Hash: SHA1
I cannot encrypt to my personal key 0xAF351431 today! Maybe it's
because it expires today in the year 2012? The key expires: 2012-02-04
It works OK with my old PGP.

@_subject: restoring ~/.gnupg folder 
This is a different topic, but it looks as if you installed Fedora the
Windows way??: Not partitioning the HD. You should not loose your data
at all (including the Gnupg key) when you reinstall Fedora.
Making a /home partition also lets you easily upgrade later on or
install another Distribution if you get tired of your existing one.(I am
not saying at all that Fedora is not a good one)

Thanks Adrian.
PGP/Mime would make it possible for Evolution users to read the
signatures. Ximian just tells that inline signatures are not RFC
compliant and will not change their program. Around 50% on this list use
inline signatures

Why adding a confidential statement to an e-mail that goes to a mailing
list? Mailing lists must be very confidential?
I believe that e-mail can be intercepted and read by anyone who wants to
and nobody can proof it. Thus, those who are on the address list will be
liable for disclosure! Isn't this asked a little too much?
