@_subject: Shouldn't keyservers store and provide subkeys? 
I suppose I'll chime in here.  I'm finally going to trash PKS in the
coming days, sad but true.  I've been playing around with SKS recently,
and it seems fairly stable.  I'd forgotten about onak, I'll give it a
try as well.  I'll [obviously] let my sync partners know what I
eventually decide to do.
