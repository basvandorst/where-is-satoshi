@_subject: Accessing the 2nd card reader 
Hello everyone,
I have connected two card readers to my computer, but want only to use
the 2nd one with GnuPG 2/scdaemon.
Both are PCSC readers:
$ opensc-tool -l
Readers known about:
Nr.    Driver     Name
0      pcsc       SCM SPR 532 [Vendor Interface] (21250837209929) 00 00
1      pcsc       REINER SCT CyberJack pp_a (8928928328) 00 00
However, GnuPG only recognizes the 1st reader:
$ echo scd getinfo reader_list | gpg-connect-agent --decode | awk
'/^D/ {print $2}'
How can I force GnuPG to use the 2nd reader only? I don't know what
which reader-port option to set in ~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf.

@_subject: Accessing the 2nd card reader 
Hello Werner,
thanks for your advice. I had to use the whole identifier as issued by
opensc-tool to get the reader to work:
reader-port "REINER SCT CyberJack pp_a (8928928328) 00 00"
Now I can finally access my OpenPGP smart card in my second reader using GPG :)
Thanks again for your help,
    Richard

@_subject: Accessing the 2nd card reader 
Well I stumbled upon another problem.
I actually wanted to use one of my card readers with GnuPG/scdaemon
exclusively, and the other one with OpenSC's PAM-PKCS module.
As already mentioned, both of my readers are accessible via PC/SC.
Having set
reader-port "REINER SCT CyberJack pp_a (8928928328) 00 00"
in my ~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf, I thought the other reader could now be
used smoothly with PAM-PKCS However, pcscd tells me
"SCardConnect() Error Reader Exclusive". I'll have to figure out which
the two readers it is trying to access here (although I have set the
reader slot to use to the 1st reader, which should not be opened
exclusively by scdaemon).
I just wanted ask whether scdaemon always blocks _all_ PC/SC readers,
even when told to use one specific reader only?
If it doesn't, then this is probably a PAM-PKCS problem and
I will have to contact the OpenSC people for support.

All right, this appears to be a PAM-PKCS bug. I am going to drop a
note on this list if I find a solution.

That's not correct: It is a bug in OpenSC's PKCS module. Someone
wrote a patch for OpenSC (SVN, trunk), which fixes the problem for me:

@_subject: poldi & unattended authentication 
Hello everyone!
I would like to authenticate using poldi without the need to enter my
PIN. In an old blog posting, they use "auth sufficient pam_poldi.so
try-pin=123456 quiet" in PAM config files the achieve this behavior
( However, this specific
feature seems not to be available with the latest poldi release
(0.4.1) anymore.
Is there another way to authenticate using an OpenPGP smart card, but
without the need of having to enter a PIN?
Since the OpenPGP smart card itself cannot be used without setting an
(at least) 6 characters long PIN, I don't know what to do with the
"try-pin" option removed.
    Richard.

@_subject: How secure are smartcards? 
would it be sensible to encrypt the key on the memory card key using
the encryption key stored on both smartcards? If one smartcard breaks,
you could still decrypt the key using the other card. And since the
secret key for decryption cannot leave the cards, it would be a pretty
secure solution, I guess. :)

@_subject: Migrating to Smartcards 
for security reasons, I have decided to migrate my most important
subkeys to smartcards. I have a number of questions regarding the
a) I've bought two OpenPGP smartcards (v2). Their overprint says they
support "RSA with up to 3072 bit". In the GnuPG 2.0.18 release notes
one change was to "Allow generation of card keys up to 4096 bit". Does
that apply to the OpenPGP v2 card?
b) As far as I know, the cards can only store subkeys, i.e. no primary
key. That way, only decryption, singing and authenticaion will be
possible. If I want to sign other keys, will I have to keep the
primary key somewhere safe off-card?
c) For convenience, I bought two cards which are supposed to store the
same keys. I want to carry one card around with me every day for
mobile use (I also bought an SCR3500 reader for that purpose) and
leave the other one at home in the card reader on my desk. Now the
problem is that the keytocard command can only be issued once, since
it deletes the key from the computer. To copy the keys to both cards,
I would have to backup my secret keys, insert card  issue
keytocard, restore the backup, insert card  issue keytocard again.
Will that cause any problems in later GnuPG use as the cards' IDs are

So it is impossible to use a separate signing subkey if I want to
retain the possibility to sign other keys without keeping an off-card
backup of the primary key? In the past I switched my singing subkeys
every couple of years, keeping my primary key in place.

are you sure about that? Everywhere I read the slots can only be used
for: signing, decryption, authentication. If the signing slot is
filled with the primary key, there is no more room for a singing

Thanks for all your help!
I just noticed that on my mobile computer (running Mac OS X) I am
still stuck with GnuPG 2.0.17 since MacGPG2 has not yet been updated.
I will have to wait for an updated package before I can start moving
my keys to smartcards.

how is that working anyway? Apparently GPG automatically decrypted

@_subject: gpg-agent automatically use passphrase for signing subkey? 
As far as I know every subkey holds its own passphrase (per default,
they are all identical for a given primary key). This means that
passphrase requests are actually not action-based, but key-based.
Please correct me if I'm wrong. :)

100.000 as a one-time investment for breaking into an unlimited number
of OpenPGP smart cards? If I were a government, I would definitely buy
such a machinery... While at the same time, German authorities fail to
break GnuPG's encryption for private keys, given a dictionary attack
doesn't work out. (See
