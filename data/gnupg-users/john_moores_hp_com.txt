@_subject: Error compiling GnuPG 1.4.10 on Sun Solaris - "stdint.h: No such 
Please can you help me with this problem.
I notice that this problem was logged as a bug (Issue  back in December 2009. Unfortunately I cannot see a resolution in the BTS. I've also checked all emails going back to beginning of 2009 but no other mention of this issue found.
My compile attempt gave me the following error:
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.. -I.. -I../include -I../intl   -D_REENTRANT  -g -O2 -Wall -MT estream-printf.o -MD -MP -MF .deps/estream-printf.Tpo -c -o estream-printf.o estream-printf.c
estream-printf.c:52:21: stdint.h: No such file or directory
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `estream-printf.o'
Current working directory /app/dzdsnp/gnugp/gnupg-1.4.10/util
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `all-recursive'
Current working directory /app/dzdsnp/gnugp/gnupg-1.4.10
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `all'
The config.status file shows:
configure:8960: checking for inttypes.h
configure:8981: gcc -c -g -O2  conftest.c >&5
configure:8987: $? = 0
configure:9003: result: yes
configure:8960: checking for stdint.h
configure:8981: gcc -c -g -O2  conftest.c >&5
conftest.c:91:20: stdint.h: No such file or directory
configure:8987: $? = 1
We're compiling on the following platform:
SunOS 5.9 Generic_117171-07 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Fire-V240
I'm sure I've read somewhere ( that on Sun Solaris, the stdint.h is not used / required as this is covered by inttypes.h. Not sure if this is relevant.
Many thanks in advance for your help.
