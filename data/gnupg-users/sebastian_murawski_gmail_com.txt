Hello GnuPG Users!!!
Works  GnuPG with this hardware token. I try to find some solutions to
make this two things working but without success. Is there some manual
to  connect  this two parts. I use Windows XP sp2. I want to change my
PGP to GnuPG but I have only this little problem.
OK now info:
Z:\GnuPG>gpg --card-status
gpg: detected reader `AKS ifdh 0'
gpg: detected reader `AKS ifdh 1'
gpg: pcsc_connect failed: sharing violation (0x8010000b)
gpg: card reader not available
gpg: OpenPGP card not available: b??d og?lny
