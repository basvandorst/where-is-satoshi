@_subject: Problem building gnupg 1.0.1 on Sparc Linux 
I was goofing around with Sparc Linux today and got an Ultra 1 going with
it.  I tried to build gpg, but it's failing on an attempt to link
Anyhow, when I try to build it, it dies with the following errors:
gcc  -g -O2 -Wall  -o mpicalc  mpicalc.o
../cipher/libcipher.a                ../mpi/libmpi.a ../util/libutil.a  -lz
-ldl -lnsl -lgdbm  -lnsl
../mpi/libmpi.a(mpih-div.o): In function `mpihelp_mod_1':
to `__udiv_qrnnd'
to `__udiv_qrnnd'
../mpi/libmpi.a(mpih-div.o): In function `mpihelp_divrem':
to `__udiv_qrnnd'
to `__udiv_qrnnd'
more undefined references to `__udiv_qrnnd' follow
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [mpicalc] Error 1
Any ideas?

Yes, you can.  To get Marius' key:
