I can only speak for myself.  I don't find the 1.4.x / 2.0.x version numbering
thing confusing at all.  They each serve a different purpose and a different
audience.  I note that, currently, 1.4.x needs to be patched to compile in
support for IDEA, while 2.0.x has it, and a lot of other capabilities already
I have compiled both on both GNU/Linux and Win32, and found that, as long as I
have the appropriate libraries, they both will compile and work correctly.  Of
course, I am a programmer, so I am used to separate versions of the same program.
PS:  Sorry David, I hit the wrong button and forgot to check who I was sending

Hash: SHA512
I was wondering if anyone else was having this problem.  I am running an AMD64
arch, and when I try to "emerge notification-daemon", it will not compile
because  libnotify is not present.  If I try to emerge libnotify, it tries to
merge notification-daemon first, and I get the same problem.
When I run:
"emerge --keep-going libnotify", it will not compile because it depends on
More information to follow (I have to reboot to Gentoo, capture what I need and
send it to this OS).
PS:  I was wondering if removing the 'gstreamer' USE flag from
notification-daemon might fix the problem.
