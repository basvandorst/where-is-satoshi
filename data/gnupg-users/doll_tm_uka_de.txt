@_subject: Two Signing keys in one key 
I wonder if this is a legal key:
pub  1024D/AF6650BF 2002-06-03 Mark Doll uid                            Mark Doll uid                            Mark Doll sub  2048g/43E38F97 2002-06-03 [expires: 2003-06-03]
sub  1024D/F115985C 2002-06-03 [expires: 2003-06-03]
I would like to use key AF6650BF for signing other keys only (without an expiring date) and key F115985C for signing mails and 43E38F97 for encrypting mails (the last two keys exipiring after one year).
Export/Import via files works:
dolltest gpg --import mykey
gpg: key AF6650BF: public key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
dolltest gpg --list-key AF6650BF
pub  1024D/AF6650BF 2002-06-03 Mark Doll uid                            Mark Doll uid                            Mark Doll sub  2048g/43E38F97 2002-06-03 [expires: 2003-06-03]
sub  1024D/F115985C 2002-06-03 [expires: 2003-06-03]
but does not work via a keyserver:
dolltest gpg --recv-key AF6650BF
gpg: requesting key AF6650BF from blackhole.pca.dfn.de ...
gpg: key AF6650BF: invalid subkey binding
gpg: key AF6650BF: public key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
dolltest gpg --list-key AF6650BF
pub  1024D/AF6650BF 2002-06-03 Mark Doll uid                            Mark Doll uid                            Mark Doll Will this ever work via keyservers? Or is should I use another method to get seperate keys for signing keys and signing mails?

@_subject: How to select a specific subkey for signing? 
Since the "default-key" option just selects a whole key and not a specific subkey, I currently use a different secret keyring with just the desired subkey in it to "force" signing with that subkey. I wonder if there's a nicer solution to this problem.
P.S.: Here my key as an example:
doll >gpg --list-secret-keys 0xDF2D08D3
sec  1024D/DF2D08D3 2000-02-29 Mark Doll uid                            Mark Doll uid                            Mark Doll ssb  2048g/5524278A 2000-02-29
ssb  1024D/39B20E88 2001-07-19
ssb  2048g/E5BCB023 2001-07-19
ssb  1024D/84BA6C81 2002-06-10
ssb  2048g/6E84ADA1 2002-06-10
GPG chooses 0x84BA6C81, which is alright for normal mail signing. But
for signing other keys with (sub)key 0xDF2D08D3, I use this mutilated doll >gpg --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring keysignring.gpg --list-secret-keys 0xDF2D08D3
gpg: no secret subkey for public subkey 5524278A - ignoring
gpg: no secret subkey for public subkey 39B20E88 - ignoring
gpg: no secret subkey for public subkey E5BCB023 - ignoring
gpg: no secret subkey for public subkey 84BA6C81 - ignoring
gpg: no secret subkey for public subkey 6E84ADA1 - ignoring

Wonderful, that's much better! Thanks! :-)
If this only had been mentioned in the man page...
