You might want to check out the Yubikey guys. They make a yubikey with
an openpgp applet.
And the applet code is here:
Some people should peer review this stuff though. At least the code is FOSS.
I would still prefer a openpgp card though mainly because I trust a
German company more, than a business that also might be harassed by the
US Government.
However, if there is no other way to connect a device like a card
reader, then maybe this would offer an alternative.
As Bruce Schneier said, FOSS is harder to manipulate, so that is a good
thing, and also he warns of US (non US)influence on proprietary
companies. To be honest, I think one now has to take any US business
with a pinch of salt. This of course also applies to other businesses,
which are not located in the US.
All depends on the legal situation and the willingness of companies to
abuse their position, because they are being lobbied by governments. The
usual, do this or we won't offer your products for tendering in the
public sector (government departments), or worse threats where laws
allow that. Or just plain stupidity, thinking they are doing the right
thing, believing all the rubbish they have been fed.

@_subject: Omnikey 3821 with OpenPGP Card and Pin Pad Entry 
Dear All,
I have finally had time to play with the Omnikey 3821 and my OpenPGP
cards. Yesterday, I somehow managed to get the Omnikey reader to accept
pinpad entries. I suspect it was the enable-pinpad-varlen option in
~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf, which did this. This worked for setting the
password on card, but would not accept the password for an Auth Key I
generated, that is expert mode then deselect (E) and (S) to leave the
(A)uthentication bit.
When I now set the enable-pinpad-varlen I keep getting:
debug1: Offering RSA public key: cardno:00050XXXXXXXX
debug3: send_pubkey_test
debug2: we sent a publickey packet, wait for reply
debug1: Server accepts key: pkalg ssh-rsa blen 535
debug2: input_userauth_pk_ok: fp
debug3: sign_and_send_pubkey: RSA
Agent admitted failure to sign using the key.
debug1: Trying private key: /home/blah.....
Also, when I try gpg2 --card-edit, pinentry does not ask me to enter the
pin, with the pinpad showing the request on the Omnikey's LCD screen.
When I remove the enable-pinpad-varlen option from
~/gnupg/scdaemon.conf, pinpad-gtk pops up and asks me to enter the password.
Is there something I missed ? It worked fine yesterday, minus the Auth
pin issue. I was hoping to finally get there with the setup and be able
to use the pinpad for pin entries.
Any insights of you all, would be most appreciated.
If I can provide you with any further output, which might help, let me
know how and what you need, and I will be most happy to oblige.
Thank you in advance.

To answer my own question! After prodding around and searching for
answers, this appears to be an issue with gnupg2.0.22. There is also a
bug filed for it.
I reverted back to an older version, albeit this one does something
weird too.
I will keep prodding that, until I get the error I had earlier, then
send a new email about the issue, or file a bug, depending on what my
findings are.
So, for now please ignore my previous email.
Thank you.

I suggest you contact the package maintainer for Ubuntu's GNUPG2
packages. I have just recompiled Fedora's locally and it fixed my issues
with pinpad entry I was having. I was running 2.0.21 before.
I will email the package maintainer in Fedora to as him to roll another
gnupg2, even if it is just sits in updates-testing for a bit.
If you are not using the pinpad entry on a pinpad based smart card
reader, try setting the pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-gtk-2
option(or whichever pin entry option you prefer), in a file called
gpg-agent.conf, within the gnupg directory.
Hope this helps!

Totally off-topic. But that your father was a highly positioned judge, would make you rather biased.
They do process any US email going in and out of the US, be it by US citizens or not. Also, quite frankly, all of such assurances are totally meaningless, as we in the UK (GCHQ), do that work for you and vice versa. So, you see, the issue is not necessarily that the US government is spying on the German government, or the UK government, and they doing it on each other of course. The real issues are that they are a. violating UK law or US law by sharing information or getting the other party to use that information, which at least in the UK is so unlawful, you would need 50 negative words to describe how unlawful that approach is (according to a former Intelligence and Security Committee member). b. By intercepting any messages, by tapping into POPs or undersea cables you are by de-facto already obtaining communications content without warrants. Because of course that would make it almost impossible for them to gather information otherwise. They would be in court all day long.
Quite frankly though even Germany and many other European governments co-operate in intelligence matters by sharing data on their citizens.
Mrs Merkel was only appalled that her Governments stuff was being spied on, quite frankly I do not think she particularly cares about German citizens or residents.
The fact is, now every citizen can communicate at will, with a lot of people at once, broadcasting their views without having a media organisation filter it, is scaring any executive in the world, be it China, Germany, the Uk, Russia, the US or anyone other country you can think of.
Of course, all terrorists and organised crime people know they are being spied on. So, they already have changed heir tactics, even way before Edward Snowden released the files. That is, not communicate via mobile phones, email, or written letter. We had a prime example here in the UK, where terror suspects, who later got convicted, met in a public park. And that is where they would talk, now the only reason they got caught is, because of the old traditional intelligence gathering methods aka actually surveying the actual targets.
Every time you hear politicians say mass surveillance stops terrorism without showing actual convictions, is rather laughable, especially if that surveillance covers national borders too.
Anyway, enough of this. Pointless discussion really. Only thing you can do is complain to your MP, Congressman/Woman, Member of the Bundestag or maybe even Landtag(Bundesrat), or who/whatever is responsible in your country. Or better yet, unlawfully spy on your politicians, by planting bugs in their constituent offices, tap their mobiles send them malware, tap into their phone lines. Then broadcast all you found on the internet. Including their family affairs, potential conflicts of interest and corruption, including secret deals. They will love that I am sure. Note: This is a bit of sarcasm! We are world renown for that in the UK.
Maybe then they will wise up to why mass interception is not only wrong, but also yields very little real useful information.

Haha. Unfortunately for you, I am not German, so i am not insulted.

Further, getting facts from a second party about a third party about information, that would fall under a piece of legislation, which permits nobody to even discuss it, makes such statements meaningless. Further adding your comments about intelligence matters, that you clearly can not have any knowledge of, does not qualify you to make any such statements. Hence, my statement about you being biased.
Further, all this discussion is quite meaningless anyway. Needless to say all this is totally off-topic, I just wanted to be sure that you got somebody else's opinion, as you were quite so dismissive about another person and their opinions on this list.

I am pretty sure I have seen advice on how to backup and restore your keys, if not on this list, in the countless smartcard how to.
I must admit I have not followed previous threads from you, but you must admit and be fair, that generally most people here are friendly and supportive. But I have seen the topic come up a few times, so maybe this is a security versus usability issue ? But again, I have not followed exactly what your problem is. Just wanted to point out that most people are reasonably helpful and friendly. Labelling gnupg as crap is, not exactly a fair assessment I think, and falls within the lines of labelling selinux crap, because people do not understand it/are confused by what is going on.

Further, to the previous question, which distribution are you currently
using ? There is a locking issue in Fedora with pcscd. I have not had
time to dig deeper yet, but libvirt and some other binaries appear to be
blocking the card.
Temporary fix is to add a sudo line to restart pcscd or to disable the
affected binaries, which might not be desirable.
I will be looking into this further soon, just have some other work and
also travel for work approaching, so I have not had much time yet.

Find out where your library for libpcsclite is, then run lsof on it like below:
lsof /usr/lib64/libpcsclite.so.1.0.0
lsof: WARNING: can't stat() fuse.gvfsd-fuse file system /run/user/1000/gvfs
      Output information may be incomplete.
COMMAND   PID USER  FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF    NODE NAME
libvirtd 3461 root mem    REG  253,2    47896 1081788 /usr/lib64/libpcsclite.so.1.0.0
pcscd    3462 root mem    REG  253,2    47896 1081788 /usr/lib64/libpcsclite.so.1.0.0
upowerd  3606 root mem    REG  253,2    47896 1081788 /usr/lib64/libpcsclite.so.1.0.0
You will probably get output similar to this. Then  you can kill the pids, of the processes that are blocking the card.
However, as I said, add systemctl restart pcscd a s a sudo option, which should be much easier and not interfere with the other processes.
I hope this helps.

Maybe you could contact a supplier and ask them how much they would
want, if they order one for you.
However, then they will charge you RRP as a bare minimum, probably more,
as you asked them for it.

The whole point of using crypto is, to make it virtually impossible to

This sounds like a bit of an issue I had with my Omnikey 38xx. I had a similar issue, where it always claimed the pin was wrong. I installed the omnikey drivers.... and then restarted PCSD. But I was using the pinpad on the device itself. Maybe your issue is different, depending on your hardware.
