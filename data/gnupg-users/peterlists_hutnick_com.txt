@_subject: Integrated GnuPG use with MS Outlook 
Does anyone know of a way to use GnuPG with MS Outlook?  The only thing I could find is the G DATA GnuPG-Plugin.  The download link at  doesn't go anywhere.
Can anyone vouch for this thing?
Better yet, is there an option out there that I missed?

Okay, here's the thing . . .
My Dad uses Outlook (I use KMail :-P  ) and he /has/ to use Outlook or the world will end or something.
I'm familiar with WinPT, and it is definitely something.  But Dad, bless him, needs stuff to be real simple.  All that cutting and pasting; we'd have to break down and put him in the home.
It's funny, he's actually made his living in the computer field for 30+ years (He worked on an automated payroll system in Viet Nam!) but you put him in front of windows and he is a gibbering idiot.
But then, can you blame him?
In spite of this he continues to believe that windows is the One True business Soooo, I'm fighting the good fight on the windows front, but I have to pick my battles.  I want him off of windows, but I /need/ him on PGP.
It looks like PGPi freeware will do the trick, but I'd rather push Free (BTW, are Good Works required for Sainthood in the Church of EMACS?  I /think/ I am pure, now that I have the accursed Pico off my system!  The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world that Pine and Pico are Free Software!  Thank God for GNU nano!)
Still looking for suggestions.
Thanks Again,
