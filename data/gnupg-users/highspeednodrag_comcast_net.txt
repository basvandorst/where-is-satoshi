@_subject: Changing the email address on an existing key...how? Should I? 
Is it possible (or advisable) to change the email address on an existing pgp I'm using GnuPG 1.4.1 on Linux. The man pages do not show how to change or edit the mail address of an existing key.
I've had the key(s) a long time and friends use them. I use the same key on several platforms. It would not be too much hassle for me to just create another key with the correct mail address and distribute the public key.
What is good practice in this regard and where might I read more about it?
Or, should I just add a user ID to my existing key so several mail addresses are included in one key?

@_subject: About FIPS 
Hi all,
I think there was a question earlier about FIPS.
  "Does the program have a FIPS-140-2 validation?" was the question I If the software/system is not on this list...
...then it's not FIPS validated.  Thats it. So... you can't use
GPG in any Federal market is the way I interpret this. At least in situations where FIPS validation is required.
Any other perspectives on this? I would _like_ to see GPG on the FIPS approval list.
