@_subject: docs on GnuPG vs PGP 
My apologies, but I had to bring this out.
The matter is about the drop out of the chapter dealing with GnuPG and pgp2 interoperability from the manual.
As I understand it, the reason for dropping this chapter out is that it
would be dealing with patented algorithms, and that crashes with FSF's
Agreed ... to a point.  To the point that everything that's being
offered is information on "how to deal with" ... how to communicate with
people using a non-free cryptosystem.  If there was no movement towards
explaining how to import msword/wperfect/... docs with a free word
processor, or excel spreadsheets, or ...
Well, to be fair, that's not all that was being offered, but also the
posibility of installing rsa.c and idea.c for use within GnuPG (1).  That
may make the drop out of the chapter (section) meaningful.
And yet, information on this issue is still highly required by users.
Not only pgp2, but also pgp5, and lately pgp6 compatibility with GnuPG
is an important issue.  I'm not saying that GnuPG should try to be more
compatible with, or should implement this or that for compatibility
sake, that's up to the developers to decide.  All I'm saying is that, if
some degree of interoperability already exists, why should it be treated
as if it were some kind of taboo?
Since issue (1) may be a reason enough not to include the section in the
manual (as the manual will be GPLed), then there's still a need for an
"aside guide" covering these aspects.  Not only Kyle Hasselbacher's
recent document on "GPG compatibility with PGP 2.x", but also Caskey L.
Dickson's old document on "PGP 5.x conversion to GnuPG", or any other
related forthcoming issue(*).
Well, that was just my opinion, and not a matter of faith for me.  So,
please, don't throw me overboard if you feel I'm wrong, just tell me so.
By no means do I intend to start a political debate here.
(*) these issues may be related to pgp6, or certifying authorities, or
any other.
p.d.  if installing and using rsa.c and idea.c ith GnuPG may be
illegal, wouldn't it be the same if using pgp2?

Hold on... we're just going round and round this issue, and the answers
are always the same: ``install rsa.c and idea.c modules, and *you'll be

Well, this is not quite so.  You will, indeed, be able to decrypt pgp2
enciphered messages, plus verify pgp2 signatures, plus...
But, ¿does this mean a pgp2 user will be able to decrypt (or verify) a GnuPG encrypted (signed) message?  ... If the data treated with DSA/EG
keys, it sounds obvious that pgp2 will be unable to deal with it ...
¿or?  well, or you might encrypt (sign) the message with GnuPG, but
using an RSA key and IDEA for encryption...
but this means you ALREADY HAVE A RSA KEY, which you previously
generated with pgp2, since GnuPG, for all I know, WILL NOT GENERATE RSA
keys regardless the rsa.c and idea.c modules.
This is not just a GnuPG-pgp2 issue, it's also a pgp5-2 issue, since
most >pgp5 versions don't use RSA.

mutt does indeed.  Other than that, there's the pgp_replyencrypt (and

Most definately not.  I use GnuPG for signing quite often, and
encrypting rarely, and don't have those problems.  But then again, my
mailer is mutt!
I'd say so... or the user's fault.
Since you're using o.e. yourself, and you're not having those problems,
check your configuration and compare it with your friends'.

check your configuration and compare it with your friends'.

I saw a posting on a supposedly system-independent pgp list in Spanish
(well, you know, independent but just windoze and pgp-nai talk), and I
found it puzzling.
The poster complained that, after having sent his public key to a CA
(namely Thawte) they returned his key (previously uploading it in a
keyserver) not just signed, but with an extra uid.  Never gave thought
to this, but checking through my pubring I found this to be common
practice (I thought CAs were just about signing keys).
The explanation Thawte allegedly gave was the following:
" The PGP manual is misleading, I'm afraid. Anybody can create any
" identity for any key and sign it. Just like anybody can associate any
" name with any key in an X.509 certificate. The PGP formats are
" documented in a series of RFC's, and anybody who writes software
" compliant with those RFC's could do this. Now, to "self-sign" the Thawte
" Freemail member identity is impossible without your private key. That's
" why the "Thawte Freemail member" identity is signed by Thawte.
Oh well, the guy was angry as he was sure he only sent his public key in
first instance.  But please, read on:
" In theory, we could issue a revokation certificate for our signature on
" that identity, but this would mean that we'd need to develop support for
" a new format of PGP signature, and we don't have any plans to do that
" right now. Perhaps if corporates start to use PGP there will be demand
" for revokation in the PGP format.
Mmmmh... perhaps someone should tell these guys there's no need to
reinvent the wheel ... or is this not possible with GnuPG?  Ha!  if I'm
right there's room here for some fun here.
" The "Thawte Freemail Member" identity does not alter or change your key
" in any way. It is just another identity certificate associated with the
" key. People who do not trust Thawte will not see that as a valid
" identity.
Vaya, vaya... I'm a bit confused now.  I haven't paid much, if any,
attention to CAs so far, but this sounds to me like key "screwing".
Now, the Spanish guy goes on saying he's absolutely sure he *did not
give away his secret key*, but concerned about having compromised his
key through "signing and sending back to Thawte a small hexadecimal
string generated during the certification process".

that can deal with both sending the new and old ways is helpful.
In any case you still need to know beforehand which way the receiver's mailer can handle, and that makes sending signed mails to mailing lists pretty pointless.

The problem comes when sending sig'ed mail to mailing lists, there you
can't have it right for everyone.  But then again, some people have
their own crussade against sending sig'ed mail to mailing lists.
As I said earlier on this message (and on my other message as well) mutt
handles both.  Therefore, why don't you declare broken any mailer which
does not implement any of them?  Sounds a bit fairer to me.
Of course, everyone's opinion is its own one, and it makes sense that
you stand by it.

Someone said recently that OpenPGP standard was based on PGP 5.x, but
being the standard newer than the system version, the latest would
obviously not be fully compliant with the standard.  Fair.  Anyone dares
to give his/her view on why PGP 6.x is not OpenPGP compliant?

Anyway, not how to turn it off but how to bind signing with application/pgp with GnuPG to + key:
macro   compose \CP     "Fgpg --clearsign\ny"
or with PGP:
macro   compose \CP     "Fpgp +clearsig=on -fast\ny"
and expect mutt users who get signed mail from you to have procmail

PGP/MIME is no problem, may be the problem is that either pine doesn't
handle it well or you haven't configured it to handle it properly.
Mutt parses both PGP/MIME and application/pgp well, and I see no trouble
with it.
For instance, Cristopher's sig output:
[-- Salida de PGP a continuación (tiempo actual: Thu Mar 16 09:26:04
2000) --]
gpg: Signature made jue 16 mar 2000 01:41:14 CET using DSA key ID
gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
[-- Fin de salida PGP --]
[-- Lo siguiente esta firmado con PGP/MIME --]
whereas yours:
[-- Salida de PGP a continuación (tiempo actual: Thu Mar 16 09:30:12
2000) --]
gpg: Signature made jue 16 mar 2000 01:52:33 CET using DSA key ID
gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
[-- Fin de salida PGP --]
[-- PRINCIPIO DEL MENSAJE FIRMADO CON PGP --]
So, where's the big difference?  Your mailer could make the difference,
of course :)
