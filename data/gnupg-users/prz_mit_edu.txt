@_subject: GnuPG and the OpenPGP.org web site 
I just updated the download section of the openpgp.org web site.  It had not been updated for about two years.  It really needs more links for more source code.  If anyone wants to send me info about other products or projects in the openpgp arena, I could use the help.  -prz
