@_subject: Decryption Error [don't know]:invalid packet (ctb=60) 
I am attempting to decrypt a new file and keep getting this error
message.  I am able to decrypt the file successfully using WS_FTP
Professional and the same key, but cannot using GPG.  How can I
determine what is causing the problem.  I am new to using this tool, but
we are successfully using it for other files.
