Or better yet, use some good security practices like setting up a
default-deny system (on one's own computer), especially if running
Windows. Most non-exclusive computers (i.e. machines that are shared
among, say, a group of employees, or a school/university/work machine,
as well as public terminals) have adequate protection (like not
allowing root or near-root access to just anyone, or something like
Clean Slate (the computers at my school allowed admin access, but the
hard drives were rewritten upon reboot unless the program was
disabled)). As far as I know, malware is pretty harmless without
elevated privileges.

I think I understand after doing a little research as suggested. Only
the hash is signed, and only the key (for the symmetric encryption) is
encrypted with the public key, and the message itself is encrypted
symmetrically. The recipient unlocks the symmetric key with the
private key that corresponds to the public key with which it was
encrypted and can then decrypt the message. Large file sizes aren't an
issue because the files (or messages) are encrypted symmetrically,
which is much more efficient than encrypting them directly
asymmetrically. Right?

Which is probably even less secure. In order to compromise a
PGP-encrypted message (without breaking the encryption), one must have
the private key and passphrase. In order to compromise Hushmail, one
only needs the passphrase, which is easier to obtain remotely. The
former requires a silent keylogger, knowledge of the key's existence,
and a program that will silently copy the key. The former requires an
IE data miner (not uncommon) unless the caf? owner has another browser
like Firefox or Opera, or allows users to use a portable browser like
Firefox Portable. A keylogger would work for the latter as well.

The last 3 generations of optical discs (CD -> DVD -> HD-DVD/Blu-Ray)

each generation didn't care about supporting the previous. Even as

I do agree, though, that an electronic storage medium won't beat paper

It's not in the path.
Unlike Mac OS X, installed programs have the executable in their own
little directories. There isn't a central directory for executables
(like /usr/bin) that would be set as a path.
You can:
 - add the directory in which gpg.exe exists to %path% (I forget the
directory since I don't use the standard directory in %programfiles%)*
 - copy gpg and the other related executables to a directory already
in %path% (e.g. %windir%\system32)
One way to do the recommended action is to go to Control Panel ->
System -> Advanced -> Environment variables. From there, you need to
modify the %path% variable. This is located under System Variables.
Just add a semicolon followed by the directory where GPG is. This
modifies the path for all users and requires admin rights. You can add
the directory specifically for the current user by adding a variable
named "Path" (if it doesn't already exist) to User Variables and
setting it to %path%;[GPG directory].
There is also the set command, but I'm not sure if it modifies the
user's path or the system's path.
