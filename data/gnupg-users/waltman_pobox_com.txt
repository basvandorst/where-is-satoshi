Gnus has mailcrypt hooks, and mailcrypt supports GnuPG.

Or you can just download the current gnupg tarball and use the
options.skel inside there.

@_subject: GPG wants to check trustdb every day 
I'm running version 1.2.4 of gpg, from the Debian's 1.2.4-4 package of
gnupg.  Several days ago I noticed that gpg suddenly wants to start
rechecking the trustdb every single day.  Prior to this, it was just
checking it every month or so.
Here's the output from "gpg --check-trustdb":
% gpg --check-trustdb
gpg: public key 98645519 is 43099 seconds newer than the signature
gpg: checking at depth 0 signed=86 ot(-/q/n/m/f/u)=0/0/0/0/0/1
gpg: public key 98645519 is 43099 seconds newer than the signature
gpg: checking at depth 1 signed=257 ot(-/q/n/m/f/u)=22/0/0/54/10/0
gpg: public key 98645519 is 43099 seconds newer than the signature
gpg: checking at depth 2 signed=628 ot(-/q/n/m/f/u)=134/0/0/0/0/0
gpg: next trustdb check due at 2004-12-27
As far as I know I haven't changed anything.  /usr/bin/gpg was last
changed on 2004-02-23, and ~/.gnupg/options was changed on 2003-07-30.
I've tried running "gpg --rebuild-keydb-caches" but that didn't help.
Anyone know what else might be causing this?

I don't know how to determine that, but judging from the other keys
around it in the output of "gpg --list-keys" I'd say it was sometime
in 2000 or 2001.  I've noticed those sorts of error messages before
but they never seemed to cause any problems.
I'm doubtful, since it's been on my keyring for years without any

Well, I didn't change anything, and I just verified a signature that
forced today's check of the trustdb.  Interestingly, this time it said
that the next trustdb check is scheduled for December 30.  A check
every 3 days beats a check everyday, but I'd still rather have the old
once-a-monthish behavior.
Does anyone know what the formula is that gpg uses to decide when the
next check is supposed to be?  Everything I've been able to find
online has been pretty vague.

Aha!  That explains it.  I must just have a bunch of signatures
expiring around the end of the year.
