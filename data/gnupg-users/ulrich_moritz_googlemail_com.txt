@_subject: How to open Windows GPG encrypted files on Mac OS X 
============================== START ==============================
we recently had some problems with TextWrangler and GPGServices (most likely a problem with the handling of different line-endings in TextWrangler and/or GPGServices). Please try to decrypt the encrypted text using the standard TextEdit.app of OS X.
If that fails too and if you still have access to the windows system, could you try to send an encrypted text. My public key has the keyID 59B34B61 and the key of the GPGTools team has the ID 00D026C4.
Kind regards,
Moritz Ulrich
