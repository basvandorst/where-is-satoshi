@_subject: scripts and include directories missing in 1.0.6 
The scripts/ and include/ are missing in gnupg-1.0.6.tar.gz, preventing compilation.  Gpg compiles just fine if I use gnupg-1.0.5 and the 1.0.6 patch file.

Well, this is odd.. I originally downloaded the file from  but now that I download it again today, all the files are indeed included.  Sorry for the false alarm.
