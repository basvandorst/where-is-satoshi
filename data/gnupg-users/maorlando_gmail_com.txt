@_subject: [admin] postings from non-subscribers 
The flip side is someone who wants a quick answer to a limited issue but
otherwise has no interest in participating in (or using email rules to
filter out) every single conversation on a given topic. Personally, I
clicked one of the reply-to addresses in the archive from a google
search, wrote a message, got a notice that it was being moderated, and
then decided to sign up. If I had been told my message was rejected
because I wasn't a subscriber, I might not have bothered going any
further. Barriers to entry should be reduced not reinforced imo.
More kudos to the admins!

@_subject: gpg4win --gen-key fails to connect to IPC when using --homedir 
Hash: SHA256
I had to do two things to solve this:
1: use absolute paths for the homedir. E.g.:
    gpg --homedir "C:\users\me\test\gpg" --gen-key
2: kill any existing GnuPG agents with task manager, and then start one
manually using the same homedir:
    gpg-agent --homedir="C:\users\me\test\gpg" --daemon
After you're done, kill the agent you started.
