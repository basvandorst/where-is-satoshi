I used the information in this article :
If there are errors or omissions I'd be interested to learn, as the

Good to hear it, thank you.
Crypto is one of those areas where it is easy to make a mess of things,
so I think it's best to leave it to the experts. The problem then, of
course, is determining who can be judged expert.

I just set up a free hushmail account, using the web interface you don't
get an In-Reply-To field in the header.
I couldn't find any settings which would enable this.
So, if you're using a free hushmail account then I guess you're going to
continue breaking threads.
If you're a premium user then you can use pop and/or imap and a
different mail client.

I've installed enigmail using apt-get, as recommended by Debian -
otherwise not much point in a .deb package, and it works perfectly.
The advantage of installing this way is that it is installed for all
users and both IceApe and IceDove take advantage of the same installation.

@_subject: Looking for simple wrapper for symmetric key file encryption 
I use ecryptfs, as packages are available for my distro (Debian) which
make it easy to install and use.
I wouldn't like to make any claims about "best practice", for the most
part I rely on defaults provided by more knowledgeable folks than myself.

Just as a point of interest
I know of somebody who had 1234 issued as their PIN for a UK bank
account (it IS as random a selection as any other 4-digit number).
