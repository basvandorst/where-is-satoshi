It's about the randomness/unpredictability/entropy of the passphrase.
There are less grammatically correct sentences with 4 words than there
are combinations of 4 words in total.
So, yes, you can take a sentence that makes sense, but then the whole
passphrase has to be longer. There is an estimate of 1.5 bit of entropy
per character in natural language. So if you want a passphrase with 60
bits of entropy, it would need to be 40 characters long. You could reach
the same strength with 10 random characters (alphanumeric with upper and
lower case).
In the end it depends what you can remember better and what you can type

do you have an estimate on the number of unique sentences published on
the Internet?

Yes. To know if picking a random, but previously published sentence (no
matter the length) may ever be good enough. And then maybe going on to
see if two random, but previously published sentences might be good
enough (-:

CryptoParties are a good start from an educational standpoint.
Whiteout.io and Pixelated are a good start from a technological
I think running Pixelated in a GAMP-certified environment would be a
giant leap (very intentional) towards more confidential doctor-patient
communication ? and also a quite solid business model.

Yeah, no. Nothing related to OpenPGP can be done within seconds. Because
key managment. Because of key generation. Because the key material for
this app is stored exactly where? How is this a "cross-compatible
OpenPGP user interface" in a way that Enigmail is not, except that
Enigmail uses the native key managment facilities and is thus at least
more cross-compatible than the suggested solution?
Also OpenPGP en- and decryption does not happen in a vacuum. You don't
go like "Oh, lets just quickly encrypt that GIF to a random public
key.". There is a reason why most of the projects I suggested do email.
But I also suggested OpenKeyChain and I forgot I mean  is not obfuscated (except
the first line, I don't know what that is about). It's just 45000 lines
of code.

@_subject: [HowTo] use gpg2.1 with an onion service 
With the upgrade to GnuPG 2.1 my GPG+Tor setup broke. This was due to the fact that GnuPG now relies on dirmngr to handle all its networking. Which is good, because it separates different parts of functionality, but it also cost me some time to figure out.
In the end, it?s very easy:
1. You create a 2 line script, which calls dirmngr with torify:
user at computer:~$ cat /home/user/bin/tordirmngr.sh  /bin/sh
torify dirmngr --daemon --homedir /home/user/.gnupg
2. You write the keyserver, which preferably is an Onion Service, because as such you can be sure that you connect to it via Tor, with the just created script into your ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf:
dirmngr-program /home/user/bin/tordirmngr.sh
keyserver hkp://euggdcsexz2dqbwb.onion
keyserver-options no-honor-keyserver-url
2.b. For good measure I would also add:
keyid-format 0xlong
After you?re done, run "killall dirmngr" once, so that already existing, not torified, dirmngr processes are not used accidentally.
Please be aware that, while this adds a lot of anonymity and confidentiality to you GPG usage, if you were to refresh your whole keyring at once, the operator of the keyserver might very well figure out who you are.
And please be further aware that most Linux distribution still ship GnuPG 1 and 2 in parallel, so make sure you invoke it with gpg2 (e.g. gpg2 --search glutenfree at vemail.nerd).

@_subject: Should I be using gpg or gpg2? 
The other, and in my opinion much more sensible, course of action would be to migrate all these systems that still use 1.4 to 2.1. Version numbers are like entropy: They only increase, never decrease.
