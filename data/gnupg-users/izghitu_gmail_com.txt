@_subject: key generation problems 
I have CentOS 5.5 with gnupg 1.4.5.
I am using the following command to generate the keys:
echo LinuxMasters | /usr/bin/gpg --homedir /home/USER/.gnupg -e -a -r
email at domain.com > /somefile
The problem I am facing is that until today all the keys generated
using this command had the same size of 1261 bytes and were working
Now when I do it the keys have the size of 912 bytes and no longer work.
Absolutely nothing changed config related on the server.
If I need to send you more info regarding my configs please tell me
what and I will send.
So my question is, why is this happening?
Please help
