@_subject: modifying a keys preferences 
Is there a way to change some of the preferences in a your own key pair?
 For example: I have a key pair originally created in pgp6.5.1 -- it has
symmetric algorithm preferences CAST5, IDEA, and 3DES. Now I import it
into gpg and would like to change the preferences to TWOFISH and CAST5. I
tried deleting the self-signature, and re-signing but that just creates a
signature without any preferences.

@_subject: Verifying multiple detached cleartext sig's 
Let's say you have a file which needs to be signed by multiple people. One
thing to do is have each person create an individual detached cleartext
signature, and then put all of them into one signature file.
* In pgp6.5.1 if you verify such a file it will automatically verify all
  of these signatures.
* However, as far as I can tell, in gpg (up through v0.9.11), only the
  first signature is verified.
Perhaps this could be changed so that all signatures in a given file are
automatically verified?  -Todd Brooks

@_subject: 3des symmetric encryption 
Has anyone tried using pgp to decrypt a 3des encrypted file made in gpg -- Or visa versa.  I use cipher-algo=3des, compress-algo=1, digest-algo=sha1,
when encrypting.  pgp doesn't like my key when decrypting.  Using gpg --list-packets, I get for the gpg-encrypted file:
:symkey enc packet: version 4, cipher 2, s2k 3, hash 1
:encrypted data packet:
:compressed packet: algo=1
:literal data packet:
If I encrypt a file using pgp, I get the identical symkey enc packet, but
gpg won't successfully decrypt this either.
Using CAST5 (everything else the same) works fine between gpg and pgp.
Any ideas as to what is at fault?  -Todd Brooks

@_subject: Importing GnuPG private key into PGP? 
By default, I think GnuPG encrypts your secret key using the Blowfish
symmetric algorithm. PGP will only understand 3DES, CAST5, or IDEA
symmetric algorithms. The following method works for me:
$ gpg --s2k-cipher-algo=CAST5 --s2k-digest-algo=SHA1 --compress-algo=1 \
 --edit-key username
then use passwd to change the password (just change it to the same thing,
but it will encrypt the key with CAST5 this time).
Now you can export it and PGP should be able to handle it. -Todd

@_subject: IDEA 
I know this problem. When you create a key pair, algorithm preferences are
saved along with it. When GnuPG creates a key pair, the prefences are:
"Use the Twofish algorithm if available, otherwise use CAST5, and only if
you can't do that, use 3DES".  The bug is in PGP:  It doesn't understand what TwoFish is (There is no
standard descriptor for Twofish in the OpenPGP specification yet). So it
prints "IDEA" in the key properties box.
BUT, when it come to actually encrypting the message, PGP works correctly:
It uses CAST5 just like it should, so you will be able to unencrypt it in
GPG just fine: IDEA is never actually used.

The only way I know to change the preferences used for key generation is
to rebuild gpg (you can edit g10/keygen.c near line 86 to change the key
preferences). It might be nice to add a feature so that an advanced user
can choose the various preferences without having to rebuild.
In key edit mode (gpg --edit-key), the preferences of a key can be
displayed using the "pref" command.  -Todd

@_subject: GNUPG and PGP FreeWare 6.5.3 
There is no need to leave the password empty when exporting a GnuPG secret
key! By default, GnuPG encrypts the secret key using the Blowfish
algorithm, and PGP 6.5.3 does not understand this algorithm.
Here is a much more secure solution:
1. % gpg --edit-key --s2k-cipher-algo=CAST5 --s2k-digest-algo=SHA1 \
       KEY-ID
2. Change the password (but not to an empty password!). You can just
    change it to what is was before, but gpg will re-encrypt the key
    using an algorithm pgp will understand.
3. % gpg --export-secret-key --no-comment KEY-ID > key.asc
   % gpg --export --no-comment KEY-ID >> key.asc
4. Import key.asc into pgp and everything should work fine!
P.S. Hmmmm...I don't know why the --no-comment option is necessary now...I
     seem to recall not needing to use this in the past.
P.P.S.  Perhaps this procedure should be added to the documentation or
        some sort of FAQ? I seem to recall a PGP5-GnuPG HOWTO which
        mentions the method of exporting an un-encrypted secret (which is
        fine if you are very very very careful), but I think it is better
        to never have to write your un-encrypted secret key to disk. Todd L. Brooks

Any cipher algorithm in your key preferences that pgp doesn't support will
show up as IDEA. Any key generated with GnuPG (regardless of whether you
disable all those algorithms in your .options file), will have public key
preferences of TWOFISH then BLOWFISH then CAST5. PGP won't understand
this, so in the key info box it says IDEA. However, when actually
encrypting to this key, pgp does the right thing: since it doesn't
understand twofish and blowfish, it will encrypt with CAST5.
