Hello list
I'm having major headaches with Gpg, namely:
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available I get this when i try to read an email that has been encrypted to me. I
have their public key, and they have mine. I can see my pubkey and
seckey in ~/.gnupg and gpg is suid root. It also happens if I send an
(encrypted) email, then go to read the email in sent items. I have default-recipient-self uncommented in gpg.conf
There are plenty of instances on google quoting gpg: decryption failed:
secret key not available but these seem to be in relation to 3rd party
products. The problem I am having I can replicate on the commandline.
The system is freebsd 4.7-Rp2 and gpg is:
bash-2.05b$ gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 1.2.1
