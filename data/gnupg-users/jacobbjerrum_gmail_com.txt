dear forum.
I am using GnuPG on my mac.  had a problem and had to reinstall
everything... lost all data. from old backup i have some info on my key. The trustdb was created and so
on, and i have a fingerprint for my pub key, "uid" and "sub". however i dont
know what this means?!
Is there any way i can recover my private key?

Thanks so much! i really think it worked
you where right! i did cat secring.asc and it returned my private key!
That was the right command i think!!
does anyone have the time to test it with me? see - i'm kinda of semi nerdy
and really dont know anyone who sends encrypted files... i justed wanted
this stuff to work so that i have the skill and posibility to use it when it
is needed!

ps: i did get some warnings on the way, dont know what it really means;
gpg: WARNING: key ECABF51D contains preferences for unavailable
gpg:          algorithms on these user IDs:
gpg:          "Test three (no pp) ": preference for

dont hope the secring.asc file was just a "demofile" of some sort?!

Once again! Thanks you guys for helping me out!
You are right, john and I already tested it, i had to send the public key to
him by mail though. He could find it on the key server... hmmm?! which is
strange since i think i uploaded it at some point in time.
my private key starts with the following:
This is a test secret keyring simply stored by GNUPG so that it is easier to
make diff files.  sec   XXXX/XXXXXXX 2003-12-31 Test one (pp=def)  ssb   XXXX/XXXXXXX 2003-12-31  sec   XXXX/XXXXXXX 2003-12-31 Test two (no pp)  ssb   XXXX/XXXXXXX 2003-12-31  sec   XXXX/XXXXXXX 2003-12-31 Test three (no pp)  How come it has those example mails there?!
Hm. I'm starting to think that i may be better of starting over again?!
Maybe it is easier if I just try to generate a new key!? I don't know what
went wrong when i uploaded to the keyserver?!
do you all use IDEA?! if it is not commonly used i dont think i'll try and
get it. Enough work to get the standard algorithm working for me ;)
Again: do you think it would be better for me to just start over?!
And by the way... why do you all sign your messages here? I'm not sure i
have understood the signing idea completely? it is to make sure that the
reader knows the sender is the person he/she says he/she is!? right!?
hope you are all enjoying the weekend!
