My system is Arch linux.
Linux myhost 4.4.1-2-ARCH  SMP PREEMPT Wed Feb 3 13:12:33 UTC 2016 x86_64
gnupg 2.1.11-1
gpgme 1.6.0-2
libgpg-error 1.21-1
I have a problem with comparing contents of publick key ascii files from two
1. downloaded from web page .asc file
$ cat 0xC65285EC.asc
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v2
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
$ gpg --import 0xC65285EC.asc
gpg: key C65285EC: public key "trava90 " imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
$ gpg --check-sigs C65285EC
gpg: 2 good signatures
gpg: 1 signature not checked due to a missing key

sig!         C65285EC 2015-03-15  trava90 2. downloaded from key server .asc file
$ gpg --delete-keys C65285EC
$ gpg --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys C65285EC
gpg: key C65285EC: public key "trava90 " imported
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
$ gpg --check-sigs C65285EC

pub   rsa2048/C65285EC 2015-03-15 [SC]

sig!         C65285EC 2015-03-15  trava90 $ gpg --armor --output 0xC65285EC-key-server.asc --export C65285EC
$ cat 0xC65285EC-key-server.asc
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v2
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Note the difference in output from 'gpg --check-sigs C65285EC':
case 1.
gpg: 1 signature not checked due to a missing key
case 2.
gpg: 2 signatures not checked due to missing keys
Both .asc files represent the same public key, and when imported into gpg,
correctly verify a signed app executable.
But when I compare them, they differ:
$ diff 0xC65285EC.asc 0xC65285EC-key-server.asc
< d2luZUBwcm90b25tYWlsLmNvbT6JATcEEwEIACEFAlUGFsQCGwMFCwkIBwIGFQgJ
< =EkJT
Where is the problem ?
The --export option to .asc entry ?
The --import option from key server entry ?
Something about the key stored on key servers (I imported it from two
with the same result) ?
Anything else ?

Please disregard the above warning note - I received the missing keys from
key servers and verified the signatures.
Some additional data:
pgp.mit.edu lookup result:
Search results for 'trava90'
Type bits/keyID     Date       User ID
pub  2048R/C65285EC 2015-03-15 trava90 sks-keyservers.net lookup result:

sig  sig3  8FCF9CEC 2015-05-16 __________ __________ Moonchild (RSA signing
key) sig  sig3  6DA5F2AC 2015-11-15 __________ __________ Moonchild (E-mail

My question is:
Can I have a pub key with a unique id C65285EC and a fingerprint, but two
different associated (gpg --export) ascii .asc or binary .gpg files ?

Thanks for your clarifications.
One more thing.
W/r to above display, would it not be better to display the line(s) with
the unverified signature and the missing key in response, so that I could
have a clue which user(s) certified the key and who I was missing on my
ring ?
As you can see from my key server lookups, the pgp.mit.edu was useless in
this regard, only sks-keyservers.net gave me a hint who I was missing.
Like this:
$ gpg --check-sigs C65285EC
gpg: 2 good signatures
gpg: 1 signature not checked due to a missing key
pub   rsa2048/C65285EC 2015-03-15 [SC]
uid         [ unknown] trava90 sig!3        C65285EC 2015-03-15  trava90 sig%3        8FCF9CEC 2015-05-16  Moonchild (RSA signing key)
sub   rsa2048/25192F9F 2015-03-15 [E]
sig!         C65285EC 2015-03-15  trava90 where the missing key line(s) like this would be included:
sig%3        8FCF9CEC 2015-05-16  Moonchild (RSA signing key)
The status could be e.g. "%" char to denote an error as defined in:
      --check-sigs
        ...
Do you think it makes sense to request an enhancement ?

I made it up for the sake of demonstration.
Much appreciated.
