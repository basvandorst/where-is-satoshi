@_subject: Using gpg for french law 
I've succeded to compil and use gpg, it works fine, but now I've a problem
to use it in france. The law in france allow only 128bits key. So my question
is: is it possible to use gpg with 128bits key ? In fact I've already made modifications to use it with 128bits, but I succeded
to create small key and crypt message with it, but I'm unable to decrypt it :-(
So there is a solution or not ?
ps: could you reply directly or cc.
