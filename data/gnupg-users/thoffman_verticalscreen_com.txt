@_subject: using --passphrase-fd 0 option with passphrase containing <> 
This message is in MIME format. Since your mail reader does not understand

Has anyone come across a situation where in a command such as:
prompt> echo 123abc<1>|gpg.exe --passphrase-fd 0 --decrypt file.gpg
Where the < and > in the passphrase cause the command to fail?
When using that command run in a .bat file, I get a "The system cannot find
the file specified." error.
When using that command straight on the command line, I get a "| was
unexpected at this time."
Yet, the exact same command, when used with a passphrase that does not
contain a greater than/less than sign, works fine.
Making the command read the exact same passphrase from a file instead of
stdin, also works fine.
Is there a workaround to this?
