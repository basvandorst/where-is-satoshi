@_subject: [Announce] Updated GnuPG 1.4.0 Windows binary 
When I run gpg, I get the message ...
gpg: error loading 'iconv.dll': The specified module could not be found.
I don't see iconv.dll in gnupg-w32cli-1.4.0a.zip.  So how do I correct
this error?

@_subject: Unsolicited re-subscription 
I had the opposite problem.  I recently joined this mailing list and
stopped receiving messages.  I had to re-subscribe.  I think it is
obvious that the database for current mailing list was overwritten by
an older copy.
