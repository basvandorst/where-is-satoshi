@_subject: import mantra protected secring.gpg 
when i backed up my secure key i only saved the secring.gpg which is
password protected.
now, after system crash, im not able to reuse this secure keyring.
by trying to import it ("--import") or decrypting it i got the failure
"gpg: packet(3) with unknown version 124".
when i try to use it directly as my secring.gpg gpg dont puts out sth.
i havent saved the original configuration file so unfortunately i cant
say sth. about previous configuration and probably used algorithms.
what could it be? maybe a problem of gpg version differences or special
symmetric mantra algorithm? some ideas?
