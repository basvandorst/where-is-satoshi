@_subject: gnupg version 1.2.4 
To Whom it may concern,
We currently have an old version of the GNUPG software version 1.2.4.  We don't do much encrypting.  Only have one vendor that we encrypt the data.  This was done back in 2004.  We have a current vendor that needs to have their file encrypted.  Tried importing their public key into the system, but get an error
Message "Public key not found", when I try to encrypt the data.   I've searched the internet for a resolution, but can't find anything.  We have not updated this software since loading it on the system in 2004!!!  No one here, has a clue of how to get this to work.  Do I just need to get a more updated version of encryption software, or can you give me some direction?????
