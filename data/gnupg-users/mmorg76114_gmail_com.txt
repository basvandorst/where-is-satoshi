@_subject: Problem when decrypting multiple files 
Hey everyone,
I have a bit of a strange error here, hoping someone has run into this
before. I have two different machines with GPG on them, and recently (about
a month ago) they started behaving differently. I used to have a script
which would run ..... --decrypt-files /home/whatever/*.gpg
on both machines which would decrypt all of the files in that directory. For
some reason, about a month ago, one of the machines starting behaving
differently and now this script will only decrypt the first file
(alphabetically) and not do anything to the rest. I really have no idea what
could possibly have spurred this change, but hopefully someone has seen
something like this before or might know what could cause a problem like
this to happen. Thanks in advance
