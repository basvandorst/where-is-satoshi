I know this is probably a stupid question but
I didn't find my answer in GPG Handbook and FAQ.
My question is that if I sign someones user ID
why someone can't take that userID and my sign
from that key and put them in another key?

Can you pint me to some page where I can find
detailed information about GPG like its file formats?
