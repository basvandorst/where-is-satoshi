How do I check if a file is a valid encrypted file before I decrypt it?
Before I decrypt a file, this file does have a .pgp extension, how do I
know if it is a valid encrypted file before I decrypt it?
Looking at the man pages, there is a --verify argument, but that deals
with the sigfile and not an encrypted file.
Basically, I'd like to check the file to make sure it was encrypted
properly before I attempt to decrypt it.
Suggestions, examples or thoughts are greatly appreciated.
