@_subject: Problems with OpenPGP smart card 
I'm trying to use an OpenPGP smart card with gnupg, but I don't get it working. When I try to generate a keypair on the card, the card starts generating it but after a while I get "Key generation failed: general I'm using a ReinerSCT smard card reader which, I think, works fine, because I can access the card and read some data. My system is SuSE 10.0.
Is there anyone who had similar problems and could help me? Thanks very  Karsten
