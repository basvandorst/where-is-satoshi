@_subject: Verifying the gnupg installation 
I am new to gnupg.  I have installed and used gnupg-1.2.1.  Trying to
now verify the installation file but i get the following message:
root>gpg --verify gnupg-1.2.1.tar.gz.sig
gpg: no signed data
gpg: can't hash datafile: file open error
What seems to be the problem?
Thanks in advance,
