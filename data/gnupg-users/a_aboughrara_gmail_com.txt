@_subject: Import a key not successfull 
i'm using GnuPG "gnupg-w32cli-1.4.10b" also i used GPGshell3.75 as a GUI for
the management. and i'm using Windows XP SP2 as an OS.
i need to encrypt a file and send it to another person via email so he sent
me his public key. i tried to import it through the GUI but it gives me this
gpg: key 05932537: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
i tried to import it through different GUI like GnuPG Shell also it couldn't
import the key.
i tried to import it through command line interface, also the same error
message appears, also it gives me another error that gpg: can't convert 'utf-8' to 'CP720'
or some thing like this syntax
the reciever sent me another key but the same error appears again.
any suggestions?
