@_subject: question on a remote machine 
I have installed gpg for users on a mail server.  The trouble is if they ssh to that machine to gen-key they go through the whole process and then it gets to the actual key generation and then they get a message saying "not enough entrophy and 17 more bytes are needed"  I have tried and gotten the same message.  I have tried opening a second telnet window and does some ls's and some cd's.  I have also tried doing a ^Z and backgrounding it with the same errors.
