@_subject: Revoke a key - What is with the decrypted messages? 
Hello all,
I created a key one year ago and used this key. Therefore I have a lot
Now I want revoke this key. That's not the problem, I have a revocation
But what is with the decrypted messages to me, can I still encrypt this

is the secret key invalid too?
Thanks in advance!
