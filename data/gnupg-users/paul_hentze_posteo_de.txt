Hey folks,
I'm kinda stuck here with a problem with pinentry and could use some help.
I described the hole problem in detail here:
For all who don't like links, I will copy it down below.
Patrick Brunschwig already asked some questions and I tried some more
stuff, which is all documented under the link above, but nothing helped.
Has anybody any idea what to do?
Best wishes

Hi folks,
I'm having some problems with GPG right know and hope you can help me.
Debian 9, Thunderbird 52.7.0 (64-bit), Enigmail 2.0.2, GnuPG 2.1.18
I had a harddrive crash recently and had to set up the whole system from
scratch. Because I couldn't do it properly I saved the .gnupg folder und
now copied the whole thing to my new system at the same place. Since
then, I can't use Mailencryption.
I started with the faq page:
Under 'How to analyze' I tried debugging and get
So I fixed that with
from here: Now my secret keys are all gone.
gpg --list-secret-keys gives no output and in enigmail this doesn't work
When I want to put them in enigmail again, the system can't see them.
I tried gpg --gen-key and got even more
I went back to the enigmail Troubleshooting advises above under 'How to
fix it' and tried further, so
1. is good
2. is good, I made this symlink thing, didn't help
3. is good, in my case it's
pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-qt4
4. is good, the gnupg versions are matching
5. I don't need this one, because 4 was good they say
6. here is where I get
ERR 67108949 Kein Pinentry 7. when I type in
killall gpg-agent
 gpg-agent --debug-level expert --use-standard-socket --daemon /bin/sh
I get
option - it has no effect
I tried it without all unnecessary code above:
gpg-agent --debug-level expert /bin/sh
and I get
So this debugging doesn't work somehow and there is no other terminal
window which opens as they say.
Have you got any idea what to do?
I could really use some help. Thanks in advance.

Actually those commands
didn't work.
The terminal responded: "chown: The owner of data XXX is going to be
changed. This is not allowed." and it did that with every file in that
The rest of the commands are finde and I see the secret keys and the
matching keygrips.

Ok, it did work with the chmod command.
Have you got any further ideas?

I did. This works fine as I asses that.
Now I'm still stuck with the pinentry problem.

Okay. I tried your echo and that was fine.
I just copy what I wrote in the emails before, cause this is still the
same problem:
So basically, I can activate pinentry, the echo command Daniel send and
the other one from the enigmail site worked well. All graphical windows
are opening when I force it remotely via terminal, BUT I always get this
strange problem that I can't generate keys and I can't decrypt mails.
I didn't attach the graphical message I always get when I want to open a
encrypted message, cause it's too big for this list.
It says "GnuPG can't ask for your passphrase with Pinentry.
This is a failure of the system installation or a configuration mistake,
this is why enigmail doesn't work.
This problem can't be solved automatically."
This is the problem I am still stuck with.

Hey folks,
Debian 9, Thunderbird 52.7.0 (64-bit), Enigmail 2.0.2, GnuPG 2.1.18
I have a pinentry problem with GPG.
I tried to debug that, but it didn't work out.
I followed the 'How to fix it' advises, from enigmail:
1. is good
2. is good, I made this symlink thing, didn't help
3. is good, I'm using
pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-qt
4. is good, the gnupg versions are matching
5. is good, already in there
6. here is where I get
7. I tried this and get that some of the code is not necessary, so in
short, it is
gpg-agent --debug-level expert /bin/sh
equally I can't use
gpg --gen-key
the return is
I attached the log-data from enigmail, where I reproduced the problem.
Maybe you can find something in there I didn't.
Has somebody any idea what to do?
Best wishes
