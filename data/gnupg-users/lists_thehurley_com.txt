@_subject: w32 client installer - silent install? 
I've downloaded the windows command line client, version 1.4.8, from here: ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32cli-1.4.8.exe
... I'm wondering are there any command line options for the installer?
I'm specifically trying to install gpg silently on multiple computers via a startup script.  I've tried:
"gnupg-w32cli-1.4.8.exe /q"
"gnupg-w32cli-1.4.8.exe /quiet"
"gnupg-w32cli-1.4.8.exe /silent"
"gnupg-w32cli-1.4.8.exe /?"
"gnupg-w32cli-1.4.8.exe --help"
"gnupg-w32cli-1.4.8.exe -h"
... each simply kicks off the visual installer prompting for user input.

Thanks for that.  It looks like gpg4win, version 1.1.3, using gpg 1.4.7; the available version of gpg is 1.4.8 (the updates are listed below).
Should I be worried about not using the latest version of gpg?
What's New [1.4.8]
     * Changed the license to GPLv3.
     * Improved detection of keyrings specified multiple times.
     * Changes to better cope with broken keyservers.
     * Minor bug fixes.
     * The new OpenPGP standard is now complete, and has been published
       as RFC-4880.  The GnuPG --openpgp mode (note this is not the
       default) has been updated to match the new standard.  The
       --rfc2440 option can be used to return to the older RFC-2440
       behavior.  The main differences between the two are
       "--enable-dsa2 --no-rfc2440-text --escape-from-lines
       --require-cross-certification".
     * By default (i.e. --gnupg mode), --require-cross-certification is
       now on.  --rfc2440-text and --force-v3-sigs are now off.
     * Allow encryption using legacy Elgamal sign+encrypt keys if
       option --rfc2440 is used.
     * Fixed the auto creation of the key stub for smartcards.
     * Fixed a rare bug in decryption using the OpenPGP card.
     * Fix RFC-4880 typo in the SHA-224 hash prefix.  Old SHA-224
       signatures will continue to work.

Thank you for this, I've got the scripted install working.  I just have a couple more queries...
I've tried installing using "inst_gnupg2" set to true and then false; it didn't seem to make a difference.  What is the "inst_gnupg2" setting?
Also, what is the "inst_gpgex" setting for?
Many thanks,

Initially, I replied straight back to Werner (by mistake).  He already responded with the answer...
"inst_gnupg2" and "inst_gpgex" are for use in the forthcoming release of
