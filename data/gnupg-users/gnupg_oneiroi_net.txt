Discussion, yes - tough one I think. If you mean by that pushing syscall modification to mainstream - it's not

Are you sure about that? then find a person who will tell you that (you like

Defining from the scratch all the terms and dictionaries before starting

Robert, if you will look around you will find fine and common/universal-enough
definitions of security in context adequate to this thread. If you doubt
about that start a thread for revisiting - for example - wikipedia's terms
regarding IT/information security stuff. I think that most people (and
I'm saying about _most_ of them) will agree that there are fine.

Hello Robert, Hello all.
Well, many expect rise of the quantum computing during lives of most of us.
This can trash most (if not all) asymmetric algorithms (Shor's
algorithm) and reduce strength of symmetric ciphers in half (with for
example Grover's algorithm).
Beside this consider widespread usage of 256-bit symmetric ciphers. If
things you are writing are all the truth behind key length security we
are dealing with huge, mass overkill or even scam perhaps. But I think
we aren't.
Just like modern cellphones' CPU/GPUs are s-f from Apollo mission's
engineers' perspective, just like "640K ought to be enough for anybody"
and like 32-bit address space for IP protocol is more then enough.
History is showing quite clearly that such speculations despite - ofte
high - competencies of the authors are missed.
"Believe" is good term when talking about aesthetics for example. This
isn't the same as being convinced about proper approach to technical
If you have proper background in genetics, fresh stream of information
from covert labs, bio black markets (is there such thing anyway?) its
worth to take your opinion into account.
Please try to avoid comedic undertone of your statements and comparisons
if you want to keep discussion's level sane.
Yeah, then leave your home open because "Wow, who want to check every
door in the world. So many of them".
Yeah, let's drop all the crypto (encryption) for common folk because
And this isn't proof for anything (especially guy is down now). At the
best this can be interesting case study. If someone was never caught
driving without driving license (where this is forbidden)
this doesn't mean that it doesn't make sens to have such license. This
is a common trap - you think it's not worth investing your time and
effort (if any) in some kind of approach/tools/procedures because you
believe there will be no incident in which they'll provided you protection.
Giving users easier-then-hacking-through-sources way of setting bigger
key size isn't a crime.
I think I should give Werner much faster phone now ;) (on my own using
8192-bit RSA key takes about 2-4 seconds to successfully auth; phone was
made in 2010 and is simply _average_ smartphone)

Yes - niche, proof-of-concept, poorly analyzed ciphers. Let's talk about
those widely used and considered mainstream. Those are our biggest concern.
I'm not suggesting that longer key for asymmetric ciphers is a cure for
quantum computing backed cryptanalysis.
I wrote about possible, future way of circumventing need of sucking
nova's energy to successfully attack cipher(text).
Thanks for pointing that but in considered situations this is slight
You can't tell consumer or end-user that he can't use 256-bit, symmetric
cipher for his (even!) porn stash because this is some kind of faux pas
and he is iconoclast because of this. It's up to him. Especially he can
get this for almost same price (We can easily count CPU cycles,
electricity used and so on, but from practical point of view difference
is slight).
Really? Then what's the reason behind 256-bit hw-supproted crypto (e.g.
AES instructions for amd64 and x86), widely accessible on consumer
market which has nothing to do with nuclear weapons?
One more time - this is not up to you or software authors to decide
what's the value behind encrypted data. Even if reason of encrypting it
is silly.
Well, this could be won-won approach for both "camps" because of the
outcome/effects of devs' work.

This is futile. I'm reminding you that you are giving one example of
rarely used algo (so _niche_ and _out_of_mainsteam_) to back your
statement "that there is good amount of them".
This is possibly really big thing to worry. Especially in countries
where pizza is vegetable... But again - you are doing another try to
revalue data which isn't yours with your "value system".
"(...) Thus in the presence of large quantum computers an n-bit key can
provide at least n/2 bits of security."
Slight difference. I don't have more comments.
In context of this discussion your statement is ridiculous. At one point
you even agreed on using 256-bit symmetric cipher for 50+ years
confidentiality (not guaranteed but at least assumed or expected) and
now you are turning all things around.
You are not able to understand that people can get better security
margin dirt-cheap and some stuff can be worth for them of securing for
long, long years. Calling them "not serious" because of picking 256-bit
symmetric cipher is... Well I don't have more comments here.
No. Healthy security margin.
3des is old and it's providing something like 80-112 bits of security.
It has ugly history of keying hacks and some aren't back compatible -
which is ugly. Your "porn stash" (in metaphorical sense. possibly) can
be safe today, but not tomorrow. It's not marketing.

1) You are responding to citation regarding symmetric crypto with widely
used key length.
2) Proponents of approach you are commenting on gave some arguments here
already. If not sure check thread and other sources.
This is open discussion about free software's value and (expected by
some) functionality. Discussion and judging on value of private data is
something totally different you know.
No offence but I don't think that GnuPG is only to address 100% authors'
I'm not forgetting about this. But you are forgetting you are using
symmetric crypto with 256-bit key length (e.g. HTTPS) and you don't have
any problem with this "security overkill" (but yes - symmetric ciphers
are computationally to use cheaper).
For RSA you'll get similar security with ~15k key!
Simply for some 4k isn't enough here. Can you imagine your own, private
data which should be encrypted for more years then 4k asymmetric key is
able to secure? If not you are including into discussion your own needs
(or lack of them) as universal and only truth.
This is your flawed conclusion.
Give people in need reasonable way of providing comparable level of
security in physical means (with at least same costs as with
cryptography). You'll become rich, rich man.

No. Discussion was at some point about reasons of using strong crypto.
And at some point idea that it's not worth to use it against data which
has no value appeared. My point is you are not in the position to say
what's the value of the data someone is encrypting. You weren't reading
carefully enough to see this and you are suggesting me that I'm trying
to force GnuPG authors to do something which is - almost offensive -
rubbish. This is discussion Peter, nothing else.
In overall I agree with this but "disabling all stuff but AES256" is
silly and overdrawn try to devaluate my statement.
If you can't afford this "immense" expense - don't use 8k RSA.
You are following idea that people who are using strong crypto to things
which are in your opinion worthless aren't serious.
Looks like at best you replied to piece of thread without knowing its
There is a difference between your overdrawn (again) interpretation that
all this data is without value in eyes of GnuPG authors. I'm just saying
that it's not for them do evaluate value of this data. Simple as this.

yours. I'm really sorry because of you but this is not my problem.

I mentioned some attributes of ciphers which are generally out of
concern because - e.g. - they aren't widely used. I understand term
"niche cipher" as somehow overlapping and with similar meaning as "out
of mainstream". And I used `,' logical disjunction. Hope my intention is
clear now ;)
after Wikipedia:
"Derivatives of Shor's algorithm are widely conjectured to be effective
against all mainstream public-key algorithms including RSA,
Diffie-Hellman and elliptic curve cryptography". I'm not considering all
of them. I used more general expression.
Thanks for this tip.
And again we are going through field of evaluating data's value. I don't
think I have something more to add here. I understand your point and
possibly person who will ask you such question(s) can follow your advice
without harm.
But I don't think that biggest proponents of longer asymmetric keys are
such kind of guys. Your approach advised to this hypothetical person is
more like tao of using encryption then set of objective rules.
But lacking bigger margin of security because of limited key space. See
NIST advisories for 3des keying methods (see: 50 years+ security
problem; yeah, some people are quite suspicious about them).

You are mixing two topics:

possible impact of QC on asymmetric ciphers in general.
Second topic was started indirectly by you with "tap on nova's energy
output" and my reply to this part has not much too do with first part.
Hmm. Not sure if I can agree with you here. This is something I must
think about.
"(...) This improves the strength of the algorithm when using keying
option 2, and _provides_ _backward_compatibility_ with DES with keying
option 3."
If you aren't OK with this view - fine. Can't help it. The fact is the
simpler and more transparent cipher is, the easier its security
evaluation is. Simplicity in cryptography is often practical.

Obviously it's not. It's for example inappropriate to call single run of
DES 3DES...
And simply, you've just described ugly hack.
And nothing changed in my stance. What's more 3DES is one big hack to
prolong life of outdated cipher.
If you are making such statements as above, try to not do this while
commenting heavily edited, original message.

*The point is to edit a text and have it all encrypted on disk. I'd like

you can fully expect such answers. If you will view editor's scripting
capability as "function to interact with gnupg" this is what you were
asking about.
Perhaps you should check for some "official"/widely accepted standards
describing "secure data modification/handling" without troubling
yourself with defining "safe editor".
Also considering your chase after "safety" and "privacy" think about
focusing on "secure" hardware and OS (could be that your "safe text

Numbers please? Or are you talking about personal/subjective impressions?
Seems to be that one of the main ideas behind modern consumer computing
is to address increasing need of processing capability and storage space
(despite hype surrounding cloud products).
Software is growing and is becoming more complicated, less care and
effort is given to manual craftsmanship in this field, higher level
languages and frameworks are more common. All this comes with a price of
increased processing power requirement and most of the hardware vendors
are doing really good here (really happily).
Also making an imperative from supporting ancient and legacy devices
(and I'm not saying N900 is ancient) is somehow controversial.
On the other hand, one of the conclusions that Mr Schneier presented was
that in case of doubt increasing length of the key is easy and nice
approach. So looks like definition of "overly large" could be somehow

List, Robert.
That's correct but:
1) Specialized microcontrollers with crypto capabilities are available
and used for years now (AVR XMEGA which is 8 bit for example)
2) Stuff you are mentioning in most cases isn't used alone - in case of
need they are used with other chips, this is more or less idea behind
microcontrollers application.
Whatever poetic comparison or description fits here, this is a fact.
Also it's worth to mention that it's not only about consumer computing
hardware: enterprise computing market is overshadowing things are
happening with consumer-grade stuff much.
I don't expect them to be required to do crypto on their own any soon.
SoC thingies are other story but they have power as well as
cryptographic engines quite often (trust to the vendor and/or hw
implementation of the crypto, is other topic).
This is your holy right I think. I would say exactly the same to the
people who are dissatisfied with those settings or hardwired limits.

Well, market for them is tiny, I think this is true. Reason could be
that it's all about cost cutting nowadays and not much vendors views
crypto as necessary feature or good selling point within
customer-oriented market. So it seems to be less about availability of
the technology and more about market trends and people's mindset.
Anyway - perhaps Robert will pick up this topic as he mentioned
microcontrollers first.
Not sure. From my experience FPGAs are used for this purpose quite often
(for example in security accelerator cards and appliances). I have
really limited awareness of software implementations of asymmetric
crypto for microcontrollers and I don't know their quality, standards

Constructive request; from OS perspective I would rather separate user
which is requesting signature verification from keyring owner so I don't
think that --no-sig-cache is only reasonable option in case of "high
security theater" (this makes setup or creation of a proper service more
cumbersome but still - it's possible). Actually it's hard to call setup
in which one user runs MUA or web browser and owns keyring a "high
security theater".

the public-key cryptography we use today involves elliptic curves,
something that is even more ripe for mathematical breakthroughs. It is
not unreasonable to assume that the NSA has some techniques in this area
that we in the academic world do not. Certainly the fact that the NSA is
pushing elliptic-curve cryptography is some indication that it can break
them more easily."**
