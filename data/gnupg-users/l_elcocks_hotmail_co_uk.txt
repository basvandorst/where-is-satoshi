@_subject: FW: Import .p12 key file 
if i import a p12 key file into a trial version of PGP and then export the key back out (including the private key) i can then import the key into GPG. PGP exports the key as a .ASC file.
As a newb, can someone explain what PGP does to the key so that GPG accepts it?
Thanks I use GPG version 1.4.10 is this one of the verrsions that *can* support pkcs12 keys?

Couple of questions if i can about GPG4Win?
I need to import .p12 files, how do i do this via the command line Do i need to make config changes somewhere?
Can i automate GPG2 like i could GPG?
Can i make a config file and load extension IDEA.dll so that it can use IDEA algorithm?
Are the command switches and options the same as GPG but with a 2? (GPG2)
Thankyou

@_subject: GPG 4 Win 
I have finaly managed to import PKSC12 files into GPGSM.  Is their a way of importing OpenPGP keys into GPGSM?
When trying i am just getting error
Error: End of file
The client insists that we use RSA keys using openSSL and bundle into P.12 Files, their public key are come as .txt files, they will ont import into GPGSM, but will import into GPG no problem, so i assume they are open PGP keys, that is indeed what Kleopatra displays.
Any Ideas - before i knock this on the head!?

@_subject: How can I drop a file for encryption on the GPA FileManager 
Good Luck with GPG4win, i cannot find any decent documentation on how to use! and get no reply's from the GPG4Win mailing lists either. You can't sign and encrypt a file at the same time either through the command line so i had to abort and go back to PGP. Really annoyed i waisted my time on this.

@_subject: schedule batch file 
Hello I have installed GNUGP 1.4.10 installed on windows XP. I need to create a script that will allow me to do the following.
Create a 'drop folder' in a directory, where any files dropped in that location will be encrypted and signed with the same keys.
Create a 'decrpted' folder where any encyrpted files that are dropped to this location are decypted using the same keys.
The keys will have passphrases on them, i need to automate this also so their is no human interaction.
I plan to schedule the batch files using XP scheduler
Any help, and i mean any help at all would be greatly appreciated!
Many Thanks

@_subject: encryption automation 
Hello all
I am trying to automate gnupg and im really struggling with the batch file in trying to use, please could somebody help me?
for test purposes i have created a drop folder in the root of C:
i want to be able to drop any type of file in here with any file name, GPG to encrypt the file and place the encrypted version of that file in another location (for test purposes this is C:\encryptedfolder)
this is the command ive placed into a batch cd C:\program files (x86)\gnu\gnupg
gpg --batch --yes --output C:\encryptedfiles\*.gpg -e -u leeelcockstokey -r leeelcocksfromkey C:\outgoingdropfolder\*
What i need the automation to do is the following
for example
I drop the file lee.txt into drop folder, GPG then encrypts it and places into encrypted files folder called lee.txt.gpg
I have the batch running every minute on windows scheduler.
I want to drop any file into the drop folder and GPG to output the encyrpted file with the same name.
The file names will be different everytime.
Any help with this greatly appreciated

PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG;%PATH%

IF EXIST %%F (
ECHO bingos| GPG --batch -se --passphrase-fd 0 -r PGPTOKEY -o "C:\encryptedfiles\%F.pgp"
IF ERRORLEVEL == 0 DEL "%%F"
DEL "%TMP%\~encryptlist.txt"
above is the script im using to try and automate GPG (bingos is not my real password) the above is working sort off
let me explain what i want it to do
a User can drop any type of file, called anything they like into the dropfolder, when the batch runs, i want the file (or files) to be encrypted (all with the same encryption and signing key) and then outputted to the folder called encrypted files, the file names must be the same as they were when they went in, except obviousley the new pgp extension. (i require the output to be a PGP extension)
This is what happens when i run the above batch.
I drop a file called lee.txt (10mb) into dropfolder, run the batch, the file dissapears from drop folder, and appears in the encypted files folder with the file name f.PGP ? and is only 1kb in size ?
the encryptlist.txt appears to be working fine. Im hoping that it will be able to handle more than one file ( I asume that is what the encrypt list is for ?
) however im unable to confirm as the files are becoming over written when they get to encrypted folder. If i drop 2 files at the same time then the encrypted list does pick up 2 different file names.
I can confirm that encyption and signing is working as it should, i can suucesfully decypt and verify signature using PGP, (but like i said, the file is empty)
Hope ive explained clearly enough, thanks to all that have helped me get to this stage. Lee

Hi, I have the signing key as the default key in the config file, do i still have to use both in the command, the encyption and signing is working perfectly, just the output of the file name (and size) that i cannot get to work.
Im really sorry, ell explain what i need the script to be able to do
User can drop any files into drop folder for example lee.txt and the out put of the file will be lee.txt.pgp
also if their was more than one file in their, lee.txt and test.xls the out put would be lee.txt.pgp and test.xls.pgp
So with that , will the below script work?

Hello all.
This is my last resort. I know that this is not the realy the correct place to pose such a question.
I have now succesfully set up a fully automated GPG solution, with the help of all of you on this list.
However my next task is to intergrate the scripts with GPG with WINSCP.
basically i want to do this.
Auto encrypted files end up in a folder called C:\encryptedfiles
then the WINSCP script will run and look at the files in the above folder, collect the file names into a temporary text file, and SFTP them over to a remote server.
My question is does anybody on this list have any knowledge of WINSCP scripting?
Ive had a look at the help pages on the website and cannot for the life of me figure them out! PS
I'm willing to pay!

this is the script i intend to use

IF EXIST %%F (
MY PUTTY COMMAND GOES HERE ????????????????????????????????????????
IF ERRORLEVEL == 0 DEL "%%F"
DEL "%TMP%\~encryptlist.txt"
I suppose what im asking is, please could you give the command, by the way does putty support SFTP with TLS authentication?

i dont know of this command --gpg-args, and by the looks of it, neither does GPG (that's what the errors telling you)
echo passphrase| gpg-zip --gpg-args --passphrase-fd -o test.gpg -s
The line should be echo passphrase| gpg-zip --gpg-args --passphrase-fd 0
I also dont know of gpg-zip, and neither does GPG, thats what the error is telling you.

Your out put should look like this.
"C:\encryptedfiles\%%F.pgp" %%F
What does it output? Also, sure you want to echo in the password? Seems
like it's not necessary.
