I'm making use of libgcrypt for a specific encryption application.  I'm
assuming that the following is secure:
- Use libgcrypt to create a keypair
- Save the S-exp to an internal, protected keystore
- Base64 encode the public-key portion of the S-exp
- Broadcast the base64-encoded key to associated clients
- Use the broadcasted public-key to encrypt data
- Send encrypted data back to a server containing the keystore
- Only server can decrypt encrypted data using private keys
Can someone please correct me if I am wrong?  Is there a problem with this
approach, or perhaps a better one?

Thanks for the reply...
I think I'm missing something, then...  Does that mean the operations
provided by libgcrypt are not secure to use by themselves? -----Original Message-----

Without a detailed specification of the protocol it is almost impossible,
but for starters, do not encrypt actual non-random data with a pubkey.
It is always bad idea to roll your own crypto protocol, use SSL/TLS or
OpenPGP or CMS, or XML cryptography if possible.

Thanks for the reply (and keeping me from making a big mistake)...
So, for doing basic data encryption / transmission, what's the right way to
go?  We just need to do public key encryption, send the data (via email or
postal), decrypt on a backend.
Thanks for all the help here...  Obviously I'm trying to forge new ground
for our company.

Thanks for all the help!  We are going to look into OpenPGP and OpenSSL
(since we may need it for our web server anyway).

It sounds like straight OpenPGP will do the job for you.  It is a
well-understood and widely supported protocol for public key
encryption.  GnuPG can do what you need right out of the box, and can
handle both email and postal easily.

I've been searching the lists and Google, but have not found the answer to
my question... I apologize if it is well-known.  I have a simple little app
that wraps the libgcrypt functions to provide a keygen, encrypt, & decrypt
functionallity.  I'm able to save my keys and use files with base64-encoded
S-expressions and things seem to be working well...  Now, on to my question:
What I'd like to do is save the key as a base64-encoded version of the bits.
The trouble I'm having is that I can't seem to figure out how to extract the
raw bits of the key from the gcry_sexp_t.  I can use the dump & print funcs
to see the MPI values, but I just can't seem to get at what I'm going for
Is it reasonable to simply base64-encode the entire S-expression and use
that for key exchange?
Any help here would be greatly appreciated...  Although I'm familiar with
the key creation & encryption algorithms, I'm a bit of a newbie to public &
private key representations.
