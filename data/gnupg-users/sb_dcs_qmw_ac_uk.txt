@_subject: expired key: renewal via pgp 
Hi,
 I am using GNUpg, and I have just modified the expiration
 date of my old key via this command:
 gpg --edit-key sb expire
 The key results ok, locally, but the server still labels it as
 "expired". I re-sent the key, but the date did not change.
 The gory point is that, in principle, it is a waste to leave
 an old key in the sever(s). It must be possible to update the old
 one, but id does not seem to be working. Any clue?
 Please either subscribe me or Cc to me, as I am not subscribed to
 this list and there are no informations on how to do it.
