@_subject: Decrypt issue: Please enter name of data file ? 
I am trying to decrypt an encrypted file with following statement.
gpg -o "D:\test\out\Test.xml" --passphrase-fd 2 2<"D:\test\passtest.txt" --decrypt "D:\VZ\test\Test.xml"
It works fine for most of the files. Yesterday onwards I am getting an issue with some of the files.
The message is
Detached signature.
Please enter name of data file:
And it expects the file name as a user input.
Why is it happening and what is the solution.
