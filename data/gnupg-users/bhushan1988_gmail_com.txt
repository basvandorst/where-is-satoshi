@_subject: Securely delete files... 
Hi all,
I wanted to know how could the file be deleted securely using PGP?

@_subject: File Extensions supported by GnuPG..... 
I am using Bouncy Castle Libraries(a JAVA library for PGP
encryption(rfc2440)) for encrypting the files.
If I use any other extension than .gpg for the output encrypted file and try
to decrypt the file using command-line GnuPG the following error message is
Unknown Suffix.
Now if I change just the extension of the same encrypted file to .gpg and
then try to decrypt using GnuPG, it works fine.
Also, due to similar experiences what I have understood is that GnuPG
supports following extensions for following cases:---
Encryption----->  .gpg

I just want to know if there is some standard used by GnuPG  in terms of
extensions so that if I create an encrypted file or only signed file or
signed and encrypted file using my own program, then the respective files
would be compatible to GnuPG.
Please suggest me the extensions I should use for the following file
  1. Encrypt only
  2. Sign only
  3. Encrypt and sign
Also if I create my own extensions say 3 different extensions for the above
3 type of files then will the encrypted files be compatible with GnuPG?
If not which are the extensions the GnuPG would be compatible with?

Thanks for the reply. It was really a lot informative and well
explained. But I am sorry that it still doesn't solve the problem.
I am attaching with this mail an original file, a file encrypted and
signed having an extension .gpgasc,a zip folder containing my
keys(both secret and public)(it contains a single key for a single
user) and the password for the secret key is "bhushan".
The error for the command gpg --decrypt-files license.txt.gpgasc  is :------
gpg: license.txt.gpgasc: unknown suffix
You can check it if you wish to..........
And then as soon as I change the extension from .gpgasc to .gpg
The file gets decrypted correctly and the signature is verified.
I am not understanding why?
Please help me!

@_subject: Incompatibility between GnuPG encryption and the Bouncy Castle 
I have created RSA key as well as its subkey for encryption using GnuPG. Now
I encrypted a file using JAVA library functions given by Bouncy Castle (a
pgp library in JAVA which claims to adhere to rfc 2440). I also encrypted
the same file using the GnuPG commands from command line. The following are
the results of the pgpdump for both of them...........

@_subject: OpenPGP offering - easy way to secure files for storage. 
Here is a technology titled "Policy-Driven File Encryption Explorer Based on
OpenPGP for Secure Storage Solutions"
release recently on IBM alphaWorks , dowloadable for anyone and everyone.
All it requires is a simple user register.
It makes use of bouncycastel and SWT libraries and is very user friendly and
consumable. Worth a try to easily secure your files over desktops/laptops or
filebased storage. One of the most effctive way to use bouncycastel open
PS : Read the Readme file first to have a kick and quick start to it.

@_subject: OpenPGP digital signature query 
Thanks all for your wise advice. I am basically an engineering student and I
wanted the information for my studies. Affording a lawyer for it is beyond
my pocket :-), but I highly appreciate your valued advice. Most of the
references I read kind of state PKI based digital signatures , but since
OpenPGP is so popular, i was wondering if even that can be deployed.
