@_subject: Howto multiple mail accts. 
I'm new to gpg and have some doubts I could not google. Please direct
me to a FAQ /  HOWTO / etc if such document exists:
I have several mail accounts, some personal, some for work, etc.  I
have seen three possibilities to deal with this:
- Add multiple UIDs to my main key
- Have multiple signing subkeys
- Have secondary "complete" keys signed by my main key.
I've been reading the pros/cons of each aproach and can't make up my
mind to what is the best approach.
Right now I thinnk the best would be to have a main key, with no
e-mail at all and use this to sign other keys, one for each mail
What do you think?
Thanks for answers,

Yes, I was considering this approach for my work accounts. With those
it can even be good to publicize the other accounts. The question is
what happens when you change project / client / etc and are given a
new mail address? Do you need everybody to resign your key or does it
suffice to add / delete UIDs?
Yes, that's why I wanted to have a master and several other keys. Even
if it would be easy for the knowledgeable to find out all addresses I
have, it would not be evident for the casual spammer.
Similar to my situation.
Yes, I had already seen this. To my novice eyes it seems to much of
twiddling. Maybe when I have some more experience I'll give it another
Thanks for your comments.
