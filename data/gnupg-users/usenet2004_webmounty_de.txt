@_subject: locally signed keys are not necessarily fully trusted any more 
after I switched from gnupg-1.2.6 to gnupg-1.4.0 I noticed a peculiar
problem concerning the validity of some of the keys in my keyring -
although I signed all of them locally some are not regarded "fully"
trusted any more.

other keys I signed locally are just fine and no - those are not signed by a trusted third party either.
I can repair the problem if I remove my local signature from those keys and use "lsign" again. Am I making a stupid mistake here?
