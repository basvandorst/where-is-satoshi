Hi Team,
We need to install the GPG software in our AIX & LINUX machines, however first we need to install GPG on AIX servers and need your support in order to install the software. Kindly share us the link & document to download the relevant software and to install the software and procedure to configure it? Along with rollback process in case of issues. Awaiting reply.
