Up again, isn't it?
The buglist
links to 404.
maybe OT, because the content is not hosted at gnupg.org, but linked.

@_subject: error while decrypting message: trustdb.gpg 
Hi there.
I decided to create a CD-Rom with my personal keys and the GPG software   to be able to work with GPG during my travels without installing anything on foreign hosts.
The CD contains:
GnuPG v1.0.6 (MingW32)
Whenever I try to decrypt or encrypt a message, gpg stops with an error:
-----> snip
gpg: fatal: g:/keys/trustdb.gpg: can't open: Permission denied
secmem usage: 2176/3296 bytes in 5/8 blocks of pool 3904/16384
<----- snap
while g: is the CD-Rom.
Any suggestions?
System: GnuPG v.1.0.6 on Win2k
Kind regards,

@_subject: Compiling GnuPG for Windows with MingW32 
Hi there.
Maybe this question belongs to the developer-list, but it asks more about compiling than writing code (yes, both is part of "developing") and could be interesting for many users, too.
Enhancing my security, I'm trying to compile my own GnuPG binaries. On Linux, this wasn't a problem and worked quit fine (with 1.0.7).
The next step is to compile binaries for Windows (98 and 2000), but I don't have any experience in working with Windows-compiler.
Somewhere in the list-archive, I found the information, that MingW32 is a cross-compiler, which can build GnuPG on Linux and export Windows Are there any documentations or special hints about how to build GnuPG on Linux and port it to Windows with MingW32?
Kind regards,
