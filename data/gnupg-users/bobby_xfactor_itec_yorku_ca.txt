@_subject: Using gpg on multiple systems 
Hello, I am not subscribed, so please CC me when you reply.
I'm planning on using gpg at home and at work. At home gpg is installed on
my computer where I'm the only one who uses, so my keys are secure enough.
At work however, a lot of people use the machines and they have gpg
installed. I'm paranoid about leaving my keys at the work server though.
What's the safest way for me to use the same keyID and keys at both work
and home? Both systems are running Linux.
Do I have to create two separate IDs for them? I'm new at this, so I'd
appreciate the step by step procedure on how to do it.
Thanks in advance.

@_subject: using gpg securely on a remote system 
Hi all,
I want to be able to sign/encrypt emails that I send on a remote system
that I log into. I do not have physical access to this machine, nor do I
have administrative rights. It is just a machine that I log into everyday
remotely and do work on. What is the most secure way of keeping my keys
safe on that system? I would rather not create a new key just for this.
I understand that one way to do this is to have a copy of the gpg
executable and my keys on a CD/floppy and copy the received email into a
text editor on a local machine, add the reply, encrypt/sign it, and then
paste it back into the ssh client and send off the email. This is rather
cumbersome and I'm looking for a much more efficient way of doing this if

Thank you.

I've created a signing subkey as you suggested and exported it, but now
I'm stuck at how to import it at work. Do I have to edit anything in my
key or copy my entire .gnupg directory there? Wouldn't I still need my
private key in order to sign emails?
Thanks for your patience.

@_subject: sending and receiving keys 
Hi again,
Whenever I try to send or receive a key from search.keyserver.net I get an
gpg --keyserver search.keyserver.net --recv-key 0x12345678
gpg: requesting key 12345678 from search.keyserver.net ...
gpg: [fd 5]: read error: Connection reset by peer
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
However when I try to receive from pgpkeys.mit.edu it works fine:
gpg --keyserver pgpkeys.mit.edu --recv-key 0x12345678
gpg: requesting key 12345678 from pgpkeys.mit.edu ...
gpg: key 12345678: public key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
What am I doing wrong here?
PS: Plese CC me.
Thank you.
