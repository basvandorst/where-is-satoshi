@_subject: Keyserver doesn't honour signature removal 
== I think my last post went wild because the subscription process
wasn't completed yet ...
Hi list,
due to dome issues, I have pretty many signatures on my key that I don't
want (or need) anymore. I can remove them locally, but when sending the
key to the keyserver afterwards, the changes are just ignored.
Is it even possible to remove signatures from a key and distribute this
change? Or am I doing something wrong?

Hi John,
that is, I can add anything I want to my key, but never remove it? Not
even signatures?
I understand that I cannot remove keys, but I think any changes that
require my secret key would be ok :( ...

@_subject: Updating a signature 
Hi folks,
I would like to updatea signature on a key, that is, add a sig-policy-url
and change the verification level (turn a normal sig into a sig3, that is).
Is this possible? If yes, how?
Please CC me when replying as I am not (yet) subscribed to the list :).
Thank you!

@_subject: Moving from RSA to Ed25519 
I was thinking about moving from rsa4096 to ed25519.
I really do not want to lose all the signatures on my key.
What I could do is add the ed25519 signature and encryption keys to my existing rsa key as subkeys, but I guess this will not improve security because my RSA signature key could still be used.
From my understanding it is not possible to expire the primary key and keep Did I get something wrong? If not, what is the smoothest thing to do to
