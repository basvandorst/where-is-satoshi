Hopefully someone can assist with an issue that has been bugging me.  We are
currently running (GnuPG) 1.4.7 on a Windows server. We sent over our public
key to a vendor who is encrypting a file with our public key and signing it
with their public key.  The vendor is using PGP.
When trying to decrypt the file, I receive the following error:
C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG\gpg" --yes --passphrase-fd 0 < passphrase.txt -o
test-output.txt -d EncryptionTestFile.txt.pgp
Reading passphrase from file descriptor 0
gpg: mpi too large for this implementation (34055 bits)
Any ideas what we can check to troubleshoot this error?
Is this due to a problem on our end or the vendor's end?
Thanks for any help anyone can provide!

You were absolutely right!
I setup the ftp download again but this time using binary mode.  The
decryption process is now working.
