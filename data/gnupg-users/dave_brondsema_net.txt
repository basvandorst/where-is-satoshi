@_subject: PGP messages getting flagged as spam 
I have started an OpenPGP plugin for SpamAssassin that could be useful to
assign a negative score to signed emails.  See
  I am
using it myself, but it is not complete and I wouldn't recommend using it in
production environment without some good testing.  And patches for it,
probably :)
