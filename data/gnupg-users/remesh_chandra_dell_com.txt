@_subject: Encryption with key ID 
We received a public key from one of our vendors, which does not have an email reference. We have imported it to our key ring and it looks like this.
pub  1024D/5XXXXX11 2005-08-08 ABC DEF GHI
sub  6000g/99999993 2011-01-01
We are used to encrypting by providing the email account reference in the -recipient option. Since this one just has a phrase (ABC DEF GHI), we are unable to do so. The vendor's suggestion is to use their key id (0x5XXXXX11) to do the encryption. Is this possible? If yes, what is the command to do so?
Thanks in Advance

I tried all those options; it generates the below error.
gpg: fatal: too many random bits requested; the limit is 4799
secmem usage: 3008/3008 bytes in 5/5 blocks of pool 3200/16384
Any clues?

even better, if you prefix the keyID with 0x gpg will automatically interpret it as such.
Read the "HOW TO SPECIFY A USER ID" section in the gpg manpage for more details.

What operating system are you using?  What version of gpg?
It looks to me like "the limit is ..." was removed over 10 years ago -- are you using an up-to-date version of gpg?
