@_subject: Revocation certificate still valid after changing subkeys? 
When I created my keypair I dutifully created and safely stored a
revocation certificate for it.
I recently added a new subkey and revoked the old subkey (as discussed
on this list).  I've also added and revoked a few UIDs since the key
was created.
Is there any reason to generate a new revocation certificate? Or does
it apply directly to the master key only?

@_subject: unable to execute program `gpgkeys_hkp': Permission denied 
I compiled and installed GnuPG 1.4.0.  Everything works except interaction with keyservers.  When I use --send-key, --recv-key or --refresh, it always fails thus:
$ gpg -v --recv-key F09BDAD5
gpg: requesting key F09BDAD5 from hkp server pgp.mit.edu
gpg: unable to execute program `gpgkeys_hkp': Permission denied
gpg: keyserver internal error
gpg: keyserver receive failed: keyserver error
How do I fix this?

@_subject: Are all the UIDs on a key supposed to be equal? 
Erwan David:
I added a UID, revoked another UID, and changed the primary UID, then the key to the MIT keyserver.  The keyserver's verbose listing includes the new UID but doesn't indicate the revocation.  Is that normal?

Hmm.  I found all those files in /usr/local/libexec/gnupg/ on my system, but identified a related problem: the /usr/local/libexec and /usr/local/libexec/gnupg directories were not world-executable. "chmod a+x /usr/local/libexec /usr/local/libexec/gnupg" fixed it.  Thanks for pointing me in the right direction.
Is this a bug in the install?

I did the "./configure" and "make" with 0077, then "su", then "make install" with 0022.

@_subject: Are all the UIDs on a key supposed to be equal? 
Are all the user-ids (combinations of name, e-mail address and comment) equal, or can one be the "primary" one?
I started to generate a new key because the old has several obsolete e-mail addresses in the UIDs.  I gave my "main" e-mail address and comment in response to the "gpg --gen-key" prompts, then used "gpg --edit-key" to add UIDs.  When I then listed the key, they were out of order.  I had been under the impression (maybe it was just coincidence with my previous key) that the first UID is the main one.

@_subject: Relying on gpg exit code 0? 
Should I be confident about using gpg's return code 0 in a script (run automatically by at or cron) to make encrypted backups?  Example:
cd /backup/directory
tar cf user1.tar /home/user1
gpg -er 0x01234567 user1.tar && rm user1.tar

@_subject: Best/correct way to back up keys and configuration? 
What's the best way to back up my GnuPG keyrings -- just a tar.gz of the ~/.gnupg directory?
Or is there any advantage to producing additional files with the "--export" and "--export-secret-keys" commands?
(I know that the backups then need to be stored securely.)

@_subject: How to import a secret subkey? 
I recently created a new subkey for a keypair that I use on two machines, but I cannot get the subkey onto the second machine.  I have tried gpg --export, --export-secret and --export-secret-subkey on the first computer but gpg --import refuses to add the subkey on the second How can I do this?

That worked.  Thanks!
I think there used to be a restriction that "gpg --import secretkey.gpg" wouldn't work without setting a special option.  Is importing secret keys by accident no longer considered a risk?

@_subject: How to extend subkey's expiry date? 
My key expired recently and GPG would (of course) not let me encrypt
to it.  I'd like to keep using the same key.  So I used "gpg
--edit-key" and the "expire" subcommand to extend the expiry date.
Unfortunately the only subkey's expiry date did not change, so I still
can't encrypt to the key.
$ gpg --edit-key e3c5ee5e
pub  1024D/E3C5EE5E  created: 2002-02-19  expires: 2007-03-07  usage: CS                       trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate
sub  2048g/66796190  created: 2002-02-19  expired: 2005-02-18  usage: E   I've tried using "expire sub" and "expire 66796190" commands inside
edit-key, but I can't change the expiry of the subkey.
Is it possible to do so, or do I need to add a new subkey to keep
using the same main key?

@_subject: How to extend subkey's expiry date? 
Is it worthwhile to replace and revoke subkeys periodically, or should I just renew the expiry date?

@_subject: Shouldn't keyservers store and provide subkeys? 
Following a recent discussion about subkeys, I decided to add a new
subkey and revoke the old one on each of my keys (one used at work,
one at home).  Then I tried to update each machine to have the new
public subkeys (using pgp.mit.edu):
work $ gpg --send-key WORKKEYID
home $ gpg --recv-key WORKKEYID
home $ gpg --send-key HOMEKEYID
work $ gpg --recv-key HOMEKEYID
In both cases, the output of "gpg -v --list-key KEYID" showed that the
new subkey had not been added.  I had to use --export and --import to
get the subkeys transferred in both directions.
Is this normal behaviour or did I do something wrong?

Thanks very much for the information.  I was not aware of this problem.
