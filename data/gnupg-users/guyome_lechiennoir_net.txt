@_subject: x509 and openGPG smartcard 
I've just bought a Gemalto USB Shell Token V2 and openGPG smartcard. I
successfully get it work on Ubuntu 12.04 (gnupgp 2.0.17) without any problem. However, I
can't store a x509 certificate on the smartcard.
I get a certificate from Cacert that I converted with gpgsm
gpgsm --import guyome.p12
gpgsm -o guyome.pem --export -a XXXXXX
Then I edit the smartcard gpg2 --card-edit
and I import the certificate on the smartcard
gpg/card> admin
Les commandes d'administration sont permises
gpg/card> writecert 3 < guyome.pem
Up to now, I did not get any error message. But If do
gpg/card> readcert 3 > test.pem
gpg: error reading certificate from card: Not Found
gpg/card> writecert 3 < guyome.pem
gpg: error writing certificate to card: General Erreur
It seems that I can't write the certificate to the smartcard.
Is it a bug or did I made a mistake? BTW, I get the same error on Fedora 16..

It seems that the version of gnome shipped with F17 includes a
gnome-keyring that supports smartcard (cf
 You should look into seahorse/key
manager if your smartcard is listed in it

I've just tested Fedora 17 on a Liveusb with gpg. So first, gpg2 nor gpg
was able to detech my Gemalto USB Shell Token. Then, I install pcsc-lite
and run the pscd daemon. In this case, gpg --card-status --disable-ccid
works but not gpg2.
gpg2 --card-status gpg: can't connect to the agent - trying fall back
gpg: OpenPGP card not available: No SmartCard daemon
So it seems that the ccid driver that are included into gpg has a
problem. It will try to send some more log later. I hope that the pcscd
work-around could help
