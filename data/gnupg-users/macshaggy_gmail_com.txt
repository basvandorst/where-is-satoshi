@_subject: Public Key not found. 
Hash: SHA256
Hey Everyone:
I keep getting this from gpg:
gpg: public key of ultimately trusted key {key id 1} not found
gpg: public key of ultimately trusted key {key id 2} not found
Possibly, while learning to use gpg I created two keys that I have  ultimate trust with but I'm not sure. How can I remove them from my  trustdb since I don't really know how they ended up there?
Any help would be appreciated.
Thank you,
