I apologize for my bad english ,but i am not a native speaker .
First ,you need a telnet and an ssh client .Telnet should not be a problem
,because it is part of the Windows and Linux installation .Just open a
terminal windows and type telnet  .This will do it under Linux
and Windows .If the server allows telnet ,you will be prompted for your
username and password .If not ,the connection will be refused .But I
disencourage the use of telnet ,because passwords are send in cleartext .
That brings us to ssh .SSH is a part of the Linux installation ,so you
should have it installed under Linux .Type ssh  .With Windows
,you have to download a SSH Client .You can find one on .Because SSH encrypts the data send on the connection ,it is always better
to use ssh than telnet .Hope I could help you .
