@_subject: email client 
I recently installed GPG and am contemplating how to get the most
from it.  My current email client is Netscape Mail.  I know of no
easy way to integrate GPG into this client.  For this reason, I
would like to ask for suggestions on a new email client.
What I want from my client is basically this:
When sending mail, an internal list of email addresses is checked.
If this email address is marked as belonging to someone on your
keyring, encrypt the message using the recipient's public key.
When receiving mail, encrypted messages are automatically decrypted
using your GPG keyring.
Simple, eh?
Basically I want to use encrypted communication wherever possible.

@_subject: IDEA (was: Re: Decryption problem) 
I don't think that algorithms are patentable under US Patent law either.  However, the
US Patent office is broken, and has been broken for some years.  The US Patent office
has been regularly giving out patents on unpatentable items such as algorithms
and 'Save As' dialogs. :)
To be patentable, an invention must be one of the 4 following:
a process, a machine, a manufacture, or a composition of matter.
The algorithm is undoubtably being placed in the category of 'process'.
This is an incorrect interpretation of the 'process' as described in
US Code Title 35.  (process is definied in Part II, Chapter 10, Section 100).
Until the patent code is revised to take into account these relatively recent
advances in technology, we will continue to see bogus patents being awarded.
Normally, you would hope that any 'patent-infringement' of such patents will
fall down in court if you ever get in trouble with the patent holder.  Does anyone
know of any legal cases in which the judge ruled in favor of the holder of
the questionable patent?
Intresting is that European law states that computer algorithms are equivelant
The American Republic will endure, until politicians realize they can
bribe the people with their own money.
