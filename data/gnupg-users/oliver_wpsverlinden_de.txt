Hey guys,
some days passed and I used the chance to implement further functionalities for the cryptolist software.
Some minutes ago I uploaded the source code at GitHub. So you are invited to participate in this project and help in further developement and testing. ;)
You can find the repository here: Best regards

Hey guys,
some days ago I had the idea of a pgp compatible mailing list.
I know there is a mailman extension which supports pgp encrypted messages out there, but I wanted ta have a small, fast and easy to configure solution.
I imagined something like that:
- A list member writes an pgp signed and encrypted message to the list server
- Encryption is enforced: Non encrypted messages are rejected
- The senders pgp signature is checked, to ensure the message integrity
- The message is multiplied and resigned/reencrypted by the list server
- The signed and encrypted messages are delivered to the list members
Well it's weekend, so I started to code. ;)
Meanwhile the key functionalities are implemented and the project is ready for some beta tests. It's very annoying to write emails to myself all the time to check functionality. So if you want to try this, just give me a short notification with your public key id. I will add your public key into the lists keyring and add you to the recipients list.
After some testings, the whole project will be available on SourceForge.
Best regards

Hi kwadronaut,
No, I did not know Schleuder yet. Thank you for the link, I will take a look at this.
That's right. This functionality is the basic functionality of a mailing list software (combined with secure cryptography).
Depending on the peoples feedback I will imlement additional (useful) I will see.....
As I mentioned above. I will take a deeper look at Schleuder.
By the way. Is it open source too?
Oh really? I did not heard about that. The projects I downloaded from SourceForge were "clean".
No, your tone is absolutely fine. I just spend some great programming hours on this project and got some experiences with encrypt things programmatically.
You're right, if I have a great idea and too much free time, I just try to implement this and follow this target very enthisiastic.
That's me. ;)
Best regards

Ok, let me answer them. ;)
The key is picked by one or more given email addresses. The recipient email address drives the key selection.
Expired keys are not better then non available keys. Encryption will fail and the list admin is notified.
... need to be added to the list manually. I don't want to add encryption keys automatically. The list admin should check the level of trust, so this is used to be a manual task. I asume that the list of subscribers is mainly fixed and changes are a rare event.
See above. In productive environments the list admin is hosting my software and of course may decide who to give access to the list. In this list I am searching for beta testers so everyone who is interested will get access.
No archive functionality at the moment.
At the moment delivery failures are not handled. So if the outbound mail server does not accept the message, it will be skipped.
In the future some errors should have a retry count and be processed again after some time.
You only encrypt with the list's public key. As the list subscribers are added manually by you (as the admin), you should only give trustful people access to the list.
The list itself does not leak any confidental information. Of course if you have a untrusted member in the list he will receive the confidental shared information (in a encrypted way, but he is able to unencrypt and read them)
challenging in its own right
What do you mean with store-and-forward handling. Can you explain?
Best regards

That's the way asymmetric encryption works.
You encrypt the plain message with someones public key, but onle the owner of the connected private key (hopefully only the receiver) can decrypt the So if you encrypt a outgoing message with the public key of the recipient but not with your orn public key, you will not be able read the messages you sent.
To solve this issue most email programs additionally encrypt outgoing messages with you own public key before the message is saved in the "Sent" folder. If you have done this, you can easily decrypt the message with your own private key and you can read these messages afterwards
