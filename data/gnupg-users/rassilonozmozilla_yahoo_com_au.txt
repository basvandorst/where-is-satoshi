Hi Patrick
Shows up as good to me...
UNTRUSTED Good signature from Patrick Dickey (Pats Computer Solutions)
Key ID: 0x01D97BB0 / Signed on: 10/08/2005 6:35
Key fingerprint: D485 4A6A F3C1 38BA 798F 4E38 9581 C7CB 01D9 7BB
I have a similar problem. I can get two emails from you signed with the
same key and one will be a good signature and the other won't for no
apparent reason to the same account!
Don't jump too soon as you may have to do all this over again, as for
your question at hand, I would revoke it if you have sent it to a key
server as otherwise people will not know that you are no longer using
that key (Of have I missed the point of key revocation - anyone?)
