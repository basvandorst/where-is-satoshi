@_subject: ultimate trust 
Happy new year all.
I know that this has been discussed a little before,
but I think it is worth looking at again.
PGP / GPG as always been cursed by the word "trust",
because there are two ways in which gpg needs to trust
a key: firstly to be the key it claims to be (ie
validity), and secondly as an introducer of other
keys.  For the most part, these two are clearly
separated but I wonder if the "trust" menu of the
--edit-key option in more recent versions of gpg needs
a rethink.
A user is offered the chance to set how much he or she
"trusts" a key.  There is no clue to the user that
options 1-4 relate to trusting a key to introduce
others, whereas option 5 (ultimate trust) will mean
that gpg trusts the key in the
is-trusted-to-be-what-it-claims sense.
That is, setting 1-4 have no effect on whether or not,
say, a given signature made by the key is trusted:
even a "fully trusted" key is considered "invalid"
without trusted introducers, while a key marked as not
trusted may be considered perfectly valid.  On the
other hand, setting ultimate trust suddenly makes a
huge difference.
I understand the reasons why setting "ultimate trust"
may be a good thing in some settings, but perhaps I
could suggest it is moved to a seseparate option -
"mark-ultimate-trust" perhaps? - and even made an
"expert" option only.
At the very least, in my view, there ought to be a
clear help text to note that options 1-4 are about
trusting introducers, and option 5 is about something
Not sure if this is really a devel or user issue, so
apologies for the x-post.

Dear David,
Without wishing to question any of the defaults, which
I think make perfect sense, could I just point out
that the man page does not make it clear that level 0
signatures are ALWAYS accepted, regardless of the
min-cert-level?  As I read it at the moment, it seems
to suggest that by default level 0 and level 1
signatures are both ignored, which I'm sure is not the

I've just compiled gnupg-1.4.1 on Mac OS X, and
noticed that it does not give the warning I'm used to
on Linux about secure memory.  Is that normal? There
is a configure option to --enable-m-guard, but I can't
find any documentation about it.  Send instant messages to your online friends

@_subject: Expiring UID 
Am I right that there is no easy way to create an
expiring UID (as opposed to an expiring key).
--ask-cert-expire seems to be ignored when using
adduid in the edit menu.
Is there a good reason for this?    Best, N.

@_subject: Expiring UID 
It's not that I see a desperate need for the feature,
it just seemed an interesting omission, and I wondered
what the reason was.
I'm surprised that compatibility is a problem - I
assumed it would be done by having the self-signature
on a UIUIDe created with an expiration date, which
surely all OpOpenPGPrograms would notice.
The situation I thought it would be useful for is if a
UIUIDs associated with a job/position that will only
last a fixed period of time - especially if access to
the account might change after that point.
Including it would probably require numerous changes,
such as asking a 3rd-party signer if a signature
should expire at the same time as the self-sisig..
As I say, probably little/no need.  Just an
interesting quirk.

@_subject: Bogus Key on Keyservers 
The problem is, that IF the email infrastructure was
secure enough to be trusted, there would be no need
for pgp/gpg/smime at all.  An email verification step
is not, and cannot be, 100% secure.  Of course, in many cases, email is not re-routed,
server admins can be trusted, email systems are not
broken in to - to the extent that email without
additional security is largely trusted as "good
But, in fact, if someone is willing to forge a key
with your name on, it is probably one of those times
that email may well not be "good enough".  Hence the
need to rely on key fingerprints, not on the email

@_subject: PKCS#11 support for gpg-agent 
I don't mean to get involved in the heated discussion
about smart cards and the like, but since it has been
raised, I would welcome some clarification about
gpg-1.9, and the thinking behind adding support for
s/mime.  What is the "roadmap" (from the point of view
of users) for gpg?
Is there any sense in which opengpg is, or may be
soon, a deprecated standard? Beyond the pros and cons of centralised CAs, what are
the advantages of the two?
It seems to be the case that amongst individuals and
open source projects, openpgp is in very wide use
(these things are relative!) - and given the ease with
which openpgp has shown it can adapt to emerging
security threats I would expect that to continue.  I
have no idea at all how well commercial pgp is doing.

Actually, there is this, which might do what you need.
But I've never tried it.  Worth a go, perhaps.

@_subject: RFCs, standards, 
Thank you for your email.  It made me reflect.  I had
been ignoring this discussion.  HTML emails are here
to stay, and may users of the internet rely on them. Indeed, text only emails can look horrid on many
Outlook setups, a fact I was long unaware of since I
haven't used it in about 7 years.
It's hard enough getting people to use encrypted email
as it is - telling them they can't use what is to many
people a very standard tool doesn't seem to me a good
way forward.
It seemed to me that PGP/MIME provides an excellent
way to handle HTML email.  But your email did make me
think about that a bit more.  Obviously, its ability
to load external images might make the signature in
practice meaningless (though the signature on the
source code would still be correct, which makes it an
interesting philosophical point).  Is there anything
else about an HTML email that raises a red flag from a
security point of view?

What is it about the PGP/MIME spec that makes it not
play nicely with HTML email?  Or vice versa?
I've always assumed that lack of HTML support said
more about the crypto crowd's preference for text
email than some technical problem, but perhaps I was

Well, of course, I suppose you are right.  But context
is everything - I was using the term in the sense I
understood others in the thread were using it, that is
to say the HTML emails generated by popular email
clients.  That is what people most often seem to miss
when they move to encrypted email, and is what prompts
the FAQ on this on other lists.
In any case, my question still stands. I don't see why
anyone would wish to send this stuff - but given that
they do is there a way to let them do it securely?[*] I want to understand the technical problems that
others have alluded to better.
[*] Securely here can only mean with the kind of
integrity that gpg provides - ie. knowing that you are
seeing the message that the sender intended.  If HTML
email opens up other security problems, that's not the
job of gpg to prevent.
Best, N.
