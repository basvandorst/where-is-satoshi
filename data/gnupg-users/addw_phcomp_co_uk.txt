The other thing to bear in mind is that there have been some recent cases of
people impersonating policemen - so you do need to ask them to identify
themselves and prove who they are. If you do not then you would fall foul
of the data protection act.

@_subject: gpg - what are the strange characters ? 
I have been generating GPG keys, when it does it GPG prints out strings of '+.-<>' (see below).
What are these characters, I can see that it is trying to show progress, but what do
the different characters mean ?
I am running CentOS 5, so the version of gnupg is 1.4.5
I did have a look at the source.
My first mistake was to download the latest version, the messages that I
was looking for to locate it were in gnypg-1.4 and there abouts, but not in gnupg-2.0.7.
Well: the meanings are progress and the characters mean different things depending on
what sort of encryption algorithm you have chosen and quite what that is doing at
the moment... things that not very clear (to me at least).
   .   when it gets some random bits.
   when generating a key ''Generate a random secret exponent k from prime p, so that k is
   +   k < (p-1)
   -   k > 0
   .   k is relatively prime to (p-1)
   .   when it gets some random bits.
   Generate a random secret exponent k less than q
   +   k < q
   -   k > 0
   !   allocate new primes - goto next try
   >   nprime < pbits 20 times
   <   nprime > pbits 20 times
   ^   iteration of loop creating a generator
   .   (o/p several places), not a prime, failed 10 times at finding a prime
   :   Starting with a new random value
   +   May be a prime
The above lack of understanding not helped by the sparse commenting techniques used in the code :-(
All in the cipher/ directory.
Does what I learned leave me any the wiser ? Not at all.
Do take the above with a shovel full of salt.
If anyone can show me to be wrong:
a) I would not be surprised
b) I would be interested in a clearer description of what is going on
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
Not enough random bytes available.  Please do some other work to give
the OS a chance to collect more entropy! (Need 283 more bytes)
