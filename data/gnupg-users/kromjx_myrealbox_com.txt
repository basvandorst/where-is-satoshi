@_subject: encrypt multiple files into one singlefile and then decrypt	back the original multipe files 
Doug Gorley:
Try the following instead:
   tar -c *.jpg | gpg -ear douggorley > files.tar.gz.asc
No need to compress the tar file with -z; gnupg will compress its input.
Don't use the -t (text) option of gnupg.
