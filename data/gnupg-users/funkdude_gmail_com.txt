@_subject: GnuPG (win32) on a USB stick 
I want to keep GnuPG on a USB stick to use at school and on other people's
computers (all windows). However, GPG, when run, creates the keyrings and
conf files on the HDD (documents and settings\appdata). Is it possible to
avoid this behavior and have GnuPG write those files, say, in its own dir on
my usb stick? How would I do this?
Also, this would probably have to involve me keeping my private key on the
usb stick, protected only by a passphrase. How secure is this? Are there any
better ways to do it?
Thanks in advance.

Thanks everyone of you, you have greatly enlightened me concerning the
security risks associated with my endeavor. I will have to rethink my plans,
but for now, I think John's idea of setting GNUPGHOME seems like the best
idea to me.
However, for convenience, I'd like to maybe use a batch file to set it and
open a command prompt. This would require me to be able to set it to a
relative path (ie, not have to specify a drive letter, as it will change).
Is this possible?
As for GPGShell, it seems pretty good, but I'd prefer to just keep my old
command line if I can.
The last version of GPG2Go I could find is 1.4.1, which seems pretty
outdated. Also, the author says it is the exact same thing as the official
gnupg except repackaged as a zip. Which doesn't solve the problem of gpg
writing to local disks by default.
