But that's the main primary reason of the article at all. The fact
that anyone can upload _every_ key to a keyserver is an issue. If
keyservers would do some sort of verification (e.g. confirmation of
the email addresses) then this would lead to much more reliable data.
Furthermore, we need a feature to allow keys to be removed in case the
true owner of an email address requests it.
I know that this collides with today's keyservers and it also collides
with keyservers exchanging keys between each other, but I strongly
believe that this would make keyservers more trustworthy than today.

@_subject: Proposal of OpenPGP Email Validation 
If the email can be decrypted, then any email can be decrypted, which
would turn OpenPGP useless.
If (and only if) the user stores his private key on his computer, and
the connection to the validating key server is HTTPS with PFS, I don't
really agree.
In any case, the target users are not the Edward Snowdens of this world,
but the 99% of people who just want to communicate easily with each
other and don't want to be bothered too much with key complicated key
lookup/verification scenarios.
The idea is that these servers are separate from the keyserver network.
That is, a relatively small set of servers that would only do validation
of email addresses. Validated keys would then be uploaded to normal key
True, but this only serves the purpose of spamming someone without any
further action. You cannot send specific text to those who get spammed,
that's thus not very interesting. But in general, that's certainly
something to consider (such as only accepting one key at a time and only
accepting N keys per hour from some IP address).
That's a good idea indeed.
Sounds like a good idea.

This allows me to have patrick at enigmail.net verified OK. Then I add a
new UID mallory at evil.com and delete patrick at enigmail.net from the key.
And then I upload my key to the keyservers network, and I'll end up
where we are now.
The whole point of this exercise is to verify that the key and the email
address(es) belong _together_. I don't see how PoW could do this, or I
didn't understand it well enough.

I would not go that far as trying to guarantee the identity of key.
But I think if a keyserver could do some basic verification of keys,
it would make OpenPGP a lot easier to use for email.
The idea I have in mind is roughly as follows: if you upload a key to
a keyserver, the keyserver would send an encrypted email to every UID
in the key. Each encrypted mail contains a unique link to confirm the
email address. Once all email addresses are confirmed, the key is
validated and the keyserver will allow access to it just like with any
regular keyserver.
This way, we have a simple verification of the access to the private
the key, as well as access to the email addresses contained in the UID
by quite a simple means. I would say this is about as reliable as
sending an email to someone requesting their key.

Hash: SHA256
The following press release was published yesterday (unfortunately I
had no time to re-post it earlier):
Encryption add-on Enigmail and pretty Easy privacy (p?p)[1] are
joining in development of a solution for the well-known mail client
Thunderbird. The goal is to make encryption as easy as possible, said
Enigmail's project lead Patrick Brunschwig and p?p's head of
development Volker Birk in a common press release. Enigmail and p?p
will offer p?p technology for any Thunderbird user. Thunderbird is
still most popular among free email programs on desktop PCs and Laptops.
"Enigmail offers the most-used solution for mail encryption as Free
Software for many years now. But we don't want to rest on our
laurels.", Brunschwig explains. "Still way too few people are able to
encrypt. But this is inevitable to protect privacy." That is to be
changed with the partnership. "p?p is offering the possibility to
encrypt fully automatically. This way our users are gaining the
highest amount of security, while even not be touched by the process
at all. At the same time p?p is offering compatibility to OpenPGP and
S/MIME, which is necessary to integrate into mail infrastructures."
"Being the trailblazer, Enigmail managed to provide one of the
greatest user interfaces for mail encryption.", Birk says. "To date
Enigmail is still the front-runner here. Together with Enigmail we're
thinking beyond this: the default for email has to be encrypted and
not unencrypted! For this purpose p?p is offering the possibility to
encrypt without any user interaction needed like managing keys.
Thunderbird is for p?p a strategic platform in Free Software: no other
free mail program has reached this spread. Therefore, it was the
logical choice to ask our colleagues at Enigmail for a cooperation.
Who else could deliver more know-how of integrating encryption into
The development partnership is meant to lead into common project
Enigmail/p?p. As release date for a very first version Enigmail and
p?p are aiming for December 2015.

This is an event open for anybody involved in the development of email
clients using OpenPGP for encryption, and related software.
In 2015 and 2016 we already had tree OpenPGP Email Summits. These are
meetings by technical experts of projects and tools dealing with OpenPGP
with a focus on email encryption. The goals are to better get to know
each other, and to discuss and work on several technical issues that
hopefully improve certain aspects of OpenPGP-based email encryption.

 patrick at enigmail.net
I will then let you know more details about the location, hotel, etc.
If you need funding for your travel/hotel expenses, then please also get
in contact with me.
This is a meeting of those who develop software. Thus, we will have a
lot of tech talk about key servers, key exchange, subject encryption,
password recovery, etc. If you just are interested in these topics as a
user, you probably will be bored to death ;-).
Thus, feel free to join us if you are working in the area of
- TECHNICAL DETAILS
- for SENDING or PROCESSING ENCRYPTED EMAILS
- with OpenPGP
- in a project or product.
Note however, that due to capacity reasons we cannot have more
than 1-2 people from each project. We can host about 30 attendees.
Note that this is still neither a well-organized conference nor a
commercial meeting. The agenda will be driven by the attendees. Anyone
may propose any topic for discussion, as long as he/she is ready to lead
the discussion.
More details are/will be available on the web site:

@_subject: Breaking MIME concatenation 
I already tried a while ago to trick the Thunderbird HTML rendering
engine with tricks like this... They don't work. The rendering engine
ignores the  tag (and also tags like ).
I think the correct solution must be to treat each MIME part
independently, i.e. it needs to be parsed independently by the HTML
engine and produce its own DOM tree. At the end, you can concatenate
these DOM trees and create a single correct HTML document.

@_author: Patrick Brunschwig 
@_subject: Breaking MIME concatenation 
I have actually thought through this during a sleepless night, and I
believe that it could work as a quick and easy to implement *short term*
measure until the mail clients have fixed the HTML rendering.
If we embed the complete result that we get from gpg into the following
wrapper, then we should be able to mitigate at least any known form of
the attack when it comes to calling a remote URL during message reading:
Content-Description: Efail protection wrapper
(result of PGP/MIME decryption)
Does anyone see a major hole in this that I may have overseen? If not,
then I think I'll implement this in Enigmail until Thunderbird has fixed
this properly.

@_subject: Efail or OpenPGP is safer than S/MIME 
So, just that you are aware of the consequences of this change. I
implemented the check for "gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity
protected" in Enigmail 2.0.4.
Within 12 hours after the release I got 5 bug reports/support requests
from users who can't read their (old?) mails anymore. And the day in
Europe has only just begun -- many users did not yet upgrade ...

@_date: 2018-05-17 10:24:59
@_author: Patrick Brunschwig 
@_subject: Breaking MIME concatenation 
At least in Enigmail, inline-PGP is not affected by remote URL calls.
The reason is that Enigmail reads the encrypted message data from the
displayed message, and then replaces the displayed message content with
the decrypted message. In other words, if the secretly to-be-decrypted
message part is not displayed, then Enigmail won't come into action.
The same is currently being developed in Thunderbird (using the "Simple
HTML" mode), together with a clean fix for the DOM tree issues.

@_subject: Efail or OpenPGP is safer than S/MIME 
Good question... Thunderbird is working on fixing the HTML display
issue. But I think we should really start enforcing users to enable MDC.
I therefore would prefer keeping the barrier high. In any case, this is
nothing that I could implement with a week or two.

How far back will that solution work? I.e. is this supported by all
2.0.x and 2.2.x versions of gpg?

@_author: Patrick Brunschwig 
@_subject: Efail or OpenPGP is safer than S/MIME 
Enigmail runs on many long-term Linux distributions that still ship
older, presumably patched, versions of GnuPG. For example, Red Hat EL
6.9/Centos 6.9 contains GnuPG 2.0.14, but current versions of Thunderbird.
GnuPG 2.0.x will therefore still be relevant for me for many years to come.

@_subject: Efail - Possible Measures? 
In the light of the Efail vulnerability I am asking myself if it's
really needed to decrypt non-regular types of emails at all. In other
words, should we decrypt a multipart/encrypted MIME part at all if we
detect an irregular MIME structure?
If we would not decrypt irregular MIME structures, there cannot be an
issue with HTML displaying. This would be a good thing, if you're an
addon and you can't change the application you live in. I know that some
mail clients do this already, but all those clients that are affected by
Efail apparently don't.
I would consider the following "regular" MIME structures:
1. top-level MIME part is multipart/encrypted.
2. an attached email (Content-Type = message/rfc822) containing a
multipart/encrypted MIME part as direct child.
Does anyone know of other relevant types of message structures?
Does anyone see a reason why NOT to do that?

@_author: Patrick Brunschwig 
@_subject: Enigmail 
I'm sorry, but there's a misunderstanding. Enigmail does /not/ query
your passphrase. Enigmail calls GnuPG, and GnuPG asks for your
passphrase if needed. If the passphrase is rejected that's not related
to Enigmail.

@_author: Patrick Brunschwig 
@_subject: Enigmail 
I start to believe that your expectation of what should happen differs
from what actually happens.
The way things work in Enigmail are as follows: you select a *sender
account* in the Thunderbird message composition window. Based on that
sender account configuration (and nothing else), Enigmail decides which
key to use for *signing* your message. Remember, the passphrase is
needed for signing, not for encryption -  it does not matter if
Postmaster or Erich are in the recipients list.
If you get a dialog to choose the key(s) _after_ you hit the send
button, then those are the keys to which the message is *encrypted* to.
But again, you don't need a passphrase for any of these keys. Thus, if
you tell me that you expected to have to tick Postmaster in the dialog,
then that won't let you choose the key for signing.

This is mostly a summary of the various failures that were discovered
with EFAIL and shortly thereafter. Most MUAs have been fixed against
these attacks by now.
For example, the tests with Enigmail were performed using version 1.9.8,
which was released almost 2 years ago, that is long before EFAIL was
published. The same is true for most other products.

I can only speak for Enigmail (and to some degree for Thunderbird).
The errors described where Enigmail is mentioned/affected were all
discovered last spring/summer (i.e. shortly after EFAIL), and were
addressed last year.

@_subject: Future OpenPGP Support in Thunderbird 
The Thunderbird developers have announced that they will implement
OpenPGP support in Thunderbird 78 [1]. Support for Thunderbird in
Enigmail will therefore be discontinued.
I'd like to explain in the following paragraphs what this will mean for
Enigmail, and why this is an inevitable step.
The Future of Enigmail
The Mozilla developers have been and still are actively working on
removing old code from their code base. This affects not only
Thunderbird itself, but also add-ons. While it was possible for
Thunderbird to keep old "legacy" add-ons alive for a certain time, the
time has come for Thunderbird to stop supporting them [2]. Thunderbird
78 will no longer to support the APIs that Enigmail requires and only
allow new "WebExtensions".
WebExtensions have a completely different API than classical add-ons,
and a much reduced set of capabilities to hook into the user interface.
For Enigmail to continue to work, it would therefore be required to
rewrite it from scratch. However, that's beyond my available time
The Thunderbird developers and I have therefore agreed that it's much
better to implement OpenPGP support directly in Thunderbird. The set of
functionalities will be different than what Enigmail offers, and at
least initially likely be less feature-rich. But in my eyes, this is by
far outweighed by the fact that OpenPGP will be part of Thunderbird and
no add-on and no third-party tool will be required.

The vast majority of users of Enigmail (somewhere around 98%) don't use
external built keys. The vast majority of users also don't use GnuPG for
anything else than email. These users don't care where their key is
stored, nor which software under the hood is used for the crypto. All
they care is that encryption works smoothly.
I'm sorry, but everything written here is pure speculation. We are still
in the phase of considering our options. Depending on the chosen
approach, we may just as well end up with something completely different
than what you'd imagine.
The most important aspects from our side are the following: The chosen
solution must run smoothly for the ~20M users of Thunderbird without
causing a large amount of support/setup issues. We want to have
something that satisfies as many users of Enigmail as possible. We
certainly don't want to have people run away from Thunderbird because of

I think there are two reasons why TB changed their minds:
1. there are different people working on Thunderbird than years ago.
2. in the past, TB was a direct part of Mozilla. Now, Thunderbird is an
independent organization under the umbrella of the Mozilla Foundation,
with an independent council and their own independent financial income
These two factors lead to a completely different mindset towards what is
good for TB.

The current stable version of Thunderbird is 68 (and 60 for a few more
weeks); the next stable version will be 78. Users of Enigmail staying on
the stable version of Thunderbird will receive all security updates
until TB 78 will be available. Thunderbird 69 ... 77 are only released
as beta versions that are not intended for end users.

You can be certain that I'd never implement that.
Yes, I did and do get quite a lot of debugging log files, and even more
support requests. And I really speak from experience when I say that the
vast majority of the users of Enigmail don't store their private keys on
external devices.
I have almost 17 years of experience with supporting Enigmail. About 90%
of all support requests that I get turn out to be setup issues with
GnuPG. Interestingly, most of them are on Linux, even though all Linux
distributions I know ship GnuPG. The bundling/shipping would not be a
worry for me. The main problem is the additional complexity that it
brings if you require an external component that you cannot *fully*
control. This covers topics like different behavior of different
versions, but also configuration issues, users rights to install
something on their PC and more. Gpgme may handle some of these issues,
but the fact remains: an external component makes things a lot more
complex, especially for support.

Which is why the step to implement OpenPGP in Thunderbird is the right
way to go.
We're getting slightly off-topic, but still:
You're perfectly right with everything you say. But you seem to
underestimate the difference between zipping an extension that is pure
JavaScript, and preparing an extension that needs to contain compiled
libraries for multiple platforms in order to cater for all variants of
pre-installed GnuPG installations and all variations of Thunderbird
installations (to be precise, at the very least I'd have to ship for 6
platforms: Win/mac/Linux * 32/64 bit).
Frankly speaking, if I would consider to switch to a library instead of
calling GnuPG directly, I would at first evaluate OpenPGP.js in Enigmail

In all cases, we certainly won't re-write GnuPG or similar. The question
on the table is: do we continue to use GnuPG (be it directly or via
gpgme), or do we use a different OpenPGP implementation (and if yes
which one). There are certainly good arguments for both.

That's only the 2nd half of the explanation. 1st and foremost, the
changed plugin scheme comes along with a completely new API (that does
not even exist completely by now). This would require me to rewrite
almost all of Enigmail from scratch. I don't have enough free time for
doing that, nor would I be interested in it. This, and nothing else, was
initially the reason why we started the discussion with the Thunderbird

Bjarni Runar Einarsson wrote on 23.10.2019 21:35:
Your guess is perfectly right, that's exactly what happens. Enigmail
uses a standard library provided by Mozilla for add-ons to execute
processes. Earlier versions of the library did close all file
descriptors correctly. But the library is written in JavaScript, and
closing all file descriptors could sometimes lead to Thunderbird/Firefox
crashes. Therefore that part has been disabled.
It's therefore not surprising to see such open connections from gpg
processes, but I don't consider this bad.

I'm sorry, but that is simply not true. There is a known bug in the
library used by Thunderbird (RNP) that leads to crashes when importing
_certain_ keys. But I succeeded in importing all of my keys without any
problems (more than 1.000), except for 5 V3-keys. I can definitely say
that it's not just broken, and it can import keys.
Again, that's oversimplified. OpenPGP will not be enabled _by_ _default_
but users may still enable it manually.
No, it's incomplete - work in progress. That's not quite the same.

The use-cases are clearly distinct:

- decryption: you only need secret keys
- signing: you only need secret keys

That's not supported by Thunderbird. The idea of OpenPGP in Thunderbird
is that you use it for email.
The only "problem" might be that you have different keys on different
key rings. But this is not necessarily a problem - you use different
keys for different purposes and you can import and export the keys
between the tools if needed.

Let's first define Standard users. The majority of users who use
smartcards that *I* know are expert or power users. They can handle this.
The "Standard users" I have in mind don't use GnuPG for anything else
than encrypting mails, and they don't use smartcards either. They won't
have this issue in any way.
For which use-case precisely? If you only use OpenPGP for emails (and
given the users I know who had support cases in the past, this is true
for the majority of the Enigmail users), then this is irrelevant.
To be quite clear: Thunderbird will not support GnuPG for scenarios
other than handling secret keys. And that's only because the OpenPGP
library they use can't handle smartcards yet. Once the library will
support smartcards, I expect that GnuPG support will be removed entirely.
Note: I'm not a Thunderbird developer and I don't drive Thunderbird
decisions -- this is simply my expectation of what will happen.
