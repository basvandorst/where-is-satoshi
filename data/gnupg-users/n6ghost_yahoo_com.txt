I recently, generated a new keypair (GPG4win), and the defaults presented where RSA/2048. I did, some digging around on the RSA vs DSA thing and RSA still seems
to be the recommended way to go, the only thing I did was up my key size to 4096 I left all the other defaults.....

I just finished reading the article, I don't know anyone who does all of those things. most people I know
who are advid GPG users, gen a key, maybe a revoke, upload it to a keyserver sometimes. and that's about it.
using subkeys, offline keys etc, adds way more complexity to something arguably that's already complex.
anykind of "best practice", should be simple, so that it encourages a sane baseline for people. things like
RSA vs DSA, key size etc, should be in it. not a long doc that that has you doing primary and secondary?
keys.... ??

yea, compatibility is a big issue from what I understand RSA is far more
compatible than DSA is. which is why i use an RSA key, though a larger

how did you get, security vs illusionary security from that? and while
I agree that "security" is not well defined, in a way that a user or
admin can tell what level of security an object or configuration will
give him.
that does not mean we should get all hyper paranoid on all of our best
practices and guidelines to a point where only advanced geeks can
understand it.
for things, like encryption we, should make an effort for the
baselines to be sane, and simple. leave the more advanced stuff to the
advanced users. I have found that, when something is complex and or
hard to use
users will not use it, or will find ways around it.

watched the video, its amazing how much is broken and that GPG and OTR are not.

I believe the recommendation from the GPG folks is a 2048 key pair. But I have seen some of the more paranoid privacy folks doing 4096 key pairs.
Other than that most of the defaults are good.
