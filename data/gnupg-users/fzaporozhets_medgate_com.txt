@_subject: Question from GPG 
Good afternoon,
I have one problem encrypting the file using gnupg.
When I run:
cmd/c c:\gnu\GnuPG\gpg --homedir C:\GNU\GnuPG\pubrings\ --yes -e -r
"E3655B17" Medgate_LeaveOgAbsenceStatus_2009-05-20.csv 2>errors.txt
I'm getting the question:
pub  2048g/5A85DEB2 2008-07-14 Schneider B2B Services - UAT/Training
(UAT and Training Key.)  Primary key fingerprint: C2C0 304A E23A D0F5 2911  AE4F 0EBD 3829 E365
      Subkey fingerprint: 40F1 EC5E 7BD0 B69B F0A2  96DC 4CF4 BFE6 5A85
It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named in the user
ID.  If you *really* know what you are doing, you may answer the next
question with yes.
Use this key anyway? (y/N)
I did trust and signed the key before:
C:\GNU\GnuPG>gpg --edit-key E3655B17

[ultimate] (1). Schneider B2B Services - UAT/Training (UAT and Training
Key.) "Schneider B2B Services - UAT/Training (UAT and Training Key.)
" was already signed by key 0CA9461C
Nothing to sign with key 0CA9461C
Key not changed so no update needed.
What could be a problem?
Doing a Google search didn't really shed any new light on this either.  I need to schedule automatic process and this confirmation question does
not let me do it.
I'll appreciate any advice.
