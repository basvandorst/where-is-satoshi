@_subject: Garbled data in keyservers 
Hi everyone,
I'm experiencing a strange behavior when looking for my email address on
many keyserver web interfaces: I get al lot of garbled output from a key
of someone else.
I can't find and answer in this mailing list archives, so I decided to
ask directly. Forgive me if it's a silly question.
How to test this:
1) pick any keyserver, I tried   ,
 , 2) search any key but mine by email: works? Well, so it was for me
3) now try with this email address
On pool.sks-keyservers.net eveything works well while on other
keyservers I get 47Mb of garbled data from Yegor Timoshenko key, which I
never signed and I don't know exactly why it's included in search
results. I had to use wget to download the web page since any browser
will crash.
Is this a bug I should submit somewhere? Can a key break the html output of a keyserver?
Thanks you for your time ;-)
