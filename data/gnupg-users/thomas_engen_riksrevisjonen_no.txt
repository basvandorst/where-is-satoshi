@_subject: GPG Executable for Windows 
Hi !
I have downloaded a zipped file (gnupg-w32-1.0.6.zip) from that contains a executable GPG.exe (command line) for windows=20
In generating a key, i can choose between DSA and/or ElGamal.
But is there any executable file for GPG for Windows where i can choose
among RSA, AES, 3DES, Blowfish, Twofish, CAST5, MD5, SHA-1, RIPE-MD-160
and TIGER.=20
Thank you

Hi !
Do anyone know the commandline to use when i want to decrypt a file
automatic and have a PASSPHRASE ?
I can't find this with gpg -h or anywhere in the documentation.
Thank you
