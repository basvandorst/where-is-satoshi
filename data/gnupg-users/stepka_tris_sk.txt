I started to use GnuPG more seriously when I migrated to KMail from Netscape Communicator. I have some questions. Far ago I created key pair for one e-mail address which is not valid any more. I also submit that key to public key server. I lost key pairs for that address. Of coarse I can download back public key, but secret one is does not exist any more. Is there way to remove obsolete public key from servers or will it stay there forever?
Another quesion will be similar to previous one. I created key pair and one extra UID for that key pair and submitted public key to servers. Afterwards I removed UID and exports key again, but UID stay on servers. Is there way to submit key again without extra UID?
My last question is about signing. I don't sign keys of persons which I personally don't know. But if my public key is signed with someone do I need import it to my keyring again and then submit it to public servers so others can read signature? Probably stupid question, but I didn't find any suitable text which discuss this topic in enough depth.
Thanks a lot. Marian
