why? he states:
"To a user of cryptographic systems -- as I assume most readers are --
this news is important, but not particularly worrisome.  MD5 and SHA
aren't suddenly insecure.  No one is going to be breaking digital
signatures or reading encrypted messages anytime soon with these
techniques.  The electronic world is no less secure after these
announcements than it was before."

Hi list,
this might be of interest to German subscribers.
In 9 days there's the "Chemnitzer Linux-Tage 2005".
Of course there will be a Key Signing Party again, but you have to
send in your public key(s) by tomorrow at he latest if you want to
I'll attend so maybe see you there.

I don't have the time to test it right now, but I believe so. Given

test it with my main keys, eh ;-)
Anyway, if you already temper with UIDs, just add a new one (of

This won't affect the other UIDs' signatures.

@_subject: ECC 
Nah, totally beyond me...
Well, to clarify things: From an end user's point of view, it would
have been nice to have an app to play with. I'd like to switch to ECC
too. Mainly, because I think that the guys with the small ... glasses
;-) at NSA can break public key crypto quite easily, and secondly I
like to play with new apps. So, if there is not an app which uses the
ECC lib, that's too bad; I won't bother any further with that lib,
just a matter of lack of time. We really need to change the social
system to a more star trek like system....

Well... please understand that it is my personal belief; just like

what you are looking for :-)
I put the speculations aside and stick with the fact that the NSA
recommends ECC for government use. That's enough for _me_.

As I said, I put the speculations aside. I see no point diving into
the matter like that. Consistently, and quite sadly, this reminds me
of 9/11. When I refused to accept the official story of Osama and his
19 bandits (still do; f.e. their ridiculous story of burning jet fuel
being able to bring down the towers; quite a laugh), I was called a
conspiracy theorist; just for saying "I'm not buying the official
story.", period. I did not offer alternatives;I was just saying,
plain & simple, that it can't be THAT way because of numerous facts.
See, I don't go any further than the NSA's recommendation here; in
this case this is enough for me, I most certainly do not want to draw
an analogy between PKC & 9/11 because that would take much much more
than some limpering analogy at best, eh ;-). I don't care about other
views on the matter (NSA & PKC); I don't ask acceptance, only mere
tolerance. Curiousity is a good thing, but there are times when too
much of it will spoil things big time. I find it astonishing that
people can't accept facts as such, and what people make of them (eye,
beholder, bells, ringing, ...) _without_ putting speculations aside;
no offense intended.
I could go on ranting... and if one could build a whole new _lasting_
world on speculations I'd be among the first to join.
Well... If one asks them, they most certainly won't give a satisfying
answer I fear ;-)
Or, more precisely, it would take ages. When you take a look at
cryptome.org and some requests regarding the freedom of information
act, it is quite sad to note that it takes a federal angency so much
time to response to simple requests made by a country's citizen.
Not me. ;) I use to say "I'm not paranoid, but the people who hunt me
think I am."

You're right of course, this would be typical behaviour. However...
Some of you got the hint, some didn't: As I said early in this thread
that my opinion of the NSA being able to crack PKC quite easily is
based on my personal belief, *just like one might believe in god or
not*. I do not feel inclined to discuss the matter any further.

@_subject: Disk Partition 
on a sidenote, using /dev/urandom is a bad idea. f.e. the standard
slackware install and other distros as well have the following code
(or something similar) in /etc/rc.d/rc.S:
# Carry an entropy pool between reboots to improve randomness.
if [ -f /etc/random-seed ]; then
  echo "Using /etc/random-seed to initialize /dev/urandom."
  cat /etc/random-seed > /dev/urandom
# Use the pool size from /proc, or 512 bytes:
if [ -r /proc/sys/kernel/random/poolsize ]; then
  dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/random-seed count=1 bs=$(cat
  dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/random-seed count=1 bs=512 2> /dev/null
chmod 600 /etc/random-seed
Guess where's the rub...

@_date: 2005-10-08 01:30:53
@_author: markus reichelt 
@_subject: Disk Partition 
The thing is that re-using pseudo-random data after each reboot and
calling that improvement of randomness is ... quite amusing at best
to me. It's not that it's about the quality of randomness, it's the
plain and simple fact that pseudo-random data (of whatever quality)
is reused and that should not happen when it comes to crypto stuff.
Don't know how well founded you need that, but I'm listening :)

@_date: 2005-10-08 03:01:59
@_author: markus reichelt 
@_subject: Disk Partition 
That is not my point, tho this might be the case. :)
If this generated data is used once, it's ok. If not, then there's a
problem. /dev/urandom is not as random as it might seem to the
ordinary user, that's what I'm trying to point out by having posted
the relevant part of a slackware boot init script. The discrepancy
lies in what the comment says and what the shell code actually does.
If an attacker gains access to random-seed, which has already been
used in cryptographic operations, it is to his advantage. The
ordinary user just doesn't want that, and is most likely not aware of
this flaw/possibility.
The best analogy would be the one-time pad. It's very secure if used
once, but if the same one-time pad is used twice, an attacker has a
foot in the door (if he intercepts relevant data, etc etc). I believe
this is what happened to some Soviet codes during the cold war.
One-time pads were reused which allowed American codebreakers to
eavesdrop. Anyway, this leads away from the topic at hand, so...
Ack on that, and it is sufficient to use this pseudo-random data
once. Emphasis lies on once. If need be, just generate some chunk of
pseudo-random data again. The ordinary user most likely isn't aware
that /dev/urandom is initialized by re-using pseudo-random data. The
re-usage is the problematic thing. When reading the init scripts
(what even less users actually do...) they believe what the comments
say, hence ppl point out not to use /dev/urandom the way it is set up
on most systems. If in doubt one should have a close look at the
system's init scripts, and don't hesitate to ask.
I have been to some computer fairs and conferences, and each and
every time the crypto ppl never got tired of telling users about such
Cryptographically secure random numbers are f.e. derived from
radioactive decay. John Walker wrote some article about it. But
that's not the point, I don't want to split hairs; and I would not
call 3des secure by any modern standards, even from aspects of
csprng. We most likely are talking at cross-purposes, so I would like
to sum up what is really important to me:
Concerning crypto stuff, using /dev/urandom is a bad idea, if
the quality of randomness of the data is the main concern, the data's
re-usage to initialize at boot a supposedly sufficiently random
device, namely /dev/urandom, is. Most linux distributions initialize
fact, because it often is overlooked. Additionally, it's easily
avoidable and the setup of /dev/urandom should be changed in
distributions which use the procedure.

@_subject: Delete key from keyserver 
of course it's not scalable. the web of trust exists for a reason :)
everything comes at a price. that's why there are key signing
parties, to meet and exchange signatures; that would not have
happened under normal circumstances. after having been on some key
signing parties, that all follow the same basic procedures (check key
ID & the identity of its owner), i can only recommend to attend one.
well, the WoT clearly indicates that one should not trust a key until
one can resonably sure by means that oneself deems fit. one just does
not have to find a complete link; to some extend, one just has to lay
emphasis on "trust". the level of signature, in my point of view,
emphasises this issue.
f.e. real life people use key signing robots. i don't, cos i only
sign keys of real people. i distinguish between having met in real
life, having verified one's identitiy in best possible terms
(resulting in level 3 sigs) and level 2 sigs that sufficiently match
my criteria for signing. level 2 signatures don't require having met in person. there are
schemes to sufficiently prove the signee's identity.
well, to some extent one has to make a compromise. for that reason
key signing policies exist. check the web and create your own. i'm
sure there you can exchange key fingerprints over the telephone :)
and i encourage you to use that feature. keep in mind that it's totally up to yourself with which level of
signature you sign a key. however, i strongly suggest cross-signing.
imagine you would find two telephone numbers listed in a directory
under the very same name. how are you to decide which one of these
numbers is the correct one? the number of ppl also listing one number
in a commercial directory, e.g. "having conducted successfull
business with" is equal. again, what would you do?
you can't solely rely on email. period. one just has to resort to
some sort of instant communication. be it classical telephone,
instant messanger, whatever. even snail mail might do the trick for
you.... you chose. you sign. it's your call.
well, let's ignore this one for the sake of key signatures, will you?
a good sense of paranoia is good, but it really can be distracting

first time that i stumble upon this kind of advice; it depends, i'd
