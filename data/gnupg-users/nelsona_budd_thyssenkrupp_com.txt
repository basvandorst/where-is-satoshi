Hi all,
Receiving the following error when trying to encrypt a file with someone's
public key
Could not find a valid trust path to the key.  Let's see whether we
can assign some missing owner trust values.
No path leading to one of our keys found.
**then it list the contents of the key**
It is NOT certain that the key belongs to its owner.
If you *really* know what you are doing, you may answer
the next question with yes
Anyone seen this before???
