@_subject: gen-key can't create .gnupg directory 
I just installed gpg and get the following errors from --gen-key:
gpg: keyblock resource `/home/jhughes/.gnupg': file open error
gpg: can add keyblock file `/home/jhughes/.gnupg/pubring.gpg'
Key generation failed: file create error
gpg: can't create `/home/jhughes/.gnupg/random_seed': No such file or
I have installed gpg on another system with absolutely no problem.

@_subject: gpg won't decrypt 
I have --gen-key'd a private/public pair. --list-keys verifies that the
keys exist. I have one other key on my keyring. When I try to decrypt
messages from this other person, I get:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID F7290FE0
gpg: no secret key for decryption available
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
However, --list-secret-keys shows that it is available.
