I am able to sign and or encrpyt my mails. To do this, I have ordered an demonstration certificate from GlobalSign. Their root certificate is installed in most browsers and mail readers.
The problem I have, is that the "middle"-certificates, i.e. the certificates in the chain between my user certificate and the root certificate, are not sent along. This results in complaints about not being able to verify my Is there any possibility to send these certificates along?
I use KMail (which uses Kleopatra) and gpgsm.
Thanks a lot in advance for any answer.
Regards, Daniel

Thanks for your reply.
That's right, but I want to avoid this. This is also the reason why I have chosen a CA whose certificates are pre-installed.
This is just the option I needed. Unfortunately I cannot set it in KMail, as I am not able to find it there. (Ubuntu with KDE 3.5.6 and KMail 1.9.6).
But setting the option directly in gpgsm.conf works perfectly.
