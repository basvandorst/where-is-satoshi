@_subject: New Implementation for Elliptic Curve Crypt 
Good information. Also I like to say that GnuPG has an _experimental_ patch that allow to use Elliptic curves over primary fields (F_{p}):
(If you read the writer's names, then you can understand why i like to say it)
Over the fields that certicom devel (F_{2^m}), there are free implementation (as GPL) in:
In the downloads, you can find a readme in english. (Mainly it's in spanish, but if you have doubts the author Manuel Pancorbo Castro (or I, if is needed) can solve it).

Your passphrase is the last bastion of your key. Your secret key are
protected with this string. If you forget it, you are in the same
situation that an eavesdroper.
Without your secret key, or access to it, you cannot revoke it. I always
advise to generate a generic revoke cert, and save it (like in paper);
but normally i will forget where i save it.
You nonsingle you have lose your access to the secret, you lose access
to all the messeges encrypted for you with this key.

Could be better:
tar cf - /home/user1/* | gpg -er 0x01234567 - > And in $? you should have the return code.
isn't it?

I don't know it either. But how you download the rpm file, maybe by ftp? check binary or ascii transmision. It's only an idea.

Ok, now it works, but can you send me any information that could be interesting? For example how you create the 0xC9541FB2, is it over finite fields o elliptics? Length, and this characteristics. Or what operations you did with patched gpg.
Over a patched gpg, could you have problems finite fields that you haven't on the official version. I could broke something (for sure accidentally) in the patch... Maybe the patch hurt the key ring.

Hey! Too much things to answer... I will only respond some that I can know the answer, sorry.

Think, for example that you want to send 100MB of information to 10 people. With in a pure asymmetric system yo will encrypt it one by one and then send at less 1GB (possible more). Using a hybric scheme (not less secure) you will send 100MB symmetrically encrypted and a little more of 10k where you have the symmetric key encrypted one by one.
To stablish the equivalence of security between different algorithm, also from different nature (like compare symmetric/asymmetric) we could use a formula that relates how many basic operations are needed to broke it, with how many basic operations the computer could do per second. Then you have one very much optimistic time.
If some one find a new atack to one cryptosystem, this equivalences will Sorry for the partial answer. Some one else could answer you better than I.

Ok, in this case (David correct me if i am wrong) it look like there was something broke in the pubring that was fixed when you ran '--update-trustdb' (over an unpatched binary).
Now you haven't any problem. All works fine? I, also, download this key in my pubring without problems.
I remark: this ecc patch is _experimental_, use it carefully!

Right now, I don't know if the root problem came from the patch. As you say this patch only add mathematical and cryptographic functions to provide elliptic curves over finite fields.
I run a patched binary usually. I trust in it, but always I have rings backup. There is _not knowed_ bugs, but it is a relative new code that need more hack, and also it will receive improvements.
Thank you to use the patch and never doubt to ask.
