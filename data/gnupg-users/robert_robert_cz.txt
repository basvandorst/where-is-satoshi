@_subject: thunderbird/enigmail install problem: invalid config 
i'm trying to install latest enigmail/gpg following the instructions
at enigmail website  but after
gpg --gen-key
i get only this error
C:\Documents and Settings\Germic>gpg --gen-key
gpg: C:/Documents and Settings/Germic/Data aplikac?/gnupg\gpg.conf:0:
argument not expected
thanks for your help
- robert
ps. my gpg.conf looks like this (exactly as recomended in the
instructions above)
keyserver random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de
default-cert-check-level 3
keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve include-subkeys
# uncomment if you need IDEA, see # load-extension Lib\idea
