@_subject: Get gpg to use keyring files in the current directory 
I'm trying to get gpg to create and use keyryring files in the current In e:\test I have this options file named test.conf :
     utf8-strings
     no-default-keyring
     keyring test-public.keyring
     secret-keyring test-secret.keyring
If I cd to e:\test and use this command line:
     gpg --gen-key --options test.conf
the keyrings are not created in the current directory, but in The options file is read, since the keyring files use the specified names.
I'm using gpg to encrypt small backup files which will be decrypted by non-tech-savvy users that do not
usually use gpg. I'm going to store the keyrings ready for use on a USB-stick and will not know the absolute path
to the keyfiles.
Any suggestions?
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.29 (Gpg4win 2.3.0)
