I've been signing my emails with my gpg key (F65A739E) at least that is what
mutt says.  However,  when it's sent it appears to be signed with a sub key
(B23241CB). Can someone explain the purpose of subordinate keys and what I'm
doing wrong?

Sometime in March Charly Avital assaulted the keyboard and produced:
Ok, that makes sense. I honestly don't remember making the SA key, but
given the time frame it probably happened when I was trying to unexpire the
key F65A739E. Can you elaborate on the reasons for using a separate key for
signing messages?
