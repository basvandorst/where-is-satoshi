@_subject: GPG W32 1.0.6-2 - PRIVATE KEY IMPORT ISSUE 
Hello Sirs,
I downloaded GPG W32 1.0.6-2 on a Windows machine.
I started gpg from the command line and It created C:\gnupg.
I have GPG running on another windows machine (I think is version 1.0.4) so
I tried to import my keys.
For the secretkey I tried like this:
gpg --armor --output "secretkey.txt" --export-secret-keys "My-NAME"
gpg --allow-secret-key-import "secdretkey.txt"
My problem is that after the import command nothing comes out if I enter:
gpg --list-secret-keys
Could you please tell me where I make a mistake ?

I'm now running version 1.4.9 and everything works just fine.
Thank you.
