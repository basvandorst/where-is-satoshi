Does gpg include a wiping feature for temp files, free space,etc? If not, what do people use?

BC-Wipe for windows. Still looking for one for Linux.
Me too.

@_subject: user ID 
I'm having a problem with gnupg-1.0.7-7. The only way I can encrypt a file is to use the "--default-recipient-self" qption. Without that the program asks for my user ID. I've tried everything I can think of, full
name, full name and email address, numerical ID string, full name with comment and email address, and all combinations thereof, all with no luck.
Can someone tell me what the program is looking for?
I'm also having problems with pgp4pine but that's another issue.

No luck. I even tried adding my email address to the encrypt and sign+encrypt filers. was this a mistake? The filters are now:
display-filters  = _LEADING("-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----")_ /usr/bin/gpg-check                                                                      _LEADING("-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----")_ /usr/bin/gpg-check                sending-filters  = /usr/bin/gpg-sign                                                                                                               /usr/bin/gpg-encrypt _RECIPIENTS_ holtzm                                                                              /usr/bin/gpg-sign+encrypt _RECIPIENTS_ holtzm                          There are still no filters offered.
See my other post "user ID" for another slant on this problem. Gnupg worked well before. something has changed  I'm missing something. Any other ideas

Tried it. No luck. Beside, doesn't that just affect the text at the beginning of an encrypted/signed message?
If I'm correct (and I sure don't gaurantee that) in that the display filters only affect the text displayed in the message, I never get that far. The options to filter the message thru gpg (the sending filters) are not displayed when I send the message. Only "send mail?". Yes, gpg-sign, gpg-encrypt, gpg-sign+encrypt, and gpg-check all reside in my /usr/bin directory (RH7.3).
Haven't tried that but I have never seen a file specified with quotes i.e.
            /usr/bin/"gpg-sign"
However, later I'll even try that.

@_subject: gpg usage w/ pine 
I'm running gnupg-1.0.7-7 and pine-4.44-7.73.0 under RH7.3 and after
 [X]  compose-send-offers-first-filter
in pine and noting that the gpg install seems to have created:
display-filters    = "_LEADING(-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----)_"                      "_LEADING(-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----)_" sending-filters     = /usr/bin/gpg-sign
                      /usr/bin/gpg-encrypt _RECIPIENTS_
                      /usr/bin/gpg-sign+encrypt _RECIPIENTS_
no filters are offered when I try to send. No opportunity to encrypt, sign, nothing.
The only way I could get it to work was to install pgp4pine. This is an solution but I can't see why it's neccessary. Is there any way to get away from pgp4pine?
I should mention that gpg works well as a stand alone. I can engrypt, decrypt and sign indidual files.
Any ideas or pointers appreciated. Thanks.

@_subject: pgp4pine problem 
After playing with a few mail programs I installed pine-4.58-1 and pgp4pine-1.76-1. I had run this combination before with success. I am also running gnupg-1.0.6-5 and RH7.3. I know they are old versions but they work well and I intend keeping them if I can. So much for background.
The Problem I'm having is that when I send a test message to myself I get this error:

As I said: "I know they are old versions but they  work well and I intend keeping them if I can" at least they worked in the past. Also I try to use only RPM packages for ease of installation and uninstallation and the later versions of the gpg packages get me into dependency hell. If I can't get the present set up to work I might build a package from a later souce rpm and see what happens.
