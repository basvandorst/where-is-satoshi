@_subject: Crypto Stick vs Smart Card Reader /w Pin Pad 
Is the crypto stick which is fully open source and open hardware more
secure than a Gemalto smart card reader with pin pad built in? Which of
these would make you more of a hard target and increase security.

@_subject: Smart Card 4096 Key Question 
Can an OpenPGP 2.0 smart card hold 3 4096 keys at the same-time?
Additionally could an OpenPGP 2.0 Smart card hold 4 4096 keys as well?
This is assuming you are using a GPG version that supports this. Sorry I
couldnt find this answer online.
