If you double the size of a RSA-modulus (i.e from 512 Bit to 1024 Bit)
there is a huge amount of possible new secret key values (factor 2^512)
if you double the size of a DSS-key not one additional secret key value
is added because the amount of possible secret keys is limited by the
size of the hash-function (160 bits), Only the mathematical operation will use a longer key (as modulus) and consequently takes more time.

That's correct. But if you have to comply with American Standards (DSS)
this would not help, beacause DSS restricts p to 1024 bits and q to 160 bits.
