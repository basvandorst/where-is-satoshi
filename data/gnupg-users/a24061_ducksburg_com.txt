If you want to see the key ID, UIDs and so on that you would be
getting if you imported it, try this:
$ gpg --import -n -vv  FILE
-n is also known as --dry-run.

@_subject: Strange problem with seahorse (and consequently enigmail). 
I have a strange problem with seahorse not working on only one of two
Ubuntu computers.  The gpg-agent works in the curses-like way when I
call gpg in xterm, but seahorse doesn't.  (Because seahorse isn't
working but Thunderbird enigmail detects the agent running, Enigmail
doesn't work either.)  The output 'ps aux OT' after logging into GNOME
includes these commands (with the same start time, owned by my
[seahorse-agent] (On the computer that isn't giving me this problem, the first line is
the same except for the hostname, but the next line says
  /usr/bin/seahorse-agent --execute /usr/bin/gnome-session
and everything works.)
When I try to run 'seahorse-preferences' from a command-line, I get
the following errors:
** (seahorse-preferences:11283): CRITICAL **: init_gpgme: assertion `GPG_IS_OK (err)' failed
** (seahorse-preferences:11283): CRITICAL **: seahorse_pgp_source_init: assertion `GPG_IS_OK (err)' failed
Segmentation fault
I'd be grateful for any suggestions or debugging tips.
I'm using gnupg 1.4.8 and the additional packages listed below.  I've
tried purging and reinstalling most of them.

@_subject: Using gpg-agent like ssh-agent? 
I work with ssh-agent using ssh-add from the command line: "ssh-add
key0 key1 key2" to activate keys (sometimes with -t to set a time
limit), and "ssh-add -d key1" or "ssh-add -D" to deactivate them.
Is there a similar way to work with gpg-agent?

@_subject: Two convicted in U.K. for refusal to decrypt data 
In a stunt organised by the civil liberties group Stand, The Home
   Secretary Jack Straw was sent details to a crime Sunday that could
   earn him up to two years in prison if the controversial e-commerce
   bill were made law.
   ...
   According to Stand an encrypted email was sent to Mr Straw Sunday
   afternoon containing a confession to a real crime. The key to
   decrypt the message will be in Mr Straw's name. Stand will tip off
   the Metropolitan Commissioner of Police Monday, informing him that
   Mr Straw has important information about a crime.
   If the e-commerce bill were in place, Straw would be required to
   hand over the decryption key or face up to two years in prison. "In
   principle, under the bill, Jack Straw would have to prove he never
   had the key in the first place. We are hoping this will help him
   understand that this is unworkable, an intolerable reversal of the
   burden of proof and against the Human Rights Act," Says Malcolm
   Hutty, spokesman for Stand.
