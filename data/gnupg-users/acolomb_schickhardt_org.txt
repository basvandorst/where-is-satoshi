@_subject: Future OpenPGP Support in Thunderbird 
Hi Patrick, Great news overall and thanks for the announcement. Thunderbird with direct OpenPGP integration has long been overdue IMHO.
So according to the wiki page [1] I understand that the secret keys will be managed by Thunderbird. That is quite a limitation I think, in contrast to reusing a GPG agent of some sort. Depending on the chosen alternative, it might offer better OS integration, a long time proven secure process architecture, possible reuse with only one central key store and most of all integration with hardware tokens. I personally would not entrust my private keys to a mail application that also displays HTML and possibly executes JavaScript etc. after what we have seen with Efail for example.
So could you please elaborate or extend the wiki page to clear up how hardware tokens fit into the new picture?
Thanks and kind regards. [1]:
