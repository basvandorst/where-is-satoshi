@_subject: first time gpg automation with perl 
Hi all, I am using shared hosting with an ISP.  gpg 1.06 is installed.
I have got a ssh login and have used gpg via that in my area of the server and it works exactly as expected. but I am prototyping the script to use in an environment where the only access I have to the command line is via backticks from perl.
I have encountered some trouble though and which has eventually resulted in the following script which I wrote to see if it would help me resolve the my $gpgargs = " --version";
my $sentstring = "gpg $gpgargs";
my $returnedstring = `gpg   $gpgargs`;
my $returnedstring2 = `echo "hello carrie"`;
my $returnedstring3 = `pwd`;
my $returnedstring4 = `whoami`;
my $returnedstring5 = `ls -l`;
my $returnedstring6 = `gpg --list-keys`;
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print <
xxxx  $sentstring xxxx $returnedstring xxx echo "hello carrie" xxx $returnedstring2
pwd   xxx $returnedstring3 whoami xxx $returnedstring4
gpg --list-keys xxx $returnedstring6
ls -l xxx $returnedstring5
the output  demonstrates my trouble      * xxxx gpg --version xxxx gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.6 Copyright (C) 2001 Free Software Foundation, Inc. This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

everything works as you would expect except --list-keys and  the other gpg action commands. But I know that I have the priviliges to run these commands because I can run them from my ssh connection. and the script reported that the directory and user (carrie) are the same as they would be from the ssh shell. So why willt it let me execute some commands in gpg but not others?
is there a security setting ? maybe something that stops script access?
any other ideas?
