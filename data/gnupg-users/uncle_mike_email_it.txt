@_subject: gnupg passphrase can't create revocation certificate 
hi all,
yesterday I created a gnupg rsa key and I pubblished it to the mit keyserver
to see how gnupg works.
After that I tried to ceate a revocation certificate, but when I enter the
passphrase the program say "incorrect passphrase" :s
now, i'm sure that the passphrase is "l'hccds:)"
is there a problem whit special chars in gnupg (I'm using ubuntu 10.04lts)?
I also thinked that I wrote wrong password twice times (zero probability gh)
when I created the key and so I used rephrase
( with some patterns like these
with no result
I do not know what to think :(
