@_subject: Can't get key from keyserver: eof 
I have the strangest problem with GPG.  It can't won't talk to any
First, version info:
    gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.0
    Supported algorithms:
    Cipher: IDEA, 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH
    Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA, ELG
    Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160
    gcc version 2.8.1
    HP-UX version 10.20
Here's the error message I get:
    gpg: Signature made Sat, Oct 30, 1999 04:25:24 PM CDT using RSA key ID 766CD151
    gpg: requesting key 766CD151 from wwwkeys.us.pgp.net ...
    gpg: can't get key from keyserver: eof
    gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
I wondered why this would happen, so I tried talking to the server
    % netcat wwwkeys.us.pgp.net 11371

Okay, so the server is reachable, and I can get data from it just fine!
Playing with syscall tracing, I see that gpg opens the connection, sends
the data, and then just disconnects right afterward.  Why would it do
Please CC me, as I am not (yet) subscribed to this list.  Thanks!

I have an update on this problem.  If I comment out the following
statement, it works!
    int
    http_wait_response( HTTP_HD hd, unsigned int *ret_status )
    {
    }
Does anyone have some idea WHY this would be the case?

@_subject: Problems with gpg on HPUX 10.20 
GPG doesn't use "libtool" to build shared objects, and the method chosen
in the Makefiles only works with gcc.  The HP compiler tools are
perfectly capable of building shared objects, but you have to munge the
Makefiles in order to get them to build.
I had done this for my installation of GPG, but I have lost my source
build environment, and I lack the time to go into it just now.  If you
are unable to figure this out, let me know, and I'll see what I can do.
