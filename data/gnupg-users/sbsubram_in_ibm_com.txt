@_subject: Clarification sought on GnuPG v1.4.12 
Hi GPG user group,
I am trying to use Gnu PG v1.4.12 in one of my project.  I have downloaded
the source gnupg-1.4.12-1.aix5.1.ppc.rpm from
      as I could not find any download link for this version in Gnu PG website.
However, I am facing some issues in compiling the source
Is there a link from where I can get the binary of 1.4.12 version, from
where I can download and readily use.
I intend to use this on AIX 5.3 platform
Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks and Regards,
Suresh B Subramanyam
