Hello Rodney,

 Since you're using sylpheed(-claws) you _can_ check
inline sigs (as well as mime) from within sylpheed by using Actions.
The command-line to put in the Actions configuration
is best regards

Hello Newton,

 So, do you see any mention of GnuPG or gpgme in the /Help/About
window? Look in the 'Compiled-in features:...' list.

 There was nothing attached!
Could you send me your config.log?
Off-list would probably be most appropriate.

Hello Graham,

 No, you can use Actions for decrypting as well, using
*gpg --no-tty --command-fd 0 --passphrase-fd 0 --decrypt %f|
in your 'Command line' setting in Actions. There's no need
for all that copy/paste stuff with external programs.

 You can try . AFAIK, that project
contains updated standard perl scripts, so FormMail is probably included.

 How about sylpheed or sylpheed-claws:

IMO Sylpheed(-Claws) is already almost there too. It does already have an=20
easy way to download missing keys (via the Actions feature), but is still=20
lacking support for the encapsulation method.

 It is also used by Claws Mail for its S/MIME plugin.

 And what else did they test besides Kmail?

 That maybe true, but that is not what the OP said exactly. He didn't
say GnuPG's S/MIME implementation passed, he said 'The S/MIME implementation
in KMail'. So, I asked what other MUAs were tested. KMail is not the
only MUA using GnuPG's S/MIME, Claws Mail does too. It's news to me if
Claws Mail was tested - as a member of the dev team I would have expected
to hear about it. So, I wondered, if KMail was the only MUA tested, then
saying it is the only one that passed seems like a bit of semantic trickery,
inferring, as it does, that others failed.

Yes, exactly. That's why I asked what else was tested. I don't see any
misquoting. As you say...

'malfeasance' is a strong word. Alas, it seems that you might be slipping

I didn't say otherwise.

 A perl or php solution should be possible (in theory ;).

@_subject: my signature does not verify! 
Possibly MTA re-encoding broke the sig. It is safer to
use BASE64 encoding rather than 7bit when sending msgs
with inline sigs.

 This has SSL support using gnutls.

 Those magazine articles are almost always sloppy. When do the article
writers ever consult with the developers? Often they seem like they
spend no more 5 minutes 'testing' an app. Even the Claws Mail
information was lacking in this article.
