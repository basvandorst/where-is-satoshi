@_subject: Gnuplugin for outlook 2002 ? 
I try to get microsoft outlook 2002 working with an opengpg version for
windows. I tried this with g-data-gnuplugin, but that doesn't seem to
work with outlook 2002. Does anybody know another solution, because also
winpt doesn't seem to work.

I have some questions: I want to do encrypted communication between three places : one with linux and opengpg (under kmail) , one with microsoft outlook and pgp or gnuplugin and one with pgp version 8, how can I make kmail get working to read the encrypted mails coming from pretty good privacy version 8.
Queston nr. 2 : the person with ms outlook, apparently there is a bug in it, since I can not save or export the public key. Is  this normal with gnuplugin

It is not inline, but /usr/local/lib/cryptplug/gpgme-openpgp.so. My question is more on the level, that opegpg corresponds with pgp (all versions) and if I have to implement somthing special ?

It concerns communication between gnupg (openpgp) and pgp v6.02. From myself (gnupg) to pgp6.02 the messages are readable and decryptable, but from pgp6.02 to gnupg, I have the following problem : I receive these error, when I try to decrypt  : MSWordDocWord.Document.8ô9²qgpg: Signature made Sun Sep 28 11:26:27 2003 CEST using DSA key ID D7733AE6
gpg: Good signature from "xxxxxx"
gpg: binary signature, digest algorithm SHA1
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
Do you know how to resolve this ?

That is a bit strange, because this hasn't been done with kmail, but just with the commandline. gpg. When I use for example kgpg, I receive the error "no user id found". What happens when a person sends an encrypted mail from another emailaddress than the one in the key ? For example somone changes from email address ? Is it possible to add another id to an imported public key ? (For example a second emailaddres as trusted) ?
