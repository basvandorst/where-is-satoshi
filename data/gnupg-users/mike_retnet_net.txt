@_subject: Create a Key using a script? 
Is there a way to create a key by passing a list of information to gpg? What I
am trying to do is make it easy for our customers to create a key. I want to
have a web form where they fill in the information, I submit it to gpg, I save
the key on a keyring, and let them know what to do next. Is this possible? I
have a Windows and a Linux platform from which this can be done if that is
Any help, suggestions, comments are welcome. Thanks.

I don't seem to have that document. I have the manual.pdf, howto.rtf, and
intro.pdf. Where can I get that file?

It is part of the distribution.  If you can't find it in the materials you
have, just download the latest release.  It's in the doc/ directory.

@_subject: PHP Script to Send Key to Keyserver 
Thanks to a couple of people here, I now have an HTML and PHP script interface
to create a key. I was looking at installing my own keyserver but have decided
that sending the key to a public keyserver would be better for many reasons.
Now I am trying to find a PHP script that will send the key to
 and/or wwwkeys.pgp.net. Does anyone know of an existing PHP
script that I couldmodify to met the needs of this company? I appreciate any
help, suggestions, comments on sending a key to a keyserver.
Again thanks for past help and for assistance with this phase of making a
digital signature accessible.

@_subject: Return Codes 
When I execute from a PHP script
$output_array = array();
$returncode = 100;
$output = exec("E:\\newfromrn_dev\\pgp\\gpg.exe ".$parms, &$output_array,
The return code is 2. Is there a place to find what that rc is equal to? The
output_array is empty as well as $output.  Any suggestions where I am going
When I execute from the command line
R:\newfromrn_dev\pgp>gpg --batch --options .\gpg.conf --gen-key
gpg: Key data being read.
gpg: Your Name is MichaelAvila
gpg: Your EMail Address is mike
gpg: Key data reading completed.
gpg: Key Generation starting.
gpg: writing public key to `mike
gpg: writing secret key to `mike
gpg: writing self signature
gpg: DSA/SHA1 signature from: "311B49EC [?]"
gpg: writing self signature
gpg: DSA/SHA1 signature from: "311B49EC [?]"
gpg: writing key binding signature
gpg: DSA/SHA1 signature from: "311B49EC [?]"
gpg: writing key binding signature
gpg: DSA/SHA1 signature from: "311B49EC [?]"
It works!
All help, suggestions, comments are appreciated.
