        Hi all:
        That should be (for example):
  -rwsr-xr-x    1 root     root       614460 Jul 13 12:27 /usr/bin/gpg*
        Greetings.

Hash: SHA1
        Hi:
        I am using the keyserver pgp.rediris.es (Spain), and then, it
propagates its changes to the keyserver.net network.
        Hope this helps.

        Hi, Nick:
        First of all, you should find where is gpg installed: "whereis
        Then, you have to check that gpg's owner is root: "ls -l
        After that, just type: "chmod 4755 /path/to/gpg"
        Hope this helps.
        Greetings.
