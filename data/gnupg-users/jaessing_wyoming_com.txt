ah, If the email is confidential then by all means use gpg to encrypt it for the intended recipient(s) and skip the notice.

I am using enigmail (enigmail.mozdev.org) as an encryption plugin for mozilla (works with moz 0.9.6) and it works reasonably well for simply signing and encrypting text emails.

the redirect output ( > ) is a function of the windows shell. it takes the out put from the command on the left of the > and sends it to a file named on the right. to use it you will not want to use the -o or --output command associated with gpg. just issue the command as you would to get output to the screen then append something like  >myfile.gpg to the end of the command line.

I have had to do this for a projet i was working on as well. the problem is that the preferences are hardcoded in the keygen.c file (there is some reference to this in one of the faq you will need to change the preferences in the function keygen_add_std_prefs then recompile then generate a new key with the new executable (maybe simply editing the existing key with the new executable will change the prefs, I can't remember). I do keep this executable separate from my fully functional executable however so that I don't mistakenly create crippled keys when I don't intend to.
at any rate the part you are looking for looks like this:
           buf[0] = CIPHER_ALGO_RIJNDAEL;
           buf[1] = CIPHER_ALGO_TWOFISH;
           buf[2] = CIPHER_ALGO_CAST5;
           buf[3] = CIPHER_ALGO_BLOWFISH;
                build_sig_subpkt( sig, SIGSUBPKT_PREF_SYM, buf, 4 );
you probably want to change it to something like this to remove twofish:
           buf[0] = CIPHER_ALGO_RIJNDAEL;
           buf[1] = CIPHER_ALGO_CAST5;
           buf[2] = CIPHER_ALGO_BLOWFISH;
                build_sig_subpkt( sig, SIGSUBPKT_PREF_SYM, buf, 3 );
I think, however, there was some talk of adding a way to change the preferences from gpg without having to recompile and recreate the key? Werner?
