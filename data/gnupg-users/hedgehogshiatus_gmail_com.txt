I'm not a C/C++ guru so would appreciate anyone indicating if the
following is a bug in the generated gpg-error.h file.
This issue arose in the process of trying to create a ruby interface for gpgme.
After checking out the source for libgpg-error-1.7 and running:
./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
I run swig on an interface file that includes the generated gpg-error.h file.
I get the following error from swig (ver 1.3.36):
libgpg-error-1.7/src/gpg-error.h:346: Error: Syntax error in input(1).
lines 345-7 in gpg-error.h are:
    /* The following error codes are used to map system errors.  */
 GPG_ERR_SYSTEM_ERROR	(1 << 15)
    GPG_ERR_E2BIG = GPG_ERR_SYSTEM_ERROR | 0,
It is not clear to me if this is an problem with gpg-error.h or swig.
Appreciate any insight.

Thank-you for the suggestion.
Unfortunately cpp produced some code that `swig -ruby` choked on.
A workaround was to generate xml output from `swig -c++` and process
this xml file.
Thanks again

Correct. But do you claim the ideas are shenanigans:
a) use several words.
b) choose memorable combinations, to you, of these words.
Example: What do you make the _expected_ secure time _estimate_ of:
a) three four letter words say: muck, ruck, puck?
b) make them memorable: the puck in the ruck in the muck?
Then, for a), what is the estimate if one choose three five letter
words, or three six letter words?
Best wishes.

OK, but to my mind 'this is fun' is an example of the idea.  But we
differ on definition of idea, so it is likely won't agree on whether
the '2,500 years' is a incorrect illustration of an idea or an
incorrect idea :)
I'd be interested in the result that comes from the same assumptions
you just used to refute his calculations. That is those that gave you
the result 'equals ten seconds to break it -- not the 3 minutes he
I am genuinely interested in _roughly_ how much 'expected secure time'
the phrase 'the puck in the ruck in the muck' (eight words) would buy
you over some random 8 letter string.
Don't go overboard on 'the Science'.  Twenty minutes with someone
'suitable' - maybe even your high school student - and a $5 budget for
a hammer and they _will_ have your passphrase/password, or your life.
Best wishes

I think the point of the blog post was to point out (not for the first
time), that the real trick is to make it easier, to make it costly for
the squeemish ;)
Best wishes
