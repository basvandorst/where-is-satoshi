@_subject: OpenPGP Card - general error unblocking PIN 
Hi list,
I've been giving the OpenPGP card a try, and a ran into a problem when
changing/unblocking my PIN.
After a few Google searches I noticed other people also experienced this
problem, however, I couldn't find a solution.
GnuPG is version 1.4.9 and I'm using the second version of the card. I've included the debug information of the passwd > unblock PIN
command, even though the Change PIN doesn't work either:

One thing I also noticed is that the PIN retry counter has the
following values: 3 0 3
According to the documentation, the first value and second should be in
Any tips would be appreciated. Thank you very much for any help.

Thank you very much for getting back to me. In fact, upgrading to the
latest stable fixed the problems I was experiencing. Thank you very much for the help.

For keys that I require access in more than 1 computer, I usually have
the keys stored on the OpenPGP card.
I keep it on my wallet and a backup of the keys, done every once in a
while, in a encrypted removable drive. I don't use it on my phone, though.

If it uses GnuPG, then it will respect the rules set by your keyring
preferences. You can check the preferences with the command:
gpg --edit-key 0xYOURID
(if you don't know your ID, use gpg --list-secret-keys)
It will list what are the preferred ciphers, algorithms for integrity
and compression.
If you want to change it, and use something else, you
can use the following command to see the supported values:
gpg --verbose --version
After that, you can change your preferences. Edit your key again:
gpg --edit-key 0xYOURID
and now use the 'setpref' option, respecting the values you got from
gpg --verbose --version command.
For example:
setpref S9 S8 S7 S3 H10 H9 H8 H11 Z3 Z2 Z1 Z0
will configure a UID (these preferences are UID-based) to use: Cipher: AES256, AES192, AES, CAST5, 3DES
Digest: SHA512, SHA384, SHA256, SHA224, SHA1
Compression: BZIP2, ZLIB, ZIP, Uncompressed
Hope this makes it easier for you to understand and edit to suit your
needs. I think I didn't miss anything, but feel free to correct me :)
Happy new year list!

My bad for sending the last e-mail. While those settings apply to
hybrid systems, I don't know if this application generates a keyring,
and therefor, those instructions are not very helpful.

Indeed Robert. Thanks for pointing that out.
I only noticed that certs were not even being used _after_ sending the
message on how to edit their preferences.

Hi Mike,
$ gpg --verbose --version
will tell you (after the cipher/algorithm and between ()) what is the
short code to use with setpref. Example for Cipher:
3DES (S2), CAST5 (S3), BLOWFISH (S4), AES (S7), AES192 (S8), AES256 (S9)
I might have misunderstood your question, so feel free to let me know
if you need something else.

@_subject: WARNING: digest algorithm MD5 is deprecated 
Hi everyone,
After a few searches I decided to ask the list if they can provide some
help on this matter.
While refreshing the keys, I get the warning mentioned on the subject
while updating my own public key.
My preferences are set to SHA512, SHA384, SHA256, SHA224, SHA1 or H10 H9
H8 H11, so I don't understand why it's complaining about MD5.
I'm most certainly am missing something, and I would appreciate any
Thank you.

Hi Daniel,
Thanks for getting back to me. Here is a report of what I done:
$ gpg --refresh-keys
gpg: refreshing 37 keys from hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net
gpg: key B9466FB4: "Tiago Faria " not changed
gpg: WARNING: digest algorithm MD5 is deprecated
Hope this is enough, if not I'll send the full transcript as soon as I
get home.
Thank you.
