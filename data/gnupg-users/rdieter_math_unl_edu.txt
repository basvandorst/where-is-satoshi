Anyone else seeing this with gnupg2-1.9.18:
gpgkey2ssh: gpgkey2ssh.c:255: main: Assertion `argc == 2' failed.
Does the same on all platforms I've built for, including RedHat 9, Fedora Core 4, RedHat Enterprise 4.

@_subject: libksba > 0.9.11 + gnupg-1.9.19 'make check' failures on x86_64 
Here's a copy of what I recently sent to the -devel list... in case someone here can help or has comment.
I've been trying to build gnupg-1.9.19 on Fedora Core 3/4 x86_64, but
'make check' always fails (because gpgsm segfaults)... relavent section
of the build.log appended below.
i386 and ppc builds and checks fine.  On x86_64, gnupg-1.9.19 hacked to
build against libksba-0.9.11 builds and checks fine too.
Full build.log available at:

@_subject: dirmngr info patch 
Here's a patch to dirmngr's .info file so that one can cleanly remove it from %_infodir/dir.
