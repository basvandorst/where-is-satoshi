@_subject: how to find the keygrip of a key 
Hi all,
I have a gpg key that I would like to add to gpg-agent using the
gpg-preset-passphrase. I understand that gpg-preset-passphrase expects
me to provide the keygrip the key but I cannot see how to find it. The
key is an ordinary gpg key, nothing to do with gpgsm. Any help would
be appreciated.
