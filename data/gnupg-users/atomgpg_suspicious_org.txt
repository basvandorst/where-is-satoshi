@_subject: making it easy to find keys 
aside from key-servers, i've noticed that quite a few people have their
keys available from their own web site and commonly referenced by a link
on a web site, email signature, or email headers.
in the absence of standards (that i'm aware of) i'm wondering if there's
any consensus, or at least any good reasons for or against, presenting the
public key information in particular formats....
assuming that a public key is armored, should the file suffix be ".txt" or
".asc"? i've seen both used, and i think i've seen a few people use a
".pgp" or ".gpg" suffix.
should the file name be pgp? gpg? pgp-key? gpg-key? open-pgp-key? i can't
even count how many different file-names i've seen people use.
as non-standard as that is, there seems to be even less consistency among
people who reference their keys in their SMTP headers (like i've done).
after the "X-", i don't know if i've seen any two people use the same
i know, there's no "right way" or "wrong way" to present this information
to the world, and any variation on this theme (within reason) should work
fine, but i'm sure there are some good reasons out there for doing or not
doing things in a particular way. lacking a standard, i'd at least like to
hear some of those good reasons people have....

yeah, that's my real name...
i was thinking along the same lines, for ideological reasons. i'm leaning
towards "OpenPGP" (or "Open-PGP"). as much as i happen to be partial
towards a particular implementation (GnuPG), the goal should be
compatibility and communication, *not* some subtle (and confusing, to
some) attempt to be a cheerleader for a particular implementation.

@_subject: RSA key size restriction? 
i don't think anyone can guarantee that. advances in number theory and/or
computer power could take a quantum leap that leaves any or all of these
algorithms, with any size keys, trivial to break. it's only based on our
current understanding of these things that we can ~speculate~ that the
security based in these algorithms will be secure when we wake up the next
assuming that the technology progresses at predictable rates (no comments
on that assumption!) then it would be reasonable to say that larger keys
will "probably" be secure for a longer time.... as a practical issue, we
have to balance our level of paranoia with our speculation of how fast
that technology will evolve, and how long our secrets need to stay secret.
i'll second that... the expert option does allow things that are not
considered either smart or reasonable to be done, so this should be added
on the grounds that it's probably not reasonable (for most of us!) but
some people would seem to be more comfortable with it.

@_subject: proper key types 
using GPG to encrypt email from a PHP form forces me to set some liberal*
permissions to the keyring.
* liberal should not be confused with insane... the permissions and
ownerships are what they have to be; that keyring is not shared with
"real" users, and the secret key is kept far from the server. nonetheless,
for the web server to use the key, the web server needs to access the
keyring, and a compromised web server could compromise the keyring.
my understanding of ElGamal encryption is that if the same value of "k" is
used more than once, you're hosed. i don't entirely understand how the
"random_seed" file is used and updated, but my concern is if it's possible
that an attacker might manipulate that file (or some other component of
the keyring) that would cause "k" to repeat.
in such a case, would it be prudent to use an RSA encryption sub-key? or
would i still have a good (enough) chance of producing unique "k"s even if
the "random_seed" file is compromised?

share a single symmetric session-key, which is asymmetrically encrypted
using each of their public keys.... (as i understand it)
if one of those recipients wanted to crack the private key of one of the

that facilitate a known plain-text attack? does it matter which asymmetric

are the algorithms vulnerable to this? does the implementation makes this
attack unlikely?

umask takes away permissions (such as taking away other users' ability to
read files) but cannot be used to add permissions (such as turning on an
execute bit).
depending on your shell and/or flavor of *nix, you might be able to create
an empty file by `touch`ing it, then chmod it, then redirect stuff into
it. the point is to set the restrictive permissions before filling the
file with data.
if you can't create a file by touching it, you can always do:
  echo > new_file
  chmod 700 new_file
  echo "${good_stuff}" > new_file

ok, the default setting for generating a new key-pair is:
   (1) DSA and ElGamal (default)
re-reading the DSA section in applied cryptography, i was wondering about
using a master key that can be made bigger than DSA's limit of 1K.
then of course, i started playing (to see if it could be done without a
fight) with both RSA and ElGamal sub-keys (for encryption).
here's the keyring that i generated:
pub  2048R/D8E2A23F 2003-11-03 testing (testing RSA master key) sub  4096g/86EE3F36 2003-11-03
sub  4096R/83F2C8E8 2003-11-03
note: on freeBSD 4.8, gpg 1.2.3, 1.2G Duron, with `rndcontrol` well
seeded, the keys took less than 2 minutes each to cook.
anyway, i have 2 questions:
1) would a 2K (or larger) RSA master-key cost me anything in terms of
2) given the current state of crypto research, is it considered
before someone asks me what color my tin-foil hat is, i fully understand
that this is far beyond practical applications, and of interest only for
either academic or clinically paranoid ends... i like to think i fall into
the former category  ;)
any other thoughts on ~not~ using the defaults for generating new keys?

disclaimer - i'm still new to this [pgp/gpg] and not yet an expert, but

question a shot....
do you want to generate a key that uses a single RSA key for both
encryption and signing?
how about:
and select 7... is that what you're trying to do?
of course, IIRC, PGP-2 specifies IDEA as the (only?) cipher, while openPGP
specifies that 3DES ~MUST~ be supported (among a choice of other ciphers).
there's a similar issue with SHA-1 v MD5. depending on exactly what you're
trying to do, you might have to generate a key-pair, then "key-edit" the
preferences to exclude SHA, 3DES, etc, not to mention that you'd have to
use gnupg-idea for IDEA support.

you can also revoke your old key with a note that it's been superseded

2) depending on why your creating a new key, it might be an option to

@_subject: Migrating keys 
if an attacker had both 1) access to person's email account and 2) that
person's secret key, then, why would they need to raise suspicion by
issuing a new key? the old one should work fine, unless the target has
maintained a revocation certificate AND knows that their account and/or
key have been compromised AND issues that certificate to everyone who WILL
(this is future tense!) send them mail.
speaking of not watertight, here's a problem (based on my understanding of
PGP/GPG, correct me if i'm wrong): let's say i've known bob my whole life,
and i sign has key (0x13). i've now personally certified that his key is
really *HIS* key, right?
now, what happens if bob generates a new [encryption] sub-key? well, that
sub-key comes into this world with my signature attached to it and
authenticating it's validity (because the sub-key is self-signed with the
same signing key that i've signed).
in the same way, if bob (or his secret-key) is taken by aliens (or the the
mob, MIB, etc), and *THEY* can also generate a new [encryption] sub-key,
then that new encryption key also bears my signature (but is *NOT* really
bob's key!).
so ultimately, if an attacker can hijack someones secret keyring (or just
the secret-signing-key), they wouldn't need to raise any red flags by
instructing people to use a new key-pair, they could just expire the old
sub-key, and generate a new one, which happens to include a bunch of
signatures (maybe even mine!). of course it's probably easier for an
attacker to steal the secret keyring than to (mathematically) recover it
however, this attack only requires that the signing key is compromised....
this is important because we're mostly using 1024 (DSA) signing keys, even
though [most of] our encryption keys are larger.
moral of the story? if bob is abducted by aliens (or the mob, MIB, etc),
and they have enough computing power to recover his secret-signing-key,
but not enough computing power to recover his secret-encryption-key, this
would be a pretty cool attack, and they could pretend to be bob without
raising too much (if any) suspicion.
another observation, is that a signed email [claiming to be] from bob
(even though many of us would not trust it, at face value) really has just
as much validity as a new sub-key (which most of us would trust, at face
value) because both are signed by bob's signing key, which we trust (and
may have certified to trust) belongs to bob.... social aspects aside, is
there really a technical difference between trusting a new sub-key and
trusting a signed email, like above? (i propose there is no difference)

in one case (based on a signed email) one might (or might not) explicitly
sign a new key... in the other case (a new sub-key is generated) one has
implicitly (and unknowingly) signed the new sub-key.
anyway, it does kinda make sense that a trust model should devalue
signatures as they get older....

yes. the encryption key isn't signed by other people, just the signing
i knew this would get confusing....
let's see... bob has his key signed by alice. i know alice, and i trust
her signature on bob's key. then bob goes and get's abducted by aliens (or
the mob, MIB, etc) and they have enough computing power to recover his
1024 signing key, but not his 2048 encryption key. (or, maybe bob was just
using one of the faulty ElGamal keys as a primary key?)
now, the aliens (or the mob, MIB, etc) set their computer's clock to some
time *before* alice's signature (setting the time to the past is optional,
but may be useful in some circumstances). then they generate a new
encryption sub-key and (self) sign it with bob's signing key, pretending
to be bob. if they set their clock back, it would appear that the new
sub-key was known to alice (who i trust). even if they don't set their
clock back, it would seem that bob (who i don't know, but i trust alice's
signature on his key)  has just generated a new sub-key. none of this
raises any alarm, even though bob could be getting probed by aliens, or
having his bones bleached by the sun.
that key can then be passed off as bob's key, even though it isn't. it
would also appear to be signed by alice (who i trust) although it wasn't.

i'm not trying to say that signing someone else's key is a certification
that their sub-key(s) are authentic (i'm actually trying to point out
where that common assumption breaks down), but it's generally considered
to be the case, and the current trust model doesn't complain when that
assumption is made.... in fact, the current trust model helps people feel
comfortable making that [false] assumption.
although a 3rd party signature really does bear no relationship to the sub
key(s), most of us consider it convenient to think that it does.
btw, is there a (simple) way to certify (or have certified) a sub-key, by
a 3rd party?
i can think of a few ways that are not so simple...

the confusion continues.... i think that most users, esp new users, to
PGP/GPG don't understand that alice's signature on bob's key is *ONLY*
vouching for bob's signing key, *NOT* bob's encryption key(s). i think
most users, and especially most new users, don't really understand about
it's not that i'm complaining about the system, rather, i'm complaining
about how the system fits into the way people *think* the system works. i
would expect that most people _on_this_list_ know more about the system
than the general public, and i'm basing many of my assumptions on the way
that [i think] the general public looks at this system.
the two questions that remain are:
 1) is there a way to not only trust, but verify someone's sub-key?
is there an easy and/or standardized way for bob to meet with alice and
allow them both to verify each other's sub-keys? they can do this for
their signing keys by exchanging and confirming their key types, sizes and
fingerprints, but i don't know of any application that generates
fingerprints of sub-keys.
 2) if we trust that bob's signing key has not been compromised, is there
a difference between accepting a new key because bob adds a new sub-key to
his public-key; and accepting a new key because bob sent a signed email
that instructs us to do so. in both cases, bob's old key (that we trust)
has signed his new key (which we might not trust, yet). how do i know that
the new key bob generated is the same new key that i think is his new key?
if bob's signing key has been compromised, i could have a new key "from
bob" that's not the same key that bob generated. is this type of attack
likely? i really don't think so, but the question remains.... is there a
(quick, easy and painless) way that me and bob can be sure that we're both
talking about the same sub-key?
looking at rfc 2440 (11.2) it looks like an application should be able to
generate fingerprints for sub-keys. for some applications, it's good
enough enough to trust... other times things should be verified.

@_subject: newbie question about identities 
i'm only a few years behind with gpg/pgp, but trying to get up to
i like the idea of identities, but i'm not sure if i'm either missing
something, or if that part of the system (or documentation) is flawed....
let's say i have 2 identities....
        employee
         radical
obviously, each of these identities should be kept *FAR* apart.
according to the documentation [that i've found], all you have to do is
use the gpg "edit-key" and "adduid" to add an ID to your key-pair, and
then you can use one key-pair for multiple IDs.
i see 2 problems with this:
1) the key-id is the same for both roles
2) when exporting the public key, both identities are part of it
both of these factors make it too easy for one's "other" identity to be
revealed... this could be bad (very bad, since keys are like viruses,
and can't be removed from circulation).
so the question is, am i missing something? or is this a fact of life if a
single key-pair is used for multiple IDs? if one wants to use multiple
IDs (and keep each ID isolated from all other IDs), is it necessary that
each ID has it's own key-pair?

@_subject: newbie question about identities 
yeah... i figured out that part... the question is whether or not that's
the proper (or only) way to keep separate identities isolated from each
other, or if there's another way.
according to [my understanding of] the documentation, it says that you can
have multiple identities sharing a key-pair (which is correct), and it
seems to imply that that those identities are isolated from each other
(which seems to be incorrect).
i guess i'm trying to clarify whether the problem is in the
implementation, the documentation, or just my understanding of it... it
seems like the handbook is advocating something that's not quite right,
and i'm trying to figure out which way(s) are right. i'm also trying to
verify that the documentation is either incorrect or misleading.

@_subject: newbie question about identities 
that's the part in the handbook that seems to imply that it's OK to just
add an identity to an existing key-pair, and everything will work out fine.
as i'm having my suspicions confirmed by the responses, that is not quite
fine when identities have to be hidden from each other, although it is
fine if the identities do not (socially) conflict with each other.
maybe illustrating the concept of multiple UIDs (with one key-pair) using
an employee and an activist is the problem...
i think there should be some explicit mention in the handbook that any
identities sharing a key-pair can easily be associated with each other,
and if two (or more) identities have to remain isolated from each other
they MUST NOT share a key-pair. in the current version of the manual (1.1)
i don't see anything that explains that, but the example of the
employee/activist really seems misleading....

@_author: Atom 'Smasher' 
@_subject: newbie question about identities 
you raise a good point, but for this thread the concern is whether or not
either identity can be deduced using a shared key-pair (which it can,
although the handbook seems misleading on the subject), and what is the
simplest way to avoid that (which seems to be that each identity has it's
own key-pair).
both identities may have a need for trusted (aka, not anonymous) secure
email.... it's not that one party needs anonymity, it's really that both
IDs have to remain isolated from each other.... obviously, if both IDs are
sending mail from the same account on a server, that would be a way to
determine that they belong to the same person... there are many places
where a person can screw up, but i'm trying to find out how much of that
rests in the keys...
i agree that the documentation is lacking in all areas of anonymity, but
that's not what i'm going after, here. there are many steps beyond the
scope of this thread for keeping one (or more) identities anonymous.

does anyone know if there's (yet) any way to use opie or s/key to unlock

@_subject: opie or s/key with gpg? (fwd) 
it might not require that the secret pgp key be stored in the clear, with
access to it controlled by "something else"....
i'm not any good when it comes to C (yet!), so i'm not the one to write
any proof-of-concept code, but here's how it could work on any machine
that you'd trust "enough" to type your password into in the first place...
i wish i could do more oversimplifying here, but i'm sure that'll just
confuse things...
based on the secret-keyring, an opie-secret-keyring is generated (when
setting an opie password). when a password is entered (into gpg), to
unlock the secret pgp key, it's first checked to see if it's the valid
reusable password, and if it isn't then it's checked if it's an opie
the fun part is how to keep the opie-secret-keyring safe....
remember, this is an oversimplification, so don't flame me if something
isn't quite right....
let's say we have the count at 123, the password="p", the seed="s", so the
opie-secret-keyring is symmetrically encrypted, with a password based on
the final hash value of opie(p,s,124).
so, after a successful OTP is given to [an opie version of] gpg, let's
decrypt the secret key (from the opie-secret-keyring) so it's available to
gpg to do it's thing, and then re-encrypt the opie-secret-keyring, this
time with a password based on opie(p,s,123) (the current OTP). the next
valid OTP is in other words, the opie-secret-keyring is symmetrically encrypted, using
a password which is based on the final hash value of opie as it's
password. every time the opie-secret-keyring is accessed, the file is
decrypted (otherwise the key can't be accessed), then re-encrypted with
it's new password based on the final hash value of opie.
now the opie-secret-keyring is encrypted with a password based on
opie(p,s,123), and entering the right opie-password (based on a count of
122) will decrypt it, make the key available, and then re-encrypt it with
a password based on the final hash of opie(p,s,122). the opie counter is
now at 121.
** weakness below **
this should work. of course other concerns would be the security of the
computer, including any media that the file is stored on, or accessible
to, but that's a matter of implementation, not protocol... and since these
concerns already apply to the current implementations, i don't think
there's much of a drawback.
all in all, i would think that if this were reasonably implemented, it
would be at least as secure as a reusable password. maybe this would be
even better.... in a case were my keyring is generated and maintained on a
local machine (trusted to be secure), i could then copy an
opie-secret-keyring to a server that i use to read/send mail, and not have
to worry about my keystrokes being logged. (i know; if my keystrokes are
logged, then *they* know what i'm writing before it gets encrypted, but
they won't get my key - it makes a PART of the system more secure, it
doesn't make the whole system more secure.)
in some environments, this could eliminate what is currently the weakest
link in the practical use of pgp.
** weakness **
if an attacker gets a copy of the opie-secret-keyring, and sniffs any OTP
that's newer than the file, that sniffed OTP can be used to generate
previously used OTPs (which can unlock the file). this requires that the
opie secret password and string are the same, both the time that the file
is stolen, and the time that the password is sniffed. however, if an
attacker has access to both the opie-secret-keyring AND your password,
then you're hosed anyway. this method DOES NOT protect you in the event
that your opie-secret-keyring can be read by an attacker; it ONLY protects
your password from being replayed. of course, i'm not sure how useful the
password would ever be, without a copy of the encrypted secret keyring, so
maybe the whole thing makes no sense.... maybe all of this rambling is
pointless anyway?
it's 0035h here... i'll stop rambling, and start wasting some thought
cycles on how to use something like opie to keep files safe....

in the current form of opie and s/key, i agree... in order for an OTP
mechanism to be helpful in protecting a file, the "standard" opie system
would have to be modified, so even if an attacker had OTP x, it could not
be used to determine OTP x+n (or OTP x-n !!!).
not at all intuitive... the knee-jerk reaction is probably to say that it

bear in mind that opie & s/key are (together) just one particular protocol
for generating one-time-passwords. there are other methods, but most are
impractical, for a variety of reasons. i think that ~if~ it is possible to
do something like this, it would probably have to be a different protocol.

@_author: Atom 'Smasher' 
@_subject: opie or s/key with gpg? (fwd) 
forgive me for thinking out loud, but this might do the trick....
like opie and s/key, we have a secret password, a seed, and a count, which
are used to generate a one time password.
unlike opie and s/key, the secret password must be known to both the
calculator and the machine receiving the OTP (the remote machine keeps
it's copy encrypted).
using password="p", seed="s"  and count="c", we use f(p,s,c). instead of
just performing "c" number of iterations on "p,s" (like opie & s/key),
let's also throw "c" into the mixer, so we're performing "c" number of
iterations on "p,s,c". (this is probably much more work than necessary,
but is that really a problem?)
we can use the final result of that function (or a function of it) as a
password in a symmetric algorithm to decrypt a file, and if the secret
password is contained in that [encrypted] file, then the file can be
re-encrypted using that password and the next sequence number (and the
seed) to determine the next symmetric password in the sequence.
such an algorithm would render it infeasible to use a sniffed OTP to
determine any previously used OTP. a sniffed password can still be used to
decrypt a stolen keyring, but there is a narrow window in which the
keyring must be stolen and the password sniffed.... if Mallory steals
Bob's keyring just after Bob accesses it with count=123, then a sniffed
password will only be useful to Mallory if it's sniffed while count=122.
not perfect, but better than reusable passwords.
i guess that any encrypted file can be had by an attacker if it's stolen
immediately before the password is sniffed.... i really doubt if there's a
way around that. i'm sure there are other ways to accomplish this type of
an OTP system, but i think they'd all be vulnerable to that type attack.
of course, to create an OTP keyring like this, the OTP secret password
must be supplied to both the calculator and the machine creating the file
(so the secret password can be stored in the encrypted file). one of the
neat things about opie is that the password never has to leave the
calculator... oh-well.. if anyone thinks of a way to do it, so the secret
password is only known to the calculator, i'd be curious...

@_subject: Best practices for multiple e-mail addresses 
i'm kinda new to the list myself, but since i've been so vocal about this
type of thing i'll take a shot at answering you...
if you add multiple IDs to a key pair, then each ID "points" to each other
ID. this shouldn't be a problem as long as you don't mind that anyone who
knows you from work also know you from your other business.
on the other hand, if your employer doesn't want you to have you
conducting other business on the side (or the type of side-business is not
acceptable to the primary employer), then those two IDs should each have
their own key pair. of course there are other methods of discovering that
two email addresses belong to the same person, but those are (mostly)
beyond the scope of pgp/gpg.
basically, adding IDs to a key is a convenience, while creating new keys
for each ID helps to keep those IDs unrelated to each other.
this is one of the practical aspects of pgp/gpg where the right choice
depends more on social issues than technical issues.

similar for "--export-secret-keys" and "--export-secret-subkeys".

can then delete the keys (either through malice or accident), a secure

salaries, it's simply not reasonable to expect the remaining work force to
pick up all of the slack, always for no raise in pay. FACT: productivity
*WILL* drop... let them waste money on efficiency experts who can put that
into a graph.
they want to fire someone who knows how to do a job, and then transfer
that responsibility to someone at the bottom of the totem pole? RTFM on
company time... THAT'S the cost of doing business...

@_subject: Options to revoke a key 
although, if you remember pieces of it, then you do (in theory) have an
advantage over anyone else who might try to brute-force it.... with the
pieces that you know, and some programming, it still may not be feasible
to crack your own password.
something else of relevance, that i found in the man page, is:
i haven't played with them, but they may be worth looking into if one has
a trusted friend/partner who is less likely than oneself to lose the keys.
idea... (sorry, i'm thinking out loud, again) what if bob generates a
revocation certificate, and uses gpg to encrypt a copy of it for alice
(using alice's public key), and then encrypts that copy for carol (using
carol's public key). then bob sends that double-encrypted copy to carol,
with instructions to both carol and alice... neither carol nor alice could
decrypt the certificate unless they both work together, which presumably
they'd do only at bob's request to recover the revocation certificate.
of course, if you have a place that's [electronically, physically and/or
socially] secure enough to store a revocation certificate, then you should
consider if it's also secure enough to store a copy of your pass-phrase.
conventional wisdom says you should never write down a password, but with
reasonable precautions it might be better to have a copy you can get to.
check out the password links (towards the bottom) that i've collected at -
also, an expiration date on keys let's them die on their own if they're
not maintained... i'm keeping my keys good for 12-24 months at a time...
when the expiration date hits 12 months, i'll add another 12 months to
them. i figure it's easier to update (or force people to update) a key
that expires at a later date, than an earlier date.

@_subject: safe places to store a password 
ok, not everyone can remember "strong" passwords like:
esp when they're not used several times a a day.
so, here's a (probably incomplete) list of apps that could help. of
course, if you're storing a bunch of passwords in one of these, and you
forget the master password, you're hosed.
palm OS
a non OS dependent solution could be storing your password(s),
electronically or printed, in a safe-deposit box or a safe. remember, any
"safe" that can be carried away is not secure ;)
it's suggested that a "real" safe should be at least 600 lbs (275 Kg)
and/or be bolted to a concrete floor... otherwise it's too easy for an
attacker to carry the safe away and crack it at their leisure. and then
there's the locking mechanism of the safe...

@_subject: Options to revoke a key 
sorry about that...
all i'm saying is that (hypothetically) someone who knows that a password
starts with a lowercase "abc", ends with a capital "XYZ", and has a total
of 8 alpha-numeric characters, then they should be able break the password
*MUCH* faster than someone who does not have that much information...
they've just reduced the size of the attack from unknown, to 62^2, or just
under 12 bits of attack space.
on the other hand, if one party knows that the password contains the
string "abc", that doesn't really help much... the password could be
"abc123", or it could be "!5mZR?abc+dHu3RfEz"
depending on how much information is known about the password, and how
well that information can be applied to the problem via a cracking
program, the information could significantly reduce the size of the
password space... instead of a password that has a 0.5 chance of being
cracked before the earth crashes into the sun, an attacker may have a 0.5
chance of cracking it before dinner (in this context, an attacker may be
the legitimate owner of the password).

a proper cracking app will bypass gpg, and work directly with your keyring
(or an exported key?). after you crack it, you can then access it, so a
revocation may not be necessary, if you choose to just write down and/or
change the password.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

it's still based on the x509 PKI (trust us: single point of failure),
which i don't like as much as the openPGP PKI (web of trust: tunable to
the paranoia and needs of the end user).
it doesn't seem hard (in theory) to implement a (user-friendly!) openPGP
type of PKI into web browsers... one could import PGP keys into their
browser (or just leave the default verisign/thawte/etc keys), assign
levels of trust to those keys, and assuming that the user-defined (or
default) trust settings are met, everything proceeds as normal... except
of course that one's PGP key could be used to sign a web site's
certificate and "trust" doesn't have to be issued from a central point.
really, it could be done in a way that's invisible to the 99% of end users
who don't know or care about crypto/keys/certs (like it is now), but could
open a lot of possibilities for people who want to hack around and
experiment, and not rely on a single point of failure.
of course, there'd still be a need for CAs: some web sites will still
prefer to buy their "trust" from a "trusted" source, rather than enter
into a "web" of trust (corporate mentality)... and those are the companies
that don't mind paying the verisign tax.

PGP/GPG will let you encrypt a message to any number of users at once.
last i checked, MIT-PGP (tm) had a feature that's sort of like a
key-escrow, so if someone leaves the company, email encrypted to them can
be decrypted with the "other" key. GnuPG doesn't support that, but in some
workplaces you can do almost the same thing by adding a "recipient" line
to a user's config file.
keys used by more than one individual person are almost always a bad idea,
but you'll really have to assess the security risks, concerns, threats,
etc to get a picture of what level of security you want/need and what
applications (PGP, symmetric encryption, file-system encryption, etc) will
help you get there.

you're the sender, i'm the recipient. as the sender of that message, see
if you can decrypt it... i'll be *very* impressed if you can.
my point, here, is that you can't always count on the sender encrypting to
themself. and what if the sender and recipient both get hit by a bus?
data can be ENcrypted on auto-pilot to as many keys as you want, and sent
to a file, database, etc....
one of the encryption keys could belong to the boss... they never plan on
getting hit by a bus. also, you might want to print out your private key,
write out your secret password on it, put it in an envelope, and store
that in a locked safe, under control of the boss. when all of the techs
get hit by a meteorite, the new techs can recover the keys from the safe.
that's tough.... i can't think of a way to do that. even if you could
"revoke" the key, let's say one of the employees emails the database to
himself, and then gets fired: he's home with a copy of the db and his
secret key.
the best thing i can think of (at 0400 hrs) to deal with that, is to have
a file/db encrypted to each employee. if an employee leaves, that file/db
can be deleted.... but it won't do any good to delete it if they already
saved their own copy  ;)

i would argue that it's less efficient, largely because there's a single
point of failure (the CA).
here's how i picture it:
let's say you connect to  and that certificate is
signed with my PGP key. if you have my key "installed" in your browser,
and marked as "trusted", then you get a secure connection. otherwise, you
get a pop-up box asking you if you'd like to accept, examine or discard
the certificate.
my understanding of SSL/TLS is that the client can authenticate the
server, but the server has no way to authenticate the client (via
in practice, i connect to  and i want to be VERY sure
that i'm connecting to the correct server. the server has no need to
authenticate that the key on my end ~really~ belongs to me... that's what
my login credentials (username/password) are for.

if me and you know and trust each other, we can sign each others keys
(after properly validating them).
from then on, if i download a key from a key-server that's signed by you,
i can reasonably assume that the key belongs to the person who claims to
own that key: if you download a key that's signed by me, you can
reasonably assume the same.
getting around that requires forging a signature, which is generally
considered to be infeasible.
type "web of trust" into your favorite search engine.
the only information they would get is an email address, user name,
comment, and *public* key information....
* email address: there has been no evidence of spammers harvesting email
from key servers. it might seem like a hot target, but it's really not.
in any case, install a spam filter.
* user name: this is (typically) the user name associated with that
address, so there are easier ways to find out that i'm "Atom Smasher".
* comment: this optional field can include anything you want, but some
common sense will tell you what not to put in it (like a password, or
social security number {in the US}).
* public key: a big part of public key cryptography depends on making the
public key widely available. if you can gain information about one's
private key by having access to their public key, we'd all like to know
about it.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
logic dictates that these statements can not both be correct:
* "No version of PGP before 8 can reliably handle v4 signatures."
* "PGP versions 5 through 7 only recognize v4 signatures on key material."
assuming that you [dave] are correct, then the man page must be wrong.
that seems like a slight (very slight!) deviation from the RFC (5.2):
obviously not a catastrophic deviation, but i didn't see it mentioned
anywhere... not even doc/gnupg/OpenPGP.
i would think that the same thing could be accomplished in a more
RFC-compliant (and easier to figure out) way by making the default
behavior to use v4 signatures, but including "force-v3-sigs" in the
default config file. (IMHO) that would keep the application closer to the
RFC ideal, but in practice it would still be compatible with older
versions of PGP(tm).
if there are only a few yes/no options that default "yes", then i'd like
to request that the man page specify that those options (that you list
above) default to "yes", while all of the other yes/no options default to
"no". or... each yes/no option should explicitly state (in the man page)
what it defaults to, and if it's overridden in the default config file.
the default config file would also be a good place to explain why a
default would be overridden, as with the case of why v3 signatures are

ok... i may be slow, but i'm catching on.... ;)
so, there is an IETF name space and a user name space. any name that

how am i doing so far?
now, since the IETF hasn't defined anything to be used in their name
space, that leaves the user name space, which should (must?) be in the

is there a way to pipe data through gpg and retain information that's
above and/or below the pgp-header info?
normally, if that message is piped into gpg, the only output (on STDOUT)
would be the "signed data". i also know all of the reasons why it would
normally be sensible to strip out the "abc data" and "xyz data".
i do have an application in mind that would require data that's outside of
the signed data area to be passed through gpg, but i'm not sure if gpg can
do that. any ideas?

what are the (dis)advantages of pgp/mime vs in-line pgp?
of course, pgp/mime is an *official* standard, while in-line pgp is an
*unofficial* standard. why isn't in-line pgp *officially* recognized as an
email standard?
two reasons i like in-line pgp:
* i've only heard of one MUA that chokes on in-line pgp, but plenty of
MUAs can't handle pgp/mime.
* i've *never* had an in-line signature cause problems with someone's
poorly configured virus filter.
ok... a third reason that i like in-line pgp is because that's all i have
with pine.
disclaimer: yes, i've tried mutt a bunch of times... but i have pine set
up to do things that mutt can't emulate (no, really!).

i didn't realize that RFC 2440 made in-line pgp officially accepted as an
*email* standard... something about the body of an email must be plain
text... (what RFC is that...?)
as an official standard then, does mutt support it? i've heard that it
doesn't, which is one of the reasons that i was under the impression that
it's not an official standard.
it would be nice to sign/encrypt attachments all at once, but i can always
sign/encrypt them individually, before attaching them.

these seem like implementation problems of the MUA, more than problems
with the format...
if the raw message was piped into gpg, it would work fine, right? the
problem seem to come from a receiving MUA tries to be smart about
interpreting a message....
it sound slike the same problem of a message that's converted from text to
html before verification.

in a clearsigned email, lines can be longer than they should be... but an
inline encrypted email would have lines of interest no longer then 64
characters (excluding CR/NL) within the body of the email.
during decryption, the signature is checked as the message is being
decrypted, before the plain-text is output from gpg...
so if an MUA wraps text and tries to verify that (incorrectly) wrapped
text, the signature will fail.... but if an MUA decrypts a message, the
signature is verified before the text has a chance to wrap in the MUA.

you can add (or delete) as much white-space as you want at the ends of
lines, and that should NOT affect clearsigned signature creation or
you can test this by running:
  $ date | gpg --clearsign > test-file
then edit "test-file" to add spaces at the end of lines within the signed
data.... then:
  $ gpg --verify < test-file
should still say the signature is good.

"Also, any trailing whitespace (spaces, and tabs, 0x09) at the end of any
line is ignored when the cleartext signature is calculated."

exactly. i've been using pine for about 10 years... it's not a case of
"this is what i'm used to", it's really a case of "i've pushed this to the
limits of what it can do and nothing else can do it."
i emailed them to report my observations about the way pine handles
ssl/tls imap connections, and the response made it clear that they just
don't have a clue about security. not even a little bit.
i'd like to switch to a free (as in speech) MUA for ideological reasons.
and of course, everyone knows that mutt is ~better~.
i've tried mutt several times, and i'm willing to learn a new interface,
but it just can't do what i need. i've asked in the mutt mailing list &
usenet, but i'm told the problem (with colors) is in ncurses/slang, not
mutt. either way, mutt can't do what i need, and in the meantime pine can,
and for me the color support is necessary.
i keep checking back with mutt every few years, and when they get the
color support as good as pine has, i'm confident that i can either
configure everything else the way i need it or write my own hooks.

inline signatures don't ~break~ list footers, but since the footers exist
outside of the pgp headers, they tend to not be displayed after the
message is piped through gpg. at least that's the way pine handles it with
ez-pine-gpg and the other gpg filters i've tried.

well, if that text is included then how would a recipient tell that it
ISN'T signed? i consider it a security feature that all any non-signed
text is suppressed. and i don't know of ANY list where all of the messages
are signed, so a user would still be able to see such information from
other users' posts... and... if anything that important is happening on
the list, then it probably warrants a message, rather than a footer.
footers below the pgp headers can still be viewed (in pine) using the
[H]eader command, set up to display the raw message.
what RFC is that?  ;p

nonetheless, i *will* count that as the first argument towards changing

filter for pine that behaves that way that.
seriously though, the reason that i don't use that convention is because i
send signed mail to lists and people who don't use pgp/gpg... and i don't
want my email to be formatted differently depending on whether or not it
is signed... so, to the extent that i can, i avoid using lines that start

that's not "political rhetoric", that's a point of fact regarding pine.
as long as it involves the USE of gpg, i'd say it's on topic here.
they don't seem to have an interest in security, either (i say this after
raising security issues with the pine devel group, and receiving an
asinine response that demonstrated a serious lack of understanding about
security protocols). despite my own use of pine, this is evident in the
pine changelog. as i become more aware of these issues, my motivation to
migrate away from pine grows stronger.
len, have you tried ez-pine-gpg? it was written after i was disappointed
with the other gpg/pine filters.
and a violation of the pgp/mime and s/mime RFCs.
*if* the pine API even allows it...

Hash: SHA1
correct. this is the case *anytime* multiple recipients are specified, not
only the case of encrypt-to-self. if an attacker wants to know the session
key, they can attack the "weakest" public that a message is encrypted to.
as i understand it, the public key implementations does not help an
attacker compute another private key, used in the same message.
part of the security of ANY encryption scheme depends not just on how
secure/paranoid ~you~ are, but also how secure/paranoid is the person
you're communicating with. a mistake on *their* end can cause *your*
secrets to not be secret.

unless it's an ancient version of PGP(tm) it should auto-magically handle
other algorithms. from the OpenPGP spec:
   Implementations MUST implement Triple-DES. Implementations SHOULD
   implement IDEA and CAST5. Implementations MAY implement any other
   algorithm.
IDEA is the *only* symmetric algorithm mentioned in the spec that gpg
doesn't handle "out of the box." you can use: 3DES (168), CAST5 (128),
blowfish (128), AES-128, AES-192, AES-256, twofish (256).

@_subject: MUA questions 
the body of an email should really only contain plain-old ascii.
for signing attachments, i would either:
 a) attach a signature for each attachment
 b) specify the hash of any attachments in the body, and sign the body
i prefer the latter.
i'm also curious which clients make it easy/hard to decrypt/verify a
message sent in a particular way, not just whether or not they crash.
i'm a fan of pine, although it has no native support at all for PGP. there
are some "plug-in" scripts that make it very nice though, as long as
everything is in-line. attachments have to be saved to a file and then
dealt with manually...
decryption and verification can be done 100% auto-pilot, as long as
everything is in the message body.
encryption and signing can be done with 1-2 extra keystrokes (not counting
a password!) or one of them can be configured to be the default way of
sending mail.
i have to admit that i did get a chuckle out of the outhouse reference...
anything that berates M$ is fine with me.

what exactly does --local-user silently ignore? that part doesn't make

on reading the --default-key description, i would have thought that if i
use it to sign something and specify key "xyz" then that key would be
assumed to be my signing key for future signatures, unless otherwise
specified... but that doesn't seem to be the case.

the bottom before appending the signature, but i've seen other versions of
gpg (linux) leave a blank line between the end of the signed text and the
beginning of the signature. is one way right and the other way wrong? are
both ways acceptable? what prevents this from causing problems in real

if anyone out there wants to test-drive a pre-release version.... i have
some scripts for doing gpg in pine. this version is being considered for
release (under GPL).

it's done in bourne shell. for speed and security it does not use temp
files. it aims to be fast, secure, and goof-proof (or at least highly goof
resistant). i really think [after it's configured] it's easy enough for
people who are new to gpg but not dumbed down, so even power users should
enjoy it.
when it's released it'll include an install script that gives the option
of auto-magically setting up the pine config file.
it also handles roles (signing) and dash-addresses (signing and
there is no install script yet, and very little documentation. i've had
very little feedback so far, but it's all been good.

one could also scan in their social security card, drivers license, work
id, etc... although these are all used to "prove" identity i think that
their inclusion in a public key would only makes it easier for the
information to be abused, just like a handwritten signature.
when signing keys, the important thing is that one has verified the
fingerprint(s) through secure channels... secure channels could mean
meeting for hot/cold beverages, a phone call between two (or more) people
who recognize each others voices, etc.
i don't use a GUI for any gpg/pgp interaction, so you could include a

@_subject: multiple self signatures 
Hash: SHA1
i noticed this myself, after updating my cipher preferences and adding
bzip2 to my compression prefs.
i'm sure someone will correct me if i'm wrong, but my observation is this:
if i update my preferences, i create a new signature (which validates
those prefs along with the key associated with them). it seems that gpg
has enough smarts to *replace* my old signature(s) with my new
signature(s), so when i'm done editing the key i still have one signature
per key element (UID, subkey, etc). (when updating prefs, we're dealing
with the signature on the UID)
now, if i go and import an old copy of my key, or someone imports my new
key on top of their old copy of my key, gpg will (of course) combine all
of the signatures that it can find for the key... this creates multiple
these extra self signatures shouldn't cause any harm, but nonetheless i
don't like them. if you want to get rid of them, you can run
"--edit-key"... then "check" will list the signatures and the dates...
then you can do "delsig" and go through the list of signatures, deleting
the ones you don't want.
(is there any documentation of "delsig"? i didn't see it in the man page
that came with 1.2.4)
** DO NOT DELETE ALL OF YOUR SELF SIGNATURES!! **
this way you have a slim key that you can hand out, but once that key goes
into circulation (keyrings, key servers), ALL signatures will find there
way onto it, if those signatures were circulated.
you can look at the self-sigs on the key referenced in the URL at the
bottom of my email (don't import it, yet!) and look at the self
signatures.... then get that same key from a keyserver and look at those
self-sigs... then, import them both and you'll see the self sigs breed....
the old sigs from the key server and the new sigs from my www link will be
moral of the story... if this type of thing concerns you, do all editing
of your key *before* you distribute it. of course, if you decide to add
new prefs as they're available (like the recent addition of bzip2 in
1.2.x), then there's no way around it.
disclaimer - this is based on my observations, YMMV. if something i've
said up there isn't quite right, i'm sure it will be corrected by someone
on the list who knows better.

it'll prompt you for your password to decrypt the encrypted message, and
then after decrypting, it will convert spaces into "x"s.
i'm using gpg 1.2.4 and encryption/decryption on my system *does* preserve
trailing spaces. if you get the same results, then gpg isn't the culprit.
i'm not sure, but i think one of the SMTP RFCs specifies that trailing
spaces can (should? must?) be disposed of, so your MUA might be doing
the parts of the OpenPGP RFC (2440) that mention trailing spaces don't
seem to apply here. on my reading of it, it seems that trailing spaces are
ignored by signature applications, but it doesn't say anything about
disposing of those trailing spaces. indeed, they seem to be preserved even
when signing (at least on my machine).

AFAIK, all MUAs that use gpg/pgp need those programs to be installed
independently, but some MUAs talk directly to those programs (like kmail),
other MUAs have helper programs and scripts that let the MUA and the
encryption app talk to each other (like pine).

i would argue that it's not a good thing to leave the email address out of

then you'd likely be causing problems for people.

the address was harvested from a keyserver. that may or may not hold true
for any length of time into the future, but it's what i've seen so far. i
would like to see the keyservers put a little bit of pro-active defenses
in place against address harvesting: it's currently too easy for it to be
done either intentionally or accidentally, by someone linking to a page
that matches a *lot* of keys...
regardless of where your address is harvested from, there are some great
bayesian filters out there... i use (and personally recommend) spambayes.
the easy way:
=09gpg --export [-a] some-key-ID | pgpdump | egrep 'User ID -'
the "-a" is optional, and of course you'll need to install 'pgpdump'.

Hash: SHA1
i would say that a web mail account is not a safe place for anything. it's
subject to incompetence, hacking and FTMP they can disable your account
with or without reason, with or without notice.
i consider a safe place to be a bank safe deposit box. you can store keys
and revocation certificates there on disk and/or printed out. if you have
a *good* safe in your home or office, that might work. most people think a
$100 fire-safe is a safe... if someone can pick it up and walk out with
it, it's not safe! in my experience, for a safe to be practical, it must
weigh at least 600-700 pounds (275-325 Kg) (minimum!) and/or be bolted to
a concrete floor.
one of the reasons that i have an expiration date on my keys is in the
event that i lose them... they'll revoke themselves!
also, for anyone who thinks they're likely to lose their secret key or
password, consider designating a revoker... someone you trust, who can be
called and asked to revoke your key for you. of course, this has to be set
up ahead of time.

if the key has not yet been circulated, you can add a new UID and then
delete the older one. if the key has been circulated, that would be a
waste of time, since keyservers and keychains will never "forget" the UID
that you want to get rid of, and will always add it to any copy of your
key that they find.
i think if i were in your shoes, i'd have a primary key that just has the
"usual" name, comment and email. then, i'd add a second UID that includes
a BRIEF explanation of the key that is superseded.

every now again, someone asks if they can have different pass-phrases for

having never seen or found instructions for creating a private key with
multiple pass-phrases, i decided to write a tutorial on how to do it.
this is a first draft of this tutorial. i hope that it's useful to anyone
interested in creating such keys. if anyone notices anything that needs to
be corrected or explained differently, please let me know.

if one's pgp key identifies them by real name, it's fairly straight
forward to verify their ID and confirm their identity, so that their key
can be signed with confidence.
what happens, though, when one uses a pseudonym, alias, or "hacker name"
as the name in their pgp key? if one is at a key-signing party, or just a
room full of pgp users, how does one "prove" that identity?
how much of the verification relies on control of an email address and
key, vs how much depends on verifying the name of the person? would a
photo in the key add credibility?

here's a thought....
let's say i meet someone and their key-name is a pseudonym. we want to
sign each others' keys, but i have no idea who this person is.
we can generate a random string (while face-to-face) and each write that
down on paper (taking precautions that this shared secret remains secret).
later, i generate (by myself) a second random string and email it to them,
encrypted and signed. when they mail me back both strings, encrypted and
signed, i sign their key and send it back encrypted (and delete my local
copy of their key signature). when the signature appears publicly, can
there be much doubt that i'm dealing with the same person i met?
if both of us are using pseudonyms, we agree on two random strings when we
meet... one string is their secret that they confirm with me, the other is
my secret that i confirm with them.
how secure (trusted?) is such a protocol?
what level of trust (signature) would this earn?
in such a situation, what disclaimers might someone use in a policy-url?

after reviewing some how-to guides for key-signing parties, they
universally seem to skip any address verification!?!
according to the current how-to guides for a key-signing party, someone
could show up with ID that says "osama bin laden" and a key with my email
address.... the ID checks out with the name on the key-id, and
everything's fine; people sign osama bin laden's key with my email
address... and then the FBI comes knocking on my door.
maybe that's a stretch, but shouldn't confirming an email address be just
as important as confirming a real name? the address could be incorrect
either by accident or malice.

voice authentication works for people we know... my brother and i
confirmed each others keys by reading the fingerprints over the phone (his
key isn't in circulation, so there was no point in signing each others
keys). that would be a tough thing to spoof, since we've known each other
for quite a while ;)
at the other extreme, there are a few people here that i've been chatting
with off list, but having never met them, i would not sign their keys over
the phone.
using myself as an example, let's say i don't have any formal ID that
identifies me as "atom smasher" (whether or not i do is not a factor...
let's just say i don't). of course, some people have known me as "atom
smasher" for years, but most of them don't use pgp (so they don't count).
so, if i'm at a conference and i want to exchange key signatures with
people, i can prove that i currently control this email address and key by
sending some secrets back and forth.... not a problem... but if i want to
"prove" that i'm atom smasher...?? that could be tough....
and the weird thing is that the key-signing how-to guides go into detail
about verifying the fingerprint and name... that's only 2/3 of identifying
a key! in my situation, i can easily confirm 2/3 (email and fingerprint),
but it's not the 2/3 that most people are trained to look for.
is 2/3 good enough? should people sign my key if i prove my email address
and fingerprint are correct? or should the how-to guides be updated to
recognize that 1/3 of the identification process is currently missing?
in any case, i'm still looking for suggestions on proving a pseudononymous

that, too, should be made more explicit in the how-to guides. they tend to
range from instructing people to "sign the key and then you're done", to
"upload the signed key to a key-server."
what if i was personally introduced to you as "atom smasher"? what if i
was introduced by someone who we've both personally known for years? what
if i was speaking at a conference, and identified as "atom smasher"?
assuming that you don't have any faith in who i claim to be (which is up
to you: i have to admit, i am suspicious), would you sign a key based only
on verification of an email address? would you sign it as:
 * "I have not checked at all (1)"?
 * "I have done casual checking (2)"?
 * "I will not answer (0)"?
would you use a unique policy-url to describe the conditions under which
the key was signed? what might it say?
i'm not trying to put you under the spotlight or prove you wrong; nor do i
think there are any "wrong" answers. i'm trying to provoke the exchange of
ideas on how to solve this real-world problem... i'd actually like to hear
from anyone who can explain an answer that makes sense to them.

(note the new subject.)
yes, but doing it this way means that my old and new key remain compatible
with each other... i can sign something with the new key, and it still
verifies with my old key: someone can encrypt to my old key, and i can
decrypt with my new key. this also means that anyone who "trusts" the old
key should "trust" the new key, since it incorporates the old key.
if someone doesn't know that the old key is revoked, everything still
works fine. if they notice the revocation, they might also notice the
revocation comment that directs people to the new key.

thinking out loud....
looking at things the other way... i think we would all agree to NOT sign
a key if:
 1) the email address is not correct
 2) the key fingerprint is not correct
 3) there is doubt as to the person's identity (real or pseudononymous)
seeing how much thought i've provoked looking at this question forwards,
how about looking at it backwards (under what circumstances would one
*NOT* sign a key)...
1) if one knows that the email address is not correct, one would probably
have no reason to sign a key. using the suggestion that a signature be
sent, encrypted, to the key-holders email address enforces this rule.
2) if the fingerprint is not correct, one would not sign a key. it's
interesting that a fingerprint is public knowledge, but infeasible to
fake. although an impostor cannot create a key having a predetermined
fingerprint, an impostor could *easily* present a "marks" key, and the
fingerprint will necessarily match.
the first two are easy yes/no answers... now it gets hard...
3) if asked to sign a key that says "monica lewinsky" buy a guy who claims
that it's really his name (trust me!), but his wallet was just stolen,
we'd all say no (i hope!). on the other hand, if someone's key identifies
them as "kevin ilyanovich rasputin kubusheskie" and they have a passport,
birth certificate, drivers license and govt issued ID, and we've known
them since pre-school, we'd sign their key (i think).
i think the issue of identity is shady for anyone who we don't ~really~
know... someone's name could ~really~ be "george w bush", and they could
really have the ID to prove it... that doesn't mean they're *the* george w
bush. if this is someone i know, i'd sign the key. if this is someone i
don't know, i'd be suspicious... they could be an impostor.
in between these extremes is a lot of gray area... some people have known
me for years as "atom smasher"... i don't think they'd have any problems
signing my key.
maybe it's not so difficult at all... maybe the process still relies on
"trusted introducers", but in a strictly social sense, absent any keys and
computers... could it be that i've just over-analyzed this to an
extraordinary degree?
after all, a key can be signed as "i have not checked at all", "i have
done casual checking" and "i will not answer"! wouldn't one of these three
apply to someone using an alias? or someone we don't really know?
in which case, how much is accomplished by a physical meeting? let's say
i'm going to defcon, and in advance of that i exchange some encrypted
secrets with other attendees... we all arrange to meet at the conference,
and physically exchange those secrets [in printed form]. that can't
possibly prove that i'm really me! *maybe* having a picture on my key
would help, but maybe not... if my brother serves as a body double. i
could have him claim to be me, and exchange those printed secrets! with
that in mind, what would be lost if i exchange encrypted secrets only via
email... say over the period of a month, and *then* exchange key
signatures? of course, if one is using a name that they can prove (not to
be confused with their real name!) then it's in their best interest to
meet in person and produce ID... but when signing a pseudononymous key,
what can be gained by a physical meeting? how can that be compensated for?
enough rambling... time for me to eat...

the more i ponder this, the closer i come to this conclusion...
a name is a social construct that works well in small groups. in large
groups, it will tend to have a high failure rate in uniquely identifying a
person. despite it's failings in a social context, the construct has been
largely adopted 'as-is' as a legal construct, with nearly all of it's
failure original modes left intact, and some new failure modes created in
the process.
here in the states, civil judgments ("a" sues "b" for $x) are often
entered using only a persons name... this *frequently* results in people
having their credit screwed up because someone with the same (or very
similar) name owes money. if the courts can't get that straight, how can
we be expected to?
there must not be any anarchists on the list... thinking about this
problem from an anarchist perspective, one might conclude that verifying a
person's identity "serves the state" and is therefore bad. i suppose this
was hinted at since it creates a database of "who knows who".
email addresses are more likely than names to be a unique identifier, but
a person is (typically) more likely to keep their name for the duration of
their life.
all of that said, i still understand a value of verifying, to the best of
one's abilities, that a person is who they claim to be before signing
their key... it's just that proving a name can't always be the most
important thing in that verification process...
of the three checks that a person can do before signing, maybe that
[verifying the name] is important in *some* settings... maybe email
address is most important in *some* settings... maybe, in some settings,
verifying the fingerprint is the best we can hope for... the hard part
then, is establishing guidelines that are generally agreed on in regards
to key-signing... under what conditions do we assign different priorities
to different methods of establishing identity? the current documentation
on key-signing tends to share the same faults repeated in many places, so
this is a great opportunity to "rewrite the book", as they say....
now, if we can only figure out how to rewrite it...

that last part might not make sense the way most of us think about pgp
keys, so i'll explain my logic.
let's say a key is distributed and its UID reads:
all we ~really~ know about the owner of that key is their public key and
its fingerprint.
if such a key is used to sign advance warnings of terrorist attacks, then
we would probably come to "trust" that the owner of that key really is who
they claim to be, even though the ONLY verifiable information we have is
their key fingerprint. (such trust would be dependent on that particular
group taking credit for such attacks)
such a key provides no email address to verify and only a vague pseudonym
as a name, yet it can still earn trust. signing such a key presents a
unique set of problems (social, legal and moral), beyond the intended
scope of this thread, but such a key CAN earn trust that (on a purely
technical level) might justify a signature: they seem to really be who
they claim to be.
moral of the story: a key *can* earn trust even when we have no way of
knowing the identity of the key's owner.

not a problem, since i didn't really collect any signatures on the old
key. i re-evaluated my needs for pgp, and the new key serves those needs
better than the old key... i decided that the sooner i switch, the sooner
i can start soliciting signatures for the new key.
i'm not asking anyone to ~sign~ the key based on the incorporation of the
old key components, i'm asking people to trust it as much (or as little)
as they did previously. if someone wanted to sign the new key based on
their verification of the old key, that's up to them.
anyone can do that with any (sub)keys.
what would be hard to fake would be:
 * state the new key is valid and sign it with the old key
 * revoke the old key with a comment such as:
both of those should keep FUD to a minimum. i've done both.
there are arguments for and against that... but i don't plan on doing it.
that could be... this is part of the experiment and remains to be seen ;)

do you mean only the owner of the key can decrypt?
or only the owner of the key can use?
if you mean the former, that can be accomplished by signing their key and
sending it to them, encrypted. after they successfully decrypt it, they
can then circulate it.
if you mean the latter, then it serves no purpose in the web of trust.
or... do you mean i signature that's not easily traced back to the signer?
in which case, one could generate keys all day long, use them to sign
their dubious key... which would seem to only pollute the web of trust.
