don't you have to specify ascii armoring on the command line tho?
andreas doesn't do that in his command line.  or is gpg smart enough
to ascii armor a .txt output file based on extension?

@_subject: double encryption 
hmmmm.  isn't 3DES just DES 3 times?  given the above, how much
stronger is 3DES than 2DES and DES?

@_subject: weird WARNING messages with 1.0.7 
gpg: WARNING: --honor-http-proxy is a deprecated option,
gpg: please use "--keyserver-options honor-http-proxy" instead.
gpg: You should edit your ~/.gnupg/options and replace the line
gpg: "honor-http-proxy" by a line
gpg: "keyserver-options honor-http-proxy".  Note that the leading
gpg: dashes are not used in the options file.
gpg: Thank you for using gnupg.  Was it good for you?

@_subject: compiling problems gpg 1.0.7 
have you double checked to make sure that the source and desstination
in the install command exist?  i.e. do all the directories in
in your build tree? in ~gpg1.0.7 do a find . -name rndlinux, what
happens?  is /usr/local physically on the box you are installing this
or is it maybe nfs mounted?  can you, as root, touch
again as root?

@_subject: Can't run GPG through php on linux (works fine through telnet) 
i think what you want is:
gpg --status-fd 5 --no-default-keyring --keyring $keyring_file --always-trust -r $key_name -o $out_file -e $in_file 5>>$status_file
as soon as *nix sees the 5>>, it begins to execute.  everything else
on the command line is tossed.  all redirects should come at the end
of your command line.
