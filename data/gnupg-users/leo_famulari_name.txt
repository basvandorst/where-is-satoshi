@_subject: GPGME Python bindings 
I'm working on downstream packaging of GPGME and GPGME's Python language
bindings for GNU Guix. [0]
Because it was easier, we began packaging the GPGME Python bindings
based on the PyPi release [1] of version 1.8.0.
However, since that time, GPGME has had a few more releases, but the
PyPi release has not been updated.
How should we interpret this? Does it mean that we should continue to
package version 1.8.0 of Python bindings? Or should we try to build them
from the latest GPGME source release?
