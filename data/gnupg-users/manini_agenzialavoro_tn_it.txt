@_subject: Question on additional IDs and sub-keys 
Hi, I've just started "learning" pgp, so please be patient. I've managed to create my key, exchange it with a friend, send and receive messages and so on. So the basic is ok and may be I
do not need nothing more, but while studying...
So I don't understand additional IDs and sub-keys. It seems to me that additional ID's are just different "additional
info" (name, email address). If I encrypt a message for two different
ID's of the same KEY, what's the difference?
Subkeys are also obscure. When I encrypt a message can I choose the
subkeys to be used?
