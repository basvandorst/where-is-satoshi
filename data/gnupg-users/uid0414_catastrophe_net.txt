@_subject: Interesting... 
; Here's a rather interesting article: ; ; ; I am glad GnuPG is open to review by our community to aviod
; these issues.
Normally I'd blow these off, but given the state of computer and Internet
security at this point, it deserves a good flame.
  1. What measures have you taken to verify that the authors of GnuPG
     have not backdoored their code?? Do you personally know the authors,
     and have you worked with them during every step of the development
     process to ensure they haven't been held at gunpoint to add      backdoors?
  2. How often do you perform a full cryptographic analysis of the functions
     used in GnuPG? Are you 100% sure they're the standard (i.e. they      haven't changed encryption algorithm BLA-31 to work around broken
     code, etc.)?
  3. Have you performed step  listed above for GPGshell as well? How can
     you be certain a keystroke logger hasn't been built in to it to catch
     your passphrase?
  4. Have you done thorough source code auditing of your operating systems
     for each machine you use GPG on, and are you working in a clean room
     to ensure that the machines cannot be attacked and backdoored w/o
     your knowledge?
  5. Are you using built in kernel checksumming of swap space and have you
     changed GPG to verify it's checksum each time you run it?
My point here is that making statements as you have made due to some article
you've read is asinine. Yes, NAI's code checking skills obviously are
lacking, and yes eEye is only into things for the glamour they provide,
but please...get some ammo and not an article.

@_subject: Compilation Problem under OpenBSD 3.1 
When trying to compile gnupg-1.0.7 under OpenBSD 3.1 i386,
I get the following error.
gcc -E -I.. -I../include -DHAVE_CONFIG_H mpih-lshift.S | grep -v '^ > _mpih-lshift.s
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I.. -I../include    -g -O2 -Wall  -c _mpih-lshift.s

This happens with both the vanilla BSD make and gmake.
Any help is appreciated.

Sure, I could use 1.0.6, but I've already converted my keys over.

; Still no 'official' win32 release.

And a release that compiles on openbsd 3.1 would be nice.

; Can anyone (Werner?) explain why no official Win32 build of 1.0.7 has ; emerged after two months? Is it political, technical, or economic, or a ; combination thereof?
; ; I know GPG is free software, Windows is not, etc. but as an open-source ; developer who has distributed 15,000+ copies of Win32 GPG 1.0.6 with my ; own software, I'm just curious...
Also, maybe ask why it doens't compile under OpenBSD 3.x :)

; Hmm.  There was a change between 1.0.6 and 1.0.7 to improve the

; ; 1.0.6 worked for you, right?
using the `configure --disable-asm` works fine too.
