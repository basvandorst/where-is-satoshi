@_subject: cipher stored with my key 
How can I store my favorite cipher with my key? In PGP 7 I can select my
preffered algorithm and then generate an new key pair. When I view the key
properties of the key it show cipher "AES-256" for example.
1) Is this possible in GnuPG? How can I select my cipher for the key?
2) How can I get the name of the cipher which is stored with my key?
3) When I get a message, how can I display the name of the cipher which has
encrypted the message?
Excuse my bad english.
