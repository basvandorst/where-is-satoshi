While I have nothing against (rapid) prototyping in general, it is not
the advisable method for each and every project or person. I prefer
spending time designing software, with pencil and paper or what have
you, before writing the first lines of code. That helps with figuring
out what one is trying to achieve, and the basics of how to achieve it,
lowering the risk of getting bogged down in issues of design oversight
or of the chosen programming language.
This, of course, should best be discussed elsewhere. ;-)

Legal identification is required. Since you are German, you can use
as a reference for how this can be done.

I'm not certain what problem you see that has not been around for as
long as PGP/GPG exists? You can only ever be certain of a signature if
you have personally verified the signing key and the signer's identity.
That's why the default owner trust level is "unknown" (not trusted).

They can't. That's one of the reasons the "web of trust" is a tricky
concept. Among all of the people I know to use PGP, I trust only two to
verify both key fingerprints and identities as thoroughly as I do. That
means I usually have to jump through hoops to verify stuff myself, and
that only works for people I have personally met (and checked their
Personalausweis or what have you). My web of trust is almost non-existent.
Yours might be extensive. It all depends on what you verify yourself and
who else you trust to verify. As Robert wrote, you seem to keep rehashing
the same issue, and an old one at that.
You mean there are people who actually use Online-PA, and trust the BSI
on top of that? You're kidding, right? ;-) I neither care nor trust what
Governikus signs. I've been providing IT security services for decades,
and find it extremely hard to trust others in this field, based on my
own experience.

Yeah, that would be one way to make these sigs less obvious. Of course
it does not solve the underlying issue, but for the layman it might be
an improvement.

If you can solve the design problem of having a decentralised key
infrastucture, the ability for everyone to create and sign keys without
third party involvement, and the detection/prevention of "fake" sigs
(whatever fake may mean), I'm sure we all would be interested. ;-)

I agree. In my experience, this stance--publicly documented--will allow
people to say to their bosses "support has ended, and for security
reasons we now need a budget to finance a move away from this outdated
software". I have seen similar situations often enough; nobody would
spend money as long as the old software horse was still twitching.
Discontinue version 1.4 right away, quoting Efail as a trigger if you
wish, and set an EOL for version 2.0 in a few months, as you suggested.
People are going to be (temporarily) very annoyed anyway, so go all the
way. Like Ferdinand von Schill said: "Lieber ein Ende mit Schrecken als
ein Schrecken ohne Ende."

Who said "have to be prevented"? Please keep in mind that GPG is
maintained on a voluntary basis. If the people who do the actual work
decide to not maintain outdated software anymore, so they can focus
their limited resources on current releases, they are completely free
to do so and don't deserve to be chastised for the decision.
If somebody wants support for old GPG versions, they can damn well pay
people for that. In more than three decades in this business I have seen
too many users who think that paying for software licenses and upkeep
is an inconvenience, and who take open source software for an all-you-
can-gobble buffet without a thought for the authors. I am not implying
you are one of these people, mind you.

This thread really has me pulling my hair--what's left of it. Some core
aspects from where I am standing:
1. GPG is maintained by volunteers. If you have any complaint about how
this maintenance is progressing, get off your behind and be a volunteer
yourself, or failing that, provide an incentive--money would be nice--to
existing volunteers. See also: Gift horses, not looking in the mouth of.
2. GPG 1.4 will not suddenly vanish if it is no longer maintained.
People can still use it like before. Maybe they shouldn't, but they can.
3. GPG 1.4 has been outdated for what amounts to ages in terms of
software life cycles. Whoever has not migrated so far will also not
migrate if you give him another 6 or 12 months. While everybody is free
to stick with 1.4, nobody is required to waste resources on maintenance
efforts, unless it gives him some strange pleasure to do so. I think
that only a fait accompli in the form of dropping version 1.4 support
will push the procrastinators in management to release necessary funds.
What I percieve a lot in this thread are variations of "I wanna stay in
bed for five more minutes mommy". I wonder if Werner and Robert should
charge 5 EUR for every incident of whining to secure some funds?
Get off your collective bums and out of bed, children! ;-)

* Nicholas Papadonis:
Apple's on-board Mail requires a plugin to encrypt/decrypt messages.
While GPG Suite ( provides said plugin, it is no
longer free to use. Once the trial period runs out, you won't be able to
encrypt, sign or verify unless you pay for a "support plan".
I suggest you go for Thunderbird plus Enigmail, unless you are really
keen on using Apple software.
If you're willing to stray off the beaten path, you may also want to
evaluate the Notmuch mail system ( I use EMACS
as a frontend for Notmuch, meaning that I have powerful GPG integration
provided by the editor, but there are other UIs as well.

* Andrew Luke Nesbit:
Enigmail needs any one PGP/GPG binary. GPG Suite includes a binary that
is based on the official GnuPG sources. Other options to get such a
binary include using packages available via MacPorts, Homebrew or
compiling GPG yourself. In the end, all is based on the work of Werner
et al.
