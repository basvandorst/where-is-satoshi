@_subject: Using of subkeys for encryption 
i have a problem while encrypting a message. I'm using the OpenPGP Card but i think the Problem doesn't depends on it.
I've got a an decrypted e-mail and if i try to encrypt the e-mail i got a "gpg: public key decryption failed: wrong secret key used". The ID of the used key is an ID an a subkey. Usualy I don't use the subkey for de- and encryption, but i don't know anythink about the subkeys. According to the GnuPG Handbook it should work to use the subkey.
Have a nice day and a good morning :),
Here is the complete output:
patrick gpg very_secret.gpg
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID XXXXXXXX, created XXXX-XX-XX
      "Another Person "

@_subject: hard-copy backups 
i think you are mixing up two different things. on the one hand you have the problem of security of your data, e.g. no one should read your mails, etc. . on the other hand you have the problem of date recovery.
for security you are using a very well gnupg setup.
for data recovery you realy need a copy of your keys. paiper is one of the most robust medium to backup date (the egyptain know a more robust medium, but the usual computer user is not able to use a hammer and a chisel ;) ). i think you shoud take your paper (or flagstone), put them into a sealed envelope. give it to you local bank. the german bsi has written a book called it-grundschutzhandbuch imho there is also an english version avalable. maybe you want to read this.
i know this little trick from the c64. there was a program called mse :)
have a nice day,
 patrick
