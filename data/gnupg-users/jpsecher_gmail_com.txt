@_subject: gpg-agent, ssh-add & crypto card keys 
On one system (Debian Lenny), I am using an SSH key on a FSFE
Fellowship crypto card to make SSH logins to a remote host, mostly by
using  Karsten Gerloff's instructions [1], and this functionality is
indeed "extremely cool".
I have now tried to do the same on another system (also Debian Lenny),
and everything works fine except that ssh-add is seeing the SSH key on
the crypto card.  In other words, I can see what's on the crypto card
  $ gpg --card-status
  Application ID ...: D2760001240101010001000003330000

I can encrypt and decrypt:
  $ gpg -e foo.txt
  $ gpg -d foo.txt.gpg
which makes pinentry-gtk-2 ask me my passphrase.
gpg-agent is started with '--enable-ssh-support', and the environment
seems right:
  $ set | egrep 'AGENT|SSH'
  GPG_AGENT_INFO=/tmp/gpg-7ciDXH/S.gpg-agent:3429:1
  SSH_AGENT_PID=3429
  SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/gpg-zsc6dQ/S.gpg-agent.ssh
But 'ssh-add -l' shows no keys.
ssh-add has an option '-s reader', but I cannot figure out what
'reader' should be, and tracing trough the source code does not make
me any wiser.
Do anyone have any suggestions on how to proceed?

Sorry about my late reply.  Thanks a lot for your help!
The problem seemed to be that
 1. Use a regular key (ie. .ssh/id_rsa) with ssh-add to login via ssh,
and no card inserted.
 2. Inserting the card.
 3. Now the card was not recognised by ssh-add -l.
When I write in past tense, it is because everything seems to work
fine now, and I have not been able to reproduce.
The problem /might/ have been solved by an automatic update to
I am sorry I cannot be more specific, but if the problem does not
resurface, I guess everything is fine.

That was quite unlucky, because there should be approximately 77000
people gathered together to get a probability of 50% of a collision,
according to  :-)
