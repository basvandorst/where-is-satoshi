@_subject: Exporting GnuPG-secret-key to PGP 6.5 (Windows NT) 
I am using GnuPG 1.0.2 on my Linux-box at home. At work I must work with a
WindowsNT-box. I tried to export my GnuPG-secret-key (with gpg --armor
--export-secret-key ). But PGP always says "invalid key". On the web I
found an article that suggested to remove the passphrase before exporting
the secret-key. But that did not work.
What is my fault (besides using Windows ;-) )?
Please CC me your answer, because I am not subscribed to this list.
Thanks in advance
