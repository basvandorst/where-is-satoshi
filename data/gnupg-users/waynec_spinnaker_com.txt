The source for the remove/restore passphrase procedure may be
the "PGP5-GnuPG HOWTO" document; there is a link to this on
  This HOWTO refers to the original
Unix PGP 5.0; that version apparently did not have an option to export
a secret key, so the HOWTO instructed you to use GPG to extract the
secret key from the PGP keyring, after removing the passphrase.  I
don't know why GPG couldn't handle the PGP passphrase.
Presumably, later Unix versions of PGP are able to export secret keys.

@_subject: Mutt and old-style encrypted and signed messages 
I had one correspondent who would send everything, included PGP mail,
with an added HTML formatted attachment.  Since his messages were
already "Content-Type: multipart/", the procmail recipe didn't fix
them.  Fortunately, the 1.3.* versions of mutt (beta) have a new
command, "check-traditional-pgp".  Bound by default to "ESC-P", it
checks a message, and all attachments, for old style PGP format,
substitutes a temporary Content-Type header, and enables mutt to
automatically decrypts or verify the message.
If you can't use procmail, or have older messages which were never
checked by procmail, this can be handy.  It is also useful when you
put the PGP procmail recipes at the end of your .procmailrc, and never
catch the messages handled by all the recipes which appear before the
PGP recipe...
