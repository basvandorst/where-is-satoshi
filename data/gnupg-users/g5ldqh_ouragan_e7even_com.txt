Interestingly there is a provision for a secrecy requirement, which makes it an offence for the recipient of a notice to
disclose to others that he has been ordered to reveal a key or
plaintext data.  This is intended to allow covert investigators
to obtain a key and continue to monitor traffic.
``Automatic tipping-off
  ---------------------
  Where a disclosure occurs contrary to a secrecy requirement
  it is a defence for a person to show that the disclosure was   automatic and effected entirely by the operational software
  designed to indicate that a key to protect information ceases
  to be secure and they could not reasonably have prevented   that taking place, whether after being given the notice or   becoming aware of its contents.'' ( para 10.15 pg 52 )
In other words, if the software had a tripwire function that notified other nominated individuals when a private key was exported then the subject of the notice may not necessarily go to jail for ``tipping-off''.
