Please a CC to my address for replies. Thanx.
When I send a pgp/gpg messages with mutt 1.2 (default sample source for
mutt) to a window client with pgp7, I can't open the pgp attachment.
Windows is talking about "Can't find PGP information in file" (or
something like that).
Anyone a similar experience and sollution?
