Hi GnuPGs,
I am fairly new to this list, so you might want to get your flame
throwers ready ;->
My problem: I want to send a message to somebody who offers a PGP 5.0
key and I only have GnuPG.
To encrypt a message I have to import the key. But that does not work.
There is that documentation at  about interoperation with
PGP 5.0 but, unfortunately, the text says nothing about importing keys.
Detailed output:
  # gpg --version
  gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.1
  Copyright (C) 1999 (...)
  Supported algorithms:
  Cipher: IDEA, 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH
  Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA, ELG
  Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160
  # gpg --debug --import < tmp.pub
  gpg: reading options from `/uhome/schamane/.gnupg/options'
  gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
  gpg: processing message failed: eof
I have attached the key that I want to import.

@_subject: getting rid of blowfishes (was Re: Windoze PGP Compatability) 
Actually, I like blowfishes (I mean the fish) but I understand that
there are better alternatives when dealing with encryption.
How can I move from the default BLOWFISH to some other cipher? Since my
key is encrypted with BLOWFISH I can't just disable it, can I?
I thought the trick is to remove the password, export the keys and
import them again with BLOWFISH disabled. But when I try to reprotect my
secret key GnuPG says
  gpg: protect_secret_key failed: unknown cipher algorithm
Probably, I misunderstood some basics. Any clarification appreciated.
Last question: If we should avoid BLOWFISH what cipher should we use?
I know that this question cannot be dealt with in detail here. But maybe
somebody can write a short note about her or his preferences (without
being flamed by others ;) from an average user's point of view.
The alternatives so far are: 3DES, CAST5 and TWOFISH.
