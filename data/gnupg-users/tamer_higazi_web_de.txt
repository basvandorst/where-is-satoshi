@_subject: BAD signature and (2) auto SHA1 
1. Bad singniture means that you didn't sign the key of your korrespondent You have to do it with
gpg --edit-key UserID
The UserID is available with:
gpg --list-keys
then you receive an output on the screen with all public keys (and your own keypair). Beside th keynumber
like this.... pub  4096R/E65ACC8A
UserID would be: E65ACC8A
so the command would be: gpg --edit-key E65ACC8A
then you run the 3 commands:
sign (wants your password of your secretkey to sign this key)
trust (to trust the key)
save (to save all changes and to get out of the key-edit-menu and return back to the shell)
After you have signed and trust the key the next time you recieve from the other person a signed message, will be registered under GPG as "Good Signiture" because you have signed  his/her key before.
2. People sometimes sign messages which has no value. As i described at Point1 you have to sign and trust the other key which you added before in your keyring (the are stored all in pubring.gpg <>).

@_subject: gpg recognize problem with EMail Plugins 
I installed gpg and gpg me under linux (1.2.2) from the source this way under SuSE Linux 8.2:
./configure --prefix=/usr
make install
All GPG Plugins can't recognize gpg, i guess. Not KGPG, Enigmall ( Mozilla Mail Plugin recognize GPG and my keys.
Every message I receive and try to decrypt doesn't succeed. I receive always the message "Bad Passphrase" what is not true. If i encrypt/decrpyt from the commandline a message then it works. So, it's not a a wrong password i entered.
I guess, it is a configuration problem. If somebody could help me, thank Tamer Higazi
