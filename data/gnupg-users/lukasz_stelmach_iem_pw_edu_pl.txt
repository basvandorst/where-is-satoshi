@_subject: GPF Crypto Stick vs OpenPGP Card  
I'd like to buy either of . Which one should I choose?
If I choose OpenPGP Card it would porbably be an ID-OOO with a small
USB reader so in both cases I end up with a USB stick.
The Card and a reader is 35?, the Stick is 49?. Is there a reason to
choose the latter?
I've seen this question asked when the Stick has been released but
without any answer given.

Most probably two. But if I choose the Card+stick-reader option, I will
buy two readers.
Is it strictly required for the Card.
Portability, the physical one, is near, if not on the very top of the
list of priorities. I've got two PCs and a netbook (without a slot for
PCMCIA/ExpressCards). That's why I don't consider buying ID-O (full
size) Card and *some* readers.
Most probably not. No PC I know and don't trust, has GPG installed. If
it won't by mine the it will belong to someone who is conscious enough
to both: install GPG and keep the PC quite clean.
I am not that paranoid to carry a full sized card reader with a PIN pad
with me.
Without but with a Gemalto USB Shell Token V2 reader (USB stick form

As far as I know about crypto smartcards (not only OpenPGP on) they have
software onboard that can generate a key pair but there is virtually no
code that can send it outside of the card.
I know: secret keys may be uploaded to a card but not downloaded from
it. I think (read speculate): the above question is asked when you
generate a key pair on the PC and upload it to a card.

@_subject: [OT] broken threading via gmane 
I've noticed that Gmane's doing something evil to message-ids in this
group. I read several other groups via Gmane and this is *the only* that
has such broken threading.
Hank Ivy started the "Protecting IDs at a keysigning party" thread with
e message   <201012081420.14986.hankivy at hot.rr.com>
which has been mangled at Gmane to
  <201012081420.14986.hankivy__6874.93589143759$1291842486$gmane$org at hot.rr.com>
David Shaw's reply refers to the original non-gmane ID. Even though my
MUA (Gnus) puts David's message somewhere near Hank's (they share the
subject) it can't put it completely right. BTW David's message-id is
mangled to.
I assume it's because of some strange settings specific to this
particular group. Is there anyone who could, please, fix this?
PS. I send this message via Gmane with an ID:
  <874oaiocpp.fsf%lukasz.stelmach at iem.pw.edu.pl>
