Hash: SHA1
Some people in my keyring send and receive emails using multiple
addresses (say, name and name but each one of them
just keep one keep key which only maps to one of the addresses (say,
name Now every time I'm sending / replying mails to their
secondary addresses (name my mail client (Mozilla +
Enigmail) will complain that it doesn't know name and I have
to manually select the key that maps to name
Assume that I can't get them to add them secondary address to their
keys, is it possible for me to tell my GPG that "hey! mails sending to
name should be using key that name key!)?

With a little tweak, I got it working in Mozilla + Enigmail! The problem of saying:
is that name will be the group name but not the email address. So when Enigmail tries to search this as an email address, it'll do a -r , which doens't work. So the obvious solution would be putting this in gpg.conf:
Thanks David!

1) I know this guy in person.
2) I know this guy is using the address name
3) I know this guy has an additional address name (Ok, hotmail might be a bad example. Let's say, his secondary address is I absolutely agree with u that HE should be the one to fix this... but hey! If u can't move building, will u just sit there and complain about it? Or would u actually try to walk around it? =)
