Hello all:
Trying to get gnupg running on my Cobalt RaQ4.  I get the following during
make[2]: *** [ttyio.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/packages/gnupg-1.4.0/util'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/packages/gnupg-1.4.0'
make: *** [all] Error 2
Make check yields much the same:
make[1]: *** [ttyio.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/packages/gnupg-1.4.0/util'
make: *** [check-recursive] Error 1
Needless to say, the make install errors and nothing really installs:
make[1]: *** [ttyio.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/packages/gnupg-1.4.0/util'
make: *** [install-recursive] Error 1
Ive ran make clean and hope that you can help me out!

The configure is fine, but the make still yields:

ttyio.c:166: `rl_catch_signals' undeclared (first use in this function)
ttyio.c:166: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once

Really old version I take it?
The RaQ is about 4 years old now id say.

So I see, as it installed fine now.  Thank you for your prompt help!
