@_subject: Keysigning request 
Is there anyone in the Chicago area who would be willing and able to meet me to
sign my GPG key?  Yes, I have looked on Biglumber and contacted several people
from there.  Yes, I have searched for WoT groups in the area.  No, not one
person has met with me yet.  I will only be in Chicago for the next few days.
If you, or someone you know, is in the Chicago area and would be able to meet
with me to id me and sign my key, I would very much appreciate it.  Thank you
for your time.
