@_subject: Questions about OpenPGP best practices 
Many thanks to Daniel Kahn Gillmor for pointing to the best practices
page (
this information is very helpful.
Some questions about the information on this page:
1. "Don't use pgp.mit.edu". Which keyserver *should* be used? I assume
that a pool is better than a particular server; is there one
particular pool that is preferred? What about
2. On keeping an encrypted backup of my secret key material, what
method is recommended for doing that? (Presumably something like "gpg
--export-secret-keys | gpg --output secretkeymatter.gpg --symmetric"?)
3. On using a keyserver with HKPS support: when I attempt to connect
(via Chrome) to  I get an error headlined
"The site's security certificate is not trusted!", stating " the
server presented a certificate issued by an entity that is not trusted
by your computer's operating system."
4. When I try to use hkps://sks-keyservers.net with GnuPG at the
command line, I get these messages:
gpgkeys: HTTP post error 1: unsupported protocol
gpg: keyserver internal error
gpg: keyserver send failed: Keyserver error
And when I try the same with the domain name only (sks-keyservers.net)
I get these messages:
: can't connect to `sks-keyservers.net': No route to host
gpgkeys: HTTP post error 7: couldn't connect: No route to host
gpg: keyserver internal error
gpg: keyserver send failed: Keyserver error
My question would be, am I doing something wrong or is the service unavailable?
Thank you!
