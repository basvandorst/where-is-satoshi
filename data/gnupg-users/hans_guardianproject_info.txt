@_subject: GnuPG Command line: now in the Play Store! 
This alpha release of our command-line developer tool brings GnuPG to Android
for the first time!
GNU Privacy Guard Command-Line (gpgcli) gives you command line access to
the entire GnuPG suite of encryption software. GPG is GNU?s tool for
end-to-end secure communication and encrypted data storage. This trusted
protocol is the free software alternative to PGP. GnuPG 2.1 is the new
modularized version of GnuPG that now supports OpenPGP and S/MIME.
Before using gpgcli, be sure to launch the app and let it finish its
installation process. Once it has completed, then you're ready to use it.
The easiest way to get started with gpgcli is to install Android Terminal
Emulator. gpgcli will automatically configure Android Terminal Emulator as
long as you have the "Allow PATH extensions" settings enabled. Get the
Android Terminal Emulator at

Since GnuPG has run on Mac OS X and FreeBSD for a long time now, it should be
a pretty easy port to get GnuPG running on iPhone.  Someone would have to make

Good point.  I forgot about the iTunes restrictions, they are not compatible
with the GPL for sure, and probably not the LGPL, so a GnuPG port cannot be
legally distributed in Apple iTunes.

@_subject: using an OpenPGP card with Java (keytool and jarsigner) 
Hey all,
Does anyone know if there is any chance of using an OpenPGP smart card for
Java?  I know that GnuPG doesn't support PKCS but I was wondering if
things work the otherway around: java using the OpenPGP card.  It would be
super useful to be able to use the same smartcard for both Android APK signing
and OpenPGP signing.

opensc's support for the OpenPGP card has improved quite a bit in 0.13, it
seems.  There is now full write support and a specific 'openpgp-tool' even:
I don't need write support at all, I just want to get keytool to use the
OpenPGP card as a PKCS11 keystore.  It seems that things are close: Java can
use NSS as a provider of PKCS11.  I guess the question is whether opensc is
making a PKCS interface to the OpenPGP card, that's the bit that I don't
fully understand.
Once I figure this out, my plan is to integrate my work into the relevant
Debian packages, and then promote the use of the OpenPGP card for Android APK
signing keys.

So now I have it to the point where I can see the certificate on the OpenPGP
card with keytool, but I can't get jarsigner to use it.  Do I have to mark the

@_subject: using an OpenPGP card with Java (keytool and jarsigner) 
I haven't tried scute, but it seems that opensc v0.13 provides a PKCS
interface to the OpenPGP card.  I am able to get keytool to report the
certificate in key position  but the question I have now is that given that
key  is for authentication, is there some restriction in the OpenPGP card
that would prevent the certificate/key combo in position  from being used
for signing?
I did read about using opensc with an OpenPGP card to provide S/MIME services.
 What I read there is that in order to use the certificate/key combo in
position  for decrypting emails, the key in position  (decryption) must
match the key in position number   Is there a similar restriction for signing?
I forget if I mentioned this, but the grand goal is to have a single hardware
security module that can sign the Android APK using jarsigner, then make a
OpenPGP signature on the APK, then optionally provide authentication for
scp'ing the resulting files to the release server.

have Java's keytool talking to the OpenPGP card via OpenSC, I just can't get
it to sign something yet.

GnuPrivacyGuard for Android (GPGA) brings GnuPG, the most trusted name in
encryption, to Android.  Easily encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify files of any
kind, just by sharing them to GPGA. This app aims to provide a complete,
integrated cryptographic toolkit integrated into the Android experience. GPGA
provides solid encryption for files private, and for verifying that files are
who you think they are.  It includes optimizations to make it operate many
times faster than other encryption packages on Android.
GPGA provides an integrated experience, so clicking on OpenPGP files "just
works".  You can also share files to GPGA to decrypt, encrypt, sign, or verify
them.  GPGA will respond when you click on a OpenPGP fingerprint URL (one that
starts with openpgp4fpr:).
GPGA also gives you complete command line access to the entire GnuPG suite of
encryption software. It also serves as the test bed for complete Android
integration for all of GnuPG's crypto services, including OpenPGP, symmetric
encryption, and more.
GPGA is available in: Arabic (???????), English, French (Fran?ais), German
(Deutsch), Norwegian (Norsk), Portuguese (Portugu?s), Spanish (Espa?ol).

Werner Koch:
In my 20 years of experience attending and organizing all sorts of tech
conferences, I find that open conferences tend to better than closed ones.
But mostly, the open- or closedness is not the biggest factor in the signal to
noise ratio. Instead, it is the level of organization.
The best conferences I've been to have been completely open and mostly
self-organized (aka Barcamp aka Unconference).  But that requires a specific
audience that is well practiced in self-organization.  I have been to very
good conferences that were semi-self-organized, i.e. barcamp-style with some
well practiced moderators really guiding the whole process (for example, a
"Gunner Event" run by Aspiration Tech). And as Werner says, it is much easier
to tell people in person to reduce the noise than it is on all of the various
open internet forums we operate on.
I really think it is quite important that these summits are open to anyone who
wants to attend.  I have run a number of barcamps with small groups, so I'm
happy to help moderate if I can attend.

@_subject: Thoughts on GnuPG and automation 
As the lead dev on the Android port of GnuPG, I definitely can share your pain
on working with the GnuPG suite.  For example, GnuPG is built heavily around
UNIX assumptions, and Android is not UNIX at all, and it is much further from
UNIX than Windows is.  We ultimately got pinentry working on Android, with
much struggle.  After going through that, I also had lots of grips, which I
probably should have written up like you did.
With all the recent attention to GnuPG and Werner's work, I have begun to
think about things differently.  GnuPG has an amazing security track record.
It has had few serious security bugs, nothing even close to heartbleed that I
know of, and yet it is core to providing security to GNU/Linux distros, as
well as protecting people like Laura Poitras and Edward Snowden.  So instead
of complaining about the difficulties, I now try to think about whether such
difficulties might actually be related to what makes GnuPG so solid.  I think
anyone interested in providing usable security needs to think hard about this.
 Sure we can make things easier to use, but it is a very slippery slope
towards reducing security.
I also have to call out that part of the problem that mailpile is continuing:
it is generally more fun to write code, rather than figure out someone else's
library.  That is especially true when its a complicated thing like GnuPG.
But in order to have shared maintenance and work, we all need to take
responsibility and try to build upon the work of others whenever possible.
Mailpile did not do that, and instead wrote yet another incomplete python API
for GnuPG.
Now all that said, we definitely need to be debating how to improve working
with GnuPG so that we can build software that is intuitive and private by
design, on top of the solid GnuPG track record.  For example, I think that
`gpg --json` is great idea.  I ended up using a Java wrapper of GPGME, which
is in turn a wrapper of GnuPG.  I think it makes a lot more sense to have `gpg
--json` as the parseble interface, then implement a GPGME-style framework in
each language (Python, Java, etc).
Another possibility is making ASSUAN, the internal protocol between GnuPG
components, the API instead of `gpg --json`. This only works on GnuPG 2.1, as
far as I understand it, since in 2.1, even commands like gpg communicate with
gpg-agent using ASSUAN, and it is actually gpg-agent that does all the work.
Contrary to the mailpile write-ups, I think that having all the work happen in
gpg-agent makes sense, as long as there is a good API to it.

First, most of these "let PGP die" rants only really apply to OpenPGP email.
GPG does a wonderful job of signing and verifying packages for Debian, Ubuntu,
Fedora, etc.
Second, OpenPGP email exists now, can be installed and used right now, and
provides proven protection for the body of an email message.  Millions of
people know how to use it, and can teach others.
That said, yes, I agree that OpenPGP email is a very flawed system, and we
should also be working on a modern replacement.  But that does not exist, not
really even close.  So if you need privacy in email now, OpenPGP email is the
main realistic choice.

The standard PGP keyserver pool is a mess with racist spam, lost keys that will be there forever, etc.  The concept of email validation is very very common and proven in internet service providers.  It is time for OpenPGP keyservers to join the rest of the internet.
Keyservers should not be located in jurisdictions where they could be sued for merely acting as a conduit for data.  There are many countries that meet this criteria.  The US is one good example there: internet service providers are not liable for what their users do.

@_date: 2015-03-03 14:00:23
@_author: Hans of Guardian 
@_subject: German ct magazine postulates death of pgp encryption 
Services like keybase.io with poor security practices are going to rapidly take over from the PGP keyserver pool because they address side of the human interaction, unlike the PGP keyservers.  They are easy to use and the follow the very common interaction patterns that basically all web services these days use. That must also be considered when thinking about security.  The PGP keyservers need email validation not as a way to provide any kind of "trusted" status of that key, but rather so enable people to delete keys that should no longer be there, and to prevent keyserver spam and vandalism.  For a good example, search for Richard Stallman and you will see how badly the PGP keyservers are failing.
Another common scenario is that people make mistakes when learning how to use PGP.  There is a common mistake of generating a key to play with, publishing to the keyserver, then deleting.  That key will then be on the keyserver forever with no way to delete it.  That is terrible both security-wise because it is confusing for people who are searching for keys, and it is terrible human-interaction-wise because it adds pointless noise when searching for keys.

@_subject: Thoughts on GnuPG and automation 
It is actually more difficult to wrap GPGME in Java than to have just rewritten GPGME in Java.  GPGME is a fine API for C/C++, it is a bad API for other languages.  You end up with an API that feels like a C API forced into the language, e.g. Java, python, etc.  That makes for more coding mistakes because it feels foreign to the programmer.  More mistakes means more security issues.

@_subject: Thoughts on GnuPG and automation 
I think if you actually disagree, you are missing my essential point.  But my guess is that we agree more than disagree.  Of course, I entirely agree that bad usability can also make a technically secure system actually very insecure.  This point is not mutually exclusive with what I said, and indeed both must be taken fully into account.
So for example, we could make PGP email really easy if we consider only a mass surveillance threat model.  Just make all the processes transparent in the background: passphrases, key generation, downloading public keys, etc.  But that would produce a system that would not work for the highly targeted threat models like Edward Snowden and Laura Poitras.  They would need to use a specialized system, and that specialized system might then be a marker of suspicion (for example, lots of governments, including the NSA, already mark all PGP messages as suspicious).  That then makes it a lot harder for people who suddenly realize that they might be under scrutiny.
There is a big tide of thinking about usability of security tools.  This is a great thing, and we need lots of contributions. But what it happening far too often these days is that the new generation are trumpeting "ease of use" above all else.  We are seeing systems like keybase.io that make things really easy, but also expect users to upload their _private_ key to some alpha web service.  That is terrible security practice.
I've also been arguing that we need to make encryption much easier to do.  But we are failing as UX designers if we do not deeply understand the systems that are trying to make easier to use.  And that is why I advocate thinking long and hard about GnuPG, and what makes it hard to use, and what makes it secure.  Only then can we really make solid security usable.
I strongly support an effort to make a clean, modern method of interacting with GnuPG.  Then we can make flexible, maintainable, and native-feeling GnuPG libraries.  I think that `gpg --json` encapsulates the idea quite well.  Then --with-colons can remain as is for compatibility.
The big question here is: who is going to do the work?  And I don't think it is a valid question to just punt and say "GnuPG has all this money now".  It is bigger than that.
Werner wasn't too keen in the past, but maybe there are some new thoughts on this.  `gpg --json` seems like a worthwhile fallback for public ASSUAN.
My guess is that you can achieve whatever you want to achieve using a custom pinentry.  But my memory is rusting, and Abel Luck, the other main dev on the Android port, did the bulk of that work.

Different programming languages and operating systems can have very different ways of launching and handling external processes.  By forcing them all to launch GPG in the UNIX way makes for complicated and weird software.  For example, Android works very differently than any UNIX or even Windows, especially when it comes to launching and managing processes.
At the risk of being repetitive: Android runs the Linux kernel, but is it far far far from being UNIX or GNU/Linux.

This is definitely public information from the Snowden leaks.  There is also quite a bit of information about other governments doing similar things.  Here's one example article:
keybase has started to downplay the private key stuff.  When it started, you had to upload your private key to use the service.
Uploading your private key to keybase sets people up for a centralized system with terrible security. It'll be an obvious target, and they are a startup doing webby things, which also has a terrible security track record.  There are so many exploits in ruby, javascript, etc.  The fact that they even considered this an option just shows that they only care about easy, not about secure.

The way that GPGME wraps gpg is built entirely on UNIX assumptions, which is turns out that Windows works actually pretty close to that.  Android, on the other hand is a very different story. Some key differences:
* Android will kill apps when it needs to, app lifecycle is automatically managed,
 the app has no control over it, and often zero warning is given
* Android was not meant to support launching processes from a shell/terminal,
 it was there for core debugging, then opened up on demand from devs, but it
 is very much a second class citizen to a Java Android app.
* all apps are child processes of 'zygote'
* there is no way to install shared libraries to be shared by apps
There are other differences as well.  And iOS actually works a lot like Android, but also blends some UNIX stuff in.  I think we can also find similar issues when looking at how to make a proper Python API for GnuPG (though probably not as extreme).

If you are interested, you should read the details.  Because you are missing some key details here.  I believe they log all PGP encrypted communication.  That would be easy for them to do.  I don't know about HTTPS.

In Android, you can't really have shared libraries.  Apps share functionality at a higher level (aka Activities and Services).  So GnuPG-for-Android _is_ the shared library in effect, since it provides OpenPGP via Activities.
No one is saying that each app should have a custom wrapper for GnuPG.  What I think mailpile is saying, and what I'm trying to say is that for programming environments where GPGME does not make sense, there should be the ability to easily make a native version of what GPGME is doing.

And that is why this thread is going on, so hopefully we can come to an agreement that there are many areas where GnuPG can be used but GPGME is a bad solution to do it.  That is all I ask really from this thread at this point.  The bizarre Java wrapper of GPGME was not the biggest part of the problem of the GnuPG-for-Android port, but it was nonetheless a real problem.   Sure it is possible to use GPGME with Java, but it is not good, and ill-fitting APIs make for bad software, which in turn often leads to bad security.  It also took a lot of time.  In retrospect, I think it would have been quicker to write a native GPGME in Java on Android than to continue the work on the gnupg-for-java wrapper.
Now I'm trying to convey my experience of what I learned by actually getting GPGME working on Android, and how the situation can be improved.  It turns out that I came to some quite similar conclusions to the mailpile team: there needs to be a shared interface for native frameworks, GPGME is not the way for many popular environments.

I guess you forget that we worked a lot on it, ported it to GnuPG 2.1 and
recent GPGME versions, and added features.  There have been some other
projects starting to use our version as well.
Its been a long while since I was working on the guts of this, so the details
escape me.  I can only say now what I remember without digging into the code
again.  One thing that is very clear to me: we spent a ton of time figuring
out how to debug on Android, then actually running the debugging processes.
That would have been drastically easier if we had been working with pure Java
code that talked to the GnuPG processes.  The Android tools are all about
Java.  And having all those layers of code wrapping code makes debugging also
much harder.
Another thing I remember clearly is that I had to first thing about
implementing new features in JNI, then in Java.  There are also a lot of times
where data structures should be passed between Java and JNI, and that is
generally a painful process in JNI.  A pure Java interface to the GnuPG
processes would totally eliminate that.
At this point, I've done a lot of various things on Android, including running
native processes, and JNI code.  Working with a Java wrapper of GPGME made
implementing things take many more hours, probably like 3-4 times as much, as
I would expect from more native Android development.

Why do I get so many responses like this on this list?  I've spent a ton of
time solving our own problems with the Android port, we also made sure to take
out a support contract with Werner to pay him to answer our questions.  I only
wish we'd had more so we could pay him for all the work he has done, but we
have long since run out of money for working on GnuPG.  I continue this on my
own time because I believe it is important.
The point of this discussion is to talk about an shared architecture for using
GnuPG outside of C/C++ on UNIX.  That's why Bjarni started it, and that's why
I've joined in here.  It seems that half of this thread has been griping about
the discussion process.  We need a little more faith in each other so we can
have productive discussions and further our shared goals.

Werner Koch:
OOM killer is only comparable to the Android lifecycle in that it has the
power to kill processes.  In Android, apps are killed regularly, often many
times a day.  GNU/Linux was designed around the user telling a process to end
(i.e. File->Quit or TERM).  OOM killer is only a last resort in extreme
situations. Android is designed around the system entirely determining when
apps are terminated.
It is a Linux kernel, which is most often used in UNIX-style OSes.  But
Android does not follow UNIX style, and Linux does not require an OS to follow
them either.  For example, in Android, UIDs and GIDs represent system
permissions, not users and groups.  You are going to be confusing things if
you expect Android's Linux kernel to provide a UNIX environment for you.  Even
when Android's Linux kernel does support UNIX-ish things like symlinks, the
Android runtime layer does not treat them as first class citizens.  Even
things like mount paths work differently in Android.  A given mount path can
have multiple simulatenous locations mounted to it, one per Android user account.
Sure, that sounds good.  I'm sorry I can't make the April meeting.  I'll be
back in Europe this summer indefinitely.  I might be able to put together a
multi-pronged trip to your area of the world, if that makes sense.  But
perhaps it makes the most sense to have a meeting at a relevant conference or
similar thing.

Daniele Nicolodi:
There are other C-Python wrappers of GPGME, like pyme.  I hope you're aware of
those, and have studied them.  One thing that GnuPG suffers from is many
people starting their own wrappers, but few people finishing them or
contributing to existing ones.  That is not a sustainable situation.

I expect a discussion about what is working and what is not working with GPGME
and various GnuPG APIs.  I'm just trying to convey my experience with
GnuPG-for-Android, gnupg-for-java, and a little bit with Python.  I hope this
will spur people to offer their experience, and generate new ideas and
approaches.  gpgme-tool is one version of that, `gpg --json` is another.

 system that meets your needs. If possible,  (and here again I am clarifying my original post) work with the people on this group to help you use the existing tools to get your requirements met. But speaking as a professional engineer of 25+ years experience, you will not get your desired results by starting the conversation impuning the work that went before and claiming that what you are asking for is far superior. If it is not your intent to convey that message then please review what you write before you send it, because that message was received loud and clear.

Sounds like you should report it directly to GPGTools.org.  I'm sure they have
a bug tracker or mailing address somewhere.
Have you seen any technical details on this attack?  Its hard to tell exactly
what's happening from that article.

We've basically only used gnupg-for-java in our Android app GnuPG for Android,
so it is not so polished on desktop, as you saw.

For the record, my work on GnuPG was largely funded by the US Government, via
the State Department/Radio Free Asia/Open Technology Fund.  So are other
projects like Tor Project, Mailvelope, crypto.cat, NoScript, and many more.  I
don't think that being associated with the US Government automatically
disqualifies your contributions of free software.

@_subject: How to deal with a 2nd OpenPGP Summit? 
I've attended all manner of conferences/meetings from big to small,
invite-only to open doors, expensive to free, heavily organized to improvised.
 I think far and away the most productive conferences for groups of 20+ people
are Unconference/Barcamp/"Gunner-style" conferences, which are totally open,
have no fixed agenda, and have 1-4 moderators to run the intro sections of the
day where the day's agenda is created.  These kinds of events have also been
the most fun conferences/meetings that I've attended.
What such an event does require is that people as a group have enough social
skills to know when it is appropriate to talk, and also to know when it is
appropriate to ask someone to stop talking until another time/place.  Good
moderators help a lot with that task.  Then we can have focused, productive
meetings without having to manage who can attend.  It also takes much less
pre-planning to run such an event, since the organizers do not need to work
out topics, schedules, etc.  Just space and overall timing (i.e. 5 rooms from
I am willing to serve as a moderator, though I can't say I'm the best at it.
I've helped organized and run DrupalCamp, MySQLCamp, iPhoneDevCamp, PdCon, and
If there is a budget for this event, then Allen Gunn/Aspiration Tech could be
hired to run the event.  He's an excellent moderator, especially for groups of
people that are unfamiliar with this format.
