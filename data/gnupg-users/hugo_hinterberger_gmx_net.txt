@_subject: Mailvelope [OpenPGP.js] key size vs. GnuPG 
I created a key using Mailvelope (the key I intended to use did not work  with Mailvelope) and I noticed that GnuPG shows rsa2048 for the [SC]  primary key and rsa2047 for the [E] subkey. Mailvelope shows 2048 bits for  both keys.
My guess is that Mailvelope generates the keys and shows the key  properties incorrectly.
My question to the list is: Are there known side effects from using such a  key? (Besides the fact that it is not what I expected it to be.)

I just tried the Clipboard - Sign feature in GPA and noticed that when I  copy the signed message to the clipboard that an empty line is inserted  after each line generated for the signature, but not for the original  message or modified lines (escaped line with "--" ? "- --").
System: Windows 7 64-bit
Kind regards,

@_subject: "key algorithm" in GnuPG's signature verification output 
It seems that you (MFPA) changed your signing practice after I noted that  I can't verify signatures created with your key ?1AF778E4?. I did not know  that one could sign a message with two keys in one signing block.
I am wondering if there is a way to collapse the verification result for a  multi-key signature down to a single ?good? or ?bad? value/result, because  Enigmail gave me some ambiguous message about your signatures.
Kind regards,

Hi Chris,
I hope I understood you correctly.
I use ?"? when it is required. In regular text I try to follow typographical conventions for text.
Nothing seems to be broken on my end. It might be an encoding issue, but I could not find one on my side. It could also have to do with the fonts you are using.
Below are some details.
I use a DIN 2137-1:2012-06 T2 keyboard layout and try to make use of it.
The default encoding of my messages should be UTF-8, the message format is set to MIME with no special text encoding (neither quoted printable nor base64), and I allow 8-bit characters in headers.
I read the mailing list through Gmane (too little mailing list support in my e-mail clients, yes I use a few).
I noticed some processing of my messages after they were sent (base64 Using [1] to decode the payload of the news article under observation of the content-type header (charset="utf-8") gives me my expected result,
as do the messages archived at [2] and [3] (with Chrome on Windows).

I am still trying to find a working solution to verify incoming files and messages with GnuPG on Windows ? and I want the solution to be able to handle PGP/MIME messages read through Gmane using elliptic curve based keys. I just have started to try signing messages.
I tried signing a text several times, every time with the same result, the broken signature.
I just tried to reproduce my previous results; now it seems to work.
What is different? I ran Windows Update. I tried it on the console before using GPA.
OK, so I did some more experimenting:
1. Sign ?Clipboard? in GPA using key 1.
2. Sign signed text in ?Clipboard? in GPA using key 2.
3. Verify text in ?Clipboard? in GPA.
4. Verify text in ?Clipboard? in GPA.
After 1.: Signed text looks fine, just like on the console.
After 2.: Signed text looks fine, just like on the console (two ?BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE? and two PGP signature blocks).
After 3.: Validation successful (valid), message stripped of signature is mangled (empty lines inserted).
After 4.: Validation successful (valid), message stripped of signature is mangled again (now each line is followed by two empty lines).
Copying text from ?Clipboard? in GPA to Windows clipboard results in message stripped of signature after step 4 to not be mangled, except for two newlines at the end of the message (they were not there at the start).
The text copied to the Windows clipboard is mangled again (just the signature part): every line created by GPA is followed by 2 empty lines, the original message seems unchanged.
Verifying the content of the Windows clipboard by pasing it into the ?Clipboard? in GPA results in a ?"Clipboard" contained no OpenPGP data.? Something is rotten in the state of GPA.

Hi Johan,
On the one hand: I do not think so.
The text was completely in the US-ASCII range and showed up correctly in the ?Clipboard? in GPA. The issue should not have been related to my settings for my messaging software (I do not see how).
On the other hand: I can't reproduce this issue any more, as stated in [1].

Hi MFPA,
I am currently not actively trying to get a working environment. I am
exploring the current state of affairs. I am also not comletely passive, as
you may have noticed.
I am not trying to get all my issues addressed, I was repeatedly told that
my expectations are way too high.
E. g.: How hard can it be to combine genealogy data with your contacts and
show a reminder when certain people (family members, ...) have an
anniversary or birthday coming up? In the area I grew up it is sometimes
customary to arrange a service in church for deceased family members ? it
would be nice to have things like those pop up automatically in a calendar.
Windows 7 64-bit and Windows 8.1 64-bit
I uninstalled Thunderbird and Enigmail since it was slooow and does not seem
to be able to handle Mime in news articles. It also created ambiguous
notifications for your signatures.
I can verify clearsigned message. It is not anywhere near what I would
describe as user friendly, but it can be done.
I completely failed to manually verify PGP/MIME messages, on the command line, so far.
I have Symantec Encryption Desktop 10.3.2 in Limited Use/Unlicensed Mode
installed, that offers the PGP Viewer tool that is a complexity level above
using GPA (drag 'n drop for verification works fine, as long as you already
have the senders key in your keyring and you trust it, but the result
behaves like a picture).
GPA, in comparison, does not support drag 'n drop, so one has to fiddle
around with the file open dialogue, and for the same file that verifies fine
in Encryption Desktop GPA tells me the signature is ?Bad?.
nntps://news.gmane.org (currently with an expired self-signed certificate)
Windows Live Mail 2012 (pretty crappy, but still one of the better tools I
That's why I am testing GnuPG 2.1.1-beta35 right now.
PowerArchiver Enryption Suite supports ECC, via Eldos's SecureBlackbox
library as far as i know, but the UI still needs work.
Just a side note: I heard somewhere that the Austrian health insurance cards
(ecard) utilises ECC somehow . I'll have to check this at some point.

this should go to: "MFPA <2014-667rhzu3dc-lists-groups at riseup.net>", sorry  if it goes on the list "gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.user" too (minor  user/MUA f-), although this might be interesting to Werner Koch also.
I just tried to verify your message, but failed at importing your key.
GPG tellst me that the key packet is of an obsolete version 3.
Do you have the key in a newer format?
Is it possible to import the old key somehow?
I attached the console session and public key used.

I noticed that for malformed PGP messages there is no notification of the  user in GPA. When verifying a malformed PGP message an empty verification  result windows is shown (see attached image).
I am still not able to load (receive) keys from key servers. On the  command line I get the error "keyserver receive failed: No keyserver  available". in GPA I get the warning message "No keys were found.". I  verified, that the key is available on the key servers. I attached my  (redacted) gpg.conf

Hi Kristian,
On Mon, 24 Nov 2014 21:40:22 +0100, Kristian Fiskerstrand  OK, so: sks-keyservers.netCA.crt is a PEM encoded (...BEGIN  CERTIFICATE...END CERTIFICATE...) certificate and is hardlinked to  sks-keyservers.netCA.pem . The files are located in %appdata%/gnupg/ .
In dirmngr.conf I have the following line:
hkp-cacert  In gpg.conf I have also the following line:
keyserver-options  This means I have both options set => no change: No keyserver available.
I commented out the line in gpg.conf => still no change.
Pinging the keyserver works.
Hmm... I just tried to:
and I got:
OpenSSL: error:0906D06C:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio:no start line
OpenSSL: error:140B0009:SSL routines:SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file:PEM lib
Disabling SSL due to encountered errors.
OK, using "--ca-certificate" instead of "--certificate" worked, so the  network seems to be OK.
gpg --keyserver hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key  gpg --keyserver  --recv-key  Both fail. Using hkp, on the other hand, works.

Seems to me to be a slightly different issue.

I created those files and folders and placed a hardlink to the  .pem-certificate in the trusted-certs folder.

Hello Werner,
When I try to open the Card Manager in GPA the program freezes. according  to Process Manager there is something (not much, almost nothing) going on,  but the UI does not respond any more.
Another thing: when running gpa a series of console windows pop up and  close before the UI appears. This is just a slight annoyance.
