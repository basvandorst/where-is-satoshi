@_subject: RSA 1024 ridiculous 
This seems to be more-or-less on schedule:
IF you have a life-long digital secret that you want to protect from
people with hundreds of millions of dollars to spend, and you insist on
using RSA public key encryption to protect it during transit over the
internet, then you need to use RSA 15,360 (not a typo) + AES 256 + hope.
But, I think RSA 3072 + AES 128 should be good enough to get you a
waterboarding ticket; even RSA 1024 + 3DES would result in spyware or a
key logger on your client machine to prevent them from having to fill up
the bucket.
Regarding HTTPS: If you go to any SSL certificate vendor, you will see
them talking only about "256 bit SSL" and they usually have no
recommendations at all regarding the RSA key length. The certificate
vendors treat HTTPS as a marketing feature and not a security feature.
As a result, the RSA 1024 + AES 256 is the most common combination I see
when I'm browsing with Firefox.
I cannot find it in the specs right now, but I think that even the
latest S/MIME and PGP/MIME specs only require implementations to support
RSA keys sizes up to 2048 bits. I have used 4096 bit keys for (Thawte
Freemail) S/MIME certificates in Thunderbird and Outlook 2003 without

@_subject: RSA useless for encryption was: RE: RSA 1024 ridiculous 
That is not what the RSA website says. The website says, more-or-less,
everything that has ever been encrypted with an 1024-bit key will be
practically decipherable by 2010. That means, if you didn't want the
data you sent over a compromised channel to be readable by 2010, you
should have NEVER used RSA 1024 to start with. It does not mean "stop
using RSA 1024 in 2010."
Here's one way to think about it: If you have a E-commerce site, and you
are protecting credit card numbers using RSA 1024 + AES 128, you should
not accept any credit card that expires in 2010 or later. But, if you
take RSA's recommendation to heart, you are safe in accepting any card
that expires 2009 or earlier.
Similarly, that website says, more-or-less, if you use RSA 2048 to
protect data that you distribute, then that data will be protected until
That is why I said that, if you want to protect data for your *entire
lifetime*, i.e. you don't want your data to be unprotected until after
you die, you need to use RSA 15K + AES, or switch algorithms altogether.
But, even now, if you have a secret that you want to keep for a year or
two, RSA 1024 + 3DES is more than sufficient protection, even against
very powerful entities.

@_subject: RSA 4096 ridiculous? 
The software only needs to verify the signatures that are going to
affect the trust of the key. For a lot of people this will usually be a
very small number (0 or 1). Even if a key has hundreds of signatures, it
is unlikely that the user has (a) installed those hundreds of keys onto
the device, and (b) granted key-signing trust to more than a few of
them. None of the mobile phones I tried had no trouble using RSA 4096 to
encrypt or decrypt a 16 byte key. If the phone has a JVM and/or a web
browser, RSA 4096 and AES should be no problem.

Why not use a 2D barcode like a QR code? A QR code will hold most
typical keys, is easy for machines to read, is small, and has redundancy
features that allow it to work even if you hole-punch or black out part
of the code.

@_subject: Signing people with only one form of ID? 
Even that strict policy is hardly sensible, but it is better than the
policies that are often promoted.
I don't see how a keysigning party works. Anybody that participates by
showing ID is reducing their personal privacy by divulging their
personal information. Furthermore, caring around such ID is much more
likely to create a security problem (if it is lost or stolen) than
anything GPG can prevent. Finally, we give up a lot of personal security
when we give our personal information to governments to get our
government-issued IDs, which I think is a big mistake. Especially, when
I was staying in Thailand, I saw firsthand how governments (Thai,
American, and every other one) use ID controls to repress people they
don't like. Anybody that insists on government-issued ID for
authentication is doing the world a disservice.
For all those reasons, I am willing to sign anybody's keys at any level
without any authentication, using as many different signatures as they
require. And, I will do so with a set of keys that are not linked to my
(online or real-life) identity, so they cannot be blacklisted. Actually,
I would like to create a network of people with the same key-signing
policy. In doing so, I think it will be easy to demonstrate why the
current implementation of the web-of-trust via keysigining is
inadequate, especially when such a network of people participate in
keysigning parties to promote the authority of their own (bogus)
In an ideal world, the fact that I am disclosing this information in
advance should mean that mobody will sign my PGP key at any keysigning
party. I don't know how many I will be able to attend, but I will
attempt to get as many as signatures as I can, alternatively using my
birth name and a name of my own choosing (possibly copied from somebody
with a coincidentally similar appearance). It will be interesting to see
how many people will give me a level 5 classification with an identity
that can be traced back directly to this message.

@_subject: Signing people with only one form of ID? 
That is the assumption that I am challenging.
These are things I want to help change. There's got to be some mechanism that doesn't require (as much) hope,
and which doesn't require the loss of anonymity, at least for common
uses of PGP like personal email.
Would better IDs really help? It has got to be hard for a person to say
"I don't trust you or your ID, I'm not going to sign your key."

It is reasonable to choose to protect a secret for the rest of one's life (~100 years). In fact, I see no reason why that shouldn't be the default security level for everybody's personal use. That would require RSA 16,384 or more, according to RSA. Since that key size is impractically large for several interesting exchange technologies (e.g. 2D barcodes), that means we need to migrate to something else like ECC.

Exactly what question am I begging? I think it is reasonable to assume that people often have secrets that they want to take to their grave (at least). Everything I have read suggests that RSA 8192 will be broken within (some of) our lifetimes, so RSA 8192 or less is not enough. You basically said the same thing in your message.
Modern computers can handle RSA 16,384 without too much difficulty, so it isn't really impractical to use it. Even if it was impractical, there are other algorithms (ignored by gnupg) that are more efficient to use. I don't really see what sacrifices would have to be made, especially in terms of implementing gnupg.
I didn't say it was reasonable to choose extremely long keys, although it is. I said that if you want to keep a message encrypted for your entire lifetime, you need to use something stronger than RSA 8192....
...because something stronger than RSA 8192 will probably take longer to break than RSA 2048. Maybe RSA 16K isn't enough. But, anything less is definitely not enough.
At what point should we quit trying then? Now?
