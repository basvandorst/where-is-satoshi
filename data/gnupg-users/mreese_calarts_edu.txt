Hello Malte,
Though I have several keyservers listed in both PGP and GnuPG, the primary
one that my GnuPG uses, which also seems pretty reliable, is:

Hi John,
Indeed it does. Full integration with either GnuPG or PGP, including
PGP/MIME with both. The integrated support for both is built in, so
there's no need for third party plug-ins.
Though Windows users can use GnuPG as a purely command line program as
well, there are a couple of GUI front ends that can make it just as
easy, and in some ways better than using PGP in Windows (in my
Though it's not open source, "GPGshell" is a great GUI front end for
GnuPG in Windows, and just like PGPtray, PGPkeys, etc., can be used
with any email client or text editor, and also includes shell support.
Over the years, I've kept an eye on WinPT as well, and while this one
is open source, I've just never been as satisfied with it as I've been
with GPGshell, which I feel has always been both more polished and
more stable than WinPT.
Windows users of GnuPG interested in a GUI front end for GnuPG can
find GPGshell or WinPT here:

Hi Markus,
Well, I've tried Mutt (in Linux), along with all sorts of other email
clients in both Windows and Linux, and I've come to the conclusion
that I'll use a particular email client first and foremost *because of
how it can handle email*, then I'll decide the best way to use GnuPG
and/or PGP with it.
Since GnuPG can be dealt with via command line and/or third party GUI
front ends in Windows, and like PGP, can be used with any email
client/text editor regardless of integration/plug-in status, I'd much
rather stick with an email client I feel is the best for my *email
management*, and use GnuPG or PGP with it in whichever way works best
after that. Seamless email client integration with GnuPG or PGP, or
the lack thereof, is not enough of a reason for me to switch to a
different email client. :-)

@_subject: useless test keys and keyservers 
Hi David,
I think Neil made some interesting points about the automatic purging
option, but I am very interested in a couple things the new PGP Global
Directory beta makes possible, which allows a key owner to not only
remove their own keys from the keyserver, but also to decide whether
or not their keys are uploaded to the keyserver in the first place.
These are two things I've been wanting to see for a long time, and
wouldn't mind if all the keyservers adopted these options.
I'll have to look into the possibilities of Thunderbird some more, but
in my default email client, "The Bat!", I can accomplish this in a few
different ways; by using macros in a reply template based on the
folder (any reply message generated when replying to a message from my
"gnupg users Inbox" folder), address book entry template, or "quick
template" (which can be invoked manually). I've also created a "quick
template" that I can invoke manually if I want to reply off-list to
the original sender of a message instead of to the list.
Many lists will generate their own "reply to" header, in which case I
wouldn't need to do what I've described above, but for this list and a
couple others, I need to use template macros to get reply messages
like this to automatically put the list address in the "To" field of
reply messages.

Hi Greg,
I'll be looking into getting a web page set up for my keys, but for
now, I distribute them via email auto-responder. Just click on the
mailto in my signature, and send the resulting email message. An
auto-reply with the keys will be sent immediately.
And this is why I prefer to distribute my own keys. For the moment,
via email, and when I can finally get it together, on a web page.

Hi Stewart,
I've drafted a much longer and more detailed reply to your message,
but since this is becoming a bit off-topic with regards to "GnuPG
usage" specifically, I'll try to keep this reply as short and to the
point as possible.
I still suffer from my silly philosophical disagreement with the
current state of the keyservers, so I guess I'm kind of stuck, at the
moment, with with the choice between my "mailto" auto-reply method or
a web page where my keys can be obtained.
I just created a quick little web page for my keys (please see the URL
in my signature), but I'm afraid that as far as mouse clicking goes,
it's going to involve at least as much bother as clicking on my
previous "mailto"; though the potential problems with the subject line
and message body text of the "mailto" method is eliminated. I also
won't have to worry about keeping my email client running all the
Now, it seems to me that if you can't conveniently click on a mailto
in your email client, a URL won't be much better for you. Is this
correct? Or do you have an easier way to deal with web site URLs from
within your mailer?
In any event, short of simply uploading my keys to the keyservers, I
am trying to make the distribution process as painless as possible,
though I'm afraid I just won't be able to satisfy everyone, in every
way possible.  Again, I apologize for all the inconvenience.

@_subject: [OT] Re: useless test keys and keyservers 
Hi Stewart,
Yes, one of my greatest disappointments with the current keyserver
system is the ability of anyone to upload anyone else's keys.  I have
several keys, associated with several different accounts, and while
I've uploaded *one* of them to the keyservers myself, the rest were
uploaded by others.  In some cases, after they've signed my keys with
exportable signatures, though they don't know me, or my association
with certain keys from a hole in the ground.  Is that really "good
practice" in terms of "web of trust"?
When I have a bit of time, perhaps later tonight, I'll finish up the
longer message I started last night and send it along off-list.

Hash: RIPEMD160
Hi Henry,
First, unless your spelling of "Zimmerman" above was just a one time
typo, you might have better luck in searching if you spell his last
name with two "n"s on the end: "Zimmermann"
It's not much so far, but here's an article from January of this year
that mentions a few things he said about a flaw in MS Word:
You might try sending him an email if you really need to get in touch
with him. I've done this in the past when I've had questions to ask
him, and he was always very prompt with his replies.
As long as it's still a valid email address for him, click on the link
to his email address on the "How to contact" page of his site (it is
displayed on the page in anti-spam form, but clicking on the link
should open up your email client editor with the correct address
already in the "To" field):

I'm getting a peculiar warning message when I verify signed messages;
even messages signed using my own keys (GnuPG v1.4.1). Here's a sample
verification of one of my own messages:

gpg: original file name=''
gpg: Signature made 03/16/05 18:58:05 using RSA key ID 973073CF

gpg: textmode signature, digest algorithm RIPEMD160
I know that my key is given "Ultimate Trust", so I'm a bit confused
about that, but I get this same warning when I verify anyone else's
signed messages as well:
gpg: WARNING: Using untrusted key!
Does anyone know what this means?
Oh, by the way, this is on a WinXP SP2 system, with GnuPG v1.4.1

Hi David,
Thanks! I'll remove that option from my configuration file. For some
reason, I was under the impression that I needed that option if I
wanted to encrypt messages to keys that I haven't yet signed or
assigned any trust to, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
Thanks again!

Hi Dean,
I hope I'm not misunderstanding your question here. GnuPG has nothing
to do with searching email databases, archives, etc., as it's just an
encryption/digital signature program. However, some email clients do
offer various built-in search functions. My email client, The Bat!,
has a pretty good search setup. I'm not sure if yours does or not, as
I don't use it.
There's also a nice email archive/search/etc. program that I use for
various purposes, called "Mailbag Assistant" from Fookes Software:
With Mailbag Assistant, you can access the email databases of several
different email clients, then search on any of several variables at
the same time. It can do a lot more than just search email databases
though, and I've found this program to be very useful for several
functions having to do with email databases.
