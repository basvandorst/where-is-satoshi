If by insecure you mean, "could lead to exposing the contents of the file"
or "could reveal my passphrase" that would depend (in part) on the size and
contents of the file (i.e. very short files would less time consuming to
brute force, files with very regular formats would be quicker to brute
force, etc.) and the symmetric cipher used.
Revealing the plaintext of some files could be fairly significant with the
default symmetric cipher for GPG is CAST-128 which is potentially subject
to key recovery via a chosen plaintext attack. AES doesn't have any
presently known vulnerability of that sort.
If you just need a unique key to refer to the file, you're already storing
the source path in the "summary" file your tool generates. If you just need
a guaranteed unique identifier for each file (because, say, you're storing
them all flatly in a single directory), I would just hash the path (which
is apparently not sensitive data, as you seem to be storing it in plaintext
in the summary file) as it's guaranteed to be unique per-system.
If you just need file integrity checking, the algorithm more-or-less takes
care of that.
I wouldn't use the md5 hash of the file's contents, if the contents are

Here's my cite on the CAST weakness:
If you're going to encrypt the summary file then you can store anything as
sensitive as the rest of your backup data in it...

Sounds like you might want an offline master key with a couple UIDs and
several subkeys.
Also if I didn't trust a system enough to use any secret key on it I
probably also would not want to expose decrypted messages to that system,
presuming the messages you receive have sensitive/important information in
Something to consider if you really have cause to not trust that computer
might be setting up a dedicated, air-gapped system for
