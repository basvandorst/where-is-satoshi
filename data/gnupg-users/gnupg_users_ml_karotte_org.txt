@_subject: Setting up SKS Keyserver 
I'm thinking about setting up an SKS Keyserver. My question is, is
there some sort of mailinglist or something where this is ontopic?
As I understand I would also be in need of some "gossip" partners.
Is  the software I want to use or is there
something else? The Documentation Wiki for sks seems to be offline...
Any pointers in the right direction would be appreciated.
Kind Regards,

@_subject: howto secure older keys after the recent attacks

regarding this, the Simtec Entropy Key  is
available for sale online since a few days ago. This is an USB
hardware entropy generator. Perhaps this would be something to
consider in your tests regarding quality and speed of entropy
Kind Regards,

I'm sorry,
somehow I mixed up this thread with one on gnupg-devel. Nevertheless
the key is a nice piece of hardware.
