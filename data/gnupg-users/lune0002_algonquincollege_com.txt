Hash: SHA1
Hi folks:
Loaded the 1.40a onto a system running win98se. When I open a
dos prompt directory and type gpg I still get the loading
iconv.dll error. Is there something I'm missing?

Hash: SHA1
Hi Folks:
Downloaded and installed what I thought was v1.4.0a but it is
still reporting 1.4.0 when I run a show version command. Also,
when I run a check trust function using GPGShell a file renaming
error comes up that the author suggested was a bug that was
supposed to be cleared up in v1.4.0a.
How do I confirm if I have the right version or not??

Thanks, all, for the assist on the version question and file
renaming error. Found I am, indeed, using v1.4.0a. The file
renaming error turned out to be me shooting myself in the foot
with inappropriate use of the keyring and secret-keyring
options. I only have one of each and so should not have be using
New problem. GPGShell has a window for reloading keys. It
flashes by with warnings about the no-show-photos option being
deprecated and providing helpful suggestions on alternates.
Moves too fast for me to catch what's written, but as it's a
warning it's probably harmless. Since I'm now aware that the
option is deprecated I'd like to shut that warning off without
resorting to hiding the window. Any suggestions??
