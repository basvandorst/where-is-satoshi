Noting your activities regarding the GNU Privacy Guard project, I wondered
to what extent you have considered the use of biometrics for strong user
authentication? You may like to take a look at my background information
and email me if you have any interesting ideas in this context - it would be
good to see something useful being developed under the free software
philosophy, although there are perhaps some caveats as to secure template
management (see the PKI page on avanti).
Kind regards to all
