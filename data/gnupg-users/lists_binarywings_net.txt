You can simply write the answers down like you would in an interactive
session with gpg. Then feed this file with `gpg --gen-key ... < file`
gpg just reads from standard input. There is no difference between a
user pressing return and a newline character in a text file.
If you want to generate multiple key from one file, try something like
`while gpg --gen-key ...; do true; done < file`
Hope this helps,
