@_subject: Where is gpgsm? 
I hate to ask such a trivial question, but I honestly cannot find it. Where can I get gpgsm? It is mentioned here and there, but I cannot find a download link. Is it only available via CVS checkout or something?

@_subject: gpg or gpgme? 
I have been charged with the task of creating a java wrapper API around When I saw that there was a shared library gpgme, and that it was in principle "made easy", I thought that the best thing to do would be to use JNI (Java native interface) to call routines in the gpgme shared library. However, once I realized that gpgme simply invokes in turn the gpg executable, and given the extreme PITA that working with JNI is, it now seems to be that the most appealing approach is just to use interprocess communication and invoke the gpg executable from java.
All that said, I would really appreciate any feedback on this topic. Are there advantages to using gpgme in this case that I am unaware of? I understand that, in principle, if you have other crypto engines/back-ends supported by gpgme, then an app that uses gpgme will automatically support those back-ends. But I don't think this is so important for us. Are there other aspects of this that I'm missing?
Best Regards,
Jonathan Revusky

@_subject: gpg or gpgme? 
I appreciate the tips, but we have looked at using cryptix and have run into limitations, particularly as regards memory usage when encrypting large files and are now thinking that it would be better to use the native compiled gnupg code. So, for now, the question is whether it would be better to invoke the gpg executable directly or to use the gpgme shared library via JNI.
