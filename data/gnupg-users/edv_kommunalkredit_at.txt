Betreff: [Announce] [security fix] Libgcrypt and GnuPG
While evaluating the "Get Your Hands Off My Laptop" [1] paper I missed to describe [2] a software combination which has not been fixed and is thus vulnerable to the attack described by the paper.  If you are using a GnuPG version with a *Libgcrypt version < 1.6.0*, it is possible to mount the described side-channel attack on Elgamal encryption subkeys.
To check whether you are using a vulnerable Libgcrypt version, enter
  gpg2 --version
on the command line; the second line of the output gives the Libgcrypt
  gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.25
  libgcrypt 1.5.3
In this example Libgcrypt is vulnerable.  If you see 1.6.0 or 1.6.1 you are fine.  GnuPG versions since 1.4.16 are not affected because they do not use Libgcrypt.
The recommendation is to update any Libgcrypt version below 1.6.0 to at least the latest version from the 1.5 series which is 1.5.4.  Updating to 1.6.1 is also possible but that requires to rebuild GnuPG.
Libgcrypt 1.5.4 has been released yesterday [3]; for convenience I include the download instructions below.  A CVE-id has not yet been assigned.
Many thanks to Daniel Genkin for pointing out this problem.

[1] [2] [3] Libgcrypt source code is hosted at the GnuPG FTP server and its mirrors as listed at  .  On the primary server the source tarball and its digital signature are:
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.bz2 (1478k)  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.bz2.sig
That file is bzip2 compressed.  A gzip compressed version is here:
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.gz (1763k)  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.gz.sig
Alternativley you may upgrade using this patch file:
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.5.3-1.5.4.diff.bz2 (17k)
In order to check that the version of Libgcrypt you are going to build is an original and unmodified one, you can do it in one of the following
 * Check the supplied OpenPGP signature.  For example to check the
   signature of the file libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.bz2 you would use this
   command:
     gpg --verify libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.bz2.sig
   This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.  You
   should see a message indicating that the signature is good and made
   by the release signing key 4F25E3B6 which is certified by my well
   known key 1E42B367.  To retrieve the keys you may use the command
   "gpg --fetch-key finger:wk at g10code.com".
 * If you are not able to use GnuPG, you have to verify the SHA-1
   checksum:
     sha1sum libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.bz2
   and check that the output matches the first line from the
   following list:
bdf4b04a0d2aabc04ab3564fbe38fd094135aa7a  libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.bz2 71e432e0ae8792076a40c6059667997250abbb9d  libgcrypt-1.5.4.tar.gz 8876ae002751e6ec26c76e510d17fc3e0eccb3ed  libgcrypt-1.5.3-1.5.4.diff.bz2
Watching out for possible security problems and working with researches to fix them takes a lot of time.  g10 Code GmbH, a German company owned and headed by me, is bearing these costs.  To help us carry on this work, we need your support; please see  .

Betreff: [Announce] The sixth Beta for GnuPG 2.1 is now available for testing
I just released the sixth *beta* version of GnuPG *2.1*.  It has been released to give you the opportunity to check out new features and to help fixing bugs.
  If you need a stable and fully maintained version of GnuPG,
  you should use version 2.0.26 or 1.4.18.
This versions is marked as BETA and as such it should in general not be used for real work.  However, the core functionality is solid enough for a long time and I am using this code base for a couple of years now.
What's new in 2.1.0-beta783 since beta751 =========================================
 * gpg: Add command --quick-gen-key.
 * gpg: Make --quick-sign-key promote local key signatures.
 * gpg: Added "show-usage" sub-option to --list-options.
 * gpg: Screen keyserver responses to avoid importing unwanted keys
   from rogue servers.
 * gpg: Removed the option --pgp2 and --rfc1991 and the ability to
   create PGP-2 compatible messages.
 * gpg: Removed options --compress-keys and --compress-sigs.
 * gpg: Cap attribute packets at 16MB.
 * gpg: Improved output of --list-packets.
 * gpg: Make with-colons output of --search-keys work again.
 * gpgsm: Auto-create the ".gnupg" directory like gpg does.
 * agent: Fold new passphrase warning prompts into one.
 * scdaemon: Add support for the Smartcard-HSM card.
 * scdaemon: Remove the use of the pcsc-wrapper.
Getting the Software
GnuPG 2.1.0-beta783 is available at
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/unstable/gnupg-2.1.0-beta783.tar.bz2
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/unstable/gnupg-2.1.0-beta783.tar.bz2.sig
and soon on all mirrors .
Please read the README file !
Checking the Integrity
In order to check that the version of GnuPG which you are going to install is an original and unmodified one, you can do it in one of the following ways:
 * If you already have a trusted version of GnuPG installed, you
   can simply check the supplied signature.  For example to check the
   signature of the file gnupg-2.1.0-beta783.tar.bz2 you would use
   this command:
     gpg --verify gnupg-2.1.0-beta783.tar.bz2.sig
   Depending on your installation you may use "gpg2" instead of "gpg".
   This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.  You
   should see a message indicating that the signature is good and made
   by that signing key.  Make sure that you have the right key, either
   by checking the fingerprint of that key with other sources or by
   checking that the key has been signed by a trustworthy other key.
   Note, that you can retrieve the signing key using the command
     finger wk ,at' g10code.com
   or using a keyserver like
     gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 4F25E3B6
   The distribution key 4F25E3B6 is signed by the well known key
   1E42B367.
   NEVER USE A GNUPG VERSION YOU JUST DOWNLOADED TO CHECK THE
   INTEGRITY OF THE SOURCE - USE AN EXISTING GNUPG INSTALLATION!
The file gnupg.info has the complete user manual of the system.
Separate man pages are included as well; however they have not all the details available in the manual.  It is also possible to read the complete manual online in HTML format at
  The chapters on gpg-agent, gpg and gpgsm include information on how to set up the whole thing.  You may also want search the GnuPG mailing list archives or ask on the gnupg-users mailing lists for advise on how to solve problems.  Many of the new features are around for several years and thus enough public knowledge is already available.
Almost all mail clients support GnuPG-2.  Mutt users may want to use the configure option "--enable-gpgme" during build time and put a "set use_crypt_gpgme" in ~/.muttrc to enable S/MIME support along with the reworked OpenPGP support.
Please consult the archive of the gnupg-users mailing list before reporting a bug .
We suggest to send bug reports for a new release to this list in favor of filing a bug at .  We also have a dedicated service directory at:
  Maintaining and improving GnuPG is costly.  For more than a decade,
g10 Code GmbH, a German company owned and headed by GnuPG's principal author Werner Koch, is bearing the majority of these costs.  To help them carry on this work, they need your support.  See
  For reasons why donating to free software projects is beneficial for everyone, please read Poul-Henning Kamp's "Quality Software Costs Money
- Heartbleed Was Free" at  .
We have to thank all the people who helped with this release, be it testing, coding, translating, suggesting, auditing, administering the servers, spreading the word, and answering questions on the mailing lists.
