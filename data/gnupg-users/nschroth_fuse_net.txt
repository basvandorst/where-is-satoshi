When I ENcrypt on BoxA using -r UserName, decryption on BoxB errors with :
"decryption failed: secret key not available".
However, doing the same test using the email address associated with the
recipient, Decryption WORKS.
Can anyone offer some reasons for this?  Did we gen or export or import the
key incorrectly?

On the target (recipient) machine:
  --list-keys shows my Primary Key, My desktop Key and a co-worker's desktop
  --list-secret-keys shows only my Primary Ke
  --list-keys PrimaryKeyUserName it only lists my primary key.
This has happen when a file was encrypted from EITHER my desktop or
mycoworker's desktop.

Interesting. The key is not listed twice, but...
--list-keys PrimaryUserName shows ALL THREE keys while
--list-keys PrimaryEmailAddress shows only the primary host key.
Could it be that the name I used for the primary key was CompanyName  and
the email addresses for all the people had that as their domain (ex:
Bill at companyname.com) ???
