@_subject: smartcard V1.1 and 2048 RSA 
Hello list,
is it possible to create one single RSA-2048 key on a openPGP smartcard
v1.1 instead of a key with 2 or 3 1024-RSA subkeys?
Thank you!

I?d like to play with libpampoldi, but can?t find it nowhere.
Has poldi been abandoned or is it still under some development?
Does it at least get the serious flaws fixed, if still under deleopmnet?
best regards

@_subject: disabled keys 
if a key is disabled, does that prevent operations that are applied on
the whole key ring?
E.g. does --refresh-keys skip disabled keys?
