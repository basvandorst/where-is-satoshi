@_subject: gen-key non-interactively 
I'm wanting to pass all of the information that gpg needs to create a
key (key size, type, expiration, userid, etc) initially and not have
gpg keep pausing to ask the user.  I've read the man page, read gpg
--help, googled, and I still cant figure out how to pass those things
to gpg while using --gen-key.  Any help would be *greatly*
Thank you,
Mark Pinto
