@_subject: GnuPG 1.2.5 + EudoraGPG 2.0/Enigmail 0.85.0 Broken? 
Hash: RIPEMD160
My gpg.conf file is as follows:
cipher-algo TWOFISH
comment DC39 FB90 71FF F1F4 F235 8482 E65C E36B BE90 8723
default-key BA907EB4
default-recipient foo
digest-algo RIPEMD160
keyring gnupg-ring:A:\Rings\Default\pubring.gpg
secret-keyring gnupg-ring:A:\Rings\Default\secring.gpg
s2k-cipher-algo TWOFISH
The conf file works *fine* w/ (GnuPG 1.2.4 + EudoraGPG 2.0 + Eudora
6.1.2) *and* (GnuPG 1.2.4 + Enigmail 0.85.0 + Thunderbird 0.7+). The use
of GnuPG 1.2.5, however kicks back unsupported options errors with both
of the previously mentioned plugin/client combos. Registry were updated
accordingly (gpgProgram="C:\1.2.4" and gpgProgram="C:\1.2.5"). Is 1.2.5
broken? Or have the options listed in my gpg.conf file been deprecated?
