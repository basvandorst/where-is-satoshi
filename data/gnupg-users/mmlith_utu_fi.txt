@_subject: Updating GnuPG to 1.4.9 
Hi there!
I'm running GnuPG on Windows and I would like to update my old GnuPG to
newer version, 1.4.9. How can I do it so, that I can still use my existing
keys? I tried quick-and-dirty method in my test machine and copy-pasted only
new exe-files to my old gnupg-folder. Obviously it didn't work, because I
couldn't find any keys when running --list-keys.. So does anyone know how to
update correctly? Thanks!
