@_subject: writing --import output to stdout 
I could redirect stderr to stdout, but its not an option here.
I want to collect the stats produced by --import and possibly
the fingerprint of the newly added key to be add data directly
into the database.
I tried --status-fd, but it doesn't work.
Any ideas?
Thank you.
