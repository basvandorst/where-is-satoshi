@_subject: gnupg, news and Signature Verify 
I try to establish a way to sign my NewsPostings and - more
interesting - also to verify the messages posted by other people.
Since I am using new keys, the digest algorithm is SHA1 - which I
also use. But gpg seem to have a problem with the signed message (I
can not see why).
I have put the message on  to
verify for everyone. When I do a "gpg --verify --verbose", I get the
$ gpg --verbose --verify newssig.asc
gpg: armor header: Version: GnuPG-v1.4.1
gpg: original file name=''
gpg: Signature made Thu Mar  2 14:44:15 2006 CET using DSA key ID 0B707552
gpg: WARNING: signature digest conflict in message
gpg: Can't check signature: general error
pgpdump sais that the digest-algorithm is SHA1 and valid:
$ pgpdump newssig.asc
        Pub alg - DSA Digital Signature Algorithm(pub 17)
Can anyone tell me why gpg sees a digest conflict in that message?
I'd understand if the signature would be bad or wrong, but
apparently it can not check wether the signature is valid.
Ciao, Hanno
