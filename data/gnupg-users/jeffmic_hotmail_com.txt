@_subject: gpg.exe Command Line - check if file is already encrypted 
I'm using the following command line:
C:\"Program Files (x86)"\GNU\GnuPG\pub\gpg.exe --batch -v -r "MyEVU" -o
"c:\users\anonymoose\desktop\test.pdf.gpg" -e
Encryption works fine.
I'm trying to figure out how to use the gpg.exe to check if the file is
encrypted.  In my example above, the obvious answer that the new
test.pdf.gpg is encrypted.  However, I'm also going to be given a set of
files that won't have the gpg extension, and I won't know if they are
already encrypted using that MyEVU key.
Is there a command line option/syntax that would just return information
telling me the file is already encrypted?
Much appreciated, y'all.

That command encrypts the files correctly and the new test.pdf.gpg file is
created successfully.

I do not have whatever is necessary to un-encrypt the files encrypted by
that MyEVU key, and I don't care if the file was encrypted using that key or
not.  I only need to know if the file is encrypted at all.
