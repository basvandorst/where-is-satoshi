@_subject: Weird locale at passphrase step 
I have just installed GnuPG on macOS Mojave using Homebrew. When I try to
generate a new key I can go through almost all steps seeing messages and
dialogs in English, but when it asks my passphrase, I see:

My GnuPG version and locale:
$ gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.13
libgcrypt 1.8.4
$ echo $LANGUAGE
$ locale
How do I fix this?

That command fixed it! Thanks a lot!
Still curious how it picked up the other locale... I do have russian layout
as one of the input sources but have never set locale to ru and the system
was always in English.
In some cases the agent shows another dialog that is half-english and
half-broken-cyrillic. Very weird.
