@_subject: gpg import problem 
I am trying to import a valid pubkey type, created on a MAC, using
the latest freeware version of PGP.  I am using gpg version 1.0.5 on a
machine.  What is wrong and how can I get this to work?
The following is the command and error message:
  pgp> gpg --import CrusoKey
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: read_block: read error: invalid packet
gpg: import from `CrusoKey' failed: invalid keyring
gpg: Total number processed: 0
I received the publickey from a zip drive and
moved it to the unix machine, from my pc, via binary ftp.
