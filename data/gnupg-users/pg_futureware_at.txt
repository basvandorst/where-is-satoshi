@_subject: why cissp says this about PGP/GnuPG? 
Are there any facts or reasons against CISSP?
Are there any alternatives?
My personal opinion is that PGP was designed to protect normal confidential data, not to protect spy information. Spy communication has more demand for steganography (making sure that you don?t even notice the transmission and not just that you can?t read it), and less demand for "public" key systems ;-)
Perhaps it is also means that you should not use PGP, but GnuPG instead, because of the --hidden-recipient function in GnuPG (which is missing in PGP, if I am not mistaken), which is also an essential feature for spies.

@_subject: importing preference changes 
I imported a DSA-1024-160 testkey into GnuPG, and got the following message:
gpg --homedir work/696/ --import work/696/request.key
 Set preference list to:
      Cipher: AES256, AES192, AES, CAST5, 3DES
      Digest: SHA1, SHA256, RIPEMD160
      Compression: ZLIB, BZIP2, ZIP, Uncompressed
      Features: MDC, Keyserver no-modify
 Really update the preferences? (y/N)          I am a bit puzzled that importing a key makes gnupg ask me, whether I want to update my preferences ...
I have the feeling that this could be a security risk, if it changed the preferences in an insecure way ...
Why doesn?t it show the previous settings, so that I know what it actually Best regards,

Which version of OpenPGP signature format is being used by GnuPG 1.4.1?
Is it always version 4 signatures?
Does it depend on the key?

@_subject: renewing of expired signatures 
============================== START ==============================
GnuPG has problems renewing expired signatures on keys, when the old signature (that already expired) is still on the key. The old expired signature is still on the key, and a new signature isn?t done when trying to renew it.
The workaround is to manually remove the old signature before creating a new Is this a bug or an intended feature?

@_subject: UID management 
I am missing the GPGME manual on the website:
Does GPGME have UID management functionality? I would need deluid to delete UIDs from keys, and I can?t find it in the When I do gpg --with-colons $file then I get a list of UIDs in that file.
When I do a fresh gpg --import $file and then a gpg --edit-key $uid then I also get a list of those UIDs.
But that list is ordered differently.
Why is it ordered differently?
How are both lists ordered?
Best regards,
Philipp G?hring

@_subject: UID management 
Thanks for your answer!
Ok, I need the following: 1. I need a tool that lists me all the UIDs in a key. 2. Then I select the UIDs I need, and the UIDs I do not need
3. Then I need a tool that removes all selected unneeded UIDs from the key, and returns me the stripped key.
Until now I tried the do the first step with gpg --with-colons and the third step with gpg --edit-key by automating gpg. But due to the ordering problem, this doesn?t work.
How likely will it be that such an implementation will break with the next version? It doesn?t sounds like a stable, robust and secure way to me.
You mean an implementation bug? Or is there some structural problem that doesnt allow for a robust ordering? Are you sorting the UIDs while importing them for faster lookup? Aren?t you just copying the public key into the keyring directly?
Why isn?t it order just in the same way it is written in the file? Why is it reordered at all? Why isn?t the ordering configurable?
How can I specify it then?
Is that an issue that should be solved in the OpenPGP standard? Can you write a proposal that would suit it?
Ok, which solution can you suggest?

@_subject: UID management 
Hi David,
Thanks a lot!  That looked like a good solution.
Unfortuntely, it doesn?t work for the UID that is attached to the public key:
Then I get this list:
[ultimate] (1). test
[ultimate] (2)  test
And I can happily select and deselect the UID 2:
uid 5F6CE18A5E1C698C9F6AED4BD3D9AABC6948BC1F
pub  1024D/DD2C60F4  created: 2007-09-29  expires: niemals     usage: CS
                     trust: uneingeschr?nkt G?ltigkeit: uneingeschr?nkt
sub  2048g/4DD86652  created: 2007-09-29  expires: niemals     usage: E
[ultimate] (1). test
[ultimate] (2)* test
But I can?t select the first one:
uid A591FD39DD2C60F4
does nothing.
Any ideas?
Best regards,
Philipp G?hring

@_subject: Safe decryption with GnuPG? 
Use a full-disc encryption system for all your persistent media.
You can use TaintedBochs or TaintedQemu to investigate that.
Doesn?t help much to try that, I would say. But feel free to try ...
You need a Do-What-I-Mean system for that.
Use Overlay mode to display it.
Implement the viewer in the graphic card, with the CUDA SDK or something Overlay mode does that.
I don?t understand why you need that. I would suggest that you seperate the small chunks into seperated encrypted files, to ensure that the reader only gets those chunks that you actually I think your specification isn?t complete yet. You forgot about half of the I guess that:
* You want a machine that seperates code from data (to be secure against  trojans, virii and other malware)
* You want secure documents, that can?t change dynamically, or otherwise contain invisible contents
* You want a secure path to the user
(and some more requirements that I forgot at the moment)
What?s your budget for this small project?

OpenOffice uses XML-DSig, not S/Mime. The PDF Format uses PKCS not S/Mime. XML-DSig, PKCS and S/Mime are all using X.509 certificates.

@_subject: Series of minor questions about OpenPGP 5 
Yes, I agree. I haven't discovered any intelligent algorithms yet, only
statistical tests seem to be available.
If anyone knows better tests, please let me know.
(I am currently working to add better statistical tests, but they will
still be statistical tests, nothing groundbreaking)
We have successfully discovered a weak RNG, notified the vendor and got
the vendor to actually fix the product. So I would say that it actually
makes sense to do it, to detect weak RNGs.
An actual counter-example to this claim is the Debian-OpenSSL bug.
OpenSSL processed the random numbers through a hash, but it still showed
statistical weaknesses on the hash digest output.

Philipp G?hring
