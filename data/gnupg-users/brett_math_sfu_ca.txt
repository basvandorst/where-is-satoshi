@_subject: no valid OpenPGP data found??? 
please CC   replies to this message to me since I am not a subscriber to
this list.
A friend sent me a key that he had generated with gpg 1.0.4
the email he sent me is at the end of this message.
When I try to import it I get
[brett brett]$ gpg -v --import temptrev
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
I think this must be something very simple and straightforward but
I have not been able to find an answer on the faq nor by searching the
mailing list archives?
