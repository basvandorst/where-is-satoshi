GNU-PG's FAQ claims that RSA support is included since gnupg-1.0.3.
However, I have tried both gnupg-1.0.3 and the most recent
gnupg-1.0.4, neither can decrypt message encrypted by PGP using RSA.
For example, here is a sample message I got (even after I imported all
PGP keys into GNU-PG):
$ gpg encrypted-by-pgp-rsa.pgp
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: protection algorithm 1 is not supported
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID 5A66A2A1, created 2000-10-29
      "jiejun"
gpg: public key decryption failed: unknown cipher algorithm
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
Here is what gnupg-1.0.4 claims in its NEWS file:
    * RSA is supported. Key generation does not yet work but will come
      soon.
I can bear the "key generation does not yet work" part.  However, if
RSA encryption/decryption also does not work, then what does "RSA is
supported" mean?
Anybody has luck in this case?  Or the FAQ and NEWS file are dishonest?
Best Regards,

Thank both of you.  Actually I was just trying to use GDB to trace RSA
decryption in GNU-PG, now I've got it.   However, I am still not
convinced by the relationship between IDEA and RSA in GNU-PG.  Are you
people available to illustrate this part?  Why do I have to integrate
IDEA before I can use RSA?  From GDB I saw that decryption is done by
rsa.c:secret() function, I don't see IDEA has any business there.

Ok, perhaps I've got it.
So it is PGP who relates IDEA and RSA together. In GNU-PG, IDEA and
RSA are independently handled.
Thanks a lot,

Hi, Nils,
I reread my first message and do see something offensive there.  Here
I applogize for the comments I made to your efforts on gpg's FAQ.
On the other hand, in the section "Decrypting a PGP 2.x document" of
 there is no description about
what I was just told.  I guess the "gpg" program used in the example
has an IDEA module integrated.  However, the "gpg" program made from
standard release doesn't have this feature, so maybe it is better to
add more comments in the section "Decrypting a PGP 2.x document" of
next release.
Best Regards,
