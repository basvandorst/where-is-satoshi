@_subject: one key or multiple keys 
This question came up recently:
Should I use only ONE key for every email address I have
(with multiple IDs, eg. Marcin Gil , Marcin Gil )
or should I use multiple keys -- one for every email address?

Hi there!
Considering all your opinions I did something like this:
- revoked my key  and sent a revcert to keyserver.net.
- deleted a signature of  from my second (thus now primary) key I've sent updated  key to keyserver.net. Boom. There are
two self-signatures of  and I don't know why.
I've messed something up and don't know what.. please explain.
I can revcert the key, since only 1 or 2 people got it.

Next matter:
- use the same key for email and jabber account
- or gen special key just for use with jabber account.

I was thinking (and tried to) about doing such sequence:

============================== START ==============================
So many answers! Guys you are *fantastic*!
What I did was:
- I have all my --armor exports of all the steps of   key creation process: genkey, adduid, addphoto.
  After each step I exported both public and secret key
  to the ascii file (just to be sure).
- deleted all keyrings.
- imported a pubkey of step 2 (genkey + adduid)
- exported it to keyserver.net
- imported final keys.
This way anyone can get my key..
But I got a question: what happens when one signs such
a pubkey and I refresh it from the keyserver?
