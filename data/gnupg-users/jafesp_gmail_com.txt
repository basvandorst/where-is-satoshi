Hi everyone.
I want to open a file called passwords.txt.gpg and editing it
directly.   The mentioned file holds a password list and I prefer not
to decrypt it, that is, I want to read it directly in gpg format
I believe it is possible reading, editing and writing directly in gpg
file format itself without decrypting it, provided that GnuPG itself
does the same thing on the public keyring (pubring.gpg), on the secret
keyring (secring.gpg) and on the trust database (trustdb.gpg).
I hope I had made myself clear enought.
Best regards.
