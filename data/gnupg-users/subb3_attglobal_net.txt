@_subject: GPG and mail 
I have been reading through the GPG manual and it explains the
primary use of the GPG for signing files/documents. How can I use
GPG to sign email or encrypt email?
Thank you in advance.

@_subject: Insecure memory 
I am trying to look at a file that has been signed. When I execute
"gpg -d ", I get the following message,
(0)subb3 => gpg -d file.gpg
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
The other user accounts do not have this problem. I have terminated the
current xterm and started a new xterm. The problem still continues each
time I try to decrypt a file.
Any insights into this error appreciated.
Thank you in advance.

The version of GPG is 1.0.2 and I do not see "--no-secmem-warning" as an
option. The man page does list this option. The command line "gpg -?" does
not list this option.

I am talking about the command line options for the "gpg" command. The
man page may be uniform across different versions.
Here is the output of "gpg -?" (I have cropped out the initial few lines)
I do not see a --no-secmem-warning option.

Thank you very much for this solution! The setuid flag has fixed the "insecure
memory" problem.

Are there public key servers for GNU PG? If yes, then
where do I find a listing of these servers?
Thank you in advance.

@_subject: Email authentication?? 
I have sucessfully installed GPG on my linux system and generated
the keys of myself. One of my users has genrated his set of keys
too. How can I authenticate the mail from this user, when he sends
it while away from the office? I would not know which client or OS
he would be using to send mail. Once I receive the mail, I need to
verify that it's from him. If anyone else is trying to authenticate
an email, please let me know how you are doing it.
Thank you in advance.

@_subject: GPG on different machines 
I have installed GPG on 2 different machines. The different user accounts on these
machines are identical. Very likely, I plan to have 2 sets of keys for each user account,
one for each machine. Are there any good practices regarding the number of keys a user
may have?
Once the keys are generated, where do I keep the public key? Is there a public
server for the GPG public keys?
Thank you in advance.

@_subject: Exchanging with PGP users 
I am looking for any information that can allow GnuPG and PGP users to exchange
information securely. Is there any plugin or so for GnuPG to send PGP users
messages? Some of my friends are well trenched into PGP and shrug off GnuPG.
How can I read their messages sent to me? I have GnuPG 1.0.4.
Thank you in advance for any help.
