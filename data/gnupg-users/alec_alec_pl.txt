When to use quotes in user identifiers if at all?
According to RFC4880 and RFC2822 quotes should be used in some cases,
but it looks that gpg does not use them when expected.

@_subject: Key import issues 
A few users have (different) problems with importing secret keys
generated by OpenPGP.js. For me it works. Could anyone explain why gpg
exits with code 2 and what exactly these errors mean?
(gnupg 2.0.28 in this case)
