Who is your hosting provider? Do they have gpg already installed on their systems for you to use? I don't think you will be allowed to install software onto their computers ... Do you have SSH access to your account on your hosting provider? If so, you can try "which gpg" and see what you get back.

What's wrong with just --export ing the public/private keys, and importing them into win2000?

@_subject: Help with encrypting using my PGP Public key 
Not really. It just bits n bytes. Anything gpg takes in as input (files, plaintext, whatever) it just happily signs and/or encrypts. If you are emailing the output directly (copy paste) you should "--armor" the output, to prevent mailers destroying your "text." OTOH, you could just 'attach' the file (binary, ascii armored, or otherwise) as a regular email attachment and send it that way. As others have said, encrypting mail has been made trivially easy with tools such as Kmail and Enigmail. When you desire to encrypt a file (say a JPEG, or PDF), you may probably need to throw in some commands on a command-line interface.

@_subject: Subkeys... 
Sorry about that. My comment below should contain the URL for the key. I still new to this, and weary about uploading my public key on keyservers. Last time I did that (the first time ever) i didn't create a revocation cert, and I lost/forgot my password. They will expire I think in one year (at public key server) but I'm afraid I might doing something wrong and much the whole thing up. That's why I just host my pub key at my site.
AND this discussion of reliable and fast key servers has got me nervous

Somewhat humourously, my public key is now up on all the public key servers! I guess I'll have to live with all that spam .. .. ..
(can't sign this msg - Outlook express sucks, i use Kmail regularly, and don't want to bother customising my windows and "getting used to it." bad idea, no TB for me thanks)

My web host has gnupg 1.2.6 on their machines. I often SSH into it  when I am not at home on my gnulinux box. Anything I should be concerned about when using this version? the two key pairs I made (DSS signing, ELG encryption) were made on gnupg 2.0.9, and transfered (and imported) to this host via SSH.

You must sign that recipient's public key with your private key. Do this only after verifying that the public key does indeed belong to the intended recipeint. For example, don't blindly sign a key that says bill.gates at microsoft.com is you are not sure that the key belongs to Bill Gates. It may belong to "me" and I will have the private key to decrypt any messages that you send (of course, I do not have an email address at domain microsoft.com). Also, if you choose "file" (as you have in your script) there is no need to provide standard input (as you wrote <

@_subject: Public Key not found. 
When I started out with gpg, I created and destroyed many private keys. i was very careful not to use them seriously, only to mess with on my private home suse box. I didn't upload them, and I didn't sign any documents with them. I didn't share them with anybody. I destroyed many, and made new ones, until I was comfortable with how gpg worked, and how (a)symmetric crypto works, etc.
Hopefully you have not uploaded your public key to a public keyserver. To delete your own private/public keys try [gpg --delete-secret-and-
public-key youremail at address.com]

@_subject: problems with PGP/MIME 
I will do my best to describe as succinctly and clearly as possible. To
begin, I use openSUSE, openoffice for documents, and [usually] kmail for
email. I created a document in OOo and clicked on the 'email' button to
send it to my "other" email address xx at student.qut.edu.au [backup]. I sent
the file signed and encrypted. The other address has only a web interface,
and as such, has no support for PGP/MIME. As expected, I see two
attachments, application/pgp-encrypted "VERSION 1" file, and
application/octet-stream (my encrypted .odt file). It isn't actually
binary, it appeares in ASCII when downloaded and opened in text editor. I
ran it through Kgpg, and also separately through gpg command line, and was
disappointed that I did not recover my original .odt file.
The top portion contains email header information stuff (stuff I don't
want, or care to understand). There is a signature at the very bottom, but
verification fails (it is *my*own* pub/priv key pair). In the middle,
above the signature, and below the email header stuff, there is an
ascii-armoured portion of data. I have not yet attempted to select it all,
copy, paste, decrypt, because I thought to myself, "there must be a better
(read: easier) way to do this..." So, is there?
I forwarded the message back to my xx at felipe1982.com address, and viewed
it in kmail (which as you all know, supports cool things like pgp/mime).
But it (after submitting my passphrase) will not decrypt!
Is this the normal behaviour of pgp/mime. I did read a little (albeit
quickly and not in detail) of rfc3156 (is this the most recent?).
Any ideas, suggestions, comments appreciated. Thanks.

I assume[d] (maybe incorrectly?) that clients without support for pgp/mime would still be able to manually extract/download the attachments and manually decrypt them and reliably open, read and change them. Does the RFC allow for 'legacy' email clients to still read/decrypt attachments as normal?

As it turns out, the attachment was base64 encoded, and the code you asked me to run worked correctly and the file opened beautifully in Ooo again!
I restared Kmail, and this time it __did__ decrypt the message (it had failed to do this earlier). All-in-all, clients without pgp/mime are a PITA. Use ascii armour or encrypt attachments before attaching (not encryption after attaching as in pgp/mime.)
