The latest versions of The Bat! include GnuPG support (from v1.53).

This is a reported bug in GnuPG which remains unfixed and relates to
the use of GnuPG on Win2k. I have also reported this problem and even
taken the time to capture and submit a TCP log trace to be told "No, I
don't carry a Windows box with me around ;-)" when asking about a
possible fix for it :-(.

This seems to correspond to an "INVALID PARAMETER" standard Win32
error code. I don't know if that might help with the diagnosis of the

anywhere near the keyserver. The ec=97 response is instantaneous.

Anything on that EC87 error with keyserver lookup on Win2k? Did the
TDIMON trace help at all? Anything else we can do out in the field?

While that may be true, it is what nearly all major MUAs in Windows
do. That includes Outlook, OE and Eudora. That's got to be 80% of all
windows MUAs. I hasten to add that I use The Bat! which *doesn't* do
this and wraps only during message creation.

Certainly post 2.x then, but in all versions since at least 6.0 AFAICS.

GnuPGShell is as free as any item for which no charge is levied. It is
as free as anything that is given away for nothing. It is free. Beer
is not free. You have to pay money for it (even if you make it
yourself). GnuPGShell is free. Werner is mistaken.
DS> Most people out of the W32-world don't understand that,
Duh! The GPL world seems to have stolen the word "FREE" and given it a
whole new meaning which puts a price on its head and corrupts the
whole ethos. There is no monopoly on the word "free" and its meaning.
There is only the dictionary definition. My use of Win32 and your
advocacy of the GPL does not place any rights to abuse that word.
DS> but the FREE Software is much more than just 'cheap'!!!
Exactly. GnuPGShell is free by the dictionary definition. Werner
should apologize to Roger for his misunderstanding and commend him for
his tireless and unrewarded (and now unfairly maligned) efforts to
make GPG accessible to Win32 users.
I remained silent to this point because Werner had only decried
GnuPGShell for being proprietary. That is true. It bears a copyright
When Werner said it was *not free*, that is a fallacious statement
that must be corrected.
