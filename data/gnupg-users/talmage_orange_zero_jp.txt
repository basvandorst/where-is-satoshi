@_subject: OpenPGP-Card2.0 and Omnikey Cardman 3021? 
Werner, thanks for the response.
I figured it was a problem with the Omnikey, so I went ahead and got a  SCR335, only to find out that it gives the same exact error when  generating keys on the card...  I'm starting to wonder if this is some  kind of USB issue with Mac OS Snow Leopard.
My system is a Mac OS X 10.6 system, with gnupg 1.4.10, and  OpenPGPCard v2.0.
I read somewhere that the SCR335 needs the newest firmware, so updated  firmware to 5.23, but still the same problem.
Again, here is the output.
Any clues as to what might be causing this?
Has anyone successfully used the OpenPGPCard v2.0 on Snow Leopard?

@_subject: OpenPGP-Card2.0 and Omnikey Cardman 3021? 
Has anyone gotten the Omnikey Cardman 3021 to work with the internal  I'm having trouble getting it to work properly.
I know, I should've just bought the SCM SCR335, but this Cardman 3021  looks better and was cheap. ;)
The --card-status works great, and so I had thought all was good till  I tried generating keys on it.
Every other command I tried worked fine.
I'm on a Mac OS X 10.6 system, with OpenPGPCard v2.0.
I've got rid of the ifd-ccid.bundle as recommended on another thread  in this list, so I'm pretty sure it's using the gnupg internal driver.
I've tried with gnupg 1.4.10 and 2.0.12, and both fail on 'generate'
Here's the output for gnupg 1.4.10 (sorry, it's really long)
Thanks in advance.

@_subject: OpenPGPCard Max PIN length changes? 
Is this not the case with the newer v2.0 cards?  My v2.0 card shows Max.
PIN lengths .: 32 32 32.
Is this a setting that can be changed?  I didn't see anything in
card-edit, and have I been digging around online, but have not come up
with an answer.
If in fact there was a change from v1.1/254 to v2.0/32, is there a
reason for this change?
Anyway to use longer PINs on the v2.0 cards?
