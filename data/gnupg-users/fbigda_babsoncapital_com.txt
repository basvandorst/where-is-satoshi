I've been researching and I can't seem to determine what the problem is with the key.  It appears to have a bad signature?  I imported the key and do an edit check:
C:\GnuPG>gpg --import xx.asc
gpg: key F867286A: public key "Named File Transfer" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
C:\GnuPG>gpg --edit-key F867286A

Command> check
uid  Named File Transfer
sig!        F867286A 2004-11-09   [self-signature]
1 signature not checked due to a missing key
The problem is that even if I follow through and TRUST it anyway, when I try to decrypt a file from them I get an error: "mpi too large".  I don't know if the problems are even related.
I've been working on this guy for some time now.  If there anyone that can help?  Thank you

They are using PGP Ver. 7.0.1

Probably unrelated.  The "signature not checked" is not an error, but
normal operation: the key you imported has a signature from a key you
don't have.  It's just a note so you can go out and get this other key
if you care.
The "mpi too large" is a problem, but likely on the sender side.  Do
you know what program they are using to encrypt?
