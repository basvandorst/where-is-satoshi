@_subject: GPGME support for key preferences 
Hello *,
I am interested in a way of obtaining key preferences information using GPGME API. Being more specific, my target is represented by the last 4 lines of the output of the command "gpg -edit-key  showpref", the cipher, digest, compression and features lines. Is it even possible to obtain such information with GPGME or should I consider parsing the above command output?
Thank you for your time,
Gabriel Mahu
