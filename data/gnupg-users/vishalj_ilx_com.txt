@_subject: SCO 3 Compilation 
Did anyone compiled GPG 1.0.6 on SCO3? I got following problems.
*	I have to disable assembly by --disable-asm as gcc/egcs was not able
to compile it.
*	I got problem with "remove" in code, so I have to replace it with
*	Now I am stuck at Unix Domain Sockets. As I know SCO3 does not

If anyone has got these troubles and was able to compile if finally, please
let me know what you did.
