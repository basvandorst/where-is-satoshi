@_subject: decrypting a file with passphrase in the command as an option 
I am trying to write a script to decrypt a file and would like to put the
passphrase in the decryption command so I won't be prompted for it.  For
gpg -o test.txt -d test.asc
please enter passphrase> ******
and it works
I would like to put the passphrase in the command so I wont be prompted for
it.  Can this be done?
