Hello Group
I'm a new user here :
How do I choose "No mail", web only option - for this list ?
2/ What are the most recommended Windows front ends for GnuPG
(Windows XP user) Is there a way to use the IDEA algorithm with GnuPG - if
so how ? [wish to be fully compatible with PGP users ]
4/ I presently use Pegasus for Windows as my e mail client.
Are there better free e mail clients - that integrate with
GPG especially ?
I'm presently forced to use PGP mainly for Nym and Re-mailer
messages. Presently I'm using Jack B Nymble as my mail
client for Nym related mail. JBN seems to integrate ONLY
with PGP. Are there equivalent mail clients (that can
generate re-mailer and nym messages) which interface with
If anyone is using Jack B Nymble with GnuPg please let me
know - any tips / pointers are most welcome
any GnuPG equivalent for the PGPDisk ?

Hello group
Thanks for the responses. I've downloaded GPG and
installed the same. - - Since I don't have an earlier installation of *trusted GPG*             and - - couldn't succeed with the MD5sum command, I haven't
  verified the signatures.
So If someone can help me with the verification of
signatures, I'd be grateful
Though I've been using PGP for a short while, I've never
checked detached signatures. I've installed GPG and GPG shell in a temporary directory
(to test out till I verify signatures). I hope I can un-
install and re install GPG / shell, if need be (if the
signature check end up bad)
I've imported public / private keys from PGP using GPGKeys
I can see the keys when I start GPGKeys (though I
see each key repeated in two lines)
When I try to encrypt files using GPGtools, I get to
select the file(to be encrypted), but when the " GPG Tools - Encrypt " window opens up, I don't see any public keys in the dialog box What I've checked so far

Hash: SHA1
Hi folks :
One more question that I did not add to my earlier mail...
How do I delete a post that I sent to this list (if need
be ?)
for e.g. I've mentioned the full e mail address for my key
- - autoresponder in the last post. I'd like to modify it as
usual.. talking away the @ and replacing it with the _at_
Can I do that ? If so how ?
thanks in advance

Dear Neil Thanks for this detailed response. A little confused here.
Is sign = Trust ? or Because when I use the "edit" function from GPG Keys
window, I get a help list, which has both sign and trust as
separate commands. Keys that I sign seem to be the ones I
am allowed to encrypt to ? (am I right there ?)
Not very sure of what you mean by trusting a key ?
Is this the same as trusting a person behind that key ?
Then  Oh ! no, there a are set of keys that I'd like to
encrypt to ...but I have no knowledge of the person bend
the key, either to trust them or ... NOT to trust them For e.g. a re-mailer key ...
I've explained my thoughts on siging, later in this post Lets say I've got some 500 Public keys on my PGP keyring
Lets say I may end up using some 100 of these public keys
pretty regularly - like Nym keys, re-mailer keys, list
member keys, news reporter's keys etc. Theoretically, in quite a few some cases, I'm not even expected to know who these people are and so the question of trusting or not trusting **the person** doesn't arise .. and a practical question ..
I have multiple private keys. Lets say I have key pars
a - used in office (in the Full name and office e mail id)
b - used for nym and re-mailers (with my nym address)
c - used in personal communications (with my short name
    and personal address)
How do I choose different private_ keys to sign
different public keys ? For e.g. my colleague's key with
_my_private_(a), a re-mailer ops key with _my_private_(b)
and my brother's key with _my_private__(c) and so on ?
Don't we import public keys - basically to encrypt to them
(i.e.) with an intention to use them. How else would a
public key get into my key ring ? (without me getting a
public key block and me importing it by certain willful
actions, without me searching the key servers and importing
etc.. etc..)
so why should I go through another process of signing a key ?
(i.e.) forgetting the cryptography involved behind the
process of signing, as a user, why should I do a second
action (call it signing or stamping or whatever **after** willfully importing a public key ?

Hello List members : Thanks for the patient response to my earlier questions
I might have missed answers to some questions from  these questions may have been left un answered I have multiple private keys. Lets say I have key pairs
a - used in office (in the Full name and office e mail id)
b - used for nym and re-mailers (with my nym address)
c - used in personal communications (with my short name
    and personal address)
How do I choose different private_ keys to sign
different public keys ? For e.g. my colleague's key with
_my_private_(a), a re-mailer ops key with _my_private_(b)
and my brother's key with _my_private__(c) and so on ?
Request you to post replies to above Thanks in advance
