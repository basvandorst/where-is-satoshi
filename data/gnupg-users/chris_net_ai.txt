@_subject: php encryption 
Hello  to everyone on the list, this is my first Gnupg post.
Has anyone managed to implement an encryption solution from PHP? I got stuck
at the need to pass the passphrase to the process. I tried "echo $pass |
gpgcommand" but it didn;t work.
What I am trying to do is to encrpyt a file (or a variable) from mod_php and
write it back to a file (or a variable). httpd will run as user httpd so I
have to run as gpg as another user, and encrpyt for the end user's public
Any help appreciated.

I'm still having problems getting this to work, even with the excellent
suggestions I have recieved from list members.
To take it down to baseics I hard coded everything.
Apache is running as apache, and I su'ed to apache and ran gpg -gen-key.
Then I imported the key username  tp the apache keyring and
signed it, and trusted it ""I trust fully".
The command I am using is
system("/usr/bin/gpg --encrypt --batch -ao 'test.gpg' -r 'username
' 'test.txt' ");
If I su to apache and run it form the command line, it works.
When I run the page that calls the command, it doesn't.
If I change the command to:
system("touch test.txt");
the file is created, so I know php has the right permissions to create a
I have checked /var/log/messages and /var/log/httpd/errors for errors, and I
don't see anything.
Can anyone shed any light on this?
