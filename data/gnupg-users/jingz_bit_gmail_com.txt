@_subject: What does the message mean while encrypting? 
I would encrypt one file by gpg.
After I execute following command line:
C:\WP_ECL~1.4\TESTCE~1>gpg -r Luna --encrypt test.txt
Following message pops up:
gpg: 07421961: There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user
pub  1024g/07421961 2008-07-26 Li Meng (Luna)  Primary key fingerprint: E36D 817B 1A23 17DB E93B  F0F3 5AE5 3D90 0F89 CA08
      Subkey fingerprint: AB25 B0F5 5E5F 8EC2 9C35  2557 4382 52A0 0742 1961
It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named
in the user ID.  If you *really* know what you are doing,
you may answer the next question with yes.
Use this key anyway? (y/N)
Now I have confirm a 'y' to complete the processing.
How can I execute the command without a confirm like above?

@_subject: How can I encrypt with a PGP pub key 
Is that impossible to encrypt with a PGP public key?
My PGP is FW 6.5.8, and I tested to import the public key to GPG, encrypt a
file with it, and decrypt the gpg file by PGP.
But the descryption seemed failed
Who knows how to do that?

@_subject: How can I encrypt with a PGP pub key and decrypt in pgp fw 6.5.8 
I'm now working on encrypt files with the public key which was exported from
PGP FW 6.5.8
But pgp still could not decrypt the gpg file correctly.
Following is my command lines:
$ gpg --import pgp_public_key.asc
$ gpg --pgp6 -r UID --encrypt test.txt
$ pgp test.txt.gpg -o test_decr.txt
Unrecognized characters appeared in test_decr.txt
