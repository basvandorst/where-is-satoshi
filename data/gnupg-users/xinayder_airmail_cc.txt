@_subject: Common directory for different installs of GnuPG 
I'm a newbie when it comes to using GnuPG and PGP. I have 2 different
versions currently installed in my system, so I'd like to know if
setting both versions to point at the same directory to obtain the
pubring.gpg, secring.gpg and trustdb.gpg files can cause critical issues.
Thank you.

Is there somewhere I can check what settings were added and removed in
the "update"?

Until this year there was no way to verify the signature of commits and
releases through the GitHub website, so they created a "kind of"
keyserver in their own server to manage users public keys.

It must be a false positive. I just downloaded the same file, I'm
running Windows 10 and my AV software (Malwarebytes) didn't complain
about it.
