Hash: SHA1
Unless you just want to experiment using PGP with remailers,
there are some services that provide a remailer web interface.
Cotse.net is one that I'm aware of, and I'm sure there are others

"Use our remailer interface to send completely anonymous usenet
posts and e-mail. When using the remailers your messages or posts
cannot even be traced back to Cotse."

Speaking of the gpg.conf file, can you show a sample gpg.conf file
that includes keyserver options, and any other options that you
think should be included?

Yeah, I know, but sometimes it's nice to just have the basics
pointed out. :-) Most of the time I'm using gpg with Windows--less
often with Red Hat linux.

# Unless you specify which option file to use (with the command line
# option "--options filename"), GnuPG uses the file
# ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
# by default.
# An options file can contain any long options which are available
# in
# GnuPG. If the first non white space character of a line is a '
# this line is ignored.  Empty lines are also ignored.
# See the man page for a list of options.
# Uncomment the following option to get rid of the copyright notice
# If you have more than 1 secret key in your keyring, you may want
# to
# uncomment the following option and set your preferred keyid.
 621CC013
# If you do not pass a recipient to gpg, it will ask for one.  Using
# this option you can encrypt to a default key.  Key validation will
# not be done in this case.  The second form uses the default key as
# default recipient.
 some-user-id
# By default GnuPG creates version 3 signatures for data files. # This
# is not strictly OpenPGP compliant but PGP 6 and most versions of
# PGP
# 7 require them.  To disable this behavior, you may use this option
# or --openpgp.
# Because some mailers change lines starting with "From " to ">From
# "
# it is good to handle such lines in a special way when creating
# cleartext signatures; all other PGP versions do it this way too.
# To enable full OpenPGP compliance you may want to use this option.
# If you do not use the Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) charset, you should
# tell
# GnuPG which is the native character set.  Please check the man
# page
# for supported character sets.  This character set is only used for
# Meta data and not for the actual message which does not undergo
# any
# translation.  Note that future version of GnuPG will change to
# UTF-8
# as default character set.
 utf-8
# Group names may be defined like this:
#   group mynames paige 0x12345678 joe patti
# Any time "mynames" is a recipient (-r or --recipient), it will be
# expanded to the names "paige", "joe", and "patti", and the key ID
# "0x12345678".  Note there is only one level of expansion - you
# cannot make an group that points to another group.  Note also that
# if there are spaces in the recipient name, this will appear as two
# recipients.  In these cases it is better to use the key ID.
 mynames paige 0x12345678 joe patti
# Lock the file only once for the lifetime of a process.  If you do
# not define this, the lock will be obtained and released every time
# it is needed - normally this is not needed.
# GnuPG can send and receive keys to and from a keyserver.  These
# servers can be HKP, email, or LDAP (if GnuPG is built with LDAP
# support).
# Example HKP keyserver:
#      x-hkp://pgp.mit.edu
# Example email keyserver:
#      mailto:pgp-public-keys
# Example LDAP keyservers:
#      ldap://pgp.surfnet.nl:11370
#      ldap://keyserver.pgp.com
# Regular URL syntax applies, and you can set an alternate port
# through the usual method:
#      x-hkp://keyserver.example.net:22742
# If you have problems connecting to a HKP server through a buggy
# http
# proxy, you can use keyserver option broken-http-proxy (see below),
# but first you should make sure that you have read the man page
# regarding proxies (keyserver option honor-http-proxy)
# Most users just set the name and type of their preferred
# keyserver.
# Most servers do synchronize with each other and DNS round-robin
# may
# give you a quasi-random server each time.
 x-hkp://pgp.mit.edu
 mailto:pgp-public-keys

# Common options for keyserver functions:
# include-disabled = when searching, include keys marked as
# "disabled"
#                    on the keyserver (not all keyservers support
# this).
# no-include-revoked = when searching, do not include keys marked as
#                      "revoked" on the keyserver.
# verbose = show more information as the keys are fetched.
#           Can be used more than once to increase the amount
#           of information shown.
# use-temp-files = use temporary files instead of a pipe to talk to
# the
#                  keyserver.  Some platforms (Win32 for one) always
#                  have this on.
# keep-temp-files = do not delete temporary files after using them
#                   (really only useful for debugging)
# honor-http-proxy = if the keyserver uses HTTP, honor the
# http_proxy
#                    environment variable
# broken-http-proxy = try to work around a buggy HTTP proxy
# auto-key-retrieve = automatically fetch keys as needed from the
# keyserver
#                     when verifying signatures or when importing
# keys that
#                     have been revoked by a revocation key that is
# not
#                     present on the keyring.
# no-include-attributes = do not include attribute IDs (aka "photo
# IDs")
#                         when sending keys to the keyserver.
 auto-key-retrieve
# Uncomment this line to display photo user IDs in key listings and
# when a signature from a key with a photo is verified.
# Use this program to display photo user IDs
# %i is expanded to a temporary file that contains the photo.
# %I is the same as %i, but the file isn't deleted afterwards by
# GnuPG.
# %k is expanded to the key ID of the key.
# %K is expanded to the long OpenPGP key ID of the key.
# %t is expanded to the extension of the image (e.g. "jpg").
# %T is expanded to the MIME type of the image (e.g. "image/jpeg").
# %f is expanded to the fingerprint of the key.
# %% is %, of course.
# If %i or %I are not present, then the photo is supplied to the
# viewer on standard input.  If your platform supports it, standard
# input is the best way to do this as it avoids the time and effort
# in
# generating and then cleaning up a secure temp file.
# The default program is "xloadimage -fork -quiet -title 'KeyID
# 0x%k' stdin"
# On Mac OS X and Windows, the default is to use your regular image
# viewer.
# Some other viewers:
# photo-viewer "qiv %i"
# photo-viewer "ee %i"
# photo-viewer "display -title 'KeyID 0x%k'"
# This one saves a copy of the photo ID in your home directory:
# photo-viewer "cat > ~/photoid-for-key-%k.%t"
# Use your MIME handler to view photos:
# photo-viewer "metamail -q -d -b -c %T -s 'KeyID 0x%k' -f GnuPG"
# Passphrase agent
# We support the old experimental passphrase agent protocol as well
# as the new Assuan based one (currently available in the "newpg"
# package
# at ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/aegypten/).  To make use of the
# agent, you have
# to run an agent as daemon and use the option
# use-agent
# # which tries to use the agent but will fallback to the regular mode
# if there is a problem connecting to the agent.  The normal way to
# locate the agent is by looking at the environment variable
# GPG_AGENT_INFO which should have been set during gpg-agent
# startup.
# In certain situations the use of this variable is not possible,
# thus
# the option
# # --gpg-agent-info=::1
# may be used to override it.

Hash: SHA1
USB and Windows If you can install GnuPG on a Windows machine, but you just don't
want to LEAVE your private keys there, this is one way to do it:
Change homedir (in the registry) to "A:\gpgsec" (trust file and
random seed file will be here from now on, along with your own
Leave the executables in "C\GnuPG" (for example)
GnuPG lets you use multiple keyrings, like, this in your gpg.conf
keyring C:\gpgpub\pubring.gpg
secret-keyring C:\gpgpub\secring.gpg
keyring A:\gpgsec\pubring.gpg
secret-keyring A:\gpgsec\secring.gpg
In this case, C:\gpgpub\pubring.gpg holds your common public keys
(that take up a lot of room) and C:\gpgpub\secring.gpg is just an
empty file.
Your keypairs (public and private) would be on the 3-1/2" floppy in
A: that you take with you.
When you run gpg, the floppy has to be there, and you might have
to update the trust file (if others have access to gpg too) but I
this works.
Somebody, let me know if I'm giving bad advice here.
