Imagine, you can forward all mails to your Hotmail account
to an other account.  So, why you don't forward your Hotmail
account to your ISPs account?
Then you could use every mailer you prefer.

Have you ever sent a message containing those umlauts (öäü)?
If you send such a message in the regular-old PGP BEGIN/END
format, then the umlauts get screwed up.  If you use
PGP/MIME this didn't happen.

Yes, that is true.  Get it from the nearest gnu mirror and
install it.  After install, "which make" or "which gmake"
should refer to the location of gnu make.
No, it isn't.

I guess it is impossible to create such a Photo-ID with
GnuPG, as the format isn't disclosed yet?  Am I right?

For example, you can send a mail to
  pgp-public-keys
You have to replace [TLD] by your countries top level
domain.  If you were in Swiss, then you would send the mail to
  pgp-public-keys
To receive a key, you have to give a subject to the mail
which explains, what you like to do: "get thomasb
would give you all keys matching thomasb .
So, in short:
  mail -s "get thomasb pgp-public-keys
would give you all keys matching thomasb Cheers, Thomas

Hi Vinod!
You can export it with
gpg --export -a [YOUR_KEY_ID_HERE]
You can export the private key with
gpg --export-secret-key [YOUR_KEY_ID_HERE]
gpg --export -a [YOUR_KEY_ID_HERE] > pgpkey.txt
gpg --export-secret-key -a [YOUR_KEY_ID_HERE] >> pgpkey.txt

Hi Bruce!

No, there isn't. I've put my keys an the pgp.net keyservers and one can
retreive and use them without a problem.
This should be on the homepage. Check that again, please!
