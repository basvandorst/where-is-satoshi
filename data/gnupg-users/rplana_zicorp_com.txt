I've been trying to set up Anubis (a mail proxy which does GPG signing/encrypting via GPGME) and am having some trouble with it. The program encounters an error with gpgme_engine_check_version(GPGME_PROTOCOL_OpenPGP) where it returns an Invalid Engine error.
I compiled a test program linked against libgpgme with just the three test function and here is the output:
Invalid Engine
Would someone hazard a guess as to what's wrong with my setup?
