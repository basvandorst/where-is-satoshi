@_subject: Building GnuPG 1.0.4 with MacOS X/Darwin 1.2 
I'm trying to build GnuPG 1.0.4 with MacOS X Public Beta (gcc and
Tools installed from the Darwin 1.2 image), but it doesn't seem to
work. While configure is trying to create the Makefiles the following
error message comes up:
[root ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/gnupg-1.0.4 --disable-asm
creating cache ./config.cache
checking host system type... powerpc-apple-darwin1.2
checking target system type... powerpc-apple-darwin1.2
checking build system type... powerpc-apple-darwin1.2
... many checks where the results look inconspicuous to me...
creating Makefile
sed: 50: conftest.s1: unescaped newline inside substitute pattern
(the same for other Makefiles)
I'm not sure from which sed call in configure this messages comes
from since there are tons of sed calls...
I also tried GnuPG 1.0.1 with the patch available at
 but it doesn't to work with
GnuPG 1.0.4... What's the best way for finding this strange error in
configure? ...or: Are there binaries available for OS X? ;-)
