Hello all,
  now I use KMail post client where it's alla automatically checked but when I am on the webmail where the signing and verifying is not "built-in" supported and when I receive an e-mail with an attchement "signature.asc", how can I verify the signature, please ?
Someone asked the same question a time ago, see here :)
OS: Linux debian 3.2.0-4-686-pae  SMP Debian 3.2.57-3+deb7u2 i686 GNU/Linux, Thanks in advance for explanation for a still newbie :)

Check out the trust of the key is possible at gnuPG/PGP servers:

thanks for your reply.
Maybe I do soemthing wrong and following the instructions, still receiving 'bad signature'.
It's my mail and my signature (for testing purposes) so I'm sure signature is ok, btw.
Does it matter if in the beginning of the part is:

@_subject: Updating public key problem 
Hi guys,
  I've updated my GnuPG key and send to keyservers.
What I updated ?
I've just deleted 2 expired subkeys and added one with a longer (in
2015) expiration.
But as I can see in a keyserver -
those 2 expired subkeys still appear and that's why, in my opinion, why
the sending an encrypted message doesn't work by the free service like -
 at zoho.com
Before the expirationd date of those 2 keys, the encrypt.to service worked.
Try to send me an e-mail via encrypt.to
or compare the publick key information with the attached (updated).
If the attachment is not included, I add the the ASCII format below.
Thanks for any tip how to correctly update or what to do, so my public
key would be possible to be used by encrypt.to for those who wanna send
me a private message.
Btw, I use Debian Wheezy, KDE, 32b., mostly Kgpg app or CLI gpg commands.
My updated public key:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.12 (GNU/Linux)
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
