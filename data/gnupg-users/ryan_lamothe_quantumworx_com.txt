Thank you for your reply.  Although not all .app bundles are Cocoa  apps, Eclipse is a good example.
How difficult would be it be to package this application as a .app  bundle instead of all over the filesystem like the typical Unix  application (which makes installing/uninstalling/upgrading a pita)?

Why isn't this application packaged like normal OS X apps in an  application bundle?  Why the Unix(Linux) bundling and installing?

It's not a matter of "why not do it yourself" but a matter of "why  isn't it being done" kind of question.
A graphical installer and uninstaller for the entire suite would be  nice.  Maybe I will find time to work on it, maybe someone else can too.
It is the same kind of question I ask the Mono and MonoDevelop  people, who not only did not write MonoDevelop using Windows Forms  (they used GTK), but an installation of "MonoDevelop for OS X"  requires a plethora of Fink/DarwinPorts Linux libs installed in order  to even begin using the entire package.  But that is another story  for another list.
