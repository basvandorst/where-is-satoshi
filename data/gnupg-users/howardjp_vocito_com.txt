@_subject: Question about multiple secret keys 
I have multiple encryption keys tied to one uid.  I have exported
the secret keys and disabled the master signing key so that I can
use what appears to be one master key/uid combination across
mutliple systems.  However, when I sign something, I receive errors
these errors:
  $ head /dev/zero | gpg --clearsign
  gpg: no secret subkey for public subkey F2F27436 - ignoring
  gpg: no secret subkey for public subkey 6A55BA00 - ignoring
  gpg: no secret subkey for public subkey 5A697E12 - ignoring
  gpg: no secret subkey for public subkey E89583AE - ignoring
  You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
This, in turn, causes mutt to display the error message.  Is there
any mechanism for disabling this announcement?
Thank you, James

I am not.  Further, setting --no-verbose has not improved the

@_subject: What does --export-secret-subkeys do? 
What exactly happens when you use --export-secret-subkeys?  From
what I understand, the master signing key is disabled in the new
secret key ring, but I would like to know more about how this
