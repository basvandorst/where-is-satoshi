@_subject: rsa.c, idea.c compiler error 
i would like to use old PGP 2.x keys with GNUPG.
I downloaded the modules from the contrib-directory and compiled them as
described in the HOWTOs:
gcc -Wall -O2 -shared -fPIC -o idea idea.c
gcc -Wall -O2 -shared -fPIC -o rsa  rsa.c
I get the error message
"idea.c:120: Invalid token in expression"
"rsa.c:49: Invalid token in expression"
I use gcc 2.7.2.1 on a Linux 2.0.35
Can you tell me, how I can solve this problem?
