@_subject: How to better start a web of trust 
I'm a newbie here so I have a pretty straight-forward question.
None of my friends, relatives etc. signs or encrypts their messages - the only signed messages I ever see come from various mailing lists. I'd like to check the signatures of these mails, though. So it brings up some questions:
1. How to start a web of trust?
2. Is there a need for my relatives/friends to use gnupg (or something similar) for their communication?
Hoping for an interesting discussion...
