@_subject: PGP/GPG interaction question 
I've scanned too much of the mailing lists, the docs, the ever-so-helpful 104 line --help output, and the magic 8 ball, all to no avail.
I'm running gpg 1.0.1 and am able to succesfully exchange fully encrypted emails with another gpg user.
A friend sent me some clearsigned email using "[windows] PGP Personal Privacy 6.5.3".  I have his key, have it loaded, but --verify claims "BAD signature from ...."   He also can not verify my clearsigns.
The online docs make much ado of exporting pgp keys to use as gpg keys, but to my mind, that was if you were shifting from pgp to gpg for personal use.  Unless that is also how you have to import them for --verify and what not?  But that would seem counter intuitive.... "Send me your key w/o passphrase"....
Can someone nudge me in the right direction or tell me which manual I should be reading?
