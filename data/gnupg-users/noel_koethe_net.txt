@_subject: pgp key 2.x and gnupg 
I have a signed 2.x key.
Now I want to switch to gnupg and want to sign my new created gnupg-key
with my pgp 2.x key because of the certifications of the 2.x.
I tried to sign it with pgp2 :
# pgp -ks noel -u noel .gnupg/pubring.gpg

Unsupported packet format - you need a newer version of PGP for this file.
Then I tried pgp5:
# pgp5 -ks noel -u noel .gnupg/pubring.gpg
Invoked with unknown symlink
( Dont know what this means ).
Maybe someone had the same problems and know the solution.
