Yes. If you want to decrypt mail for your private address at work or v.v.,
you need both keys. It's possible to transport your secret key to another
machine. Use gpg --export-secret-keys > filename. Then transport the file
you created by a safe means to your other machine. Mailing it encrypted to
your work address would work, or sftp if you have it. I wouldn't use ftp
etc, since that would send your private keys over the net for anyone to
catch. Yup. See above

Hmm, SUID root (chmod +s) can be dangerous as recent exploits have
shown. Adding no-secmem-warning to your .gnupg/options file is a valid
alternative for getting rid of the secure memory message. I have to agree with this all the way though... ;-)

Anyway, advising people to use secure memory by using suid is great, but
make sure you warn them that for some kernel versions they might be
opening themselves up to other risks. There are people out there that
don't know that.

my current version just two weeks ago. When did 1.0.1h become available?)

I've just installed GNUPG 1.0.1, and everything seems to be working fine,
except for one small detail. For some users, I get an error when trying to
import their public key: Unsupported public key algorithm, no valid user
IDs, this may be caused by a missing self signature. I'm using gnupg with pgp4pine. When I import the same key on another
machine running winblows with pgp 6.5.3 it is imported without any
trouble. To think that something that doesn't work on a linux machine
would work on a winblows machine of course goes against every law of
nature, so I would greatly appreciate it if someone could show me the
error of my ways. ;-)

there are still a number of keys not found on either.
