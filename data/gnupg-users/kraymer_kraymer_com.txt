@_subject: Decryption via UNIX shell script 
I am writing a shell script to automatically decrypt an encrypted file
using GPG.  How do I send the passphrase to the executable (GPG).  I want
no human intervention on this.  I'm calling the shell script from a batch
file to decrypt the file.
Anyone have a UNIX shell script (Korn Shell) that does this?
