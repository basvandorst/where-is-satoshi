@_subject: Expiration date of key signature 
hello gnupg-users,
if i want to sign a gpg-key, how do i set an expiration date for that
signature? i haven't found anything in the documentation about
characteristics of signatures other than the option --ask-cert-level.
i'm on debian stretch with gpg 1.4.20
thanks & cheers,

@_subject: Specify UID for --sign-key 
hello gnupg-users,
is it possible to specifiy the uid for --sign-key (so i don't have to go
through the gpg --edit dialog)? i tried using
=Name or just
as described on [0], but i always get asked if i want to sign all the
uids and then i have to say no and choose the one i specified...
thanks & cheers,

@_subject: Specify UID for --sign-key 
hi dkg and list,
thanks a lot!
are these reasonable defaults whats explained in the first paragraph or
is there more to it? in particular i'm interested in the cert-expire
option- i tried to use --quick-sign-key with --default-cert-expire 1y,
but then i didn't find a way to review the expiry date of the signature
(is there a switch to see the expiry date of signatures?)
thanks and cheers,

and thanks to this option my other question about --default-cert-expire
1y is lapsed, because that output shows that it works!

@_subject: gpg-agent and ~/.ssh/config IdentityFile 
this is actually more a ssh question, but i guess that the likelihood
for someone having the same problem is higher on gnupg-users:
if i use gpg-agent with ssh-support, is there a way to use the
IdentityFile option in ~/.ssh/config? When using ssh-agent i can point
IdentityFile to the corresponding private key, but i don't know how i
could do that using gpg-agent (esp. if the key is on card ;))

yes, you're totally right. sorry for not being clear about this. i've
Host *

at the beginning of my ~/.ssh/config. when authenticating to a host i
only want to use the one identity/key i've created for that host instead
of sending all of them to the server...

hello list,
i'm trying to edit a key using PyGPGME. I've written a short snipplet
based on the tests in the PyGPGME package:
 (the test only sends
'quit' but the goal is to send a 'minimize').
I get the error
When trying to run the packaged tests of PyGPGME [0], this codeblock
seems to work- does anybody see what might be the problem here?

@_subject: Which key is used to sign key? 
Hello again gnupg-users,
when i have multiple secret keys, how can i specify which one to use to
sign a key? (i.e. when using --quick-sign-key)

ah, thanks! yes, looking at the source this seems to be an alias for
--local-user / -u
