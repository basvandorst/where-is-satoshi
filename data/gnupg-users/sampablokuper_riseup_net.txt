@_subject: lsign and sign 
)
Has this changed since 2001?
I like to use cert-levels[1] to record how carefully I have checked keys
that I wish to sign.
In cases where the signee would prefer me not to publicly reveal
information about how carefully I have checked their key[2], I would
like to accommodate their wishes by signing with cert-level 0 but still
locally signing with the level appropriate to how thoroughly I have
checked their key, so that I have a signed record of this for myself, in
my keyring.
However, Neither gpg nor gpg2 seem to let me do this. If I `sign`,
regardless of cert-level, and then try to `lsign`, then I get a message
along the lines:
Likewise, if I instead reverse the order and `lsign` first, then when I
run the `sign` command, I get:
Either way, GnuPG stymies me in my desire to `sign` and `lsign` the same
UID with different values.
It would be nice if GnuPG offered a way to `sign` and `lsign` with
different values, to handle the use case I have presented.
Please could you let me know if it already does, and I have missed this
feature somehow, or alternatively whether this feature is planned for a
future release?
Many thanks,

[1] I have my own set of key-signing principles, which at some point I
will probably post online. Based upon observation of other GnuPG users'
habits, many do not use cert-levels. Of those who do, my level 1 is
probably equivalent to most people's level 2; my level 2 probably
equivalent to most people's level 3, and my level 3 is more extensive
than my level 2.

@_subject: Obituary for Artikel 10 Grundgesetz on GnuPG website 
At the bottom right-hand corner of many (all?) pages on the GnuPG
website, the following image is present:
It has an alt attribute that gives the text content of the image, and
reads as follows:
"Traueranzeige: Wir nehmen Abschied von einem sicher geglaubten Freund,
dem | Fernmeldegeheimniss | (Artikel 10 Grundgesetz) | * 23. Mai 1949, +
18. Dezember 2015"
The image also has a title attribute that reads:
"Article 10 of the German constitution (communication privacy) is not
anymore with us."
I would be grateful to know what happened (on 18 December 2015) to
prompt the posting of this statement on the GnuPG website.
I searched the archive but did not find an explanation. If that was a
failure on my part, please post a URL to the relevant archived post to
the list.
Thank you,

Thanks for working on the documentation :)
Please can you expand on what you mean by saying that Org "produces
lousy print output"?
I'm not aware of any objections to Texinfo, except that it would mean
switching away from Org. That could create hostages to fortune: people
wanting to maintain GnuPG documentation in the future having to learn
both mark-up formats; lack of clarity about which format they should use
going forward, etc. If you dismiss Texinfo on that basis, fair enough.
However, if you dismiss it because you personally don't like it, it
might be helpful for you to at least state your objections to it.
Why not use LaTeX export for Org-mode, and get the best of both worlds?
Please don't pick a format whose documents do not begin life as
human-readable plain-text files. That rules out DocBook, too.
As for other formats that *do* begin life as human-readable plain-text
files (e.g. ReStructuredText, Groff, CommonMark, etc.), they all share
the same problem as Texinfo. See above.
I vote for Org:
- GnuPG's lead developer likes Org & is, I would guess, more likely to
engage with the documentation if it is in Org.
- Org text is very human-readable in any decent text editor.
- Org has flexible output into LaTeX, HTML and ODT formats, among
others:  .
- Org maintains consistency with the existing docs.
Thanks again :)

Yes. It would go in the signing key slot.
Yes, but not on the same OpenPGP smart card as the master key, as
OpenPGP smart cards only have space for one signing key.
I believe that is correct. Someone with more experience may want to
verify this.

Thanks for clarifying. I wasn't aware of these issues.
Do you happen to have links to the relevant bug reports, or other
documentation of the issues?
Also, have you explored alternative pipelines from Org-mode to PDF?
Maybe via ODT or Markdown, etc?
Hm, you think it produces high-quality print output, but you don't like
the way it looks on the page. Not a *direct* contradiction, maybe... ;)
It's also deeply married to very specific font
I take your point here, but I'd suggest it isn't a priority. People come
to GnuPG for the cryptography, not the typography.
So, Texinfo still seems a reasonable candidate.
I've spent enough time hand-editing XML documents in text editors and
specialised XML editors that I've come to regard many XML languages as
not significantly more human-readable than binaries. Compared to Org,
ReST CommonMark, MediaWiki mark-up, etc, they require much more mental
overhead and/or editor configuration.
Getting clean plain-text diffs from these languages, including from
OpenDocument Text, can be a pain, which complicates revision control.
Support for editing documents like this in non-graphical free software
environments was poor, last time I checked.
It's up to you, of course - and maybe you like that sort of thing - but
I would generally encourage you not to inflict this upon yourself, let
alone anyone else :)
Thanks again,

I agree with Daniele's earlier reply. Using Org and LaTeX with UTF-8
would seem to be the best way forward.
If Org export to LaTeX really truly is impossibly buggy, then I
respectfully encourage exploring other Org export paths. Org export to
ODT followed by LibreOffice headless conversion to PDF, for instance.
Thanks, that's clearer now.
I believe it very strongly. I probably should have been clearer about that.
Specifically, I should have said about typography in the context of
GnuPG documentation, "I'd suggest it isn't top priority," rather than
"I'd suggest it isn't a priority."
I believe that making the content concise, comprehensible and accessible
is the top priority. Improving the appeal and comprehensibility further,
by judicious use of free software typographical tools that other
documentation volunteers will be able to work with in the future, is
probably the next priority after that. More power to your elbow for
taking on the task!
Best wishes, and thanks again for looking into it.
