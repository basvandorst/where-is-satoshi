Hell everyone,
On this link
is the following statement:
However, I'm not entirely clear on what happens when I do:
Is the secret key block that appears on STDOUT my plain secret key or is
it its encrypted version?
Best regards,

I am not sure that I follow.
First, it looks like multiple exports _do_ result in the exactly same
export data:
Which makes perfect sense to me. I would indeed expect my secret key
encrypted with my passphrase to be the same across multiple invocations
of the export command.
If a salt is used, how come that I can take my key that I've gotten
through a `gpg --export-secret-keys --armor ...` call and import it on a
different machine using only my passphrase?
Could you please elaborate a bit more on this or/and provide some useful

It is gpg version 2.2.4 with libgcrypt 1.8.1.
So, the two subsequent exports are supposed to give me my private key
encrypted with two different AES keys (same passphrase + a different salt)?
How does transferring the keys to a different machine is supposed to
work then?

OK, I see why this works. Because the salt, IV and protect count are all
stored in plain alongside the encrypted version of the secret key.
However, my secret key packets do not have that `iter+salt`, `protect
count` and `protect IV` parts. They have the plain `skey` parts. That
may be the reason why my subsequent exports are byte-equal.
Now, the issue that I have is that `gpg --passwd ` says that my
key is protected by a passphrase. It asks for the current passphrase
before it lets me type in the new one. How can it be that `gpg --passwd
` asks for the passphrase if `gpg --list-packets ` does
not have the `iter+salt` part? In other words, is  protected by
a passphrase or not?

This is confusing.
If I do:
My :secret sub key packet: looks more like the latter, which Angel says
indicates my key is _not_ protected by a passphrase.
However, if I do:
It asks me to enter the key's passphrase to "unlock it". Now, why does
it ask me to enter the passphrase if there is no passphrase for the
given key?
Ultimately, which one of the two is right; is my key stored in plane on
the disk because it does not have the `iter+salt` part in `gpg
--list-packets`, or is it stored encrypted using my passphrase that `gpg
--passwd` asks for?
I would be surprised if both can be true at the same time.
