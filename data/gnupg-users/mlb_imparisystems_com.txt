@_subject: Can we use GNUPG with PGP for commercial use 
I've bought software at companies like MCI, IBM and a couple of others. They just care if there's a contract and the contract is legal - meaning
"I'm paying for software "X" and you're going to deliver it this way" or
"You're going to come and install this software and it's going to work as
you advertised or you will refund our money".  I'm working for more and
more companies that are getting open source software - not just OS's, but
things like KnowledgeTree, Alfresco and Pentaho.
I work and live in the United States and I'm not going to even guess about
any other country and their laws.
Certainly, if you work for someone who doesn't like open source - you'll
get every kind of excuse from Monday and their arguments are all about as
reasonable as a schizophrenic homeless person could offer up.
Basically, companies are all about making money and at some point somebody
will realize that they can get Pentaho BI or Talend up and running for
about 1/10th the price of some Oracle solution and they'll take the risk
for the cash.
My humble opinion....

@_subject: Question about passphrase-fd 
Long story short, I use amanda for my backups and I've been using
encryptsimple for my backups.  My PC died completely, and I'm trying to
get the backups onto another machine.  I've stepped through the programs
and have found that it's calling gpg with gpg --batch --quiet --no-mdc-warning --decrypt --passphrase-fd 3

Here's the code that calls gpg for the encryption:
gpg --batch --no-secmem-warning --disable-mdc --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 --passphrase-fd 3  3
