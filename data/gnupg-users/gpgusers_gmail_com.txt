@_subject: My public key block appears different on keyservers 
Hi David, that newline-placement was my first guess, but a closer look
at the final three bytes (is that a CRC checksum ?) seems to tell a
different story... Maybe the packet lengths are different? I know
hardly anything about that detail

@_subject: Beginner generating a new key 
Hi folks,  I'm just starting to learn about GnuPG. My question is: are there
any problems with 3072D/4096g keys?
  I chose 3072bit DSA2 a few days ago because I didn't want to be
constrained by 160 bit hash requirement of DSA. Given that DSA2 wasn't
available in the default menu, and the "news" (probably old, but I'm such a
beginner) I heard today that gpg will soon switch its defaults to 2048-bit
RSA, does that mean any potential problems with my choice of key types and

@_subject: Exposing email addresses on key servers 
Dear all,
??I learned that public keyservers are a good way for key exchanges.
But I am still a little concerned: after all,?the UID's contain my
email addresses so by sending my keys up I am exposing my email
address to everybody. I'm not sure if there are spammers out there
doing all these key queries looping over every key-id, but it sounds
technically possible doesn't it (unless the key-id's are statistically
_very very_ sparse)?

Gracias Faramir y Allen!
I am very new here, so would anybody kindly give me a reference where
this previous discussions happened?
Yeah I found it a good idea! BTW it seems the file format doesn't
really stop us from putting invalid email address in the UID, so is
there a switch in gpg/gpg2 command line that skips email address
format checking altogether? My intension is to put obscured email
addresses, like rot13(xxx) or reversed(at-dot(email)) kind of stuff in
that field. Seahorse can do that, but only when generating keys, not
adding new UIDs

Hi folks, I found the option --allow-freeform-uid
Sorry for not doing enough RTFM before raising my silly question

Does it count if I put a human-readable address like johndoe AT
example DOT org? I know it (in such a form) is still fairly easy to
parse, but it's at least not as straightforward
An off-topic question: what's your free/libre solution to spams ? Is
anything doing as well as Gmail?
Gute nacht,

I should have made myself clearer: I was saying even if I used an
alternative spelling of my email address, I knew it would still be
possible to be parsed by a spammer.
But it wouldn't be worth the effort (to a spammer) coz any
implementation would be easily broken by other free form yet still
human-readable spellings.
At the moment I would be using signatures much more often than
receiving encrypted emails, so hopefully this shouldn't cause much
Since I still feel totally green in this area I am still listening to
opinions on the list and haven't pushed my key yet :P
Thanks for the info, it's a really useful piece

@_subject: defining port number for keyserver searches 
Does gpg use bind(2) at all? I guess when retrieving keys it only uses
connect(), so there shouldn't be a problem with NAT and inbound
connections and stuffs...
