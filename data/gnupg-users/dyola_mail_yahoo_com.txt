I am attempting to install Enigmail and am trying to follow the
directions. I downloaded the full linstaller for Windows but then saw in
the NotePad READ ME.txt that it was the 2.0 beta version which should
not be used.
I am confused. I have also downloaded gnupg-2.0.20.tar.bz2, but I cannot
open it.
What am I doing wrong?
