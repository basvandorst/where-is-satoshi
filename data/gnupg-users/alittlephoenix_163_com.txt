@_subject: Bug report:data lost 
I found a critical bug of GPG4win,which may cause data loss.It's
that,when I select several files that with Chinese character names,right
click and select encrypt and/or sign,and do it ,then these several
files can not packaged and encrypted to a .tar.gpg archive.The data
lost,not packaged in the archive.That may cause data lost.The issue is
that ,the GPG don't support Chinese character well.In the above case,if
the file named English letters,there's no problem.The same thing
happens when select a folder which include several files named with
Chinese characters and right click to encrypt or sign.This is very
Is that a problem?
Thanks for solving it.
Best regards.
