@_subject: Using output from gpg --list-packets on a key to get the mpi values 
Hey guys,
I am trying to use gpg generated public keys to do encryption using
libgcrypt. I used the list packets command on the key to get me the contents
of the key and parsed the mpi values into an s-expression. So when I try to
encode my session key with my public key I get the error "Odd hexadecimal
numbers in S-expression"? I think list packets is maybe giving me hex
numbers without the leading zero? If so what do I need to do to get me mpi
values that I can use in libgcrypt?
Thanks in advance,
