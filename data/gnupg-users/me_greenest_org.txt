Hi all and thank you for GnuPG!
I was wondering whether one attacker who'd be in possess of my private and public keys, my entire archive of encrypted data, and a common file which for sure is just plain the same as an encrypted one of my backup, could in some way and time recover my passphrase.
Let's suppose I am a developer which shares some pieces of a project and doesn't some others, as such some of the files are plainly available to the attacker, and even if I crypt all the files at once with a strong algo and gpg, but let my keys available to the attacker, would he theorically be able to crack my passphrase and recover all of my archive?

So if the strenght of passphrase is something like 25 chars (a-Z,0-9,non alphanumeric) I can rest assured nobody today or in a year could possibly decrypt even someone with a distributed super calculus hardware power, is it? GnuPG is above all!!!
