@_subject: C Compiler Error in AIX 5.3 During GnuPG Build 
I downloaded GnuPG and required libraries and am attempting build of the first required package npth-1.6.
The ./configure step failed with the below error.
configure:3552: error: in `/fin3/app/app/capplmgr/mlc-rot/gnupg/npth-1.6':
configure:3554: error: C compiler cannot create executables
See `config.log' for more details
I looked in config.log and extracted the below excerpt that shows more details about the error.

Version: 09.00.0000.0000
configure:3463: $? = 0

See `config.log' for more details
It seems that the key log entry here is the line: cc: 1501-228 (W) input file $(INCLUDE_FLAGS) not found
I would appreciate any help/advise on how to fix this error.

I had a look inside the source src/gpg-error.c in the vicinity of lines 497 to 501. Below is a code snippet. I am not a C developer but it seems to me that the 4th call to ARGPARSE_c below which I've highlighted in RED is incorrect C code.

Hi Werner,
You hit the nail on the head.
Looks like CFLAGS was indeed set by another script that is run automatically after login. After ensuring that script is not run. The compile error I was experience went away.
Thanks very much for your help.

configure does an early test to see whether your C compiler works.  This is done to detect crippled compilers delivered on some systems.  Seems not the case here, though.
... $(INCLUDE_FLAGS) looks like a make macro and definitely does not belong here.  Check whether you have set any of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS set in your environment or whether the envvar CC specifies these flags.  It is also possible that cc is shell script or other wrapper which invokes the real CC; check for uncommon things in your PATH.
