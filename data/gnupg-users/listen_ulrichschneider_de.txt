@_subject: can`t verify signature 
My OS is SuSE Linux 8.2 and I use gnupg 1.2.2-rc1. When I try to verify
a signed Mail there are sometimes difficulties. I would like to figure
out the following error messages:
1. something like "no signed data" - here is the shell-output:
sure gpg --verify Neue_FTP-Kennworte_für_Homepages
gpg: keine unterschriebene Daten
gpg: can't hash datafile: 2. something like "unexpected data" - shell-output:
sure gpg --verify PGP_Signed_Mails
gpg: verify signatures failed: Unerwartete Daten
The sender uses Mozilla-Mail together with enigmail. I will post parts
of the (modified) source-code of the mails not verifiable.
Can anyone help? Thanks in advance.

Thanks for the suggestions.
Anyway, I don`t know what you mean with the statement above. I use
sylpheed as mailclient, but it sais something like: "bad signature"
The problem occurs, because gpg can`t verify the signature, so I think,
that it has nothing to to with the mailclient. Bye, Ulrich Schneider
