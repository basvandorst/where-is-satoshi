@_subject: Lost passphrase 
It appears I've forgotten my passphrase.  I've still got the secret key, the revocation certificate and I remember the first 5 characters of the passphrase.  I know the rest is just alphanumeric upper and lowercase.  Does anyone know of a perl script or some other utility that could bruteforce the rest of it?  I'd rather not have to revoke this key.
Thanks
