Can any tell me if there is a known compatibility issue with
PGP v7.0 and GnuPG 1.0.6?
I'm having problems decrypting a clients message.  I am using
GnuPG 1.0.6 and the client is using PGP 7.0.  The client is
able to decrypt my messages.  The error I get when trying
to decrypt the 7.0 message is as follows:
gpg: decryption failed: bad key
Any ideas?
Thank you in advance.

So the client should be encrypting binary?  I forgot to mention that we haven't tried any signatures
yet so signing is not (yet) an issue.  Thanks for all the suggestions, I'll check em out and
keep you all posted.
Thanks again,

Got it.  I'm not exactly sure what the problem was but this is
what I did.
To recap:  We have GnuPG 1.0.6 and we were not able to decrypt
PGP 7.0 files (no sigs, no IDEA, no BLOWFISH or TWOFISH).
What I did:
I downloaded PGP 7.0.3, installed it and generated a key pair.
I exported the PGP 7.0.3 key pair and then imported it into GnuPG
gpg --import --allow-secret-key-import New_Keys.asc
I then exported the public key for the new key pair and
passed it off to the customer.  Now I am decrypting his
I know this is a hack and I would much rather know what was wrong but it works.
Thanks all.
