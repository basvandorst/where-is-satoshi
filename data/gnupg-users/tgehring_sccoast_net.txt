@_subject: using decrypt from shell script 
I'm really new to using Gnupg, so I apologize for probably asking a
question that has been asked many times before. But I have an
application developed in C and Korn Shell scripts that needs to decrypt
GPG files automatically and can't seem to get pass the requirement to
enter the passphrase. I've tried using "here" and attempted to use
--batch. How can I do this?
