@_subject: Problems with PGPfreeware 6.5.3 public key 
Sorry to disturb you. Also, please reply to me directly as I am not a
member of a group.
I have a small problem. I have received a public key from a friend,.
He made a key by using the above  software, as depicted in the subject
of this mail.
gpgv  however, is not able to verify it, so I would like to know ho9w
can I exchangle encrypted messages with my friend.
gpgv reads aout a header fine, but then it says just:
unexpected data.
Is there any way that my friend can generate a public key, so that it
is readable by GPG.
One more little question. What is the fastest way for me to generate
my own public keys. I must confess that I am quite ignorant .... ;o)
Many thanks in advance.

@_subject: Small problem with 1.2.3 
Sorry for bothering this list, but I did not find the answer in FAQ.
My friend has sent me key public key which GnuPG has nicely entered
into the puplic key-ring. However, when I get his encrypted message (he uses version 1.0.6) I
get the following error:
gpg: armor header: Version: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)
gpg: armor header: Comment: For info see gpg: CRC error; 5b577e - dc35b5
gpg: quoted printable character in armor - probably a buggy MTA has been used
I do not have any problems with messages from other friends.
Thanks very much in advance.
