I have GnuPG/MacGPG2 (v. 2.0.26) on my system (OS X 10.10.1), installed via GPG Tools Suite.
I have four keypairs associated with my main email, two of which are revoked and one expired. But if I
try to edit the main key associated with email by
$ gpg --edit-key then it invokes gpg and points to one of the revoked keys rather than the active key. I have to explicitly
give the short ID of the active key to edit that key and get its fingerprint.
Is there a way to change this, or I am doing something wrong?

@_subject: Gnupg-users Digest, Vol 135, Issue 42 
Minton and  Barton, thanks for the info.  I use
then GPG suite ( which has the really
useful GPG Keychain GUI for managing keys.  So I don?t need
to use the command line, but I want to learn how to do so,
hence my question, which was really about the behaviour of
gpg (I am using version 2.0.26).
I think it would be nice to have gpg (on the command line)
show an auto-completion list of the short IDs of all keys
associated with a particular email when the user does
$ gpg --edit-key simply because although it is easier to remember an email
than a key ID, no matter how short.  Users think in terms
of emails, not key IDs (maybe this would be different for a
regular user of encryption tools).  At the moment what
this does is launches gpg and points it to a revoked key.
This seems wrong, even if the command is ambiguous.
I can always do
$ gpg ?edit-key to edit a specific key, but I?m making a point about having
gpg be neater on the command line.  I don?t know whether
this is an issue with other users, but I thought I would bring
to the forum?s attention.
I?m still relatively new to GnuPG (and using encryption) but
I think what confuses (or overwhelms) a lot of people about
encryption tools is the amount of work involved in key
management - for example, what is the actual difference in
practice between a revoked key and an expired key?  Do
most people here think that it is OK to delete a revoked key
only a sufficient passage of time,

Hi Philip
Actually, there is information in the Manual (
about adding photos to your keys, the relevant section is 4.1.3 (of the HTML version of the manual)
on key management, which is this page
The command is the `addphoto` subcommand of `?edit-key` - one adds a photo by executing
`$ gpg ?edit-key  addphoto`
which prints out the following message (after the key information and associated emails):
Pick an image to use for your photo ID.  The image must be a JPEG file.
Remember that the image is stored within your public key.  If you use a
very large picture, your key will become very large as well!
Keeping the image close to 240x288 is a good size to use.
Enter JPEG filename for photo ID:
This message indicates acceptable dimensions but not size.  However some GUI key
management tools, such as Keychain tool from the GPG Suite ( specify that
photos must be < 500 KB and the recommended size be < 15 KB.

@_subject: Key selection 
I didn?t mean to suggest that `gpg` should do any guessing in this
Maybe I?m wrong and this is a minor issue, but from
a simple request-response model point of view when
`gpg ?edit-key` is invoked by a user with an argument which i
not a specific key ID but an email which is associated with
multiple keys in the keychain then it seems it should certainly
not cause `gpg` to point to any revoked or expired key, as is
happening now (for me anyway).  This is clearly a bug, and
surely there?s an easy fix for it - check whether there are
any active (non-expired, non-revoked) keys, if so present the
list to the user to choose, if not print an appropriate message
that would cause the user to either generate a new key for that
email, and edit that key, or do a lookup on another source where
they have stored keys.
This issue is specific to the command line program, not any
GUI based program like Keychain (from MacGPG2 suite), because
there the user can see the keys and know which one to edit.

I don?t agree.
Why isn?t the photo ID feature not useful?  Surely any piece of
information that would help another person, with whom you
are proposing to communicate, to identify you first, is a good
thing.  Before they can trust you enough to sign the key (which
can?t be very often using the PGP model) they must be able to
identify you, and a photo ID helps them to put a name to a face,
or at least provides a reference point with which to do other
checks, before signing the key, let alone encrypting -
someone?s photo ID to do a google image search on it, bringing
up other information that could be useful.
Maybe I?m wrong but the problem with GPG is that it has too few
verification tools, like the photo ID.  In my keychain I have 35
public keys for different individuals with whom I may want
to communicate via GPG, but I?ve probably only signed a fraction
of them, maybe 10, and only a handful of those are people I
know personally.  I always sign my messages, but if you are
unable to trust someone enough to sign they key (or even their
signature) then I?m not sure that PGP is very useful or fulfils
its purpose.
As for the photo ID feature itself surely there are technical fixes
for that, including allowing people to upload slightly larger images
than would bepossible with the recommended dimensions without increasing
the key size.  For reference, passport photographs are pretty
small, as we are all aware, (I think 35 by 45 mm in the EU), and
when we send email a scan of our passport page for some job
application or whatever it is not likely to be a good.

GitHub supports pull/push via SSH or HTTPS therefore you can do this to with MacGPG (2)
or any GitHub repo.
There must be lots of MacGPG users and most of them probably use the GPG
suite, because it is GUI based (also more user friendly, unlike GnuPG) and it
would not be fair on them to unilaterally remove the link to GnuPG or to receive
some kind of security warning without raising the issues you mention with

I suppose if you were conceited enough to describe yourself
as a ?power user? then you might be dumb enough to think
that people who use GPG Suite are ?dumb users?.
Platform fanatics and those make an easy job of caricaturing
themselves in their fanaticism for a ?pure setup?, which is an
illusion.  In the real world every system can be compromised
and no can have such a setup, no matter how hard you try.
You don?t have to choose between OS X and Linux, there are
lots of people who use both.
I have both GnuPG and GPG Suite, and I use both when I have
to.  As a user, not a developer on MacGPG, the issues previously
raised here about the remote execution of scripts etc. may be
questionable, but they do not directly affect my use of the software,
which is nothing but a front end for GnuPG.
The GPG plug-in for Apple Mail is not without its shortcomings but
it is incredibly easy to use and works well the other components
of the GPG suite.  I have not used Enigmail, but it?s simply a
question of choice.

I would also add that if you agree that more people should
be using encryption in more forms then the way to go is
to make it more more usable and user friendly (and at the
moment the standard GnuPG version can?t exactly be described as
that) then this is not an aspiration that should be described
as dumb.  What is probably dumb is the kind of purist attitude
about the perfect Linux platform and how great it is to have
the perfect GnuPG set up.
I would bet that more people who?ve used tools like GPG Suite
have taken up encryption than those exposed to the command
line subtleties of GnuPG.  Both can be used at the same time,
as I do, you don?t have to choose between them.

I do think your key fingerprint should be made more visible on gpgtools.org
and it would be a good idea to have instructions for users to do the checksum and
verify the signature of the dmg (there are probably lots of people who don?t even
know how to do checksums).

is a static reference which could cause problems with file

damaged, or deleted.  It is better to use the  because
that doesn?t change whatever happens to your local key file

Sorry if I misunderstood, but I didn?t say that the photo ID should
be allowed to be as large as possible, and this is not allowed anyway
by, for example, apps like GPG Keychain.
But I was wondering ? instead of attaching a photo to a public key,
why not attach a hash of the photo using an image hashing
algorithm?  I don?t know much about image hashing (but this
discussion has now made me more curious to learn) but such an
algorithm is supposed to calculate a hash value for an image that
could be compared against **perceptually similar** images.  Since this will
be a string it would not lead to the blob attack scenario described before.
I found some interesting resources including a paper describing some
and there are also several API implementations
     (C++)
     (Python).
Would it not be possible for gpg to incorporate these so that a user
can attach a set of hash values for their photo(s) to their public key that
recipients could check against some other source?

@_subject: Key generation, subkeys and improved documentation 
I have a couple of questions about key generation, subkeys and the documentation
on gnupg.org.
(FYI I have GnuPG/MacGPG (v. 2.0.26) on my Mac.)
1. I just tried to generate an RSA keypair using `gpg` on the command line, and it
asks me to choose a key length between 1024 and 8192.  Here is the relevant output
from my terminal session:
    RSA keys may be between 1024 and 8192 bits long.
    What keysize do you want? (2048) 8192
    Requested keysize is 8192 bits
I thought the maximum was 4096?  For example, GPGKeychain (the GUI keychain
utility from the GPGTools suite which installs the GnuPG/MacGPG) doesnt?t allow
key sizes bigger than 4096.  In any case, choosing 8192 fails with `gpg`:
    gpg: keysize invalid; using 4096 bits
Shouldn?t this be changed to ensure that 4096 is the limit, or is it possible to have
an 8192 length RSA key or this limited by the current capabilities of the random
number generator?
2. The key generation dialogue for v. 2.0.26 (started by `gpg ?gen-key`) shows
the following list of options for keys:
    Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
As a user this is confusing to see, for example, RSA and RSA - of course I worked
out afterwards that this was going to generate two keypairs one for signatures (S),
the other for encryption (E), but at the moment it?s just confusing, even if have to
generate new keys again.  There is also no explanation that the public key itself is
a pair of keys, one which actually makes the signatures using the private key, and
the other (subkey) which others use to encrypt messages to you.
Also these subway codes S, E, and also C, A are not explained at all - I had to
lookup the source code (?keyedit.c` in the `/g10/ subfolder of the source folder) to
guess at what they mean.
For example, here is the information provided by `gpg` for my keybase.io public key:
pub  4096R/9EAB92B4  created: 2014-12-30  expires: never       usage: SCEA
                     trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate
sub  2048R/238026C5  created: 2014-12-30  expires: 2022-12-28  usage: S
sub  2048R/66C9185A  created: 2014-12-30  expires: 2022-12-28  usage: E
[ultimate] (1). keybase.io/sandeepmurthy There should be an explanation surely of what S C E A mean: S (signatures),
E (encryption), C (creating a certificate) and A (authentication?).
3. At the moment the documentation on gnupg.org - both the manuals and the
privacy handbook - are out of date for v. 2.x+), e.g. the privacy handbook
 showing the possible keypair
choices as
   (1) DSA and ElGamal (default)
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (4) ElGamal (sign and encrypt)
which is obviously different from what the current one version allows.  Perhaps
there should be a much better explanation of subways and the codes S, C, E, A,
because I don?t think it?s there right now.  Since the handbook is aimed at first
time users it seems these updates should be (and could be) made very quickly.
I use GnuPG but I would also like to contribute.  Would it be possible to clone
the repo and make a pull request or something like that?

I like the idea of Keybase, although it may appear ironic
that an application designed to encourage people to
protect their privacy by using encryption more widely
and accessibly may require the storage and public
monitoring of digital identity records.
I think it shows there must be give and take - if you want
complete privacy you can go and hide in a bunker completely
cut off from the external world.  But if you have any desire
to communicate with others then you have to be willing to
give up the that little bit of your public identity which you want
other people to know is genuine, in order to protect your
private communications.

Wouldn?t this issue of possible collisions in the long key ID (64 bits / 16 hex digits)
causing problems for the GPG program only be an issue in an organisational setting,
where there is a large number of users sharing that program and where keys
are uploaded to/retrieved from key servers using short IDs?
For an individual who for example only imports keys with fingerprints (160 bits /  40 hex) and
publishes their fingerprint rather than the short or long key ID, how can this risk arise
or is there still an issue with key servers?

There are degrees of ?control over your hardware? and

If the concerns voiced by some developers about the

number generator (RNG) around the time of the
Snowden leaks are true
then we are all compromised, so why are we even
bothering to use tools like GnuPG, which according
to the documentation uses Intel?s RDRAND CPU
instruction (which calls its hardware RNG) among its

I was referring to exactly that - *somebody else* having "complete
control" over your hardware, remotely.  There are degrees of that,
and it just seems like an uninteresting abstraction here - what does it
look like?
The original question was:
An even simpler solution would be to disable all remote sharing
services via the OS.  What else does remote access mean?  After
Shellshock anyone with a Unix like OS enabling such services, e.g.
like SFTP or SSH, is recommended to either upgrade their Bash shell, or
turn off these services completely, which is easy to do.

control that somebody else can have over your computer.  I don?t
think this tells us anything in relation to the original problem, and besides from
a practical point of view there are some simple steps people can take to
reduce risks, for example, of unauthorised or malicious remote access.
I didn?t state any opinions about somebody continuing to use their
compromised system to counteract further efforts.
Hardware compromise again is an abstraction.  There are many
imaginable ways in which your computer could be compromised, the
question only becomes interesting when it relates to particular attacks /

In Australia this idea, unfortunately, may become reality - a proposed

debated in parliament, although public opinion is against data retention.
Hopefully this change will fail.
Once such a data retention law is in place it is dangerous because inevitably
there is a ?mission creep? that sets in - it is not hard to imagine one day that
encryption software users, maybe GPG users, will be required to disclose
information about the way they use it.  I think in the UK recently the PM
made some ambiguous comments which can be interpreted as seeking a
ban on end-to-end encryption software by private users on the grounds that
terrorists benefit just as much as ordinary law-abiding citizens from using
encryption.  Of course this shows he just does not understand the issues
involved and this idea will not go anywhere.
