@_subject: GPG.conf Cipher Preference 
I am trying to get gpg to encrypt files with a certain cipher preference.  I
am using Gentoo Linux, btw.  I have my gpg.conf set-up like so:
default-preference-list S10 S9 S8 S4 S2 S7 S3 H10 H9 H8 H11 H3 H2 H1
personal-cipher-preferences S10 S9 S8 S4 S2 S7 S3
personal-digest-preferences H10 H9 H8 H11 H3 H2 H1
personal-compress-preferences Z3 Z1 Z2
I am using a DSA2 (3072 bit) pub key along with an Elgamal sub-key (4096).
My problem: Whenever I encrypt a file it always uses 3DES.  I have noticed
that I can change the order of 3DES and CAST5 and it will encrypt with
whichever comes first.  However, it totally ignores TWOFISH, AES(all of
them) and BLOWFISH, even if they come in front of 3DES and CAST5.  I have already checked and I have all of the above algorithms compiled into
my kernel.
Now, if I add:
cipher-algo TWOFISH
it WILL use TWOFISH to encrypt files.  So, my question is, if I use this flag to always make it encrypt with
TWOFISH, will that allow me to communicate with those who are not using
TWOFISH on their machine?  Can I add more than one cipher to the
"--cipher-algo" flag?
What is the difference in "cipher-preferences" and "cipher-algo?"  I take it
that cipher-algo only allows one cipher, thus my question.
Thanks in advance.

Hmmm.  I figured it out just after I posted this.  It's odd.  I went and uncommented the "cipher-algo" flag, then suddenly it
started encrypting in the order I had them set in the cipher-preferences
flag.  It wasn't doing this before.  It was only after I added cipher-algo
and then removed it that it worked.

I believe that within the next five years someone will discover an academic
attack against Rijndael. I do not believe that anyone will ever discover an
attack that will allow someone to read Rijndael traffic. So while I have
serious academic reservations about Rijndael, I do not have any engineering
reservations about Rijndael.  -- Bruce Schneier, Cryptogram Newsletter,
October, 2000.
We don't quite trust the security...No other block cipher we know of has
such a simple algebraic representation. We have no idea whether this leads
to an attack or not, but not knowing is reason enough to be skeptical about
the use of AES.
However, even though he has reservations about Rijndael, he has said
publicly numerous times that he prefers everyone to use AES instead of the
other finalists, no doubt because it has had undeniably more analysis thrown
its way.

If one really wanted to overthrow the "People's Republic of Berkeley," using
obfuscated e-mail addresses with the proposed methods outlined in this
thread would be akin to inventing a solution for a problem that doesn't
exist.  There are already numerous methods for off-the-record encrypted
communications.  Indeed, OTR was to devised as a protocol that allows
encrypted and authenticated communications without having to be a slave to
an interminable digital signature that might come back to haunt you.
As for remaining anonymous, one can merely connect to the IM server via Tor
or some other similar method.  Or one could even run their own P2P IM
software like XMPP thus cutting out the middle man.  Another option is a
hidden .onion IRC service or a SILC chat conference.  If one is really bent
on using e-mail, one can merely create a throw-away address using Tor and
then create a throw-away GPG key.  There are numerous ways to do this
OpenPGP's goal is not anonymity or deniability.  If you want that, there's
better protocols and methods as Robert Hansen has hinted at already.

@_subject: Where is ECC in gpg2 (specifically gnupg-2.0.21 
I second this motion.  After the recent revelations about NSA shenanigans
regarding NIST and with Bruce Schneier himself saying he is highly
suspicious of NIST curves, I think it behooves the OpenPGP standards group
to think about alternative curves.  Of course, some users of OpenPGP will
need NIST compliance, and that's fine.  It can still be included as long as
the rest of us (who don't like being played for fools) have alternatives
I don't think there is a better place to start than with djb's curve25519. It is faster than the NIST curves, can be shown to have "nothing up the
sleeve" and appears to be quite secure.  Djb even gave a talk a number of
years ago where he compared it to NIST curves and even raised his own
suspicions about how those curves were generated.  Moreover, djb has
provided a lot of reference implementations for it (with full C code) on his
site, thus implementation is more of a "will to do it" than a technical
challenge. It's good to see that Werner has already made the suggestion to implement
different curves.  Let's hope that the OpenPGP working group agrees with his
recommendation and that we can finally see (non-tampered with) ECC put into
use in Gnupg.
