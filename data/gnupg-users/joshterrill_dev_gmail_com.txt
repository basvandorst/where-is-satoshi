I'm having a hell of a time trying to compile and install gnupg from the
source code on an ubuntu machine. I've posted a thread on AskUbuntu here
if someone would be willing to lend a hand.

@_subject: Just published a browser-based PGP tool 
Hash: SHA512
Hey everyone,
I just wanted to show you guys a site that I published, it's a
browser-based PGP tool that allows you to generate, encrypt, and decrypt
PGP messages. There's no server interaction, all of the functionality of
the site happens on the client. Right now it's pretty minimal and simple,
but I have plans to eventually turn it into a secure mobile messaging app
as well as adding more functionality such as signing, verifying, etc.
I am looking for some help as I move forward with this and would greatly
appreciate it if some of you would be willing to work on this with me;
whether it be with coding or brainstorming/offering advice and feedback.
I'm still somewhat new to encryption methods and could really use the help!
If you are interested, you know my email, and my public key can be found on
the contact page of the site if you want to use it.

@_subject: Question about getting started with PGP and smart cards 
I am looking to play around/experiment with gnupg and smart cards. From
what little research I've done, I've read about OpenPGP smart cards don't
reveal private keys, and do all decrypting/signing on the device itself
after entering a PIN. Do I have a correct understanding of this, and if so,
is this the common/most secure way to use these cards? For simple
encrypting, decrypting, and signing what card and card reader would you
recommend? I have a windows environment and an ubuntu environment that I
can play with it on.

Ah nevermind, looks like that card doesn't support PGP. I have a g10 card
coming in a few days. Hopefully that will work.

@_subject: Issue with PIVKey C910 PKI Smart Card 
I just bought a SCM reader (
and PIVKey C910 PKI Smart Card (
I'm running Windows 10, and installed GPG from GPG4Win (
I'm looking at all these articles online that say you should be able to
edit the card by typing in gpg --card-edit, but when I type that in, I get
gpg: detected reader `SCM Microsystems Inc. SCR33x USB Smart Card Reader 0'
Please insert the card and hit return or enter 'c' to cancel:
So I've tried taking out the card, putting it back in, restarting the
windows service in task manager, unplugging the reader, plugging it back
in, etc. Nothing changes.
When I try gpg2 --card-edit, I get gpg: OpenPGP card not available: Not
I am typing this in, in a windows command prompt running as administrator.
Any suggestions? I'm trying to get some pgp keys onto the card and use it
for decrypting, signing, etc.

Thanks for the replies, everyone. So what about a solution like Yubikey
NEO? I read on their site that you can generate a keypair and put it on the
yubikey. But what I'm a little confused about is, once you have the public
and private key on the card, how do you use it to encrypt/sign/decrypt
things? Excuse my lack of knowledge on this. It all seems pretty cool, and
I'm just trying to wrap my head around it.
