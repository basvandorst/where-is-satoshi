@_subject: syntax for encrypting only the string passed in an argument 
Does you "development environment" allow you to feed things to stdin?
Because that's how gpg would normally expect to receive the text, if
an input file is not specified. I don't know whether or not there's a
way to specify the text directly in an argument (seems very unlikely,
most plaintext would be difficult to escape for use on a command
line). Depending on how the shell function commands, you might be able
to do it directly from there, e.g., `cat myfile | gpg -e -r joe`.

@_subject: GPG executable for Unix/Apache ? 
No you can't build it on Windows...well, you might be able to build it
on windows if you have the proper tools (most likely GNU make, gcc and
possibly others), but that will only build a Windows executable, which
cannot be executed natively on a Unix-like system. What I meant by
source is to download and extract the tar.gz on your web server, and
build it there. The usual sequence is './configure; make; make
install', but you will likely need super-user (root) permission to
install it. You could try configuring it to install to a directory you
have permissions to write to, and then you shouldn't need special
permissions to install it: if you decide to go this route, I can try
to help you configure it.
But this is all assuming that you have some sort of shell access to
the server, so that you can issue the commands. The same is true for
the alternative of installing a binary using a package manager.
Basically, it comes down to that fact that gnupg is software that
needs to be installed on your server, and you need to have permission
and the ability to do this, or you're pretty much out of luck, unless
you talk your host into installing it for you.
You are correct about decrypting; you will need to install a Windows
version in order to decrypt the message, and you will need to have
your secret key on your windows machine. There are easy to use
installers for Windows available on that same link I sent you before,
should be straightforward.
Let us know if you can get shell access to the server and, if
possible, what distribution of Linux (if it is Linux) the server is
running, and we can go from there.

Anyone know if there's a specific reason the OpenPGP standard doesn't
cover key ring file formats?

Fair enough, I hadn't considered the prospect of keys coming from other sources.

@_subject: Two convicted in U.K. for refusal to decrypt data 
Has everyone seen the "Vanish" project from University of Washington?
If you haven't you should really give their paper a read, it's pretty
interesting. The basic idea is that the key is random, and no-one
actually needs to "know" it: it's broken up using secret sharing and
dsitributed through a peer-to-peer network. The recipient can retrieve
the shares and reconstruct the key for a one-time decryption, but over
time, the shares should naturally leave the network and eventually the
key is lost completely.
I have my doubts, but I'm open to the possibility that it could work,
and I'm very interested to see how law-enforcement will respond if it
does. Will they force all p2p nodes to log everything, try to monitor
networks themselves, or just plain make the system illegal?

If you truly believe that, then there's no reason not to hand over
your encryption key immediately to your local police department. For
that matter, turn over a copy of your house key too: that's about
protecting you from the "bad guys", not the police, right?
Clearly I'm being a little extreme (ad absurdum) , but you need to
re-read the article: it said the cases had to do with the crimes you
mention, but it specifically didn't say that the people being charged
with refusing to turn over their key were actually suspects. For all
we know, they could be childhood school mates of the suspect who
haven't seen him/her in thirty years.
And, as many on this list have already pointed out, even if they were
suspects, that in no-way means that they actually are child-molesters
or terrorists, it means somebody things they might be. I could very
well claim that there's a secret message coded in your lengthy email
signature which admits to a vile crime; that doesn't mean you actually
did it. Would you want to turn over all your encryption keys and
passphrases just because I made some accusation?
Clearly this is a tricky issue, because there are two important but
conflicting values at stake: public safety and private rights. But I'd
like to just keep one thing in your mind when this comes up; a little
mantra to chant to yourself: "I am innocent until proven guilty."

@_subject: Public key crypto by hand 
Replying to myself, I found Crowley's site detailing the bias in
solitaire: I only really have a basic understanding of crypto, nothing deeply
mathematical enough to understand how this actually effects the
strength of the cipher. Would anyone care to explain this at all?

GPGME just invokes gnupg in a subshell, right? And parses the
response? Not that this won't work, it just seems so inelegant. Does
anyone know of efforts to right an actual free-software library that
implements OpenPGP?

Perhaps inelegant was a little off the mark: how about inefficient?
The program has already done all this work to create data structs and
other binary data out of keys, and passphrases, and packets, and
whatnot, and now it has to convert them into ASCII and send them to
another program, just so that program can parse it all and turn it
back into data structs and stuff. There's this whole long step in the
middle that is essentially like climbing a set of stairs, then walking
back down.
The other thing that bothers me is that as a programmer, I know a well
written program shouldn't be too difficult to abstract into a library.
The fact that gnupg has been around so long and so many people have
expressed interest in a library, and yet there remains no
library...makes me question whether this is a philosophical decision
that a library is unnecessary, or the program is actually implemented
in an ugly and convoluted way, making the prospect of turning it into
a library daunting.

@_subject: Question regarding signature 
I have to wonder why you don't want to share your public key between
them? You understand that's the whole point of public-key-cryptography
schemes like those used by gpg, right? A public key is public, it's
meant to be shared and doing so does not cause any [feasible] security
