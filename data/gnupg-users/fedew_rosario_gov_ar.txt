@_subject: GPG with LDAP 
I'm trying to connect GPG with my own server key. To do this I think to
use OpenLdap but I can't search any information to help me to connect them.
The ldap server (slapd) was listen on port 389 (the default) as stand-alone
(not from inetd). The command
gpg --keyserver [my server] : 389  --send-keys [a key]
respond gpg: [fd 4]: read error: Conection reset by peer.
gpg: error sending to `[my server]:389': eof
Can you help me?
Where can I get more information?
          Thanks very much.
