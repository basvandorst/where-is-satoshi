I got a message that gpg failed to decrypt. It looked something like this:
When I saved this message to a file and ran gpg --decrypt on it, this is what it returned:
$ gpg --decrypt decryptme.txt
gpg: invalid radix64 character 3A skipped
gpg: invalid radix64 character 2E skipped
gpg: invalid radix64 character 2E skipped
gpg: invalid radix64 character 28 skipped
gpg: invalid radix64 character 29 skipped
gpg: invalid radix64 character 3A skipped
gpg: invalid radix64 character 2D skipped
gpg: invalid radix64 character 3A skipped
gpg: invalid radix64 character 2E skipped
gpg: invalid radix64 character 2E skipped
gpg: CRC error; FCF429 - 1C37C0
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=55)
However, when I deleted the Charset: field, it was able to decrypt it just fine. That is, when I made it look like:
Then gpg --decrypt worked just fine.
I'm running gpg version 1.4.6.

Thanks. I'll let the sender know.
By the way, he says it was using Thunberbird with Enigmail to create the message.
