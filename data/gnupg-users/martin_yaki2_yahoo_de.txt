@_subject: Why do I receive keys I wouldn't expect 
I issued the following command to receive my own public key for my other mail address "m.jachs at gmx.net".
gpg --keyserver sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys D870A352
and got the following output
gpg: requesting key D870A352 from hkp server sks-keyservers.net
gpg: key D870A352: "Martin Jachs (Regular email address) " not changed
gpg: key E66B2314: public key "Forest Jordan " imported
gpg: Total number processed: 2
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
My question now is: Why is the key for "me at inetz.com" imported? My key has only been signed by me and has no other user IDs than mine. The output from  shows this.
I encountered this while importing my own public key on another machine (with Kleopatra) and got surprised.
Thanks for any explanation!
