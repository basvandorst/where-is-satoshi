. . .
May one ask, is there any chance there will be such a
packaged version for OS10.3.x as well as for 10.4.x?
Presently, the very helpful mac-gpg project has gnupg
1.4.5 only for OS10.4; for OS10.3 is provided only the
less secure gnupg 1.4.1.  The uncontrolled outgoing
information flow required by the OS10.4 EULA
 makes using
OS10.4 undesirable.
I guess the same question applies to the gnupg 1.4.6 being
worked on now.

With full appreciation for your and everyone's work,
could I ask that, when posting, people be specific
which OSX they are talking about?  I'm still looking
for an easy way to get the latest gnupg but for
OS 10.3.9, not OS 10.4.x.  That is, a way which
doesn't involve having to install extraneous software
with its extra level of trust (eg Fink); and which
also avoids the Apple trend to asserting Micro$oft-like
control over users' computers
(cf eg  and
the links there, about 10.4, and one fears, 10.5 too);
and which also I can summarize in a "HowTo" recipe that
I can then use to distribute to academic and scientific
users who need to start using encryption and IMHO should
be encouraged to use open source.
Sorry for being wordy.

The latest macgpg.sourceforge.net "HowTo", v4.16,
says gcc 4.0.1 is needed.  That gcc seems to be
Apple-natively available only with OS 10.4, and not
installable in 10.3.9 (with reliable result) from
currently available XCode; gcc 3.3 seems to be
the highest in XCode for 10.3.  So..., what gcc do
you have and how did you get it?  (If the answer is

Reading that report, I see another GnuPG relevance:  the
issue of Computer Science being a profession (occasionally
debated in IEEE publications (at least a while ago), etc).
The characteristics of a "profession" are supposed to
include the existence of professional standards and ethics requiring adherence to the standards.  Open source may be
thought to finess this issue, working in the understanding
(hope ?) that including direct feedback from interested
community members (given the existence of community communication channels, and ideally including members with
professional status or attitudes) may be a substitute
for professional standards and ethics.  Are there refined
answers available to the question, how can someone like
"salaried programmers" (p.2) best state a claim that
GnuPG could serve as part of a professional solution to
the problem?

@_subject: Naming of GnuPG 
. . .
FWIW, one way to make this information clear would be
to make it part of a *theme* of information presentation.
For example, something like starting the FAQ, and maybe
starting any page which contains much information, with
something like (I'm quickly now trying to use grammatical
forms which are as globally language-neutral as possible):
"To use encryption wisely requires thought and making
decisions.  GnuPG is not an exception.  One decision is
which version of GnuPG to use."  And then bla bla bla
about what the different versions are like, and so on.
This could set up a cognition structure ("What is the
decision being worked on?") within which various
information, not only version information, could be
presented efficiently; and doing so might take some of the confusion out of applied PKI, leaving only the complexity.
For people who want a turnkey encryption package (which is
something to which I have no opposition), this kind of
theme (mantra??) could be a clue they'll maybe have to
ask for help from people who provide such, or else be
prepared to do some thinking on their own.
As I said, FWIW, & HTH.

Isn't one issue concerning requiring "full" names, zip
code, or similar, that you are not getting some good "completeness", but are rather giving some responsibility
for some aspects of verification to big organizations,
especially political ones like whoever keeps full name
records, etc?  So aspects of identity used to verify
some user are no longer under the control of the user
to the extent the user wants, but might be required to
be able to check with some central authority?  I think
gpg wants to respect user self-control?  And tries hard
to find good ways to make things work that way?

Christoph and call me Bob, some friends call me Alice,

That's the idea as stated in reports I have read.  Keep
in mind that waveform (sound or light) analysis is *very*
advanced, and not grossly expensive, these days.  I don't
recall at this time whether a baseline of each key's sound
has also to be recorded as known sound signature, but I'd
guess some tactic(s) could be devised soon enough to work
around that.
Sound analysis reportedly can also be used to identify
individual keyboard users, by rate and intensity patterns
of typing.  And, alternatively, I've read rate of succession
of keystrokes can be a clue to how close they are to each
other on the keyboard (or maybe at least how sequentially
accessible they are given some user's hand size and skill).
IIRC, this was said to be usable to simplify trying to read
an encrypted stream assumed to consist of keystrokes, by
considering the pace of character succession.
So two-fingered simpleton typing, or carpal tunnel syndrome
typing, may be a protection :-) .  And I guess, type at
least your passwords, etc, in a way strange for you and for
your keyboard.

drop down a curtain from the lid edges to block vision

curtain -- like a device in a 1960's USA movie :-) .
Of course, then it's pretty obvious you are typing something special so that's when the attacker turns

IIRC, the last time I read in detail about this, there was
bit-by-bit analysis of a full communication A->B, and unconfirmed bits were removed from the total exchange,
leaving confirmed bits to constitute the exchanged key
(ie the key offer sent from Alice to Bob).  The cause of
a bit being unconfirmed could be evesdropper "touching"{*}
the bit, circuit noise, etc, so of course DOS is obviously
available by evesdropping on all the bits.  (I'll not try
to state here the reasoning behind the confirmation process,
I'd have to look it up to satisfy myself my memory was good
enough to say anything publicly about it :-) .)
{*}:  I've seen lately, but not reviewed in detail, mentions
of successfully copying photon qbits, by tricky secondary
entanglements, this possibly enabling a functional equivalent
to store-and-forward of photons in their original entanglement state.  I think the information was maybe in _Nature_, within

@_subject: Teaching crypto to newbies (was: incompat.) 
[quoted from the "incompat..." thread, but replying
under RJH's new Subject]
  . . .
My own belief is that an aversion to thinking in terms of
"trust" may have some basis in common sense, given the wide
meanings and usual grammar of (the English language word)
[self advertisement] To quote a book [which I wrote FWIW;
complaints, comments, criticisms welcome :) ], because it's
not too wordy and says just what I want to say here:
    Risk is objective; security is subjective.
  ...
    Looking for risk is being awake; feeling secure is being
  . . .
    Trust is psychology.  "Stop Thinking, Be Happy, Trust Us" is a sales slogan.  Risk is the objective reality of a situation.
    The only connection between risk and trust is hope, or maybe
confidence one can evaluate and judge always correctly.
A newbie who is aware they don't know much, may well *feel*
the reason they need crypto is because not much is trustable,
and they *feel* a healthy anxiety.  And though it may well
happen to be that what is called "Web of Trust" is among
useful tools for dealing with the problems, one is not
teaching newbies psychological skills of telling how they
can trust or not, one is (should be) teaching how to *think*
weighing "risks" and showing how crypto is a tool to reduce risk.
So newbies may be due some slack when they don't do well with
learning "trust" as logic, because it isn't logic.

@_date: 2008-12-01 20:20:29

@_subject: Teaching crypto to newbies 
(First, understand I'm not claiming what I have to say about
this is any kind of perfect analysis, etc, rather it's like
trying to get hold of a bag of wriggling snakes and I'm
looking for the top of the bag so it can be twisted together
and grabbed hold of.  So FWIW:)
To a newbie that exercise may sound like (in quasi-logic terms,
and conflating all concepts which are like trust to "T"):
- I T Alice to T keys.
- I T that Alice has T'd Bob's key.
- How can I T that the key being presented to me as Bob's is T?
Compare something like, off the top of my head:
- I understand there's this key signing technique.
- There's always risk that someone will sign a bad person's
key, but Alice is pretty reliable (ie low risk).
- Via the key signing technique, I have info that Alice has
signed Bob's key (where experts have figured the risk is
really low that the key signing technique will produce bad
- How can I calculate the risk that this isn't really Bob's
The former seems to ask for logical certainty, with "T"
referring to people, processes, and things, and seemingly
concatenated to boot.  Perhaps very confusing to a newbie: "I mean, who is really certain of anything?; and who can
you really trust these days, anyhow?".
The latter reduces everything to an evaluation which a lot
of people have experience with. There are studies about
how poorly people may estimate actual risks, but they do
make such estimates.  So some of the problem might be
reducible to the general one of improving estimates of risk.
And for crypto, that can be at least partly stuff like FAQ
and rules of thumb and reports of experiences, etc, the
usual stories people go by when there is not science.  And
there is math of risk, though not at a level where most
likely newbies can do the math.  And risk is an idea that's
involved anyhow in the discussion of crypto techniques,
as mentioned above re bad signing.

One distinction is a place you control versus a place you
don't control.  For the latter, there is likely to be a
distinction about how much they are like being under your
own control.  A bank box to which you are the only person
holding a necessary key is supposed to be under your
control although in someone else's location; but your box
is exactly identifiable in bank records as being your stuff and the bank may have another key or the lock can be drilled.
An attorney--in the USA, traditionally--is supposed to be
acting as your surrogate and to be legally able to resist
attempts to have the attorney act against your intentions;
but probably maintains labeling of what stuff belongs to whom.
A friend is just that, a personal rather than commercial
relation, whom you are trusting to do what you want; for
that reason may not have to identify your stuff externally as
yours, relying instead on his or her own memory, and probably
would be harder to identify as someone who might have stuff
of yours than a bank or attorney would be (unless Google's
possible attempts to do universal tracing of affinity groups
are successful).  In any case, a strong passphrase is like
you having final control over access; and if you want to
backup the passphrase, you don't have to do that with the same combination of control and identification as you use
for the key info backup.

Of course, the issue is, who "you" refers to and how do
you know?  I believe many assumptions are made by many
people about this, just following natural human social
behaviors, and the tricksters are often good at sifting
through the assumptions to see where they can sneak in.
That is, maybe the way people often talk about this
is "Philosophy 101 stuff" (as RJH said), but the subject
is serious and important, IMHO, and the more people can
be aware of this on like a Philosophy 401 basis the less at-risk they will be.
As GM indicated, the base reality is "to treat the
certificate/gpg key as identity", then add anything, like
email, signed by the key as part of the identity, and
maybe sometime form a judicious belief about some
particular human person being associated with the key.
To be picky, anything else is assumptions; and eg in
a world full of *bots, long-established natural human
assumptions will have to be reevaluated.

I apologize.  College course numbering in the USA often follows
a standard scheme, where the 1xx series is for first year courses,
2xx is for second year, and so on; x0x would be the most basic
courses at a level, x1x would be more advanced at the level,
and so on; so 101 is the lowest level, least advanced introduction
to some topic.   RJH's "101" in this context was a common way to
criticize that something was superficial (if I understand RJH's
post correctly).  401 would be a fourth year course, and is a way
of asserting the topic can be significant.  I actually spent a
little bit of time deciding whether to say "401" or "501" (where
501 would be first year graduate level course, 601 would be
second year graduate, and so on), but decided that at a good
university a competence should taught by the 4xx level (and
not worrying about whether it should be 401 or 425 or 446 or
whatever ;-) ).

You could say, if when evaluating signed content you find any of these failing, it's a clue to be even more prudent.  That is, a strategy of teaching the prudence skill, and then adding:
what are activators to be alert for?  Ie, in this environment,
crypto signatures give some activators, and are definitely
better than nothing.  Like in the animal kingdom, rustling

I thought the original question was an interesting fundamental

of identifying the

parts together such that even if how you're doing it is
publicly known, and you are in very adverse conditions, you can still communicate at a level of privacy/security you want?
If nothing else, just asking the question in different ways
in different contexts maybe will sometime somehow stimulate
someone to think a little differently and come up with some
improvements.  IMO, I suppose this hope may be inspired by
Public Key Encryption having been devised so cleverly, and

Right.  One suggestion would be to try to identify as
many as possible tactics each of which by itself should
contribute some amount to security, then do one's best
evaluation of combining them pairwise all possible ways,
then triple-wise, etc (basic combinatorics) to see if their
effects when combined are at least not negative and hopefully
supportive of security.  Like the beginnings of crude science,
maybe even of some formal analysis.  Then use what looks best
so far, always keeping one's eyes open for more information.
Not a guarantee, and not pinning anything down tightly
(unless one gets lucky), but is one way of getting the
squirrels at least into a bag and not out chewing on

S has basic ordered acceptance list as Ps; as does each R as
Pr1, Pr2, and so on.  S maybe has personal-*-prefs list as
Pps; each R maybe does, Ppr1, Ppr2, etc.  The cipher used
for M is chosen by:  1st find simple intersection of the
ciphers listed in all the various P, this gives an unordered
set.  2nd, from the ciphers in that intersection set, choose
whichever ranks highest in Pps, if there is a Pps; otherwise
choose whichever shows up first in Ps; and in any case
ignoring all the Ppr1, Ppr2, etc and any ordering in the
Pr1, Pr2, etc.
Is this wrong?

Phrasing my answer now in terms related to the original
question starting this thread:  Simple file coherence can
be used to maximize likelihood of getting an untampered
file (assuming it is untampered as it exists at its download
source(s)).  The more different locations people are at when
they try downloads--and, if available, the more different
sites from which they can download--gives them distinct
download results which you can then compare to look for
coherence agreement.  This also makes it less obvious for a
network observer to know who is doing the downloading--the
"anonymity of the flock" (like flock of birds).  (On the
other hand, it may also give the impression to a network
traffic *observer* that so many people are downloading a
file that it would be worth the observer's effort to mount
a tampering MitM *attack*.)  Depending on the network
topology between your location(s) and the source location(s),
the problem the would-be tamperer/attacker has, of where to
position itself to be able to tamper, becomes harder.  But
this is just one more simple tactic to add to checksum
validations, file signing, etc.

@_subject: Questions about "--group" for group encryptions. 
. . .
I hope the following isn't just a waste of bandwidth, but:
Stepping back from the details (omitted from my quote of your
post) of your original question, and trying to clarify just
your first statement (quoted above):  Is what you want a full
many-to-many encryption/decryption functionality with minimum
keyage and non-static membership in "many"?
With public key encryption a basic practice is that encryption
(speaking only of encryption here, not authentication) is done
using public key, and decryption is done using private key.
By that model maybe what you describe is some PuK which "many"
knows and can encrypt with, and an associated PrK which "many"
also knows and can decrypt with?  And people can be added to "many" as you please?
Otherwise than this many-to-many, it might sound like what
you want is expandable/deflatable set of "ones" for mass one-to-one, which would involve the complexity and time to
manage encryption to a different PuK for each "one" in the
set, including each "one" in a currrent set would need to
know the PuK of every other "one" in that set.  And when a
new "one" were added to the set, in order to give them access
to past encrypted files somehow all previously encrypted
files would have to be reencrypted to the new "one"'s PuK so
the new "one" too could read the old files.
Alternatively, if what you want is one-to-many, you can see
how that could be arranged similar to either of the above.
The many-to-many might be considered a low-security plan
since any member of "many" could reveal the group PrK and
thereby make all future as well as past files insecure.
In the mass one-to-one, any "one" (one person, not one group,
since the real trust locus is person, not key) also could
break security by revealing the PrK used by that "one" for
the group, but they would have also to reveal individual
files as encrypted to their PuK in order for their PrK to
be used to decrypt.  And files encrypted after the revealer
left the group would not have been encrypted to the
revealer's PuK.
Related issues include how keys are communicated, and
where the files might be including to what extent files
might be communicated as distinct from being stored.

@_author: reynt0 
@_subject: Questions about "--group" for group encryptions. 
(responding to only the parts of ZZ's post which seem directed
to my prior post)
  . . .
I apologize for being too brief.  By "many-to-many" I meant
like a graph theory analysis, where "many" refers to people,
and "many-to-many" means like a bunch of people each one
of which knows a shared public-private keypair, used to encrypt
or decrypt files to which each member of the "many" group
has access.  Ie with some single en/decrypt action using one
single keypair anyone of many people can accomplish en/decryption
to many other people.  A mass "one-to-one" alternative would be
each individual member of the group needing to know an individual
public-private keypair for each other member of the group.  Ie
group en/decryption would be more like a mass of individual,
one-to-one actions.
Similar questions exist about file maintenaance.  Would files
be kept in some single location where each member of the group
would freely deposit encrypted files and each member would freely
access the files (a many-to-many way of doing file maintenance)?
Or would each member of the group keep only files he/she had
created and each other member have to know of each files' individual existence and location and access them there (a
kind of one-to-one); or maybe each member of the group would
have to send a copy of each encrypted file he/she creates to
each other member of the group, so each could maintain a copy
of every file (a kind of mass one-to-one file maintenance)?
I did mean as few keys as possible, thinking just of use for
your project.  But what you say, a "different key per individual"
and "one group keypair", sounds maybe like the following?  People
can in general have however many keypairs they want (which is
correct); and included among those keypairs would be a keypair that is issued by some administrator A and that is shared by
everyone to whom admin A gives it, and that is to be used just
for the group's files?  Yes, that is a possibility.
A public-private key "pair" means they depend on each other
to work together.  That is the basic idea of having public
and private keys in the first place.
I apologize.  I just meant the number of people in the group
could increase or decrease.  In this case, each single member
joining the group has to be dealt with as an individual who has
to be told the public key of each other member (to be able to
encrypt files for those others to be able to decrypt); and has to be able to decrypt old files using his/her new-to-the-group
private key, so all old files would have to be freshly
encrypted to the new member's public key.  And when any person
leaves the group all other individual members have to be
notified to stop using that person's keypair.
I can not answer that simply, so I'll hope my answers
above help.
One-to-many could be something like one administrator creating
all files and controlling access to them by many users, and
maybe the admin using a single keypair of which all members know
one part, which the members can use to decrypt the files; or
maybe the admin using a different keypair for each individual
group member.

A comment about social psychology, FWIW:
Just from talking to ordinary users, it seems to me that a
hesitation they have is not to get involved with something
they do not much understand, particularly when the people
trying to sell it to them are telling stories about bad things
happening to people because of stuff the people do not
understand.  People live their lives aware they are dependent
on a lot of stuff they can not control or really understand,
and cope by separating what is their own self and what is
Isolating the user's involvement in the system as much as
possible (eg to just locally running en/decrypt actions
including using whatever keys) might both (i) technically
protect users from bad stuff (including the bad effect
mentioned in the quote above) and (ii) make it more
comfortable for them to internalize into their own psychology
that there is this security stuff happening, because it is
OK since the experts are taking care of it for them and if
things go wrong, they (users) themselves are not to blame.
If users do not internalize the situation, they are unlikely
to want to go along with it, that is how psychology works.
Cf consider a strategy of aiming for something like technical
modularity which mimics users' psychological modularity about
the product.  The system designers' problem is that they have
to look at the overall system objectively technically as well
as to take the position of the individual user and look at
the system from that point of view, too.

According to NIST, yes. Further, other well-respected organizations (such as RSA Security) have publicly supported NIST's recommendations.
  . . .
key recommendations have been superseded by those in Practical Cryptography, which, to repeat, says ***replace "says" with
"estimates"*** RSA-2048 will be sufficient until the mid-2020s.
---re   Can any of the ciphers in GnuPG be brute-forced?

***In terms of current scientific understandings, the symmetric

The symmetric ciphers used in GnuPG are utterly immune to
brute forcing.  The Second Law of Thermodynamics places strict
  . . .
--re   Has GnuPG ever been successfully attacked?
We are unaware of any successful cryptanalytic attacks against
GnuPG. However, it is still susceptible to non-cryptanalytic
attacks such as malware, unauthorized physical access,
***social engineering attacks,*** and other such things.
---re   Should I use PGP/MIME or inline OpenPGP for my emails?
Unfortunately, there is no clear answer.
***move "for instance" from the end to the start of the 2nd
PGP/MIME has some distinct advantages over inline email. It
handles attachments automatically, for instance. It also separates
the signature from the document, which many people prefer over
  . . .
***Mail servers further confound things.  As a general tactic
against malware, any mail servers will strip off, alter, ..."
{and delete "as an anti-malware measure" from end of sentence]***
Mail servers further confound things. Many mail servers will
strip off, alter, or quarantine attachments as an anti-malware
measure. This has the effect of breaking PGP/MIME.
For many years GNU Mailman mailing-list software mangled PGP/MIME attachments in ways that broke signatures. These ***replace
"these" with "Some"*** old Mailman installations ***like that***
still exist today.
Cheers.  HTH FWIW

I was just guessing what they might be.  They showed as
"garbage" character groups in some browser rendering.
The idea is just to maximize usability to maximum audience,
of course, however that might be obtained.

In general, being able to examine variation of content within
uniformity of structure is also a way to legitimate the
specific content of interest.  If someone feeds you just one
answer "Special, just for you!", you may feel happy and relaxed,
but you missed the chance to see if the result you got makes
sense compared to other results.  The question of legitimation
is actually a broad and significant issue.
Referring to RJH's later long description of his work, might
this kind of consideration be one possible factor in "experts' liking tabular display more than newbies did?  Context would
mean more to people who know how to evaluate it.  Eg seeing
tabular output, they are always a little verifying the
current correctness of how the server is working, and so on.
If I understand RJH's description corectly, it seemed to me
that the interface he described was presenting a combination
of context and focus, including some user control over extent
of context (possibly not effectively clued control, but that
is not unusual for a pilot version of anything).

A current movie and old TV show in the USA makes me think
of, why not a masked western hero?  (Not a superhero.)  Like
the well-known Lone Ranger, who was on the side of good
against evil, on the side of law without being himself of
the law, etc.  He just liked his privacy and anonymity.
The image might even be of the masked cowboy on an archtypal rearing horse, fun and active, exciting.  I would be surprised
if the "Lone Ranger" media franchise had a copyright on that
image, they just used it like lots of western movies have
probably since commercial movies were invented, including Zorro,
etc.  The "cowboy" could be gender neutral, ie not displaying
any gender characteristics.  :-)
On the negative side, I wonder if such an image might be
accused of being too "activist"?  Also, I suppose the image
would have to be carefully done so it did not look like just
some bad guy.  Maybe wear a big white western hat rather
than a black hat?  <|8^)

Armadillo sounds cool, and like something a graphics

The pierros.de mask is exactly what masked cowboy
heros wear.  By itself it might have too many

As pointed out at the start of a gestural interface
programming book I have, Apple iOS made it possible
to use a fancy computer by using no more than the skills
of a chimpanzee.  Ie, simplistic behaviors matching
simplistic, even primitive, use-conceptualization.  Could
a model of using encryption be simplified enough that a
UI matching it would make a semi-chimpanzee feel happy
and comfortable using it?  If not, would encryption
be used widely even under threat of harm?  Unless maybe
the encryption were some kind of automatic and total?
IIRC during the time when electronic voting began to be in fashion, somebody (blackboxvoting??) posted a video
showing a chimpanzee successfully attacking the vote
accumulation process, actually using a Windows unit, IIRC.

. . .
Not to mention the situations where available intelligence
was used to do various cheats.  The level of skill is one
necessary aspect to evaluate, the uses of whatever skill
level may exist is another and separable aspect.
(And then there are the cases where people with public
reputations for great intelligence in the financial industry
have later been found to be anyhow mainly bold cheats.)
  . . .
I wonder if banks offer secure communication services to
premium cutomers these day, eg high-wealth customers of regular
or private banks.  I am surprised that is not a market niche
being pursued AFAIK, in which spending directly on developing
usable and private processes could be distinctive in the
market.  The individuals in that category whom I have known
enough to have some little awareness of their attitudes about
financial communications security have seemed not to have
such services available from their banks.

@_subject: [OT] Why are you using the GPG / PGP keys? 
. . .
  . . .
Speaking only from my own observations, the quick chatty
time-wasting email sequences seem to have migrated to
SMS/Twitter/whatever, like kids (or others with nothing
better to do) on the phone all the time.  But I would say
email was not a good way to do that anyhow, it just seemed
cheaper than old phone calls used to be before wide
existence of personal phone devices (cell phones).  As far
as I see, email is still used for stuff that takes thought
or attention or responsibility, even though it may be sent
using the same smart phone as is used for texting/tweeting/whatever.
