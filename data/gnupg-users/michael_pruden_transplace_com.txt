@_subject: gpg secure gateway feature 
Hash: SHA1
PGP used to have a feature called "Secure Gateway" that provided an
option of adding a subnet or gateway.  This feature enabled you to
create a VPN through a Cisco Access concentrator to a host inside the
VPN gateway.  I found a note in some online PGP documentation that
indicates that :
Secure gateways are not supported in PGP Freeware.
Is there any possibility, since network associates has thrown in the
towel regarding PGP that GPG could re-integrate this options into the
next release of GPG.  This would be very helpful, and provide a way
for common users to create VPN tunnels.
Please respond directly to my email address, because I an not a
subscriber to the news group.
