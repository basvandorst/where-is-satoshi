Hello Werner and all,
after seeing Facebook's public key a couple of days ago,
i was wondering if it's possible to enhance GnuPG in a
future version, so that it no longer allows someone to
sign a public key without approval of the owner.
As an example: Bob likes to sign Alice's pub key and
issues the sign key command, but instead of signing
the key directly GnuPG would create a "Signature
Reguest Certificate" which Alice reads and verifies
in GnuPG, thus allowing her to add Bob's signature
to her key. This mechanism, or a similar one would protect Alice's key from unwanted signatures.
Best regards

Thanks for your reply, all valid points.
However if my proposal would result in an enhanced OpenPGP file
format older versions could not sign such keys, while a never version
could read older or leagcy file formats. Same as with other software
applications. Current key servers would not be able to read/store
such enhanced format and needed to be updated too.

if i understand you correctly it would not help me if someone
would sign my key without my approval, so to speak.
What i meaned whith my initial post was that it should in the
future not be possible to sign someones pub key directly, to
prevent unwanted signatures. Sure one can revoke his/her pub
key, but how often would you like to do that if a "prankster"
has lot's of energy?
I also forgot to mention in my first post that it would also
require that Alice has to enter her secrets key passphrase to
authorize Bob's Signature Request Certificate, after validating Bob's request cert.
I think it would be a welcome addition for  a future version of

Ok, i understand but it helps not to solve the issue of unwanted signatures,
which i'm talking about.
Here's as an example the Facebook pub key:
Should now GnuPG been enhaned, or the Key Server's been updated,
similar to the pgp.com one.in order to allow such things not in
the future?

what harm do i see with "fake" signatures or signatures without permission?
Well, i think everybody here or elsewere can imagine by themselves how
"happy" one would be to receive unwanted signatures, depending on the

With all due respect, but why should a GnuPG user not been allowed to decide
by him/herself which signatures he/she likes to have on his/her pub key? I don't get it, seriously. BTW. maybe a language barrier, but an unwanted signature for me is a signature which contains crap or false content which does not help the Web of Trust in any way and which i or others don't like
to see on our public keys.
P.S. last post for today, getting late here.
