@_subject: Passphrases no longer found in keyring 
Wanted to follow forward with the below topic here as Patrick from
Enigmail suggested.
Quick Summary: CentOS 7 1708 enigmail/pinetry now asks for passphrase
all the time which was not the behavior prior to the recent update.
Yeah just ran through all the troubleshooting stuff and all works as
Pop up box with hello
key passhrase prompt and completion with gpg2 --sign
no errors
Will get in touch with the gnupg folks
