I tried --try-all-secrets but it didn't work:
$ gpg -d --try-all-secrets myfile.txt.gpg
gpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID xxxxxxxxxxxxx
gpg: decryption failed: No secret key
I guess I'll have to create a new public key with the same fingerprint? I've searched "gpg create public key with same fingerprint" but didn't get much luck. Could you please provide more detailed how-to instructions?

Hi Veddal,
Thanks for your reply. Sorry I meant to reply to an answer of my original post  but I'm a little confused how mailing list work so I might have created a new thread with the same title.
Basically, I've accidentally deleted ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg and now I'm not able to see any output from `gpg --list-keys' and `gpg --list-secret-keys'.
And I don't have any backup of my public key, so I would like to know whether it's possible to decrypt my files (I've still got ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d, which I think stores my private key?).
Tried your suggestions but didn't work for:
?  .gnupg gpg /home/rws/.gnupg/secring.gpg
gpg: WARNING: no command supplied.  Trying to guess what you mean ...
gpg: DBG: FIXME: merging secret key blocks is not anymore available
gpg: DBG: FIXME: No way to print secret key packets here
?  .gnupg gpg 6906A68A85C4AEAC
gpg: WARNING: no command supplied.  Trying to guess what you mean ...
gpg: can't open '6906A68A85C4AEAC'

It worked, and it was much easier than I expected, thank you so much!

I've accidentally deleted ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg and now I'm not able to see any output from `gpg --list-keys' and `gpg --list-secret-keys'.
Is it possible to still use my private key to decrypt previously encrypted .gpg files? Are private keys stored in ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d ? If so how can I make use of it?
gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.12
libgcrypt 1.8.4
Thank you in advance for your help.

Hi Micha?,
Thanks for your reply. However I've never uploaded the public key to any keyservers, is it possible to recover the public key from the private key (I still have ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d)?
