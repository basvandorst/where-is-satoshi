@_subject: How secure is GnuPG 
Make sure your "secure" computer is not connected to the internet. Now you
are only worried with the physical security of the premisis where the
computer is located.
Besides that, make sure you have a good firewall and virus scanner. Monitor
outbound packets from your computer to make sure there isn't a background
app running without you knowing it.
Once you get into tempest worries, it becomes clear that you really can't
secure your computer against physical (or geographically close) snooping
very well against a determined individual or government.

@_subject: Algorithms 
I'd recommend a good introductory reading (which is also quite
entertaining): "The Code Book" by Simon Singh. It talks about the origins of
symmetric ciphers and the basics (and the not-so-basics) of one-way ciphers
including the ones that are used in public key cryptography. RSA is
specifically covered along with the story of it's creation. As far as I know
ElGamal became popular after the book was published. DSA is covered in
theory, but not specifically (someone correct me here if I'm wrong. The book
covers the theory behind secure hash algorithms and presents some examples).
Since you mentioned you are a mathematician you might enjoy Applied
Cryptography by Bruce Schneier more. It goes into more depth, but leaves out
a lot of the history (so I'm told).  It centers more on the algorithms
themselves than the theory (again, so I'm told).
