ah, yes. Didn't think of that, but...
On my Windows system, I have Apache, PHP, MySQL, and Perl, GnuGPG all
running with *OUT* volume letters.
All config/ini files defined pathsa re based from "root" [/]. Of course,
all the files are on the same volume on that is not a problem.
If you look at my "unix" volume, it looks *exatcly* linke my Linux box at
work. Well, not exactly, but close enough for government work.
So, given that, I don't see why a GPG TO GO couldn't live on a CD or UDB
But I'd have to play and see.
Yes, I understand that POV. I worked (for a time) on the cryporights
project. Still put time in in the Squirelmail GPG project. I work across
the "hall" from Brian Peterson, the brain behind that [Squiremail
GPG]project so this securtiy chea ozzes around our office!  ;)
