Not quite. One hectogram is 100 grams (this is one "hekto" in
Swedish). One decagram is 10 grams.
I think the only place I've ever seen the prefix "deca" used is in the
Dune books by Frank Herbert, where they measure water in decaliters.

If I'm not mistaken, the thing that gpg tries (or will try) to protect
against in this case is the cleartext being written to temporary files
and such things. That is, protect the user from herself (by making it
hard to make mistakes), not protect the cleartext from the user.

You might have been bitten by the escaping. This example works on the
command line because the shell evaluates the command line args before
passing them to gpg. If you call gpg in a way that don't pass the args
through a shell, you should not be escaping quotes.
