@_subject: Import pubkey issue 
I'm having difficulty importing this public key:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.6.2
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
I'm running gnupg 1.2.4 on Windows XP Pro SP1a.
I have generated my public and secret keys. When I import the key I get the following:
C:\gnupg>gpg --import iGpubkey.txt
gpg: key 941BD48D: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
The key is a public PGP key (v 2.6.2). The first time I ran it the key imported, but without a uid. I tried adding one, but am confused as to how to associate a uid with a particular subkey, so I deleted the uid, and then deleted the subkey. Now the key won't import at all.
Since this is a PGP key, is this even possible?
