@_subject: What to do at failed integrity check? 
Hello everybody,
I?m having a problem getting GnuPG set up: I downloaded the tarball and
signature (for v2.0.30), then did the integrity check as described on
 using the packaged
version of GnuPG (1.4.something), and it failed with this message:
gpg: Signature made Do 31 M?r 2016 12:56:02 CEST using RSA key ID 4F25E3B6
gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
I already tried getting the files from a mirror ? same thing.
Now, the instructions on the linked webpage only say ?the file should be
treated suspiciously?. But what can I do now? Just use it anyway and
hope it?s not a real problem?
Best regards,
Simon Albrecht
