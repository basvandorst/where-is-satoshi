@_subject: Key usage on different OS's 
Greetings,   I would like to know how should I make use of my same keys (private and public) accesible from Windows as well as Linux?
  I have configured gnuoe and gnupg and would like to send and receive secured messages using OE and KMail.  I have configured both of these mail clients but I am using different private keys on both OS's
  I have imported the private and public keys from Linux to windows but do not know how to select that as the default keys for encrypting.
  Thank for the info you will be providing. Bye.
