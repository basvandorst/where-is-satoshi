@_subject: why people stick to pgp 6.5.8 
IMHO a lot of people are really glued to 6.5.8 because they want an  easy GUI and quick access. The technology behind does not matter much  to them as long as they are assured it is relatively safe.
Before the existence of GUI software like seahorse such users who  just want to encrypt, sign and decrypt their mail or files will not  be easily convinced to change. More over: those who do not have  smartcards to keep their keys safe, appreciated the easy way of  setting a path to their keyrings which they might keep on a mobile  device (floppy disk, usb-disk).
Following the discussions in this list, there are a lot of  interesting debates on how to secure data or to ensure the  authenticity of a message. All is necessary - but IMHO I think  relatively little is considered of enhancing the technology to make  it safe to the inexperienced user who definitely will not use  commandline etc.
I hope I have posted to the right mail address - I am not used to  participate actively in a list.
