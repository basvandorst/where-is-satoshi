@_subject: Exporting to server ldap plugin missing? 
I just installed GPA and when I tried to export my public key to the
keyserver, I got a message saying "There is no plugin available for the
keyserve protocol you specified"  It further described it as
ldap://keyserve.pgp.com (as well as the other ones I tried in the list)
Open ldap IS installed on my system and the ldap service is running. Can anyone give me a hit as to what's up?  I'm at the end of my rope
here.. :-(
