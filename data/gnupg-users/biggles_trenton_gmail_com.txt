@_subject: Future of GnuPG 1.x.x? 
Hello everyone,
My preferred flavour of GnuPG tends to be commandline 1.4.x (I use Ubuntu on one comp, but the others are WinXP), even if I also have Thunderbird/Enigmail, as well. It  suits my needs and I have established routines for using it.
However, while rummaging through the archiveson this leisurely Saturday, I came across two posts that made things a little unclear to me (quotes and links at the end of the mail).
Is the plan to retire 1.x sometime in a not too distant future (I'm not saying that I assume an actual time plan being set)? One post talk about "put into runoff", the other "We will keep maintaining GnuPG-1 versions".
The reason I ask is I have tried 2.x and even with various utf-8 settings, signed mail fail verification approx 50% of the time for others as my client does with theirs. English works fine, but it seems mail containing Swedish/Danish/Czech letters (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, etc) get mucked up.
Anyway, just curious to know how the thoughts/plans ahead are.
Best regards,
Sin T.

Right, that is the current plan. Maintaining two stable branches is

"We will keep maintaining GnuPG-1 versions because they are very useful for small systems and for server based applications requiring only OpenPGP support."

Hello everyone,
Sorry I haven't responed earlier, summer, life and all that, but thank you for all your input.
Haven't completely solved the thing about ANSI vs UTF-8 / OpenPGP/Enigmail/commandline etc signing, but we who use UTF-8 as default usually manage to verify each others' signatures without problems.
As for the future about GnuPG 1.4.x, again, thanks for all the input and you've made me wiser. :)

@_subject: how vulnerable is "hidden-encrypt-to" 
I got a bit intrigued by this discussion, having posted a question once
relating to it.
I'm not sure if this input really shows anything or is of any real
contribution to the discussion, but to me it seems all recipients,
including your own are hidden for you when you decrypt a message or a
file? (You get how many keys, but only ID 00000000 for each).
Note that the file was not signed.
So I made a test in my "GPG workshop" (where I have four 'dummy' keys I
created just for testing things out). A file was encrypted with
--hidden-recipients ( -R ); a friend's key, one of my dummy keys [key
four], playing the recipient and sender, plus two keys serving as 'red
herrings', random keys I downloaded from The Guardian (UK newspaper)
and Deutsche Telekom. I then ran a --decrypt and got this output:
gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [key one] ...
gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [key two] ...
gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [key three] ...
gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [key four] ...
gpg: cipher algorithm 122 is unknown or disabled
gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [key one] ...
gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [key two] ...
gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [key three] ...
gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [key four] ...

gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [key one] ...
gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [key two] ...
gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [key three] ...
gpg: anonymous recipient; trying secret key [key four] ...
gpg: okay, we are the anonymous recipient.

@_subject: Gnupg-users Digest, Vol 107, Issue 24 
For Android the OpenPGP app APG is available.
Of course, I am certain people on this list may have opinions regarding
the wisdom of using it. ;-) The source code is available at
Then again, I must confess I only keep public keys and no private ones
on the app. I find it pretty convenient to be able to encrypt notes or
files while "on the move/road/run", especially if I need to store them
temporarily at a cloud service.
Also, my default mail client on Android is K-9 which integrates pretty
nicely with the APG, so I can send messages to those friends that are
actually using GPG/OpenPGP. (All two of them).

Well, "he" nor "we" was/were actually the first to use this definition,
nor is it actually cherry picking;
Apart from the two definitions, there is actually an old

@_subject: OpenPGP goes TV in Germany 
this may be interesting for some of the readers of this list:
Monday and Wednesday next week (15th, 17th) my OpenPGP course at Berlin
Linux User Group
will be visited by three or four German TV crews plus one Ukrainian. So you
at least don't have to be (too) afraid that technical nonsense gets
broadcasted... ;-)
The first report will be on air in the ARD Nachtmagazin on Monday, part of
the tagesthemen probably the next day. I do not know yet when N24 and ZDF
are going to broadcast this. But I will announce that when I know it here:
The rather strange reason for that is that they actually wanted to shoot at
Cryptoparties but their paranoid organisers (slightly misunderstanding
their own aim of making the general public familiar with crypto) didn't
allow that.
We jump at the chance and change my "once per month with small group"
OpenPGP-only event to a complete Cryptoparty offer with one real event per
week (with rotating subjects, only one per event).
Furthermore we (or at least me for OpenPGP) will offer to teach future
instructors for other events and offer them to gain (supervised) experience
with our course before they give one on their own. This should help getting
more people willing (and qualified) to do that.
Obviously I am not really neutral in this assessment but I consider OpenPGP
the lead technology for making the public familiar with all the Cryptoparty
stuff (crypto on the one hand, anonymization on the other).
I will use the remaining time to improve my site
 de/But anyone who understands German is
invited to have a look at it and make suggestions for improvements befor it
gets hit by the big wave next week...
Heading at ten million OpenPGP users in Germany in ten years...
As a Scandinavian living just slightly east of ?sterreich, I can only say
"Viel Gl?ck!" :)
Will check what I can see online, locally by one of those soon to be
criminal as well as for now, strangely legal services, like VPN. :)

Hi Julian H. Stacey
I suspected it would muck up, though I wasn't sure. Unfortunately I replied from my "smart" phone, which we all know are consumer products and not true work tools, unlike PCs. Which we all should prefer anyway. :)

Sorry if this is wordy, but I want to make sure I cover most details.. :)
I thought I had grasped the concept of all various key parts, but now I'm getting a bit unsure..
A GnuPG key has a private key and a public key. When you first create it, you get these two parts, and a different kind of "keys", a primary key (usage: SC), and a sub key for encryption (usage: E).
You can add and revoke sub keys, as much as you want, as well as UIDs, for when you change or add mail addresses, Jabber IDs, etc.
You can also make a version of your key where the primary key is deleted and you have two sub keys, one for encryption (usage: E) and one for signing (usage: S).
But so far, I've always thought that "changing password for a subkey" was changing the password for, say like in the second example above? You have a version B of your key, with a different password than version A (where the primary key is still present)? Not that one particular subkey per se has a different password?
If I were to create two different signing subkeys (usage:S), not sure why, but still, I could give them different passwords?
If you _can_ assign a separate, different password to a particular subkey, I assume it is done under --edit-key, but how?
Just for the record, I use GnuPG 1.4.13 on Windows XP and Linux Mint 14 Nadia. I tend to use commandline 90% of the time, but for text snippets on my work PC, I also use Cryptophane. On my work PC I run it locally (local.bat with set GNUPGHOME=.) from inside a mounted TrueCrypt volume. Cryptophane is also set to 'no-config'.
I have four versions of my key (RSA):
1. "Main key", which is only stored offline, and which contains primary key and all past and present subkeys, including revoked ones. (None so far). This key has passphrase A.
2. The key I use, which is kept inside the TrueCrypt file mentioned above. It has my current subkeys for encryption and signing, but not the primary key. This key has passphrase B.
3. A travel key, basically GnuPG 1.4.13 and Cryptophane on a USB thumbdrive. It only has my public key.
4. Same as 3. on my work mobile, using Android and APG 0.8. Only public key present.
The reason for 3 and 4 is that I discovered that during the day, I more often want to _encrypt_ something to myself, a file or a short piece of text, in various situations. It can be before uploading a diary note or a customer file to Dropbox or pretty much just anything. Decryption happens later, when at my desk or in more secure environments, using key version 2.
This is also based on something that may have been acknowledged on this list more than once; That at the end of the day, you encrypt to yourself much more often than you do to other people, who can't be bothered with encryption anyway. ;)

Ah, so even if technically simplified, my previous understanding was basically correct. Thank you very much for this clarification, very useful!
Which is basically the same then, though I may have fewer boxes (3, with mobile included, if we really should count it as a box) :)
+1! The day the practical possibilities of this dawned on me was a day of awsumness.

@_subject: Decrypting symmetrically encrypted text in Command Line (CL) results 
Hello everyone,
I've tried to find info regarding this but no real luck so far. It was discussed in the thread "encryption/decryption without files", but I haven't found a reply there that covers 'symmetric decryption'.
And yes, I am aware of plaintext, shell, bash, etc.
These are generally short text snippets, which can be considered internal, not even confidential (I'm not familiar with the names of levels up to "Ultraviolet Top Secret", but this would barely reach "Just don't forget too many print outs on the tube" level. :) )
We use it mainly for small txt files stored in the cloud, some things sent over Google or stored temporarily in some docs at Google Drive, etc.
Anyway, I often use -ac in command line to encrypt these text snippets.
I write the text or message, finish with Ctrl+Z (We use Windows at work), and copy the encrypted text.
One thing I would like to do is the opposite, however, but I haven't figured out how to, yet.
If I want to decrypt a short text snippet, I have to
  1. copy the snippet
  2. paste it into a txt file
  3. save the file
  4. use "gpg -d file.txt"
(The text is then read in the CL window, I have no interest in this case to save the decrypted text, just read it and e.g. check a reference)
Is it possible to replace steps 2 and 3 by pasting in the text in the CL?
I've tried "gpg [Enter]", but I always get the message "decryption failed: bad key" as you can see below.
Everything below the encrypted message happened automatically when I pasted in the text first time, though next time it did wait for me to supply the passphrase, with same "bad key" result, however.
Note that the last line "-----END PGP MESSAGE-----" disappears. Also, the prompt does not return to the standard ">", until I have done a Ctrl+Z or Ctrl+C.
  >gpg
  gpg: Go ahead and type your message ...

  gpg: TWOFISH encrypted data
  gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
  gpg: decryption failed: bad key
As I wrote in the subject line, this is when using symmetric encryption (as you can see), since we use that in these particular cases.
It does work with asymmetric encryption, though the workflow is a bit dodgy even there, I think? The END PGP MESSAGE line disappears here as well and the first failed attempt for the passphrase happened without my input too.
