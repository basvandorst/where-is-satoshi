@_subject: gpg from bash/expect/cron 
Hello all,
I have a bash script that calls an expect script that accomplishes a
download and decryption of a file all in one fell swoop.  When run from a
console the scripts work perfectly.  When run from cron I get the
following error:
spawn gpg -d -o  gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
send: invalid spawn id (3)
I have a default key (my only key) setup in the options file, but that
doesn't help.
Any ideas?
