Can someone please explain this line of an error code I'm receiving?
gpg: Ohhhh jeeee: mpi crosses packet bordersecmem usage: 0/0 bytes in 0/0 blocks of pool 0/16384
I'm unfamiliar with the term 'Ohhhh Jeeee'.
This is working as part of a script on a Solaris box. I'm guessing it might have to do with the entropy situation.

@_subject: GPG and PGPTools 
Hello all,
I have a small question. HAs anyone here been able to make the Freeware
PGPTools hook into M$ Exchange and decode GPG encrypted messages on the fly?
Right now when I ask PGPTools to decrypt the message directly from
Exchange, I get a 'No PGP data found' error. However, if I save the message
as a text file and then run the PGP Decrypt tool from the floating pallet,
it decodes it properly.
I'm planning on deploying this to a number of less than technical users,
and wold like to have the functionality all work with in the Exchange
If anyone has made this work under Win95/98, please just drop me a line
saying 'yes'. I would just like to know if this is possible, or if the
Freeware PGPTools just simply will not recognize the GPG encrypted message.
