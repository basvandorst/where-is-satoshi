@_subject: ASP Shell and GnuPG 
Hello all,
     I'm trying to get GPG to work using the Wshell object in ASP. It worked just fine on our Windows 2000 Server, however, after the recent move to Windows 2003 Server, we're running into issues. I've verified permissions on all files needed but when I run the command, I get an error code 2 returned. Any help would be greatly appreciated, the code used to test is below:
Set WshShell = Server.CreateObject("Wscript.Shell")
command = "gpg --decrypt-files ""c:\inetpub\gpg\keytest.gpg"""
response.write "Exit Code: " & WshShell.run(command, 1, true) & ""
set wshshell = nothing
