@_subject: Problem with migration from 1.2.4 to 2.0.9 
this might be related to some changes they made in the keys a while
back.... I think PGP V6 used one key for both signing and encrypting but
if you look at the keys now you see each key has a sub-key as well....
one used for signing and the other for encryption.
so i don't see how you can bring the old style key forward if i'm right
about the change
I just junked the keyring from PGP658WIN ( the old MIT version ) .  actually I kinda like the idea of using separate encryption and signing
keys, but too: we should all consider how we will implement our policy
on expiration dates. when my key expires I will generate a new one and
upload it to the keyserver. hopefully the keyserver will be smart enough
to understand that I need to supersede my key and not give mu a bunch of
'duplicate record' crap.  if it gives any trouble in this regard oh
well: it just ain't ready for use yet.

(1) apply the Strike 3, you're out rule.  any password gate should apply

a) Secret questions are NOT a good idea as these facilitate guessing.

b) Password management package could be a good idea. WE HAVE BEEN ASKING
INDUSTRY FOR THIS FOR YEARS AS "SINGLE PASSWORD".  You enter it ONCE:
when you log on.

sec delay before next try.  think what this does to a brute force

what difference does it make if I am discussing a server logon or the

but for the .zip the delay after bad makes more sense
if i delay responding to a bad password for 1 second the speed of your

tries/sec. and there's no real reason i wouldn't make it 10 sec after

yep. Phil Zimmerman noted that in his original essay on PGP.  If you

@_subject: Keylogers 
*That would be 100% correct.*
This is why we need the Software Audit Tool I've discussed at times on
various boards.  The Software Audit Tool will need to be on a separate,
read-only, bootable media such as a DVD.  On boot-up it would mount the
C: drive of the target system and then pull a software inventory. When
complete this inventory would be audited, checking the data-time stamp
and CRC of every executable software in the inventory.  This would be
checked against OEM specifications and system owner's noted.  System
Owners Notes should specify: what packages are supposed to be on this
this is the only way to certify a system: a running system cannot be
used to certify itself.  for those who don't understand this an old and
common malware trick is to replace the directory list program.  when the
system owner types dir c:\windows\*.* the modified dir list program
simply fails to report the presence of the malware programs, instead
adding the space taken by the malware back into the reported
free-space.  the original dir program is hidden someplace on the c:
drive and then reported on the dir list with its orignal directory
info.  if you dump the program out you get this back-up copy; but when
you run it -- the bad copy runs.  the system-- has had a bug purposely
installed,-- one with produces INCOROUT (incorrect output) ,-- it has
been "pwn3d".
Wolfgang Stiller (Stiller Research ) did an inventory program as I've
described -- for DOS.  We need one for Win/7. when we get it we can
begin certifying systems and once that is underway we can begin
identifying failure points which still need corrections.

I had worked with Wolfgang Stiller's program on DOS systems earlier.  and yes:  it did create false positives. and it is easy to see how some
practices in software  distribution and maintenance will tend to create
these false positives.
in view of the need however it is and has been my feeling that this is a
topic that needs to be pursued although I do not see is successful
solution as probable without direct vendor support.  particularly in the
software inventory listings.
we shoud recognize that this inventory process is most critical for the
operating software itself: the software that is allowed to run in RING0.
In a properly secured O/S an application program can't do any damage to
its host O/S.  with this in view we can take a limited approach to the
project at the start and expand it to cover application software where
vendors agree to sign on.
at all times it will be important to keep the objective in mind: we want
to certify the operating software on a selected computer system so that
we can be assured that our Encryption Software -- PGP, HTTPS, S/FTP &c

yep. when i was working OS/MVT I used to hate people who wanted to
install an SVC. and so it is with Win7: if your app needs to modify the O/S then your
app has to be vetted just as though it was the O/S.  because when it
"hooks in" -- it has to be treated that way.
obviously you would not want to allow any and every app program to do
that... if you did you'd have a mess on your hands. Don't we?
I have always felt the registry should be for the O/S use only.  App
Programs should use their own .ini files.
one of the things we have failed to recognize is that the computers for
hobbyists, experimenters et al are different from the computers for
commercial/network/business applications.

you could upload a revoke certificate. hopefully they keyserver is smart enough to discover multiple hits on a given fingerprint as a result of a search... it would need to first search for the key by whatever search text was provided, and then search for hits on the fingerprint... if there is a revoke cert then you want to return that.  if they key was superseded by a later update it should provide the last updated copy.
interestingly they keys have a valid from/to date range, but no revision date... we may have to just carry out some experiments

@_subject: Understanding --status-fd output 
there are definitely some confusing terms in play here
from using GPG4WIN I note: a signature may be marked:
    valid|not valid
    Trusted|not Trusted
from my observations: "vaid" should really read "recognized"
the signature is "recognized" IF:
    I signed it
    someone whose key i have marked fully trusted signed it
    two or more parties i have marked marginally trusted have signed it
"Trust" or "owner trust" refers to whether I trust the owner of a key
sent to me.  this trust can be
    ultimate ( I only trust myself "ultimately" )
    full: I trust this party to thoroughly vet any keys he signs
    marginal: I'm not sure about this guy; he's probably OK
    unknown: I havn't got a clue
Clearly: you cannot establish a Trust Model in a large population which
is the fundamental error made in x.509
IN ADDITION: you will note that on an x.509 certificate there is a
second trust flag: for software. This is CRITICAL to the security of
Authenticode which is used for software updates

@_subject: Default GPG Encryption Algorithm (symmetric cipher) is? 
Many Thanks to Tiago Faria for excellent notes on editing GPG Keys.  I had found neither GPA nor
Kleo to have all of the edit capability that should be available for a
key and in particular on the User ID and preferences for symetric ciphers
the key to this is that you use command line ( no problemo ) and then
use the --edit-key to open a dialog.  I was used to using PGP and in
that every command has its own --command format
the one thing that Tiago didn't touch on in his example
For example:
setpref S9 S8 S7 S3 H10 H9 H8 H11 Z3 Z2 Z1 Z0
will configure a UID (these preferences are UID-based) to use:
Cipher: AES256, AES192, AES, CAST5, 3DES
Digest: SHA512, SHA384, SHA256, SHA224, SHA1
Compression: BZIP2, ZLIB, ZIP, Uncompressed
Hope this makes it easier for you to understand and edit to suit your
I think I didn't miss anything, but feel free to correct me :)
is: how does S9 equate to AES256 ?  there has to be a way to find the
equivalence between the verbose codes and the short hand
The User ID on a key may ( at the owner's option ) contain more than
just the e/mail address.  If I remember rightly PGP will search any
matching string in a key to use as and identifier so this could be a
phone number or an employee number.  Phone numbers, employee numbers,
and e/mail addresses all tend to change  when we change our affiliations
so this would leave a question as to the best way to identify a key
For the purpose of ENIGMAIL the e/mail address would seem to be the best
choice.  Even though I am changing e/mail address or even though I have
several e/mail addresses -- the public keys for these are on the server
and if you address mail to me via ENIGMAIL it will find the key
associated with the e/mail address you are using.  All Good.
Happy New Year All!

I had used the above -- obsolete/MIT distribution of PGP for some time. It is unfortunately, obsolete: it had a much better GUI than GnuPG,
especially when you wanted to examine a key.
I think though that PGP has an assortment of different levels of
support; the above being only valid through Level 6.  someplace int he
documentation I think I remember seeing that for the current GnuPG to
support level 6 keys you have to set some kind of switches. dunno; i stopped researching this and switched entirely to GnuPG.
I don't like GPA and I don't like Cleopatra either.  In the first place
you should need only 1 key-manager.  Evidently GPA didn't cut it and so
they tried Cleopatra and missed with that too

"Unverified signature".  I selected the option to load your key from the

following that event THUNDERBIRD reported "untrusted good signature" --
as it should.  after I signed it TWICE with MARGINAL trust -- it turned
green ( GOOD Signature ) -- as it should.
I think there may be some confusion with the names we use -- related to
    * key validity
    * owner trust
As I currently understand things: the *owner trust* indicates whether I
trust a key to sign for other keys and this can be fully, marginally, or
not at all.
key valididity indicates whether i have properly vetted the actual owner
of a key-- again fully, marginal, or not at all.
    * when i first received your message THUNDERBIRD reported UNVERIFIED
      signature
    * when I downloaded your key from the server the message changed,
      showing UNTRUSTED signature
    * when I signed the key showing casual checking the UNTRUSTED
      message remained
    * when I signed you key a second time with a different master key
      then the status wento GREEN: Good Signature.

btw, the gnupg user list would like you to add a cc to the list on these
messages. they can probably get all of it from the quoted text blocks
but nonetheless the list would like us to share properly
in answer to your question: if you are administering keys for a group,
say 20 or more people and you have members who come and go -- you may
need to revoke a signature
for example, let's say Tom Newguy joins our group. how do we tell the
current member of the group and provide them with a certified copy of
Tom's key?
what do we do when Tom leaves the group?
Let's start at the beginning: Tom is joining our group today. I have
signed for his key. I am going to use the send key by email option of
Thunderbird's OpenPGP Key management dialog to send his key. If this is
done right you will be able to accept his key directly from his e/mail.
Let me know how this goes. Alternately I could send his key to the
server but I don't want to clutter the server with a junk key.
let me know what happens

@_date: 2011-03-21 08:52:31
@_author: Mike Acker 
@_subject: KEYSERVER; Trust Model 
Very good question.  If you apply trust to Tom Newguy's key you are
indicating whether you trus him to sign for other keys.
That's now what we want to do in this scenario: Tom Newguy is the new
person in the group and I'm acting as the Group Security Facilitator
As a result:
    * if you load my key and mark it fully trusted , and
    * you then receive Tom Newguys key with my signature attached, then
    * when you open Tom Newguy's message the system will show good signature
If, OTH you mark me MARGINALLY trusted Tom Newguy will need TWO
signatures on his key before he can go green
So what you would do: download my key from the server and set a trust
level.  accept Tom's key from the e/mail.  then read Tom's message.  Try
setting the trust level on my key to different levels and then re-read
Tom's message: see what affect the setting has.  Basically the question
you are playing with is: should I trust Tom because Mike signed for him?

@_date: 2011-03-21 12:09:59
@_author: Mike Acker 
@_subject: KEYSERVER; Trust Model 
OK, Good!!
If you follow along you see: when Tom joins the group I get his key from
him and sign it. and then send it to the members of the group. If the
group members trust me to do this then they will get "good" signatures
from Tom.
Now: when Tom leaves the group I send you a certificate revoking my
signature from his key. this doesn't make his key dis-appear: it just
lets the group members know that Tom is no longer a group member.
I'm going to have to work on this a little though: because I have the
KEY PAIR on this machine when I try to generate the revoke certificate
it tries to revoke Tom's key rather than my signature from his key. VM
anyone? tee hee.
Kleo did let me export Tom's secret key. So what I'll do is: delete
Tom's key completely; import his public key and sign it and then
generate his revoke cert. theoretically then i can re-import is private
key and be back to square 1.

HOWEVER: If I have only Tom's public key on my keyring -- which would be
normal -- the software will not allow me to generate a revoke
certificate -- to revoke my signature from his key.
Group members could easily DELETE Tom's key based on a letter of
Instruction (LoI) -- but his key could easily return from a keyserver --
if a group member had uploaded it...
Alternatively Group Members could DISABLE Tom's key.  I will have to
test to find out if that would prevent a new download from a keyserver

@_subject: Controlling Group Membership with PGP Keys 
VM Anyone?
Clearly the design of the PGP key and its trust model does not apprehend
indicating Group membership
it occurs to me that controlling group membership is going to need:
   1. a Group Keyserver under the control of the Group Administrator
   2. Option to use the Group Keyserver exclusively for access to Public
      Keys
the 2d point could be related to an e/mail address and implemented in
THUNDERBIRD, or, perhaps better to set up a VM with a THUNDERBIRD
installed for Secure Group Communication Only.
Perhaps we need Windows7 to become more like MVS
The administrator could set an expiration date on his key-- which should
cause his authentications to expire,-- but what time frame?  30 days? That might be decent as far as getting rid of Tom but would cause
another problem: all the members of the group would have to get all the
keys re-certified every 30 days
Note: the 'group' might not be a corporation where everyone wil be using
an email address of a predictable pattern such as (e.g.) tom_newguy at acme.org

in thinking about this it is clear that PGP ( and thus GnuPG ) wasn't
intended to verify group membership.  this could be an up-coming RFC
but for today i'm going to advise my group that the authentication
simply indicates the sender is who he(she) says he(she) is, nothing more.
when i receive a message from Tom Newguy I can look at my Group Mailing
List to see if he's a member,  or not.  the group administrator will
need to send messages when there are adds, changes, or deletes to the
group membership list and this can be done in the ordinary manner. i'll
recommend DEACTIVATING obsolete keys rather than deletes -- this should
prevent folks from accidentally downloading a key that has been dropped
( i need to test this yet ) .
the RFC would allow Thunderbird to associate a key server with an e/mail
account and would provide for the group administrator to maintain the
keys in that server.  this would recommend folks to use a dedicated
e/mail account for the access controlled group but i don't see that as
horrible issue -- not like asking folks to set up VM --

Quick and Dirty solution: If I have each member of the group set up an
address book for the group then it will be straight forward for the
group administrator to send adds, deletes, and changes pertaining to the
content of that book.
and folks can set up a filter rule in THUNDERBIRD to move messages from
non members into a junk folder and this can pertain to their group
e/mail account only.
this will provide the sort of active regulation that i am looking for

that idea has a lot of merit: it allows the group administrator to
distribute the access list -- which i what is needed in maintaining
group security.  i'll have to experiment.

with chip makers playing with chips having 64 cores printed in silicon...
someplace i read the ratios on this,-- if you make the key a little
longer the key gets much harder to break.  in public key encryption
though you have to factor the product of the two large prime numbers --
which i'm told is no easy task.  i've often wondered about this as lists
of large prime numbers are not hard to come by... so-- start someplace
and start running divides... trouble is though you can't use the
hardware instruction set: the numbers are way to large
what does an x64 chip do? divide a 64 bit integer into a 128 bit
dividend to yield a 64 but quotient and a 64 bit remainder? dunno but
you have to do the same thing but using what? a 2048 or 4096 bit dividend?
(I'm not a mathematician)
what if they put 8192 cores on a chip? who would have such a machine?
NSA.  the smart money would bet they would have it

@_subject: Group Membership Keyring 
I really liked the idea of having the Membership Secretary sign a Public
Keyring for the Group Members and then to circulate that keyring to the
How to implement though, as members will need an additional keyring for
each group they have a membership with.
Ideally the keyring would be used in place of an address book and
associated with an e/mail account.  this thinking is based on the idea
that a Secure Group would expect its members to have a dedicated e/mail
account reserved for the use only by the members of the secure group.
i'll have to try some poking around and run some tests.  I don't see
making VM a requirement as a workable solution.

@_subject: PGP and "Smart" Cards 
The Basic Error is in giving the merchant your credit card number.
You are spreading that number all over Boston and the thugs are gonna grab it and
help themselves.  The only surprising thing is that this doesn't happen more
often.  All that a thug needs is a Merchant Account with PCI and he can start
using all the Credit Card numbers he wants to buy on the black market forums. Run off a few million bucks and head for Bulgaria. AK-47s are on sale there this
week only ( tee hee ) .
Corrected Thinking: DO NOT GIVE OUT YOUR CARD NUMBER.
Smart Card Technology -- or your iPhone can make this possible.
Instead of you giving the merchant your account number the merchant should send
an invoice to your Smart Card -- or to the PCI App in your iPhone
Your Smart Card -- or the PCI App in your iPhone -- could then encrypt the
invoice together with authorization for payment and forward this cipher text back
to the merchant's Point of Sale Terminal (POST).  The merchant would NOT be able
to decrypt this cipher text as it would be encrypted to the PCI: to the financial
institution that issued your SmartCard.  The POST would forward the cipher text
to the PCI.  The PCI would decrypt the cipher text and verify your signature.  On
approval PCI would forward a paid copy of the invoice back to the POST and an EFT
credit to the Merchant's account and an equal EFT debit to your account.  The
POST prints the paid invoice and off you go with your new egg beater and don't
forget the receipt ( called the paid invoice here ) .

what do I give it?  I found gpg in the /usr directory and I can run GPG

Thanks.   I had received your reply and posted a note to the list
earlier.  The results are successful.  You may notice I'm writing from
the UBUNTU system for this message.   I'm not sure why you seem to be
receiving the question over and over: I sent it once on ENIGMAIL list
and once on GnuPG User list.
I'll try signing this one...
Note: my earlier key has expired.  For that reason I've generated an
uploaded a new RSA key to the keyserver
so-- you may need to request the new key from the keyserver.

IMHO(FWIW) it is unlikely, at best, that anyone will attack your cipher
text.  haquers work by getting malware into the endpoint computers
hence it is that requiring signatures on software distributions is one
of the most critical topics on the table today

a lot of information has been reported recently
regarding NSA an back-door entries behind digital encryption
attached are some notes I offered recently on the MINT forum
i have altered my cipher preference list as follows
TWOFISH CAST5 BLOWFISH 3DES AES AES192 AES256 CAMELLIA128 CAMELLIA192
based on recent revelations we should probably not use any commercially
offered cipher

it is important to understand that the specification i have in MY key is
addressed to any party which may be sending to me.  I am essentially
telling the other party: use TWOFISH as my first choice.    Now: if the
sender encrypts the message to more than one recipient then ( if i'm
reading the documention right ) the selection the first supported option
common to both recipients
in the light of new information about NSA and NIST this is an
interesting topic

@_subject: Pgp key 
first off, are you Windows or Linux ?     In Linux you should have GPG
installed by deafult; in Windows you will need to go download gpg4win
and install it
once you have gpg in your system then get the Thunderbird e/mail
client.  again, in Linux (Ubuntu, or Mint at least ) -- Thunderbird will
already be present.   In Windows, you have to go download it and install it.
setup and test your e/mail account.   add your buddy to your address book
Next you need to add the ENIGMAIL plug-in to Thunderbird .   In
Linux/Mint(15) I had to download the plug-in and install it manually;
Windows or Ubuntu installed from the get -add-ons menu
Next you need to generate a key-pair .  use the KeyManagement option of
Thunderbird from the OpenPGP drop-down
Next you need to use key-management from Thunderbird to import the key
that your buddy sent you
now you can send a message to your buddy.   after you have the message
ready click the OpenPGP pull-down and check encrypt,sign,use pgp-mime,
and ignore recipient rules
the e/mail address you send to needs to match the e/mail address he has
on his key

I'm trying to understand what the manual means:
    setpref string
        Set the list of user ID preferences to string for all (or just
    the selected) user IDs. Calling setpref with no arguments sets the
    preference list to the default (either built-in or set via
    --default-preference-list), and calling setpref with "none" as the
    argument sets an empty preference list. Use gpg2 --version to get a
    list of available algorithms. Note that while you can change the
    preferences on an attribute user ID (aka "photo ID"), GnuPG does not
    select keys via attribute user IDs so these preferences will not be
    used by GnuPG.
        When setting preferences, you should list the algorithms in the
    order which you'd like to see them used by someone else when
    encrypting a message to your key. If you don't include 3DES, it will
    be automatically added at the end. Note that there are many factors
    that go into choosing an algorithm (for example, your key may not be
    the only recipient), and so the remote OpenPGP application being
    used to send to you may or may not follow your exact chosen order
    for a given message. It will, however, only choose an algorithm that
    is present on the preference list of every recipient key. See also
    the INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below.
the sending party will not have access to my gpg.conf file so that data
cannot affect his selection of a block cipher when encrypting traffic to
me.  i could change gpg.conf -- but right now i don't see that that
would do anything other than alter the default setting for preference --
possibly the output of --version
