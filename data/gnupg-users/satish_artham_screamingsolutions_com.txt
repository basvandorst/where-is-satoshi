@_subject: encrypting options 
I've got a rather simple question to which I have not found an answer on the
man page, FAQ, or handbook.
Is there any way to pass a public key in as a flag when encrypting (as
opposed to setting the -r flag).

1) When gpg is verifying a signed document, how does it know which public
key it should use to decrypt the signature?
2) Is there any way to output the signature as part of the document upon
decrypting a signed doc?

That's exactly what I want.  I'd like to receive an encrypted document via
HTTP, decrypt the document, and be able to verify that the signer of the
document is the same person that sent me the document.

Perhaps he is wanting the verification information included in the
original document once the signature has been verified... along the lines
of how Eudora and Outlook include it:
*** PGP Signature Status: good
*** Signer: Ingo KlÃ¶cker  (Invalid)
*** Signed: 05/03/01 10:01:37 AM
*** Verified: 05/03/01 11:39:47 AM
*** BEGIN PGP VERIFIED MESSAGE ***
