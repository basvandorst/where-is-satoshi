Hello Gordon Worley,
I believe having an actual signature present serves a better purpose if
you are looking to advertise the Product, not to mention the fact it
allows Users to verify your signature should they be so inclined. As for "useless bytes", they are not of course and add but a neglible
amount of bytes to one's posting.

@_subject: implications of subkeys? 
Hello Alex,
Alex, Frank and Dizss... That sounds simple enough, and thank you. I
think another aspect which is confusing to me is the term "Master
Signing Key", and then "signing subkey", which is, as I understand it,
something PGP doesn't offer. So, in an attempt to understand this,
myself and other people sign my UID(s), while my (owner) signature is
also attached to any subkey, be it signing or encryption, correct?
What is the purpose behind a signing subkey, and how does it differ from
the Master (Private) Key which I presume is also used for signing... or
are they one in the same? Can one change a signing subkey without it
affecting the Master Key? Can others still verify your signature even if
you change your signing subkey without having to issue a new Public Key?

Hello Mark Brown,
I am having trouble with your logic on this topic. How does issuing a
Revocation Certificate and uploading that to the KeyServer, differ in
any way from deleting a UID and uploading to the KeyServer, or better
yet to have the ability to delete right on the KeyServer itself. With
distribution being the same either way, I think it's a cleaner process
to remove the UID completely, and although that isn't possible at
present, it surely is wanted.

The fact he uses Outlook, which by the way is a good PIM but lousy Mail

whatever is responsible for setting the headers, in that it does not
include a Reply-To header. This is the only List I belong to that doesn't
include that header.

Hello Todd,

Yes, I agree with you that the List address should be used as the Reply-To.
In a Mailing List such as GnuPG Users the majority of Members who Reply to
Postings will want that Reply sent to the List, and only on the odd
occasion will they want a copy sent to the Author.

Hello David T-G,
In Reference to your Posting on Wednesday, June 05 2002 at 01:54 PM PDT,
If you are in the "don't muck" camp, then the Reply-To header should
contain the List address. When you reply to a List Posting, why would you
expect the reply to go to the author... and not the List? As mentioned,
GnuPG Users is the 'only' List I know of that behaves the way you like. It
flies in the face of common sense.

@_date: 2002-06-06 01:18:02
@_author: Nick Andriash 
@_subject: Idea how to leave double-mails out? 
Well for one I noticed you didn't set that header, and I doubt "Most
folks" would. You reply to a List posting... you would expect the posting
to be sent to the List. What you suggest means that everyone else on this
List would have to set the M-F-T header, as opposed to the List
Administrator setting just one header.
Perhaps things are different in the Unix world, but the generally accepted
practice I see is that the List sets the Reply-To header to the List
address. I have already received 3 personal postings on this thread, so
you can add redundancy to the list of cons to keep the status quo. ;o)

@_subject: Question regards session key error 
Hello Matthew561,
Are you using a front-end at all with GnuPG? The reason I ask is that in
my experience... limited as it may be... an error message like that
related to the Session Key usually indicate that the message was
encrypted with an Algo that is not supported on the receiving machine's
copy of PGP.
I think GnuPG defaults to 3DES if a common Algo cannot be found (while
PGP will default to either CAST5 or 3DES depending on version), but
sometimes when using a front-end you can 'force' GnuPG to use an
Algorithm regardless of the preferences found on the Public Key to which
you are encrypting. That may even be possible without using a front-end
by the option --cipher-algo .
