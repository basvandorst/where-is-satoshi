I would like to know if there is a way to add multiple signatures for a file
(in a separate file) and check who signed with just one command (so not by
signing a signed file...).

Ok, Thanks David,
But what if the file is signed by people working on different computers?
So they will had their signature on the current separate file
(correesponding to the people who already signed a specific file).
