If you just want to avoid typing the passphrase N times, i suggest to
use gpg-agent, which is the greatest invention since syrup on

@_subject: Difference between setpref and options in the configuration 
When reading
, which
advises to use gpg --edit-key and setpref to choose "better"
algorithms, I told myself "Why risking forgetting the right
command-line when you can simply use the configuration file?" So, I
put this in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf :
# SHA1 by default
cert-digest-algo SHA256
# Crypto preferences
personal-cipher-preferences  AES256 AES192 AES128 personal-digest-preferences SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224
personal-compress-preferences  ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
And generated a key, with two UID. But it seems the preferences in
personal-*-preferences have been completely ignored:
gpg> showpref

Per Tunedal  wrote  a message of 17 lines which said:
Isn't three different cases? For the fingerprint, it is in the RFC
4880 (section 12.2) and GnuPG cannot change it unilaterally or it
would stop to be OpenPGP-compliant.
For the signatures of public keys from others, you can already put:
cert-digest-algo SHA256
in your gpg.conf.
I don't know why it's not the default but there is certainly a good
reason in the archives mentioned by Peter Lebbing. In the mean time,
you can always migrate yourself.

You DNS resolver has probably a problem.
