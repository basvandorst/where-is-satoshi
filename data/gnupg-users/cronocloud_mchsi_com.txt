I think  you have to use:
gpg --edit-key
and then use:
keyserver full_URI_of_keyserver, for example: hkp://subkeys.pgp.net or in
your case: hkp://minsky.surfnet.nl
to remove the keyserver you would enter:

@_subject: beginner to gnupg 
I'm new to gpg too, just started using it in April.
If I want to export my public key to a file using the Linux
command line tools, I would do this:
 gpg --armor --export CronoCloud at mchsi.com >
CronoCloud_public_pgp_key.asc Have you tried out GPA (Gnu Privacy Assistant)? For new users
that might be easier to use and it's included in the GPG4Win
builds. Using that, just select your key, hit export, choose a
name for your exported key and you're done.
Sure, or you can add UID's to a key.

The sample checks out fine for me: "Good signature from Thawte
Freemail Member", using Claws-Mail with gpgme/gpgsm S/MIME
plugin. Can you verify my S/MIME signature?

If you're going to use PGP/Inline make certain that your mail
client uses BASE64 encoding for such messages.  That will ensure
that the MTA doesn't mess up message, preventing verification.
