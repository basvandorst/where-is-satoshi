@_subject: key-keyserver problem? 
Hash: SHA1
    Hello, seems hkp servers don't like my key, but ldap (at least
pgp.surfnet.nl) do. The web based servers have either mangled my
current key, not representing the keyid properly, or just plain
reject it now. Interestingly enough, even on surfnet, if one checks
it for my key by ldap, it will give it, but by web, just gives an
older, revoked key of mine, and denies the current one. When I try
sending it to the web based servers through the websites, I get some
sort of error about it being corrupted or something, even though gpg
itself is perfectly happy about it. Is there a prob with my key, with
gpg, am I doing something wrong, or is there a keyserver bug causing
this? (or none of the above. :)

)This looks like the key (fetched from ldap://pgp.surfnet.nl:11370)
I'm using a signing subkey, so I guess it's just reporting the
specific subkey.

denying the existance of it unless I try to submit it. It was
mangling the keyid before I did some updates though.
Where can I find a current list of working ldap based keyservers,

@_subject: with-colons listing, issue with distinguishing between encrypting and signing keys. 
Hash: SHA1
When I do the -with--colons listing of my key, it lists both my
subkeys as es, even though one is just an encrypting subkey and the
other is just a signing one.
I don't think it is a case of gpg not knowing the difference or the
key being corrupted or such, since I test it by trying to get it to
encrypt to the one that's suppused to be the signing key and vice
versa, and it always instead encrypts to the encrypting key and signs
with the signing key instead. I commented out the default key and so
on options in my .conf file during the tests to make sure that wasn't
it, and it still gets it right. So, gpg "knows" which key is which
kind, just doesn't seem to display it properly. Is this a bug, or
could I merely be misreading the listing?

I take that back, rechecked that, it's using only one of the subkeys for
both encrypting and signing, refusing to use the one that is meant to be a
signing key. This seems to be a recent problem. How would this happen, and
is it possible to fix it?

Clarification: One of the subkeys was created as sign only, the other as
encrypt only. Now they are listed as both being both signing and encrypting.

Ah, okie. Is there any way to repair the key, or should I just revoke the
whole thing and generate new ones?

*checks* oh, yay! Had thought I saw that the main key was mucked up, but
that's still good.

@_subject: [newbie] Revoking vs deleting public keys 
Hash: SHA1
does revoking a key do, exactly? Thanks.
Deleting a key from your keyring merely removes it from your files.
Revoking it is effectively constructing a signed message saying "this
key is revoked. don't bother trusting it anymore."
Think of the revoke command as the key's self-destruct button. :)

@_subject: adding recipients after the fact. 
Hash: SHA1
Let's say I encrypt a message/file to someone (or a group of them.)
Then later I decide that I want, in addition to the others, person x
to be able to read the message. is it possible for gpg (assuming that
I encrypted to myself as well, so that my compy still has access to
the session key) to add on recipent x, that is, add on the
appropriate header/whatever so that the same session key is encrypted
to recipent x as well? (I want to end up with a single file that is
readable by all the recipients) or would gpg just have to start from
scratch and pick a new session key and reencrypt to everyone,
including recipient x.)
ie, assuming message.asc is encrypted to myself as well as others, is
there a gpg command that would do something like "gpg --add-recipient
x to message.asc" or somesuch?

@_subject: Privacy Implications Of Signing Keys 
Hash: SHA1
Not to mention that anyone can sign keys, independant of the will of the
key's owner. (I think a protocol to actually remove unwanted sigs from a
key may be useful. (ie, a way to have the removal propagated by the
keyservers)) For instance, a friend of mine apperently signed my key
with a couple nonsense keys he generated just to emphasize the point.
