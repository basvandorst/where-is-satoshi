@_subject: can't import key through stdin 
My problem: gpg is unable to import keys from stdin:
~$cat test.txt | gpg --import
gpg: Total number processed: 0
It works fine when given a filename:
~$gpg --import test.txt gpg: key 88C1BFB7: public key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
but since this script will be used in a CGI environment,
I really rather not have to write a temp file.
Anyone run into this, or hopefully run into it and solve it?
Thanks in advance:
