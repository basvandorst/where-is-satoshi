In theory, any encrypted message is like completely random.
Brute force... trying every possible key on a message until the
decrypted message makes sense. Since in theory the corrupted message
could be the result of encrypting the message with a different key,
brute force may yield a different key, but in theory, this added
encryption does not add any security.
Now, is brute force feasible, no, not against any of the strong

This way, there is no reason for outlook to mess with the message after
signing, and it is possible for non-outlook clients to correctly verify
the signature...

@_subject: building gnupg-1.9.20 on macos 
Well, everything seems to work as expected but:
1- I had to build a wrapper script for gpg for use in enigmail to source
the .gpg-agent-env file I had the agent write. For some reason, on Linux
enigmail/thunderbird strips the required variables from gpg's
environment, of course on MacOS those vars were never there. This is
minor compared to the next thing. Still, not being able to statically
configure the socket for gpg-agent is a nuisance.
2- pinentry. When I start the gpg-agent in a Terminal (from
.bashrc/.bash_profile) I usually get a pinentry-cucrus prompt in that
window, but not when enigmail starts gpg. Since there is no native gui
pinentry (yet?) I'd love to be able to force gpg-agent to _allways_ use
one tty for pinentry, no matter what.
For now I've decided that the second issue is a 'show stopper' for
implementing gpg-agent based login auth with MacOS. I have to choose
between gpg-agent and decrypting/signing e-mail, and mail functionality won.
So I guess the next thing on the list for me is finding some way around
the second issue.
ps. I've not tested gpgsm in any way on MacOS. I see it's there, I just
haven't done anything with it (nor will I do so any time soon).

Hi all,
well, I've been using gpg-agent (gpg v 1.9.20) on both macos and linux for
some time now withj my openpgp smartcard.
Everything seems to be fairly stable, though I one did experience a crash of
gpg-agent on linux.
I do have some questions:
the GPG_AGENT_INFO envirunment variable contains a process id. I use gpg-agent
with a default-socket location. After the crash and subsequent restart
everything continued to work, is the pid part of the GPG_INFO var ignored? And
in that case, could I just set it to an arbitrary value in the wrapper-script
I build for enigmail? (not that I really care). Will that part be removed in a
future relase?
Though I have some cache-ttl set for both gpg as ssh use, this doesn't seem to
work for use with a openpgp smartcard. Collegues do tell me that caching does
work with on disk keys. Is this some misfeature/bug or just work in progress?
Does anybody have a build of gnupg 1.9.20 for windows(XP) ? I'd like to test
gpg-agent with putty. I do have a windows workstation available at work, but
no build environment...

_but_ gpg-agent also provides ssh-agent functionality for authentication
purposes. This is the _only_ part I'm currently intrested in from gpg
v2. Unfortunately, this means I'll have to stick to an ancient beta on
windows (yes, my boss makes me use this OS).
And here we disagree... for me, basically forced to use this windows
thing as an X-terminal, gpg-agent does add a bit of functionality.

@_subject: how to create a symmetric cipher 
basically, a key is a asymmetric cypher used to protect the 'passprase'
used in a symmetric cypher. So you can use the 'raw' symmetric cypher
(and think up the password yourself), or let gpg generate some random
bits as a password and encrypt the password using a public key. It's
either one of those two. I know of no alternatives, I don't believe any
alternatives are invented (but I might be wrong).
So if you don't fee symmetric cyphers to be strong enough, you have a
problem, because every pgp message is encrypted using one. Even when
using keys you'll need a passphrase, and as long as you protect it
carefully, you'll be ok either way.

have noted, gpg-agent does not cache pinentries for ssh authentication,
which basically means that you'll have to enter your pin every time you
connect to a remote host. Not to long ago Werner responded that he would
think about a change in gpg-agent to facilitate this. Now I was

WHY??? The whole purpose of encrypting a file is to add a barrier, a layer of
authentication, before it can be read. Now, I guess you could potentially
create a 'no security'-key... one not protected by a passphrase, but you might
as well not encrypt at all.

but the intended recepients read it (encrypted). Now as how openpgp
accomplishes this is not my problem, I don't want to know anything about
it. Version and Comment fiellds are not part of the message, so I should
not see them...

Now, this is true for you and me. Now, take my secretary as an example.
She has not installed any pgp/gpg aware software, nor is she an
experienced user of cryptographic tools. Do you expect her to correctly
interpret these hints? I don't. Now, usually I don't sign messages to
people who can't do anything with those signatures to prevent confusion.
So now it's blame somebody else? I guess that comments might not be the
best idea for the rfc/protocol. Do they serve any purpose in the
protocol? No? So maybe they are a problem in the protocol after al.
IMNSHO, the comments taint the very purpose of the digital signature.
Now as to this being the right mailinglist, this list is for discussions
amongst users of gnupg for discussions about the problems they see in
the use of gnupg. Yes in an ideal world all MUAs allways hide all gnupg
internals for all users all of the time. I guess you are now
volunteering to start convincing the people in Redmont? In the mean
time, maybe it's easier to think about what the protocol is intended to
do and conclude that maybe a comment field is not very useful, and could
be counterproductive.
(ps, if I want something to be part of a message, I can put it in the
signed part of the message just as well... eg. my sig.)

there is a hash calculated over the message, the longer the message, the
longer it takes to calculate the hash (given a particular hash algorithm).
Then the hash is encrypted using your secret key (in RSA), the longer
your key, the longer this step takes (again given a particular hash alg.).
So, a longer key has relatively little impact on the total time, esp.
when signing long messages. (any yes we do this because public/private
key crypto is quite cpu intensive).
Also, because of this, there is a session key generated for each
message, and that key is encrypted using recipients public key when
encrypting a message. So in order to achieve good message security, you
need both a strong rsa key and a strong session key.

That is because in the smtp protocol, a period on a line by itself

end a sentence with the period directly after the last word in most

most cases.
(so if you want a period on a line by itself, append a space, nobody
will see, but it won't be the end of your message either).
