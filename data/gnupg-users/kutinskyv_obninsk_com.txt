@_subject: zlib inflate problem 
I am decrypting files sent to me by another user through my HTTP server.
Quite often I get errors that look like the following snippet:
   "gpg: fatal: zlib inflate problem: oversubscribed dynamic bit lengths
   secmem usage: 2368/3808 bytes in 4/9 blocks of pool 3904/32768"
Could you please tell me what might cause this problem?
I am using GnuPG 1.4.1 on a Win2000.
File encryption/decription is performed in a batch mode.
For encryption:
   gpg --openpgp --output OutFile --recipient
Recipient --armor --yes --batch --encrypt InFile
For decryption:
   gpg --openpgp --output OutFile --yes --batch --passphrase-fd 0 --decrypt

Does anyone know what it means?
"gpg: CRC error; 92501E - 300D6B
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=2b)"
