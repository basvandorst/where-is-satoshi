@_subject: gpg output to a filename ending with .pgp 
I have been googling for an answer on how to have gpg encrypt a file to a file with a pgp extension.  It looks like maybe the only way is via a output redirect (> ?). I'm trying this via a command line on a windows box.  Here is my initial command in a batch file:
c:\gnupg\gpg -e -r tester --yes %1
I think I tried to use a --output or a -o switch but neither seemed to work.
Has anyone tried this before? Could you paste your command here? Please cc me since i'm not on the mailing list yet.
Thanks very much!
