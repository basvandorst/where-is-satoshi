Hi, I have compiled gnupg for Darwin on two dual-processor, gigabit
G4 computers, and it appears to be working fine.  I'm excited about the
possibility of trying the MPI implementation.  If there is a quick
tutorial for gnupg with MPI, or if someone could send me an example,
that would be great.
Be sure to CC, and I'm new to encryption.  I'm signing this message
with the new gnupgp build.
