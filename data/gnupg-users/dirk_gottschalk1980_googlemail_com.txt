- Full CA functionality in GPGsm, incl. CRLs and extended attributes
  for signed certificates
- A free cup of coffee, every time GPG tells a function may take a
  while
- A Medal of honor after 1.000 signatures.
- And, last, but not least, a complete manual.
Okay, only the first and the last ones are realistic. But, don't take

Just to make things clear. The user information, UID and so on, is in

card-status reads the information oin the card and maps the key to the
public part using the Fingerprint, I think.
In my case, when I use one of my cards, where the fetch URL is not set,
I download the keys from the keyserver with "--recv-keys" and then I
read the card with "--card-status". But in general, I prefer the way
using the fetch URL. It's faster to make "--card-edit" and just use
fetch. This comines both funcrions.

I even don't think there is any good reason for the EU-Regulation at

The trust level for a key depends on the trust to the signature which
are made for your key. There is no valid reason to trust "Governikus"
or "D-Trust (Bundesdruckerei)" by default at all, especially for people
in foreign countries. Even I don't do this.
Best thing is to verify a key personally.
I would create a file which describes how your key was verified before
signing and the data FPR and UID of your gnupg key, sign this with your
x.509 and create a detached signature with gnupg. Needles to say that
you should use the key mentioned in the PDF.
The wording should not be difficult itself. Something like:
The OpenPGP key
is signed by Governikus.....
 ... signed by ...

The Problem is the implication of trust in governmental organizations

providers who are trusted per default. AFAIK, Governikus is not listed

Okay, that's yout thing. BUT, you may habe verified some of the signers
keys at your own, this would be the same as checking against Governikus
,for example.
This is also the case with the PGP standard.
Libreoffice can verify the signature also and some other tools.
This is the real problem I have with the EU regulations. There are
regulations out there which are much better and have not such expensive
certification costs to become "qualified".
I would consider a x.509 cert as valid and trustworthy which is signed
by one of the well known CAs whith "extended verification". But that's
another discussion.
This isn't the Problem at al?l. X.509 is a really good standard. I use
it mysqld really often for signing PDFs or some other things. That's what i meant.
Godd idea. I found some Policies regarding PGP, but nothing like you
want to do. But I only did a quick search.
Not the whole procedure. But you should explain that this ist a
trustworthy signature provider sind Governikus is not yet listed as a
standard root CA.
To state it clear. x.509 is a good standard and a good procedure. I
only think the "qualified" overrated in some situations. The
"qualified" is only really relevant in juristic context in Germany or
in EU. And even then there are some exclamations where other rules
override this. I had a lawsuit one year ago that showed this clearly.
The combination of OpenPGP-Card and x.509 is, that should be said,
really a goof thing. I'm running my a CA for my customers and me, for
internal purposes, which means for data exchange between different
software and so on, and the keys are derived from PGP keys on Card.
GPGSM is a really nice solutions for such CSRs.I t only lacks the
ability of creating CRLs, otherwise it could be used as a CA too.

Libreoffice is complaining about a bad signature with Zertificates from

they seem to be doing something that's not compliant to the standard.
Another Argument against using this cert, IMHO. All other certificates
work well in Libreoffice in my case. I don't have a D-Trust signed file
to check the problem. But I am interested in doing so, if I could get

PDFSign is another tool that could be tried.

I created a few policies in the past since my English is not bad. I'll

With differing signature levels you surely do let people know that kind

of relations between people/keys from their signatures, including the

Using just sig0 reduces the usability of the data because you can not

A compromised computer is not the real deal at all in this question.
You can sign sig0 without havin any trouble of this kind. That's the
reason why we have the trustdb since GnuPG 2.?. It depends on the
internal set trust and gpg computes the calculated trust level for the

I do use singanture levels as well, but I am thinking about this

implementation of an open source tool? Everybody can read the source,
if he wants. I believe they just use one of the crypto-libraries
available, like libcrypt, or libgcrypt, for example.
Except for the weeks, months, or years, which were needed to firstly
implement the JPeg format, for example and the other ten millions of
picture formats out there in the world. ;)
I see what you mean regarding to promotion and so on. But, under the
line, it's not worth the trouble. ^^

Sure, GPG can be "abused" in many ways. I also do this by using it for
a purpose it was not invented for. This is not an evil functionality.
If dome people like to put HiRes photos or other pictures in their UID,
for whatever purpose, so it is not an evil thing. Distributing a key

I think the 16M are from times, where RAM was nbot measured in GB. In

Regarding to this, the Parameter is applied to avoid reading  larger
Packets than 16M for importing and so on, on the client side. So, if a
'bad guy' alters his version of GPG in a way to create such abusive
keys, the other users with an unaltered version should not get into
trouble with such a key.
Okay, it's quite possible to set this read limit down to, let's say,
8M, but I think 16M is a good limit to avoid hanging and other side
effects with a way to large key.

Validating the KEys and it's packet would mitigate many of the SKS

Okay, running an in house keyserver might be an option for this
Also the centralized Approach is a no go in my opinion.
Reading this thread, I feel like I've done a time travel, back to the
times where people distributed their keys over the usenet due to the
lack of keyserver dunctionality. Keyservers like the desribed one is
less than useless in my opinion.
Even removing the ability to search for keys by UID is a thing I don't
like. But that's the GDPR panic. Yes, I know, no politics from the
angry guy. ^^

That's right. As told, SKS is far away from perfect and your solution
goes the right way. Nothing prevents the implementation of, let's say
key signatures in further versions or different versions to be used in
environments on an in house server.
I didn't consider it until you mentioned ist. A good idea, thanks.
Isn't verifying the origination of an Email, including the address, one
of the PGP approaches? Theres simply one point: "If you do not want
your email to be public, don't upload your key to a server."
If I didn't want my address to be known by others, I shouldn't post to
an open ML. Same thing in my opinion.
In my opinion, the UID is essential for the Keys, except of M2M Usage.
Yes, the key servers (SKS) have come of age and some things weren't "on
the radar screen" of it's developers for various reasons.
No. But if I want to sent you an email and want to encrypt it on a
machine with an empty keystore, shouldn't I be able to fetch your key
by Address? It could be realized by exact match of the email address
instead of spitting everything out that comes near to the requested
Just my 2 cents and I am open to discuss benefits and downsides.

Additionally some kind of authentication mechanism would be required to

Yes, I agree.
This would not be poissible with an authentication mechanism. See
above. Only the owner should be able to modify his key or make
ammendements. Probably except for revocations, in somne cases.
M2M keys don't need a UID at all. I made such keys f?r my automatic
backups and for some of the telematics solutions I work on. We use them
only to encrypt, sign and send tachograph data files which are sent to
our customers by email, for example.
So you support key search, this is a good point. And it ind of changes
my opinion about the new servers. I didn't have the time to dig deeper
into this new server and my opinion is based upon the things I read on
the list. So this discussion is really helpful.
Just the point of a centralized server is a thing that is not good in
my opinion, but there should and will be a way to implement a
distributed system into this project. A synchronizatio?n mechanism has
to be well overthought, that's one point, but technically there are
some ways to implement a secure and stable mechanism to achieve
distribution. This is a point which should be considered.

As one of the lawyers I work for told me, the consent could be

that users can only upload their own keys, so consent is guaranteed.
The User knows how and why the data is processed, if he uploads his key
to the server. A deletion has to be possible by the regulation, SKS
lacks this mechanism. I haven't tested the new server yet, but I'm
planning to do this in the next day. As far as I read, deletion is
possible there.
Yes and no. The EU construct is a little bit strange in this manner,

The reason for my suggestion. I'm working at a company which creates

companies. We use NFC tags for a drivers license check. These are
stickers on the drivers license card to check if it is available.
Removing them from the card destroys them. We now had multiple times
the problem that those stickers were dead on arrival. We did a fw tests
ans saw that the problem occurs only after the tags were on the postal
way. Perhaps some strong magnetic fields in the postal systems, or
anything like that.
Now as we send and receive those tags in boxes, we didn't have Problems
Cards never had this problem, as far as I can tell.
The Tags should have enough memory to take encrypted messages. I think
at least 12k. The more memory, the longer can the message be.
Another benefit of using plastic cards instead of sticker tags is: They
are reusable.
