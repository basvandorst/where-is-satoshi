Hi all,
A small question: my gpg.conf includes the following line:
keyserver-options keep-temp-files verbose no-include-revoked no-
unquote (all on 1 line),
as well as:
keyserver ldap://pgp.surfnet.nl:11370
but nevertheless if I do a:
gpg --recv-keys KEYID, the revoked keys of KEYID are still imported into my pubring.
Could someone explain why the revoked keys are included in the import anyway?

Sorry, no, that's not what I meant. I just want to cut the 'deadwood' of revoked and expired userID's and signatures from my current pubring and upon either --refresh-keys I wouldn't (again) receive revoked and expired data for the current keys in my ring and in case of --recv-keys I would get only current data, exclusive of revoked & expired IDs and signatures.

If it were an interactive-only option, that shouldn't be a problem:
the user should be able to decide to have valid data overwritten
during --refresh-keys by revoked or expired-earlier-than-foreseen
(see my earlier post in this respect). Subsequently the user can
then manually remove such data.
On the other hand I wouldn't have a problem not being able to
verify (old) mail just because the userID isn't around anymore. I
will assume that that mail was already verified upon receipt when
the data was still current. However, if I should run into a problem
I would still be able to update the key with the option commented
out in gpg.conf and get all revoked and expired data back again for
as long as needed.  I understood it well enough but perhaps I didn't address the point
clearly enough: I don't mind seeing the data (and would in fact
personally prefer them not to be hidden), but my personal aim in
this respect is to obtain a lean and mean pubring devoid of
unneeded data. I will manually delete revoked and expired data and
the option should filter them from reappearing.
In short, my preference would be: show what's there, delete myself
what I don't need and be able to set an option to have it not
appear again.  I appreciate your reactions.

Sorry, but I must disagree with you on this point. The sender the content to the receiver. You cannot then force the receiver to save the clear-text. You can only ask him, but if you force him to his system in a certain way that encroaches on his privacy.
Except when the receiver/employee/contractor needs to comply with
a sender/superior's directives, you cannot force him to use his
machine one way or the other.
Why couldn't the receiver, e.g. save the clear-text on a scramdisk?
Perhaps the receiver is reading his mail behind a firewall, offline
alone in a bunker? I would not want to use Mahogany as a recipient
if I were unable to turn the tempest-like viewer off or save the text to a place which IMO is safe.

about "Re: GPG support in Mahogany":
In my view these are almost synonymous, at least in this case. Anyway I agree on that point.
True, but he entrusts the contents of the message to the recipient,
otherwise he should not have sent the (encrypted) message to him.
So he also trusts the receiver to not repeat the contents by any
means from the tempest viewer (no matter how, e.g. by retyping
word for word). So he can only *ask* the recipient to uphold the
utmost security when viewing his e-mail. However IMHO he
should not *force* the recipient under all circumstances
(including those of the highest possible security) to view them
by means of one viewer or another.
It is naturally the responsibility of the recipient to observe the
highest possible security without infringing on that of the sender,
but the sender must trust the receiver to be the judge of his own
threat model, not the sender. If there is no such trust the sender
should not relay the sensitive data to the receiver at all.
Therefor, IMO, Mahogany should not *force* the recipient to use any
kind of tempest viewer. It may be turned on by default but I as
recipient must be able to turn it off if I judge that my
circumstances permit that - without breaking the trust the sender
placed in me.
You may, of course, disagree with me, but in that case I will not
use your application if it *forces* me to view the content of an
encrypted message in a manner that I prefer not to use. On the
other hand, as I said before, if you are in a position to *order*
me to do so then I can only observe the instruction. But that will
apply only if there is an agreed relation e.g. employer/employed,
contractor etcetera.
Okay, in such cases I would say turn the tempest viewer on by
default, but in a secure setting the receiver should have the
liberty/privacy/right to turn it off. That does not relieve him of
the need to not break the privacy, liberty or security of the
sender. But that should remain in the hands of the recipient. If
the sender does not trust the receiver to that extent, then don't
send the message.
I trust this clarifies my view and I hope that you can to any
extent agree with what I am saying.

Hash: SHA1
Hi all,
[ Don't you Linuxers start laughing, please: I am one of yours *) ] What could perhaps be interesting for the readers of this list is what happened to me tonight: on the command console I updated my preferences on an old RSA secret key (69DA67C9) imported early this year from PGP 7.0.3, and with F7 (bringing up previous commands) I did an update pref. with the same string I had previously done on an old PGP created DSA key (3E0047E8). When I did several F7's that way I noticed GPG wasn't responding well, but stupidly continued and setpref'ed. It worked okay I found later, but it BSOD'ed my W2KSP3. The fatal exception screen showed an error message I never saw before, but realising what I had been doing was explanatory: quote stop error 0xc000021a (Fatal System Error). The Windows Subsystem process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0xc0000005 (0x77fcb238 0x005bf940) unquote.  A remark in the "Getting Started" booklet provided with the W2K setup-CD from Microsoft under this stop error states i.a.: "the user subsystem, such as winlogon or the client server runtime subsystem (crss), is fatally compromised and security can no longer be guaranteed". If some of you W2K'ers would want to recreate this, pls bear in mind that my secring is on a PGP Disk, I was running hardly anything except BlackIce PC Protection and Kerio personal firewall. But we can't completely blame windows for this (yet another BSOD), because since day 1 that I own W2K my hardware setup appears to be not completely compatible with it, this was worsened when SP3 was published and sofar I couldn't obtain the perfect controller card driver for me and my W2K yet. So my box is much more likely to fall over than someone's completely stable system.
Nevertheless it is my experience that GnuPG is drawing so many resources (I have 458 Mb RAM and a PII /350 MHz that should normally speaking be sufficient) that since SP3 I have taken many a beating. I have even been falsely accusing GPGshell of some freezes I suffered, but it has become clear to me that GnuPG (both 1.2.1-1 and 1.3.0) is so demanding that a not 100% stable system will bowl over.   If there would be any chance of making available an option in GnuPG to make less demands on the O/S + hardware I would highly appreciate that. Of course, I don't want to bring down encryption speed for everybody, but I could imagine that others might suffer difficulties too, sometimes. Anyway I hope the information is helpful for those who want to see GnuPG usage increase in general: it's a fine tool for me in all other respects.

Hash: SHA1
Hi all,
With my mailer Sylpheed (v. 0.9.4) I can sign / encrypt etc. in 2 different
ways: `actions` (scripts) by which I can simply call GnuPG (or
any other programme) anyway I want, or one can choose the built-in functions
of sign / encrypt etc. which uses GnuPG via GPGME, since I configured my
Sylpheed with GPGME enabled.
Most of the time I used the actions, but lately I started using the built-in
functions. To my surprise, however, the GPGME library seems to ignore my
options as laid down in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf: e.g. when I use GPGME no comment
appears in my signature, which does happen otherwise. This message is such
an example.
I have tried finding a config file or documentation showing how for GPGME,
but I can`t seem to find a way to direct it to my options. If anyone could
tell me, I`d appreciate it.
I am using GPGME version 0.3.15. Later versions aren`t supported by Sylpheed

Update the Mandrake rpm* packages, which have been

Apparently the required key not only needs to be on the rpm keyring but also
has to be associated with the source it is supposed to verify. If I run `rpm -K foo.rpm` it checks okay, but if it is not associated in Software
Media Manager RpmDrake will not recognize the key verifying it.
Besides, I don`t have an /etc/RPM-KEYS, Mandrake 9.2 seems to put them
elsewhere. Below /var/lib/rpm if I am not mistaken.

This is not exactly the answer you asked for, but my suggestion is to set

Linux way. If you want to share your key ring I suggest you take your
keyring(s) with you via a FAT(32) partition during reboot time. In Linux
you can gpg (--interactive) --import myother_pubring.gpg and I am sure
this will work in Windows too. Secret keys too.
When I upgraded my Windows box at long last to a multiboot box running Linux (~99% of 24/7 hours) I took my keys with me and hardly use those

Hi all,
The separate discussion on keystorage in an SQL database made me think
of the possibility to add a bit of room for internal notes on every key in
the local public keyring (internal meaning not exportable) which
should be searchable via the existing gpg routines.
For example I might have a lot of people called John, Johnny, Johnson,
Johnsson  etc. on my pubring and typing =B4gpg --list-key john=B4 could turn
into an uncomfortably long list. But if I could add a note of =B4cousin=B4
in the notespace, it would, ideally, give only one entry for=20
=B4gpg --list-key cousin=B4. (Unless I had more noted cousins than *john* in
my pubring.
Another example: allow a note like =A8gnupg-users tennis previous-job=A8.
So it could, IMHO, be a nice tool to search keys much more
efficiently if a little maintenance is done by the interested user.
Thanks for your consideration.

IIRC (it`s been a while since I wrote winscripts) a batfile with following

gpg -ea -r UID file.txt && del file.txt

gpg -ea -r UID file.txt && echo y | del file.txt
YMMV according to the version of command.com / cmd.exe

It is very sad to hear this. A long time ago we exchanged a dozen or two
e-mails that were quite personal. I appreciated her great courage and
