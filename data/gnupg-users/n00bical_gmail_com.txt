@_subject: make data available for a certain amount of time 
Hello list,
I want to know if it is possible with gpg to offer data for a certain amount
of time.
I want to do the following :
I create a website and pack it in a zip file
when a complete stranger opens the website in the zip it checks for a valid
key on a keyserver.
when they key is valid the site opens
when the key is invalid the website never opens and the contentfiles of the
website in the zipfile cannot be accessed in any way
thanks in advance for your replies

Hello Faramir and Robert,
thank you for the responses.
I want everyone to be able to acces the data as long as the data is valid.
When the data becomes invalid i want it to be inaccesible for everyone.
I want to control and force when the data should be invalid, i was thinking
of using the expiration of a gpg key.
Any suggestions are appreciated.
