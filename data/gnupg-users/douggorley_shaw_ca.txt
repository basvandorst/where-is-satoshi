@_subject: Problem with tar ball 
Check the md5sum of the tarball you downloaded with the command:
  md5sum gnupg-1.2.2.tar.gz
As stated on the "Integrity Check" page at gnupg.org, the md5sum for that file is  4e1b357b22e1d45d14d340ce03d39b63.  If you get something different, you've got a corrupted tarball; try again.
