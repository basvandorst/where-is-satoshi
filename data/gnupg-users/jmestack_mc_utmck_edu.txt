@_subject: Encrypting with a venders public key 
Hello, I am new to gpg, and have a July 1 deadline.  We have just installed
it on an HPUX machine.
I have downloaded one of our vendors public key's and --import fine.
But when I attempt to encrypt a file using their key, I get the following
gpg -r securekey --always-trust -o 20020627.gpg -e 20020627.opt
gpg: fatal: can't connect to `/home/meuser/.gnupg/entropy': No such file or
secmem usage: 2400/2400 bytes in 5/5 blocks of pool 2400/16384
Can someone please help identify what this means and what I need to do to
get it functioning.

@_subject: newbee entropy question 
I set up a separate user to encrypt data files using a different public key
and I get the following error:
gpg: fatal: can't connect to `/home/newuser/.gnupg/entropy': No such file or
I've tried copying the entropy file over to the new users .gnupg directory
and get the following error:
cp: /home/olduser/.gnupg/entropy: Operation not supported on socket
Is there only one instance of this file allowed on the server?
Any help would be appreciated.
