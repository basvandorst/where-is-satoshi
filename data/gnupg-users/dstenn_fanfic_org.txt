@_subject: Problems with the gnupg 1.0.1 and FreeBSD 3.3 
I have 2 systems and in both case I'm getting stuck generating key pairs.  I have exhausted my possibilities on  as well as other gnupg
pages.  I've also emailed the FreeBSD gnupg ports maintainer and asked
this same question.  The two accounts I have are dstenn and
dtenn  I really hope you can help.
I have successfully compiled and installed gnupg 1.0.1 but when I run
 gpg --gen-key
and answer all the questions I get stuck.  Here is the out put so far..

DSA keypair will have 1024 bits.
About to generate a new ELG-E keypair.
minimum keysize is  768 bits
default keysize is 1024 bits
highest suggested keysize is 2048 bits
Requested keysize is 1024 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
        = key expires in n days
      w = key expires in n weeks
      m = key expires in n months
      y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 2y
Key expires at Fri Apr 12 14:32:28 2002 JST
Is this correct (y/n)? y
You need a User-ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user
from Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
    "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) "
Real name: Dennis Tenn
Email address: dtenn
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Dennis Tenn "
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
Not enough random bytes available.  Please do some other work to give
the OS a chance to collect more entropy! (Need 18 more bytes)

Well..  To tell you the truth..  I ran a 'make buildworld' and concurrent
'find / &' and as an update to the problem..  It did finally complete but
it took many hours on my P266.  This doesn't seem right to me.

Thank you Jos.
This was it exactly.  I checked vmstat and used irqs that would provide me
with activity.  As expected, the gpg key generation process flew by and I
was left with a key pair in less than a minute.  This should be included
in the FAQ IMHO.
Thank you to all.  I'm happily exchanging encrypted email now.

'man gpg'
You would've found the option '--homedir'
       --homedir directory
                 Set  the name of the home directory to directory
                 If this  option  is  not  used  it  defaults  to
                 "~/.gnupg".  It  does not make sense to use this
                 in a options file. This also overrides the envi-
                 ronment variable "GNUPGHOME".
Set the environment variable and make sure you have the floppy mounted.
