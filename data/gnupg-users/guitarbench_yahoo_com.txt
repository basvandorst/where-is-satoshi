@_subject: UbuntuLinux GPG Still Doesn't Work With Remailers 
I've been trying now for almost three months and I
still can't get the Cypherpunks remailers to accept
messages encrypted with Ubuntu Linux/GPG v1.2.5.  I have no idea what's wrong.  I've tried everything I
can think of and it STILL refuses to work.  I used
Windows XP PGP and the remailers every day for YEARS
and never had a problem with PGP, but I can't get
Linux/GPG to work with the remailers to save my life.
Cutting & Pasting encryption doesn't produce a message
that remailers can recognize.
Making the remailer message and directives into a text
file, encrypting it with command-line GPG then adding
the header
  ::
  Encrypted: PGP
and a space wont work.  Nothing works.
Any ideas?

I use the -eat command line, which should cover it, but it doesn't seem to.
I'm wondering if there's some screwup with the

Having its linefeeds grunged.  On the other hand, I
can send an unencrypted remailer message (to the remailers that accept them) with the directives in
plaintext and it works.  That's what I'm doing now.
Mysteriously, as I've mentioned before, Dizum accepts my encrypted messages.
ONLY Dizum.
remailers that have them.
That's certainly what I always thought, plus I was under the impression that it wouldn't matter with RSA recipients who weren't using the IDEA algorithm.
I have the IDEA file, but I cannot figure out what to
do with it, as the instructions assume a level of Linux experience I do not  yet have.  In any case, it
doesn't seem essential to using remailers with DSS

Apparently not.  I have used the --pgp2 switch with no
resulting success. The remailers have used all
versions of PGP in Windows with no decryption problems
whatsoever for years in some cases.
If I can figure out how to install IDEA, I will, but I
can't see how it could possibly matter with DSS/DSA
The original respondent was correct.  I can say with
absolute, 100% certainty that this is not the case.
Despite -at armoring, I have seen the GPGed armored
messages arrive with "|"s at the end of each line,
etc.  There are definitely line ending compatibility
problems in some cases, worst with Yahoo mail, though
these support Windows/PGP flawlessly.
The "cipher dir" in this case would be
My personal guess at this point is that this has
something to do with charactersets, though nominally
UTF-8 should work.  The ONLY way I could get GPG to
work (sometimes) in Enigmail for simple encrypted
e-mail only, however, was to change the characterset
to ISO-8859-1.  Linux/GPG has for the most part been
an unremitting nightmare to use, and I have been using
PGP daily since I beta-tested v.1 for Phil Zimmerman
back in the late Bronze Age.
I am NOT trying to use Enigmail with remailers.  For
this I have used the kGPG shell or stright comman-line
GPG encryption, with no difference in success.  The
messages as sent look 100% perfect...they just don't
I have repeatedly asked over the past several months
on alt.privacy.anon-server and alt.security.pgp for
help from people using Linux/GPG with remailers
without success.  I have no access to the remops list,
though this would probably give the most useful info. This may just be yet another example of Linux Hell,
one of the seemingly infinite number of undocumented,
utter application failures that make that OS such a
trial to use. [sigh!]

So...if the remailers are distributing DSS kets, what
version of PGP can we assume they are using?
What GPG encryption options can we use to work with that version of PGP?
Thanks for any help on this.

This is apparently not relevant to my question, as the
remailers are using DSA/DSS keys (see previous
Changing to PGP6 compatibility also makes no
difference for what that's worth.
Let's stick to my original problem until we get it

That's what I thought.  Enabling PGP6 compatibility in
kGPG does not make any difference, though.
--rfc1991 doesn't work.  That (as I understand it)
simulates PGP 2.*, which these remailers aren't using
as they have DSA/DSS keys.
I don't understand what you mean.
Apparently not.  I'd like to have access to the REMOPS
list, but it's invitation-only
Discussing this on alt.privacy.anon-server has been a
bust, though most remailer operators frequent that
Curiously, I've never been able to find a Linux user
who has worked with the remailers, though some of them
are running Linux!

I spent several hours testing that command line and
every permutation I could think of without having GPG
accept it once.
In any case, it doesn't account for any default
settings in echolot's configuration.
