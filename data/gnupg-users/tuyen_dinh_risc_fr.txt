@_subject: validating other keys on your public keyring 
According to "The GNU Privacy Handbook" :
« a correspondent's key is validated by personally checking his key's
fingerprint »  (
 * is it equivalent or less secure to personally check the person's
   keyid ?
 * and why do most of people send their fingerprint in their message,
   since the fingerprint is the thing you want to check personally ?

When you want to sign a key you have just imported, in which cases will
you choose one the following choices :
   (0) I will not answer. (default) ?
   (1) I have not checked at all.   ?

I wondered : if I have no idea about the key's authenticity, is it worth
it to sign it ? (except sign it locally)

What is the interest for others to know that I couldn't check its
authenticity ?
Or maybe this is just an information for myself ?
