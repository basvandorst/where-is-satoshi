Yes, it seems to. I altered a nested set two deep in g10/gpgv.c and it
gave no errors and the object and executable were the same size, so I
guess they are equivalent.
Editing to that format however is just a difficult, but I guess it is
more readable.
Cheers, Brian.

@_subject: compiling gnupg-1.0.3 on our AIX 4.2.1 
First, I suggest you upgrade to version 1.0.4. I gather 1.0.3 has a bug
in it.
Second, I got it to compile under AIX 3.2.5. I doubt there is something
iun the older version that is no longer there.
Third, what compiler did you use? I suggest you use the AIX C cc
compiler. I had some problems with gcc although it compiled.
Cheers, Brian.
