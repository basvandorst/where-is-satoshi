I ask about this a long time back, but due to an upgrade lost my reply.
How do I export my secret keys in a useable fashion?
When I gpg --export-secret-keys, I get a screen full of symbols, which I
assume are encrypted  secret keys. Normally I would cheat and use windoze
for key admin. The time has come for this to stop, and exporting secret
keys is the only remaining difficulty I have in my key management.

Works perfectly. I have been involved in setting a local LUG, and have
always made a point of signing my messages with GnuPG. People started to
notice, and became interested......reculting in me having to give a
presentation on Encryption,  and also run a keysigning party.  That was the
kick up the backside to make me find out a little more rather than use
Windoze PGP as an easy way out.

@_subject: Generating a key with non default cipher. 
Hash: SHA1
I am still playing around with commandlines rather than my usual GUI.
 I have been trying to generate a key with a non default cipher, but with
little success.
I was trying to generate  a new DSA/ElGamal key using 3DES as the cipher.
First I tried cipher-algo 3DES in my options file, with no success.
I then tried
gpg --gen-key --cipher-algo 3DES
In both cases, when I imported the key into PGP 6.0.2, the properties
identified the cipher to be IDEA. I have been lead to believe that this
is the inability of PGP to correctly identify a non standard cipher. AS
3DES is standard in PGP, I suspect that it may be Blowfish.
I would apppreciate some direction as to where I am going wrong.

I recently decided to generate a DH/DSS sign only key. I imported the public
key into my windows system, and was surprised to see that the cipher used
was Idea.
If Idea is not considered to be a standard cipher in GnuPG.....why was it
used as a default cipher in this generation?
I did not use any command lines....the key was generated using key
management in Geheimnis.

Hi folks
The subject is fairly self explainatory. I like to have PGP
capabilities on the windows system I *have* to use at work.
I recently installed the official windows version of GnuPG and
the latest version of GnuPG Shell. Test messages to myself were
displayed perfectly on both Pegasus and Eudora. However when I finally
downloaded them to my Linux box at home....all the line breaks were
shown by ^M. If I decided to reply to myself the Linux editor
automatically removed these. I have also noticed the same thing when receiving messages from other Windows GnuPG users, and it does
not seem to be specific to a particular mailer.
I would value feed back from anyone who has had the same problem.
I have 3 variables:
Is it GnuPG?
Is it GnuPG Shell?
Is it Mutt?

All messages I receive from windows mailers are displayed correctly.
All messages I receive from Windows mailers and  signed by GnuPG are displayed correctly.
All messages I receive from Windows clients, and encrypted by GnuPG
display the ^M at the end of each line.
Ok I can convert them to Unix text files using extra software.
...but why does there have to be a difference?
PGP messages from windows display OK. Is there a work-around?
