Hash: SHA256
Dear community,
for my bachelor thesis I need a java library which supports basic
OpenPGP functions. I need the library for encrypting mails, signing
keys and recieving and uploading keys from/to a keyserver over the hkp
I have already found Bouncy Castle and OpenPGP Library for Java from
DidiSoft.com (uses on the lower level Bouncy Castle OpenPGP
Are there still other java librarys? Which of the librarys is the best
I would prefer a non-commercial library.
Thank you for your help and kind regards
