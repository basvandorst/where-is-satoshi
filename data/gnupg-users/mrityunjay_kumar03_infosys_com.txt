@_subject: GNUPG Issues.  
Hi Team,
On my application server GPG 1.2.1 is being used. Recently the keys expired on the server. We had to extend the expiry key which we did to 4 years. As the interfacing server also uses the same keys but different expiry dates, hence we only changed the expiry keys.
Even after changing expiry key and setting the trust to ultimate we are having following error.
gpg: : skipped: unusable public key
gpg: : sign+encrypt failed: unusable public key
Could anyone please help.
Server version being used is Solaris 8.
