Hi there im having problems trying to decrypt a message using PHP or
Perl. When i run the perl script directly from the linux bash it works
just fine, but when i run the script from the browser it doesnt work.
Checkin the apache logs it says:
Name "main::passphrase" used only once: possible typo at
gpg: fatal: ~/.gnupg: can't create directory: No such file or directory
I create the keys using root as user. I got the .gnupg directory on
local repository. I dont know what im doing wrong.
My gpg version is 1.4.1
Any help would be useful.
Thanks a lot.

Hi guys thanks a lot for your answers i solve the problem already,
actually all of you were right, i was running Apache as www user, so i
configure the script permisions enabling  read, write and execution
for www.
Additionally on my script, i put the output path of the decrypt file
on a directory that www has write and read permisions and all works
just fine.
Thanks a lot to all of you.
