@_subject: gpg barfing on system on which i don't use it 
upon reinstatement of my new key, all is well on my own computer.
however, when i try to read gpg-signed messages on a server where i'm
not storing my key, i get the following output (about 6 or 10k worth
of it):
gpg: Signature made Sun Feb 16 18:49:49 2003 EST using DSA key ID 0D4D97EB
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=00)
gpg: read_keyblock: read error: invalid packet
gpg: enum_keyblocks failed: invalid keyring
gpg: requesting key 0D4D97EB from wwwkeys.us.pgp.net ...
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=00)
gpg: read_keyblock: read error: invalid packet
gpg: enum_keyblocks failed: invalid keyring
gpg: key 0D4D97EB: public key imported  gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=00)
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=00)
the last two lines are repeated FOREVER.
what is this output about?  and how can i get rid of it?
