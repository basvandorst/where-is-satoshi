Does anyone know of a Perl wrapper for
GPG or should I post it to CPAN when
I've written it....?
Thanks in anticipation,

It would be a module, but rather than a reinterpretation of the
OpenPGP RFC or some other Crypt routine, or the PGP module that
makes a system call to PGP, I need a Perl interface to
the C en-/decrypt routines.  It is, I figure, a speed thing,
as the wrapper will map Perl vars to the C data types, and Perl
subs to C functions.
I've not seen it done yet, at CPAN or elsewhere, but it seems such an obvious thing that I reckon I must have overlooked it.
