@_subject: Kmail 
Does someone of you have configured Kmail, with GNUPG? I have install it, I could send encrypted e-mails, but I cannot decrypt the e-mails, but it always tell me that I dont have their public key. What I'm doing wrong?
I have exported all the keys with this option  gnupg --import-keys keys.asc
and the private key with gnupg --allow-import-secret-key
Please help me out with this.
