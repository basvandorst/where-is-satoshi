Hello David,
Yes, e. g.
gpg --set-policy-url  --sign key-id
setting this with gpg --gen-key, your new generated key has the policy
Mmmh, i think you must first del your sig and make a new one (?)
set-policy-url - a point for the --edit-key menu? ;) Also when signing a key or you can add this to your gpg.conf, than
everytime signing a key, the same notation is added.

Hello David,
from the man page for 1.2.1:
"Put the name value pair into the signature as notation data. name must
consist only of alphanumeric characters, digits or the underscore; the
first character must not be a digit."
OK, no problem, but i hope, the man page will be updated too.

Hello David,
Have read this in Names in the user name space consist of a UTF-8 string tag followed
by " followed by a DNS domain name. Note that the tag MUST NOT
contain an " character. For example, the "sample" tag used by
Example Corporation could be "sample
Names in a user space are owned and controlled by the owners of that
domain. Obviously, it's of bad form to create a new name in a DNS
space that you don't own.
Since the user name space is in the form of an email address,
implementers MAY wish to arrange for that address to reach a person
who can be consulted about the use of the named tag.  Note that due
to UTF-8 encoding, not all valid user space name tags are valid
email addresses. for my understanding: the name syntax has something to do with
the UTF-8 encoding or name resolution? Don't understand this
section very well.
And what would you say is the best or general form of the 'name' part of
the notation string for a private user? The e-mail address of the
person, who is the holder or creator of the notation or in conjunction
with a sig or cert policy, the holder/creator of the policy?

Hello MindFuq,
I only know Gaim as messenger client, which supports ICQ, Jabber,

Hello David,
Thx for the interview Mr. Shaw :o)
Mmh, that seems to me a better or more flexible way as to add

@_subject: Personal prefs (was Re: --group questions) 
Hello David,
And another question or a discrepancy:
If i set digest-algo RIPEMD160 in my gpg.conf, always RIPEMD160 is used.
My preferences are: S10 S9 S8 S7 S1 S2 S4 H3 H2 Z2 Z1 [mdc]
So i want, that RIPEMD160 is always used for signing a file or
message (not a reply with encryption to a recipient). But if i delete
digest-algo RIPDEMD160, SHA-1 is used - why? That isn't so with
encryption. Without setting cipher-algo TWOFISH, TWOFISH is always used.
So i have to set digest-algo RIPEMD160, but this would violate the
preferences in the case of encrypting & signing to a recipient.

Hello Graham,
You are right, unfortunately, all GnuPG shells under Linux, say GPA or
Seahorse are out-of-date and provide only a very small choice to use all
the options, commands etc.with a 'click' ;)
But on the other side, all MUAs under Linux have a good support for all necessary GnuPG functions and for the rest i think, the most Linux users
are using the shell or scripts so the most of them don't need any GnuPG GUI like WinPT or GPGshell. You are switching from Windows to Linux? You have to learn & love the console - sooner or later ;o))

@_subject: [fyi] OpenPGP in Python 
found it over a weblog. Perhaps it is interesting for somebody.
OpenPGP in Python
Welcome to the happy homepage of an OpenPGP implementation written in
Python. The implementation is available as a package which contains a
simple command line application and API (which is being used to run the
demonstrations here). The implementation package depends on PyCrypto.
This implementation provides support for typical signing, verifying,
encrypting, and decrypting of OpenPGP data and should work fine with the
latest versions of GnuPGP and PGP (older versions may not be compatible
with the latest improvements to the OpenPGP draft). This implementation
currently does not support clearsigned nests, key generation, or key
manipulation (all on the list of things to do). It also does not support
some "fancy" signatures, the use of which are in question (or at least
questionable), a la 3rd party and timestamp signatures.
The original goal was to create a key server that required signatures
for key updates. Starting with the pgpmsg-1.0 packet reader and fiddling
with signing code, the temptation to do a complete implementation grew.
This is the beginning of the end result.

@_subject: Handling of different key types with GnuPG 
i had some difficulties to encrypt or sign with GnuPG 1.2.3 to two
recipients, both using two different versions of PGP 6.5.8. The first
key was from 1998 and GnuPG said me, that the key had no preferences,
because "PGP 2.X style keys have no preferences". So the compliance
option "pgp6" could not be working. With pgp2 all worked fine.
OK, i have different gpg.conf files to deal with keys from different
PGP versions and i switch to them with Sylpheeds action feature on the
fly. But what is the best way to handle a large key base with all kinds
of keys? Detect and export all keys with a special type to an own
pubring? But than i have the same problem again to remember the used key
type and to take the correct gpg.conf.
So i think, it would be nice to have an "option" for the gpg.conf to
define for a group of keys the right compliance option. E. g. something
keygroup1 keyid1,keyid2,keyidn pgp2
keygroup2 keyid1,keyid2,keyidn gnupg
and so on...
I don't know, if something like that is possible or useful.

Hi David,
thx, very informative.
from the man:
OpenPGP states that an implementation should generate v4 signatures but
PGP versions 5 and higher only recognize v4 signatures on key material.
Do you know, which pgp versions have difficulties with v4 data
signatures or is this refered to *all* versions up to PGP 8?
This option forces v3 signatures for signatures on data.
Note that this option overrides --ask-sig-expire, as v3 signatures
cannot have expiration dates. --no-force-v3-sigs disables this option.
So with --gnupg i cannot have an expiration date as with --openpgp or
And what is with combinations like
--openpgp --force-mdc
--gnupg --no-force-v3-sigs
Overwrites --openpgp/--gnupg the other options?
