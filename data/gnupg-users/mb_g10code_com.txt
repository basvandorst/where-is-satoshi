@_subject: [Announce] Gpg4win 1.0.2 released 
We are pleased to announce the availibility of Gpg4win, version 1.0.2.
The gpg4win project aims at updating the gpg4win Windows installation
package with GnuPG encryption tool, associated applications and
documentation on a regular basis.  Especially the documentation
(handbooks "Einsteiger" and "Durchblicker") are directly maintained as
part of the gpg4win project.
It is an international project. Due to the origin of the project the
German language is fully supported.  As of now the the handbooks are
only available in German.  People helping with translations are very
The main difference compared to all other similar approaches (mainly
GnuPP, GnuPT, Windows Privacy Tools and GnuPG-Basics) is that the
first thing developed was the *gpg4win-Builder*. This builder allows
to easily create new gpg4win.exe installers with updated components.
The builder runs on any decent Unix system, preferable Debian
GNU/Linux.  Almost all products are automatically cross-compiled for
integration into the installer.
With this concept it is hoped to *prevent quick aging of the*
*installer package*. This is due to easier updating and less
dependancy on single developers.
Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.2 (2006-05-30)
 * Fixed a bug in GPA which led to a non-working backup on some
   Windows systems.
 * Updated Sylpheed-Claws to the latest stable version.
 * Included components are:
   (Marked packages are updated since the last release) For installation instuctions, please visit  or
read on.
Developers who want to *build an installer* need to get the following
files from  :
  gpg4win-1.0.2.tar.bz2 (3.9M)
  gpg4win-1.0.2.tar.bz2.sig
The second file is a digital signature of the the first file.  Either
check that this signature is fine or compare with the checksums given
below.  (see also The *ready to use installer* is available at:
    (6.2M)
  Or using the ftp protocol at:
  ftp://ftp.gpg4win.org/gpg4win/gpg4win-1.0.2.exe  (6.2M)
  ftp://ftp.gpg4win.org/gpg4win/gpg4win-1.0.2.exe.sig
SHA1 and MD5 checksums for these files are given below.
If you don't need the German PDF manuals, you might alternatively
download the "light" version of the installer:
    (4.6M)
   1.0.2.exe.sig
or using the ftp protocol at:
  ftp://ftp.gpg4win.org/gpg4win/gpg4win-1.0.2.exe  (4.6M)
  ftp://ftp.gpg4win.org/gpg4win/gpg4win-1.0.2.exe.sig
A separate installer with the the sources used to build the above
installer is available at:
  ftp://ftp.gpg4win.org/gpg4win/gpg4win-src-1.0.2.exe  (41M)
  ftp://ftp.gpg4win.org/gpg4win/gpg4win-src-1.0.2.exe.sig
Most people don't need this source installer; it is merely stored on
that server to satisfy the conditions of the GPL.  In general it is
better to get the gpg4win builder tarball (see above) and follow the
instructions in the README to build new installers; building the
installer is not possible on Windows machines and works best on
current Debian GNU/Linux systems (we use the mingw32 package from

We like to thank the authors of the included packages, the NSIS
authors, all other contributors and first of all, those folks who
stayed with us and tested the early releases of gpg4win.
Happy hacking,
  Jan, Marcus, Timo and Werner
