@_subject: How to interprete the output of --export-ownertrust? 
Hi everyone,
with the command gpg2 --export-ownertrust I can cause GnuPG to display the owner trust values of the public keys in my keyring.
The problem: I don't know how to interprete the numbers to the right of the fingerprints:
C:\Users\ckr>gpg2 --export-ownertrust
gpg: verwende Vertrauensmodell PGP
# Liste der zugewiesenen Trustwerte, erzeugt am 02/28/16 13:42:21
Mitteleurop?ische Zeit
# ("gpg --import-ownertrust" um sie zu restaurieren)
What is the meaniong of 3? And of 6? Does anybody know what the possible values are that can be displayed?
Is there a mapping between these numbers and the owner trust values like "unknown", "marginal", "complete" and so on?
I know, the answer lies in the source code. But unfortunately I am not able to read or understand source code.
Best regards Christine

@_subject: Procedure of deriving a pruivate key from the password 
I only have a vague and incomplete understandig of the procedure in which GnuPG derives a private key from a password.
As far as I know each private key is stored in the private keyring by a The generation of the private key is as following:
1. The user creates a password.
2. GnuPG adds an accidential bit sequence (= salt) to the password. The bit sequence is stored seperatedly from the password.
3. Password and Salt (bit sequence) are concatenated.
4. This concatenation is hased by the hash function in use Steps 2 to 4 builds up one iteration.  I can control the number of iterations by the option --s2k-count.
After the last iteration the resulting hash value is mangled. The result of this mangling process ist the private key.
Question 1: What exactly is "mangling"?
Question 2: Did I get a correct understanding of the key derivation process or am I wrong?
(Sry for my weird english.)
Best regards Christine
