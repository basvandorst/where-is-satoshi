That is very interesting! I checked Werner's, yours and my key.
With yours everything is fine, with Werner's there is one issue and
with mine the same issue as with Werner's and also it says with my key that
it is ASCII armored, which is not the case because i exported as binary.
I ask also several people on Win / Mac boxes which could get my key
via WKD. You could also fetch my key with your latest GnuPG version,
under Linux, IIRC.

Hi all,
I recently read about ZKPs and was wondering if some of you have used
them in the past. I ask because I think (once met in person) it would be a good method
when using ZKPs addionally (maybe for the paranoid among us) with
encrypted communications, where the involved parties may not be sure
if their online computer is already compromised.
The good think about ZKPs, as I have tested with one example code, is
that they can be carried out on (scentific) poket calculators.
Any thoughts or tips and tricks would be very welcome!

People know there that there are issues for a decade with the software running

And when things later happen, like recently, they still run their servers.
I wonder why those SKS key servers are so important to be still in service as

Good write-up. Now I have a question, in hope that SKS operators are
reading this too. I have learned from Robert's gist that the max. is
150.000 sigs per key the servers can handle, if I am not mistaken.
How do they handle the following:
Bob uploads his key from a key signing party with 100 sigs to server
A. Mallory and Eve attended the key signing party too and signed Bob's
key. Mallory uploads Bob's key with an additional 100k sigs on server B
and Eve does the same with server C.
Lets assume that server B and C syncs before A. What does server
B accepts then from C and vice versa, because of the 150k sig limit?
Will at the end server A, B and C have different key sets from Bob,
because of the 150k limit?

Hi all,
I am curious what apps you are using when not at home, to send
OpenPGP compatible email messages? Do you carry a Notebook with
GnuPG or do you use an OpenPGP smartphone app?
Because I do not have a smartphone and I do not want to carry
a Notebook with me I came up with the following solution for me.
Due to some tests I found Mailvelope an OpenPGP extension for
Firefox and Chrome and installed it on my Kanguru Defender 3000
USB stick. Besides the new Mailvelope keyserver I added also Hagrid.
Key management is quite comfortable and messages sending is also
very easy. A lot of free mail providers support Mailvelope.
This set-up allows me to use OpenPGP not only in an Internet Caf? etc.
but also at work where I can't install a MUA like Thunderbird or even
install GnuPG.
P.S. my posting should not bee seen as an advertisement for Mailvelope
but this is currently a mobile solution I have found for me and maybe
it could be useful for others as well. I am all ears what other mobile
solutions are available and which one you use.

So, why then all this sigs stuff, Mr Zimmermann invented, while no
other public key crypto software has such functionallity?
Why do you or other people think it is central, when we would
have many CAs in place, each one not connected to the other one?
And even if it would be run by one CA people don't trust, they could
trust the CA sig, if the signing procedure would be correct.
I for example do not trust third party sigs from regular users,
because I have withnessed that also people sign other peoples
keys out of the blue, while never ever contacting the person who

easy to use. You simply put in the (current) IP Adress, connect and then
read some displayed letters to each other, to prevent MITM, and then

Why do you think GnuPG is useless if you check the source-code, run it on hardware you trust, and a Linux variant you trust, with a Chromium/Iron browser, and avoid anything google or microsoft or apple or any non-FOSS product??
Why do you think FOSS is more secure? Do you think that people
always check the source code, with every release of their OS updates or the GnuPG updates? I doubt that. And how about FOSS developers? Do they regularly check their sites if the code was exchanged and if their keys are already compromised? The detached signatures or hashes of FOSS software are not time stamped. Is / was FOSS, like GnuPG, ever audited by major and trustworthy institutions, were users could read reports about their findings? Can you always trust developers, because they have many sigs on their keys but not sign back the signers keys?
I have learned in the past trust nobody. Therefore I would not rely
on  people from the GnuPG ecosystem and what they say.
Last but not least don?t forget rule 41, for example, which allows the FBI to hack computers worldwide. And if they can hack and access computers then others can do so too. You also never read here best practice tips like use a second computer, not connected to the Internet, and GnuPG in command line mode. ?

Hi Werner and all,
may i ask who had the brilliant idea to allow super large photos
in OpenPGP keys?
I ask, because when one likes to add a photo GnuPG recommends
the size of 240x288 Pixels, which is a good choice.
However when looking at parse-packet.c it says at line 44:
 MAX_ATTR_PACKET_LENGTH    ( 16 * 1024*1024)
Isn't this not a bit to much? I mean if i am right those
numbers mean 16MB for me.
To test this out i created a 24bit color gradient image
8000x8000 pixels in size and GnuPG says:
[ unbekannt ] (2)  [jpeg image of size 3889016] so
only little bit lesser than 4MB.
Was this large image size requested so that people
in crypto circles can hide stuff in images etc. and then
use key servers as secret distribution medium?
Just curious, because otherwise it would not make to
much sense to me.

Good question! I think a recommendation is already to late, because
like Peter said one can change the values. To be honest i don't
understand why this was implemented this way in the first place,
but it should be not my business i guess and people might use
it as a replacement for Yakamo K's image uploader to SKS, because
GnuPG makes it convenient to view then such images.
GnuPG itself suggests an image size of 240x288 pixels when doing so.
Maybe slightly larger would be fine too.
Not yet, but it should be interesting to parse a dump.
I did not ask for action here, even if it sounded like that. I was
curious to know why such a large size was implemented.

Hi Peter,
Yes, i think you did, even if i see things a bit different. But no worries! :-)
Since this is an interesting subject, i believe, i may check out how much
payload can be put in such large jpeg images, just out of of interest
and i may, if time allows, try to get hold of a complete key server dump
to try to see if i can find something interesting.
Yes, agreed! However, as it currently is there is no need for bad actors
because people have plenty of image space in a key.

O.k. i did a quick check on github for proper tools and found this
very interesting tool, written in Golang.
The provided Chief Wiggum image contains a 2 seconds .mp4 movie
clip. Pretty awesome imho! So this means that one can hide in a PGP
key movies and other files too, hidden in jpeg images and distribute
it securely via SKS...

Sorry, yes you are right it is the maximum packet size,
but as understood used for images only. Or are there
any more attribute packets like No. 1? (i have to check
the draft, i guess.)
There are different packets for each purpose, as understood.
What i really don't get with this DoS stuff is when one uses with
friends etc. the regular version of GnuPG / PGP and obtains the
keys from friends, checks the fingerprint why should one worry?
Sure, if i customize the source code I can do such stuff to other keys
on SKS key servers, but then people can still ask their friends and
say "hi there seems to be something wrong with your key, can you
mail me please a copy".
Or are there cases when messages are in transient and can those
be quickly modified, so that GnuPG crashes (your system)?

Everything works as expected. One only needs to use then:
gpg --list-keys --list-options show-photo 359A1872F120F7E7

Very nice and easy workflow and the resulting key is only 61KB in size.

Hi all,
while inspired by the replies from dkg and Damien, in the "gpg > addphoto"
thread, i tried to see if i can see how many images for photo-id's are in a
whole key dump and what size the images have.
I tried two methods.
With GnuPG[1]i saved out 32088 jpeg images from all single dump files,
while with method two , were i used jpegextrator[2], i obtained from a
joined dump, done with cat, the following result:
Extracted 86506 JPEG file(s) with 1236388001 bytes from 1 input file(s).
Now i wonder why i have such high discrepancies in the numbers?
I would very much appreciate if someone can explain this to me!
[1]Method used with GnuPG:
In gpg.conf i put: photo-viewer "cat > %K.%t"
and then i used this one liner:
for filename in ./*.pgp; do gpg --list-keys --list-options show-photo --keyring "${filename}"; done

Thank you very much for your explanation, much appreciated!
Yes, i scrolled through half of them and you are correct, there are
some false positives in it. But not so much that they would explain
the difference in the numbers.
Could it maybe the case that my old iMac (ten years old) is to slow
for this task with GnuPG and cat, so that my rig can't keep up
parsing and then writing to disk etc.?
To be sure i tried also only to parse a single dump (keydump-sks-0000)
and it showed me also (with another tool) more images than GnuPG
would have shown me.

177 bytes and is 60x60 pixels in size with 88,9 DPI and the largest
image has 3624053 bytes and is 10208x14032 pixels large, 72 DPI.
So taking the smallest image and looking at the %U part i am
wondering what key data is encoded in this base32 string?

is taken. Here for example an old key from me:

uid        [ widerrufen] [jpeg image of size 8569]
uid        [ widerrufen] [jpeg image of size 30119]
If i base32 encode the string "jpeg image of size blah..." i get
not the same results. If i base32 decode the strings i get
binary output which i don't understand. Also when using xxd
output and then running through a conversion i get output
i can't interpret.

Problem solved. :-) A very good Usenet friend explained it to me.
To compute the hash of an image one has to add a 22bytes header
to the image and then the hash will be properly computed.

Interesting topic, which i am interested in as well. I started, as German

I agree with Professor Green. Maybe he and his students can
program a POC something more simple, preferably in Golang and
while using the NaCl* library.
I think also (sorry to say this Werner!) the problem is that
GnuPG is Linux cli based and not like MacPGP from Mr. Zimmermann,
back in the 90's was GUI based with much lesser commands and
easier to learn. There was back then no Enigmail or other
MUA plug-ins and you could simply copy and paste your messages.
A real "modern" GnuPG should be IMHO the same as PGP was GUI based
back then. The GUI could be also cross-platform QT based, for
I also don't understand why GnuPG needs so many components, like
pinentry, dirmngr and gpg-agent plus GnuPG itself, while MacPGP
from Mr Zimmermann was only one program.

(pronounced salt) pub key which I use now with friends for email

I also used PGP since the mid 90's and later used PGP and finally
GnuPG. Nowadays I use the super cool box* (plus base91 as armor)
with friends and for .pdf documents I use eIDAS conform signatures,
so that I am compatible in the EU. I also experimented with
encrypted Fax documents, but the armor GnuPG uses produces to
many erros with OCR FOSS software. I had better luck with codegroup
armor and Googles OCR, when uploading encrypted documents.

possibility to remove that data, for what ever reason a person might
Or say you are in the strong set, and later you figure out that a
person in the strong set is a criminal, you do not want any longer
associated with his / her signature on your key.
Then also don't forget that only GnuPG and one other tool has a WoT,
which even dgk could in one reply to me never explain what it is good
for. People may later change their careers and no longer, for what
ever reason they might have, do not want to be associated with the WoT.

One more thing... You uploaded your keys with friends signatures to

is located in a country you visit for holidays, but this country may
not be as democratic as the country you live in and it may even
have a crypto usage ban.
The tool I currently use with friends can't bring me in possible
trouble that much, because it bears no data on my key from me and
the key ring with the keys from my friends has only nickname
entries (I can freely choose) for their keys.

Apologies for my late reply, I have overlooked your reply, sorry!
I would even say if --ask-cert-level would be a default it does
not guarantee how carefully a user has done key management. If you
look at WWW based key server interfaces you seldom see people who
have a policy link attached to their signature. And even if they would have
one, they differ from user to user, making to understand the WoT harder.
I tried to formulate such a policy a while ago, to strengthen the classical
(global) WoT a bit, but responses to my procedure were minimal.
Normally one needs only a few commands to use GnuPG successfully for
encryption and signing messages or encrypting files. Sure, when looking
at the GnuPG FAQ or the source code of GnuPG it is first to much
what someone has to study before he / she can use the software.

show up then their page, right?
Regard?ng archive.org, I think if one request the deletion of data
there they have to follow too, same as Google and any others.

I think the biggest problems is how can PGP or GnuPG users tell other users,
not familar with email encyrption yet, what else to use ...
PGP / GnuPG users are pretty biased IMHO when it comes to email encryption
and probably don't accept other and more modern solutions, which they could
recommend. All those recent or older articles speak about non-email solutions.
I for myself solved that problem with friends and now look for an additional
solution to create offline S/MIME compatible messages, which then can easily
been read by various MUAS. If someone has an idea I am all ears. I don't
care about Efail, because I have not heard in practice that Mallory attacked
already lot's of S/MIME users.

That is simple, indeed. But how do you exchange passphrases for
the encrypted files in advance and do you switch them regularly
or leave them the same when dealing with many clients?
I solved this with using NaCl public keys, bearing no infos of
the key owners and having a little key ring, where I only assign
nicknames to the pub keys. The software I use is box
in combination with a base91 encoder / decoder, for ASCII armor,
when sending encrypted emails. Before that I also experimented with other tools, like dhbitty,
MiniLock and Pretty Curved Privacy etc. but for me they all had
some disadvantages compared to box.

Hi all,
now since we have Hagrid and WKD I was wondering if in the future an
additional paramemter like --add-me for --lsign would make sense, for
people still in need of a WoT?
The idea would be that people --lsign each others keys and GnuPG,
or other public key crypto software, would then save an additional
file in the key ring, allowing users to exchange that blob so that
only they can see that other people, which belong to their WoT, have
lsigend their pub key.
Well, just a thought ...

To be more precise, when exporting a blob it should be something like
--export-blob Alice, so that users can individually choose what parts
of the blob will be exchanged, so that they do not have to reveal the
whole blob, containing all lsigned users.

Claws-Mail is a MUA/NUA like Thunderbird. It includes GPG plug-ins.
Regarding multiple key, I don't know what you mean, sorry.
When I send messages (online) in the past with Claws-Mail I only
send to single individuals.
If you mean multiple keys for yourself, I never checked this,

Claws-Mail for multiple keys.

Thank you, but what I mean is having an exportable 'blob' for the lsign
command, which can be then exchanged and would not be compatible with
key servers, in case someone would try to upload such a blob. This is
what I mean with invisible WoT, so that users do not need to --sign
a key, use lsign instead but still having WoT sigs, without revealing
their WoT to other third parties. Hope this makes sense.

@_date: 2019-07-31 16:25:37
@_author: Stefan Claas 
@_subject: --lsign --add-me or the invisible WoT 
Correct. To make it a bit more clear ...
I lsign Bob's key so third parties do not know (normally) that I did
this. But how could my friend Alice trust Bob's key she has without
my non-exportable lsign sig?
What I tried to propose is an additional parameter, like --add-me
which would write a 'blob' to a second file.db where I can export
then Bob's blob (non-compatible to SKS etc.) with my --lsign sig,
and give it to my friend Alice. Later If Alice knows Bob better
or personally knows him she can --lsign --add-me Bob's key ('blob')
too and give it to her friend Mary. Mary would have then a 'blob"
from Bob containing my and Alice's lsigs, which are non-compatible
to key servers, but would be IMHO equal to classic WoT sigs.
So to speak it is meaned for little WoTs (for those who needs them)
where participants don't have to fear that their sigs are published
in the future on whatever key servers we have, to not reveal their
social graphs.

Tor, socat and stunnel and then send the config Nym message to
the registration email address. There are hover .onion relays
available for Mixmaster Remailers, but I do not have them because
I use YAMN nowadays.
With News Servers I used them in the past also with Tor, socat and
stunnel. I may ask a friend if he has .onion addresses for them.

Interesting to read young peoples thoughts. Can you give a good reason why
key servers should be a decentralized distributing medium? For Warez etc,
like p2p Networks I can understand this. Why not let key servers be run, like this new one, on behalf of Government
Institutions, or commercial Services etc. like S/MIME ldap Servers?
Would a dissident or other people really benefit from the old style key
server medium? I mean when third parties have them on their radar it
would not help them much, right?
The only benefit I see is that 3rd parties, not known to us, can do
"research" with a key dump, without letting us know. With a centralized
approach and run on behalf by proper authorities this would be not
possible, and if, they can do this anyways with what we have now.

Maybe you can consider in the future at least to allow CA sigs.
Those would be only one sig per key and the CA signing keys
could be stored in your database as reference as well.
Currently 3 CAs come to mind: Governikus, Heise and CAcert.
Maybe other CAs will show up in the future if you model
would support it and then we don't have to deal with the
classical WoT anymore.
Well, only a suggestion!

Hi all,
appologies for posting this, but I think it could
be of interest for GnuPG users, because ProtoMail
uses the OpenPGP protocol too.
Some of you may have signed up with ProtonMail and
enjoy the service, due to it's ease of use and they
think they are anonymous, when using this service.
At least ProtonMail says so on their main page.
I have a different understanding of what anonymous
email is, because not only PGP usage but also the
use of anonymous email services is a hobby of mine
which I use since the mid 90's.
O.k. lets get started with a little test (I did a
while ago):
Fire up Tor browser and register at the ProtonMail
site for a free email account and use as a user
name a string from random.org.
When ProtonMail ask you for verification (...????)
of your email account select SMS and use as
SMS service a free one like:
I just choose for a new test, which I did a couple
of minutes ago, Poland and received there the SMS
After entering the required verification
code ProtonMail says that either the email
address or the phone number is already taken
and then denies the account creation.
Since the user name string can't be taken
already it tells me that they keep track
of SMS numbers.
If you choose for example the U.S. SMS
number then ProtonMail says that this
number was used to many times and also
denies the account creation.
To come to an end, I do consider this
verification procedure *not* anonymous
and wonder why ProtonMail does not use
captchas to see if a human registers.

What is the purpose behind an unlinked hash. A spammer using their system, without a hash function
could send successfully spam to other users, because
ProtonMail is not blacklisted. When that happens a
user receiving this spam can report that, so that
actions can be taken. This of course requires then
a bit of work, at the ProtonMail site, to remove
the spammers account.
Why do they use unlinked hashes? If I could sign up
anonymously the hash could also be linked to my account
and even if thousands of people have the same hash they
could remove the spammers account.
Should an unlinked hash protect users from a powerful
adversary? O.k. people can now laugh at me, because
I am no programmer nor cryptographer or math-geek. My
assumption is that a powerful adversary has a list of
all global mobile phone numbers, computes quickle the
hashes for them and saves them also in a database.

What I will do, as soon as I have the funds, is using an offline
computer with an USB to USB null modem cable and CoolTerm to create
messages on the offline computer, transfer them via the cable and
then send them with the online computer, which then can be compromised
again, without having any crypto software on that machine. For receiving PGP-MIME messages I already have an encoder, so that
I can later then transform those messages to the offline computer,
so that GnuPG can decrypt them.

I will give tails a try soon, but not for PGP usage.
I will go for my procedure, involving an offline Notebook
and a second key (which I have now on keybase).
This will give users the option, when communicating with
me, that they either can choose my keybase key, which I
think is a good idea from keybase, because it would allow
IMHO people to travel to the U.S. without carrying a secret
key with them, in case border patrol checks computers etc.
and my offline key for "important" stuff, which then will
be also used to sign all outgoing messages, regardless
which key is used.
I think it is a good procedure and in case stuff like
tempest attacks etc. would came into play then it is
game over, for a normal EU citizen like me. But at
least it should keep hackers away from my GnuPG and
box encrypted communications.

Not to rain your parade, but I follow the topic encryption since the mid '80s
and can say nowadays that GnuPG has failed to become an email encryption
product for the masses, which IIRC was the initial goal of Mr Zimmermann's PGP
back in the early ninetees.
Instead GnuPG became the ultimate tool for PGPGs[1].
Try the following experiment, as power user: Explain to your loved ones,
friends and co-workers GnuPG usage (with all its surrounding stuff like
installing MUAs and plug-ins, besides of GnuPG) point them to the FAQ as
learning resource and then show them as modern alternative Mailvelope
or the new Autocrypt from Vincent ...
Once done consider again why in modern software design ease of use is an
important factor, if you like to reach out to the masses and want to
convince people to use software based on the OpenPGP protocol.

Hi all,
I was wondering if native English speakers can help me out in finding 'the
right' 5 letter words which can be used in an binary to words encoder/decoder,
which then can be used with GnuPG encrypted binary files, so that these
(preferably small binary blobs) messages can then be send over telephone, radio
or as letter/fax.
I already contacted my Golang programmer who wrote me yesterday such an
encoder/decoder and I have already created a dictionary with German 5 letter
words, which are IMHO easy to speak and they contain no 'offensive' etc. words.
The encoder uses for every byte combination [0-255] a single 5 letter word. For
sure, this is not so effective as codegroups[1] but IMHO faster to speak and to
write down.
Here is a very small GnuPG symmetrically encrypted message, run through the

the NATO alphabet is perfect for!

Let's assume the following, I would use the PGP wordlist and give
my software for a test to a German user and let's say a Japanese
user. Both of them have basic English skills. If one person then speaks the words from the PGP wordlist to the
other and he / she has to write down these words you can be sure
that this is *not* 100 percent error free and fast, in comparison
to my approach, which requires only to learn six easy words and
ten digits (which can be accomplished by a six year old kid).

Hi Werner and all,
I was wondering why the binary file size when using symmetric AES

so far.
As an example encrypting a text file containing 'Hello World':
gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 hw.txt gives me a file
size of 87 Bytes.
Doing the same with openssl, for example:

Can you tell us what rumors you have heared? I would say the encryption
in GnuPG is secure, but sadly people tend to use encryption software on
online computers due to many tutorials, MUA plug-ins and their lazyness
and therefore it can never been guaranteed that the communications are
always secure.
P.S. Question for Werner and all the other hackers. Would it be very
difficult to read out the required decryption parameters, like p&q so to
speak, with a specially crafted software, when using an online computer
with a SmardCard? I have read that the secret key can not been copied from
the card, but what about the 'bits and pieces' in memory when decrypting?

Unfortunately I am no programmer but I was thinking about the following:
I assume that in order to decrypt a message the secret key data must be
unlocked and loaded for a very short time into the computers RAM, in order
to perform the decryption, or am I wrong with my assumption?
And if I am not wrong, would that be very difficult to get the parameters
from the secret key or does GnuPG somehow (tries to) prevent this?
Sorry for this question but I like to learn more about how this works
and if I should invest in a smardcard in the future, for online usage.

If you would use your real name in your UID you could let Governikus

For that you will need a (certified) ID-card reader and AusweisApp2.
Regarding the other questions, it would be IMHO really nice if we

not rely on the classical WoT signatures.

AusweisApp reads your personal data from your ID-card and then Governikus
certifies your key, containing your real name. Your key does not need to
have other personal data besides your real name.
My UID for example looks like this: Stefan Claas *offline key* I know that there is as second Stefan Claas living in Germany, but
he will not have the same email address like I have. So people looking
up key servers could then find of course (if he would upload a key too)
a second Stefan Claas.
I have no expierence when one relocates, but as I see it it does not matter
as long as you are a holder of a German ID-card.

@_subject: Making a subkey a standalone Master key 
I have just checked my pub key, I created there a month ago, for testing
purposes, of this account.
What would happen if one creates a master key with only signing capabilities
and no certification capablities? And then create a second key pair with
the proper master key and try to combine those with what skeeto once mentioned
with his pgp key-poisoner, i.e. that it is possible to bind sub keys to someone
elses pub key?
Because Protomail only uses the encryption sub key, with a different fingerprint
it should not matter, right? I see there no problem if the submitted Master key
there has a different fingerprint and only signing capabilities.
Maybe worth a try.

Hi all,
maybe interesting for some of you.
I just noticed that, after installing Golang under Termux
that Termux has also GnuPG already installed.
Would people recommend using pure GnuPG on a smartphone,
compared to a (compromised?) PC?
I ask, because I have not read yet what attacks (remotely)
are possible with smartphones, to obtain the secret keys.
Any pointers to articles would be very welcome!

I see in your address 'Nitrokey' and I was wondering (I have USB on my Samsung

Nitrokey drivers which must be detected via Termux, so that it would work?

Well, I do have YubiKeys and a Nitrokey too, but I would say while they can't obtain your private key they will for sure
know the passphrase (PIN) used and the content you encrypted/decrypted on your smartphone.
I came up yesterday with the idea to use an additional offline laptop[1] connected to my smartphone via a USB OTG cable
and an FTDI USB to USB cable, costs for both less then 20 USD. When both devices are connected one uses on the laptop
CoolTerm (cross-platform) and on the Android device serial usb terminal, available on the PlayStore.
As of my understanding (please someone proofs me wrong) an attacker would have a hard time to know the encrypted content
created on the offline laptop.

Good question. There is software for Andoid available called OpenKeyChain,
which as understood is the defacto standard for Android smartphone users,
in combination with a MUA for Android.
The question IMHO now is what should mobile device users do now? I showed
a solution, assuming those users have an offline laptop too, which then
would allow them to comfortably and securely create their messages.
Not all people can purchase now a new smartphone with a more secure OpenSource
OS and new SIM, I assume.
I also do not know if it is common if people use an (compromised?) online
laptop, as a smartphone, when on the road.

For me it looks like that encryption al? OpenPGP, whether iOS or Android

is affordable for the majority of us and easy to use, so that people
do not need to use good old email encryption for important things,

Fully agree!
I must admit that I only use a smartphone for a couple of months now, because I wanted to see what things I can do with it.
Besides that I must also say that I am no fan of smartphone technology.
You say that we must be careful that not someone roots our smartphone. As understood a Pegasus operator can do what ever
he likes to do remotely, anonymously with our (Android/iOS) smartphone, without that we know that this happens. And then
some people may also have problems with their Desktop computer, in case FinFisher and friends allows zero-clicks too, which
we don't know.
So, to sum it up (I know you prefer Tails) would you agree that sooner or later the community should develop strategies,
in form of a best practice FAQ (cross-platform), to no longer use encryption software on online devices and work out
strategies to use offline devices and how to handle this data securely over to an online device, until proper and affordable
hardware encryption devices for online usage are available?

Yes, you are right. While I am no programmer I would assume that designers

do not have to deal with a boatload of large software components, burned
into ROMS.
Yes, a risk, but at what price? I could imagine that many people do not
care to much if it hurts journalists or activists from foreign countries.

While I personally stopped using online encryption, long ago, after my

that YubiKeys and Nitrokeys allow also login-in protection via 2FA and
that than sudo usage requires also tapping on the YubiKey, besides pw
usage. Not sure if it is the same procedure with a Nitrokey.

apologies for not quoting each paragraph from you!
No doubt that a system tool (like Werner says) like GnuPG or any others for
that matter, which are free and OpenSource, are good tools people rely on.
We all know that threats for online devices exist and mostly bugs or security
holes are more or less quickly discovered and fixed.
I believe that users interested in security and privacy always try to strive
for the best solutions available, regardless of their threat model, i.e. what
is good for activists or journalist in oppressed regimes etc. (which received
advice and how-to's from professionals) may also be good for us, when trying
to protect things we are doing online.
My concern however, with the advancement of these powerful tools is that this
is already a 'Russian roulette' while there is currently no defense AFAIK against
them or guarantees that these tools are not been misused by third parties.

Hi Werner and all GnuPG hackers,
I would like to ask if it is possible in a future version of
GnuPG to have a new OpenPGP packet defined, which would allow
GnuPG users that their public key can be no longer uploaded
to the the old SKS keyserver Network, so that SKS rejects the
OpenPGP Public Key Block? Maybe this packet request could be
added in form of the key-generation process, so that GnuPG
users will be asked by GnuPG if they like to have old-style
SKS support or not.
I ask this because I can imagine that some people do not want
that their new public key block is accidently uploaded and
distributed without their consent.
It is assumed that the SKS Network will not go away in the near
future and it is assumed once such a new non-compatible SKS packet
would be supported by GnuPG it could be quickly supported by modern
Hagrid, Mailvelope and hockeypuck.

I thought about this technique a bit for easy to remember passwords, which
can be converted to strong passwords.
Let's say you travel a lot and do not want to risk that your secret key
gets compromised due to border control etc.
One simply uses the program passphrase2pgp, from GitHub[1] and when creating
the key and the passphrase is needed, one simply issues:
echo -n 'simple password' | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base91 or base64
and then one gets a string with an entropy of over 200, which is more than
secure. This would one IMHO allow to have a strong passphrase but generated
with an easy to remember password.
Here's a little Go program, wich does this without the above commands,
so that it can be used on Windows without OpenSSL:
package main

    fmt.Println(base91.EncodeToString([]byte(hash[:])))
    fmt.Println(base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(hash[:]))
One simply starts the program and then types the easy to
remember password and presses enter and the program returns
a base91 and base64 string to choose from.
And with passhprase2pgp one needs always to remember the
Unix Expoch Time, for key creation, so that always the
same secret key will be generated.

Thanks for the valuable input!
While the echo and OpenSSL commands leave it in your history, the Go program does not display it in history.
Also, when using a Windows Computer, without gpg4win installed, this could maybe useful too, because nobody would
see that you have GnuPG installed and one installs it only after arrival.
Or one use this technique with other symmetric encryption software, or for login credentials and telling family
and friends only the easy to use password prior departure, which then can also be changed daily with a scheme
like password = 'Holidays Day 1', next day 'Holidays Day 2' etc. Well, just a thought ... because I thought about the entropy for a strong password, while it can be memorized

P.S. I would also say there is a difference between the article you linked to and my approach.
With the brainflayer approach one enters his/her easy to remember password into the Bitcoin software and then it
gets converted to a secret key, which then can be brute forced easily, like the article states.
With my humble approach one would input the strong password, derived from the easy to remember one.

Well, if I use a simple password like: 'Holidays Day 1' and run it through:
 for example
it gives an entropy of 62.6 bits.
If I use now this simple password and run it through my program the result is:
e|}]2$8$lI (sha256+base91)
and C9+v21t+2y8atf5y+Yj/TqHenVC//q20WbjzM+jtcLA= (sha256+base64)
which gives an entropy of 192.3 and 234.2.

Thanks for the info, much appreciated!
I must admit that I have not looked how GnuPG saves passwords, or better pass phrases. I would assume
that GnuPG does also additional salting and/or stretching.
The questions for me would be how those password cracking databases store passwords, when doing brute force.
Do they store the information, like I do with my humble approach? I have read years ago that for example
the NSA is capable of searching for seven billion passwords per second.
Additionally I could use my humble approach and tell people the following:
(Let's assume I would use 'Holidays Day 1, 2, 3 etc.') I could tell them also L or R 3 (delete 3 chars
at left or right from the strong string, and add 'house' and 'mouse' to the left and/or right.
This would then IMHO not match the database strings anymore, in case they look like my approach.

Action Alert
Members of Congress have mounted a major threat to your
security online.
The Graham-Blumenthal bill deals with the very serious issue
of child exploitation online, but it offers no meaningful
solutions. It doesn't help organizations that support
victims. It doesn't equip law enforcement agencies with
resources to investigate claims of child exploitation or
training in how to use online platforms to catch
perpetrators. Rather, the bill's authors have used defending
children as the pretense for an attack on our free speech
and security online.
Bottom line: the Graham-Blumenthal bill would give the
Attorney General far too much power to dictate how Internet
companies must operate. We all know how AG William Barr
would use that power: to break encryption.
Barr has repeatedly insisted that communications platforms
should undermine their own security in order to give law
enforcement agencies access to our private messages. The
Graham-Blumenthal bill would finally give Barr the power to
demand that those platforms obey him or face serious
repercussions, including both civil and criminal liability.
Barr's demands would put encryption providers like WhatsApp
and Signal in an awful conundrum: either face the
possibility of losing everything in a single lawsuit or
knowingly undermine their users' security, making all of us
more vulnerable to criminals.
The so-called EARN IT Act is anti-speech, anti-security,
anti-innovation, and unnecessary. Let's tell Congress to
reject it.
Take action now:

When you work in compliance mode it should be IHMO possible that people
wishing to communicate with you (from foreign countries) and may have a
different opinion about privacy, GnuPG should accept such public keys,
without using extra parameters and that you can easily add them to your
key ring, with a simple label, thus not revealing the identity of them,
in case your computer or smartphone gets later compromised or is
searched at an airport etc.

@_subject: Comparison of RSA vs elliptical keys 
Good question!
First of all I do not keep an address book on my computer
nor on my smartphone and I use not only simple smpts channels.
Regarding the mapping of email IDs and keys. When I use labels
for my keys, in my keyring, it contains only simple stuff like a
nickname for example, because the peoples email addresses I know
also without using GnuPG, hence I use command line mode and no
common plug-ins. I do not say that people should follow
this procedure, but like I previously said GnuPG should allow
such an option. I am also used to use other communication
channels, beside standard smpts, where this works too.
I don't know if you, for example, knows RSA public key encryption
before PGP was invented. There was no such things like key-IDs
email mappings etc. and people lived with it, while using email.
If you check out GitHub, GitLab etc. for public key encryption
software you will rarely find tools, if any, which use the same
email, key-ID mapping approach GnuPG uses. and people do not
complain about it.
And last but not least, GnuPG is a very flexible tool with
many many command line parameters, so why not allow this option
too for users, wishing to use UID-less public keys?
I see no harm in it, only an enrichment in it's feature set.

I understand that a UID is an integral part, for example if people

What I don't understand is why you are not liking the idea to allow
GnuPG to automatically import and process UID-less public key blocks,
if people who trust the GnuPG brand ask for this?
Nobody is asking for UID-less key creation as default behavior.
GnuPG always asks IIRC new users for their Name and email address
and does not tell them in advance that they can use a free form UID,
without an email address, thus being able to use a key for multiple
accounts or purposes, without adding additional UIDs.

for or against a feature, so that Werner has then to follow suite, or
is he in the position to say no and every dev has to follow his GnuPG

@_subject: keys require a user-id 
I would like to start the discussion, because I like to point out one
more thing, why I like the UID-less and label approach, compared to a
freeform UID.
Let's say I would regularly communicate with you, dkg and Werner etc.
In sequoia I would import the public keyblocks and could label them,
for example with rjh or rob, dkg and wk and would then use for the
recipient parameter -r rob -r dkg -r wk, which I can easily memorize.
With the freeform approach, when I would have to use (auto) generated
random chars or the fingerprint then I would have problems memorizing
if this was your, dkg's or Werner's public keyblock and it could be
also more error prone (typos), when using this method, in CLI mode.
You can argue now that you can give a freeform UID the name rob or rjh
too, but this would maybe not so good, because your are publicity known
as rob or rjh, thus defeating the purpose a bit.

@_date: 2020-05-18 14:05:41
@_author: Stefan Claas 
@_subject: keys require a user-id 
Agreed! It should be also mentioned, that if UID-less public keyblocks
end up more and more on keyservers it is harder for 3rd parties to
maintain a database, since as you know, everybody is still be able to
download complete keyserver dumps from SKS.

I ask, because don't you think that this could not have an impact on
the spread and usage of GnuPG in the EU for business purposes etc. and
for example if you would accept UID-less public keyblocks, privacy
concerned parents could for example allow their minors to use GnuPG,
while mom, dad or their teacher could sign their public keyblock?

The problem is that we IMHO still stick to procedures Mr Zimmermann,
while not being a cryptographer back then, has invented in the early
90s, which may no longer fit in 2020.
It should be also pointed out, to the interested reader, that 99% of

Hi halfdog,
you're welcome!
I only started to use sequoia pgp as a replacement for GnuPG recently,
due to performance issues on my old offline Notebook and wanted to
mention that the packet split functionality is there included too.
I would say if you use sequoia pgp as a replacement for pgpsplit it
should work the same.
At least it's worth a try, in case you find no alternative and chances
would be low that in the future such split functionality would not be
included in future versions of GnuPG.

while it is not my business, I do not understand why you have to take
care about the Thunderbird issue, as a users and not the
Aufsichtsbeh?rde ... If for example you have a job at the
Aufsichtsbeh?rde then ok, like I said, I would contact gnupg.com and
ask them if GnuPG Desktop (A Windows app) fits for your working
environment and in case not what they would suggest, because the
Aufsichtsbeh?rde should have IMHO funds to issue a professional
licensed working solution for their employees.
In case you only have to deal as a gpg4win user with the
Aufsichtsbeh?rde via email, then I don't understand how would they
detect if you would not comply by using later the new Thunderbird,
without BSI approval.
P.S. please don't take it personal!

Yes, understand. But then if those institutions have no funds or

to let gnupg.com develope a custom Windows solution for them.
The other option would be that the OP and others continue using

Hi all,
while I did some JAB-Code experiments with MMS, to send GnuPG messages with a dumb
phone, I came up now with a new idea. :-)
For that I need five people who are willing to share with me their postal address.
You can send me your address GnuPG encrypted. I will not store your address on my
computer and will delete your email, once I received it.
My new idea is to send encrypted postcards or letters, with an NFC tag attached,
containing a GnuPG clearsigned test message. I like to see if the postcards will
arrive in proper condition, so that the NFC tags are still readable.
What you will get from me:
A postcard with Berlin photos on, an address sticker from me, containing the MacPGP
2.6.2 icon with the little secret agent and a valid international postal stamp with
a photo from me on. If you are a stamp/postcard collector, you will agree that this
is IMHO a collectors item. :-)
Why I came up with this idea? Well I thought of a way to send private content digitally,
without Internet usage, so that 3rd parties outside the EU have it difficult to intercept
such messages, in order to protect EU businesses and to show the young generation that
local postal services should be supported, in favor of a globally surveilled Internet.
A standard NFC tag can't store that much data, but there are different types available
and one can use also modern encryption software which gives you more encrypted payload.
Once I received your address (first come first serve) I will prepare the postcards
(hopefully tomorrow) and send them to you. It would be nice if participants would share
their experience, so that other GnuPG users could learn from it.
Please note, NFC tags can be used multiple times, so that for example Alice and Bob use
only on NFC tag with their letters, they exchange and those NFC tags can also be destroyed
with special* hardware devices or bought in a form that they get destroyed if someone tries
to take them off, from the carrier medium.
The consumer hardware device I purchased:
Software one can use on their Desktop:

Yes, it is possible. However we have in Germany for example additional postal
services (PIN AG) one could use locally and I doubt (while I do not know)
that TLAs or LEAs currently require them to collect such data. In case of letter usage, their are also RFID protection covers available,
so I would guess that these do not show that a letter contains an NFC
I also assume that for example local postal services, regardless where
they are located have no deal yet with international TLAs, LEAs to hand
over this date.
Last but not least, they could also been used as dead drops, locally.
Cool, thanks for the info! :-)

I guess we need to figure it out, so that future generations can learn
from our experiences.
Well, this is debatable, but at least it shows GnuPG users, which rely on
IMHO outdated Internet PGP tutorials that there are other forms of GnuPG
communications available, besides classical email usage and it strengthens
the usage of GnuPG, compared to those smartphone crypto Messengers, or S/MIME
email usage etc.
People using GnuPG should appreciated these tips, even if they don't use them.

Hello Mark,
Yes, it is the same procedure, except that I used postcards.
I strongly doubt that *hard working* postmen will do this, because sooner or
later this will be detected and investigated and it would cost postmen IMHO
valuable time (which they probably don't have) to copy and send my mail to
3rd parties outside the EU. IIRC, postal services scan mail for the addresses,
for automatic sorting machines, but I have never read that they also scan
letter content within a letter or from postcards, which would violate
the confidentiality of letters, guaranteed by laws, in Germany and elsewhere.
And if you think, or someone else thinks that *hard working* postmen could
be not trusted, how about all the roots working at email providers? I am
more concerned nowadays (remember Edward Snowden handling over electronic
documents from his employer to third parties) that people (maybe part-time
or intern etc.) can handle over such data to 3rd parties outside the EU,
much much easier and without been detected.
If all Interent citizens had to / or would run their own postfix server then
this would be a different story IMHO.
Last but not least encrypted postcards were popular among couples many many
decades ago (if you google for encrypted postcards) and I think it is a valid
option, which I trust much much more than encrypted email (and I have email
since 1985).

Good question. QR codes needs for example a printer and stickers too, if
not printed directly on postcards. My new Epson printer, for example, does not support feeding of postcards or other thick materials, only standard
paper and photo paper.
Maybe we should ask ourselves why NFC tags were invented if QR-code would
be sufficient.

@_date: 2020-10-06 16:58:28
@_author: Stefan Claas 
@_subject: Five volunteers needed (EU only please) 
P.S. and NFC tags can be written multiple times to and not like QR-codes only
written one time per sticker, so probably more useful for Alice's and Bob's
letter exchanges, when using only one tag. And if one likes they can be also
password protected, prior accessing the (encrypted) content.

@_date: 2020-10-06 18:23:40

I like to promote the postcards option because the postage is cheaper than
letters if not done regularly.
Yes, but like I said, can be written to only once.
I think if people have the funds to buy a more or less expensive smartphone
they can probably invest in an additional consumer grade reader/writer (for
offline usage) too. Which my idea avoids, i.e. using super ?ber mega cool local postal services,
to support our *hard working* local postmen, instead of globally supporting
people with root privileges etc! :-D
Remember even Russian authorities, according to reports from 2013, are using
German typewriters now, which means, at least to me, that the smart Russians
are using their postal service too, or couriers, instead of email. ;-)

Hello Mark,
Yes, understand, but people who are sending (encrypted) sensitive things with
postal mail can also use security envelopes, which does not let light shine
through, can use covers for NFC tags and additionally tamper evident bags so
that a bribed postman could not photograph the content of the letter.
This is all available for purchase online. I like to say it this way, when the ARPANET and later the relatively small
Internet, compared to other global networks came up people did not rely on
encryption and their communications were somewhat more secure, because of
how OSs for the computers and the used software was designed, compared with
nowadays hardware / software components.
Well, first of all, we should ask ourselves why in the world do people get
so many many services on the Internet for *free* ...? I think it has to do
with the U.S. Supremacy & Leadership role. Normally when you or me would
start a business you would need a lot of money, then secure your business,
and finally charge users, so that you can make an income for you and your
employees and cover the monthly network traffic/hardware/maintenance costs.
Regarding Google Mail etc. These services are run on multi-user systems
and people with super-user privileges, which a root user assigned to them,
can control the whole system and does not need your encrypted and salted
password to access your account. However, your email is encrypted in transient
when it leaves the servers or arrives at servers. Modern and privacy oriented
email services like Tutanota or ProtonMail do not allow this, because their
servers encrypt you email, while it rests on the servers. Hence probably
why these modern services receive often heavily DDOS attacks...
What a lot of people probably don't know, when we had global (and local) Online
Services decades ago, like CompuServe, AOL etc, where you could also chat, write
email and had forums. users have *been charged monthly* for using these Online
Services, besides, the access points they used! And these business were successful
and had millions of users.
Later when Al Gore 'invented' the Internet all these cool and good Networks,
Online Services etc. disappeared.
In case you have access to a good library, with computer books, or can get
old computer books from sellers, I highly recommend the book "The Matrix",
from John S. Quarterman. The Book is from the late 80's and shows people
that we had plenty of global computer networks and which are all no longer
Correct, but my idea is based on that people can use the postal system with
encryption too.
Well, I think, in 2020 and ongoing it is a good and valid option and let's
see how this will pan out, i.e. hearing later politicians and LEA saying the
same thing what they say about encryption on the Internet ... Once this will
happen than we see that they need, for what ever reason, full control of
peoples digital content.

People could use as usual still common IPv4 for their regular surfing etc.
but had then the ability, with a static IPv6 address to run their own
email server and other services from home with a little Raspberry Pi etc.,
without purchasing a VPS plan, thus one would only need to register a
domain of choice and the records management could also bee done a) with
the Domain Registrar or your local ISP, instead of the VPS hosting provider.

encrypted message could not be exchanged by third parties, to
allow a pre-check (procmail etc.), like I explained, without the
need that Alice has to decrypt the message manually and then check
if the message was signed.
While not being off-topic, how does for example Zero Knowledge Proof
Encryption does a check that the identity of a user is proven, while
the user does not have to reveal his actual age? He only proves with
that, that he his over 18 years of age.

Hi all,
email might sometimes not be ideal for GnuPG encrypted data transfer,
due to attachment file size limits or that users do not like to show
to third parties the communication paths used, revealing the sender
and receiver.
Some of you may know Micah's OnionShare or Magic Wormhole etc.
The disadvantage of OnionShare is IMHO that you always must tell your
communications partner the .onion URL in advance and that it can
not be used with an Android smart phone, AFAIR.
Magic Wormhole I found to difficult to install under Windows, for the
average user, if he does not know how to fix erros, which may occur
when installing.
So I looked a while ago a bit around and found croc,
which is easy to use and written in Golang (yay :-)), thus allowing
one also to use it under Android, with Termux, for example.
While there is no information available to use it with socat (which
is also available as Windows .exe) via Tor, I noodled a bit around
and found a solution to use croc via a Tor Hidden Service Onion
The good thing is that setting up an .onion relay does only require
a cheap VPS server, without registering an own domain.
croc does not store files nor does it keep logs and only 'glues'
together both endpoints, in order to perform the transfer.
A croc operator can set a pass phrase for his relay and users can
also use pre-defined codes, which they share in advance.
Ok. here is the set-up I used:
1. Open ports 9009, 9010, 9011, 9012 and 9013 in your firewall,
on your VPS server.
Once you have set-up your Tor Hidden Service add the following lines
to your torrc:
HiddenServicePort 9009 127.0.0.1:9009
HiddenServicePort 9010 127.0.0.1:9010
HiddenServicePort 9011 127.0.0.1:9011
HiddenServicePort 9012 127.0.0.1:9012
HiddenServicePort 9013 127.0.0.1:9013
restart Tor.
Follow the instructions on GitHub on how to use croc.
As relay operator you can start your relay like this:
$ croc relay --pass="yourrelaypassphrase"
In order that you can send GnuPG encrypted documents, files or folders
via the Tor relay you and your communication partner needs of course Tor
and socat installed and the following socat onliner:
echo -n 9009 9010 9011 9012 9013 | xargs -d ' ' -I% bash -c 'socat tcp4-listen:5870,fork
What I have not figured out yet is to run this onliner properly under cmd.exe,
due to the xargs command. If you have a Windows solution for this please post
it here.
Hope you find this info useful. And if you know a better and easier way to transfer
GnuPG encrypted documents or files (cross-platform and mobile), please let me/us know.

Thinking about another option smart phone users can try (I currently
have no second smart phone).
Since I am new to smart phone usage, I figured out that one can use
a second smart phone without a SIM-Card and with WiFi disabled. :-)
This means to me, regardless if people would use Android with Termux
and GnuPG or a Linux smart phone that they simply create the messages
on the IMHO not (so easy?!) compromisable second offline smart phone and
then transfer securely the encrypted messages to the compromised online
usage smart phone.

curious as I am, If I understand it right, you use Windows XP
with Becky as MUA for GnuPG or would like to use it with the
lastest version of GnuPG?
Your posting is done via secmail.pro, a Tor email provider,
which requires AFAIK Tor Browser Bundle to access the service.
My question, if you don't mind, does the lastest Tor Browser
Bundle still supports Windows XP and how do you use Becky
with secmail.pro?

Ah, ok, thanks for the information!
Yes, it is not easy nowadays. Besides cryptography anonymous communication
is also a hobby of mine, since the early cypherpunk days and I always look
for new ways to archive that. I did recently some experiments with some well
known wannabe anonymous email services and how to register with them anonymously,
so that their security checks can be bypassed. Currently I focus on anonymous
communications in combination with offline devices, to protect better against
Pegasus, FinFisher and other crap.
Yes, blacklisting small providers is not nice, but at least users can
purchase a cheap VPS server and run their own mail server, which adds
decentralization to the email world.

Well, to be fair, people in Germany, for example, who have seen the German Edition of Shadow Gate may not know that private
contractors exits and what their role is. At least it is now known that they exist.
The other question which might come up, what is all this IIA and PsyOps stuff, people are talking about.
Maybe people have also heard of the term Cyber Warfare and wonder if it really exists and what does it do.
Knowing that the below mentioned brigade has a software running called Shadownet.
So all in all, whether people think Shadow Gate is a hoax etc. at least it is quite interesting to watch,
because it is well made and should people animate to think more what the future will bring with this hole
commercial Internet crap of today. Thanks to Bill Clinton and Al Gore for 'inventing' the Internet. Before that 'invention' the Internet was a nice place.
People who try to sign-up anonymously with Tor Browser, will face the problem that all (random) user ids are already 'taken',
thus making it impossible to sign up via Tor. Maybe you or others had luck in the past.

Robert, If you remember the other thread, I said I will do so, in *that* thread.
You should also see my reply in context with the provided URLs, which you have
not quoted.

while I can't help you with your issue, I like to suggest to take a look
at Fraunhofer SIT's modern JAB-Code, which compiles nicely under Linux,
Windows and macOS. It has also the advantage that it can carry much more
data than QR code. The color barcode withstands also ugly Facebook .jpeg
compression, in case one needs to sign large messages, with GnuPG, on
'social' media sites.

The other option GnuPG users have is to memorize the passphrase and
re-generate the private key from the passphrase, thus avoiding paper
loss etc.

good question ... I like  best, because
it only allows publishing your pub key if you decrypt their reply
with your secret key and as bonus it keeps your collected WoT sigs,
in case you need the classical WoT signatures, or CA sigs, like from
Governikus etc.
Unfortunately gpg.conf, IIRC, allows only defining one key server and
many people still use SKS key servers.

I think it does not matter.
Professional businesses and their customers can use the mentioned Mailvelope key server,
to protect their keys or use for anonymity purposes Hagrid, in combination with sequoia
pgp, while the geeks can use WKD.
The only thing SKS, so it seems, is currently good for is decentralized file sharing or
for chat purposes, when using SKS chat software.

Well, there is IMHO a good replacement for SKS available, called
hockeypuck and it is written in modern Golang.
The problem is that those (I don't know what to call these people
publicity) SKS key server operators have no plan.
The hockeypuck author is really fast in responding when it comes
to issues and I guess he would be quite happy to help the SKS operators
with solving issues, or listen to users if they have proposals.
The good thing about the modern programming language Golang is that
*soooooo* many (young) people are using Golang nowadays, that
it should be easy to assist the author of hockeypuck.

@_subject: Which keyserver 
*With all due respect*, the problems you mention with the SKS protocol is IMHO absolutely solvable with hockeypuck if the author
implements the same Mailvelope or Hagrid confirmation process for its users, or it would honor the SKS --no-modify flag, Werner
implemented long time ago in GnuPG. And if (former) SKS key server operators would be honest this could be solved with
hockeypuck and if not people which are using GnuPG or OpenPGP apps may wondering how it comes that a client/server model for
*security/privacy* software is from the SKS server side globally still operated, if it can not *protect* their users pub keys
I am very sorry to say that but all arguments from former or current SKS operators do not convince me nor do they show the
OpenPGP users community willingness or advancements in this area, to be taken serious.
Best regards

I am not interested to discuss old SKS issues/proposals further on the SKS mailing list
with (former) SKS operators and only wanted to bring my POV to GnuPG users attention.
I am aware of dkg's fine draft and his other valuable contributions he made.
I stand by my points that hockeypuck can solve the issues and will respect your
wish to not further discuss technical SKS issues here on the GnuPG Mailing List.
In case dkg is reading this thread, maybe he, as highly respected community member and
skilled programmer, can discuss these things with the hockeypuck author on GitHub, in
case he has time and is willing to do so.
