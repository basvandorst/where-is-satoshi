Hash: SHA1
Only the owner of the secret key can decrypt a message once it has been
encoded for that key. In short, the answer is "no."
The same as signing anything else in life: the prove that you really sent
something, or wrote something.
You assign trust based on how much you trust the owner of the key to
authenticate other keys.

@_subject: Waiting for lock? 
I got the following error when piping a message from pine to gpg. It
basically kept repeating forever, until I hit CTRL-C. This happens EVERY
time. Can anyone tell me what it means, and how to fix it?
gpg: waiting for lock (hold by 2950 - probably dead) ...

@_subject: Decrypt to stdout (no files) 
Is it possible to decrypt a message to stdout, without gpg writing output
files to the hard disk? I'd like to keep a small password database
encrypted, and don't want to leave traces all over the filesystem every
time I want to look up a password.

@_subject: GnuPG Manual and Digital Signatures 
Typically, a digital signature has a long lifetime, e.g., forever,
    and you also do not want to lose the signatures on your key that you
    worked hard to collect. On the other hand, the encryption subkey may
    be changed periodically for extra security, since if an encryption
    key is broken, the attacker can read all documents encrypted to that
    key both in the future and from the past.
there is no security implication in someone cracking the master key
because it is only used to sign, and not to encrypt.
To my way of thinking, though, the fact that someone might be able to
forge my signature is at least as big a problem as allowing them to
intercept messages with a compromised subkey.
Have I misunderstood the manual on this point? Am I wrong in thinking that
a signing key which never expires represents a danger?

Yes, although if you plan to use scp, I'd question whether you need to
encrypt the files with gpg first. It certainly won't hurt to have a second
layer of encryption, but if all you're trying to do is prevent third-party
interception, ssh itself is pretty secure.

@_subject: signing key lifetime 
No one has answered this question yet, so I'm going to ask it again in a
slightly different way. What is the basis for the GnuPG manual's claim
that the effective lifetime of a signing key is infinite, while the
effective lifetime of an encryption key is limited?

@_subject: signing key lifetime 
There's a big difference between a brute-force attack on a given session
key, and factoring the private key from the public key. Without factoring
the key, cracking one message should not make it any easier to crack
future messages.
Your answer also seems to perpetuate the idea that forged authentication
is somehow less dangerous than a cracked message. If you are using a DSA
signature to guarantee that a message/key/file has been properly
authenticated, then a successfully forged signature is perhaps even more
dangerous, because it breaks the web of trust.
The GnuPG documentation implies that the signing key is less vulnerable to
attack. But if the encryption key is vulnerable to brute-force attack,
what makes the signing key any less vulnerable?

That makes sense, and I agree with it. But the manual presents it as
somehow having a longer cryptographically-secure useful lifetime. If
there's no evidence that the signing key is somehow less vulnerable to
attack, I just think the manual ought to be clearer about the useful
lifetime of the master signing key.

@_subject: Primary uid not honored in 1.4.9 
I've attempted (several times, in fact) to create a key pair with three
UIDs: one primary and two others. Whether using Seahorse or the command
line, I will manually set one of the UIDs as primary.
This *appears* to work locally, but if I export the keypair and then
import it into another gnupg keyring on a different box (still running
1.4.9, though) the primary UID defaults to whichever UID was created
last rather than the one selected as primary.
While I know that different implementations of PGP aren't required to
honor the primary UID, shouldn't gnupg honor its own? Why isn't the
primary UID being exported, and what can I do about it?
