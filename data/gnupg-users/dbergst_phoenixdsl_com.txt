Can anyone comment on this recent security advisory, and whether any of RedHat's patches have been submitted to the gnupg cvs?

Maybe it should send it gnupg encrypted with our public keys!  :-)

there's still no way to turn this off in mailman?  (I last asked a few years

I've put a line in my .gnupg/options telling it:
...but most of the time, if I open a signed message, it doesn't work.
I get:
gpg: Signature made Fri Feb  2 20:06:14 2001 EST using DSA key ID 24B44202
gpg: requesting key 24B44202 from search.keyserver.net ...
gpg: [fd 7]: read error: Connection reset by peer
gpg: Total number processed: 0
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
(Apologies to the owner of the key ID I'm using in that example.)
I've seen it work once, so I'm not sure what the error is.  Anyone have a
bright idea?

Hash: SHA1
Dear Karol,
I like your program for its UI enhancements to GnuPG, but some
features that are in the WinPT development version (0.1.2pre)
appear to work a bit better, e.g., clipboard verify (GPG window
disappears too quickly to read from gnupgshell).  Right now I am
running both frontends together to leverage the best parts of
both programs, which does not seem to cause any conflicts.
Have you considered collaborating with WinPT's author on a
unified Windows front end to GnuPG?
Best regards,
David R. Bergstein

I agree - unfortunately, I do not have another Red Hat Linux available to
compile the code, and
upload to this machine.
I tried to access the RPM system, but do not have permission to run it.
Do you know of a compiled GnuPG for an i386 Red Hat Linux system?
Thanks for all the time and the suggestions made by all - Although I hate
giving up on a system,
I agree that this one is just too unreasonable, and I will just be wasting
time trying to fit a
GnuPG compile into it.

@_subject: No more encryption? 
I recently upgraded to KDE 2.1 but have not yet tested the GnuPG integration
for kmail since I recently expired my key.  I will do a simple test and post
the results for encrypting and signing emails from there sometime today.

I recently did an install on kde2.1 after crashing my linux system (eDesktop
2.4).  I had kde2.1 before the crash, but I had to reinstall everything
except my user directories.  Now the encryption does nothing.  It asks for
passphrase, but does no encryption nor signatures. Any ideas what can be
