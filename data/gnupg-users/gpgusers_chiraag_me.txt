@_subject: Clearing cached PIN for Yubikey 
I was attempting to figure out what the 'canonical' way of clearing a Yubikey's cached PIN is. I adjusted the default-cache-ttl and max-cache-ttl values in gpg-agent.conf to no effect. I also attempted to use card-timeout (even though it was clear from searching around that it was probably useless).
I know there's a setting to force (or not force) entering a PIN for signing in gpg --edit-card, but there doesn't seem to be a corresponding option for forcing a PIN for decryption.
Obviously I can just yank out my Yubikey or restart the agent (systemctl --user restart gpg-agent) and get the desired effect (although echo RELOADAGENT | gpg-connect-agent *doesn't* achieve the same thing...), but I'd like to find another option if available.
Here is the output of gpg --version:

Is it possible to link the original source material (Snowden's speech or interview or whatever) rather than this video which could, for example, be a montage of several different speeches or interviews?

Isn't the NSO group Israeli, not Russian as claimed in the video?

I was wary of storing my private GPG keys on my phone (if only because of theft/loss/etc), so I set up my keys on a Yubikey and use that to decrypt stuff on my phone. From what I understand, even if they were to obtain secrets decrypted by the Yubikey or exfiltrate private files, they would not be able to actually decrypt them given that the key resides on the Yubikey (if the private key were on the phone itself, they'd "just" have to crack the passphrase or whatever, which would presumably be much easier...).
Just another way to mitigate the risk of stuff like this.

Hi Dmitry,
I created a tutorial a while back on my website for setting this stuff up: Let me know if you have questions or if anything's unclear!

I mean, don't you think it's odd that you can't find a single other source for those statements coming from Snowden? And don't you find it odd that Pegasus is claimed to be a Russian group, when in fact they're Israeli (showing a basic lack of care regarding factual statements that are easily verified or debunked)? I don't think Snowden would make that sort of mistake, and I would think we'd see a lot more articles or videos or whatever about this.
Is Pegasus dangerous? Absolutely. Do I take the claims in the video at face value? Not really, no. And I doubt that Snowden actually said all of those things as one coherent statement (although they might be various statements taken from various different interviews or speeches or whatever).
The whole veracity of the video rests on Snowden's authority, and I suspect the people who made the video are banking on people trusting it because it seems to come from Snowden.

I suppose, you're right. I'm wary of blindly believing videos, especially when faking them has become relatively easy at this point.
I think one thing both Android and iOS get wrong is that the user isn't really in control of the device. So many manufacturer ROMs have built-in bloatware and various apps you'll never use, and there's no way to get rid of it. There are different classes of apps with differing levels of access to the internals of the OS, and there isn't much you can do about it. And on iOS, you're at the mercy of Apple as to whether your device remains supported and whether e.g. bugs in WebKit (the only renderer available on iOS) get fixed for your device. While custom ROMs solve some of these issues, most phones are bought with a locked bootloader (since most people aren't rich enough to buy their smartphones outright and end up leasing them through the service provider), which sort of renders that argument moot for *most* people.
Fundamentally, while a Linux phone may not necessarily have all of the hardening or whatever that many Android phones come with today, I'd argue that the privacy aspects, and the fact that the user truly _owns_ their device, more than make up for those (current) deficiencies. It will be easier, I think, to defend against what you're talking about in terms of malware, shady links, and so on because you have the opportunity to control literally *everything* running on your device.
Once I get my PinePhone, one of the first things I will be doing is playing around with things like firejail to see if I can get seamless sandboxing for most programs (I already heavily utilize firejail on my laptop). And I suspect that level of control (and ability to keep receiving updates, no matter how old the phone) will put Linux phones over the top in terms of security.

Yubikey dealt with a mass recall only last year due to a bug in their firmware:

You'll have to install python3-qrencode, not qrencode. All of the dependencies should by in the form of python3- (or if that's not available, install it through pip3).
Hope that helps!

Additionally, you can install paperkey from the Debian repos, which might do something similar?
