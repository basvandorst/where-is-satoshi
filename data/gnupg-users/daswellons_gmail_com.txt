@_subject: preferred compression types with multiple recipients 
Good day everyone,
How does gpg reconcile conflicting preferred compression types?  I've switched mine to bzip2 to save space, but it occurs to me that it may not be of much effect until a significant number of other people I communicate with also switch from zlib.
My understanding of encrypted mail to multiple recipients is that
public key.
It seems that a message is only compressed once.
