@_subject: Fwd: gnupg SmartCard V3.3 
i bought two V3.3 cards, but can`t get them to work ?
the keytocard command does not move the key but copy it and further on the gpg2 --card-status -> fetch followed by gpg2 --card-status does not create the stub keys, so gpg2 --list-secret-keys does not show any keys ...
I have the same (rsa4096) sub-key loaded to each slot 1,2,3 eg SEA and card-status does show them ? gpg2 --version is 2.1.11
I did further tests by calling gpg2 ?card-edit -> generate with keylength 2048 and 4096 which fail with ?card-error? Tried gpg (GnuPG/MacGPG2) 2.2.3
on a completely different machine (mac)
Tried the other card (i bought two with consecutive serial numbers)
Tried three different card-reader:
- Cherry GmbH SmartBoard XX44
-  KOBIL EMV CAP - SecOVID Reader III
- Alcor Micro AU9540 00 00
Can anybody help?
Kind Regards,

@_subject: gnupg SmartCard V3.3 
This is my target device because it is build-in in our Laptops,
i found this ct 2017-10 (german computer magazine) Article,
where they claim the reader to be working with the openpgp smartcard Version 2.1 by transfering precreated 4096-Bit keys. This is exactly what i am tring to do - and it seems to work, only the stub keys are not being generated?
So either i am doing something stupid or the V3.3 card incorporated changes which broke this.
I ordered another reader and asked if it would be possible do buy some 2.1 cards for cross-tersting, but it seems they would have to be manufactured as they are out of stock.
Can anybody suggest how i could further debug the --card-edit and --card-status to find out why the stubs are not being generated?
Kind Regards,
 Klaus

Thank you all for the support!
The mail about needing support for the V3.3 cards in opensc pointed me in the right direction.
I relied on the information that the V3.3 is backwards compatible to the V2.1
but this does not seem to be the case.
Compiling a fresh gpg 2.2.5  with --enable-ccid-driver from source did the trick for the linux machines.

@_subject: efail is imho only a html rendering bug 
Internet works because we have standards.
Rfc 3986 states that URLs have to be ecoded.
Redering-Engies which send unencodes content including whitespaces and newlines to an external Server are seriously broken.
(Only to point the finger at the real bug)
Kind Regards,
