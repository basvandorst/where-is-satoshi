@_subject: Need a command to suppress 
Add "'" | grep -v "Signature made" | grep -v "Good signature" "'" to the
end of the command. Using "grep -v" inverts the match so only lines
that do *not* contain the matching text are passed to stdout.
Of course that's no help for Windows, but...

I think you missed the meaning of suppress and/or invert. Might be a
language issue. Don't trust me. Test it on some text with a known good signature and
fix the targets if you get any unwanted matches.

No. Can't be done. Not possible. By design.

@_subject: Where to find message processing how-to's 
I'm developing wrapper scripts to provide OpenPGP-based authentication
and transport layer encryption for email applications like mailing lists
and play by email game servers. A lot of the functionality of these
scripts will be provided by making system calls to gpg commands as the
scripting language is very much specialized for parsing and filtering
In addition to "info gpg" and RFC 3156, are there any other resources
that would be useful for parsing, decrypting and/or verifying inbound
mail? Docs oriented towards Linux shell scripting would be ideal, but I
understand why these are scarce.

@_subject: Signing all outgoing mails on MTA, not on MUA 
You may want to ask legal how they feel about adding nonrepudiation
automatically to every message.
If you had a system where you could make a meaningful assertion about
the identity of a mail originator and you could secure a key without
using a passphrase then you might use OpenPGP to make that assertion
by operating GnuPG in batch mode. It's much more likely, however, that
the type of identity you wish to assert is not compatible with the
OpenPGP model and that the security infrastucture is inadequate to make
that assertion meaningfully. Think, for example, about key signing. Who
would be qualified to verify that the key is connected with the
identity in any meaningful way?
The corporate value of public key cryptography is much more readily
attained using DKIM. Milter setup and key management for signing DKIM
mail is pretty straight forward. You place your key in Text records in
DNS. That establishes a meaningful connection between the identity
of the sender (or at least ownership of the mail server) and the owner
of the domain. Setting up DKIM with Postfix was at least as easy as
setting up GPG with Claws and it makes an identity assertion that is
appropriate for a server environment.

@_subject: Can't enter passphrase in su session. 
In .bash_profile, you will have something *like* this:
if test -f $HOME/.gpg-agent-info &&    kill -0 `cut -d: -f 2 $HOME/.gpg-agent-info`\
2>/dev/null; then
     GPG_AGENT_INFO=`cat $HOME/.gpg-agent-info`
     export GPG_AGENT_INFO
     eval `/usr/bin/gpg-agent --daemon`
     echo $GPG_AGENT_INFO >$HOME/.gpg-agent-info
You *may* have something like this:
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
        . /etc/bashrc
The code to launch gpg-agent needs to be in .bashrc if you want it to
execute for su users. If your .bash_profile executes your .bashrc as
above then you can remove the definition from .bash_profile.
