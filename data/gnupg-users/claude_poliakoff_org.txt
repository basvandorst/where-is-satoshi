@_subject: initial GnuPG install? 
Your posted instructions were quite clear. I checked for prior instances of gpg.exe and found none. downloaded and installed the Windows XP binary, tried entering gpg.exe in a DOS cmd window, and command not recognized, so off to Control Panel>System>advanced tab & added    ;C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG    with no improvement. So checked again for instance of gpg.exe in search of entire system, again finding no instance thereof. Help appreciated as I am very intrigued by the prospect of pluggin in OpenPGP for both authentication and encryption.
Thanks in advance.
