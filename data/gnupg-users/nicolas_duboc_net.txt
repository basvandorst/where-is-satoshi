Hi all,
 Is there a way to examine a key available in a file without importing
it in a keyring ?
 I would like to see what exactly is in the armored key I exported from
my keyring.
 Thanks in advance.

Thanks.
   It was exactly what I was looking for.
   Hum, it seems that this feature is not documented in the gpg man page
(at least the one provided by Debian).
