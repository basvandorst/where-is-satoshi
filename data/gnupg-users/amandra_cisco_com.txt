@_subject: problem in Installing GNUPGP version 1.0.1 
Hi  ,
I am installing GNUpg version 1.0.1 on a HPUX 10.20 system.
and i am having probs for compilation.
I have tried all the options given in INSTALL file eg.
./configure   (--enable-static-rnd= ???? ; --with included-zlib ;-- with
included gettext )
                   and so on...
The configure is successfull .How ever the compilation gets stuck at
collect2:ld returned 1 exit status
 _udiv_qrnnd  (code)
**** Error eexit code 1
Stop any ideas  on this..
Please send me a cc to amandra as I am not a member of
gnupg-users ..please treat this as urgent..
Thanks in advance
