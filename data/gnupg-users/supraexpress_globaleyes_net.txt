@_subject: GnuPG ?Bineries? to USE PnuPG with Windows? 
You can also, and preferably, get GnuPG Windows binaries from
" which always has the most current version whereas other
distributions oftentimes do not.

Gnome2 text editor (gedit) gets a GnuPG plugin from Seahorse (GnuPG GUI
interface application).

@_subject: dump/dd/tar + gpg > tape = file write error 
When attempting to back up a filesystem with GPG to encrypt the stream,
the result (so far) has always been:
gpg: /dev/sa0: write error: Invalid argument
gpg: iobuf_flush failed on close: file write error
no matter what method (dump, dd, tar, etc.) was used to create the "dump
stream". It appears to occur only at the end of the "dump stream".
Different options for dd (conv=notrunc conv=osync) don't make any
difference. Using the "--batch" option for GPG doesn't make any difference.
Is there a way to correct this (without creating any new files)?

Thanks for the suggestion. Your "pipeline assumption" was correct.
I have an Exabyte SCSI-3 tape drive which is faster than most DAT
drives, so it is worth it to see if I can get "encrypted backups" to
work easily enough. Next - I will be experimenting with encrypting
backups via ISO (CD images), and will probably need a similar pipeline.

@_subject: need example of passing clear text to gpg from another app without 
Gedit has a Text Encryption plugin to encrypt text provided from
Seahorse which is a front-end to GnuPG
from seahorse makefile:
  GEDIT "Enable GEdit plug-in support" on
(don't know if it uses a temporary file or not).
