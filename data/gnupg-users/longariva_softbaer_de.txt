I can not imagine Werner did really said this ;-) Werner, am I wrong?
In fact nobody knows if they really did. IBM proposed DES to NBS/NIST for
the requested Public Cipher Algorithm. NSA (at that time the Agency did not
publicly admit their own existence) checked the algorithm and changed the
S-Boxes. This was the only thing done by NSA (officially to assure IBM did
not put any trapdoor in DES - some people pointed to this as evidence NSA
put themselve a trapdoor in DES. But no cryptoanalysis did ever prove this
theory). Tuchman and Meyer, two of the cryptographers at IBM who designed
DES, said NSA did not alter the design: "NSA did not dictate a single wire"
