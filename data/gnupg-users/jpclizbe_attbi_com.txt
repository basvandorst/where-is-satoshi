Hash: SHA1
I'm puzzled about not using --prefix to 'keep the default directory
structure' since the default for --prefix is /usr/local. Those other
"default" directories would also require root access for installation.
Anyway FWIW,`./configure --help` gives the following info:
Installation directories:
  --prefix=PREFIX install architecture-independent files
         in PREFIX                         [/usr/local]
  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent
         files in EPREFIX                  [PREFIX]
By default, `make install' will install all the files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/lib' etc.  You can specify
an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' using `--prefix',
for instance `--prefix=$HOME'.
For better control, use the options below.
Fine tuning of the installation directories:
  --bindir=DIR           user executables [EPREFIX/bin]
  --sbindir=DIR          system admin executables [EPREFIX/sbin]
  --libexecdir=DIR       program executables [EPREFIX/libexec]
  --datadir=DIR          read-only architecture-independent data
  --sysconfdir=DIR       read-only single-machine data [PREFIX/etc]
  --sharedstatedir=DIR   modifiable architecture-independent data
  --localstatedir=DIR    modifiable single-machine data [PREFIX/var]
  --libdir=DIR           object code libraries [EPREFIX/lib]
  --includedir=DIR       C header files [PREFIX/include]
  --oldincludedir=DIR    C header files for non-gcc [/usr/include]
  --infodir=DIR          info documentation [PREFIX/info]
  --mandir=DIR           man documentation [PREFIX/man]
So, to only change the binary directory, specify --bindir= to the
configure script, ie" `./configure --bindir=$HOME/bin`.
Then the usual make commands.....

The "[]" construct in the Subject header is used for a lot of

You need your keyring files (pubring.gpg, secring.gpg), trustdb.gpg and,
more than likely, your gpg.conf files. Copy them from from one machine's
gpg home directory and restore to the second machine's.
This should work fairly transparently moving between like OS.
The actual mechanics of doing this would vary depending on your use of
media: Floppy, ZIP disk, LS-120 disk, USB stick, network connection,

@_subject: Email Clients and digital signatures 
Hash: SHA1
I don't think Emory was arguing that the design/architecture of a Linux
worksatiion was no more secure than that of DOS, but that the *use* of
one, in the hands of an inexperienced user, often is. Usually, for the
exact reason Joseph mentioned, they login and run as root. They also tend
to over-install and run network services which would be better left disabled.
Different security designs because of OS heritages - DOS on signle-user
PCs; Unix evolving on networked shared timeshare systems. Unix/Linux
systems make the assumption that one knows what he is doing. That is their
heritage. Windows approaches from the philosophy of making computers
 "easy to use". Microsloth wants you to eXPerienthhh your
computer (I want to *beat* the marketing-droids that created THAT
I agree that not running OE/Outlook (LookOut?) is a positive step. I think
I once saw Outlook described as "A huge security hole with a small e-mail
client attached". But I disagree that one must switch to Linux to get a
safe(r) email client. Clients exist for WIN32 that avoid all, if not most,
of the problems stemming from MSFT's tight coupling of client and OS:
Mozilla/Phoenix, Beonex, Pegasus, Eudora, Becky, The Bat!,... Some of
these like Mozilla and Phoenix make encrytion/signing relatively easy with
the Enigmail addon for GnuPG. Eudora supports a PGP plugin.
When Evangelizing users away from OE/Outlook, one needs to remember that
all users are not as techno-savvy as many on this list. To win converts a
product needs to be easy to install and configure, relatively simple to
use, and provide a high degree of interoperability and functionality. As
the original poster asked, "Can this be implemented ... easily without
having to read tons of HOWTO documents?" The answer sadly is still "Maybe".
I got my partner to make the move from IE/Outlook to Mozilla simply by
showing how things HE wanted to do were easier/possible using, in this
case, Netscape.  But not everyone is "blessed" with a live-in tech support

Hash: SHA1
finger's main problem is that it makes it easy for intruders to get a list
of users on your system, which can dramatically increase the intruder's
chances of breaking into your system. One would also scrub the files
finger prints of any personal information not wanted to be disclosed.
Finger's claim to infamy was one line of code exploited by Robert Morris
in 1988's Internet Worm episode. It was a buffer overflow that caused
fingerd to execute a shell.
If you are running finger of this vintage, you probably have many more
severe problems to worry about .

WOOO HOOOOO !
No problems building any of the earlier releases other than getting
working LDAP/SASL/BerkDB libs built under MinGW/MSys on Win2000. (A LOT of
work for one binary 8-{)). )
Been using Yaron's SKS server keyserver.bu.edu
Thank you for the great work.  I'm using Carlo Bianco's technique
for building GnuPG on Win32 using MinGW & MSys. Everything builds except
gpgkeys_ldap, but I guess I'll have to get around to tickling OpenLDAP
into building. The only changes I had to make was to add libwsock32.a to
the linking in a few places -- adding $(NETLIBS) to a few _LDADDs.
    gpg_LDADD =  mkdtemp$U.o $(LDADD)   $(NETLIBS)
    gpgv_LDADD = $(LDADD) $(NETLIBS)
    mpicalc_LDADD = $(needed_libs)  $(NETLIBS)
    bftest_LDADD = $(needed_libs)   $(NETLIBS)
gpg_LDADD was really a stylistic change from -lwsock32 to $(NETLIBS).
gpg works fine in a Windows CMD window, but this is the first version I've
built that doesn't run under MinGW32's /bin/sh. This showed up in "make
check". Running gpg results in the error:
    The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000022).

For the time being, a Win32 user could install either the canonical or

encrypt/decrypt/sign/verify using the clipboard and "current window"

nonportable -- you're tied to your main PC -- unless that's a laptop

The trouble is the spaces in the file/path names. A few ideas from my
own battle scars using unix/Gnu/OpenSource stuff in a Win32 world:
1) Put entire filename and path in quotes - "C:\Documents and
Settings\Person Here\My Documents\Visual Studio
2) use 'old-style (8.3)' file and folder names -
3) If not already using it, try the Nullify build of GnuPG
4) I agree using the root dir is a 'not good' hack. What about using
5) Unix-fy the path - ie replace '\' with '/' and escape the spaces
with '\' -  "C:/Documents\ and\ Settings/Person\ Here/My\
Documents/Visual\ Studio\ Projects/WindowsApplication2/bin/Debug/file.txt"
Though I think this only works under Cygwin, MinGW32, or Services for
Unix's Interix environments and quotes around the name would be easier.

GPGshell is closest in functionality to PGP. You DID look a the PGP
