@_subject: GnuPG under BSDI v3.1 
Our organization is looking into using GnuPG as a PGP replacement (it's
open source for one...)  And since we are slowly moving to a FreeBSD
environment, it should be an easy implementation.  However, we do have some
BSDI v3.1/v4.x workstations used by on and off-site colleagues, and it
would be an added bonus if GnuPG would work there as well (It does work on
the other major *BSD's - Free/Net/Open).
Has anyone had any success in compiling GnuPG on BSDI?
FWIW, this is what I get on a BSDI v3.1 box:
