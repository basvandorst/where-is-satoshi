sounds good! Do you have all public keys of the subscribers in the
servers keyring ?  And do the posters have to encrypt the message
with server's public-key ? I would be really interested to look at your scripts, if possible :
I'm willing to setup exactely the same kind of list on my server.
Thanks in advance!
