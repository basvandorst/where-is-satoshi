@_subject: GPG in a chroot env 
Afternoon all,
Just a quick kind of general question to start with here....
How well does GPG handle being "confined" in a chroot environment in a
shared webhosting platform?  I am one of the programmers/designers for the
webhosting packages and one of my projects is to offer customers the ability
to use gpg for e-commerce type applications (to encrypt the order info in
the email).  I need to know if it is worth the time to get it up and running
or try to evaluate another option.

Has no one done this before?  Or does it just not work?

@_subject: GPG and Shared Memory 
I have looked in a couple of places and have not seem any mention if GPG
uses shared memory.  If it does use it what is the best way to workaround

@_subject: Compile problems on Solaris 2.7 
Hello All,
I was trying to put GnuPG into a production environment this morning
(already tested on my linux machine locally) but I ran into problems while
running make.  Below is some information that I captured.  If anyone has
some tips or suggestions, please let me know.
