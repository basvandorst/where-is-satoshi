@_subject: Different size output on same input with Twofish? 
Hi, I may open my mouth too early as I am not very knowledgeable in the area,
but isn't there a time stamp with every signature (meaning the time when it was
encrypted) ?
If so, that would :
1/ change the data
2/ hence change the encryption and compression you can get out of it (you're
using gzip -9)
Best regards,
