@_subject: How gpg handle windows folder which is seperated by space 
Hi there,
I have gnupg installed on a windows 2000 system.  It works fine until I
change my homedir to c:\program files\...  It could not handle folder name
containing space.  Is there anyway I could work around?

I tried with quotes ("") as
Still gives error as
"file open error
gpgv: can't open 'test\aaa'
gpgv: verify signatures failed: file open error"

Yes, use quotes ("") around the directory name and curse the person at MS
who thougt it to be a good idea to use spaces in often-used directory names.

@_subject: GnuPG with Java waitFor() method on Windows? 
I am trying to use java Runtime.getRuntime().exec() to call gnupg to decrypt
encrypted file.  However, even though the file is properly decrypted,
waitFor() never returns.  The problem does not occur while I tried to verify
a signed data file.  By the way, is Java SDK1.4 Gnupg compatible?

Here is my code, quite simple:
import java.io.*;
public class LicenseXmlTest class TestXml sss.asc ";
output_para + license_file + decrypt_para + infile;

Thank you for the input.
Using System.out.println(cmd), I could see my dos command, and if I copy
that command directly in a dos prompt, there is no problem.
I added --batch and --no-tty and --yes options, but still the same thing.
The file is decrypted and saved in the proper folder but waitFor() still
does not return.  No error, no exception.

It might be waiting for some input from your program. Add the --batch and --no-tty options to make sure that it doesn't prompt you for something. Does the secret key have a passphrase? If so, that's what it's waiting for.

@_subject: gpgv: checks the timestamps of the key 
Hi there,
I have a question about how the gpgv command validate the timestamp of the
key and the signature.  As stated by the manpage "GnuPG normally checks that
the timestamps associated with keys and signatures have plausible values."
I have public key saved on my machine, and every time when verify a
signature, the program copies the key to be trustedkeys.pgp.  After
validation, trustedkeys.pgp is removed.  It works fine until one day I
changed my PC time back to some time in year of 2000, then the validation
failed saying the key is generated in the future time.  It still recognized
that the signature is generated sometime in year 2003.  How gpgv detect the
timestamp of the key then?  My situation may be weird, but I am curious for
the reason.
