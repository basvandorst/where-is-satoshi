@_subject: GnuPG (GPGME) & Sylpheed ? 
hi all,
in my search for the perfect Linux mailer - which is quite hard, after using TheBat! in mickeysoft's OS :) - i'm having a look at Sylpheed. i compiled it with GPGME and did some tests with my own accounts ; it seems to work well, but it doesn't check (or show) the signatures in this mailing list ?! anybody else here using this combo who can give me a hint ??
