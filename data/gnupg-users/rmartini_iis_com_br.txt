@_subject: List packets flag 
Hi all!
The flag '--list-packets' ist powerful tool, especially after the Senderek's
 research... Then, anybody knows a GnuPG's specific "tutorial" or general informations
 about this feature?

@_subject: Policy URL 
I found  at the gpg an original flag "--set-policy-url". What's this? Well, I can understand this option literally... But, the RFC 2440 tell us about this:
"5.2.3.19. Policy URL
This subpacket contains a URL of a document that describes the policy
that the signature was issued under."
Someone wrote or knows a simple example of this document? The "Policy" above decribed means
the limitation or validity of the signature?
