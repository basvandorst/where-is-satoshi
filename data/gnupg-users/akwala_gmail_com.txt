Symptom: In Ubuntu 13.10, 'apt-get update' has started showing several
warnings like the following, even though the keys are present:
W: GPG error:  saucy Release: The following
signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available:
NO_PUBKEY 40976EAF437D05B5 NO_PUBKEY 3B4FE6ACC0B21F32
'apt-key list' begins with the following:
gpg: keyblock resource
`/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d//webupd8team-y-ppa-manager.gpg': resource limit

this that I could find was from 2002, when gnupg went from 1.0.6 to
What does the "resource limit" message mean? Should I run 'gpg
--rebuild-keydb-caches' as suggested in the GnuPG 1.0.7 release

Good that Google has released the source. Hope to see the implementation
compared to OpenPGP.js.
