@_subject: Compiling GnuPG 1.4.5 for Windows on Windows 
Then Assuming I'm correct...
using SVN files
The change would take place in the g10/mainproc.c
because in the SVN files there is no gnupg.pot file
g10/mainproc.c:1681 g10/mainproc.c:1729
msgid "Good signature from \"%s\""
msgstr ""
because in the SVN files there is no gnupg.pot file
I can only guess that there would be some translation problems
should I try to compile a version other than "en"
would this be correct?
