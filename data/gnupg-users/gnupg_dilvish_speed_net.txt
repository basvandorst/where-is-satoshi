Gotta love a mailing list devoted to email security that sends your password
to you in cleartext once a month whether you like it or not.  I assume
there's still no way to turn this off in mailman?  (I last asked a few years

@_subject: [Announce] Mailman passwords 
It wouldn't bother me too much if the passwords were only sent on request.
It's the forced monthly reminders that seem gratuitous and very poor
Most mailing list software mails you a unique generated cookie only when you
ask to be unsubscribed, and then you have to send that back.  So the
attackers has to be a current MITM.  With these passwords an attacker can
grab it once (whether from disk, network sniffing, or whatever) and use it
to mess with you in the future.
Even if that were a reasonable default (which I don't think it is), that's
not a reason they couldn't have more secure and more complicated systems
turned on as an option.

You're splitting hairs.  It's devoted to email security (among other things).
I don't think the challenge/response type of unsubscribing is any more
frustrating, and it's certainly more secure.
Yes, but there's no reason for them to be less secure than necessary.  I
won't bother to list them, but there are certainly scenarios where someone
getting your gnupg-{announce,users} passwords could have bad consequences.

@_subject: Why is ~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg readable by all? 
Your question is still a good one, but I'd just point out that the default
permissions on ~/.gnupg are rwx------, are they not?  So the permissions on
trustdb.gpg won't matter *too* much...

If I'm not mistaken, that means the group of files created in that directory
will be set to the group of the directory itself, assuming you are a member
of that group (the bit is only meaningful if you are a member of multiple
groups).  Not sure why your ~/.gnupg got set up that way, though.

Hello.  Has anyone successfully installed GnuPG 1.0.4 (plus security patch)
on AIX 4.3.3?
I'm using gcc 2.95.2, no GNU binutils, and GNU make 3.79.1.  I configured
    % env CFLAGS="-g -O2 -mcpu=powerpc" configure --enable-static-rnd=egd\
     --with-egd-socket=/usr/local/etc/egd/entropy
My make worked fine until this point:
    gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I../include -I../intl    -g -O2\
     -mcpu=powerpc -Wall -DIS_MODULE -shared  -o rndlinux ./rndlinux.c
    ./rndlinux.c: In function `gather_random':
    ./rndlinux.c:131: warning: implicit declaration of function `bzero'
    ./rndlinux.c:144: warning: int format, long int arg (arg 3)

    make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/gnupg-1.0.4'
    make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2
Shouldn't a .o compiled from util/logger.c be included on the link line to
avoid this?  Should it even be trying to build rndlinux on AIX?
(I am now subscribed to the list, so no need to cc me when you reply.
Thanks in advance.)
