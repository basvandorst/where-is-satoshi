The actual error is:
gpg: encrypted with ELG-E key, ID BEA2D168
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
It appears that another key being added was not the only thing that occurred and someone has deleted the secret key the message was encrypted to. Do you have a backup to re-import?

I figured is was Unix. Without a backup you wont be able to decrypt the file.
Are you certain there is no backup? No backup of the system which could have the .gnupg directory? Tape perhaps?

yes if you have the key on another server such as a production box.
gpg --export-secret-key -a > a-filename-here
copy it to the dev box with something like scp
then on the dev box
gpg --import a-filename-here
make sure to remove the file you generated exporting the key. You don't want someone to see copy it ;)
shred -f -n 1000 -z -v -u a-filename-here

Can you provide the output of --list-sigs ?
That doesn't look like it has been signed or perhaps you didn't issue
save afterward?

Is the key you signed this with the 0x359B3EB2 one? If so, is this one
marked as trusted in your keyring?

Have you verified it is trusted on the system you are trying to use it
 on? Perhaps the key isn't trusted.

This seems like something that would get really annoying really
quickly. Why not just change settings to not cache the passphrase if
you do not like using it this way ?

MITM is not hypothetical and has been used quite a bit with SSL based
systems. There are even companies who have entire product lines geared
towards LE / Intel org's that perform SSL MITM attacks for intelligence
gathering and such.

Are you just trying to update virtualbox or Fedora in general ?
If Fedora, have you verified that the GPG key's for that release are
You might want to reference If it is just that one RPM you are trying to update and the key is
failing I would suggest contacting the packager of Virtualbox or making
an inquiry on the Fedora Users Mailing list which you can join at
