@_subject: Heartbleed attack on Openssl 
Dear GNUPG community,
I think a lot of unexperienced users would like to know more about the
Heartbleed problem found on some of the openssl versions. I have two broad
questions and two specific questions:
1) Which type of clients have been compromised (consider an ordinary user)?
2) Which common applications use openssl and are a potential target?
2) Are firefox users compromised?
3) Are RetroShare users compromised?
Thanks in advance.

So going back to the original question as I can see there is no
disagreement on its importance:
*1) What are the consequences to the ordinary user? *
All the news are lacking information on that. Can you point relevant
All I could gather is that the only major/well known server to be
compromised was Yahoo.
For example: Gmail and Dropbox and Hotmail seem to be imune to this. I also
found out that Mozilla/Firefox browser were also imune. If I would persuade
someone of this bug's importance, which other examples could I give?
2) (specific question) Does Firefox use openssl to connect to some servers
while browsing?
3) How about Ubuntu and other OSs? Do they use openssl to update
themselves? (as in "apt-get update && apt-get upgrade").
Be as clear and basic as possible. In the context of "It's 2014. Are we
there yet?" thread, I would like more shocking/tangible examples to suggest
friends to start thinking of cryptography (and then we are back to gnupg).
Thanks again.

Thanks everyone for the quick and complete feedback. New questions arose:
1) Firefox uses NSS instead of OpenSSL. Still it can communicate with a
OpenSSL based server (say X) and thus the browser's type is irrelevant. The
communication between browser and X could be eavesdropped. Is that correct?
2) If the first answer is yes, only the X service credentials/data could be
stolen or does that compromis the whole browser session (e.g.:
communication browser - service Y and browser - service Z)?

Dear Paulo,
I cannot help you on the technical part of your question but I do recommend that you should migrate to a fully
free OS. You have a list here:
I started using parabola 3 months ago (migrated from lubuntu) and I'm totally happy with it.
I hope that helps!

Dear Nico,
I think you are trying to achieve a compromise that is not possible. If I understood correctly
you are trying to reconcile developers interest with layman's enthusiasm. I myself belong to
the second group.
A good idea would be to organize one event for the developers and another open event so
everyone can join. Then I think everybody would be happy. Note that some overlap between groups
is expected and healthy for the community.
Kind regards,

Is there a way to comment a key locally?
Let's say I met a guy and we exchanged keys. After 10 years I decide to
send him an encrypted email. How would I remember the guy - key link?
I'm thinking of adding an alias like 'red haired funny tall guy from XYZ
Other scenario: I downloaded and verified a file on the internet. For
some reasons I decide to trust that his key belong to this developer.
I will not be using his key for some time. So again when I decide to
download again that software how can I remember that GOOD SIGNAURE from
abc at def is from the same developer?

@_subject: Fwd: tar, compress, split and then encrypt a list of files 
Dear mailing list,
right now I have a working workstream that gets paths from a text file and:
tar -> compress -> encrypt -> split (over each line/entry)
Probably there is a security issue here as some of the paths are dozens of
gigabytes in size.
I would like to swap the 'encrypt -> split' part but I'm unable to do so
using the GNU split functionality. Writing to disk then opening the split
files is a big performance hit.
Can I accomplish this in a single step?
(installing/using other tools is not a problem)
Best regards,
