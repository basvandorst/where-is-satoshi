@_subject: Mainkey with many subkeys?? 
I am a little bit confused about your key design ;)
Main key has options SC.
There is an active newer signing key S, so this will be always used for
And there are two active encryption keys E:
GPG uses in my opinion only the key generated latest, isn't it?
So how to desire which key is used?
And what's about backward compatibility?
Thanks for any hint, regards, Chris

@_subject: Mainkey with many subkeys?? 
Why has the mainkey SC if signing is not used? Are there some compatibility reasons?
I am working on some new keypairs with backwards compatibility, pls see this thread:
 Some corporate partners are still using older versions of Symantec's PGP with WinXP, mostly for intranet. Problems with signing keys are known, sometimes it works, sometimes not. It is very difficult to rate compatibility because Symantec's enterprise support (!) isn't be able to send me old PGP versions for testing.
Compatibility seems to be depending on order of subkey creation: If encryption key is latest, it is working.
If signing key is latest, mostly it is not working.
DSA signing keys are only accepted if max 2048 bit!?
If signing key is not the latest one and will be exchanged, it steps to last position => mostly not working.
And so on...
Best combination found so far:

signing with two keys in one block can be done. But also, if unequal technology used (e.g. RSA+edDSA)?

Hi Hugo,
I did make some test with your last post:
Outlook-incoming as Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"; Format="flowed"
If signing ?something? (your choice) and resending, signature is broken.
If signing ?something? and resending, signature is broken. (Word-2010; incoming Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8" Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable)
If signing "something" and resending, signature works as expected.
(Standard for Outlook-2010, Thunderbird-31.3; incoming Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit)
Most used common keyboards are using SHIFT+2 for quotation marks. This results in above shown results, depending on charset and program used. Your (German) keyboard seems to be a scientific one with some additional chars enabled:
 My Outlook-2010 (and Thunderbird too) generates "something" by default, not ?something? (your choice), or ?something?. Settings are set to "iso-8859-1", if new message is generated. If replying, incoming charset is used.
I didn't notice such a behavior before!? Regards, Chris

@_subject: Refreshing private key 
Hash: SHA256
is there is a need keeping old key id, you can generate new subkeys for A/S/E, keeping the old 2048bit certification key C only for offline signing.
Mainkey with old ID 2048bit
- - Subkey A 8096bit
- - Subkey S 8096bit (beware of this, long signature...)
- - Subkey E 8096bit
Old subkeys can be deactivated/revoked or not, GPG will use latest keys generated.
Generating keys > 4096bit can be done with GnuPG-Pack up to 50176bit (RSA) with some additional features:
Beware of compatibility with standard gpg installations!
Security advantage isn't as great as it seems to be...

Maybe implementation with an opt-in could preserve publishing of faked keys on public keyservers?
So if new key is uploaded an email with verification link is sent from keyserver to issuer.
If embedded link is verified by issuer in 10 Minutes => uploaded public key is published
If embedded link is NOT verified by issuer in 10 Minutes => uploaded public key is deleted
Forums are working with this technique since years.

Switch off!  ;)
Serious answer:
Latest known version of GPGrelay ist 0.962, extracted from Sebastian's GnuPG-Pack:
 Sourceforge provides the source code til version 0.959:
 There seems to be no further development since 2005/2006, isn't it?
In my opinion it would be very desirable if someone would adapt GPGrelay for interaction with new GPG-2.x key versions. And if touching source code, some minor issues with UTF-8 implementation could be fixed too.
Actual OpenSSL libraries (f.e. 1.0.2f) are running without any issue with GPGrelay too.
GPGrelay is the only known free proxy/relay program which allows different mail clients connecting with secured gpg encryption (Inline + PGP/Mime). Because of missing a fully functional solution for M$ Outlook it is needed further more...

Claws Mail is an useful alternative, but please keep aware it does not
support html mail, text only!

Thanks Werner.
After further investigation about html mailing with Claws Mail: 'Dillo HTML viewer' project has been updated Jun-2015, not available for
'litehtml' is available for Windows, but latest update is Oct-2015.
In our environment ~ 70% of contacts are using M$ Outlook and its
standard html mail functions, so discussion about sense of purpose are
mindless even a change of security awareness take place around there...
But you are right, html mail is definitely an annoyance and security
risk, but wide spreaded compatibility to several communication partners
and its needs is necessary!
Best regards, Chris
