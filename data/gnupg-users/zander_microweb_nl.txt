The random number generator on solaris is (according to the make check) not
strong, does this imply that I should not create a key, or also that I can not
sign my mail? (or both)

Hash: SHA1
I think this is not the place to ask this, but I could not find any other, so
forgive me for being off topic.
I recently installed gpg, and pgpgpg for the pgp interface so I could use elm.
Immidiately after opening an signed message i got the option that pgpgpg did not implement the     "keepbinary" option (which apparantly is a pgp option used by elm)
Can anyone tell me what this option does, and if gpg implements this? If gpg doesn't then why would pgpgpg die when the keepbinary option is passed, is it a security leak if this is not used or something.

@_subject: signed mail, and I don't have the public key.. 
I have been integrating gpg in my unix environment, using elm this meant installing the gpgpgp wrapper.
If I open an email which is signed, gpg tries to get the public key from the keyserver (I used  This action failed, probably because the
public key was not there.
After this, elm showed the output of gpg, this seemed to be an empty email! with a message that the signature could not be found.. This leaves me with the problem that I can not read signed messages, when I
don't have the public key. As I find this frustrating I wondered if anyone
has found a way to get past this.

Thanx, I set the 'default reader' to /full/path/gpg -d, which did the trick!
It really was that simple ;-)
by the way, retrieving the public key from the keyserver when needed, is
nothing short of a masterstroke!!

Hash: SHA1
I recently sent an email, and tried to read that myself. The email was signed
and I surprisingly got the following message:
gpg: Signature made Wed Jul 28 16:50:13 1999 MEST using DSA key ID 0A0588D5
gpg: Good signature from "Thomas Zander "
gpg: WARNING: Using untrusted key!
How can I not trust the key combined with my secret key?
I tried the edit-key, and set the trust to 4 (full), so what am I doning wrong?

You are right, the gpg command line works. Just as soon as I used it in elm I got that error. I looked at the commandline elm (and gpgpgp) produced and
it is as follows:
gpg --batch --always-trust --decrypt When I tried this on the command line I got the same problem, see above.
the option --always-trust was the one generating the above message.
Is it a bug? I am still using 0.9.8

Hi, my name is Thomas, and I am new to this list.
So allow me to start at the beginning of the software. I can't get it installed.
I did:
and in tools I got the error that the -lz arg for a gcc gave and error. Seeming I had nothing to loose, I removed the -lz from the Makefile ( in tools )
and everything worked fine.
This strategy didn't work in the g10 dir however.
Anyone care to help me out here?
I am working on Linux with Suse 6.0 and some 6.1
I am wondering what the --with-included-zlib does?
What is needed to install the software, specificly where can I find this 'z' lib.

What if all pages which are 'freed' are zero filled. I.e. when the memory is no longer needed and/or the program is quit.
If this is done, the only time the machine is in risk, is the time the software runs. After which the memory is clear from the text, and the
swap is cleared..
BTW. is there some kind of vi with encryption? meaning the plain-text is
never written to HD?
just my 2 cents.

Jippy I got the packaged compiled.
The automake scripts has a bug somewhere which did not allow me to compile
the software with the internal zlib, if I did not have a zlib on my machine.
did a ./configure --with-included-zlib
went to zlib
removed the -lz from the makefile
and did a 'make libzlib.a'
went to tools, removed the -lz from that makefile
went to g10 and replaced the -lz with -l../libzlib.a
and did a make/make install.
Ok hope you have that fixed in next release.
Something different.
I was trying to incoporate the gpg with my mailer. But i keep running into
your strange interface. The thing is, I don't get your redirection sceme.
Well I get it, but don't like it ;-)
Would it not be very handy to call gpg just as is, and see plain text as
output? Even if the input file is not a encrypted file.
And the encryption syntax forces me to print the plain text file (via
cat and pipe) and only then will I get my encrypted file on screen.
I would realy like to see some standaard unix interface here. Which is:
use stdin if no file is given. Use stdout if no redirection or '-o' is
I hope that with this I don't start up a discussion which has been closed
allready sometime ago..
Would anyone care to comment on this.
