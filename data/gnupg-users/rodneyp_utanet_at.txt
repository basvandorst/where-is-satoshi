@_subject: Error message attempting to sign a key 
First let me thank those who responded with how to subscribe.  I don't
know how I missed the mailing list info under documents on the gnupg
home page but I ended up on the gnu.org page and (IMHO) it's doesn't
seem to be explained there very clearly.  (Again I was probably looking
in the wrong place)
Anyway here's my question.  I'm trying to sign a key using gnupg1.0.4
and I' getting the following message in a loop.
gpg: waiting for lock (hold by 821 - probably dead) ...
gpg: waiting for lock (hold by 821 - probably dead) ...
and it goes on.
Any ideas what the problem is?
