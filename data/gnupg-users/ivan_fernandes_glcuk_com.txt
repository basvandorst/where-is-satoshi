@_subject: HELP... 
I am trying to work out how to use the GPG software. I have unzipped
gnupg-w32cli-1.2.1 and created entries in my registry file by running
gnupg-w32.reg. I have created a folder "gnupg" in my local C:\ drive.
There are 4 exe files (gpg.exe, gpgkeys_ldap.exe, gpgsplit.exe, gpgv.exe),
but I dont know how to get started. I have been looking at the read me files
and pdf manual, but they just talk about the command lines. I have read the
online help (FAO and HOWTO) but again there is no step by step on how to get
Please could you tell me which exe file I am supposed to use and how to
start encrypting a file. From what I have told you, have I actually
installed the software?
Many thanks for you help
