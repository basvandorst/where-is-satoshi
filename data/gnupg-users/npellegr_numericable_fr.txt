@_subject: Choosing the Hash and cyphering algorithm 
Hi all, Just an issue I hope somebody could help me with  :
1) How could I specify (whether it's possible!) what hash algorithm: MD5, SHA-1
TIGER ... (Ok i'm joking for MD5 !!) I want to use for signing ?
2) The same for symmetric cyphering, is possible to specify i need to use DES or
AES or 3-DES ?
3) Is it possible (like it's likely done during the signing step) to cypher
something using my RSA secret key ?
I can't see anything about it on the man page so ... because the gnupg.org
features page says it's compatible with those cryptosystems i'm wondering how
to use it using the command line.
Perhaps in the gpg.conf file but i can't find all available options.
Thank's for help !

Thank's for all Atom !
It works.
Almost ... actually I still can't force gpg to use the secret RSA key to
gpg -aer [long_or_short_key_id]! [file] => it uses the public key anyway
whithout asking for a special subkey. Actually with gpg i can't see the difference between the private key and the
public key whereas i know there is a big one ;).
The two keys fingerprints of the pair must be different but i can't see it and
moreover it looks like pub=sec.
By using : gpg --list-keys
gpg --list-secret-keys
the only difference is the "pub" and "sec" field whereas it should'nt.
Finally i tried  : gpg -aer [long_or_short_key_id]!sec[file] => error
gpg -aer [long_or_short_key_id] [file] => normal using
gpg -aer [long_or_short_key_id]![file] => idem
Is it possible to separate the secret key from the public one?

Well about he whole point and especially RSA I should be able to cypher with my
private key since the exponents are inverses :
q = e^-1 mod (p-1)(q-1)  with q the private exponent and e the public one.
Actually when you sign something it's c = RSA(priv,H(m))  with H the Hash function.
So I know it's possible. I only want to "c = m^q mod n"

Sorry I made a mistake switching d and q .. i modify the initial message !

I'm using gnupg with a RSA key pair and SHA-1 as the hash algorithm.
My pair needs my public key but doesn't want to install Gnupg because he's got
his own cryptotool.
I'd like to give him :
1) my public RSA key.
2) the key signature.
I want to do it myself =>  RSA(Kpriv,SHA-1(Kpub))
My pair should be able to :
1) to use the public key I sent to decode the signature.
2) to compute the SHA-1 sum of the public key I sent.
3) to compare the 2 sums.
I do know this is not enough to be sure this is my REAL public key (a known CA
signed certificate would be useful) but that's better than nothing.
So i need to cypher the hash sum of my public key by using my secret key.
(c=m^d [n])
I took a look to the gnupg sources and especially /cypher/rsa.c
and I can see a static function "secret" that does exactly what I need.
=> static void secret(MPI output, MPI input, RSA_secret_key *skey )
My question is : is it planned to enable users to use this function with
GnuPG/RSA users via the command line or should I modify GnuPG myself (but I
wouldn't have a standard GnuPG solution) ?

Sorry - I forgot to type the subject last time !
Thank's Werner I understand now .
So I should demand to use OpenPGP protocol.
Is there any X509 compatibility ? (even if the certificate'd be autosigned
anyway ...)
