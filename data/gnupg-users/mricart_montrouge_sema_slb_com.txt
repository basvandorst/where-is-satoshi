@_subject: Questions about subkeys acrobatics (from Adrian von Bidder article) 
Hi all,
I've read an article wrote by Adrian von Bidder (from   )
I don't understand a concrete idea concerning encryption subkeys.
First, distributing secret subkeys this way (one subkey for each account/machine you use) only makes sense with signing subkeys. You can have multiple encryption subkeys, but you can't force people sending you encrypted mail using a specific subkey. Naturally, if you're using encryption for yourself, you can chose the encryption key to use with the "keyid!" syntax. The presence of multiple encryption subkeys is, however, useful if you revoke an older one to replace it with a new one.
If I've understood the manoeuvre, you encrypt and sign from an insecure machine (signing with a subkey available only in this machine)  and the receptor can decrypt your signature (with the subkey pair available in your public key file).
So, why not encrypt with all encryption subkeys (signed with the primary key) available in the public key?? (like encrypt a message addressed to several GPG users, each with a personal public key)
Is GPG not implemented to encrypt a message with all the subkeys for encryption available in an imported public key??
Is not interesting to have this feature?? why??
Thanks for you feed-back,
