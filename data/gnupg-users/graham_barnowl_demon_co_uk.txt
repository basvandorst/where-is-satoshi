Though it is possible to add support for RSA and IDEA by compiling
them as modules and using load-extension. Which means that you can
communicate with PGP 2.x users.

I am having the same problem, and I *have* tried this solution and it
does *not* work.
The following output shows the problem:-
gpg: key 34D6A5FD: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
subsequent to this, gpg --list-keys does not list the key.

Thanks, fetching from the keyserver now work. However, trying to use
the ASC file still fails.

Gnus (with mailcrypt) can only handle in-line signatures. It cannot
either create or read separate PGP/Mime signatures.
