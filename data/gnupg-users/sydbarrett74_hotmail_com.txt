Hi all,
  I'm trying to build libksba in order to build gnupg, and here's the
make  all-recursive
Making all in gl
cp ./alloca_.h alloca.h-t
mv alloca.h-t alloca.h
make  all-am
-Wshadow -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-pointer-sign   -o libgnu.la
mkdir .libs ar cru .libs/libgnu.a
ar: no archive members specified

Hi all,
  I am having a problem with configure. It doesn't recognise that I have
these libraries already installed (which I do, and all the latest versions).
I'm using OSX 10.4.8...
*** You need libgpg-error to build this program.
**  This library is for example available at

Walter, thank you for this tip. I'm such an idiot: /usr/local/bin was not in
my path -- DOH! :( However, now I'm getting the following error during make:
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [kbxutil] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/Users/sydbarrett74/Desktop/gnupg-2.0.1/kbx'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/Users/sydbarrett74/Desktop/gnupg-2.0.1'
make: *** [all] Error 2

Yep. It wouldn't have let me run configure without it. So I had no choice.
This error creeps up during the 'make' step.
