@_subject: Building GnuPG for QNX 7 
I'm a software developer working on an embedded application that runs on QNX 7. I would like to use GnuPG to create encrypted software update files and decrypt them on the target system. However, I'm having trouble building GnuPG for QNX 7. My development environment is Windows 10 and the target is x86 running 64-bit QNX 7. QNX supposedly has some support for cross compiling GNU projects but I haven't been able to successfully build and QNX has not been very helpful when I tried to get support on this.
I think I have 2 options for approaching this, 1) pure QNX development tools (they have some limited posix tools like bash, etc. that run on Windows) or 2) Cygwin environment with some tricky setup to point to the QNX cross compiler, libraries, etc.
Any suggestions for how I should proceed?
