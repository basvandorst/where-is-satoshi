@_subject: key generation 
I use gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.6 on LinuxRH 6.1, and a perl
script of mine performs a GPG key generation (1024 bits)
on demand via web, but generation timing is too long for
browser's timeout ... 'cause low system entropy level.
GPG should use /dev/random device by default; it's
possible to force gpg to use /dev/urandom instead?
If I understand correctly, /dev/urandom
return data even if the entropy is low rather
than blocking like /dev/random ... so gpg --key-gen
should be faster ...
