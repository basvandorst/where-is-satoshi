@_subject: scripting and trust validation 
I'm having a problem with GPG.  Here's what I want to do:
Create a top-level key that is only used for signing other keys. (Manager key)
Create a second-level key that is signed by the top-level key. (Alice's Send a file signed with Alice's key and Alice's public key itself to a remote host.
Have the remote host import Alice's public key, check it against the public key of the manager (which it already has, and has full owner-trust) and if it's okay, use Alice's key to check the signature on the file.
This seems to be possible, except that I can't find a way for GPG to exit with an error condition if Alice's key cannot be validated in the trustdb.  It prints WARNING messages and complains, but without actually parsing the textual output from GPG, I see no way of doing what I need.
Am I missing something?
