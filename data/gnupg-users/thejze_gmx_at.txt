@_subject: OT: Which smartphone would you use 
Hello everyone,
I know this is off-topic, but since it is related to IT security and therefore more or less to GNUPG, I hope that I get some helping answers, though.
Having been objecting to smartphones for a long time I fear that the time has come that I get one for myself. The question is which one.
IPhone is not an option, Android probably not, due to security considerations.
I want a hardware/software combination which provides a decent amount of security for my personal data. Jolla or Tizen comes to my mind, but as far as I have come with my research, hardware for those is difficult to get at least in Europe. So I am looking for some advice from the experts which are regulars on this mailing list and recommendations which hardware/software combination they would use resp. are using.
Thanks in advance and best regards
Thomas Hejze

Unfortunately their hardware dos not seem to support Ubuntu any more. I found the "Ubuntu Edition" under "obsolete models", even a cyanogen edition, but all their current models run on Android. The rest of their homepage is all marketing gibberish as it is the use, nowadays.
Best regards

Hi Dotan,

well first of all I would like to make phone calls.
I use kdepim for contacts, calendar and email, so kdepim should run on it or at least be syncable.
And gnupg should run on it. And yes, a secure browser, too.
Everything else is a nice-to-have. So I guess Linux is the OS of choice. Hardware is anything-that-runs-on-Linux.
I know it is possible to jailbreak  an Android phone, the question is how difficult is this (for me).
Best regards.

That project looks promising, however, I fear I am not able to spend $924.000 for my smartphone ;-)
Anyway that is what I am looking for, I hope they will make it. Nevertheless, even then it will take at least one year for them to bring their product to the market.
Looking at Tizen, Jolla, Firefox OS and Ubuntu Touch, I start to worry for the future of Open Source. Isn't there a business case for a FOSS smartphone?
Best regards

Thanks for the information, but what are the perspectives? Lets hope the community has enough endurance, but which hardware to buy in three or four
