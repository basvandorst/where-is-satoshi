@_subject: Is there a gpgkeys_mailto for Win32? 
gpgkeys_mailto is now a perl script and hence not natively supported
by Windows. I installed a perl interpreter and managed to activate
gpgkeys_mailto simply by typing its name under console, i.e.
"gpgkeys_mailto" instead of "perl -w gpgkeys_mailto", but gpg can't
recognize this.
I hacked into the source and found that the problem is gpg uses
CreateProcess API under Win32 instead of a simple system() call. In
fact, under Win32, system("gpgkeys_mailto") works while
CreateProcess(NULL, "gpgkeys_mailto", ...) fails.
So would the team either
1. provide a gpgkeys_mailto.exe for Win32;
2. find some workaround so that gpgkeys_mailto will work with a perl
interpreter and a sendmail installation;
or (the most native way)
3. write a .WSH file, and replace "sendmail" with a mailto url therein.

@_subject: Is there a gpgkeys_mailto for Win32? 
Thanks for your reply.
CreateProcess is stupid. It must know the module (perl.exe) name and
the exact path to gpgkeys_mailto.
Does windows' system() really return immediately? I searched MSDN and
found nothing about it. I wrote a short piece of code and it seems
taht system() returns the error code after the child process finishes,
If system() works, register the .PL suffix (usually done during the
perl installation), add .PL to $PATHEXT, rename gpgkeys_mailto to
gpgkeys_mailto.pl, then system("gpgkeys_mailto") will work.
If system() doesn't work, we have to write something like
CreateProcess(NULL, "perl -w \\GPG\\gpgkeys_mailto") if perl is in
.WSH (Windows Script Host) is supported natively by Win32. Its syntax
can be Java-like or VB-like. Detailed infomation can be found on MSDN
(under Web Developement->Scripting->Microsoft Script Technologies). A
mailto url is something like
"mailto:someone PGP PUBLIC
KEY BLOCK-----%0A%0DVersion:...."

Obviously you're using PGP/MIME and OE lacks support for that.
I guess Thunderbird's Enigma plug-in has an option to use inline PGP
mode instead of PGP/MIME that provides compatibility for OE and most
other email clients.

@_subject: Who can explain RSA key types for me? 
Hash: RIPEMD160
When running "gpg --expert --gen-keys", I have 6 key types for
(4) RSA (sign only)
This is somewhat a DSA equivalent which can be used with a subkey for
(6) RSA (sign & encrypt)
This is a v4 equivalent for v3 RSA keys? One key to do it all?
(8) RSA (sign & certify)
What's this? And what's the meaning of "to certify"? Does gpg use
"sign" for signing data and "certify" for signing other's pubkeys? (10) RSA (sign, encrypt and certify)
And this one?
And, when running "gpg --edit-key xxxxx", I note something called
"key usage". Again, there's "C" for certification, "S" for signing,
"E" for encryption and "A" for authentification. So what's the
essence of these four letters (especially the difference between C, S
and A)?
Thank you all!

@_subject: Does GnuPG consider supporting more charsets? 
Hash: RIPEMD160
I reckon lacking support for a specific display charset won't cause
much trouble among users using the same language, because one
language will mostly have only one common encoding beside utf-8.
But for CJK (Chinese, Japanese and Korean), there're usually more
than one encoding. For Chinese there're GB2312 (whose extension is
GB18030, used in the Mainland), HZ (used in Hong Kong) and Big5 (used
in Taiwan), so email users across the Taiwan strait do need utf-8 as
an intermedium when sending encryped messages, if they don't know
about PGP/MIME.
Now GnuPG doesn't know about either GB2312 or Big5, and therefore
treats the input as utf-8, and applies no conversion:
Message encoded in GB2312 --> (gpg encrypting) --> Message decoded in
So the Taiwanese receiptor will have an unreadable message.
How does the current version of GnuPG handle the conversion between
display charsets and utf-8? Thru libiconv or an internal translation
table? And what will the upcoming GnuPG 1.4 do? If GnuPG use
libiconv, I hope there won't be much work adding support for more
display charsets.

Just two little problems under Win32.
1. Line 782 of g10/http.c, you forgot to add
"addr.sin_addr.S_un.S_addr=inaddr;" after
"addr.sin_port=htons(port);". This will cause gpgkeys_hkp/gpgkeys_http
always tries to connect to 0.0.0.0.
2. Line 124 of keyserver/gpgkeys_finger.c, you wrote "memcpy
(&ad.sin_addr, &l, sizeof l);" while it should be "memcpy
(&addr.sin_addr, &l, sizeof l);".
All other's fine till now. Salut to the team!

I found in previous threads the interesting API VirtualLock, and MSDN
confirms this:
Pages that a process has locked remain in physical memory until the
process unlocks them or terminates.
I suppose it would appear in 1.4 but I haven't seen it in 1.3.91 yet.
Will it be in place, together with the reactivation of warning about
insecure memory under Win9x? Thanks.

Yes you encrypted the file but symmetrically, i.e. you didn't encrypt
the file to someone's public key but to a passphrase. I don't if MDC
takes effect in such case.
And I don't know what that small security glitch was, either. Did that
allow bad men to alter encrypted packets without decrypting them?

@_subject: Symmetric encryption and mdc 
Mainly for compatibility reasons, GnuPG uses MDC for symmetric
encryption only if you're using a newer cipher, which in turn means
that the expected repecient has a better chance to have an MDC-enabled
decoder (pgp or gpg).
As for "force-mdc' in gpg.conf, I guess there's no drawback when you
symmetrically encrypt a file only to yourself.

@_subject: [Announce] GnuPG 1.3.91 released (development) 
Since you built 1.2.6 from source instead of installing an rpm
package, you can safely download the 1.3.91 source and build it as you
did for 1.2.6, I suppose it'll overwrite the old binaries but conserve
other settings (e.g. locations of gpg.conf and keyrings).
Do a search of this list. I posted just a few days ago.

Well, a .tar.bz2 is just like a .zip. Extract all the files to the
directory where you've installed 1.2.5 (you may backup the old files
in advance), replace the old binaries and it'll run just fine because
a working environment for 1.2.5 is still working for 1.3.91.
That instruction is good but a little outdated and I've written
something complementary -- "Building GnuPG 1.3.x for Win32 using
MinGW" at  If you
have problems following instructions in these two articles, feel free
to contact me through emails.
And there's a third way, since you have a working FC2 -- you can
cross-build it under the CPD version of MinGW which is available at ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/people/werner/cpd/mingw32-cpd-0.3.1.tar.gz. I
reckon there are few problems because this way is official :-)But I'm
too lazy to try it out.

No, definitely not in this way. A common signature tailing the body is
different from a digital signature generated by GnuPG.

Internet Explorer 5.x and above will install mapi32.dll under
%SystemRoot%\system32, which acts as a central dispatcher for MAPI
calls. So when you call it, MAPISendMail() is actually handled by an
email client that supports MAPI (OE by default, might be Eudora or
Netscape too). And if there's no MAPI handler, mapi32.dll will fail
Anyway you can check the existence of mapi32.dll in run time with a
LoadLibrary() call.
