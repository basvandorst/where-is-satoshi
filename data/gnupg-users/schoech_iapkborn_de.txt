Hi !
Is there a compiler on your system ? Try "gcc -v". What does it say ?
Maybe it's an old version? If it's called differently: try adding a
link like
ln -s /whateveryourcompileris /usr/bin/gcc

Hi Ben !
Why don't you just add it temporarily to your keyring and delete it

Hello Eduardo !
First of all, as a general rule, not many people are using PGP/GPG
encryption (based on the number of people owning an email address). If
you want to send encrypted email to someone, you should ask him
whether he can handle encrypted mail and (if he can) for
his public key. If you know he does use encryption, maybe his key is
on his homepage ? You could also try to get it from a keyserver like
 There you can also search by name for keys of
somebody. For automatic retrieval, you can use horowitz.surfnet.nl
with the gpg command
gpg --keyserver horowitz.surfnet.nl --recv-key KeyID

@_subject: HOWTO Revoke a key without having any backup of the key pair 
Hash: SHA1
Hi !
No, because there is no way for anyone to know for sure that you are
the legal owner of the key you want to have deleted. That's what you
have your revocation certificate for (this is a good time to make one
myself :-)
Another problem is: Once you have placed a key on one keyserver, it is
automatically distributed to all keyservers worldwide. So even if you
can convince one administrator to remove your key, there will be many
many copies left on other keyservers and on harddisks of other people
who downloaded your key.
The revocation certificate on the other hand takes the same way as
your key when you upload it to a keyserver and will render your key
invalid everywhere. People who have downloaded your key have to update
their keyring and will get the certificate from the keyserver, IIRC.
Sorry to give you no better news !

Hi Nick !
They do :-) But you are right that there is nothing like a man page on
a windows system. You can find an online version of the GPG man(ual)
page at: Somewhere down the list of options you find "--export-secret-keys"
Others have already pointed out that it is enough to type "man gpg" on
a *nix box to get this information.
I didn't mean to offend, just to point him to where he can find
further information about all command-line options of gpg. That's why
I gave him the answer in addition to the hint to have a look at the
gpg docs.
Hope we can end this thread and have all learned something :-)

Hi Nick !
But it will work without the "-a" and "-o" as well. Just you get a
binary data format (there might be problems transmitting it) and the

Hello Frank !
gpg --export-ownertrust > trustdb.asc
This is called console redirection and will work with most programmes.
It tells Windows (or *nix) to print all normal output not to the
screen but to a certain file. Error messages are still printed on the
&> file
will redirect normal output and error messages to "file". This works
with Linux, don't know whether it works with DOS/Windows.
gpg --import-ownertrust < trustdb.asc
should import the trust values from "trustdb.asc". This tells
Windows/*nix to read all input from the file instead of reading from
the keyboard.

I look for the error message in the source code. It's produced in a
routine called "write_server" in "util/http.c" and is
Windows-specific. The error code 87 stands for
"ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER" as reported by the Windows-API function
I'm not running Windows so I can't reproduce it. Sorry that I have no
better news for you. Maybe some of the developers can make more sense
out of it.

Hi !
This will sign "file" with your key.
This will sign "file" and produce ASCII-armoured output
You should use
gpg -e file
gpg -ea file
to actually encrypt "file".
You can also do both:
gpg -es file
gpg -esa file
Then you can decrypt with:
gpg -d .....

Hi !
If you do a "dir" on the commandline, you will see that gpg has
created a file called "text.txt.gpg" which is the encrypted one. The
original data (unencrypted) is still in "text.txt".
You have to decrypt the encrypted file, obviously.
gpg -d text.txt.gpg
will work :-)
