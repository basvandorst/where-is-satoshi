@_subject: upgrade / install help 
I've got version 1.07 installed on a RH Linux 7.3 box, and I'm trying to upgrade to 1.2.4.
The current install was complied from source, not an RPM.
I've tried installing 1.2.4 but when I try to compile I get these errors:
In file included from compress-bz2.c:23:
make[2]: *** [compress-bz2.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/hsphere/install/gnupg-1.2.4/g10'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/hsphere/install/gnupg-1.2.4'
make: *** [all] Error 2
How can I resolve these errors and complete the installation?
Thanks!
