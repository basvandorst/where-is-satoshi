Bad news. Sorry. Game over. Unfortunately you're S-o-L.
If it was as easy as a bash script to brute force a passphrase, do you think
people would even consider using PGP?  The passphrase is /intentionally/
designed to resist brute force attacks.
I'm sure programs exist that purport to brute force passphrases. I think that
their success rate, r, is probably somewhere between epsilon and zero.
