@_subject: Win7: Kleopatra does not open 
Dear Forum,
I recently installed GnuPG (Gpg4Win). My purpose is to be able to create encrypted files for exchange via email. No integration with an email client such as Thunderbird.
Therefore I need to be able to execute Kleopatra or GPA. Unfortunately Kleopatra does not work. I tried both from a desktop shortcut, and the command prompt (terminal). Just no reaction at all.
I tried several re-installs. On 2 occasions it got working, but gave up a day later. Reinstall .... some success, and then failure again ...
Any suggestions?
Best regards,
Roland Siemons

Hello list,
I share the wish for encrypted email on Android, but I am afraid of storing a secret key on my android phone. (theft, hacking, loss, etc) How do you feel about that?
Could a pincard be connected via micro USB? And made to work?

Dear GNUPGs,
I have strange troubles with my key.
I DO can decrypt encrypted files that other people prepared for me,
using the public part of my key for encryption.
I canNOT decrypt files that were made by myself, using the same key. I
receive this error message:
"The GPGME library returned an unexpected error at
gpafiledecryptop.c:540. The error was: No secret key."
I am using GPA with GnuPG 2.2.10.
Please advise!

@_subject: gpg troubles 
Dear GnuPG experts,
1/ Thanks and compliments to those who make GnuPG possible!
2/ I am a very ordinary end-user who unfortunately cannot fall back to
computer experts easily in his vicinity. One of those for whom forum
assistance and manuals are very important.
3/ Assisted remotely by some of you, I was able to sort out a very
strange problem with decryption. The solution was found by manipulating
my key from inside the gpg shell using the command line. I am not very
experienced with the command line. A major difficulty for those for whom
this is not daily bread and butter is that mistakes are easily made.
Hence the great value of GUIs.
4/ I observed some unclarities in the GnuPG manual
( here below under A. And perhaps also
some bugs in gpg, here below under B (please consider). Here is my
A/ I tried to revoke some subkeys, following the said manual (heading
"Revoking key components"). gpg pretended to do the job. Everything
looked fine. But it did'nt! After several hours of analysis (up to
checking if GnuPG was installed consistently on my system), I found the
issue: After the revkey procedure it is necessary to command "quit".
Instead of quitting, gpg then asks "do you want to save yr changes" (or
something like that). And only then the subkeys were revoked. The said
manual does mention the command "quit" only once, and not even in a
general place explaining the operations of gpg, and in fact without any
explanation as to the impact of that command. Of course I am happy to
have found out, but let's hope that I remember when after perhaps 2
years time I have to use gpg shell again....
B/ It is not at all clear to me how to start the gpg shell. For example:
1/ if (under the CMD terminal) I command "gpg -K", the lists of private
keys is returned, but I am also returned to CMD, that is, kicked out of
the gpg shell.
2/ if (CMD) I command "gpg --edit-key X" (where X is key identifier), I
do indeed enter the gpg shell, the screen showing "gpg>".
That all may be allright, HOWEVER:
3/ if (CMD) I command "gpg", the return is: "gpg: WARNING: no command
supplied.? Trying to guess what you mean ...  gpg: Go ahead and
type your message . Then if I type a gpg command, everything stalls. No results whatsoever.
Even the command "quit" gives no results. So I force quit by Ctrl-C.
So, in general, how to start the gpg shell?
(FYI: the Windows Powershell ISE shows more weird behaviour than the CMD
This is my system:
gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.10
libgcrypt 1.8.2
I hope that the above could be of some use to the developers.
Best regards

@_subject: revocation troubles & smartcard troubles 
Dear GnuPG,
I am already using GnuPG for a long time. But try to improve my
understanding of and working with it.
I became a member of Free Software Foundation Europe, and got a
smartcard. I wanted to use it.
And that is where the trouble started:
I intended to copy all my personal keys to the smart card.
In Kleopatra, I selected "Tools/Manage smartcards"
Then I selected "Import a certificate from a file", and selected files
from my laptop.
I was under the impression that I was copying files to the smartcard.
By doing so, I not only selected my private key but also my revocation
key (because, why should I enable a thief of my laptop to revoke my key?).
And then it appeared that I had revoked my entire key pair. Unintended!
Apparently, under smartcard management, I was not at all copying files
to the smartcard. Apparently, I was doing something else. Did I at all
copy files to the smartcard?
Can I UNrevoke that key?
How can I see what is on the smartcard?
How can I copy files to the smartcard?
I studied the GnuPG Smartcard How-To
( but that is
entirely linux oriented.
I am working on a win7 system.
Can anyone help me further?

@_subject: Local solutions: SKS Keyserver Network Under Attack [edited] 
Dear Forum,
GNUPG Users Digest is nearly flooding my mailbox with exchanges about the WoT and keyserver issues.
A simple user (me) needs to know how one could make adaptations in the settings of GPA or Kleopatra. I would expect instructions here:
or perhaps here:
*There are not.*
Hansen's and DKG's blog are only partly helpful. For example my Linux system seems to *not* have a? ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf file at all (one of those files recommended for editing). I.e. Nautilus cannot find it.
So, I did adapt gpg.conf by outcommenting ( any line starting with keyserver, but was not able to adapt the dirmngr.conf.
Upon inspection, thereafter, my GPA and Kleopatra were NOT correctly Trying to figure out how GPA and Kleopatra could be adapted, I found, for GPA: Menu > Edit > Backend preferences > Network > Configuration for Keyservers > Use custom value > adapt to hkps://keys.openpgp.org
For Kleopatra: Menu > Settings > Configure Kleopatra > Directory Services > Open PGP Keyserver > adapt to hkps://keys.openpgp.org
(I would have included an inline screenshot, but this list is allergic to html)
Apparently these GUI manipulations generated the ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf file! (Only hereafter they existed). And that file indeed showed the new GPG4Win and Enigmail need further research. (This is a suggestion. I cannot do it).
And further, I would have expected a program update that sets the defaults to the ones suggested by Hansen and DKG. Or is the matter still under consideration, or is it not that important? (I personally cannot judge it).
The only hint that I can give: The WoT nor keyservers are not very important in my case. I use GnuPG inside a small group of people who (for identity verification) can talk to each other, at least by telephone. I do not use Enigmail (since limited to few mail clients and not accepted by sufficient of my recipients), but just send encrypted messages as attachments.
Best regards

Thanks, Peter, for this confirmation.
You give further detail to what I had guessed in the course of playing with the settings of GPA and Kleopatra.
I conclude that there are at least two possible actions for those who want to protect there systems:
In the GUIs of GPA or Kleopatra to fiddle the settings as I suggested earlier in this thread. And for Enigmail: your suggestion
In the terminal, to edit ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf so as to say "keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org/" or, if that file does not exist to create it as per your suggestion.
This could be useful for some mere common GnuPG users, like me.
Some side thoughts:
1/ Perhaps the fear of compromised communication (including distributed software, private messages) can be mitigated by practicing short feed back lines: confirmations. Like "did you get my communication, what did it say?"
2/ Perhaps one should not give too much trust to a WoT at all. After all, a crook can pretend to be a friend, and thus yield the entire WoT untrustworthy. Sometimes a friend becomes an enemy at a later stage. As a very ordinary mere user, I do not really understand the trust levels that GnuPG asks me to consider. How can a WoT that is not 100% understood by absolutely all users be reliable?
3/ With these thoughts, I hope NOT to embarrass the developers. Forget it, if you consider it useless for your troubles. (Thanks for GnuPG!)

The automated software manager says that its GNUPG version is For a transfer to GnuPG 2.2.17, what do you recommend?:
- To wait for the Mint managers to update their repository
- To uninstall GNUPG 2.2.4-1ubuntu1.2, and install v. 2.2.17 (However: for v. 2.2.4, software manager says: "cannot remove" !!! How then?)
- Something else

Dear List,
I explained a problem.
I proposed a step forward towards a solution.
There were 17 responses.
So far, those responses either:
- advised to no longer use GnuPG, or
- denied or downplayed the problem (although I demonstrated the existence of the problem), or
- argued against those who denied or downplayed the problem.
No single response touched upon my proposal. This is very disappointing.
Developers, please consider my proposition, and tell me what you like or dislike about it.

@_subject: We have GOT TO make things simpler 
Dear GNUPG developers,
We have GOT TO make things simpler.
1/ I do have some years of experience with GnuPG. Especially with convincing people to use it. It is not easy. But I do it because it is in my interest to be able to communicate privately.
2/ My latest experience is with a person who sent me his entire keypair per email. I had asked him to send me his public key only. I had instructed him how to prepare that file ("export public key, do NOT export the secret half of the keypair. Ensure this by ticking the right boxes. If you use GPA do it like this, if you use Kleopatra, follow those menu trails, if you use GPG Tools I do not know."). The person who made the horror of sending his secret key over email is properly educated.
3/ Please do appreciate that the persons who we are convincing and instructing are not particularly interested in privacy. They need simple 4/ Here is my proposal:
4.1/ Stimulate that people use a GUI like GPA or Kleopatra. Not Enigmail, although it offers the same, but it offers too much for beginners. Email integration comes after people have a basic understanding. Please do appreciate if people only want to be able to prepare encrypted documents for sending them as attachments.
4.2/ Ensure that, when generating a keypair, GnuPG creates one directory "Secretkeys", and one directory "Publickeys". Make GnuPG to store the public part and the secret part separately in those directories. If GnuPG needs also keypairs in a single file, store that under Secretkeys.
4.3/ Get rid of the confusing menu/Exportkeys/ vs menu/Exportsecretkey. etc.
4.5/ Get rid of the options to NOT publish keys on keyservers. Just work the opt-in alternative: If you want to publish to keyservers, make that a separate action that requires some effort.
Best regards,
