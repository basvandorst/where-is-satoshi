@_subject: RSA 4096 ridiculous? (was RSA 1024 ridiculous) 
In my view, gnupg already offers too much choice. There is no real
reason to have so many options. They should have given 2 to chose from -
a small and fast and a large and slow (both sort of balanced, too), say
a) DSA-1024 (SHA1) & Elgamal-1024, cipher 3DES - fingerprint SHA1
b) DSA-3072 (SHA256) & Elgamal-3072, cipher AES-128 - fingerprint SHA256
If one of the ingredients is broken, gnupg has to be redesigned anyways.
 The idea that we can simply go on in this case and use the fallback
functions doesn't seem realistic to me. The easiest case to handle
(fallback-wise) would be that AES is broken. But even then there would
be a huge chaos and thousands of keys would have to be updated etc
(which many users won't do anyways), so that the web of trust will break
down then. A complete start will be best even in this case, with new keys.

@_subject: ed25519 and sha256 
I have a question regarding ed25519 as implemented in gnupg 2.2.17, libgcrypt 1.8.4.
Let?s say I sign a file. When checking the signature with verbose output, I can see that sha256 was used
gpg: binary signature, digest algorithm SHA256, key algorithm ed25519
According to Wikipedia "Ed25519 is the EdDSA signature scheme using SHA-512 and Curve25519?. Granted, I have sha256 in my preferences, but the standard should override that, correct? I wonder, because in a different application (iPGMail) using the same key with the same embedded preferences, sha512 is used.
