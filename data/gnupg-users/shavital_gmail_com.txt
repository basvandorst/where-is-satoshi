Following my post of August 1/2012, I could compile GnuPG 2.0.19 under
Mac OS 10.8 (Mountain Lion, Darwin x86_64-apple-darwin12.0.0) using a
script written by Ludwig H?gelsch?fer, based upon a script written by
Alex Willner, and with a Mac-native pinentry-mac.app written by Ben
Donnachie in cooperation with GPGtools.org.

Why forced?
Nobody is forcing anyone to do anything.
You want to use encryption, use it.
You don't want to use it, don't.
Nobody has to hide, this is not about hiding.
A fortiori, when one sends or receives an encrypted message, the mere
format of such a communication hollers loud and clear that the user is
protecting his/her communications, not hiding.
Freedom is freedom to think freely; and to act freely within the rules
of law.
If one finds the law questionable, there are constitutional and
democratic means to express and ask for revision or change of the law.
Or who knows?
This is my first and last contribution to this thread.
You all have a fine week end.

@_subject: message signature types 
S/MIME = Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions is a standard for
public key encryption and signing of e-mail encapsulated in MIME.
It achieves goals that are similar to GnuPG's but uses different means.
The use of GnuPG requires the installation of GnuPG software, and some
kind of module that will enable interaction between that software and
the e-mail client one is using. GnuPG per se enables its user to
generate and manage certificates (aka keys).
S/MIME does not require the installation of any such software but needs
to obtain and install a certificate/key that is issued by a Certificate
Authority (CA). The certificate that is issued by the CA of your choice
has to be imported into your e-mail client (if it has S/MIME capability)
or into your browser.
You might try .
I am sure members of this list will provide more accurate information.

Robert J. Hansen <4FCC11F2.6050303 at sixdemonbag.org> June 4, 2012 4:22:54
Section "4.7 How do I validate another person?s certificate?" does not
deal with what one should do once she/he has signed another person's
certificate (after completing the validation process).
I believe the etiquette is that the signed key block should be returned
to the certificate's owner, for her/him to do what he/she deems
convenient, e.g. upload it to a keyserver.
The signer himself/herself should not upload the sign key block to a key
server, or publish it in any other way, without the certificate's owner
explicit authorization or request.
That may be hair splitting and not etiquette, but I believe the issue
should be clarified. I have had at least two of my certificates signed
by someone with whom I had never gone through any kind of validation
process, or even discussed the possibility of such a process. The person
just signed my certificate and uploaded it to a keyserver.
End of rant.

I had the same problem a short time ago, and solved it with the help of
a friend, and this is what I did in MacOSX's Terminal
$ gpg edit-key [key ID]
Secret key is available,
pub 2048R/[key ID] created: [..] expires: [..]  usage: SC
       trust: ultimate     validity: ultimate
sub 2048R/[sub-key ID] created: [..] expires: [..]  usage: E
pub  2048R/[key ID] created: [..] expires: [..]  usage: SC
        trust: ultimate     validity: ultimate
sub*  2048R/[sub-key ID]  created: [..] expires: [..] usage: E
[note the asterisk after sub, that indicates that this is the key which
has been selected for expiry]
then again:
I got:
Changing expiration time for a subkey.
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
        = key expires in n days
      w = key expires in n weeks
      m = key expires in n months
      y = key expires in n years
Hope this helps.
I don't know whether you can use this method in your system.
You seem to be using web-mail with html format.
