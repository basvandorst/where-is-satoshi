@_subject: GPG and PGP 
1.     I've tried to install PGP 6.5.8 on SUSE SLES 11 and it doesn't
work. I gave up and 2.     Try to import the pgp (6.5.8) keys (public and private) on my
server (SUSE SLES 11) with GPG 2.0.9.
While importing the private key, I get gpg: key B5AC473D: secret key imported
gpg: key B5AC473D: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: /home/appl/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: key B5AC473D: public key "epflpepfl" imported
gpg: WARNING: key B5AC473D contains preferences for unavailable
algorithms on these user IDs:
gpg:          "epflpepfl": preference for cipher algorithm 1
gpg: it is strongly suggested that you update your preferences and
gpg: re-distribute this key to avoid potential algorithm mismatch
Set preference list to:
     Cipher: AES256, AES192, AES, CAST5, 3DES
     Digest: SHA1, SHA256, RIPEMD160
     Compression: ZLIB, BZIP2, ZIP, Uncompressed
     Features: MDC, Keyserver no-modify
Really update the preferences? (y/N) y
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for

gpg: cancelled by user
gpg: update_keysig_packet failed: General error
Key not changed so no update needed.

gpg:               imported: 1

gpg:   secret keys imported: 1
so I tried to edit this key and try to change the password. See below.
There is no prompt for passphrase and it just exit.

Still trying hard to figure pgp and gpg out.

@_subject: GPG and non ssh user 
Dear All,
due to our new security, we have to login in Linux SLESS 11 with a
personal "ABC" ssh-user then change to a batch user with the commands
sudo -i -u . And tty belongs to user "ABC" and not batchuser.
I could import new keys, both private and public and also decrypt a
pgp-encrypted file under the user ABC but it doesn't work when I run gpg
with batchuser. The batchuser is not a ssh user. How can I make gpg
works under a batchuser? Can anybody help?
Desperate looking for a solution
