@_subject: newbie question about installing security patch 
Hi there,
Just downloaded 1.0.4 and it works fine. Downloaded the security patch as well,
but cannot find the actual patch, let alone how to install it.
Do I have to install the security patch, even though I downloaded the latest
version of GNUPG?
If so, how should I go about?
Any help will be appreciated!

But he wasn't able to figure out how to get MS Outlook Express 5.5 to work with
So I took a copy of Windows 98SE, installed it (took me 2 hours and I think the
thing has been rebooted a million times). Got it on the internet, downloaded
GPG4win, got it running, but I don't understand how to get Outlook Express
(V5.0) to work with GPG either! I thought Windows was supposed to be for
computer-illiterates? Easy for anyone who has never worked with a computer
before. Outlook Express is jabbering about certificates and file-types and
such. It won't recognize any key, not in any format?
Can anybody tell us how to get this stuff up 'n runnin' under Window$?

What your seeing is OE's standard encryption system S/Mime, which is
not what you want.
As GnuPG runs from the command line, you will need a Windows front end
such as GnuPGShell which is available from
 and I would also suggest you get the
version of GnuPG with the security patches and the IDEA module from
This will enable you to use Outlook Express with GnuPG but from
outside the e-mail program.  If you want to use e-mail programs with
GnuPG support built in, get the beta version of The Bat! or Becky!2
with its BkGnuPG plug in.

You might try installing netscape and using it instead.  And as a plus, it
have the huge security holes in it that Outlook express has.  I don't think the
private key is secure if you use outlook express since almost any virus or work
easily come in through it without detection, and many of them turn your system
a server so it can be hacked from over the internet.

I did that also and the following struck me as odd:
I've got 2 machines and installed the SuSE 1.0.6 rpm on both, so I needed to
export my secret keys from machine 1 in order to use them on machine 2. But GPG
never asked me for a passphrase during these actions. So I could simply export
my secret keys and import them on my other machine, no questions asked. Is that

Well, actually I sent two replies. The first one does have the in-reply-to
header as you can see. I sent the second one, because I thought I forgot to
include the list. To send this one I just re-opened th already sent message and
thus it did not inclade a in-reply-to header.
So nobody has been stripping them off, my mistake really ;-)
BTW: my mailclient (pronto:  does thread the
messages without the in-reply-to header. It has a 'tread by subject option'
which works correctly 99% of the time.

if your encrypted message is called message.txt.gpg, you simply type
'gpg message.txt.gpg', assuming you have the key the message was encrypted for.
After entering your passphrase you'll have a file message.txt in the same

Hi there,
just installed 1.0.5 and it gives me the 'please note that you don't have
secure memory on this system' all the time, although I have the
no-secmem-warning enabled in my options file. How come?

I use GPG 1.0.5 on a Caldera eDesktop 2.4 system and I didn't have any problems
installing it.
The only thing I have since using 1.0.5 is that GPG keeps telling me I have
insecure memory, although I have disabled this message in the options-file. I
didn't have that with 1.0.1 and 1.0.4.

yep, also have a look at  (article on the same subject in Dutch)
What would this mean for GPG, the use of GPG and the implementation of GPG?
Is there such a thing as a 'backdoor' in GPG?
What encryption methodes do the TTP's use and how would they be able to build
in a backdoor so that they can decrypt their clients messages independantly?

Right! ;-)
Even when I would have the time, it's probably too complicated for me. Will
check though, in due time (when I'm 50 and retired :-))

@_subject: 2 different fingerprints for the same key? 
Hi All,
I haven't been subscribed to the list for a long time, so could be that this
question has been asked and answered before, but I could not find the answer to
my question anywhere in the archives, faq's, how-to's or usermanual, but I
haven't been looking for hours either ;-)
Please explain the 2 different fingerprints in the following:
*** BEGIN ***
Remco ) gpg -u rpl -r ebijlsma -se test.txt
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Remco Lubbers (on Fast-ADSL) "
1024-bit DSA key, ID 5FE087E1, created 2001-05-28
File `test.txt.gpg' exists. Overwrite (y/N)? yes
Remco > gpg -u rpl -r jasper -se test.txt
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Remco Lubbers (on Fast-ADSL) "
1024-bit DSA key, ID 5FE087E1, created 2001-05-28
Could not find a valid trust path to the key.  Let's see whether we
can assign some missing owner trust values.
No path leading to one of our keys found.
2048g/192D448E 2000-11-16 "Jasper van den Bosch "
It is NOT certain that the key belongs to its owner.
If you *really* know what you are doing, you may answer
the next question with yes
Use this key anyway? no
gpg: no valid addressees
gpg: test.txt: sign+encrypt failed: no such user id
Remco > gpg --fingerprint jasper
pub  1024D/C3C734E6 2000-11-16 Jasper van den Bosch      Key fingerprint = ED06 EE7F 70B6 CEE0 4E37  597A EADA D7BD C3C7 34E6
uid			       Jasper van den Bosch sub  2048g/192D448E 2000-11-16
Remco >
*** END ***
In this case it's rather obvious the it shows the fingerprint of the subkey
(why?), but I've had other cases where the fingerprint of the primary key was
shown, but the fingerprints were not the same. The fingerprint in the "can not
find valid trust path"-part always seems to end with the key's ID.
Can anyone clarify?
