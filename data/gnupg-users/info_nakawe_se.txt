@_subject: Freedom of speech(was: Cipher etc.) 
I definately agree with Graham, but wanted to add my own thoughts.
I think it's safe to say that the original comment was not "bashing".
If you have the same program installed on different OS:es, whether
it is totally different one's or different versions of the same OS
you will have different problems, a bug that appears in one OS will
not nessecarily show up in all OS:es. Hence it is a good step towards
solving a problem to know what kind of platform it occurs on, I would This said, try not to take peoples comments as an offence, even though
it might seem like it to you. This sort of thing is what starts wars
and other ugly things.
Also one person saying something that you consider offensive is no
reason to start acting in the same manner. If you do, you really have
no right to complain about how the person was acting, since you do
the same thing yourself.
Just my two cents...

@_subject: gpg crashes when attempting to create key 
I'm running gpg under winpt on win2k and everytime I attempt to create a
key the program is closed by windows. Has anyone had a similar problem? I
havn't been able to find any information searching the archives.

@_subject: www.gnupg.org unaccessible ? 
Dito, I use a text-only client and any html-formatted emails I get I just
throw away, unless its from someone I know in which case I tell them to
start using plain text. Even if say a message only is 3 times as large
in html-formatting, what possible reason is there to clutter the internet
and people's inboxes with that much pointless text in the form of html-tags?

@_subject: unsubscribe me 
Subscribing and unsubscribing can be done at the following adress, as noted in the introductory mail that I got when I subscribed... The mail also says:
You can also make such adjustments via email by sending a message to:
  Gnupg-users-request
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions
I suggest that you try one of these things if you want to unsubscribe.

@_subject: FREE Virus And Spam Protection for Windows Users 
I know this is off topic but I would still like a clarification on the
non-freeness of programs that run on windows. What exactly does that mean?
An open source program that runs on Windows is not OS? I was under the
impression that OS programs including gnupg when run on a mswin machine was
still OS.

@_subject: What is wrong here? 
No it's an automatic bounce, "from" is not replaced on this list so it gets
sent to the original sender.
