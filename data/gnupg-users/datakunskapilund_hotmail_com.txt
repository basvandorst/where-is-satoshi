@_subject: GPG creates two files? 
OK, I use GPG to encrypt a Word file. Everything works out ok, but the result
is always two files: the Word file in plain text and an encrypted version of
the same Word file.  Why is GPG creating two files? Should it not just
encrypt my Word file?

Thank you very much for your answer! Do you know if there is an graphical
user interface to this GnuPG?
