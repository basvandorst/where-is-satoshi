@_subject: import public keys generated with PGP 7.0.3 
The following worked for me:
rhauser gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import gpg: key 49A176DA: secret key imported
gpg: key CA540C55: secret key imported
gpg: key E5A6DD35: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: key CB1E9CA9: no valid user IDs
gpg: key 57548DCD: not changed
gpg: key A7619BBC: not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 446
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 226
gpg:              unchanged: 217
gpg:       secret keys read: 3
gpg:  secret keys unchanged: 3
The Outlook key manager gpg_gpa from  is little bit slow, but it seems to work.
Although it did loose the expiration date of my key and additional names.

@_subject: how to send an encrypted and signed message from the command line most efficiently without using keyrings 
gives some hints,
but not all I envision
What would be the correct syntax?
gpg -s signer.asc -e receiver.gpg  message.txt --batch | mail bob
I manage the keys in a database outside gpg's keyrings. What is the best
format to hand them over to the gpg executable armoured or binary?
"--default-key" doesn't really get the key from a file and
with --no-default-keyring, how can just specify single keys?
Many thanks for any hints in advance!
P.S.: It would be great to add this to the FAQ and the gpg man-page examples
much like the

@_subject: how to authenticate an ldaps keyserver lookup  
A closed community would like to use gpg to retrieve the keys of other member. To keep the community closed and protect them from spam. They would like query an ldap server through SSL with username password authentication.
While gpg appears to support "ldaps", I didn't see a way to communicate that username/password pair in a lookup like
   gpg --keyserver ldaps://somehost:636 --search micky
Also the --keyserver-options parameters do not appear to offer taking a password.
How can this be done with gpg?
Furthermore, when trying to do that with apache's ldap server, it did not like the SSL it got from my gpg ( Has anyone experienced the same? Any hints would be highly appreciated.
   Regards Ralf
P.S.: With  both the password and the SSL problem do not occur, but I'd rather not ask the users of the community to install yet another security tool - hopefully gpg can do that!
