@_subject: different idea.c files 
I compiled and installed gnupg 1.0.6 with the idea.c module
on a OpenBSD 2.9 (-release) system with the system=B4s make,
and two different idea.c files.
The configure and compile processes and options were:
tar zxf gnupg-1.0.6.tar.gz; cd gnupg-1.0.6
cp .../idea.c cipher/
(applied OpenBSD patches from
... except the patch-g10* patches which I believe applied to
./configure --with-included-gettext
The results were different depending on the idea.c file I
- if I use the one downloaded from=20
it compiles and installs ok.
- if I use the one downloaded from
it stops at the following make error:
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I../include -I../intl		\
-g -O2 -Wall -DIS_MODULE -shared -rdynamic -fPIC -Wl,-Bshareable \
-Wl,-x -o idea ./idea.c
./idea.c:61: Invalid token in expression
*** Error code 1
I also tried to compile/install it from the OpenBSD ports collection
(modifying the ports Makefile and removing patch-g10*):
cd /usr/ports/security/gnupg
env FLAVOR=3Didea make NO_CHECKSUM=3DYES
which works if using idea.c from the above mentioned ftp directory.
Just curious why it won=B4t work with the idea.c from gnupg.dk.
Thank You,

I belive they refer to it as *old* rather than *outdated* or
*obsolete*.  There is a slight difference imho.
If you complain about mutt not offering an easier (rather
more obvious) way to deal with text/pgp, then fine.  But
there is nothing wrong with them favouring pgp/mime.
"most mail clients ..."=20
command line 'mail' comes to my mind, but then it doesn=B4t
understand ascii/pgp either :)
Some mailing lists I subscribe to filter messages with demime
to strip any mime attachement before distributin it (all
OpenBSD mailing list but one).  I agree that mime attachments
to mailing lists are a nuisance.
Any pgp signature, be it pgp/mime or
ascii-armored|application/pgp, should not be included in a
post to a mailing list unless it is utterly important to
confirm the authory of the message.  Sadly, it is up to
individuals to learn good net manners and to decide.
In what sense is app/pgp broken? (just asking).
Then, this might be an argument for considering mail clients
with no pgp/mime capabilities as broken cryptowise.
No need to go overboard, just to apply a demime filter.
A better (ideal) choice would be to educate people, but
that=B4s a chimera right now.

In that case signing the message would be the right thing to
do.  And, rather than including the patch with the message,
providing a pointer where to d/load the patch and a detach
No, since most people will not have a system to check the sig
(and most of those who have a pk system won=B4t have her key),
this is useless at large.  But, MOST IMPORTANT, she could
post nice messages to the ng pgp-signed, and yet SHE could
at the same time post nasty ones without a signature.  What=B4s
in her public key that I can use to verify that a non-signed
message is not from her?  This is nonsense.
But this is just one example where a signature is needed.  We
mostly deal with huge loads of people who flood mailing lists
with pgp-signed messages just for asking how to unsubscribe
from the list!!!
Long ago (at around gpg-0.X ... forgot), I asked Werner why
he wouldn=B4t use signatures in his mails.  The answer was
something like "nothing of what I=B4m writing is so important
as to require a digital signature".  Then I realize this was
not just a programmer=B4s toy.
There are cases where it is needed or required, and that=B4s
the point of it, to use it where needed/required.  Which does
not equal to abuse it.

Two examples:
- gnupg-users mailing list.  If there was a
  horrible bug in gnupg, do you thing W. Koch will send the
  patch attached to his message along with the signature, or
  will he put the patch file and a detached signature file in
  the ftp server and give the pointer to the ftp location
  with the security announcement?
- [lists] mailing lists.  They are for discussion
  of various topics related to the OS and implemented
  architectures, changes in source or ported software, for
  developers, for advocacy, announcements and security
  announcements.  The load is high in at least a few of them,
  and many used to send all their messages MIME/PGP signed.
  No matter how feeble the message was.  You know, there is
  some processing involved with checking for a key you most
  surely do not have.  And that happened with every MIME/PGP
  signed message you opened to read.  What=B4s the point?  To
  give the whole world assurance that Joe User on the Nth day
  of the X month of the MM year did ask where he could
  download an iso image?
  They applied this demime software for all lists except for
  the ports@ list, which indeed requires people to send their
  ported software to be tested.
Now, the mailing list for your example is ONE where it should
be allowed and encouraged, but that doesn=B4t extend to ALL
lists.  But if there is a real compelling reason to do so,
you can still do it by encoding if there is a demime filter.

So you could have growing trust on that key after more and
more messages from the same sender come signed with it.  Fair
But, do you really expect that people who neglect the golden
security rule of "not running binaries or installing code
sent to them or to public forums" to track the relationship
between the sender and the key over time?
There is no point in telling people to install strong secure
door locks at their homes if they are going to leave their
home doors opened.

[*] No, we are talking of a process which gets started
everytime one opens a message that=B4s been digitally signed,
and which is a case of 1 out X messages for each mailing list
one is subscribed to.
Which is just what I wrote.
I see, meaning you don=B4t give a monkey=B4s ass whether it=B4s a
bother for subscribers or not???
Who you are, where you live, your ethnic group, sex or sex
preferences, or your name is completely irrelevant to me if
it is all about reading an answer or question from you
related to a specific subject.  So, I couldn=B4t care less if I
can verify any of the above or else from a digital signature.
You know, it=B4s like all those annoying vcards, or those long
signatures with ascii-disart included.  They are not big
deal, but they are not good nettiquete either.
Of course, iyho.
No, no big deal (but see [*]).  Unwrapped long lines are a
worst nuisance than some added 251 bytes.

So I should disable one feature in my MUA (it is not PGP or
GPG that is configured to verify automatically) because some
people just do not want to make a fair and rational use of
digital signatures.
Ok, just hope you get the same type of responses to your
problems through life, as you just deserve them.
Well, you just misunderstood.
See, some people firmly believe that all persons should be
straight.  They are on their own right.  But they would be
wrong if they went trying to impose those beliefs in any way
whatsoever to those who are different or think different.
If you really want to advocate crypto on mail, you could do
things like adding your fingerprint at the bottom of messages
after your non-digital sig, or a page explaing why it should
always be used and a pointer to that page at the bottom of
your messages.
Alright.  I can=B4t say more about this if your rule for
measuring is that of acceptance.
Right so.

No, you shoul not disable anything, just use things as
intended.  I=B4m not going to convince you to stop toying
around, as you care not for anything but your whimming
Yes, by trying to stick cryptography into their noses.
No flaming there, I truly hope it.
That=B4s your saying, and yet people who think and act like you
do slow down my reading of mail at mailing lists by forcing
the opening of a process for no useful reason.
Your right to free roaming ends at the point where my right
to choose freely starts.  If you don=B4t want to respect mine,
fine, but don=B4t expect me to be content nor to respect yours.
For practical purposes it performs exactly the same function:
showing that you have a public key.
Perhaps you are going through some of those days where some
ppl feel very sensitive about things.  Sorry, but I couldn=B4t
care less as you care not for what I consider to be an
Of course you don=B4t find it an annoyance!  You are the one
who annoys others with it!
You want to apply your personal view for right and wrong, and
then want to be selective about where should your view apply
and where not?  That would be fine if it didn=B4t bump on
others=B4 views.  And though it is still fine, but then don=B4t
ask others to give you what you are not willing give.

Ok, while comparisons are not always fair, sometimes can be
used as a means to make someone understanding.  Let=B4s try
this simple one:
A car horn is meant to be used for warning against and
accident.  Yet, many people make an abusive use of it.  I
hate that.  But, does it mean that I should cover my ears to
avoid hearing it?  Being able to hearing the horn when a car
is bumping into me is far more important.
I know that I=B4m left no choice but to put up with it, but at
least I have the right to complain about some people=B4s bad
mannered and uncivilized behaviour.  Obviously, neither you
nor Owen will think it is uncivilized (ok, now I=B4m back to
signatures here), since you seem to enjoy it.  Perhaps
uncivilized is a word fit for the example, but not for the
abuse of digital signatures... let=B4s just say bad mannered
and selfish.
No, just because it would strip the useless signatures as
well as the useful ones.
I=B4m not, in fact I presume there are people who are annoyed
with it and others who are not (e.g. all of you who, imo,
(ab)?use it).  I didn=B4t use "others" to mean "everyone".  As
with everything else in life, there is enough people to stand
in one side and the opposite.

And I do.  As I am sure you do recognize my right to reject
anything I dislike in life, no matter how insensitive this
may be for anyone.
You do not have to respect me nor my feelings or beliefs,
that=B4s seems to be your right.  Good, because I do not have
to respect you nor your feelings or beliefs.
This is a list which deals with the use of a cryptographic
process in many aspects, one of them being the use of digital
signatures on electronic mail.  Therefore it is
understandable that people here will use them on this list.
Which does not mean that is useful for every message posted
here.  But it is an exception list, not a rule for every ml.
Read above.
As for the rest, it seems pointless to keep discussing this
issue any further.  I can=B4t stop you excersizing your rights
and you can=B4t stop me excersizing mine, eventhough they clash
