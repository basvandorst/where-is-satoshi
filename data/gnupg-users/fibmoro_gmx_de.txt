@_subject: SmartCard v2.1 : factory reset fails 
Dear GnuPG-Users List.
I'm having trouble with resetting my smartcard version 2.1.
After posting a bug report for GnuPG Werner Koch asked me to re-post my question on this mailing list [0].
To answer his quick hint: factory-reset did unfortunately not work as I already mentioned in my original request.
Please read more for further details below. Thank you kindly for your support!
I have accidentally blocked my smartcard version 2.1 after entering AdminPIN 3
times with wrong value.
According to the link on my card provider's homepage I tried to follow the
instructions by Werner to reset the card [1].
I then get the state (gpg --card-edit; verify):
Reader ...........: Gemalto USB Shell Token V2 (78111413) 00 00
Application ID ...: D2760001240102010005000046840000
Version ..........: 2.1
Manufacturer .....: ZeitControl
Serial number ....: 0000XXXX
Name of cardholder: [not set]
Language prefs ...: de
Sex ..............: unspecified
URL of public key : [not set]
Login data .......: [not set]
Signature PIN ....: forced
Key attributes ...: rsa2048 rsa2048 rsa2048
Max. PIN lengths .: 32 32 32
PIN retry counter : 3 0 3
Signature counter : 0
Signature key ....: [none]
Encryption key....: [none]
Authentication key: [none]
General key info..: [none]
I can then successfully change the PIN as well as AdminPIN.
However, when I try to write a key to the card (gpg --edit-key xxx; keytocard) I
get a message "Error setting the Reset Code: Bad PIN".
The same issue occurs when try set a Reset Code on the card (gpg --card-edit;
admin; passwd => set the Reset Code).
In both cases I am very certain that I'm entering the correct PIN/AdminPIN as I
have also tried to execute the reset process setting different PINs or even
leaving the default PIN values multiple times.
Trying to factory reset from "gpg --card-edit" menu didn't help either.
Is my card bricked? Am I doing something wrong?
One thing I noticed is the second 0 in the "PIN retry counter" value after
reset. From [2]:
"This field saves how many tries still are left to enter the right PIN. They are
decremented whenever a wrong PIN is entered. They are reset whenever a correct
AdminPIN is entered. The first and second PIN are for the standard PIN. gpg
makes sure that the two numbers are synchronized. The second PIN is only
required due to peculiarities of the ISO-7816 standard; gpg tries to keep this
PIN in sync with the first PIN. The third PIN represents the retry counter for
the AdminPIN."
My current setup is:
gpg 2.1.15 ccid 1.4.24 pcsc-lite 1.8.20 (with udev)
Thank you kindly for your help and feedback.

Hello Yutaka,
It doesn't even get to the point where it prompts me for the Reset Code:
Here is what I do:
When try to set the reset code via "passwd => 4" it prompts me for the AdminPIN.
I enter the default AdminPIN value of "123456789" and get the message "Error setting the Reset Code: Bad PIN"
I'm 100% sure I entered AdminPIN correctly.
The same issue occurs if I set the AdminPIN manually beforehand.
gpg/card> passwd
gpg: OpenPGP card no. DXXX detected
1 - change PIN
2 - unblock PIN
3 - change Admin PIN
4 - set the Reset Code
Q - quit
Your selection? 4
Error setting the Reset Code: Bad PIN
I am sorry, I was a bit imprecise here. Please let me explain again:
I start gpg in "--edit-key" mode.
Then I select a subkey I want to move to the card by issuing command "key 1".
After the "keytocard" command it asks me where to store the key for which I choose option 1 signature key.
It then prompts me for the privat key passphrase which I enter successfully.
Now it asks me for AdminPIN. Again with default value "123456789" I get the message "gpg: KEYTOCARD failed: Bad secret key"
Also the same issue occurs if I set the AdminPIN manually beforehand.
gpg> key 1
gpg> keytocard
Please select where to store the key:
   (1) Signature key
   (3) Authentication key
Your selection? 1
gpg: KEYTOCARD failed: Bad secret key
Please let me know if you need more information.
Thank you kindly,

ok, let's do that.
You are correct. I can confirm setting the Reset Code works now. Awaiting further instructions. ;-)

Dear Yutaka,
1. Moving keys to card
Using the correct default Admin PIN value of *12345678* I could now
successfully move private keys to card, which also set the PIN retry counter
gpg/card> verify Key attributes ...: rsa4096 rsa4096 rsa4096
PIN retry counter : 3 3 3
Sofar so good.
2. Changing Admin PIN
However, one quite awkward behavior I noticed that I think caused a whole lot
confusion on my side. On a card after fresh factory-reset, the first thing I did was trying to set
Admin PIN:
gpg/card> admin
Admin commands are allowed
gpg/card> passwd
gpg: OpenPGP card no. DXXX detected
1 - change PIN
2 - unblock PIN
3 - change Admin PIN
4 - set the Reset Code
Q - quit
Your selection? 3
It then asks me to "Please enter the Admin PIN".
Now, in the believe that *123456789* was the correct default Admin PIN value,
I would enter this *wrong* value.
I am then prompted to enter "New Admin PIN" value and confirm that. Let's say I use the value *smartcardrocks*.
My change is then confirmed with;
PIN changed.
I would now be in the believe that *smartcardrocks* is the new correct Admin
However, any subsequent command that would require the Admin PIN would fail
(e.g. moving keys to card, setting reset code, changing admin pin).
For example, when I try to set a new reset code I am asked to enter the Admin
PIN. I enter *smartcardrocks* I get "Error setting the Reset Code: Bad PIN".
I enter *12345678* I also get "Error setting the Reset Code: Bad PIN".
I seems the Admin PIN is then broken and set to an "unknown" value.
Can you replicate the above described behavior?
Thank you kindly.

Dear Yutaka,
Then I'm very much relieved that my issue was confirmed. :-)
To reflect a little further, locking the smartcard (AdminPIN) is probably a rather rare event, it was actually a first time experience for me. However, considering the importance of a functioning and secure key, the process of restoring the key caused quite some trouble for me:
The first blocking point I encountered was that when reimporting the private key (subkeys) into my keyring they would be unusable as they would still refer to the keys on the blocked smartcard. To remove these "stubs" I had to manually delete the according keygrip files in ".gnupg/private-keys-v1.d". Only then would an import of the private keys work correctly.
The next challenge was to find out if and how I could actually reset my version of smartcard. Fortunately I could find the instructions by Werner Koch in a mailing list post from 2009. It was probably in this situation of stress that I entered the wrong Admin PIN of *123456789* which left me entirely confused and frustrated.
Maybe I should write a little post of "How to reset your smartcard (version > 2.1) and things that could go wrong" so the next candidates can benefit from the learning?
In any case, I would like to thank you and all the people who patiently helped me along the way to resolve this issue.
Last but not least I'd like to thank all the GnuPG developers for creating and maintaining this technology. Often I hear or read from people that GnuPG was to "hard" and "out of date".  I still consider it one of the most important tools for secure communication in our digital age. So thank you very much again for your efforts!
