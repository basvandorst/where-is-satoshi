@_subject: Use same key for S/MIME and OpenPGP 
Hi all,
I'm just curious: since a RSA public key is made mainly of just two  numbers, is it not possible (theoretically) to create both a valid  PGP key and X509 certificate using the same key information, and use  it with both protocols?
Also, is it not (theoretically) possible to convert X509 key  certificates to PGP key signatures or vice-versa, based on the  numerical values of the signing certificates/keys ?
If not, I would be interested to know what are the technical  Thanks in advance for any insight,
