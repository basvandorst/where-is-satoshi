@_subject: make check - test skipped 
First time with GnuPG. Downloaded gnupg-1.0.4.tar.gz and applied the gnupg-1.0.4.security-patch1.diff. The only flag I passed was ./configure --disable-nls. While running make check near the end of the list of PASS foo I get:
"expect" needed but not found - test skipped
Then a couple more pass foo, pass bar then:
All 24 tests passed
My question is this "expect" something I really need to have? Or is it safe and secure for me to ignore? If not, what package is it a part of?
The platform I am building on is LinuxFromScratch 2.4.3. That is, I have built my operating system from source tarballs.

Thank you,
I think, therefore, ken_i_m
