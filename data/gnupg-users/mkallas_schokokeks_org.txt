I'm using Icedove 1.5.0.9 (ex-Thunderbird) with enigmail 2:0.94.1-1
on Debian unstable here.
This is exactly the same key, it's just short or long id.
If you want to check keys, short ids are not enough as there can be
doubles. Long ids are practically unique.

Probably in a former session, gpg (or your whole PC) crashed so that

This seems to be the result of several half-correct howtos for installing
the cardreader. Recently I wanted to install it on a new machine but got
the same result. For the instant, I "solved" it by installing pcscd and
I think we need a better way for new users to install the reader, maybe a
small installation package or something similar.

@_subject: how to use gpg with a smartcard, when there is no smartcard 
This is one of the use cases where the smart card would be extremely
useful. Your secret key should never be used with a compromiseable
system. And you have no control over what this computer does when
you insert that usb stick.

I suppose that GnuPG did not move just for fun to GPLv3 but for a
reason. So if you can't comply with GNU GPL v3, better be prepared
to switch.

Short question: Why?
ISO-8859-1 is a hack and even so common alphabets like cyrillic break it.
So, if you want to stay sane, switch to UTF-8.
