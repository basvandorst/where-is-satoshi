@_subject: Use Private DOs 
Hi all,
I've discover recently the Private DO field in my OpenPGP Smart Card V2.1.
First, I try it on my Windows System and Gpg4Win 2.2.5 but I did't see
anything. Yesterday, on my Debian system I finally saw it ( Private DO
 & Now, I've got a big TEST in my field and I didn't find how to delete it.
With a blank fied, I've got an error from GPG, and I didn't find an
article about Private DOs on Internet. Just one in French but not how to
delete field or how to show field  & I've read some info in OpenPGP Card 2.1 documentation but not how to use
it with GPG. I think is a function not well documented.
Can you explain me how is it work ??

Hi all,
Recently, I've bought a PlussID (or +ID) Smartcard reader on there
website ( I bought it to use it on travel.
I receive it today and it's really, really tiny !!
But, unfortunetly it doesn't work with my OpenPGP Card 2.1 with 3 RSA
4096bits keys. I can read data on the card, I can enter my PIN but then
I can't sign, decrypt or use my any key.
What can I do to debug the smartcard reader ?? It is possible to resolve
this ??
Thanks for reply

So, the reader is an Omnikey, then I've found this:
Omnikey based readers don't work with that card because the readers
don't support Extended Length APDUs.
I've contact +ID support to know a little more about it.
It is worth nothing, this reader is very tiny and you can take it with
you everywhere (It's the size of little lighter).

I've just try on my Windows computer and it works !!!
So, It's the Omnikey linux driver... too bad :'(
Someone have something new about it ?? Make it work maybe ??

Hi Robert,
It's a great idea to update the FAQ.
I propose to explain the different key in the keyring:
- C for Certify. This key certify all other key in your keyring
- E for Encrypt. It's use for encryption/decryption. Be aware with
encryption subkey.
- S for Sign. This key is use for sign document, message, file, etc...
- A for Authentification. You can use this key to authentificate your
self to a server/desktop (SSH, PAM)
And some subtilities with subkeys, like you should always have a backup
on your encryption subkey. Because GnuPG use the lastest key for
encrypt, and even if you have an encryption key in your master key, you
couldn't decrypt it because it was encrypted with you lastest key, your

@_subject: Question about getting started with PGP and smart cards 
Hi Josh,
I used my OpenPGP SmartCard [1] since last year and It works very well.
You're right when you say all decrypting/signing is on the device, but
you have to know it's little slower than when private key is on disk.
You can bought one on FSFE but it's more expensive [2]
Another thing to know, if you generate your key on the card, you have NO
WAY TO BACKUP IT !!! So a common thing to do, it's to generate your
master key from LiveUSB (Tails for exemple), generate your subkey and
copy to your smart card. Don't forget to backup your master key. [3]
About the smartcard reader, it's your choice of level security. I've
choosen standard USB PC/SC Gemalto or small +ID reader [4]. With this, I
have to enter my PIN on my computer with Pinentry. Other want physical
reader to enter the pin for better security.
On Windows, it's very easy with GPG4Win to use or configure the card.
Everything on Windows is made to make things easier. But on Linux is not
so easy. You have to install all needed depencies for the reader (pcscd)
and sometimes Gnome Keyring will make harder to make it work [5].
In conclusion, I love my card but I have always my reader with me. Is
not very simple for day-to-day use and I waiting FS-BB48 [6] from NIIBE
to switch to full USB device.

I've made my master key on a computer offline and then use addcardkey
command to add subkey on my card. I don't have backup and you say that
if I lost my card I lost my encrypt file ?? So why people use subkey ??
Maybe only for people who have his key sign by other... :(
I love GnuPG and crypto, but it's hard to find good information on it

OK I've test it just to be sure, and you were right !! I need my
smartcard event if my master key is in my keyring.
So, what is the best to do ?? Restard my masterkey from scratch (nobody
sign my key...) or delete my subkey on my card and copy my new subkey
like you said ??
PS: I store my Master key on tail too and thinking to print it with
PS2: I can do the same with my authentication key, because if my key is
compromise, my SSH server don't know it ! Right?

Thanks Andrew and Peter for your advice.
Of course it is my old encryption key and have data encrypted with it,
but there is not a lot file (maybe except for pass* :-/ )
I will thinking how to procede, backup masterkey before begin and hope I
haven't forget encrypted data...
I haven't heard about monkeysphere but I've found website so I will
study it :)
Thanks for every thing :D

encryption key and I can't decrypt it with my Smartcard.
So I thinking what is the best to do next:
- Delete my useless first subkey encryption from my keyring and send
update to key server.
- Recreate a new master key with only cert role and create all my subkey
(S E A) and copy it to my Smart Card.
What your advice on it ?? Nobody have sign my key and I can rencrypt my

I've previously report my problem too but I don't have any reply yet !!
I've already revoke my encryption key on my smartcard, thanks to you and
it works like a charm. (like I said in my previous mail :) ).
And I didn't know if you delete a subkey you won't delete it on key
server. Thx Again Andrew. You are an incredible source of GPG knowledge
You were right !! Bad idea ^_^
Thanks all again !! Maybe I will revoke my first encryption key. It's on
my offline Master key so I will not use it day-to-day. And recreate my
master key is not a good idea.
Last question: Clean option will only clean locally or on key server too ??
