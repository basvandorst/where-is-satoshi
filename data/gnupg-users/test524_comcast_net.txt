@_subject: Truncated file in GPG? 
Hello all,
I'm running GPG version 1.0.6 on Debian stable for the first time. Kernel version is 2.4.18. (I sent this to the Debian mailing list, but didn't get a response--I'm not sure it is Debian specific.) I'm trying to perform a relatively simple task: encrypt a big MS Outlook mail archive file so that only I can decrypt it. I created a key for myself, and encrypted the file with
gpg -e -r Charles mail.pst
mail.pst is a 116MB file.
The resulting mail.pst.gpg is 80MB. Something is clearly wrong. Though I'm aware GPG has compression, .PST is already a pretty compressed format. Doing gpg -d to decrypt gave me back a file that was about 81MB
