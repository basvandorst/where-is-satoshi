@_subject: one more question: is there a way to use additional keyring 
i wish to use additional keyring from USB stick, (i have keys on .gnupg
folder on my stick),
but i have troubles, here is my gpg.conf (from ~/.gnupg)
keyserver random.sks.keyserver.penguin.de
default-cert-check-level 3
keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve include-revoked include-subkeys
keyring /media/USB/.gnupg/secring.gpg   << this is the new line i wrote
but in thunderbird i still have no access to my key from stick
probably i did something wrongly

@_subject: one more question: is there a way to use additional keyring 
i used secret-keyring /media/USB/.gnupg/secring.gpg and everything worked fine,
but now enigmail does not recognize ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg as default seckeyring
even with this solution i am satisfied, but still i wander is there a way to set additional seckeying from USB stick
thanx for interest
