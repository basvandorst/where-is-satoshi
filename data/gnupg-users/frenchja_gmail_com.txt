@_subject: Multiple Instances of gpg-agent 
Hash: SHA1
Despite having near identical configurations between my work and home
iMacs, I've noticed that at home it's not unusual to see 15 to 30
instances of gpg-agent processes open. I've been unable to remedy the
situation, probably caused by my home iMac being around longer and
suffering from multiple installs of GPGMail
MacGPG, MacGPG2, and Enigmail.
My understanding is that it retains secret keys. Is there anyway to
find out what keeps invoking so many instances of gpg-agent? I was
unable to find anything in the email archives.
I'm on OS X 10.5.8 running Thunderbird 3.0 with Enigmail 1.0. Thanks
in advance.
