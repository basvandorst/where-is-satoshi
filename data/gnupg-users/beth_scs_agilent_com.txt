@_subject: Compiling gpg for HPUX -- __udiv_qrnnd unsatisfied 
I'm trying to compile gunpg-1.0.2 for HPUX.  I have installed gnu make.
Many things seem to compile, but eventually it runs into the error:
Making all in tools
make[2]: Entering directory `/home/beth/src/outside/gnupg-1.0.2/tools'
gcc  -g -O2 -Wall  -o mpicalc  mpicalc.o ../cipher/libcipher.a                ..
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
   __udiv_qrnnd (code)
Does anyone on this list know what the problem might be?

I tried that and it didn't work (gave the same error).  Some poking
around reveals that there is a directory mpi/hppa/ and mpi/hppa1.1.
These directories contain assembly files (.S) for the __udiv_qrnnd
code.   Do you know how I can tell configure to use that code?
One of the things configure tells me is:
Invalid configuration `-hp-hpux10.20': machine `-hp' not recognized
Thanks for the help!
