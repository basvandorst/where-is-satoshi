@_subject: GPG create key in batch mode 
I tripped on something and was wondering if anyone else was aware of this. When the --create-key is called in --batch mode and --homedir is specified to point to the keyring, gpg wipes the key ring and places the new key in there. Does anyone know of this issue?
Example: This is my key data
Key-Type: DSA
Key-Length: 1024
Subkey-Type: ELG-E
Subkey-Length: 1024
Name-Real: $KeyName
Name-Comment: Generated by BERC
%pubring c:/gnupg/pubring.gpg
%secring c:/gnupg/secring.gpg
Expire-Date: 3000d
Passphrase: $PassPhrase
This case my key ring is in c:/gnupg/. Any idea.
