@_subject: encrypting and replacing 
Hi. I am looking for a gpg command and option that for exmaple, when a .txt
file is encrypted and its encrypted .gpg file is written, the .txt should be
auotmatically deleted from disk, i.e. the .txt file should be replaced  by
the .gpg file.
I would appreciate it if anyone could give me a solution to this problem.
