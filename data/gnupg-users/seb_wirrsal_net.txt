@_subject: Efail or OpenPGP is safer than S/MIME 
I notice that the command currently succeeds, albeit with a warning.
Would it make sense to have GnuPG return a non-zero exit code in case
some MUA does not parse these warnings, or in case it does parse them
but proceeds to use the result?
Alternatively, perhaps invoking gpg for decryption could honor some
command-line switch or gpg.conf option to turn some or all warnings into
hard errors.
Kind regards,
