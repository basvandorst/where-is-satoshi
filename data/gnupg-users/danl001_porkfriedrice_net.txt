@_subject: clarification on automated signing 
I need to do some automated signing in a script so I read the "How can I use GnuPG in an automated environment?" section of the FAQ at
I have a few questions. So I start by creating a keypair the usual way using --gen-key and then add an additional signing subkey. Then I export   the secret keys using --export-secret-keys > secring.auto
The FAQ answer then says to copy secring.auto and pubring.gpg to a test directory. Do I need to rename secring.auto to secring.gpg? If i don't, gpg just creates a 0 length secring.gpg file anyway. I can remove the passphrase with passwd, but which keys should I actually delete? I only want to have the subkey installed on the target machine, right? How do I do this?
It then says to copy secring.auto to the target machine and "install" it as the secret key ring. What exactly does install mean here? Do I need to rename it to secring.gpg? Also, do I need to copy over pubring.gpg with it?
If someone could clarify the process of setting things up for automated signing, I'd appreciate it. Thanks.
