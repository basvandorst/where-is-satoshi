@_subject: a minimal version of PGP/GPG for the Win32/64 bits for command line 
Hello!I need a GPG/PGP version running from the command line for Win32/64 bits.Something like PGP5i.I wanted to generate a pair of keys and send someone a gpg.exe/pgp.exe + public key, so that he could encrypt a file without any installation PGP/GPG and send it to me.What do you propose?RegardsJanek
