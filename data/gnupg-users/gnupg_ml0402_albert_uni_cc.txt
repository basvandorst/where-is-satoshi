Thanks, but it didn't work the first time with subkeys.pgp.net. So I checked the manpage and found:
"the  keyserver "hkp://subkeys.pgp.net" uses round robin DNS to give a different keyserver each time you use it.
So why there are different "qualities" of keyservers? Which one would you recommend to use in Europe?

Hmmh, as posted "hkp://subkeys.pgp.net" uses round robin DNS and therefore you don't ask the same server always. I think that this was the reason why I found the key the 2nd time and the 1st time not, since I didn't query the same server.

Hi Holger,
sorry for my late reply, I had a hd-crash.
I have no idea, if anything in the chain does this. As mentioned I use mail/nail to send from a shell-script.
It did and I changed from DE to EN. Antivir is an example of the problem and I think a lot of people use it, so they can test this themselves. If a programm doesn't support a language setting you will get a lot problems. It was not a good idea for me to use "locales" in the script.
Of course.
I tried this and it worked fine with german chars, when the script was started _manually_, but no chance to get it work with a How do I deactivate this auto-conversion temporarily for a single Your private mails in German are welcome, but I answered to the list, hoping that anyone of the developers gets aware of this

I have to return a new hard drive in warranty and to delete a lot of directories which contain private data. Unfortunately the data of S.M.A.R.T are erased too, if I use badblocks -w to overwrite the _whole_ drive.
I know there is a possibility to shredder a file with gpg, but not a directory. What do you recommend?

I use SuSE 9.1 and when I install KGPG there is an option to install a shredder (Rei?wolf, german) and it looks like it works.
shred doesn't work with directories and has problems with ext3 and reiser. Any other ideas? Are you all returning your harddrives with files on it :-)

That deletes the smart-info too, which means you have problems to prove the errors. The best way I found is badblocks -w /dev/hdx_1_, which writes 4 different patterns over the partition. But I am unsure if there isn't a smarter way.

Indeed, this should be, but I heard, that you will loose the smart-log with drives from Samsung.
To get a RMA-no. from Maxtor, you need an error key and for a brand new drive you won't remap the sectors and wait till the next error

--list-keys [names] doesn't work with filenames, but maybe there is a solution with a pipe?

Good question. But it is not my problem. There is nobody who has access to my secret keys.
I think this is a general problem. Whose keys one can sign, is very difficult to decide IMO.
Of course people won't tell you, that there is an admin who has access to their secret-keys and I believe there are a lot of people who don't know that the admin has access to the secret keys. What do you think are people doing in networks, where they are users only and not admins? I don't believe that they do not save the secret keys on the harddisk in their personal directory. Since I am the only person who has root-rights on the machine, where my secret keys are stored, I never thought about it, but what can people in companys do to keep their sec-keys secret? I am talking of reality and not what one can do in theory. A lot of people are so lazy and they don't care about passwords. Maybe it is an idea, that they don't sign, but do encryptions only.
Yesterday a friend told me, that there will a service be setup to increase the use of e-government, where a telecommunication company stores the secret keys and does the encryption for you, if you enter a 4digit code in a webform, which you receive on your mobile phone by request. This decision was made, because a lot of people have no idea, how to sign or encrypt a message, have card reader, a.s.o. I hope this system will not be accepted.
BTW do you know how many persons have registered a key?
 report about 2000000 keys.  That seems to be nothing compared to the amount of internet Are you sure?
Generally other people are not interested in stealing your secret key, but let's assume again, the owner of an internet cafe is interested in your secret key.
Doesn't have the admin/root access to all data used on a machine? Let's say the key is used from a floppy or an usb-stick. In a linux environment you have to mount the floppy / usb-stick and then the keys are readable to root. I think of a simple shell script that checks if the media is mounted and if, the content ist copied.
IMO it ends everytime in the question "can I trust them", if it is not my own machine.
This assumption I hope is wrong. I don't know if they ignored what I told them, but I think they have a valuable password.
BTW, I am searching for a linux-programm who tries to decrypt a gpg-file by brute-force attack to show people how important it is to have a good password. I would like to show them, how long it takes to find a password of 1, 2, 3 a.s.o letters or a simple word like rose.

@_subject: Different fingerprints on different servers - general problem? 
Sorry, for spam reasons, I am not willing to make the email-adresses public, but I found out, that  reports other fingerprints than sks-servers, if a RSA-key was created first and an El-Gamal-subkey was added. It could be also, that it happens only if the key is larger than 1024. In this case a RSA key of 2048 was created and an El-Gamal-key of 4096. If it makes sense to use such large keys is another question.
SKS-servers show the same fingeprint than locally, so IMO keyserver.net is a bad choice for checking fingerprints.

This charset problem drives me crazy sometimes. Now I use SuSE 9.1 with default-charset utf-8, but it happened with SuSE 8.2 and iso-8859-15 too.
Assume you made a shell-script (bash) to create a virus report with If you run the script manually everything works fine, if the script is started by a cron job KMail says, that there is an invalid I used the following:
ANTIVIROPTIONS="-s -v -z --allfiles -e -ren -dmdel -dmdas -r1 \
-rf$LOG_FILE_ANTIVIR -ra -lang=DE"
If I change to lang=EN everything is fine.
cat $LOG_FILE_SUMMARY \
--quiet --charset utf-8 --textmode --clearsign --trusted-key \ "$LONGKEYID" \
So every time, when an umlaut is in the output the signature is invalid if the script is started by a cronjob, but the same script works fine, if it is started manually.
