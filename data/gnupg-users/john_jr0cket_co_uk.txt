@_subject: How to create an authinfo.gpg encrypted file with a GitHub token 
Hello everyone,
I would like to store a GitHub personal access token in a file called
~/.authinfo.gpg so that the token is not stored unencrypted on my
computer.  This file would be used by Emacs to talk to GitHub via its API.
I have never used GnuPGP before, although I have gnupg2 installed on Ubuntu
After many searches, I have not found any information on how to do this.  I
am looking through the documentation on the  website, but
its unclear where to start reading.
Thank you
