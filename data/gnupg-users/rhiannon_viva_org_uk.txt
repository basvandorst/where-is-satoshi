@_subject: Gnupg stopped working after being moved to new host 
Our host (Cedant) was bought out by Aplus so we have been moved to their new super-snazzy servers.
Unfortunately the encrypted emails with credit card information which are sent through to our shop for staff to process are all coming through blank.
Do you know which files I need to change to get it working again? I've changed these:
The host does have Gnupg installed
Many Thanks

@_subject: PHP website  
After moving servers I was having trouble with GnuPG so I generated a new set of keys in my own name. They work in the command line:
gpg --encrypt -ao encrypteddata -r rhiannon at viva.org.uk data
But not in my PHP code.
Are there any PHP geniuses out there?
This is the bit that doesn't work at all (errors listed below).
