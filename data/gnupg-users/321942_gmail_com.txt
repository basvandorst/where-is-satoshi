Well, I?m glad to hear that, but it?s really a pity, that supporting Autocrypt does not make sense for you.
A double pity in light of your decision to not only support but actually _prefer_ other cryptoformats over PGP whenever possible for the sake of ?forward secrecy? [1] ? that?s when Autocrypt is exactly the extension to PGP that can provide forward secrecy, if needed.

A long awaited news indeed!
Pity, but I hope it will be better that way.  In particular I hope, that Mozilla will not follow your example and won?t entice users to proprietary isolated keyserver [0] instead of distributed SKS network thus splitting the keybase.  And won?t promote standards [1] that suspiciously resemble embrace-extend-and-extinguish tactics employed against PGP either.
