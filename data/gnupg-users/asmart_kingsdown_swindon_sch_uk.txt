Whats the current state of play with keyservers and spammers? Is it technically possible for them to harvest addresses from keyservers, and does anybody know if its a problem?
Xmas wishes

Hash: SHA1
I've read the documentation I have, and I'm still not sure about this one.
I use gnupg at home and at work, with two different key pairs 'tied' to
two different email addresses.
Sometimes I post to newsgroups at home which, normally, I'd sign with my
work sig. Can I have both keypairs on my home machine? If I can, how to
I take a copy of my work keypair to my home pc

I once asked an American friend when the US was going to metricate - his reply was "When Hell freezes over buddy"; as a result of 4 years in the UK he was convinced metric was easier but said that he couldn't see any reason for the US to change :-)
