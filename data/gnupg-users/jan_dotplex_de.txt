I've just reproduced the issue with scdaemon logging on. Please find
the console input in log2.txt and the scdaemon1.log attached.
Thanks, Jan-Kaspar

Thanks for looking at the log!
It does work on on Linux and it did on earlier versions of Mac OS. But it doesn't work with 10.8 (tried it with two Macs).
So is there anything I can do?
