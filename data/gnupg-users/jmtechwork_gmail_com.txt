@_subject: Hard to find alternate source of checksums 
For a fresh install of GnuPG, I was following the integrity check
directions. I have no prior version for GnuPG.
They read "...find the announcement on several other websites and make
sure the checksum is consistent." This task is difficult to accomplish
using search engines such a DuckDuckGo or Google. The search terms
that yielded the best results were merely the full file name enclosed
in double quotes.
I eventually found an alternate source of the checksums solely from
search results for all files except "ntbtls-0.1.2.tar.bz2", oddly. I'm
not sure what makes that one special. Also, I felt I was relying too
much on  as my alternate source.
Do you have any specific tips for how to find alternate checksum sources?

I'm not on Linux. I'm on macOS, which does not come with any built-in
GPG. I must build GPG from source files. The only way to verify the
source files in this situation (I think) is by checksum.

You have hit the heart of my problem. I cannot find these 2 or 3 different sites
That is why I came to this mailing list: for hints on how to find
these other sites.
My DDG & Goole searches were not enough.
