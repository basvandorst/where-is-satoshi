@_subject: using an OpenPGP card with Java (keytool and jarsigner) 
Scute works great with Firefox, but keep in mind it requires gpg-agent (or
at least scdaemon). AFAIK it's not intended to work with anything other
than Firefox right now. I've been meaning to try it out with wpa_supplicant
and openvpn, so please let us know if you get it to work with anything
other than Firefox!
The code seems fairly straightforward and it comes with documentation for
spying on the PKCS calls to help troubleshoot the implementation, so
even if it doesn't work it may not require too much hacking to make it

Scute accesses the card via either scdaemon or gpg-agent (I can't remember
which and I'm on my phone), so you don't need to release the card and
reenter your PIN to switch back and forth between PKCS and gpg/gpgsm.
However, it's a minimal implementation of the parts of the API necessary
for X.509 auth in Firefox, so I have no idea what else it might work for in
its present state. I plan to try it with OpenVPN pretty soon.
