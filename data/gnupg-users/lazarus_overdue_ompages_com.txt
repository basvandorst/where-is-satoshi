Sorry to differ here. (the word "all")
I've had to create new UIDs in the past, due to temporary email
addresses and a variety of other situations.  Many times I have desired
to *not*-change the primary UID or to change it to one that is not the
most-recently-created.  In an ideal world, I would have the option of
specifying this.
Do I consider this a show-stopper problem with GnuPG?  Not at all. :-)
But it definitely can be a frustration for the person wrestling with this.
