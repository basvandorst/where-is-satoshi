Are there any detailed installation/operating instructions
for Windows platform?  I've downloaded the software,
unzipped it,
and tried running the gpg.exe file.
It would be nice to see the prompt listing the 4 options
shown in the handbook.
Instead it came back with:
"Go ahead and type your message ..."
It seems to accept typing input, but I don't see how to
terminate the
message.
