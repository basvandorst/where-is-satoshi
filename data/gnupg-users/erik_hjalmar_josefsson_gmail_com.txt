@_subject: "no valid subkey" 
Hash: SHA1
Dear all,
This might not be the best place for beginners to ask for help, but the
reason I subscribed is that icedove says I have "no valid subkey" to my
two registered email addresses:
Further, a friend told me that his key-manager won't let him encrypt to
one of them.
A pointer to a beginners "how to" fix this would be much appreciated.
Best regards.
