@_subject: gpg writes junk forever when decrypting 
I think I've hit a bug in gpg. When I try and decrypt a corrupt pgp file, it looks like it is working but when it hits the corrupt part of the file, I see this error pop up:
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: block_filter 0x80e8ac0: read error (size=11072,a->size=27456)
gpg: block_filter 0x80e8a98: read error (size=14947,a->size=39523)
When this error pops up, gpg goes out of control and starts appending junk to the decrypted file and never stops appending junk.
I've let it sit up to 50GB before I killed gpg. The original file is only about 1GB but I wanted to see if it would ever stop. I've looked around but I didn't see anyone else who had this problem and resolved it.
I could verify the signature prior to attempting to decrypt the file but the file isn't signed.
Any suggestions? Any workaround? Anyone else have this problem?

Hello Henry,
Thank You for doing the test. Can you send me a public key? If you sent me a public key, I could have the specific person encrypt sample data. I can then purposely damage the file to see if you could reproduce the problem.

If you were able to encrypt a file and then you listed the keys and found none then perhaps you are using an incorrect key ring. You should check to make sure you are using the right keyring or you should just use "--home" and specify the exact location.
