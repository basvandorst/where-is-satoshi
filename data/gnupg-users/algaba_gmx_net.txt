I've tried to compile the doc of pgp in format .sgml.
I've failed to do it. Some docbook stylesheet are the problem.
I have sgmltools, openjade, jade, ...
I've even dowloaded DSSL for docbooks but now the problem is:
openjade:/usr/local/lib/docbook/print/docbook.dsl:267:0:E: notation
"DSSSL" for entity "dblib.dsl" undefined
openjade:/usr/local/lib/docbook/print/docbook.dsl:183:0:E: notation
"DSSSL" for openjade:c1.sgml:587:18:E: element "SCREEN" undefined
openjade:c1.sgml:588:7:E: element "PROMPT" undefined
openjade:c1.sgml:588:37:E: element "USERINPUT" undefined
openjade:c1.sgml:601:5:E: element "PARA" undefined
openjade:c1.sgml:606:22:E: element "LINK" undefined
BTW,what happened with traditional sgml-linux ?
