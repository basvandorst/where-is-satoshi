Recently the German Privacy Foundation released the open source Crypto
The GPF Crypto Stick is a USB stick in a small form factor containing an
integrated OpenPGP smart card to allow easy and high-secure encryption
e.g. of e-mail or for authentication in network environments. As opposed
to ordinary software solutions, private keys are always inside the
Crypto Stick so that their exposure is impossible. All cryptographic
operations (precisely: decryption and signature because of public key
cryptography) are executed on the PIN-protected Crypto Stick. In case
the Crypto Stick was stolen, got lost, or is used on a
virus-contaminated computer (e.g. Trojan horse) no attacker is able to
access the private keys so that all encrypted data stays secure.
The Crypto Stick is developed as a non-profit open source project and
ensures a very high level of security due to verifiability and an
attractive price. The open interface of the used OpenPGP smart card
allows optimal compatibility with various software applications (e.g.
GnuPG, Mozilla Thunderbird + Enigmail, OpenSSH, Linux PAM, OpenVPN,
Mozilla Firefox).

The Online Shop is currently in German only. Please mail me if you want
to purchase a Crypto Stick and have trouble placing the order.

Each of the three keys can be up to 3072 bit. In fact they can even be
4096 bit long; but GnuPG does currently not support such key length in
cooperation with the Crypto Stick (but GnuPG can handle 4096 bit
soft-keys without the Crypto Stick).

Currently we are developing the next version which will contain more
- hardware encrypted storage
- simple HTML- and text-file-interfaces providing OpenPGP functionality
without any software requirement
- many more...

@_subject: How secure are smartcards? 
The very purpose of smartcards is to keep secret keys confidential and
secure. This is achieved by physical protection, different layers,
puzzling structure etc. This makes it very, very difficult to extract
the keys. For a state-of-the-art smart card like the OpenPGP Card 2, I
guess the price tag would be around 100.000 Euros.
The beauty is that this protection can be provided without the burden
for the user to remember a long passphrase, since this is not required
to encrypt the keys.

@_subject: [gpgtools-devel] Joint OpenPGP (JS) implementation 
I'm just wondering if unhosted.org could be an interesting and easy to
implement storage backend for OpenPGP.js. It's advantage is that the
keys could be stored at a different server resp. service provider than
the web application is hosted.

Hi Luis, sorry for the late reply.
You need an appropriate UDEV rule. On Debian you can install the
following package:
Alternatively and on other systems you might copy the following UDEV
rule to the directory /etc/udev/rules.d

Hi Gabriel!
Before you can use any smart card, you need to store your keys on the
smart card. Which card are you using?

@_subject: Any future for the Crypto Stick? 
Regarding the initial question, the Crypto Stick is under active
development and we are working to make the Crypto Stick available again.
Here I'm posting a short status overview published at
In the recent weeks we got increasing questions on the status and future
of the project. Other than our website might indicate, we are
continuously developing but we should do better in order to keep you
updated. Now, let's give you an overview:
You may have noticed that the Crypto Stick is out of stock for a while
already. We are working on a new device (think of it as a version 1.4)
which super seeds the current Crypto Stick. To achieve better robustness
the integrated smart card won't be soldered anymore but be inserted. The
device will contain a new OATH (not OAuth) one-time-password feature
which is the same standard used by the Google Authenticator. This device
enables you to securely and easily login to popular websites like Amazon
Web Services, DropBox, GMail, GDocs etc. without entering a password.
Furthermore the Crypto Stick will have a smaller and custom-made casing.
The long-awaited Crypto Stick "version 2" containing an encrypted
storage is still under development. We shipped a few devices as part of
a closed beta program and we are currently investigating a bug (
which occasionally prevents the device from starting up properly,
primarily under Linux. For this purpose we did setup a test- and
metering-installation and run test scripts to nail the problem down. The
error seems to occur only once in a few thousand startup cycles which
doesn't make life easier for us. There are a few more things to do and
you may want to follow the progress in our ticketing system.
Furthermore we plan to release a Crypto Stick "light" without a smart
card and without storage. It will be based on GNUK which is a
software-only implementation of the OpenPGP Card which is executed by
the STM32 microprocessor.
Eventually all three flavors will be available in parallel to address
different demands. Now you may be interested to know when the new
devices will be ready. Since our earlier estimations were wrong, we
won't comment on specific release dates anymore. The "version 1.4" with
the one-time-password feature is available as "series zero" which means
we have 20 devices to currently undergo intensive testing. Unless
significant bugs are found, the next step would be to release the device
and start the production.
Because of some pending work items the "version 2" (with storage) may
take a while to be released for production. Please subscribe to this
newsletter or blog where we will announce any news and releases.
