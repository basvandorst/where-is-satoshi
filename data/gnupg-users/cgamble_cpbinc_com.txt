@_subject: GPG compatibility to PGP 6.0 or above 
I work with a small company that needs to receive encrypted files from a vendor. The vendor is specifying that the public key that we provide them be compatible with PGP 6.0 and above which i assume means using the IDEA algorithm.
Does PGP 6.0 or above mean it uses the proprietary IDEA algorithm, and can pgp work with this (unfortunately in accordance with USA laws)? If so, are there java or COM components we can use to help build a service that decrypts these files?
