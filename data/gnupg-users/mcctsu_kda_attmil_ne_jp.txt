Maybe this is kind of a stupid question, but... I've got GnuPG installed,
and thanks to Frank Tobin's GnuPG Interface Perl module I can do encryption
through CGI, and it is all working pretty smoothly. However, I am worried
about how the data from my form are handled in the CGI before they are
encrypted. Are the unencrypted data stored in any temp files, memory, cache,
etc. is such a way that other people sharing my web server can access them?
If so, are there GnuPG commands that can prevent it?
Thanks in advance for any help,

@_subject: GnuPG::Interface 
I was using GnuPG through a CGI script using GnuPG::Interface, but after
replacing my test recipient key with actual recipient keys, I don't get any
output from the CGI. The keys work from a telnet command line ex.
"gpg --homedir /home/tsupac/keys -aer library@ so the
new keys seem to be ok. My script, which is basically cut and pasted from
the GnuPG::Interface documentation is below. It worked before, now it
doesn't. I've tried tweeking it with little changes about 100 times with no
success. If anyone can think of why it doesn't work, I would appreciate your

I've been able to encrypt messages using Telnet commands, but when I try to
run GPG using a Perl script through CGI, it doesn't work. I've already seen
the message posted on this list about using a PGP module to work in CGI
( But is using a PGP
module the only way to get GnuPG to work through CGI? Can't it be done with
an ordinary Perl script?

@_subject: GnuPG::Interface 
My Web host installed GnuPG and GnuPG::Interface. I generated some keys and
wrote a script that encrypts data using GnuPG::Interface commands.
Permissions were set by my Web host so that Gnu can be run by user nobody
through CGI. I also used GnuPG::Interface to send stderr to a variable for
printing any error messages. The script runs perfectly through Telnet, but
not through CGI. Through CGI, the script runs but returns no encrypted data
and no error messages. Does anyone know why this would happen or where to
start looking for the source of the problem?
