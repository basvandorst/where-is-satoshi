@_subject: How do I read this stuff? 
When I check the signatures on my key there are several indicators which
I can't find described anywhere:  Between the sig! and the key ID there
are 1,2 or 3 on the left & right; sometimes a P and/or N perhaps others
notations as well.  Where do I find a description of what each of these
mean?  How do I read this stuff?
Command> check
sig!3        561D5E6F 2004-09-01  [self-signature]
sig!       1 633F6D07 2004-12-17  Robert Golovniov
sig!1   P    C521097E 2004-10-23  Robot CA

@_subject: gpg-agent doesn't remember passphrase 
Had the same problem in Debian-- plus other problems too,
Thunderbird-enigmail broke (can't see all uid's).  Mine haven't fixed
themselves (yet).
In article <2003596.PEJsFSjTCn Tristan
Rebooted the system, and now suddenly everything works again.  Strange.

@_subject: Signing Multiple Files 
Having looked through much documentation & some trial and error; it seems there is no way to sign (detached) multiple files.  I need to sign dozens (or hundreds) of photos at a time.  I am *not* a programmer.
I did coble together a (Linux) script:
for i in $( ls ); do
gpg -b $i
There must be a better way, but this will sign everything in a folder. I don't code enough to be able to tell the file browser to sign multiple selected files recursively.
Am I missing something obvious here?

@_subject: gpg: invalid item `BZIP2' in preference string 
I compiled both the stock 1.4.11 & the Ubuntu 1.4.10.  Both ways I get
the following error:
$ gpg --gen-key
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.10; Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
gpg: invalid item `BZIP2' in preference string
gpg: invalid default preferences
gpg: invalid item `BZIP2' in preference string
gpg: invalid personal compress preferences
I have never seen this with any distro binary, just this source (as I'm
changing from 4096 to 8192 bit)
I know the message is coming from gpg.conf, but that's a very normal
thing to have in gpg.conf.
Any idea what's going on here?

Pretty simple:
Receiving messages with GPG 2.0.14 (Ubuntu Maverick, via Mint Linux):
When messages to multiple recipients have the key ID's thrown, gpg-agent
(?) sequentially requests passwords for all secret key many, many, many
times, but fails to decrypt with any key---even the correct one.
