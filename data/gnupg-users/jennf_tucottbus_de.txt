One more question: is it a bug in the creation of the revocation certificate
or is it in applying it?  I.e. is my revocation certificate valid?
Thanks for your help!

Hi everyone!
As I have an old PGP5 key lying around which I do not use and don't want to
be used, I generated a revocation certificate.  This worked well (about
which I'm happy, for I do not want to install also PGP5 on my machine).  Of
course, I first wanted to test it myself (after backing up my keyring)...
`gpg --import < certificate'  did produce some promising output:
gpg: key 3D887E44: revocation certificate imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:    new key revocations: 1
Yet I'm still able to encrypt to this key and `gpg --with-colon --list-keys'
doesn't show `r' in the second field (according to doc/DETAILS).
This also happens with a ``genuine GPG'' key and if try it with another
user importing the certificate.
I'm using GPG 1.0.0.
Am I doing something wrong?
BTW:  It is nowhere clearly stated that you have to use --import to apply
the certificate.  Using just `gpg < certificate' results in ``Detached
signature / Please enter file name'' which is a bit confusing.  Some
hint in the man page / gph would help IMHO.
Besides this, gpg served me well all the time and I'm very thankful for
Thanks in advance,
