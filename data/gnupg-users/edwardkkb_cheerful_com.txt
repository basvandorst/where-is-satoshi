@_subject: Cygwin problems make/configure settings for GnuPG 1.0.6? 
Hallo + Guten Tag,
I have been trying to play around with the sources via Cygwin to better understand GPG and faced with some wierd problems. Running through the FAQ/Mail archives/Google, I know this question have been asked before but I cannot find any complete answer on how to make/config GnuPG using Cygwin anywhere.
(Err....From what I can gather from this mailing list archives) there are issues/questions like :
- need to add libipc to makefiles?
- Werner mentioned to use cipher/rndw32.c, but where/how to modify the correct files such that rndw32.c is used?
- Werner also mentioned the entropy of the random number in Windoze, is this resolved satisfactorily?
- There was a need to removed the keyword "function" from in-front of the function names for configuration to continue. Is it still needed?
- cygwin.dll -- Is it still needed? where to get it? how to use it?
- There are also a collection of work-arounds, the need to create symbolic links of files and the need to point config/make to the actual location of  files. Have anyone managed to get GPG to work using Cygwin?
Ohmmm....I guess enlightenment don't come easy. Thank you for any help/hints/advice/URL (to a HowTo would be nice :-)) you can offer.
Prost aus Singapore,

@_subject: A Key-gen-config file that autodeletes? 
Hi folks,
Is there any way to have gpg use a configuration file (semi-colon separated list?) to get the necessary information -- name;email;comment;cipher choice; key length; expiry date; and passphrase. And then rm/shred the configuration files automatically?
Willing to discuss.

Hmmm....it did not work as I do not know the format to pass in the correct information for gpg to be able to automate the action.
Is there a default format? I tried with a semi-colon separated list -- eg. "1;1024;1m;My Name; myname my and it does not work.
The error I  receive : --
gpg: -:1: missing colon
Anyone can enlighten me? :-)

Actually I was also considering about shred'ing the config file. :-)
(A tot just occured, how about read-once device that self destruct afterwards....too much movies :-))
But the format of the config file (to be pass in) is yet to be determine, oh?

Hi folks,
It is good to hear such learned opinions. Being a relative newbie to these
open source projects,
it does looks to me that a decision probably have to made regarding this
feature of supporting some sort of auto-capabilities.
On the other hand, I am in computer technology just long enough to know that
the answer is not going to be without trade-offs. :-|
As long as there is no guarantee that the hardware is secure, any software
decisions is hard to make.
And the classic saying, "security is only as good as its weakest link"
Also, this conversation have taken us away from my original concern of
automating the passing in of interactive parameters.
(assuming its a 'secure' computer)
- How to get "--batch" to work in either command line or scripting support?
- or If "--batch" is the option to use to pass in a config file in the first
Here is Werner's original suggestion:
gpg --gen-key --batch <$1
rm $1
Which did not work for me, as I am not sure of the data format that will be
Best regards,

Jep. My fault. I should have rtfm. :-P
I actually when to download the the whole tar ball, unzipped it, and crawled through the source to discover that there is a function read_parameter_file(...) in keygen.c which will parse/accept the format stated by Ingo.
Thank you, folks.

G'day mate,
Good for you. Though I do wonder what is happening to Hague Accord? Did it fell through? International patent recognition is a highly controversial thingie.
:-) Until the good folks in Europe wakes up (over there the time is 5am as compare to Perth time of 11am). You may want to try this link:

@_subject: Possible to check a key identity/information before --import? 
I could not see a way for me to check a key's identity and other information before I import the key into my key ring. Is this possible or must a --import happen first before I can check its information (fingerprint, user name, email, etc.etc.)?
Just me,

@_subject: Trusted-key KEYID? 
Hi again,
I managed to get a KEYID (5th field) via the "gpg --list-key --with-colon" and use it like the --help file recommended:
gpg --trusted-key 1234567890ABCDEF
AND it ask me for a message, after I type in something and press ctrl-D, it tells me "no valid OpenPGP data found".
Arrgggg.....what is wrong? Warum ist dis? :-P

@_subject: Good old Trust 
I have set a friend's public key to be fully trusted via the (long way :-) of) "--edit-key", then"trust", then "4" (trust fully).
And when I do a "--list-key --with-colon", I see that in the 2nd field as "q" (undefined). I tried running --update-trustdb.
Is this normal or did I do some steps wrong?
Thank you in advance for any help/advice.

@_date: 2001-09-23 05:36:02

@_subject: Good old Trust 
Is there a single command line to do so? or I would still have to go through
the long way of --edit-key then sign then passphrase? :-)

@_subject: signing key lifetime 
Encryption is trying to keep a series of 0s and 1s "secret" between the originator and the intended receipient(s).
A signing key is to authenticate the correct message. While the encryption key is to obfuscate the 0s and 1s such that no one else can access the correct representation of 0s and 1s (to form coherent message). Encryption key is petty much open to attacks from a third party (attacker) that wants to know the correct representaiton of 0s and 1s. With Moore's law on the attacker's side, attacker is able to brute force search the possible combination better/faster, thus reducing the effectiveness of a encryption key.
How did my $0.02 go, folks? :-)
