@_subject: Incompatibility with CryptoEx OpenPGP CryptoEngine Version 2.1 ? 
do you know about problems concerning public keys generated
by CryptoEx OpenPGP CryptoEngine Version 2.1 ?
I have received several keys from our customer, but out of 6
only one is o.k. for GnuPG.
For PGP there is no problem to read in these 6 keys.
Does there exist any patch ?
Best Regards,
Rainer Bonitz
