well you can rest easy because gpg is basically a free command line
version of pgp, and the two are fully compatible.
good choice. i use enigmail for my email encryption and signing with gpg.
i don't see why importing with enigmail would be a problem, but there
are better ways of importing keys than with enigmail.  first, you
could visit a keyserver like  or
 and look up a person or company in there.
you could also find a gpg-compatible keyserver and type the following
into a dos-box:
gpg --keyserver  --recv-keys the public keyring used by enigmail is the same one that gpg uses. so
find your WinXP user's "Application Data" folder, go to "gnupg" and
the public keyring will be "pubring.gpg" (unless you have it
configured to be elsewhere, and you would know if you did.)
so i hope i helped, and good luck with gpg!

Hash: SHA1
I can't for the life of me figure out how to install GPG for Red Hat
Linux 9.  I have version 1.2.1, which came with my distro, but I would
like to upgrade now.  I tried to find and rpm, but they're all for
like Fedora Core, SuSE, etc.  Also, when I downloaded the source code,
I received a ton of .c and .h files, none of which I know how to
compile.  Can somebody please help me?

Hash: SHA1
The fastest and most reliable keyserver I have come across is this:
website usage - gpg --keyserver usage - hkp://pgpkeys.pca.dfn.de/
These keyservers synchronize very often (i.e. instantaneously) with
other keyservers. The website also looks very cool =P. So these would
be my choice.
If you want the official keyserver, use  The
PGP official server apparently doesn't support gpg keys, or any free key.
hope i helped,

what is the device name of his windows partition?  i have found a way to
mount windows partitions in linux at startup.
as root, gedit /etc/fstab.  add a line like this just before the swap line:
auto,user,exec,rw,async         0 0
create a folder named /win, and reboot. on the gnome desktop there
should be a drive with the title 'win'.  next, configure whatever you
need to run off /win.  This is how i manage windows files in linux.

even though i revoked, removed, and otherwise annihilated my other uids,
then uploaded the key to the Keyserver, the revoked ones still appear.
why don't they just go away?!

after reading this message, i compiled gpg 1.4.2rc1 and it cleaned out
my extra sigs just like you said, but it didn't get rid of them on the
keyserver.  promptly after cleaning my sigs, i uploaded my key to the
server, then downloaded it from the same server.  the unwanted sigs
still came in.  gpg or pgp or somebody should figure out a way for
people to delete keys or certain parts of them from all the keyservers!

i wonder if it's possible to format all your partitions with 2
filesystems.  it would be cool to have an fs that's fat32 and ext3 at
the same time, and it would solve hernan's difficulty.

Found a problem!! Weird one though...
when setting key trust with enigmail for Thunderbird, the openpgp
management gives me an 'undefined error', but after this, it changes the
trust as if nothing went wrong.  I even was the light flashing on my USB
drive, indicating file modification.  Weird... So even though it worked,
it said it didn't.
Though it almost seemed to work, it REALLY IN EFFECT didn't.  it still
doesn't recognize trust changes anywhere but in the OpenPGP key
management.  when verifying sigs, it reports untrusted good sigs.  not
very nice.

i had just the opposite problem. i can't find any kind of a linux
driver for my USB drive. but i quickly figured out how to set this up
in windows without regedit. here's what you do.
1. open gpg.conf (located in your "application data" folder)
2. add the following lines (without quotes) after your
keyserver-options line:
"keyring x:\keys\pubring.gpg
secret-keyring x:\keys\secring.gpg
x:\ is your USB drive and \keys\ is your keyring folder.
3. from your "application data" folder, copy "pubring.gpg" and
"secring.gpg" to x:\keys\.
that is all you have to do. and it won't mess up your registry if you
make a typo.

make sure enigmail is set up correctly. in mozilla mail, go to
Enigmail->Preferences. make sure this is set correctly:
"Basic" tab:
    GnuPG executable path: x:\\gpg.exe where x:\ is your gpg install path.
there are better ways to import keys into enigmail:
1. type "gpg --keyserver  --recv-keys " at a command prompt.
