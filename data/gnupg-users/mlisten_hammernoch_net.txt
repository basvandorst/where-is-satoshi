That's true. Even considering a brute force attack, 1025 bits is in
average only sqrt(2) better as 1024 bits.

This is something around 10^156. This doesn't match my result below.
Exactly. This gives for me 1,84467440737e+146 - please correct me when
I'm wrong.
If an attacker wants to find the specific primes whose product make up
the secret key of the victim, then the the primes are usually around

Hi Holger,
Well, there are different possibilities. First, there (still) are
ckt-Versions of PGP 5/6.x in use which allow creation of such big keys.
Second, everybody is free to modify the key size limits in the existing
gnupg code and compile a version for him/herself. That should not be too
I'm quite conservative and think, that 4096 bits are really really
enough for now and even a lot of years to come. There are far more
weaknesses in the communication chain than a key size below 16384.
No reason to apologize :-)

Ack. And for protection of the private key.
Please don't mix symmetrical encryption strength (I suppose you are
referring to the session key length/encryption algo) with asymmetrical
encryption strength.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest element.

Hi Julia,
Yes, that is true. But the amount of spam coming through spammers that
are harvesting keyservers is much less compared to posting in newsgroups.
Yes, it is possible, but that breaks any encryption front end (like
enigmail) which automatically searches the right key by searching for
the email address in the key description. At least (with enigmail) nasty
work is necessary to manually search the right key for the recipient
when the mail adresses on the key doesn't match the real recipient
address. Encryption with some other front end may not work at all.
Yes, it matters. You won't be able to phone to somebody if he hasn't got
a phone. (Roughly) the same is true for encrypted email.

This may be a drawback of the PGP program. The versions after 2.63 (at
least 5.x and 6.x) did not state the charset used, so all the non-Ascii
characters are transposed when you decrypt on a platform using a
different charset than the encrypting machine.
The only thing you can do about this to decrypt the old emails, filter
them through a script to recode the non-ASCIIs and reencrypt the with gpg.

Generally: Decryption works fine even with a revoked key. However, if
there's only the slightest possibility that the private key is not
solely under the owners control, then encrypted files should be
decrypted and then reencrypted with the new key.
One should never ever delete a revoked key - there still might be a
forgotten old backup encrypted to the old key!

In this case, the following is happening: he/she is citing your mail

insertion of citation marks, e.g. "> " at the beginning of the lines,
your original message is modified, so the signature is broken.
It doesn't make much sense to sign messages to recipients who can't

You seem to have misunderstood what ownertrust is good for. Trusting
an owner about placing his signatures is not about how she/he signs
It is about how carefully she/he checks identity and mail address
before signing other keys. You can only judge that if you have seen
her/him in real life doing that.

You cannot get trust from good or bad mail signatures. You also cannot
get distrust.
A "bad signature" _only shows one thing_: The message was modified
along the way from the signing process (at the senders computer) to
the verification process (at your computer). This can be a tool
shortcoming, a mail server mangling the contents or the mailinglist
software. You cannot decide where the modification took place. So all
evidence is technical. There's absolutely no reson to distrust the
mail sender. 1000 good mail signatures from him don't show anything
regarding his key. 1000 bad signatures either.
The only place to get trust to the senders key (i.e. to make it
"valid" for you) is to meet the key owner in real life, verify the
identity documents, his fingerprint and mail addresses and sign his
key if everything is ok. There's no measure to replace this procedure.

You can sign the new cert with your old one, but I'm not sure if that
trust chain holds if you revoke your old cert. Also, more and more
people will not be able to hold your old cert in their keyring when

Hi Ingo,
Whilelists: The OpenPGP-aware clients. There aren't so many of them,
so that's manageable.
There is a community providing keyservers (such as
pool.sks-keyservers.net). My impression is that this network is well
maintained and has worked reliably the last years.
Why should there not be a similar community approach for setting up a
(smaller) network of validating key server proxies.
DANE requires write access to DNS. I don't see that the average
OpenPGP user has facilities and knowledge to achieve setting up the
required DNS records. If you can't convince the big mail providers
(e.g. Google, GMX here in Germany, ...) to provide a reasonable
interface for their users, I'm afraid that this will not be a success,

Hash: SHA512
Let's concentrate on this one, I think this is the real tough task:
establishing a trust chain from the validating servers to the client.
There's one root certificate, signing the individual proxy certificates.
Each individual proxy has a certificate it is using for creating the
validating signatures.
Each client only needs to have the root certificate builtin. If it
encounters a validation proxy's certificate, it will download it.
If a proxy certificate is known compromised, the signature from the
root certificate is revoked.
If the root certificate is compromised (and revoked), the scheme will
require new client versions with a new root certificate builtin.
The client itself must refresh the root certificate and all downloaded
proxy certificates regularly.
This all requires a very small group of maintainers for the root
certificate (2 or 3 people), issueing and revoking signatures for
proxy certificates.
The client authors will need to have a trust chain to at least one
root certificate maintainer. This is also true for the proxy maintainers
This is my view of the problem :-)

"Good signature" _always_ means it is "good" in the cryptographical
technical sense: Your copy of the public key states that it comes from
the same source as the key owning entity. It does _not_ state that the
key is "valid" or that it belongs to the person stated by the user id
attached to the key.
GnuPG issues a respective warning; a test by verifying an old signed
mail with an old revoked key yields:
! gpg: Signature made Thu Jun 12 22:35:47 2008 CEST using RSA key ID
! ! gpg: Good signature from ! gpg: WARNING: This key has been revoked by its owner!
! gpg:          This could mean that the signature is forged.
