I tried to compile gnupg-1.0.7 on Comaq Tru64 and got the following =
cat ./../doc/HACKING \
    ./../doc/DETAILS \
    ./../doc/FAQ         >plain-large
../g10/gpg --homedir . --quiet --yes --import ./pubdemo.asc     =20
gpg: out of  memory while allocating 0 bytes
make[2]: *** [prepared.stamp] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/gnupg-1.0.7/checks'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/gnupg-1.0.7'
make: *** [all] Error 2
I tried it on different systems with more or less memory.
I tried it with different OS-versions from 4.0G to 5.1.
I tried to disable nls, dynload and asm.
I tried it with gcc V. 3.0.4 and the original Compaq CC.
The error is always the same.
If anybody can give me a hint please send it to glauserj =
 .
I would be happy.
Kind regards

Hello David
Thank you very much for the patch.
I was now able to compile gnupg 1.0.7 on Compaq Tru64 V4.0G and V5.1. =
It worked fine with gcc and also with the original Compaq C-compiler.
Have a nice day.

This is fixed in 1.0.8.  In the meantime, you can apply the attached
patch to util/memory.c.
