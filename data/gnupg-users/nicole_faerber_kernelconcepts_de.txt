I am pretty sure that we did not :)
But we usually point out that _specification_ is open.

Oh please, I am using gnupg with the same keys on at least five
machines with no issue.
I simply copied the .gnupg directory, end of story.

as one from kernel concepts I need to apologize for the inconvenience,
we had some major reworks in our infrastrcuture these days. Now things
start to get settled again, mail should work and the website should
also be up again - but there might still be glitches, I am sorry.
We still do supply the cards, worldwide. If you have any questions,
please do not hesitate to contact me by personal email.
Kind regards
