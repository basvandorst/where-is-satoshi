I'm quite a beginner to gnupg.
I would like to have a master key used for both encrypting documents and mail and a subkey of that used for SSH.
Following this I first set up the keys:
sec? ed25519/CFCD435B280B6CD2
 ???? created: 2019-02-22? expires: 2021-02-21? usage: SC
 ???? trust: ultimate????? validity: ultimate
ssb? cv25519/4FD4A5C38C7715BB
 ???? created: 2019-02-22? expires: 2021-02-21? usage: E
ssb? ed25519/B84BE844E27BFE21
 ???? created: 2019-02-22? expires: 2021-02-21? usage: A
[ultimate] (1). swedebugia (followed these two guides:  and I get this after restarting my gpg-agent:
$ gpg-agent --server
OK Pleased to meet you
and in another terminal:
$ ssh-add -l
The agent has no identities.
My environment is this:
$ env|grep SSH
$ gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket
My configs are attached.
Thanks in advance!

I think I did it correctly. Here is the output of the grip:
$ gpg2 --with-keygrip -k swedebugia

My problem is that neither gpg-agent nor ssh-add gives me debug output
so I can pinpoint the error.
I resorted to creating a separate ssh-key with ssh-keygen instead as it
seems to be a hassle to keep it in gpg and use it from there.
