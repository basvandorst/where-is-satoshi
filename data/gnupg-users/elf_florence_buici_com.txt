@_subject: How should a front-end handle a stored passphrase 
I am revisiting a program I started about three years ago.  As it may
sign more than one file during an execution run, it asks the user to
enter the passphrase which it later passes to gpg using a file
descriptor.  The descriptor prevents the passphrase from appearing on
a command line or within a file.  Still, the passphrase is stored in
memory during program execution.  Is there some precation I should
take with how it is stored?

@_subject: public key on R/O device? (trustdb unwritable) 
I want to put a public key on a read-only device and use it, along
with gpg, to perform a signature check.    gpg --no-greeting --batch --verify --homedir /floppy - While the signature verification succeeds, this command returns a
failure code when the floppy is read-only because the trustdb cannot
be written.  The return code is 2 which appears to be the same result
as when the public key cannot be found.
Is there an override that will prevent updates to the trust database?
