@_subject: signing party: webserver software for key submission? 
Just wondering if anyone knows of any scripts for collecting keys into
a keyring prior to a key signing party (i.e., for people who intend to
participate to submit their keys)?

@_subject: Read --status-fd with Expect 
Hi Jack,
The argument to --status-fd must be an open file descriptor.  Not
sure of a way to open a raw file descriptor in expect, but you could
use mkfifo(1) and the --status-file argument instead, I think.

@_subject: gcaff - graphical key signing assistant 
Hi users
I'd like to introduce you to the graphical key signing tool I have
written: gcaff (so named due to caff, the command line program that
inspired it).
Features include:
* display and sign photographic uids
* use multiple signing keys at once
* choose the certification level on a per-key basis
* email each signature separately, only to the associated email
  address (like caff)
To install: `pip install gcaff`
More information and source code: The program is very much in its infancy and has not been heavily
tested (I was intending to put it through its paces signing keys
from the linux.conf.au 2013 keysigning party, but I misplaced the
fingerprint list in the intervening weeks!)  Any testing would be
appreciated, along with general feedback, bug reports and patches.

@_subject: gcaff-0.2 now available; graphical signing assistant 
Hi gnupg-users,
gcaff-0.2 is available immediately on PyPI[1] and GitHub[2].
[1] [2] Release highlights:
* fixed a crash bug on platforms where pipes are unidirectional
  (e.g. Linux)
* fixed a bug that caused the first uid to be dropped when using
  GnuPG v1
* removed the arbitrary limit on the number of keys (whups!)
* supply --use-agent in case GnuPG (v1) is not configured to use the
  agent
* test for gpg-agent and local mailer connectivity on startup
gcaff is a graphical tool for signing OpenPGP keys, inspired by
caff.  Features include:
* display and sign photo UIDs
* sign with multiple signing keys in one pass
* choose the certification level on a per-key basis
* email each signature separately, only to the associated email
  address

@_subject: Installation 
A compiler cannot be found.  Do you have a C compiler installed?  If
so, which compiler (and operating system?)  If not, you could
install `gcc' and try again.

Not so; this analogy might seem useful for explaining message
encryption, but will lead to more confusion when attempting to
understand/explain signing - where indeed the public key is used to
decrypt a digest encrypted by a public key.

@_subject: This time in English: How to explain the principles of PGP, 
The way I attempt to explain public key encryption and signing:
    Each key in the keypair - one kept private to the owner, the
    other made public - is both:
    a) A set of instructions for building a lock that *only* the
       other key can unlock; and
    b) The key for such a lock as could be built with the other key.
    Therefore, a encrypted message can be sent to someone by using
    their public key to build a "lock" for the message.  Only the
    private key is able to "unlock" it.
    Similarly, a sender of some message can authenticate it by using
    their private key to "lock" the message.  If it can be
    "unlocked" by their public key, only a person who possesses the
    private key could have built that lock.
I hope this explanation makes sense.  Let me know if you could
suggest improvements to this analogy.

Whups.  The digest is encrypted by the *private* key, of course :)

Hi all,
An OpenPGP Best Practices article from riseup.net has been doing the
rounds today.  Quite a lot of good info, especially regarding key
strength and expiry, and digest preferences.

@_subject: "gpg --with-fingerprint $FILE" is not listing the keyfingerprint 
This behaviour also occurs for me in 2.0.22.  Instead of exporting
the key, you could use --list-keys, which works for me:
    % gpg2 --with-colons --with-fingerprint --list-keys 0xBB065B251FF4945B

Hi Sam,
Have you seen [1]?  It explains how to extend FreeIPA with custom
schema and (if it is neeeded) add plugins for working with the new
schema from the command line.
[1] If you get stuck, head over to freeipa-users at redhat.com.  And even
if you don't get stuck, let them** know how you go because this is
an interesting integration story.
** "them" includes me.  I work at Red Hat in the identity management

@_subject: GnuPG public key vulnerability? 
Some versions of the YubiKey 4 were affected by the ROCA
vulnerability, which caused weak keys to be generated.
I would say that is what the email is about.
