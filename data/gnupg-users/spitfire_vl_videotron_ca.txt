@_subject: GnuPG crashes on Windows 2000 
Hello, I'm using Microsoft Windows 2000 professional english version and I'm
trying to get GnuPG to work. For some reason, after carefully reading the
README.W32, the programs crashes when I try to --gen-key. It segfaults when
it generates the key. I use version 1.0.6
Any ideas what's causing this?
