Okay, before Werner wakes up to find this issue coming back up, I'll attack it.  The problems with Darwin (we should talk in terms of Darwin, not OS X, because OS X is Darwin++, but GnuPG only cares about the Darwin parts, which are the same in OS X as in straight Darwin) have nothing to do with GnuPG in particular.  It is only that GnuPG is one of the programs whose configure scripts won't work with zsh.  Many work just find on Darwin, but there are a few that need tweaking.  Now, if there are legitimate problems with GnuPG on Darwin (like function x returning a value of type double rather than float or something like that which might cause problems) that would be something to warrant a change in GnuPG, just as it would with any other Unix.  Werner was very clear about this before:  GnuPG is only responsible for problems with itself, not problems with the build

You have to --disable-asm unless you have the Darwin asm patch (which probably ought to be part of the next GnuPG release, but that's a devel issue).

Not exactly related, but some of you may find it interesting what ent has to say about random_seed:
localhost% ent random_seed
Entropy = 7.704649 bits per byte.
Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 600 byte file by 3 percent.
Chi square distribution for 600 samples is 214.93, and randomly
would exceed this value 95.00 percent of the times.
Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 134.2000 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.080000000 (error 1.96 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000742 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
localhost% ent -b random_seed
Entropy = 0.999503 bits per bit.
Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 4800 bit file by 0 percent.
Chi square distribution for 4800 samples is 3.31, and randomly
would exceed this value 10.00 percent of the times.
Arithmetic mean value of data bits is 0.5131 (0.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.080000000 (error 1.96 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.005693 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
I'm not sure just how it's used, so I included it both ways.  I think this makes it pretty clear that no-random-seed-file is probably a good thing to have in .gnupg/options unless your machine can't collect entropy for anything.
Also, last time I checked the entropy on Darwin it looked fine, but I did it myself using my own statistics software.  Now that I've got ent installed I want to try with it, but I can't remember for anything how I got access to the entropy pool of egd.  Any ideas (this would also help anyone on Unix test, so speak up if you know)?
I tried this:
localhost% egd.pl --debug-pool /tmp/entropy
which is supposed to print the pool, but the data it gives back is horrible and it's obvious that it's not no entropy gathering has gone on because there isn't the usually delay of waiting for entropy to be collected, sort of like when I run GnuPG to generate keys and it sucks egd dry and has to gather more.

Case sensitivity is not a problem, since I'm using UFS, which is a work alike fs of that used by the BSDs.  I did this on purpose, since I knew that sometimes there is only a difference in case in file names in Unix software.  HFS+, the old but still good fs of the Mac is just case preserving, but 'file' and 'File' can't reside in the same directory.
Actually, most software compiles well, but both gnupg and bash had problems like this (fortunately, someone else figured out bash and put up OS X binaries for the rest of us).
As a test, I tried running make with Makefile.in rather than the blank Makefile.  This mostly worked, but on line 182 it comes back with:
localhost% make -f Makefile.in
Makefile.in:182: *** missing separator.  Stop.
I should also note that it is just mainly GNU software that won't compile, so if there is something related to all GNU software's make process, maybe this is the problem.  There must be some way around it, though, since Apple included plenty of GNU tools for use with the command line.
Oh, one more thing.  When running the previously mentioned logging of what ./configure does, I noticed this line related to sed:

and this next line popped up a lot, though with different numbers at the end:

Not being a make or sed master, I'm not entirely sure if they are relevant, but they looked like something that might matter.

Hash: SHA1
Depends on a couple of things.  For one thing, it depends on how easily your Web site can be defaced.  For example, I'm fairly confident that having the key for the Mac GPG project posted to the same Web site is a safe means of redistributing the key because from what I can tell Sourceforge has pretty secure servers.  Just to be safe, though, I reupload the page with the key on it on a regular basis.  On my personal Web site, hosted at mac.com, I'm less confident, since I do not believe Apple has their site locked down the way Sourceforge does.  Both places a reasonable for posting my public key, though.
Public key servers are pretty safe, AFAIK.  I always use MIT's because it's been around for a good while and is pretty trustworthy. I can't think of any successful attacks on key servers off the top of my head, but I'm sure there have been at least a few but hopefully the key servers have taken care of it.  Of course, even if the key server is okay, the key being sent could be changed out from under you on the way (especially if you connect through a proxy server, which I recommend you not do when accessing a key server).
So, the final word is that both are good means of distributing your public key, but what really matters is the web of trust and making sure that the key is good before you use it.  I know many people do not do this properly, which often has me worried about how good the web of trust really is.  When it comes down to it, if you're in a position where having the good key is vitally important (as in if you encrypt to the wrong key it's not a matter of someone else knowing what you ate for dinner last night, but where you could loose money, life, suffer pain, etc.), pay a few cents to make a phone call and verify the key with the real person (of course, if you've read the latest CRYPTO-GRAM, you know the phone network will soon become unsuitable for this task).
Oh, and I always put my key ID in my sig since it let's other know that I use PGP makes it easy to get my key.  Once they've got a key, a number of things will let them know if they got the right one.

Yes, here's what to do.  Open up PGP.  Select the key that you want. Then, choose export from the Key menu, I think.  While exporting there should be two checkboxes:  one for include secret key and another about compatibility with 6.x versions.  You need to check both.  Then, just copy that file over an import it into GnuPG.  Also, if it doesn't work the first time, you may need to fix the line endings on your file to be line feeds instead of line feeds and carriage returns.

Anyway, the Mac GPG project has released a beta of GPGME 0.2.2.  It is a framework (so you probably should officially call it GPGME.framework to avoid confusion with GPGME; that's what I do) that allows any OS X developer access to GPGME via an Objective C wrapper. We need people to check code and test it for holes.  As always, the more eyes the better.

Put, putting my misuse of terminology aside, I guess what you're saying is that EGD is better suited for use with GnuPG than PRNGD is, even if EGD could use an improvement or two from what the PRNGD documentation is claiming about EGD basically failing to look at sources of entropy anymore (but I'm guessing in those cases it completely blocks, or so I hope).

Well, I've been thinking about this, and I think I have a clear way of doing it.  On small lists where a message actually being from me might matter (like the Mac GPG developer list), I'm going to sign.  I know I have signed messages in the past that I send nearly everywhere, but I finally realized that this doesn't really help in most cases, just adds extra bytes to the message, because no one on the list can likely even check the validity of my signature, just get a message that it's good.
But, from this message, I guess we can all see your opinion.  ;-)

Well, before we get a full debate going, I still see it as not doing anyone any good.  If you want to encourage the use of PGP (which you should), then do something like I do and put your key ID in your sig. People will see the funny numbers and letters and, after a while, get curious and check that PGP thing out.  Same effect as signing everything, just without all the extra, useless bytes.

It works in Eudora, but it's annoying.  I have to get your key and let PGP go through trying to verify the message in Eudora in order to read it; I can't read *PGP/MIME stuff without it having gone through this.  As you might imagine, I'm not too excited about putting the key of every little person that posts to the list in this way, so unless you post a lot, and I mean a lot, I don't have your key and just skip your messages.

@_subject: Mutt/GnuPG doc initial release 
It will display the message with an error message like key could not be verified or something like that if it can't find the key in your keyring or on a keyserver.  The main problem is that if the key can't be found, I have to wait a couple minutes to see the message while it tries to find the key.  I just don't have the time for all the extra time that each PGP/MIME message entails.  I have no idea if it's the same in other mail clients, but here on OS X things should be much better in a couple months once we have clients using GPGME.framework.

And, yes, that will be an option for me, in a few months.  Right now, though, on OS X there is no mail client that supports GnuPG for production level use, so I have to use Eudora under OS 9 with NSI's PGP plug in.  Before everyone forgets, I was just letting folks know that there was another MUA that doesn't support PGP/MIME as gracefully as it could.

Correct, and all my friends know this (on a rare occasion if I fail to sign a message for some reason they've picked up the phone and called me to make sure that the message was from me and to send it again, signed, just to be sure).  On a list, though, much as you'd like to think otherwise, only a handful of people are well known and a message that is out of line for them will look forged.  Otherwise, no one cares if a message is from you are not, we're just interested in your ideas, not you.  Even when sending in code for people to use, I would certainly hope they actually read the code before doing anything with it (like the recently posted procmail stuff), so signing probably doesn't do much good even there.

The program runs fine all the way through to returning from main(), and when it does that there's a This may not be what's happening in this case, but that's something that I've experienced so you may want to check for it.

Just for everyone's info, the Mac GPG Project has released Mac GPG Keys, a GUI front end for GnuPG via GPGME and a little AppleScript scripting with Terminal.app.
You can check it out at:  Also, if anyone from the GNUStep community is working on or interested in working on something similar that will run on GNUStep please contact Gordon Worley                     `When I use a word,' Humpty Dumpty

Hope I'm not being too dim, but does this have any effect on Diffie-Hellman keys?  I thought that the two were based on similar math.

I fail to see what `official' binary releases add.  I'd much rather see the GnuPG team spend time working on GnuPG than releasing binaries for any and all systems.  If someone else is willing to take over releasing Windows binaries from Werner et al., I think that it's a good move.  Besides, I have no idea how much the GnuPG team knows about Windows, but you're probably better off having someone who knows Windows really well releasing a binary/installer than someone in the GnuPG team.

@_subject: Adding photos 
With the new photo options in 1.0.7, people on the Mac GPG list have been having fun with checking out my photo and the photos on other keys.  This inspired me to try to update my photo.  Things have not gone My current photo is a meager 2471 bytes.  Unfortunately, I can't seem to add such a small photo any longer since GPG is requiring a JPEG.  When I added my photo it was in PICT format (a relative of TIFF IIRC) and I'm guessing PGP did some compression to get the 2 kB photo.  With GPG, still trying to add a 120x144 photo, I can't get one any smaller than about 13 kB because it has to be JPEG.  Is there any particular reason that this file has to be JPEG or is that really just a suggestion?  GPG seems to handle my current photo just fine and is able to display it.
Thanks for any information on this.

@_subject: configure produces zero length Makefile 
Ah, but, if you'll search through configure you'll find that there are places that still have CDPATH= directly rather than with this testing mechanism.  Plus, IIRC, I found that only the first such line actually worked, but then I don't think I spent a lot of time testing it.

If not, someone needs to get to work.  We've already got that feature over on Mac OS X with gpgme and GPGFileTool.

Ahem, in that case, let's hope that no one actually uses that key.  Of course, since the person is obviously a Mac GPG users, he would never, ever do anything like that.  ;-)
