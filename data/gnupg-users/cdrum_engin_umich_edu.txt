@_subject: compiling on solaris2.6, sparc, using cc 
I am trying to compile version 1.06 on a Solaris 2.6 machine (sparc) using the sun compiler cc.
setenv CC "cc"
so, I wun configure, it finds the cc compiler, it seems ok.  Then I try
make  all-recursive
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/share/src/gnupg-1.0.6'
Making all in intl
make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/share/src/gnupg-1.0.6/intl'
cc -c -DLOCALEDIR=\"/usr/local/share/locale\"
-DLIBDIR=\"/usr/local/lib\" -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I.. -I. -I../intl  intl-compat.c
"/usr/include/stddef.h", line 21: invalid type combination
"/usr/include/stddef.h", line 21: warning: useless declaration
"/usr/include/stddef.h", line 21: warning: typedef declares no type name
make[2]: *** [intl-compat.o] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/share/src/gnupg-1.0.6/intl'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/share/src/gnupg-1.0.6'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2
I tried setting CFLAGS to various things, including -DSYSV, but no luck.
oh.. when I ran configure, some of the messages that caught my eye:
checking size of unsigned short... (cached) 0
checking size of unsigned int... (cached) 0
checking size of unsigned long... (cached) 0
checking size of unsigned long long... (cached) 0
configure: warning: Hmmm, something is wrong with the sizes - using
have any ideas?
Thank you!

Ok, I didn't even think to
setenv CC "ucbcc"
it works!  it reports the correct sizes for the datatypes when I run
I apologize for this post - before I did "in-depth research".
thanks for your help

@_subject: Newbie questions. 
you can always sign up for yahoo's pop service (no additional fee, just an
annoying email - spam-like - from yahoo every week or month - i can't
remember..)  Then you could use outlook or something to decrypt/encrypt.
check out your yahoo mail account options for how to set up pop..
 Hi all.
}> I have several questions about gnupg...
}> 1). If someone sends an encrypted email to my yahoo mail acct., how do
}> I extract it? Do I have to copy and paste ( win32 ) it into a file with
}> ( for example ) notepad?
}> 2). If someone sends me their public key, how do I extract it yahoo
}> mail? Since I am using a service ( no commmand line ) I am not sure.
}> 3). I have often seen digital signatures appended to email messages or

}> file?
}> I am using a win32 machine for all encryption / decryption.
}> Thanks, Caitlin.
