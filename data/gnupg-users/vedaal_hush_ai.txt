Hash: RIPEMD160
On Wed, 04 Dec 2002 02:58:04 -0800 Johan Wevers 'complete' source is released,
even to the point of them relying on one's honor,
to not bypass the 'licensing' requirements and activate the 'non-free'
{if it is 'too busy'at pgp.com, you can get it from zedz:
a reasonable courtesy to contain any damage that the bug might cause
if published in the wild, before a chance is given to correct it
whatever anyone else can say about it,
{and there is what to say}
it is still the *easiest* gui encryption software to use,
and is now once again open source,
and can be an easy starting point for people who otherwise would not use
'any' encryption, and do not yet want to hear about manual option entries
or command lines
{until their tastes yearn for the many more things that can be done with gnupg, and then they eventually use gnupg}
also btw,
it now accepts the new secret key format, with Respect,

and in general, i prefer ckt,
about which Imad gave his word that there would be no ckt versions of pgp8
when full source code would be released, {btw, a really good thing a gnupg, is that all the developers are open to
incorporating reasonable requests/suggestions from users.
NAI was not so, even when the actual code changes, ready for compilation,
were offered,
the new pgp management, however is much more receptive, and has already
incorporated changes to work with newer gnupg secret keys and subkeys}
{i speak Dutch, and can sort-of follow written German }
a common compatibility problem that perhaps should be addressed :((
you searched on a gpg keyserver, not a pgp server
try ldap://pgp.surfnet.nl:11370
the key has been there for a while
who can be spoken to that could arrange for gpg and pgp servers to
communicate with each other and share keys?

@_subject: simultaneous symmetric and public key encryption ? 
is it possible to symmetrically encrypt to one person, and at the same time encrypt the session key to another person's public key?
i had a situation where 3 of us were working on a pdf, and one person needed to revoke his key, and asked for a symmetrically encrypted file
{i simply sent the encrypted pdf file separately to each one, but needed two encryptions, two e-mails, etc.}
would having the possibility of simultaneously encrypting symmetrically and to a public key, allow for a vulnerability in being able to crack
the passphrase for the symmetric encryption?

@_subject: simultaneous symmetric and public key encryption ? 
but wouldn't it then be 'easier' for the person to whose key it is simultaneously encrypted, to crack the passphrase used for the symmetric encryption?
assume a message is encrypted to Alice's public key, and simultanoeusly
also symmetrically encrypted to Bob.
Alice has the plaintext, the ciphertext, and the session key for the message.
would that make it easier to solve for [session key hashed with passphrase]
than if the session key were not known?
{and therefore a vulnerability in communications between the sender
and Bob, if they continue with the same or similar passphrases for symmetric encryption}
or is it still insignificant enough with a 128 bit symmetric encryption,
to not make any difference?
