@_subject: Integrating GPG with MIME and exmh? 
I just replaced Debian's GPG 0.4.3 with the new 1.0.0 version. Now I'm using GPG with exmh, and the integration was really nice until I removed the GPG Debian package. After that, writing signed and encrypted messages still works as good as it did, but the support for reading application/pgp is gone.
Looks like I have to add some appropriate lines to /etc/mailcap, but I don't know what to put there to make things work as good as they did. With the Debian package, signed messages would be displayed in clear text, with a button above them to check the signature... How do I do that?

@_subject: Deleting secret keys w/o public keys 
I have some secret keys in my secret keyring I don't have the
public keys for (these keys are old RSA keys, somehow remainders
from first tries with PGP). Now GPG gives me error messages like
gpg: key XXXXXXXX: secret key without public key - skipped
each time I encrypt or decrypt something.
Deleting the keys with --delete-secret-key or
 --delete-secret-and-public-key doesn't work, that leads to:
gpg: 0xXXXXXXXX: user not found
gpg: 0xXXXXXXXX: delete key failed: public key not found
How do I delete these keys?
Thanx for your help -- and please Cc: me, since I'm not subscribed
to this mailing list...
