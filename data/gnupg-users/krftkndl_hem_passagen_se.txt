@_subject: Changing primary user ID? 
I wonder if it is possible to change the primary user ID of a key in
GnuPG? I'm about to change primary email address and would like to change
my key to reflect that. I haven't found the answer in the documentation,
if it is there I apologize and would appreciate a pointer.
I tried deleting the old user ID and re-adding it. This makes the user
IDs appear in the new order in GnuPG and on the pgp.net keyservers, but
when I search on keyserver.net, it claims that the old user ID is still
Search URIs:
Adding "&template=netensearch%2Cnetennomatch%2Cnetenerror" to the end of
the keyserver.net URI makes it even more obvious, with little blue and
grey illustrations... :)
Please CC your answers to me, I'm afraid I don't have the time to read
the list.
Thanks in advance,
  Kalle Svensson
