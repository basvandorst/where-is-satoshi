@_subject: My french name doesn't turn right 
Hi everybody,
I am terribly upset because of my french name (Fran=E7ois).
I have read that it is fine to have cedilla or umlaut in
one's name in gnupg but here it is what I get in gnupg=20
[jan jan]$ gpg --edit-key fjan

(1)  Fran=E7ois Jan (2)  Fran=E7ois Jan (3)  Fran=E7ois Jan (4). Fran=E7ois Jan Well, the command-messages from gnupg are messed up but I read
something about gnupg not using gettext. It wouldn't bother me
if it was the only problem....because I found out that despite
my name looks good in gnupg, it doesn't in the wide world. GPA
shows me the Fran=C2=A7ois thing and so does keyserver.net
By reading through the mailing-list, I know there is no hope=20
correcting the problem and I would like to simply add a new Id
but how should I do since my gnupg doesn't understand me right.
If you've got any idea, I would greatly appreciate.
