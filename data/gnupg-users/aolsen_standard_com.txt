@_subject: Validating encrypted files 
Hash: SHA512
I have encountered something that does not seem to be covered by any of the FAQs, manuals, or other general hints.  I figured I might find a couple of good hints here.
I have a number of files that I have received.  I can decrypt them or not.  I can check the signature or not.
What I want to do is verify that the file was encrypted and to what keys.  I can kludge something together by using --status-fd and grep.  I am hoping for something a little more user friendly and/or script friendly.  It is not always obvious that a file is encrypted.  I have encountered files that have been signed ascii armored data that look encrypted, but are only encoded.  The problem is that it *does* decrypt, but with no hint that it was not encrypted in the first place.
I also occasionally need to verify the integrity of the encryption.  (Sometimes we get damaged files.  If it is damaged, there is no clear way of telling beforehand.)  I believe --verify-files will do this, but it is pretty unclear from reading the docs/man pages. If the file is damaged, the only indication(s) are error messages that mean little or nothing.  (I am trying to get the files sent as ascii armored, but that step is many people out of my reach.) Does --verify-files only verify signatures or will it also check for valid data in the data?
Ideas?  Should there be an "--file-info" command that would tell you the state of a file? (Encrypted with what keys, signed by what keys, etc.)

Hash: SHA512
The place I work needs to upgrade gpg badly.  They know this.  The question is do they go with the 1.4.x tree or should they go to the 2.x codebase?
Suggestions? Recommendations? We get files from clients all over the world.  Are there features used in the 2.x versions that 1.4.x cannot handle?

Hash: SHA512
[Sorry for the top posting. Crappy Outlook makes anything else difficult/impossible.]
If you are using OS X, don't use Fink.  Just build the packages yourself from source.  (The compilers are on the devel disc that comes with OS X.)  It works fine and does not suffer from the bjorked dependancies that Fink create.  I have built many many packages from gnu source with little or no problems without using Fink. It is a good idea, I am just not happy with how it turned out.

@_subject: [Announce] GnuPG's 10th birthday 
Hash: SHA512
There were other issues back in those days.
MIT was forced to use the RSAREF library which had a non free license.  At first they used the RSAREF2 library, but then they were told to use the RSAREF1 library.  (I diffed the two libraries and determined that the only difference was that RSAREF2 had fixed a number of buffer overflows and other security flaws.  There were no added features.)  If I remember correctly, 2.5 had RSAREF2 and 2.6 had RSAREF1.  One of the main reasons for the creation of the "International version" was the use of RSAREF.  (Besides the security issues, it was pretty damn slow.  In the days of the i386 people cared about speed.)
Now get off my lawn you young wippersnappers!

@_subject: Safe decryption with GnuPG? 
Hash: SHA512
I am using full disk encryption on Fedora 9 alpha and it has not caused much slowdown at all.  Since it encrypted the entire logical volume swap is included.
If hitting swap is an issue, you have other problems.  (You need to buy more RAM.)  It speed is really an issue here, then you need to look at a hardware upgrade.
Of course, this depends on what operating system you are using.  If you are using Windows, then I cannot help you.  (Except maybe in getting off that insecure monstrocity.)

@_subject: Corporate use of gnupg 
Hash: SHA512
Someone else brought up the issue of the technique being patented.  (Seems like a pretty obvious idea, but so are most software patents.)
In a corporate setting, you really just want key escrow.  Have a "official" company signing key.  When new employees come on board, they are issued a PGP/GPG key that is signed and the secret key data is copied to non-volitile media and stored in a safe.  It is only available under restricted circumstances (to prevent managers from exploiting the keys for their own gain).  It also gives some authenticity to the key by having some sort of web of trust internally.  Something like this takes manpower and time to manage, but so does manageing employee keycards and other authorization data.
Not that I have ever seen a company that does this.  Even companies that make heavy use of encryption do not seem to have anyone at a mamagement level that understands how it needs to be managed.

@_subject: Question about history of hash and cipher collections 
Hash: SHA512
Version will not report it that way, but decryption errors will.  If you have an older version of GPG that does not know about the newer cypher or hash, it will report "cypher n" or "hash n".  I have encountered this on systems that have not been upgraded for a while.  (And, yes, there is an upgrade in process.)  The information is useful in that case when you are trying to explain to production people what happened when their file decryption failed.

Not quite what I meant.  (I should really not post on a Monday until I am fully awake.  Which means posting on Tuesday.)
Actually what I meant to say is that the cypher numbers is actually useful if you are trying to figure out what you are missing from older versions.

Hash: SHA512
Not really.  If it is signed by enough people in your web of trust or by a "trusted introducer" you will not get that message.  It really depends on how many signatures there are on the particular key and who the signatures are from.

Not that it would help.  Their web site has been pretty much FUBARed for the last few weeks.
The reduced rounds issue is enough of an excuse to get me to recommend that our customers upgrade.

@_subject: urgent gpg help needed with regards to file size. 
Hash: SHA512
How are you transporting the files?  If you are using FTP you need to make sure you use BINARY mode for the transfer or it will do nasty things to the file.  (You can also encode the data with ascii armor and it will prevent FTP from mangling the data.)
Gpg compresses the files as part of the encryption process.
Another thing is if the file is bigger than about 2 gigs or so, older Oses that do not handle large files may truncate the data.

@_subject: Need recommendation on keyserver code 
Hash: SHA512
I need to build a private keyserver for interanl use.
I have tried to get SKS to build, but I have never been able to get it to work.  (The project seems to be almost abandoned.)  I am using Fedora 9 on an x86_64 box with 4 gigs of ram and Numerix blows up on compile with "out of memory" errors.
I have not seen anything else that handles subkeys.
Any recommendations?

@_subject: how long should a password be? 
Hash: SHA512
Passwords should be as many characters as you can remember plus one.
Actually for long passphrases I use bizarre memorable sentences. You can add in extra punctuation if you are able to remember that.  My usual passphrases are 50-60 characters, but since they are phrased in a way I can remember them, I don't forget them.
Examples would be:
"Never buy Fix-O-Dent from a veterinarian."
"Never buy corn oil from a podiatrist."
"Never buy baby oil from a pediatrician."
"Never buy tartar sauce from a dentist."
Or you can construct something longer, if you want.  (Those are kind of short, but what comes to mind at the moment.)

Couple reasons:
1) I need to run this on Solaris.
2) The licenses for PGP are handled by another department.
3) My budget is $0.00.
4) I plan on running this at home as well on my home internal network which runs Linux
5) Eventually I want to package at least one keyserver for Fedora.
There are more reasons, but they get complex and involve a lot of internal politics.

Those patches do not fix my build problems.  (It is running out of memory compiling numerix.ml.)  Your patches are also for a much earlier version of numerix.
I have sent mail to the SKS author to see if he has any ideas.
Compiled with no problems.  (The bzr version took a bit more.  Had to page in the memories of how autoconf developer builds work.)
I have not tested Onak yet.  I have a keyserver dump I am going to load into it and see what happens.

I believe the problem has to do with the version of OCAML I am using.  3.10.1 seems to have problems.  3.10.2 has been released. I am going to try that.  I am also using x86_64 and that may have something to do with it.
The patch takes a bit to apply.  The code still needs patching at that point in the code. The code location has changed quite a bit though.
Probably need it.  It has been a chore to get anything working with SKS.  Probably since I am using a version of Fedora 9 out of Rawhide...

A new version of sks was released over the weekend.  So far, it looks like it will work.  (It at least builds.)  The author removed the dependancies on Numerix and fixed it to work with DB 4.6.x.
