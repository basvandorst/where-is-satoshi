@_subject: Key Import 
Hello Graham
to import your trust-database, it must be exported first to have it in the right form. like this:
gpg --export-ownertrust > trust.txt 	(on your windows machine)
then you can import that file on your linuxbox with
gpg --import-ownertrust trust.txt
To be able to import a secret key you have to give the
--allow-secret-key-import  option. Like this:
gpg --import --allow-secret-key-import secring.gpg
But all this can be found in the manpage ( man gpg)
 Greetings Christoph

@_subject: FAQ update for MUAs supporting GnuPG 
* Am Mon, Sep 16, 2002 at 09:36:10PM -0700 , schrieb David Scribner:
Since all these MUAs handle the encryption another way, i think it would be
interesting to add another category which says which MUA can commuicate with
wich. Because of that old PGP/mime and app/pgp stuff it is often hard to
tell wether one can send encrypted mail or not.
Greetings Chris
