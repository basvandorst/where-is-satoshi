@_subject: Shouldn't keyservers store and provide subkeys? 
[I'm guessing the original mail was on gnupg-users; I'm not on that list
though I do read pgp-keyserver-folk.]
onak should handle all of these; if anyone has examples of keys that it
doesn't deal with then please do let me know the details.
I appreciate that the.earth.li [wwwkeys.uk.pgp.net] is probably the
only public keyserver running the code, but I do try to react to any
bug reports I receive.
It can be found at:
which also has details of the arch repository.
