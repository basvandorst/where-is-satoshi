Outlook Express is depreciated. In any case, the messages will probably
not display correctly in several MUAs, such as web based GMail, Juno,

Maybe not totally apropos to this discussion; however, I worked in
"traffic analysis" for several years. If given enough leeway, you would
be amazed at the information you can gather about an individual, and at
its astonishing accuracy rate.
Just listening on various mail forums, I have been able to learn more
about certain individuals than they would believe possible, or want
known. Its all in knowing (and having the proper equipment and
authority) in where to look.

I spent a great deal of time with HF/DF and its aerial variants. Fun
but boring. However, the sender is usually not the target of said
search, but rather the recipient. Locating the location of an enemy
combatant when the transmission is CQ is a whole new ball game.

System Info:
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.14
libgcrypt 1.4.4
gpa 0.9.0
I honestly have no idea what the problem is here. I am not even sure if
this is the correct mail forum to ask this question in. I recently
installed GnuPG on my system. Everything appeared to go fine. For some
reason, I have numerous keys listed that I have no knowledge of.
This URL shows the keys:
This is a screen shot when I attempt to delete a bogus key:
This is the error message displayed when I click to delete the key:
I have tried deleting the ~/gnupg directory and starting over; however
that does not correct the problem. I can delete keys I create though.
Where are these other keys coming from and how do I remove them

Perhaps not; however, it really messes up replying to a message since
all of that garbage should be removed prior to the transmission of the
replied to document.

OK, I found the source of those "unknown keys"
-r--r--r--    1 root  wheel    27K Jan 20 22:43 com-certs.pem
I renamed the file, deleted the "~/.gnupg/*.kbx" files and restarted GPA
and the problem disappeared. I still don't know what those 'certs' are
suppose to be for; however, the system seems to work fine without them.
Furthermore, prior to updating my system, those files were either not
available or not being loaded. I don't know which. If someone has a
clue, I would enjoy hearing about it.

@_subject: OT: Gpg4Win - recompile for 64bit MS Outlook 
I realize that this is probably not the correct forum to post this in;
however, I thought that perhaps someone here might have an answer.
According to this site:
old plug-ins will have to be recompiled for use in Windows-7 64-bit PC.
I was using Gpg4Win with Outlook on one workstation. All of the PCs are
going to be updated to Win-7 shortly, along with the installed
software. I understand that they are simply waiting for the release of
Office-10 to be released before the update. In any case, are their any
plans to recompile the plug-ins so that they will work under the new

It must be that time of year again; birds sing, flowers bloom and
broken 'vacation' message auto responders flourish. In any case, I am
calling the number he published. Maybe they can fix the 'vacation

Scenario 1:
He is the boss, therefore no harm is done.
Scenario 2:
He is not the boss; however, he is permitted to use company time on
private projects. Again, no harm is done.
Scenario 3:
He is not the boss, nor is he allowed to waste company time on private
projects. In this scenario, the company gains by outing an employee who
is wasting company resources and time on private projects.
No matter how you look at it, it is a "Win Win" situation.
