@_subject: gpg from scheduled task on Win2k

We are having trouble executing gpg.exe in a batch file that is executed
from a Scheduled Task on Windows 2000.  If the userid for the task is an
administrator, the task executes just fine.  But if the userid is of some
lesser domain account, Windows seems to refuse to execute gpg.exe (or it
stops it immediately) for there is no output to stdout.  We don't want to
use an admin account to execute this batch file.  Any ideas on what Windows
2000 security rights are necessary?
