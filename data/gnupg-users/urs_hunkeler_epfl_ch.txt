How can I use a GnuPG card on multiple computers?
My understanding is that when I let the card generate the keys, a stub for each key pair is automatically added to my keyring and instructs gpg to use the card to encrypt my messages. How can I add such stubs to my keyring on a different computer to point to existing keys on my card without having to regenerate the keys (which would render the card unusable for the first computer)?
