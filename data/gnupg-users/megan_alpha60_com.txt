@_subject: Importing RSA keys into GnuPG 
We have a rather interesting situation...
We are using a Cold Fusion tag to create RSA public and private
key pairs. We need to encrypt data using the the Cold Fusion tag
and decrypt it using the SCO version of GnuPG.
The problem seems to be that the Cold Fusion tag does not
generate the public and private keys as ASCII-armored and we
can't seem to get the keys to import into GnuPG. Below is an
example of what the CF tag is generating.
So basically our choices are to find a way to ASCII-armor keys
like those below to import into GnuPG or to generate new RSA keys
and strip the ASCII-armor off and convert them to a format (like
that below) that our Cold Fusion tag could recognize.
Does anyone have any idea of how this could work? Any help would
be appreciated beyond belief.
