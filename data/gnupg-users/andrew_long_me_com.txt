@_subject: Getting at a PGPDisk's contents 
Hi all. Bit of an embarassing question.
I used to have PGP Deskto, with whole disk encryption, installed (although my disk wasn?t encrypted).
I had created a ?PGPDisk? archive (and I still have the underlying file)
HOWEVER? As part of the upgrade process to El Capitan, I had to completely uninstall PGP and I no longer have it installed so I can?t directly access the contents of this encrypted archive.
Is there a way to square this circle?  i imagine that it?s something like an encrypted ZIP file.
Amy help will be appreciated.
Thank & Regards, Andy
