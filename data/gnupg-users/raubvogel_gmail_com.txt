@_subject: Is there a "-----END PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----" tag? 
============================== START ==============================
According to Clearsigned documents do not seem to have a ?"-----END PGP SIGNED
MESSAGE-----" tag. And yet there is a ?"-----END PGP MESSAGE-----" tag
for messages encrypted with gnupg. Am I missing something here?

So you entered the old passphrase and it cheerfully ignored you?

Well, everything has flaws and limitations. If we did not care
about addressing them, we would still be in loinclothes living in
caves. And, I do not think I look nice in loinclothes; they do not
match my eye colour.
      Also, isn't the point that technology keep evolving, as in for
each new threat there will also be a new defense for such threat.

Which is amusing since the old Blackberry also did that. At
least my Storm 2.
      Who is to say the TPM chip does not have a backdoor already?
      Also, Google already gets data from whoever uses its
services/software/hardware. Who is to day they too are not like
Microsoft and giving it to government agencies?
Now, the amusing thing is: had the FBI won, other nations would have a
valid precedent to demand the very same thing. If you remember, for a
while the Blackberry messaging system was considered highly secure if
both parties were using the BB enterprise thing. But then a few
countries forced RIM, who is smaller than Apple (and Canadian, which
automatically means less clout and money) to put servers in those
networks so they could decrypt the messages being sent.

I think a better example would be "I've never ate a pizza
before. Should I try it?"
      On the OP's defense, I do not think he understands enough of
multifactor authentication in general and smartcards vs other
alternatives specifically to answer the question. And this is probably
what he had in mind with his rather poorly worded original question.
      I will add that the "Are smartcards out of vogue?" question has
an loaded question taste to it. So, Will, what made you conclude that
smartcards are going the same place as 8-track and Betamax tapes?

Wasn't there also at least one company in Europe selling the
Ubuntu phones?

Stupid question: what is wrong with a "encrypt/decrypt old
format" flag/config option? If I have the need to use old stuff, I can
turn that on. All I see here is a "do not open old stuff" as a default
setting which should solve most issues.

As far as I know, the Amazon Smile (smile.amazon.com) is for non
profit orgs (I think that means 501(c)3), so if any of the groups you
mentioned are registered as non-profit, it does not take much to add
to amazonsmile. We (trilug.org) did that last year and would be
willing to help.

Another option is to buy a burner phone and SIM paying cash.
I've seen both available in stores and supermarkets and street stands
in at least 3 countries.

Personal experience US and Switzerland. I was told Canada, Vietnam,
and many African countries. Don't know of a list  though.

Going maybe on a tangent, how would those data retention
regulations play with GDPR?
