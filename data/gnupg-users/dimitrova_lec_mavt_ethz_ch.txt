@_subject: GPL license responsibility  
Dear GnuPG mailing list,
I have just downloaded GnuPG and I intend to use it for signing private metadata files. The signing process will happen through calling:
gpg --clearsign < ~/?./?./name_of_file.txt > name_of_file_signed.txt
from the command window directly and the verification process will happen in a standalone script which will pipe the command:
gpg --verify < name_of_file_signed.txt
I will not alter any part of the source code. In this case what are my obligations under the GPL license?
I would appreciate your response as I am new to using GnuPG and GPL licenced software.
