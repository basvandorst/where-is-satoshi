@_subject: SSH generic socket forwarding for gpg-agent 
I got the forwarding working, gpg-connect-agent says "connection to agent is
in restricted mode" and gives me a prompt. So am I all set? Doesn't seem
like that.
My GPG_AGENT_INFO is empty, as it is on my local machine where everything
works as expected (once my gpg-agent is running, has a key, and has created
its ~/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent -- and yes, now it also creates S.gpg-agent-extra
which I forward to)
So, on remote, "gpg --use-agent test.asc" gives me "gpg: decryption failed:
No secret key". But shouldn't this just work? Shouldn't it just get the
private/secret key from the (forwarded) socket? I tried pointing
GPG_AGENT_INFO at that socket as well, to no avail.

Oh, yes, I had just compiled a gpg 2.1.3 in my $HOME, because
the system had 2.0.14. BUT, the make install only gave me "gpg2"
in $HOME/bin and not a "gpg" -- so that was still in /usr/bin/gpg.
Of course I ended up using the latter for testing, inanely typing
just "gpg". With gpg2 it all works! Great. cd ~/bin; ln -s gpg2 gpg
