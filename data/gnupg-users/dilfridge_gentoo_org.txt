@_subject: Sunset of a smartcard encryption key 
Hi all, so here's a question that I'm sure people here have already been thinking about... Like probably many others here I have a gpg smartcard with three subkeys Sign, Encrypt, Authenticate, and an offline Certify master key at a safe place. * If I want to let my Signature subkey expire and generate a new one, that's not a big problem for me, since the public key is still available to everyone on the keyservers for verifying sigs.
* If I want to let my Auth subkey expire and generate a new one, well I just need to add the new one to all authorized_keys files in time.
But how do I sensibly handle a graceful sunset of an encryption key? If I replace the subkey on my card, I immediately can't read old e-mails anymore.
If I had the key in a file, I could keep the old, expired subkey around and still decrypt the data, but that would kinda defy the security provided by the My best idea so far is to generate a second token (Nitrokey, Yubikey or similar) *only* for old encryption subkeys, and additionally plug that in if I need to read an old message. Does anyone already have experience with such a Best,

[changing the subject since this is quite a different topic]
Well, that's the argument for having at least primary/cert key and encryption subkey not *only* on the smartcard but also in a safe place somewhere.
For a signature subkey it doesnt matter then if you lose it (just make a new one), and for an authentication subkey you need to prepare to have some alternative means of access (or also a backup).
