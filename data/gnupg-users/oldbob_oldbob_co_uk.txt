@_subject: GpgEX for 64 bit Windows test version 
On my Window 7 64bit system, GnuPG 1.4.13 installed itself in c:\Program
Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\  - the 32bit section. When I installed Gpg4win,
the installer offered install GPG2 in that same directory, but I added a
2 to keep the two separate, ie. it was installed in
c:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG2\
Your instructions above point to the \bin directory under the 64 bit
Program Files directory, not the 32bit. I assumed that I needed to have
gpgex.dll along with the other files and installed it in the \bin
directory with the rest of my gpg2 files ie. under
c:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG2\bin\gpgex.dll.
Should I have created a new directory under the 64bit Program File
directory just for the one new file?
When I ran
 regsvr32 c:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG2\bin\gpgex.dll
it just caused an error, saying "The module "c:\program" failed to load.
Make sure the binary is stored at the specified path or debug it to
check for problems with the binary or dependant .dll files. The
specified module could not be found."
It looks to me as though the regsvr command is looking for a program to
run called "c:\program"?
As I can't run the 32 bit version of GPGex anyway on this system, can I
not just overwrite the existing copy of gpgex.dll with the 64 bit one
and reboot?
What should I try if not, please?

That was my problem - thank you for the explanation.
I can see your points. I have only recently started using Linux, and the
command line functions are much more logical - however, using two sets
is even more confusing. Now I can't remember which way to slash :-) I
blame old age - but I get there in the end, with the help of my friends.
GpgEx is now working just fine. I used to use another explorer extension
( I forget the name - I think it used to be in Gpg4win?) which stopped
being developed so it will be handy to have one again.

Having finally solved my problem with installation, I've been trying
GpgEX this morning and so far all seems to be fine. I've tried all the
functions separately, and had no problems at all yet - obviously I'll
report back if I get any. Thanks for the help.

I put it in a separate directory in the end, so I should have the best
of both worlds. I don't think I have any 32bit processes in use - but
I'm covered anyway.
