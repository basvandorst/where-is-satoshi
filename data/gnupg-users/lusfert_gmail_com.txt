@_subject: Zero width no-break space (U+FEFF) in clearsigned output message 
Hash: RIPEMD160
Hi all.
I wrote some text (with non-ASCII characters) in file encoded in UTF-8
with BOM and save it.
Then I decided to clearsign it:
gpg --verbose -u 0x500B8987 --clearsign 1.txt
When I open clearsigned 1.txt.asc I can find symbol U+FEFF (Zero width
no-break space) before message, but after field "Hash:". Adding option
- -t does not change anything. But if source file is encoded in UTF-8
without BOM, character U+FEFF doesn't appear in output clearsigned text.
Why does symbol "zero width no-break space" appear if source file has
Unicode signature (BOM)?
Configuration: GnuPG 1.4.2 official build, WinXP Pro SP2, standard cmd.exe

As I understand GnuPG handles input as text file, not as plain text,
even if option -t used?
Thanks, I already do that. Now I understand why clearsigned via command
line UTF-8 with BOM text has BAD sig using WinPT or GPGshell: they just
can't handle Unicode...

How can I change text (not by manually editing) in armor headers (for
example, "Version:") or armor headers themselves (add, remove)? Will it
affect compatibility with other applications?
Can I put custom text into "Version:" in stage of exporting public key,
making signatures, encrypting with ASCII output, etc.?
Sometimes I do not wish that others will know what exactly OpenPGP
implementation and OS I'm currently using.

Hi all.
I recently encrypted (for testing purposes) 4,36 GB file using my public

I'm currenly using GnuPG 1.4.2 on WinXP SP2 and I have a problem:
When I write

I receive long output of hard readable characters and PC Speaker loud
beeping. I can stop this only by manual ending processes cmd.exe and

Is it possible to avoid this? For example, ask for an output location
(file, etc.) as gpg asks for recipient when he/she/it isn'n specified.
Also I didn't understand how to set up preferences for a key: allowed
and preferred ciphers, digest algorithms and compress methods. It is
possible to set up them using PGP Desktop 9.

@_subject: Date and time format 
Is it possible to change date format in GPG output?
When I see
D:\>gpg --verify gnupg-w32cli-1.4.3.exe.sig
gpg: Signature made 04/03/06 14:42:33
gpg:                using RSA key 0x1CE0C630
gpg: Good signature from "Werner Koch (dist sig) "
I don't understand what date does GPG mean:
? 4 March 2006?
? 3 April 2006?
? 6 March 2004?
When you see date 04/03/06 it's hard to guess what date format is used:
dd/mm/yy, mm/dd/yy, yy/mm/dd or even yy/dd/mm. By default I think it's 4
March 2006 because date format dd.mm.yy (dd.mm.yyyy) is used in my country.
Also GPG displays time (14:42:33) in such way when it's hard to guess is
it local or UTC.
Maybe it'll be better to see something like this:
D:\>gpg --verify gnupg-w32cli-1.4.3.exe.sig
gpg: Signature made 4-Apr-2006 14:42:33 (local - Russian Daylight Time)
gpg:                using RSA key 0x1CE0C630
gpg: Good signature from "Werner Koch (dist sig) "
D:\>gpg --verify gnupg-w32cli-1.4.3.exe.sig
gpg: Signature made 04-Apr-2006 10:42:33 UTC
gpg:                using RSA key 0x1CE0C630
gpg: Good signature from "Werner Koch (dist sig) "
or (maybe the best way)
D:\>gpg --verify gnupg-w32cli-1.4.3.exe.sig
gpg: Signature made 04 April 2006 14:42:33 (local - Russian Daylight Time)
gpg:                using RSA key 0x1CE0C630
gpg: Good signature from "Werner Koch (dist sig) "
Suggestions are welcome.
When I see output of PGPdump (  ) it's much more
easier to understand what date and time are shown and what time zone is

To revoke any key at first it's needed to generate a revokation certificate:
gpg --output [file] --gen-revoke [key id]
This operation requires passphrase for private key...
Thus it's strongly recommended to generate a revokation certificate at
once after creating a key and keep it in safe place. If you already have
an appropriate revokation certificate, simply import it into your keyring:
gpg --import [rev cert file]

@_subject: BZIP2 algorithm isn't supported after compiling gnupg from source 
I downloaded GnuPG source and checked its signature (under Windows):
Then I rebooted into recently installed Debian GNU/Linux 3.1r0a system
and built program from source:
$ cd /home/[user]/
$ bunzip2 gnupg-1.4.2.tar.bz2
$ tar xvf gnupg-1.4.2.tar
$ cd ./gnupg-1.4.2
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
After these steps command "gpg --version" displays the following:
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.2
Compression: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB
Before compiling (there was default gnupg installation from Debian
package) output of "gpg --version" was:
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.1
Compression: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB, BZIP2
Windows version (installed from official binaries) also supports BZIP2:
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.2
Compression: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB, BZIP2
Thus BZIP2 algorithm isn't supported after compiling GnuPG 1.4.2 from
source code under Linux.
How can I enable BZIP2 support using last version of GPG under Linux?

As I can see in armor header you are using _very old_ GnuPG version.
1.2.1 has a serious vulnerability, please update GnuPG immediately. For
details read this announcement:
Also from 1.2.1 to 1.4.2 (latest stable version) there were many
features added including support for various key servers.
Both key servers works fine for me.
At first, update GnuPG (see above why), then try again and if it won't
