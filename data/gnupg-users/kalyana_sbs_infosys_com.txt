@_subject: Installation of gnupg on Sun Solaris 
We are trying to install gnupg on Sun Solaris Box.
We are trying to figure out which version of C compiler is most suitable for compiling the source code on Solaris box.
The OS version is as follows:-
SunOS 5.10 sun4v sparc SUNW,SPARC-Enterprise-T5220
The version of gnupg that we are trying to install is 1.4.10.
Any inputs and pointers regarding the above will be highly appreciated.
Thanks and Regards,
