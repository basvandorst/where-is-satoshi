Hi! I think thats not the answer you awaited, but won't you just write a small shell script, that passes all the files in the current directory and the subdirs to gnupg in order to encrypt them?
Ciao, dominik

No, you're wrong.
KMail 1.3.1 is the latest stable release of Kmail. It's part of KDE 2.2.1 (also the latest stable KDE release).
To use gpg with Kmail you do the following:
- Create your public/private Key
- start KMail
+ SETTINGS
 + Configure KMail
  + Security

Ok. FREE Software (like Software covered by the GPL/BSD-Licence...) means FREE like 'freedom of speech'. Well and GnuPGShell is just 'free as beer' - that's it.
Most people out of the W32-world don't understand that, but the FREE Software is much more than just 'cheap'!!!

often it's no good idea to delete the old extension, you should keep it and simply add .gpg as additional extension.
Here's the script:
for i in *; do gpg -er RECIPIENT -o `echo $i`.gpg `echo $i`; done

as GUI-MUA i use KMail and i'm very happy with its GnuPG-functionality [althoug the current stable release only supports INLINE-PGP, but PGP-MIME should come soon]
For Keymanagement i use GPA.

@_subject: change the passphrase... 
Hi, how does the changing of the passphrase work? As it is possible to change the passphrase that means (to me) that the secretKey "knows" the passphrase.
In detail:
If i create a new key and set the password to e.g. "supersecret_1" and put a copy of that secretKey somewhere, than i change the passphrase to Am i right that it's now possible to use the first secretKey with the first passphrase  for signing/encryption  AS  WELL  AS  the second secretKey with its passphrase..?

@_subject: gpg: protection algorithm 254 is not supported 
i've got a small GnuPG Problem. using windows98 with gpg1.2.1-1 i've some problems with decrypting.
i've got 2 secret keys for 2 different email adresses. The older one has no problems in decrypting data, but when i try to decrypt anything, that was encrypted for the new key i get the following output:
C:\Programme\gnupg1.2.1-1>gpg -d test.asc
gpg: protection algorithm 254 is not supported
gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit ELG-E key, ID 2AB52944, created 2002-10-10
       "Dominik Schwald (nextbyte Software GmbH) "
gpg: public key decryption failed: unknown cipher algorithm
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
Of course the secret Key IS avaliable and ultimatively trusted...
What is wrong here?
Regards, dominik
PS: Using GNU/Linux i don't have any problems with 2 secret keys...
