@_subject: Random seed for symetric encryption 
I'm using gpg to symetrically encrypt a lot of files. Unfortunately,
gpg regularly complains about an empty random seed while processing.
Now I wonder why gpg needs random data for symetric encryption. Should
I care about the message or not? And how can I make it disappear?

I do have a public/private keypair which is regularly used. An the
random seed file actually exists. The warning is not always displayed
but only from time to time, just as if gpg ran out of randomness. So I
dare say that creating another keypair will not make it disappear,
will it?

Can't tell. It started as soon as I started encrypting lots of files
with symmetric encryption (means: about 1 week ago).  When I used
public key encryption before this never happened.

I did only the regular distribution updates.
Hmm. No, never saw the message there. On the other hand, maybe my MUA
is just hiding it. I'm using Gnus with PGG.
Yes, exactly. About 2 GB in 14000 files.
I don't have the exact message here at the moment, but I'm pretty sure
that it literally complained about an "empty random seed".    --Nikolaus

Hmm. Actually, yes. I didn't notice that until now, but they are up to
4 concurrent processes.
Ok, thanks a lot.
