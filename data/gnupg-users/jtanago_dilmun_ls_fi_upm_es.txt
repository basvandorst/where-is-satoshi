@_subject: [gnupg-users] Preferred hash algorithm when signing 
I've made various test and I've realized that the hash algorithm when signing is always SHA1, ignoring the preferred one. This doesn't happen when I encrypt+sign.

@_subject: [gnupg-user] Get secring path with command-line 
I want to get the secring path with a script, until now I used this command:
  $ gpg --secret-keyring /home/user/keyring/secring.gpg   /home/user/keyring/secring.gpg
  [......]
But if the keyring is empty I got no output.
There is another way to get this option?
