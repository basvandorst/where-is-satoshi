@_subject: Error decrypting: No secret key available 
This is likely a common error for new users, which I count myself amongst.  I
searched the forum and found issues similar to my own but the solutions did
not fix my problem.
THE SETUP:
I am using GPG 1.4.10 on a WinXP system.  I created my own key and imported
a client's key.  My key shows up under the gpg -K command as 974CE93B
The client's key shows up under the gpg --list-keys command as FC0919EA
I'm trying to encrypt an Excel file using the following command line:
gpg --compress-algo 1 --cipher-algo cast5 --local-user
myusrname at localuser.com -r myClient at myClient.com -o
C:\user\encrypt\out\myExcel.xls.gpg -se C:\user\encrypt\in\myExcel.xls
THE PROBLEM:
Once it is encrypted, neither the client or I can actually decrypt the file
again.  The error message reads:
No secret key available Keyring does not have the secret key
(0x5C3A5DB39FF7592C) needed to decrypt this message.
My assumption was that the secret key would've been 974CE93B, since it's my
signature.  Can someone point me in the right direction?

@_subject: Unable to decrypt/verify from own machine 
The Setup
I run Windows XP using GnuPG version 1.4.10.  A client and I have exchanged our keys.  I successfully imported his key and
attempted to encrypt a file to send him.  My command line is as follows:
gpg --passphrase mypassphrase --compress-algo 1 --cipher-algo cast5 -u
me at myemail.com -r client at hisemail.com -o
C:\user\encryption\out\targetFile.xls.gpg -se
The Problem
When trying to decrypt or verify the encrypted file, I get the following
No secret key available Keyring does not have the secret key
(0xA352B4E9003B38FA) needed to decrypt this message.
My key's ID is 1F1EA8F8 and the client's ID is 5872AF6A.  I have no idea why
it would be asking for A352B4E9003B38FA.
This is likely a beginner's mistake, but I'm at a loss!
