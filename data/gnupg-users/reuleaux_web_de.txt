@_subject: manual for gpgme 
This is what I did (I am new to this list however, so more
experienced people might have better answers):
download the source code of gpgme, cd into the directory,
there is a doc directory in there, with some Makefile stanza Makefile.am
or the like.
I ran   $ ./configure from the main directory (the one above doc),
just so that the real Makefile was produced in doc
I also had to also install libgpg-error-dev (I am on Debian squeeze),
  # apt-get install libgpg-error-dev
so that the ./configure would go through smoothly
(just as if I had wanted to really build gpgme, I happen to feel
more comfortable however, if everything - the Makefile in this case - is built automatically)
Then (with a Makefile in doc), I ran   $ make pdf
there, complains still about texi2dvi not being found on my
system, fixed that by installing
  # apt-get install texinfo
and there you go:   $ make pdf
should work now.
hope this helps,
  -Andreas
