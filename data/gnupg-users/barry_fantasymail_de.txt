GnuPT the installer works, but the WinPT-Zipfile not?
But this is very strange (on your system)
The paths accordingly, would be the smallest problem...

(Original quote from the german GnuPP mailing list)
recently introduced a new version GnuPT published.
New in this version:
WinPT was to version 1.3.0 update.
The main change in WinPT expected the merger of the two authors
GnuPT and WinPT of his.
The new official site of WinPT reads: It was also already been the site offered GnuPT
Chm file to WinPT-integrated. This is now called by F1.
In addition, many small bug fixes.
Anyone GPGrelay want to use this also in German, along
German CHM file on the GnuPT homepage. This allows everyone to
special package after tie together its own needs.
There is also offered portable version of GnuPT was also
updated. What is new is the possibility here directly to the virtual
Care of Windows - something very practical and safe in foreign
PC's :-)

yesterday a new GnuPT-Version has been released.
Changelog for WinPT:
The swapped hotkey situation was not 100% solved. This version also
adjust the code to associate the keys for each hot key.
Updated the libgpg-error component to 1.6.0.2.
The passphrase control does now *allow* to paste text into the field.
Swapped hotkey for the clipboard (encrypt, decrypt). The issue is now fixed.
Fix a problem that keyserver which are marked as deleted are still
displayed in the Key Manager context menu.
Fix wrong prefix for added keyserver entries. Now it is hkp:// by
default. The only exception is a port 80 entry which means The new data transport format is UTF-8. This step is important for
people who exchange encrypted message but they do not use the same
charset. WinPT handles the case automatically, which means all clipboard
data send to GPG is encoded in UTF-8 and all data we get back from GPG
is decoded from UTF-8 into the locale charset. If external software is
used, and the text contains 8-bit characters, no US-ASCII, the software
is responsible for decoding the UTF-8 data into the locale setting. This
should be the default case today.
