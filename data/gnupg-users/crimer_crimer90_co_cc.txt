Hash: SHA512
Hi Adam,
2011/11/8 Adam :
gpg2 (and gpg 1 the same) by default creates a 'certificate' with two keys,
one for signing/certifying and the other for encryption. Actually, this
'certificate', composed by a master signing key and an encryption subkey,
is what is generally called 'key'.
There are some reasons behind this choice, I think the main one is because
it's safer to manage different keys for different needs. You can have only
a signing key for authenticate the messages you sent and, at the same time,
have more than one encryption key to enhance your security.
You can, for instance, revoke an encryption key if you think it's
compromised or if you want to change it because it's superseded or what
you want... while keeping working your signing one, validating what you
sign, independently.
About the self-signature:
Your 'certificate' is an association between your cryptographic keys and
your identities. The self-signature is what makes this 'magic' work, thus
binding the two in a strong and verifiable relationship.
Without it, someone could, for example, add other uids to your key without
any problem, and it could be dangerous for the whole functioning of the
web of trust.
There's also a 'key-binding signature' between your master key and your
subkeys, for the same important reason.
Hope it helps. :-)

Hash: SHA512
Hello veidaal and gnupg-users list.
To achieve your desired result, it's required to run the exactly same
compiler, including the version, with the same options targeting the
correct architecture. Also a minor tweak in architecture settings
could change the result, see for example the --march and --mtune
directives of GCC to see how many choices there are.

Hash: SHA512
Hi zerious,
First of all:
The following answer is about "how to get those informations from an
encrypted message".
If you need to force some algorithms, you can use the --cipher-algo,
--digest-algo, --compress-algo and --cert-digest-algo options.
The informations you're seeking for are inside the ciphertext, precisely:
a) the symmetric encryption algorithm is with the key, in the
symmetric-key encrypted session key packet;
b) the digest algorithm is inside the one-pass signature packet,
inside the symmetric ciphertext.
So, you have to decrypt the Symmetric-Key Encrypted Session Key Packet
with your public key to discover the crypto-algo and get the session
key to decrypt the Symmetrically Encrypted Data Packet and get or a
Compressed Data Packet or a Literal Data Packet, along with the
one-pass signature cited above.
Exactly, that's the way to follow to discover the symmetric encryption
algorithm using only GnuPG.
You can use the --list-packets option, along with the
--show-session-key one, to see a detailed view of your packet. Let's
see an example:
$ gpg --list-packets --show-session-key message.asc (or .gpg)
:pubkey enc packet: version 3, algo 1, keyid 0123456789ABCDEF
        data: [4096 bits]
:encrypted data packet:
        length: unknown
        mdc_method: 2
gpg: encrypted with ...
:compressed packet: algo=3
:onepass_sig packet: keyid FEDCBA9876543210
        version 3, sigclass 0x00, digest 10, pubkey 1, last=1
:literal data packet:
        mode b (62), created 1316543985, name="",
        raw data: 6 bytes
:signature packet: algo 1, keyid FEDCBA9876543210
        version 4, created 1316543985, md5len 0, sigclass 0x00
        digest algo 10, begin of digest dd 90
        hashed subpkt 2 len 4 (sig created 2011-09-20)
        subpkt 16 len 8 (issuer key ID 10293847586FDBCE)
        data: [4096 bits]
gpg: session key:
You can see:
- - RSA key (pubkey algo 1);
- - the symmetric algo used is AES256 (9, first octet of session key);
- - the message is compressed with BZIP2 (compressed algo 3)
- - the digest algo is SHA512 (10 in signature and onepass_sig packets);
- - the signature asymmetric algo is RSA (algo 1 in signature).
Of course, you need a way to decipher that message, so if you're
encrypting it without a key of yours, those informations are
I don't know any tool to analyze encrypted data as you want, I'm sorry.
If you want to discover more insight details about the informations
stored inside an OpenPGP message, you can look at RFC4880, it's very
exhaustive. ;)
Hope it helps!

@_subject: Gnupg2 Install on Solaris 10 Problem. 
Hash: SHA512
Hi Priya,
I'm not an expert of Solaris 10 on Sparc architecture, however I might
have found your problem in the procedure you followed.
That's true, libgcrypt depends on libgpg-error.
What I'm seeing here (and what I'm reading from your procedure) is
that you didn't do the "make install" pass. That's why your
./configure script can't find the library on the system.
It'll be useful only if the directory you added is the one which
contains the library file. Search in subdirectories!
You can resolve this issue by installing the library with make
install. Of course, if you want to make your system clean from that
external software, you can set the installation path with the --prefix
parameter at ./configure.
See above.
Hope it helps. Forgive me if I wrote something wrong for Solaris...
Regards and good luck,
