@_subject: Outlook 2003 problem 
Hi, I am a new user to GnuPG plugin for Outlook and I have a small problem.
Whenever I send a PGP encrypted email, it arrives completely empty and the
sent item is also empty.
Does anyone have any suggestions?
I followed the setup instructions here:
My current software is:
Windows XP SP1
Outlook 2003
GnuPG Plugin v0.91
WinPT v0.7.96rc1
GnuPG v1.2.1
