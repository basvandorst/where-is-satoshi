@_subject: local-key and key on keyserver seems to differ 
Hi folks,
maybe my question is silly, but I don't understand, why the ASCII
output fom my localy stored puplic key differs from that one I
get from the pgp.mit.edu webinterface.
The fingerprint is the same.
Is this normal?

@_subject: update between pgp.mit.edu and keyserver.net 
Hi folks,
maybe you already know this, but on other lists it had caused
some confusion. So I wanna post it here.
It's an answer to a mail that I sent to pgp.mit.edu and also to
keyserver.net, but only pgp.mit.edu has replied to it.
The answer was addressed to me and to keyserver.net.
[answer from pgp.mit.edu]
So IMHO it might be better, not to use keyserver.net at the moment,
because it seems that they do no updates with other keyservers.
