@_subject: File Extensions supported by GnuPG 
By convention the extension .gpg is used for encrypted/binary data and .asc or .sig is used for detached or clearsign signatures.
The extension doesn't really matter since it is only by convention that these extensions are used. However, it is recommended to use .sig or .asc for signatures and .gpg for binary data (such as encrypted files) so the recipient knows what to expect.  In addition, when verifying, GPG expects the source data in a file without the .asc or .sig extension (otherwise you usually have to point GPG to the source data to verify against.)  For all GPG cares you could use .jpg for the file extension of signed/encrypted data (but I highly recommend against this!)
I've indicated the default file extensions below with a short gpg example that generates files with these defaults. I've used "--default-recipient-self" to cause any encryption operation to encrypt to your own key.
.gpg is the conventional extension, and is automatically used as in the following command:
`gpg -e --default-recipient-self test_file.txt`
For creating a detached signature the extensions .sig or .asc are standard with .sig being the gpg default as in the following sample:
`gpg --detach-sign test_file.txt`
When using clear text signatures (where ASCII armored text denotes the start and end of the original message and signature elements) .asc is the default extension as in the following sample:
`gpg --clearsign test_file.txt`
When used only with the --sign option the original data will be included in the binary result and the default extension is .gpg
The conventional extension for a signed and encrypted messages is .gpg and the resulting file will contain both the encrypted message as well as the signature. The following example will create a signed & encrypted .gpg file:
`gpg -s -e --default-recipient-self test_file.txt`
As long as you call GPG in a valid manor you can use any extension you want, although I'd suggest using the conventional extensions for ease of use and best understanding.
Also note that OS's that operate on a file based on its extension (such as Windows) may take different actions depending on the extension in use.
Hope this helped!

Generally those who use GPG never intend to provide a 3rd party access to an encrypted message.  However, in the event you find yourself forced to disclose a message or face legal consequences, you have the option to disclose a specific message encrypted to you without providing your private key.  The --show-session-key option will provide the static key used for encrypting that message without compromising any past or future content encrypted with that key.
