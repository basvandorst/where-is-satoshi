For whatever reason I now have two versions of my private key one
without the ELG encryption key and primary key, the other without the
RSA signing key.
How can I combine them so I have one secret key with both the ELG and
RSA subkeys under the primary key.
This is my new key

How do I copy the key 4436432A to my primary key BE7E87FD, as my new key
lacks the primary key and the encryption key 3173413E.

Thanks for trying this did not work either, however, I managed to expire
the signing keys and create a new one.
I now have my primary, encryption and signing key that work!

I have a question about paperkey, bearing in mind that this application
may not always be available can one restore the secret key just using
the printed paperkey and the public key from keyservers manually.
Otherwise if I know I can always get a copy of the application from a cd
or usb isn't that the same a keeping my secret key on cd or usb.

Can you explain the instructions, do you just add the octets to the end
of the public key.  Is this the same with multiple subkeys.

I seem to be having some problems using the papertest key provided with
the application (attached) and the associated key to create a paperkey I
have extracted the following octets for each key and subkey.
Key 1
FE 03 03 02 56 AC A0 3D F2 14 48 D2 60 22 90 E7 0A 58 94 51 F7 3D
5B 2A 4D 9C 26 B9 C1 AF 27 34 D3 D0 95 FE 69 9A C8 7D A4 E8 00 4E
9A 52 11 E9 C3 68 E4 BC E7 0E B2 15 D8 47 8A 6A 19 95 A6
Key 2
FE 03 03 02 56 AC A0 3D F2 14 48 D2 60 91 84 44 F2 DB A1 1A E8 0E
D4 72 82 18 FB E6 B6 85 6A 32 F6 15 E9 89 1C 7F 55 DD D5 45 EE 11
E7 DE 44 4C 2B 5B EB 2C 30 91 1E 1F F0 03 6A 2C 30 AD 55 90 6C D0
9F 39 7C E7 53 06 F2 BE F7 AE 1B A1 DE A2 1A 58 8A C5 2C
Key 3
FE 03 03 02 33 E6 5A 12 FA 15 D4 24 60 91 E7 D2 F8 74 2D DB 04 38
78 DC 6B C8 A2 AC 25 6D 5D 6B DE E5 01 F8 12 19 D5 DB 33 16 2E A5
C2 AA 9E AA 72 AB 8B 3B 4D D1 9D B5 6C EF E1 31 BF 99 19
Using a hex-editor I have then appended these octets to the public key
to give me the attached file.  This is not the same as the secret key
and cannot be imported as a secret key.
What is wrong with this process.

One you have split your key with gpgsplit do you just then add the relevant secret key packets to each key part and then cat them back together.

You can't take a public key and just attach the blob to the end.  A  secret key is made up of secret key packets.  You need to convert your  individual public key packets to secret key packets.  Split the public  key into packets, convert the individual packets, then reassemble the  Run "paperkey --file-format" and it will print out some pointers on  how to do this.

The hexidecimal approach works well for a whole secret key. I tried this with the OCRA font and appears to work very well and means that you do not need to get the public key from keyservers.
Using this method my secret key printed comes to two sides of A4.  Hex is easier to re-enter and this way can recreate your public key.

Consider keepassx from  it is cross platform mac, win and linux and opensource. Fully compatible with I have used it for a few years and it is also available on WM5 and as a portable app for use when out and about.
