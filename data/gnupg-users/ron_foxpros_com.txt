@_subject: GnuPG Keys 
I am looking for a way to integrate the GnuPG Security encryption into my
VFP 7 application.
It will allow clients to send secure messages via the Internet.  Does anyone
know of a DLL that I can use to process the calls?
I need a way to generate Keys and Export them without using a command line.
If you know of a library that will do this please let me know.
I am sorry if sounds like a newbie question.  I am I have never used this

@_subject: passphrase 
Another newbie question.
Is there a way to pass the passphrase to the gpg command line?
or Is there a way to not need a passphrase?

Ahhh... That was the ticket. After changing my passphrase I no longer get the IDEA warning on my machine without IDEA. Thanks!

@_subject: FW: Diminished Disk Space after running file encryption 
Behalf Of Richard Turner

I posted a few days ago.  Problem was my disk space plumetted after
running GnuPG under WinPT (under Win 98SE) and remained very low (posted
a few days ago).
I have found where the disk space went - I think!  As I mentioned I was
running GnuPG from WinPT which I invoked from a file management program
called Directory Opus (via a right click of the mouse - menu - select
WinPT options etc.).  I have just found six files totalling 1,477 Mb in
the Opus program files directory all created on the day I started having
the problems with similarly prefixed names (to each other) and sizes
similar to the files that I was encrypting/trying to encrypt.  I have
renamed these and run the Opus program with no ill effects.  I do not
know why the Opus program itself did not list these files when I
searched (using it!) for files greater than 50Mb as the smallest is 160Mb.
Anyway I have now deleted them all and regained my spare capacity - and enhanced as I was forced to clear out a load of other stuff to get some free space!
Many thanks to all that tried to help - I'm still unsure why these files
were created and left on the system but at least I know where to look
from now on!

I've downloaded the source of 1.2.2 and did:
sh configure --prefix=/usr
configure says:
checking whether to enable external keyserver helpers... yes
checking whether LDAP keyserver support is requested... yes
But make doesn't build the file in keyserver/. Doing a make in this
directory just says nothing to do. After make of the whole package,
keyserver/ looks like:
drwxrwsrwx    3 root     root         4096 Jul 22 12:52 .

How can I build gpgkeys_ldap.c?
