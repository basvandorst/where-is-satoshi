@_subject: Complete Ubuntu compile of GnuPG 
Dear Werner,
Could you give me (a gnupg newbie) clear instructions to compile the latest version for Ubuntu 16.04.3?
I?m running it as a VM in VirtualBox on my Mac.
Also I need you advice on my keys. Now I have rsa2048 but want to switch to rsa4096. What?s the best way of doing? Migrate or delete & create a new one? On the other hand I?ve noticed you have rsa2048. Maybe just keep rsa2048?
P.S. I have been happily using GnuPG 2.1.22 on my Mac, which I installed as binary. Now it?s time to move on with building my own like a pro) on Linux

    These are also not needed because the speedo Makefile will download and
    use ntbtls instead.

Hi Werner,
yes, i am.
*I just manually compiled it on the fresh install of ubuntu 16.04 per
the below script:*
cd ~/Downloads
wget wget tar xf $version.tar.bz2
cd $version
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libldap2-dev
sudo apt-get install -y gtk+-2
sudo apt-get install -y rng-tools
sudo apt-get install -y libbz2-dev
sudo apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libgmp-dev
sudo apt-get install -y nettle-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libgnutls28-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libsqlite3-dev
sudo apt-get install -y adns-tools
sudo apt-get install -y libreadline-dev
sudo apt-get install -y qtbase5-dev
sudo apt-get install -y pinentry-gtk2
sudo apt-get install -y pcscd scdaemon
sudo make -f build-aux/speedo.mk INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
speedo_pkg_gnupg_configure='--enable-g13 --enable-wks-tools' native
sudo ldconfig
# use nano to create a configuration file: nano ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
# add the line: pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-gtk-2
# chmod 600 ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
*the result is the following:*

*then I imported my existing keys for the other machine*

however after installing Enigmail I get this error when I try to attach
my public key to the message
thank you for your time to this matter

dear all,
thank you for your time and help
problem solved by configuring Enigmail to use the new gnupg location in
the default setting /usr/bin/gpg2)

Hi Peter,
thank for your attention to this smallest problem of mine which I
wouldn't even hope to have your attention for to begin with)
my bad, I should have started a new thread, well noted
on the other hand that's probably why I suddenly had all the big gnupg
minds helping me)
what a rewarding side effect of unwittingly breaking the housekeeping rules)
seriously now ...
it was a fresh ubuntu 16.04 install
it came with gnupg 1.4.20 and 2.1.11
i compiled gnupg 2.2.4
it worked just fine in terminal and after configuring Enigmail with the
new gpg location works there as well
do you think i still have a problem?
thank you

Hi Peter,
i thought you forgot about me)
thank you for your very detailed response
I have a confession to make, too. Not only I'm not a developer, but I'm
a fresh convert from os to linux). And it all started last year when I
stumbled upon gnupg just looking for a proper way to encrypt a flash drive)
Correct me if I'm wrong but the best conclusion I could make for your
letter is that unless I locally build a Debian package myself (the
epitome of thoroughness!), I can't be 100% sure everything works as it
If that's the case. I do want to give it a shot but I doubt I can do it
without step-by-step guide without breaking something). I guess it must
be boring for you to dedicate more of your time on this, but I can't
help but asking to provide one for me in hope that there are some more
inexperienced GNU/Linux users on this mailing list who might be very
much interested in building the epitome of thoroughness themselves but
just too shy to ask for guidance)

thank you for being patient with super noobs like me
hope you will find some time to build those packages
in the meantime I'll keep on learning GnuPG
by the way distro-packaged 2.1.11 in /usr/bin/gpg2 and freshly compiled
2.2.4 in /usr/local/bin/gpg live peacefully together on my ubuntu 16.04
machine to date
however I don't get to do much with it so far except for encrypt/decrypt
correspondence and files, edit/export/import keys to other machines,
backup, etc.

Dear GnuPG Experts,
Can I please have your opinion on using Ledger Nano S as a PGP smart card?
In search for an optimal PGP smart card for my Android phone I came

I would like to set it up the following way on my Android phone:

Dear Chiraag,
I've been thinking of a similar setup with my GPG keys on a smart card
to encrypt/decrypt data on my android phone.
Could be more specific about your setup?
