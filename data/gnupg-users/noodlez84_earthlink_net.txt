no. pgp imports it automatically and informs you (with a pop-up dialog) that secret keys have been imported.

@_subject: RIJNDAEL / AES 
Hash: SHA1
i'm a big advocate of open-standards, and it's only natural that i
jumpted on the RIJNDAEL bandwagon.  i currently have the following two
lines in my ~/.gnupg/options :
cipher-algo RIJNDAEL256
s2k-cipher-algo RIJNDAEL256
however, RIJNDAEL is pretty new, and that standing, it has not
withstood the scrutiny for as long as something a little older like
CAST5 (which i've used previous of AES).  then again, if it's good
enough for the NSA, it's good enough for me.
is my rationale correct?  am i doing the right thing?
neat pick: PGP 7.0.3 says the cipher is AES-128.  I thought i'm using
RIJNDAEL_256_ ...  i read somewhere PGP 7.0.3 isn't RFC2440 compaint. is this the reason?
also, what's the difference between RIJNDAEL256 , RIJNDAEL192, and
just plain RIJNDAEL ?
thank you for everyone's time.

Hash: SHA1
i feel your pain :)  i gave up on PGP 7.0.3 when it refused to import
one of my two secret keys.  i've had hell even with previous versions
of pgp: similar situation, gpg would work perfectly with pgp; not
here's my options file:
force-v3-sigs # need this; even version 7.0.3 doesn't support v4 sigs
escape-from-lines    # recommended
utf8-strings    # recommended
compress-algo 1  # uses zlib compression, which was (is?) used by pgp;
haven't tried RFC1950 compression with pgp 7.0.3
cipher-algo RIJNDAEL256        # as previously stated, i'm a big
advocate of standards; chosen as AES by the NSA; used CAST5 before.
s2k-cipher-algo RIJNDAEL256
the error message you receive i also received if i used the BLOWFISH,
the gpg default (?)l since pgp doesn't support it, all my encrypted
files would NOT decrypt with pgp (i got the same exact error message
as you do now).  fixed by using CAST5 instead.
two in short, two suggestions:
1. use compression type 1
2. switch to CAST5 / AES

Hash: SHA1
i believe i've had your problem (invalid line break after SHA1).
the answer is @ keith ray distributes IDEA-enabled GnuPG binaries for win9x.

Fix: Incorrect CrLf after "Hash: SHA1" header. Will be included in
next official release.
btw, there's a new version of gnupgshell, 1.30 :

@_subject: secret key compromised? 
Hash: SHA1
i exported my secret key so i could import it into another
computer (i wanted to sign / decrypt @ another computer).
however, someone managed to get a copy of that exported key.
should i be worried?  a secret key isn't usable without the
passphrase... and I have a pretty good one.
what do you guys think?

heh, no.  it isn't my program.  the author's name is roger sondermann
(r.so  i can't program at all (just learning c++).
the disappearance of the the gnupg console window is not a flaw in
gnupgshell.  my default, the console is set to "close on exit."  to
counteract that behavior, edit the properties of  'command.com' (usually in
c:\ and c:\windows).  in the 'program' tab is the option: uncheck 'close on
while winpt is under the gpl, gnupgshell is proprietary (the README in the
gnupgshell zip file has a short explanation why).  this difference in
philosophy will prolly prohibit future collaboration.
major difference between winpt / gnupgshell (for those curious souls):
while winpt has its own interface (uses gpgme library functions, right?),
gnupgshell is simply a /frontend/, in the strictest sense of the word.  it
appears it simply runs commands and sends text to the gpg binary. therefore, anything gpg can't do, gnupgshell can't (an example is keyserver
access: it hasn't been implemented in the win32 version).

yup...  note: gnupgshell is stable and only has one or two relatively crucial features missing (keyserver access comes to mind).  winpt is not stable nope...  just make sure you read the README that comes with the program.  do you want to maintain pgp compatibility?  if so, make sure you have the following lines in your options file (typically c:\gnupg\options):

if i remember correctly, this error is caused by gnupg 1.0.4 if the rijndael cypher algo is used.  it's nothing to get worried over, and has already been fixed in cvs.
