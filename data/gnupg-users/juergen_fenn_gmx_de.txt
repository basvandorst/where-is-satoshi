Sounds strange to me... but, then, I am not a security pro...
I have used GnuPG with Gnus under Win98SE for quite a while now. I
have not experienced any problems with other users running the more
"professional" applications, e.g. mutt. However, I did not succeed to
communicate with a user running enigmail under Linux because we did
not manage to get the German special characters right. We did not
manage to find out what this was due to. We just gave up.
Thanks for your report.
