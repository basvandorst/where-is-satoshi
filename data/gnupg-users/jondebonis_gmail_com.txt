@_subject: What's the encryption flow? 
Is there a document or diagram that explains how encryption happens?
This is what I assume from rand_key = GenerateRandomKey(bits)
rand_key_e = E_pk(rand_key)
cypher_text = E_rand_key(plain_text)
unsigned_message = headers + rand_key_e + cypher_text
... sign message...
Where E_pk === encrypt with public key (asymmetric);
  E_rand_key === encrypt with random_key (symmetric);
Using user-specified ciphers.
