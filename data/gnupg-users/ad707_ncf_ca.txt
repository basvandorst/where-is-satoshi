Thanks for the information.  I had no idea.  I'll give it a try.
    If you just want to avoid typing the passphrase N times, i suggest
    to use gpg-agent, which is the greatest invention since syrup on
    pancakes.

@_subject: Am I attempting the impossible? 
============================== START ==============================
I have a number of files that I would like to protect that I (tend to) open simultaneously and I would like to do that (and protect them again) with a single command line instruction like:
gpg -c filename1.ods, filename2.odb, file/...
and thereby only enter 1 passphrase for all of them.
I couldn't find any information but have been playing around with commas, semi-colons and the like ... and I have come up empty.
I would think it surprising that gpg doesn't support what I am trying to do but, in the lack of any information, who knows.
Can anyone help?
