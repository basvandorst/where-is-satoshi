@_subject: generate key using specific cipher 
I'm trying to learn how to use gpg/libgcrypt with GOST cryptography (actually I'm moving from openssl, where GOST is deprecated due to poor code quality to the gpg/libgcrypt software, where GOST is present since 1.7.0), and since the entire crypoto subsystem is (from my point of view) is overcomplicated, I'm lacking some simple skills - for instance, how do I generate an x509 csr/key with GOST (is it even possible) ? In openssl I would do something like "openssl req -newkey gost2001 -pkeyopt paramset:A -keyout foo -out bar" and this would do the trick. In gnupg.... well, I'm looking at the documentation right now but just cannot find the clue.
