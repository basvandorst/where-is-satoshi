shouldn't gpg understand commandline args without them being in certain
set orders?  it took me forever to realize that you can't do gpg --armor --encrypt filename.doc -r while you *can* do
gpg --armor -r  --encrypt filename.doc
and i did figure out that you could specify multiple users with more than
one -r, but this wasn't documented anywhere so i don't know if this means
bad things, or if it is untested, or what.
and you can't import keys from a keyserver by name, which is
understandable, but wouldn't it be nice if you could search for keys and
get a listing of keyID's you can fetch?  gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys "Happy Boy" could bring back a listing of the keyIDs it has for people named happy
i also have a problem when using pgp4pine with gpg where after it verifies
messages they're double-spaced.  but i haven't figured out yet if its
gpg, pgp4pine, or pine that does this yet.
thanks for the soapbox.
        b0ing!                          /* pgp key available via finger */

No idea.  As I do not use it, I cannot comment on it.
I would imagine that it suffers from a variety of problems.  The GNU/Linux OS's out there seem to think everyone cares what version of gettext they're running, or what openssl release they use.
Nobody cares.  YOU may care.  I may care.  But we're an insignificant portion of the population using computers.  People want an update system to be easy and painless.  "The core components of your Computer are out of date, and your computer is getting the proper updates to these components to assure smooth and safe operation," are all my Mother and Sisters would ever want to see.  You think it's bad being the family Computer Guy when they install a scanner?  How about when they're installing 25 updated binaries and libraries to fix a buffer overrun in something called "libgtk2"?
I'm finding it more and more difficult to remain on-topic for this list and obviously everyone else is too.  I'm not sure what proper protocol is for that, so I ask that if you want a reply to something on-list try to keep it related to the original topic?  It will only confuse people digging through archives later.
