I got a problem with GnuPG and PGP 5.0:
Also PGP 5 accepts my key, it is not possible for PGP 5 to encrypt with my key. It?s not even displayed in the selection dialog when I try to encrypt something (it shows identities correct in key list (but expiration not)).
I read in the FAQ that PGP 5.0 does not accept ElGamal keys of type 20, but my key doesn?t seem to be of that type (--list-packets says "version 4, algo 16, created 1153340019, expires 0")
There seem to be another problem, do you have any idea how to solve it?
In case you?re wondering, I do have PGP only for testing purpose, because I can?t get EUMEL of the 1822direkt bank (a system that sends you a OpenPGP encrypted mail with financial transactions on your account) to work, they use PGP 5.0.

I got the latest GnuPG. The bank uses "PGP 5.0 for OS/2", unfortunately I can?t change that.
But I possibly found out the problem: I exported several public keys I had to PGP 5 and tried to use them for encryption. Some of them worked, and some (including mine) not. I analyzed the keys with --list-packets and found out, that the keys that doesn?t work, contain "key flags" (subpacket 27).
Unfortunately I haven?t found out how to remove this from my key, is there a (simple) way to do that?
But that doesn?t mean PGP 5 is insecure in any way, it?s just outdated and not RFC2440 conform, right?

That?s exactly what I did to see what I have in my key, and the key flags won?t be removed no matter what I do.
I also added "tty_printf(_("do_add_key_flags was called.\n"));"
at the begin of the function (the only command in the function at all). I see this message only during the creation of a new key (two times), but never when I edit one.

I patched gpg and was able to create several keys without key flags (and PGP 5 accepted all of them), but I wasn?t able to remove them from my key, I changed the expire time several times, but no luck.
Any ideas?
