@_subject: gen-key on msys (mingw): nothing happens 
Hi all,
Just installed gpg version 1.2.4 on msys (mingw) on Win 2003 server.
When trying gpg --gen-key, nothing happens. Same effect both in the
precompiled version and when compiling the sources. gpg --help etc work
fine; so it seems there is a problem with tty_printf, but maybe not.
Anyone here knows what to do about this?

@_subject: Cannot generate keys on msys 
Hi all,
As I wrote a week ago
I do not seem to be able to generate keys or get any useful response
from gpg beyond --version and --help options. Could someone point me to
the right direction so I could fix this?
