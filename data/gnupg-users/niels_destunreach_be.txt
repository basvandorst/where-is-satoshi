Or put another way:
If you're running a computer at 3.2K (ambient universe temperature,
anything below that would require additional energy to cool it), a
bit-flip requires 4.41E-23 Joules of energy.
According to Wikipedia, the world produces "only" 20 279 640 GWh of
elecrical power per year = 7.3E19 Joules. This is enough to count
through a 139-bit counter. Only count through, not even do any
calculations with it!

@_subject: influence of signature type on trustdb 
I'm trying to figure out what the influence is of the different
signature types (0x10-0x13). As far as I can tell, they only _indicate_
the signers trust in his own sig, but isn't used in any way by GPG. Is
this correct?
I was hoping it would be used in the trust model, but apparently only
the ownertrust (and optionally tsign's) are used there.
Thanks in advance,

@_subject: influence of signature type on trustdb 
OK, would it make sense to use this level in the trust calculation?
Similar to the `marginal` ownertrust: three type 0x12 sigs equivalent to
one type 0x13 sig? With the numbers configurable, preferably.
I guess this would make the trustdb calculations a little more
complicated, because both ownertrust and siglevel need to be taken into
account, but to me it feels like a "better" way.
Or am I missing some obvious reasons why this is a bad idea?

Ok, I'll put "write another trust model" on my todo-list. But not under
the "I need this badly" section. Rather under "If I have nothing more
useful to do".
Over the past few days' I've been thinking about it, and it seems to be
a very complex problem. Mostly because the quantitiy involved (trust) is
not very well defined (which I consider a feature in general, but a bug
in this particular context).

I use  from time to time. It does render a picture
of the different trust-paths it found, including the sig-type
(although I don't find the sig-type particularly intuitive).
To depict the trust model, the ownertrust should be added on top

@_subject: Smartcard & reader with pin-pad: working combo? 
I've been reading up on smartcard usage lately. I currently store my
master key offline, and only bring it online when I need it (signing
other keys, or generating new subkeys). Moving the private key to a
smartcard seems to only offer security increases, with little to no
Which brings me to my main question: I'm thinking of buying this
smartcard: OpenPGP SmartCard V2
together with this reader: SCM SPR-332
And would like to get this to work on my MacBook Pro with 10.6.8 (snow
leopard). I'm not afraid to compile from applications from source, but
would prefer not to mess with kernel modules.
How likely is it that this is going to work? The card seems to be
supported by GnuPG, even for 4096RSA keys (which I plan to use). But I'm
not sure about the card reader.
I wanted to get a cardreader with pinpad. That way even a compromised
computer can't sign arbitrary data. (It can substitute my data with
arbitrary data when I'm about to sign, but is still limited by 1
signature per manual pin entry)
So to guard this topic: I'm also interested in the
security-considerations of my intentions, but my main question is: what
are the experiences with the mentioned card & cardreader?

@_subject: More secure than smartcard or cryptostick against remote attacks? 
I'm no expert, but isn't that only useful if you have a card-reader with
pin-entry? If you use your compromised PC to enter your PIN, the malware
can just replay that PIN to the card.

@_subject: LiveCD with GPG 2.0.18+ 
Is there any LiveCD that has GPG 2.0.18 (or higher) on it?
I plan to generate some secret keys to store on a smartcard, and to
backup on a USB device. To minimize the risk of Key compromise, I'd like
to do the key generation on an offline machine.
I could do a regular install for this, and wipe the harddrive after I'm
done, but it would save a lot of work if I could boot off a LiveCD.
But since I'd like to move a 4096bit key to a smartcard, I need 2.0.18
(or higher). Are there LiveCDs that have this version on them?

You can use --export-secret-subkeys, that will export the subkeys only,
with a stub for the main key. Importing this file on your online machine
should do what you want.

@_subject: Migrating subkeys 
I've found this guide:
but it doesn't seem to work anymore. I know that migrating subkeys is a
bit of hocus-pocus, but is it still supposed to work? I get stuck at
trying to generate new (correct) binding signatures for the subkeys. I
don't get any errors, but nothing changes after I change the expire date
for the key.
Also, I see an empty Usage: field (where I expected to see "E" to
indicate it's an encryption key).

PS: the reason why I'm trying this is: I'm migrating master key, but if
I keep my current subkeys (signature mostly), I can start signing right
away, and people with my old key (+subkeys) will still see it as a valid
signature. But I'm not very sure that this won't break things when GPG
sees two master keys with the same subkey.

@_subject: Questions about OpenPGP best practices 
I find *.sks-keyservers.net unusable (unfortunately).
More often than not, I get this:
gpgkeys: HTTP fetch error 7: couldn't connect: End of file
tcpdump shows me that the server just closes the connection without an
It does work from time to time, so when doing a manual --recv-key, I
usually get the key within a few tries. But when using e.g. caff (which
does not retry), it's unusable.
So I'm still looking for a good, working keyserver...
And while pgp.mit.edu might not be the best keyserver, it works... (from
my experience at least).

@_subject: Questions about OpenPGP best practices 
OK, I'll take the discussion there.
My definition of "works" usually is "I want to sign a key / verify a sig
and I don't have the key in my keyring. I need to get it". Up until now,
mit's server was "well enough"-synced to provide me with the data I needed.
But I do agree with the points raised, and want to migrate to a "better"
keyserver. However, I don't want to sacrifice reliability (by a huge
factor) in order to do that.

@_subject: OpenPGP card reset procedure 
I'm not sure if this is the right list for this question, but since
Werner is on this list and given his reputation, I'd give it a shot.
I'm trying to understand how the card-reset procedure works on OpenPGP
2.0 cards. No particular need, just because I'm curious.
sending 4 VERIFY-commands with the same (wrong) PINcode.
It next locks the Admin PIN using a similar procedure.
But then:
D[0000]  90 00                                              ..
D[0000]  90 00                                              ..
According to my understanding, this will ACTIVATE FILE, and next
TERMINATE DF.
While the spec seems to indicate the reverse should be done:
TERMINATE DF:
Either way, the procedure (with first ACTIVATE and next TERMINATE) seems
to work, I just don't understand how...

@_subject: [Sks-devel] pool.sks-keyservers.net issues 
Thanks Phil for the very clear summary of the problem!
I'm currently using a downloaded binary from gpgtools.org. I don't see
libcurl in the list of shared objects used by the binary (otool -L,
Mac's equivalent to ldd), so I assume gpg was build without libcurl
support and I need to build a gpg2 myself. Am I correct?
I agree with your sentiment on (1). TCP clearly states that this is the
expected behavior (quote from RFC793 section 3.5):
(2) does require a recompile of the binary. I don't mind compiling from
source, but I think a lot of users won't go further than downloading
(3) will solve thing in the future. Is someone already working on a
patch? Since my options are (a) live with the problem or (b) compile a
fixed version, I can just as well patch and compile the curl-shim-part.
(4) is obviously the best solution from a user perspective, and combined
with my (and Phil's) view on (1), also the "right" solution.

This is a workable workaround for me.
I agree.
(Just for completeness: I don't mind changing behavior from
"standard-compliant" to "real-world working" as long as the latter is
still standard-compliant. Which is the case for this discussion)
I'll keep an eye on the mentioned bug report for progress
