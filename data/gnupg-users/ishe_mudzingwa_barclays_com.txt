Many thanks for. With you suggestion, I was able to compile successfully and
have been able to exchange encrypted files successfully between my Unixware
server and a windows machine.
Thanks and regards

I've seen a similar problem on the Mac when it tries to use the wrong
assembly mpi modules.  Try adding --disable-asm to your ./configure
options before running make.  For good measure, run make clean first,
make clean
./configure --disable-asm
make all
