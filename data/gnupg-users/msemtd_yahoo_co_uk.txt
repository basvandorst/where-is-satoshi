Excellent idea - I shall do the same.

@_subject: Importing my keys fails 
Hi all,
I have a pair of existing keys that I've used for ssh over the past few years and I'd like to use them with gnupg and gpg-enabled mailers etc. but they won't import for some reason: -
michael gpg --import id_dsa
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0
My private key looks like this...
-----BEGIN DSA PRIVATE KEY-----
Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED
DEK-Info: DES-EDE3-CBC,A953971238701254
-----END DSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...and my public key is a single line beginning "ssh-dss ". Neither of them will import so I'm assuming they're either incompatible with my openpgp or I need to cast some magic to get them to work. Here's my version...
michael gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.3

Can they be somehow integrated or will I always need two (or more) sets of keys? Are the keys used by OpenSSH in themselves somehow less secure or is there something in their nature that means they can never be used by OpenPGP? My limited understanding was that symetric keys were just a pair of fancy numbers! :)

Hmm, yes I found a reference to this actually being implemented in  but that may not be a truly Free Software implementation.
Now for the flipside!
Still googling away!
Sorry, I meant asymmetric keys of course :)
