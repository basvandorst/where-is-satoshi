What do I have to do to keep my current gpg authentication if I reformat the hard drive it's installed on and reinstall gpg with a new OS?  I'm not sure where the authentication info is stored or how (or whether) it can be moved.

I think it's too late for that :/
I did copy my home directory though, so I have ~/.gnupg/,
which contains gpg.conf, public.gpg, pubring.gpg, random_seed,
revoke.gpg, secring.gpg, and trustdb.gpg.
