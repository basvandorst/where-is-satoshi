@_subject: Error compiling GPG on AIX 
Please CC me on any replies since I am not subscribed to the list
When I try to compile gpg 1.0. 4 and previous versions I get the
following errors ( I did a ./configure --dusable-asm)
Making all in mpi
        gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I../include    -g -O2 -Wall
-c mpih-div.c

I though the --disable-asm elimited all the assemblerr stuff.
Any help would be appreciated?
