@_subject: Changing the email address of a key 
When I generated my new private key, I used one of my email addresses.
This email address is stored both on the crypto stick (smart card) and
in the secring.gpg or pubring.gpg, probably both.
Now I would like to use that key with another email address. Is it possible to change the email address of a key, and how would I
proceed to have it on the stick and in the gpg stub files?

@_subject: Signing eMails doesn't work anymore 
Hi, this is my first post to this list.
I have a crypto stick from  and when I first
set it up, signing emails worked flawlessly.
But then I wanted to also be able to use my crypto-stick for ssh
As adding the authentication sub key turned out to be difficult, I
generated an entirely new private key with encryption-, signature- and
authentication subkeys generated before putting them onto the crypto
SSH authentication works nicely now, but with the new key, signing
emails always fails. Ecryption and decryption still works. I'm using
evolution, but I also tried with thunderbird. The errormessage I get is
the same I get when trying to sign something with gpg directly. Could it
be that gpg is confused which key to use?

@_subject: Same key on different smart cards 
I want to have a second and third smart card as fallback.
For full disk encryption and ssh it would be ok to have different keys.
But as far as I understand, for eMail signing and decryption, it needs
to be the same key on all cards.
I set up two crypto sticks to contain the same sub keys. But the unique
id of the card seems to be stored in the private key stub
(~/.gnupg/secring.gpg). Thus if I try to use the second card, I get an
error telling me to insert the correct card.
Is it possible to manage the same identity with multiple smart cards? Of course I could use a separate smart card with every computer and have
the stub match the card, but I want to be able to use whatever smart
card I have closest. And in case one breaks, just use the next one.
An what is the best approach for this?

@_subject: Same key on different smart cards 
Ok, let me try to explain my problem/wish a bit more elaborate.
I have a smart card (crypto-stick) where my private sub-keys are stored
for signing emails and debian packages, decrypting emails and
authenticating ssh.
I have multiple computers that are set up to use this smart card for all
these tasks.
My notebook also has full disk encryption set up to use the decryption
key on that smart card to decrypt the luks key in the init ramdrive.
So far so good. But now I'm afraid of what happens if my smart card breaks or I loose
it. So, I prepared another smart card with the exact same sub keys in the
hope to use both smart cards seamlessly interchangeable. As you just told me, I have to delete the stubs and prepare for the
other card. That sounds good enough for the signing, email decryption
and ssh tasks. It's a bit more work intensive for the full disk
encryption part. And it's not really what I had in mind with seamlessly
Now, another solution would be to have different keys on the cards, so I
didn't have to delete the stubs each time I switch the smart card.
This would work well for the full disk encryption and ssh part. But for
the signing and email decryption part, that would now be two different
I hope my intents are a bit clearer now.

I set up ssh authentication a long time ago according to the second half

After the upgrade I had to disable the gnome-keyring-ssh and
gnome-keyring-gpg as well as ssh-agent again, as I did after previous
The configuration for enable-ssh-support in ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf was
still intact.

But on this system, it shows 5 instances 4 with only --daemon and the
fifth with an additional --sh. If I type "gpg-agent --daemon --enable-ssh-support" and execute the
output in a terminal, I get an instance that works and handles the ssh
key authentication.
Is anybody here aware of some changes in this area, and knows how I need
to configure my system, to have it as seamless as before? More

@_subject: Order of keys attempted to decrypt 
I have my private sub keys on a smart card, and up until recently
decrypting was always fine.
Then I found out that for signing other people's keys, I need to have
the primary private key available. So I put it on a second smart card as
described here:
Now decryption still works, but with a small hiccup: $ gpg -d test.txt.gpg gpg: Anonymer Empf?nger; Versuch mit geheimem Schl?ssel 0AE275A9 ?
gpg: sending command `SCD PKDECRYPT' to agent failed: ec=6.91

gpg: Alles klar, wir sind der ungenannte Empf?nger.
gpg: verschl?sselt mit RSA Schl?ssel, ID 00000000
It first tries to decrypt using the primary key. And since the card with
the primary key is not plugged in, it outputs an error, before it tries
the sub key that succeeds.
I tried using the -r option to specify the key to use, but it was
seemingly ignored.
Is there a way to specify which key to try first?
The problem I have at the moment ist that some scripts fail probably
because the error that is output.
For example, it never reaches line 43 of the following script since I
have the stub for the primary key: PS: out of curiosity: What does the "ID 00000000" mean in the output

After gpg-agent stopped to work for ssh auth from OpenPGP smartcard
after some ubuntu upgrade a while back, I launch it and set the env
variables in ~/.bashrc. Since then I have to launch evolution from the terminal to have gnupg
correctly work with it. But even if I launch firefox from the terminal,
it doesn't seem to get the settings for enigform. Where would be a better place for that. The gnupg docs suggest
~/.xsession. But that file didn't exist on my machine,  and since unity is not based on X11 I doubth that it is read at all. In
fact, I just copied the relevant lines from my .bashrc to .xsession and
it didn't work neither for evolution nor for firefox.
Also ~/.profile doesn't seem to be the right place, as it just
calls .bashrc
These are my lines in .bashrc:
# If the agent is not already running, start it
if ! ps aux | grep -q [e]nable-ssh-support; then
    /usr/bin/gpg-agent --daemon --enable-ssh-support --write-env-file
"${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info" > /dev/null
 then read info back
eval $(cat $HOME/.gpg-agent-info) > /dev/null

env vars?

Hi Werner,
So, I replaced my content in .bashrc with yours, but the behavior is
still exactly the same.
* ssh smartcard auth works accross different terminals. (so the agent
must be functional)
* evolution signiging works only if started from the terminal, even if I
comment out the line : "if [ "$PS1" ]; then"
* enigform in firefox doesn't sign the headers.
I did not understand the last paragraph with "gpg-connect-agent /bye".
But since the ssh part is working, I don't think that's necessary.

I didn't read this list for a while, so forgive me if this was

For many years I have used gpg and gpg-agent with ssh support with an

On every ubuntu upgrade I had to fiddle a little bit to have gpg-agent
act for ssh auth. No big deal usually.
But this time, after the usual fiddling, I have it working nicely for

line that is giving me a hard time. This aspect always worked out of
the box so far.

gnupg ?1.4.20-1ubuntu3
gnupg2 2.1.11-6ubuntu2
scdaemon 2.1.11-6ubuntu2

support, and start it again with:

All this was never a problem until now.
Are there any tricks to get the interfacing with smartcards working smoother again?
If I powercycle the smartcard, and kill scdaemon, It will first ask me for the other smart card that contains the master key. If I don't provide this, I could not figure out how to decrypt the file.?
The only way was to plugin in that other smart card, and have gpg find out that this is not the one we need. Then it asks me to plug in the card that I indeed need. Now I can enter the pin, but strangely in the console, and not the pinentry window. With this awkward workflow I am able to decrypt the file.

Hi Bertram,
sorry for the late answer.?
Blockchain was mentioned in some answers, but nothing in concrete.

This was probably discussed here before, but I didn't find it.?
So, feel free to direct me to the old feeds.
I thought about applying for Estonian e-residency for the sole reason
of adding credibility to my GPG key. My idea would be to sign my GPG
key with the ID card. This could give people who are not in my web of
trust a head start.
What Do you think of that?

of course it is better to directly sign the key.
And it is also better if there is a short path in the web of trust.
But my use case is for when there is no path at all in the web of
Most people I know don't even have a GPG key. And of the ones that have
a key, chances are high that they don't have any signatures on it.
So we sometimes resort to keybase.io. There the key is verified by some
social media. Sure, if the social media profile have existed for some
years and have some legitimate looking interactions, it is a good
indicator that its not a face account.
But still, I would trust a government verification more than social
For example I bought a car last week with Bitcoin. The person that
handled the payment for the seller was not present, but gave me his
keybase.io user name on the phone. He signed the email containing the
Bitcoin address for the payments with his GPG key.
He didn't have any signatures on his key.?
In this scenario I'm grateful for every piece of validation to give the
key more credibility.

Every piece adds to the probability of the key being valid.
He is the business partner of the son of the seller. The son was
present and wrote the info down for me.
Usually the prove of identity is done with government issued IDs. So
the estonian e-residency smart card is not so much different in that
Of course it would be better if every country issued something like
that to its citizens. And even better if that was compatible with GPG.
But until that happens we might have to improvise sometimes.
There is also SuisseID somehow similar, but the cost is so high that
nobody is interested.?
