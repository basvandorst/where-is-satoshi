@_subject: Use DINSIG SmartCard 
I'm the "prowed" owner of a DINSIG SmartCard (due to professional reasons),
and I'd like to use it on my Linux Ubuntu 9.10 System with a Cherry ST-2000
USB card-reader. OpenGPG cards are well recognized by gpg and gpg2. In contrast, the
commandline tool gpg says:
fava at desk:~$ gpg --card-status
gpg: detected reader `Cherry SmartTerminal ST-2XXX (000065e9) 00 00'
gpg: pcsc_connect failed: sharing violation (0x8010000b)
gpg: Kartenleser ist nicht vorhanden
gpg: OpenPGP Karte ist nicht vorhanden: Allgemeiner Fehler
With gpg2, its better:
fava at desk:~$ gpg2 --card-status
Application ID ...: FF7F00
gpg: this is a DINSIG compliant card
gpg: not an OpenPGP card
But still, no operation does work:
ava at desk:~$ gpg2 --card-edit
Application ID ...: FF7F00
gpg: this is a DINSIG compliant card
gpg: not an OpenPGP card
Befehl> passwd
gpg: OpenPGP Karte Nr. FF7F00 erkannt
Error changing the PIN: Nicht unterst?tzte Verarbeitungsaufgabe
Is there a way to use the SmartCard?
Thank you for your interest

Hello Werner,
Thank you for your help.
Here is what I got:
fava at desk:~$ gpgsm --learn-card
gpgsm: DBG: connection to agent established
secmem usage: 0/16384 bytes in 0 blocks
fava at desk:~$ gpg-connect-agent
S SERIALNO FF7F00 0
S SERIALNO FF7F00 0
S APPTYPE DINSIG
I could not see any key appear in Kleopatra (Ubuntu 9.10, KDE4) or somewhere
(gpg2 --list-keys)
Does this mean it doesn't work or does this mean that I did not understand

Hello Werner,
In fact, the customer support wrote me that mail:
"We are not sure why this tool is recognizing the card as a DINSIG card, but
we are quite sure the card is not a DINSIG card.
Most likely the card is using a ECH0064 compliant structure..."
Could this be helpfull and is there a solution to use this card with gnupg?
Fabio
