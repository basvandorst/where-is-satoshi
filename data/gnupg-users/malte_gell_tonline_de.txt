The expire date was okay, but the key prefs I made were lost and set=20

I guess it's a bug of gpg-agent, since decrypting without gpg-agent works ?
Besides that gpg-agent runs fine, I use it with the Aegypten software to get PGP/MIME with KMail it really happens only with gpg-agent enabled and trying to decrypt symm. encr. files.

one of the common capabilities of all AES candidates was to offer different key length, e.g. 128,192,256 bit. So one can edit his key in order to make use of AES256 instead of "standard" 128 bit AES.
Why is this not the case with Twofish ? If I look at cipher.h it seems 128 bit Twofish is deprecated and only experimental and the cipher option "Twofish" always refers to 256 bit Twofish, so why is there no Twofish/Twofish192/Twofish256 just as it is the case with Rijndael ?
Are there any special implementation issues regarding Twofish one should be aware of ? I can't imagine that 128 bit Twofish is dropped due to security reasons...

when installing the Aegypten project software to get PGP/MIME support=20
it's recommended to compile gpgme with=20
"cd gpgme  && ./configure --without-gpgsm ..." (according to=20
 ), but doesn't=20
without-gpgsm mean, that S/MIME support is skipped ?
According to  S/MIME is already working, so=20
I'd like to have KMail to support it besides PGP/MIME. So if gpgme is=20
compiled again without the "--without-gpgsm" flag does this mean that=20
S/MIME support will be available ?

Maybe this could be a way to encourage email encryption. Under GNU/Linux=20
many people come in contact with encryption when using e.g. rpm -v=20

A normal Windows user never gets in contact or cares about encryption, I=20
think some education is needed.
Mozilla could be a start, it is so big, it wouldn't make a big=20
difference if GnuPG and enigmail would become part of it. For many=20
Windows users it may be the first time to install an OpenPGP compliant=20
product and to get in contact with email encryption. And if Mozilla=20
would "complain" "Dear, XXX, you have not yet..." I think this would be=20
a big step forward.
How large is Mozilla for both, Linux or a Windows user ? !8,19 or 20=20
MB's ? Now, if GnuPG would be part of it, the additional 1 or 1.5 MB's=20
wouldn't be much addtional "bloat". I'm especially thinking of the=20
Windows users at this point, because under GNU/Linux GnuPG is already a=20
de facto standard and GNU/Linux users are used to use GnuPG. Wouldn't=20
this be a nice approach ?
