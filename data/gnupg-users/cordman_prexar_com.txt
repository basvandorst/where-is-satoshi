I'm trying to get GPG support activated in GPGME. Upon compiling, it tells me that I need gpgsm. Where do I get gpgsm?
I have GPGME downloaded and installed. I see there is a subfolder named gpgsm, but there are no files by that name. Is GPGME looking for a specific file named gpgsm or just that subfolder?
TIA, Cordman
