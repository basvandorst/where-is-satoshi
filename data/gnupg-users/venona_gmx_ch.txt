@_subject: 1.3.1 cross compile error 
I tried to cross-compile GnuPG 1.3.1 on Debian Potato with mingw32/cpd
0.3.1, but the error shown below appeared and compilation failed.
I set no option in configure, so all the options were default.
But when I set the option --with-included-regex the same error appeared.
Below is the error message:

On the other hand, when I set the option --disable-regex, another

May anyone tell me how to avoid the error?
Any suggestion will be appreciated.

@_subject: Lib\idea could not be found error 
Hello Servie,
Firstly,  download the IDEA library from Next, create directory named "lib" in the above HomeDir
and unzip idea.dll to the directory "lib" you created.
Lastly,  write the line "load-extension lib\idea" (without
quotation) in your configuration file gpg.conf.
Do't forget to hit ENTER at the end of the line
mentioned above.
Then gpg.exe will show the message "Cipher: IDEA, ..." when you type the command "gpg --version" in the command prompt.
