Would it be considered a best practice to rotate encryption subkeys on  an annual basis, or would that be considered overkill for most uses?
I realize that messages are encrypted using ephemeral session keys  which in turn are encrypted with public keys. Considering the small  amount of data (i.e. sessions keys) being encrypted using public keys,  are ciphertext attacks really even feasible?

Most likely, your application is not actually running as the "oracle"  user. Try adding a call to "whoami" in your script to make sure it  really is running as "oracle". You might add "env" as well so you have  a good picture of your environment variables.

@_subject: gpg: failed to create temporary file 
Hi Lee,
I'm not that familiar with BPEL, so perhaps you can elaborate on it.  When it starts a shell to execute commands as a user (oracle in this  case), does it always launch the shell specified in the user's /etc/ passwd (/bin/bash) or does it simply start a POSIX shell (/bin/sh). If  BPEL only starts a POSIX shell, then you will not pick up anything  from .bash_profile. Indeed, unless the shell is started as a "login"  shell, you might not even get .profile.
If BPEL avoids starting any sort of shell and simply runs the programs  directly (via fork() and exec()), then you may not even get $HOME  depending on what environment variables BPEL passes in to the exec()  Try running the "env" command from BPEL and review the results. Pay  particular attention to the contents of $SHELL, $HOME, and look to see  if $GNUPGHOME is present and set as expected.

One last test: Rather than having BPEL run "gpg" directly, perhaps you could have it run a shell script that in turn runs "gpg". You should then be able to set whatever variables you need prior to the call of gpg from within the shell script. You can also enable tracing (set -o xtrace) to help with script debugging.

You probably just need to set ultimate trust on your own key. Once you do that, all the keys you've signed should be considered valid.

@_subject: Need help understanding the difference between assigning owner 
The difference between key validity and owner trust is in the object  of the trust.
If you trust the key, in that you have verified that the user ID  contained on the key does indeed belong to its holder, you indicate  your trust in the key by signing the key. Since your key is explicitly  set to ultimate owner trust, you will automatically consider any key  signed by you to be valid.
Owner trust is how you express confidence in the owner of the key to  validate other people's keys. If a key belongs to a person who is  sloppy about signing other keys, you would assign them a low owner  trust (or even none). On the other hand, if you know that someone is  very diligent about vetting keys, you could assign them a high owner  What does this do for you? Mostly, it's a time saver for yourself. If  you receive a 100 keys from various individuals, you could be diligent  in verifying each and every one of them before you sign those keys.  Once you sign a key, it is considered valid.
Otherwise, say 90% of those keys were already signed by someone you  know is diligent about verifying keys. If you assigned that person a  high owner trust, those 90 keys would be automatically considered  valid by you, and you'd only need to verify the remaining 10.
A marginal owner trust is for people that might do a good job of  verifying a key's UID. In which case you would consider valid any key  signed by three such individuals.
There are two types of signatures at this point: local and exportable.  If your signature on the key is local only, then your signature on the  key will not be exported should you choose to export the key to  another location (e.g. a keyserver). If your signature is exportable,  your signature will be appended to the key when you send that key  onward. If other people trust you to validate UID's by assigning a  high owner trust to your key, they will automatically consider valid  any such keys signed by your key.
In the X.509 certificate model, high owner trust is granted by you  implicitly when you hold a certificate authority's root certificate.  Any certificate signed by the chain of CA's that terminate at a  trusted root certificate is automatically trusted (valid).

The file gnupg-2.0.12.tar.bz2 hosted on ftp.gnupg.org appears to be corrupt. The signature is not validating. I've tried downloading the file using both Mac OS and FreeBSD with the same results.
However, when I retrieve the file from the Canadian mirror ftp.gnupg.ca, the signature validates correctly.
The MD5 hash of the file retrieved from ftp.gnupg.org appears as
MD5 (gnupg-2.0.12.tar.bz2) = 4718d8a8cd3eac100951d8b162cf537b

Hi Charly,
Thanks for checking this out. It got me looking a bit closer.
Here's the weird part:  If I download the file using Safari I receive the file correctly.
If I download the file using the command-line "ftp" on either OS X (10.5.7) or FreeBSD (7.2)
the file appears corrupted and is slightly smaller.
BUT, if I issue the "binary" command to the command line ftp
program, the file is retrieved correctly. This is really bizarre because both my local system
and the remote system are both UNIX so binary is supposed to be the default.
If I retrieve the file from the Canadian mirror using the command line, I do not need to
issue the "binary" command for the transfer to be successful.
I can only conclude that something is set up on the primary FTP server (ftp.gnupg.org) that defaults
to ASCII mode.

Hi Jesse,
There is no rule that says you must upload your key to a keyserver. If  you are concerned that others might find your email address, then  simply don't upload your key. If you then want someone to have your  PGP key, you simply exchange it some other way (e.g. email, web page,  memory stick).
Keyservers make it convenient to locate others' keys by searching on  key ID or email addresses.
FWIW, I have had my PGP key in circulating in keyservers since 1997.  Only my yahoo.com address gets buried in spam but that address has  never appeared in my PGP key. Instead, I have used that address for  registering at sites that require email addresses for access to  content, such as New York Times. That address gets hundreds of spams a

Is there a way to have GnuPG automatically retrieve a key for encryption similar to the way the "auto-key-locate" feature works, but when specifying a keyid instead of an email address? For example, if someone has a key id, but not a key, I would like gpg to automatically pull the key from my configured key server.
Background: This is for an automated batch job. Signed keys are updated into our key server. I would like to be able to skip the step where I need to manually load the new key into the batch processor's keyring every time I receive a new key. Recipients are specified using KeyIDs which are stored in a database table based on a customer ID.

Hi Gerry,
When someone is referring to a "key" they are typically referring to a "key pair" -- both public and private. Your primary key and various subkeys are all keypairs.
Public keys are used for encryption and verifying digital signatures.
Private keys are used for decryption, creating digital signatures, and for signing other keys.
A subkey (keypair) that is flagged for encryption will have both public and private components.

One thing you could try is implement a corporate certification-only  key, used for certifying others' keys. You would have a second keypair  used for signing, encryption, and conducting regular business.
Your encryption keypair could expire as normal, but your certifying  key would not. Then you would set up your trust system to only trust  those keys signed by your corporate certification key.
Since your certification key doesn't expire (or at least not as  frequently), you would save yourself the trouble of having to re- certify all your partners' keys.
