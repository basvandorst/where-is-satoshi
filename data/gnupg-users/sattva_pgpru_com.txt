@_subject: Keyservers mangle with subkey binding sigs 
While I understand that this place isn't the best for PKS bug reports,
I'm still not sure of what's happening (except it's quite weird). My key
0x8443620A consists of a main certification key and two subkeys: one for
encryption and one for signing.
Both subkeys have expired in the end of the last year, but I've chosen
not to generate new and to simply extend life of existing subkeys for
another few years, so I've re-signed them with extended expiration date
and updated to keyservers. A few days later one of my correspondents
contacted me saying that my key is expired and unusable. I've looked at
keyservers, and was very surprised that they're not reflecting the
changes made!
Here for example (in the bottom) you may see two subkeys with binding
signatures expired at 2007-12-31:
But if you look at the original copy you'll see that all regenerated
sigs are in place:
sattva at localhost ~ $ cat openpgp.txt | gpg --list-packets
:signature packet: algo 1, keyid FAEB26F78443620A
        version 4, created 1199529401, md5len 0, sigclass 0x18
        digest algo 2, begin of digest 1f 06
        hashed subpkt 26 len 45 (policy:
                hashed subpkt 27 len 1 (key flags: 0C)
  >>>>  hashed subpkt 2 len 4 (sig created 2008-01-05)       <<<<
  >>>>  hashed subpkt 9 len 4 (key expires after 3y11d13h6m) <<<<
        subpkt 16 len 8 (issuer key ID FAEB26F78443620A)
        data: [4095 bits]
If I understand this correctly and not missing something terribly here,
keyservers just looked at newly uploaded key, thought "huh? I already
have that subkey in place, and this 0x18 sig too!", and discarded it
without going into much trouble of analyzing any binding sigs'
timestamps (maybe marking them as duplicates).
Could anyone confirm this behavior?

Many thanks for all input. The problem disappeared in the same way it

everything is fine now, both subkeys have all the most recent 0x18

something badly, however this is quite unlikely...

Chilupuri, Vishwarupachary (Chary) (AU - Sydney) (08.05.2008 12:08):
It wouldn't work that way. You have to split your file into multiple
files and iterate over them with GPG. Or, if this is applicable,
concatenate all webform input data before encryption and store it in a
single DB field (this is how I would implement that: since all data is
already encrypted, is there a reason to store it in many different fields?).

Funaki, Yasuhiro (07.05.2008 10:31):
Such application of hashing algorithm is called String-to-Key (or S2K
for simplicity): it crunches variable-length passphrase into a
fixed-length string used as a decryption key. In order to specify a hash
for S2K operations, use --s2k-digest-algo  (or place it in
gpg.conf): all newly generated keys will use that hash. Now if you want
to change S2K hash algorithm of an existing key, just change passphrase
(even to the same value) of that key.

Kevin Hilton (21.10.2008 21:48):
Extra bits will be discarded from the hash function output.
If the hash output is not enough, then extra 0x00 byte will be added to
your passphrase and hashed again to produce additional and different
hashing output. If even this isn't enough, then two 0x00 bytes will be
added and hashed again, and so on.
Nevertheless, it is s2k-digest-algo, which is used for *all* passphrase
crunching operations.

Just use both processes one after another: first produce two SHA-1

for the key and discard what's left.

I wouldn't consider Stamper's keys as secure. They date back to 1995,
they are a v3 keys, they are even not self-signed so it's not so easy to
even import them on the keyring.
Try using something like this: Using a hash value from a secure hash algorithm will suffice. Keep in
mind that you should timestamp not a hash value alone, but a hash value
along with the name of hashing algorithm, e.g.
What do you mean by stable?

Yes. You could remove passphrase from your private key (do --edit-key
[your_key], then passwd, and finally save). Or you could write your
passphrase in some text file and supply it to gpg with --passphrase-file
parameter. Both options could be just fine or quite dangerous depending
on your security considerations and actual environment, I'll leave that
part alone.

While you keep the private key on the keyring, you may continue to use
it for decryption (and everybody else would be able to use the
corresponding public key for signature verification) even after it has
expired or been revoked. You, however, will not be able to use it for
signing, and others won't be able to encrypt data with the public key.

Yes, they will. What likely happened here is gpg exported public key
(actually, your digital certificate along with the key material) in a
slightly different way than pgp, and radix-64 encoding of the underlying
binary data lead to a differently looking ascii armor. While OpenPGP
implementation is exporting data in OpenPGP-conforming manner, it's no
matter in what sequence it is writing the actual packets.

You're mixing concepts. Trusting someone to vouch for others' keys
validity in *not* the same as believing someone else's key is valid. I
think, what Robert meant (and feel free to correct if I'm off here) is
he wouldn't trust certifications from that "ex-CEO Ben", but there's
nothing wrong really if one or several persons whom Robert trusts
certify "Ben's" key.
In GnuPG, you assign trust levels manually. In turn, GnuPG computes
validity automatically. Trust doesn't gets transferred from one key to
another. Validity does (in a sense).
