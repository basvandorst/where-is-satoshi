You are partly right.
AFAIK the encryption works as follows. A symetric key is generated to enc=
the message. The symetric key is encrypted with each public key of the=20
recipients and included in the message. For decryption you will decrypt t=
symetric key with your secret key and then decrypt the message.
So not the text is encypted twice but the symetric key is encrypted twice=
 (or=20
one time for evry recipient). Otherwise a message would grow very fast.
As others mentioned, the normal behaviour is not to include the senders i=
n the=20
list. But most mail clients do it by default.=20
