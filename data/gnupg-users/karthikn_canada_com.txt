@_subject: Importing secret keys from PGP 
Hello all,
Looking to run gnupg on WindowsNT. Trying to import keys generated by PGP. Imports public key fine and reads but fails to import secret(private) key. Is this a passphrase problem?
Any other thoughts, solutions or workarounds?
Thx a bunch,

Looking to automate the decryption process using gnupg. Can't seem to find any examples of the --batch option.
Any links\documentation would be of immense help.

Thanks Steve.
When gnupg is attempting to read the passphrase from a file descriptor, what file does it look for? I am working on a Windows2000 environment.
