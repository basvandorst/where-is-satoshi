@_subject: what does this mean? 
Could it not also mean that the file was corrupted? Invalid Packet.

It means that the message was encrypted using a public key for which you
do not have the matching private key.

There was a compatibility issue with PGP 5.x AND Gnupg, Anyone have a
reference to this?
5.x cannot decrypt. I forgot where I read this..

I'm setting up a cgi to encrypt files for a specific user. I've given
web server a minimal gnupg installation - it only has the public key
required to encrypt the files. The problem is that gpg insists on asking
"Use this key anyway?". I do not want the web server to have a key pair
its own. Is there any way to tell gpg to use this key without prompting
me? Even setting trust level to 4 hasn't helped.

I am using GnuPG on a Windows platform to automatically encrypt a file which
I am sending out via FTP daily. Unfortunately, I cannot automate this
process fully because the command prompt asks the following before
completing the process of encrypting my file:
It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named
in the user ID.  If you *really* know what you are doing,
you may answer the next question with yes
Is there any way I can avoid this prompt?
