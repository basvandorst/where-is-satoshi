I found the following on the web, which says that the DSS standard is
a bit bad and not very secure - is this true?

Hmmm... let me get this right: The hash is used for digital signatures
and then the generated hash is crypted with the secret key, so if the
text is changed or you use the wrong public key an error occurs. This
way the secret key should not be stronger than the hash.
But what about encrypting the whole text and not signing it? There you
use a conventional symetric cipher to encrypt the text and the
symetric key is crypted with the public key of the receiver. In this
szenario the secret key need not to be stronger than the conventional
Do i understand things right when i assume there are two secret keys,
one for signing and one for encryption and that the first is not
longer than 160 bits but the later may be 1024 bit or more?
This 1024 bits are the size of the prime to generate the 160 bits of
the secret key for signing?

@_subject: Re[4]: Revoked keys on keyservers 
If it's that easy, it's unsafe even without key-servers. What you describe is
a brute-force attack and it's not easy, because there far too many keys to try
(for 1024 Bit a single PC will take some million years to try all possible
keys if i rembemer the numbers correctly).
