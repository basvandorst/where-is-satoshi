You can't.
Thawte Computing ( used to do this as a part of their
Personal Web of Trust Certification System. Allegedly they stopped this
service due to compatibility problems (their software choked on pure,
GPG-generated OpenPGP keys, for instance), but I'll advise checking.

It depends on smartcard users. There are RSA smartcards that you can trigger
to generate a key and give you public part for certification (and you can
send them signed public key back for storage) but they won't surrender you a
private key.

They have stopped certifying PGP but they haven't stopped their Freemail
Certification Service.
There was. He was a Polish guerilla soldier during WWII and was killed on
1.1.1945. This is why I use my middle initial.
They have. To have Thawte Freemail Certificate with your name, you go to a
few (at least two) Thawte Personal Web of Trust Notaries to show them your
ID (and hand them xerocopies of it). They are obliged to testify that you
came in some day and have shown good papers saying who you are. I am Thawte
WOT Notary (my identity was confirmed by Bruce Watermeyer of Thawte, but
anyone can become a Notary).
No it won't. Biometrics data can be stolen. Repeat after me: BIOMETRICS IS
NOT AN UNIVERSAL SOLUTION TO SECURITY PROBLEMS.

David Shaw napisa=B3[a]/wrote/schrieb:
This is an interesting problem in key management. I know that longer primary
key does not make the whole protocol safer at the moment. But I am not
thinking about the very moment. What I want to archieve is to avoid a need
to change the primary key in my lifetime. If I make a primary key long
enogh, the weakest link is the hash, which will grow longer with time. But
if I would make a 'standard' DSS key, and year ago it would show that 1024
bit DSS is breakable with a reasonable budget I would be hosed and forced to
replace the whole key including the primary. But if the subkey will appear
to be vulnerable, no problem. The subkeys are expendable and can be replaced
Am I missing something?

It is always possible to use primary key for signing if necessary. And I am
not afraid of the keyserver problems because I couldn't upload my
current(provious) key anyway - it had subkeys and other stuff keyservers
don't like.
BTW: it is legal/a good thing to put URI of the signing key in the signature
notation? What are notations for anyway?

Lotsa (for example in trust calculation).

In 1.0.7 you need to set trust for your own keys too.
This doesn't look like a GPG error, more like some GNOME frontend. No. No.

Go read Applied Crypto.
DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) can have keys of any length.
DSS (Digital Signature Standard) utilzes DSA and sets keylength to 1024.

@_subject: How secure is GnuPG 
It is perfectly possible. I was also thinking about larger caliber - both
radio and optical TEMPEST for interception.
There's always SOME way to defeat crypto-user. The only thing that I can't
directly tell ways of defeating (except of stealing it) is trusted hardware
crypto token that actually can display the data it works on so the user is
sure what he is signing/decrypting. In short - use GPG on a notebook.

Ultimate trust is for keys you have secret key for. Yes, it is you who you
trust ultimately.
Or you may want to create a elgamal subkey so you don't have separate keys.
using --default-key directive?
By looking in user ids on keys.
You will have to switch to using key IDs.
RFC2440 seems appropriate.

This is a Bad Thing to do this such a way. It is the most unintuitive

those cryptic codes which really aren't documented anywhere I know of. Nor
is the method of getting these. Any chance that we'll get consistient user

While I think it is a good idea to have such kind of medium, using IRC on
single server is not that good idea. or using IRC at all.
What I suggest is to use SILC ( It is similar to IRC in
general feel and appearance, it has support in Irssi IRC client, but the
network is designed to be more robust - and is protected by cryptography.
Everything is encrypted and users are distinguished by their key ids.
The authors of SILC promise to include support of OpenPGP keys in future.
If anyone thinks its a good idea, please join the 'official' SILC network,
channel G10 (note the missing leading '
