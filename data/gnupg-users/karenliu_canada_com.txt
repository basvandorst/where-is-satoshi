@_subject: NAI PGP 6.02 + gpg 0.9.10 interoperability? 
I'm currently using PGP 6.0.2 with gpg 0.9.9, and so far it works fine for
encrypting files and decrypting files.
I used gpg to encrypt file with a PGP 6.0.2 key, and use PGP 6.0.2 to
decrypt the file, and so far there hasn't been any problem.
I haven't used PGP to encrypt with a gpg key though, as the instruction
seems quite complicated.
