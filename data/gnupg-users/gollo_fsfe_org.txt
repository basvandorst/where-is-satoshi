* Todd A. Jacobs  [110417 17:14,   mID ]:
The auto-key-retrieve options is for signatures made on content, not on
keys. AFAIK there is no option for automatically retrieving all keys
that signed a key.

Dear Richard,
* Richard  [110830 20:30,   mID ]:
I think this is a good decision.
AFAIR, 3072 bit keys have to be generated on the card. If you use
off-card generation, you are limited to 2048 bits.
Both is possible. IMHO the best way is to use subkeys. If you want to
sign a key, you can use the backup of your main key as long as you
follow the howto at [1] which I happen to be a co-author of.
This should not be a problem if you follow the howto mentioned. You can
use a copy of your backup and transfer the keys to the second card. It
is however important to have the "right" secret keyring on the PC you
are using the card with as the ID of the card which has the subkeys is
being stored. I hope this is helpful for you, but if you have any questions, don't
hesitate to ask :-)
[1] All the best, Martin

I had this problem back in 2009. This sounds like a good reason for what I experienced. If I find the
time, I'll try it out and maybe switch to bigger subkeys.

Maybe one should think about *why* this is the case. Nevertheless, your

This is true, but K9 at least does display the messages correctly.

considered better than inline PGP.

* Doug Barton  [110227 05:30]:
Encrypted messages differ from signed messages. The percentage of
inline-signed messages I receive with bad signatures is much higher than
the number of PGP/MIME messages with broken signatures.
Despite that, there are MUAs which do not automatically parse every
message completely to see if there's inline PGP content in them, but if
the see that a message uses PGP/MIME they immediately try to
decrypt/verify the message.

* Grant Olson  [110227 04:11]:
Same here, but I always take the card with me if I leave the room.
Yes, this might be an issue. What I do is that I run my gpg-agent in a
loop and the agent is killed every 10 minutes or so, also causing
scdaemon to exit. This works pretty well. And, of course, you should
force the card to ask for the PIN for every single signature (this can
be set on the card itseld).
My multitasking capabilities are not good enough for parallely working
on my PC and always watching my card reader at the same time ;-)

I sign *all* my e-mail except for messages sent from my mobile (in that
case, my signature tells the receiver why the message is not signed and
offers the receiver to request a signed proof of authenticity later) or
messages to people who can't receive signed messages (I had a case where
e-mails arrived empty because of the MS Exchange/Antivirus/whatever
combination at the receivers working place).
Less than strange text fragments at the head and the bottom of a message
(Some people even think they are being spammed when they see inline PGP
data), because an attachment without useful data will rather be ignored.

* jimbob palmer  [110111 12:05]:
A digital signature is useful so the sender can check if that message
was really sent by you. If it's only encrypted, there is no proof for
that since everyone who knows the recipient's public key can encrypt
messages for this particular person.

Hi all,
Has anyone experienced problems with the most recent version of
pcsc-lite (1.6.6) when using an OpenPGP smartcard with GnuPG? My card
reader, a Cherry ST-2000U stopped working after I updated my Gentoo
system recently (while my SCR335 still works). I tried to do some
debugging and scdaemon reports an unknown PC/SC error code. This is all
I could find out. I also tried to disable the internal CCID driver, but
this didn't change anything. I still receive different error messages
(like "no card found" although the card is inserted).
Any hints what I could do?
Thanks, Martin

This depends very much on the people you communicate with. People in the
Free Software are tend to do it "right" because when they start to use
e-mail regularly with others in this area, they are usually being asked
to use "proper" style :) I started with Free Software in the 21st
century and still learned to not use full quotes and top posting. The
first time I realized that proper e-mail style is useful was when I
started to read more mailinglists with rather high message volumes ? you
just can keep a better overview with "correct" quoting :)
p.s. Even some of my non-techie friends realized the advantage of this
     style after a short explanation ;) The real problem is actually MS
     Outlook and its default settings.

You forgot gpg --send-keys (newguyskey) and the fact that signatures on
a key are actually ment as a statement that the signer has checked the

If you follow the steps of the howto at [1] without using a smartcard
(i.e. you don't move the subkeys to a OpenPGP card, but keep them in the
keyring), this should work without problems. You can then sign and
decrypt files with the subkeys (if you do it right, people will encrypt
messages to the correct subkey *only*).

My first guess: The Gemalto reader is actually not listed in that udev

so I can check? There is also a script [1] that does the udev stuff
automatically. I always try to integrate new readers into the script if
someone tells me the USB device ID :-)
Also, you might want to try out the Card howto [2] which is probably the
most up-to-date one around.

@_subject: Sending signed e-mail via shell script 
I'm currently trying to do a smal script that sends automated e-mail
messages on a regular basis. I want to sign those e-mails and since mutt
does not allow to use it's OpenPGP features in non-interactive mode, I
try to at least have these messages signed using inline PGP.
For this, I use the following commands on a Debian squeeze machine:
cat $file | gpg --no-verbose --batch --quiet --output - --passphrase "" --armor --textmode --clearsign > $tmpfile
mail -s "" $address < $tmpfile
The problem is that I get a "BAD SIGNATURE from ?" when verifying the
signature in mutt. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the problem has to
do with the encoding. I'm not very talented in shell scripting, so any
help is highly appreciated. Of course if you know a way to send
automated PGP/MIME signed messages, that would be even better.
Thanks, Martin
