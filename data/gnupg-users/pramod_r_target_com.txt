@_subject: Question regarding the migration of the pgp keyring to gpg 
We are migrating from pgp 6.5.8 to gpg 1.4.11. I  had a question regarding the migration of the public keys and the private keys:
Is there a way where I could migrate the entire key ring at one go? I'm currently extracting my keys from pgp using the pgp -dx  command and then importing each of these into the gpg. Is there one single command which would help me migrate the entire key ring at once?
Warm Regards,
Pramod R

Yes.  PGP 6.5.8 keyring files are directly importable into GnuPG.  Just find your pubring.pkr and secring.skr files and do:
  gpg --import /path/to/pubring.pkr
  gpg --import /path/to/secring.skr
That will import all of the keys at once.

@_subject: Problem with the pgp to gpg key migration 
I tried migrating the public and the private key from the pgp(6.5.8) keyring to the gpg(1.4.11) by following the below commands:
1)      Tried exporting the private and the public key from pgp using the commands:
pgp -kx " " pubkey.pgp
                                pgp -kx " " sec.pgp ~/.pgp/secring.skr
2)      Tried importing these two keys into the gpg using the below commands:
gpg --import pubkey.pgp
gpg --allow-secret-key-import --allow-non-selfsigned-uid -import sec.pgp
3)      When I tried comparing the pgp keyring with the newly created gpg keyring (using the commands: gpg --list-key), I found that all the keys have been migrated except two of my self-generated pgp keys.
4)      When I also tried encrypting a plain text using pgp using my self-created pgp and then decrypting this using the gpg (after migrating the keyring as explained above), I got an error saying that gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available, which obviously because I cannot see my own keys in the new gpg keyring.
Please let me know if I'm missing anything here. Also do let me know if the above problem makes any sense or if you would need any other information.

Hi David,
Thanks so much for your response on this.
Now, when I tried decrypting a pgp encrypted file through a gpg (using the gpg --decrypt command), I'm running into this problem of "idea encryption (0) failed" even when I tried compiling one of the idea.c that I downloaded, using the command: gcc -Wall -O2 -shared -fPIC -DBIG_ENDIAN_HOST -o idea idea.c
I came across one of your posts in the below link where you mentioned that you edited the idea.c for the "endianness" and got it working:
Could you please let send me the latest version of the idea.c that has taken care of this problem?
Thanks so much in advance as this would mean so much for me..
Let me know if you need any clarity on my question...
Warm Regards,
Pramod R?
