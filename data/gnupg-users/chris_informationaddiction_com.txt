@_subject: invalid armor header and PGP 8 
Hi All,
This maybe a newbie question but I've searched the faq and mailing
list and I can't find an answer...
When trying to decrypt a PGP 8 message I get the follow error from GPG
gpg: invalid armor header: The header looks like this:
-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
Version: PGP 8.0.3 - not licensed for commercial use:
When I manually remove the  the message decrypts fine.
My question is, is there an easy way to automate removal of that line?
Or fix this problem? Many of my encrypted e-mail comes from PGP 8
Thanks for you help in advance!
