Werner, my general understanding of mailing lists is that one is
free to discuss anything that has to do with the topic of that
list, at this point it seems only fair to point out that even
the RedHat mailing lists allow and it's members help solve
problems that rise even on Windows, and I can understand why,
since most of them have the technical know-how and experience.
I really don't understand why one would bash something that
makes GPG popular with Windows users. It's not open source, ok,
so what ?

Since it decrypts PGP messages just fine, I do believe it is.
