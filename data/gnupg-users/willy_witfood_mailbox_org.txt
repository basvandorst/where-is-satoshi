@_subject: Yubikey NEO OpenPGP advisory 
whether this is a big or minor issue really depends on the use case.
In my opinion the perfect use case for the yubikey NEOs OpenPGP is to
respond quickly to confidential but not extremely sensitive email in all
environments which includes mobile phones. Here it's still significantly
better to use one with the vulnerability then the most common
alternatives: storing the key on the phone or using plaintext email.
Ideally I would like to have one identity with multiple subkeys which
also communicate multiple use cases, say
1) confidential: subkey on a yubikey NEO
2) secret: subkey on a smart-card with an independent card-reader with a
3) top secret: offline key
Then the sender could select the right one for the message.
