In addition, as explained by Barth et al. in 2006 in
 "When GPG generates an ElGamal public key, it does so in the group
of integers modulo a random prime. Thus, different principals are
very likely to have public keys in different groups, making GPG
encryptions vulnerable to passive key privacy attacks. [...]
GPG could defend against these attacks by using the same prime for
every public key, for example one standardized by NIST"
What is the state of this recommendation?  Has it been implemented?
I'm not a crypto expert but I also think the following:
Encryption is performed symmetrically using a randomly generated
session key K, that is encrypted to the public keys of all (hidden)
recipients.  Thus, if a message M is encrypted to you and other
recipients using RSA, then you are of course able to obtain the
session key K.  Now, if you suspect Alice to be a recipient then you download her public key from a key server and encrypt the session
key K under her public key.  If the result matches one of the
encrypted session keys contained in M, then Alice is a recipient of
If I'm not mistaken this attack works with RSA but not with ElGamal
(as ElGamal does randomized encryption).

@_subject: how vulnerable is "hidden-encrypt-to" 
I'm not sure whether I understand you correctly.  If I'm not
mistaken then you are referring to sender anonymity.
In contrast, I interpreted the original question in terms of
recipient anonymity: Bob wants to encrypt a message to some
undisclosed list of recipients (say, including Alice and Eve), and
nobody should be able to figure out who (else) is on the list.
Clearly, the fact whether I can decrypt the message tells me whether
I'm on the list or not; however, I should not be able to learn more
than that.  In particular, I should not be able to identify any
other recipient.
In that situation, my previous posting was meant to suggest that Eve
(if she has access to the public RSA key of Alice used by Bob) will
be able to figure out that the message was also encrypted to Alice.
Thus, hidden-encrypt-to, throw-key-id, and hidden-recipient do not
help here.  I'd be happy to be corrected if I'm missing something,
Best wishes

That's correct, but severely restricted.
I'm not convinced.  First, I don't want to enable lots of
unnecessary parties to read those messages.  Second, I may be
interested in real protection, not just in having fun with false
Also, "different" would need to be random and of sufficient
I'm not concerned whether the average user can do this right now or
not.  I'm concerned about experts (that could also provide attack
tools to average users).
Many thanks for your input!

@_subject: A safe text editor // why?? 
I neither see this as an editor issue nor a GnuPG one.  Instead, I'm
using full disk encryption.  Then I neither have to worry when a
device/disk gets stolen nor when it breaks and needs to be disposed.

@_subject: gpgsm and dirmngr 
Dear reader,
I?m experimenting with gpgsm and dirmngr.  Please redirect me to a
more appropriate mailing list, if it exists.
Does dirmngr only speak LDAPv2?  If I configure a LDAPv3 server, it
complains about the ?historical protocol? upon bind from dirmngr.
This appears to indicate use of v2 by dirmngr.
The README (2013-04-26) of dirmngr 1.1.0 states: ?Note that GnuPG
includes an updated Dirmngr starting with GnuPG 2.1.?  The latest
version of GnuPG 2.1 seems to be gnupg-2.1.0beta3 dating back to
20-Dec-2011.  What happened to the GnuPG 2.1 branch?  What is the
most recent version of dirmngr?

Hi there,
gpgsm has the option encrypt-to, which is not mentioned in the man
page.  Is that option stable or might it disappear in the future?

@_subject: gpgsm and trusted keys 
Hi there,
after I imported my private key into gpgsm, it was not trusted for
signatures by gpgsm, because the root CA was not trusted.
After enabling allow-mark-trusted in gpg-agent.conf, gpg-agent asks
whether I trust the root CA.  Saying "yes" creates
~/.gnupg/trustlist.txt with the root certificate's fingerprint, and
the key becomes usable.
However, I actually don't trust them, so I don't want their
fingerprint in trustlist.txt.  Instead, I do trust the intermediate
CA, which signed my certificate request.  Manually adding their
fingerprint to trustlist.txt did not work, though.  I was still
asked for trust in the root CA, and saying "No" resulted in a failed
Is there a way to mark intermediate CAs as trusted so that all
certificates issued by them become usable?

Hi Uwe,
if I understand you correctly, you fail to encrypt to your From
address, right?
If I?m not mistaken, epa does not encrypt to From addresses by
default.  What did you do to make that happen?
Does your gpgsm.conf contain ?encrypt-to? for the expired

As a workaround I retrieve certificates with ldapsearch (LDAPv3 over
SSL/TLS) and import them into gpgsm afterwards.
Apparently my timing was bad ;)

You can uninstall or update gnupg :-)
Alternatively, for EasyPG you can customize epg-gpg-program.  (The
configuration code tries gpg first, gpg2 second.  So uninstall
should really help.)

P.S. Do you know Mail-Followup-To (MFT)?
If you customized message-subscribed-addresses, my reply would
automatically get the correct recipient headers, see:

I don?t know about that.
MFT has benefits: If I reply to a message with MFT, the To header is
automatically directed to the list (instead of the From e-mail address).
A small joy ;)
Moreover, with MFT I know whether you would like to receive a separate
copy for replies or not.

No.  Actually, I don?t know anything about the Crypto Stick but I?m
using an OpenPGP smartcard.  I don?t need pcscd at all.  In fact, on
one of my machines pcscd was installed and interfered with scdaemon.

My advice: Uninstall pcscd and re-try.
