@_subject: Listing the signatures of a certain UserID 
I am using GPG as basis for a certification script. The
signing I actually do with
 gpg --yes --edit keyID number_of_uid sign save
What I would like to do is to list all the signatures for
a certain userid (before signing it). I can use
 gpg --edit keyID number_of_uid check
but this lists just the signatures, for which keys are
present in the keyring (the keyring on the certification
host will usually not contain more than the key to be
signed and the key of the certification authority).
Or I can do
 gpg --list-sigs keyID
and then use a quite complex matching algorithm like
- read until a line starting with "uid" or "pub" occurs
- get all the following lines beginning with sig, stop
  on the first thing other than sig (is this correct?
  or do I have to stop at the first occurence of another
  "uid" entry?)
This way I would have to remeber which signatures were
following which UID (and I would run into troubles if
some key had two or more uids with the same text (but
with different signatures).
Yes, I know, this is a little bit theoretic, but anyways,
I would like to get a listing of all signature belonging
to one uid (using the number that is displayed by --edit-key
as a reference).
Any ideas or solutions?
Thanx a lot...

maybe your requests are filtered by a firewall?
Usually you need to enable access to port 11371
on the keyserver...
Maybe this helps? Cheers,

@_subject: elGamal Keys to Sign+Encrypt 
Hi all,
I just tried to generate an elGamal-only key (for
signing and encryption). I noticed, that obviously
the elGamal-only keys are deprecated in GPG version
1.2.1 and you can only generate them in the expert-
mode. Some issues (security flaws, ...) with these
We are thinking about which keys we want to sign
with our certification authority, so are there any
arguments against elGamal (besides that nearly
no application can handle them)?
Cheers... Olaf

@_subject: Automatic Signing via Script 
Hi all,
I am writing some scripts for a certification authority.
These scripts are presenting the information of the keys to
be signed to the person who is signing them, ask if
everything is alright, and then just sign the key without
further user-interaction.
What I do is: Call "gpg --edit-key" with the necessary
commands following (so something like gpg --edit-key 1 sign save
would choose the first uid and sign it).
This works. But: It does not work when signing keys that
have an expiry date set, because gpg then asks:
This key is due to expire on YYYY-MM-DD.
Do you want your signature to expire at the same time? (Y/n)
How can I skip this question? I already use "--yes" but it does
not work in this case. If I use "--batch" gpg exits in this
case. Any suggestions?
Cheers... Olaf
