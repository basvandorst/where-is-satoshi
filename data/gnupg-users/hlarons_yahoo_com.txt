@_subject: [ANN] mygpg-0.4: A perl/Curses interface for executing gpg commands 
This perl script runs in a text console or xterm. It
uses a Curses interface in Q-and-A style to construct
a gpg command line for common operations. There is no
need to remember the syntax of gpg commands or
It may be downloaded at:
The script was developed under perl, v5.8.1 built for
i586-linux, and gpg (GnuPG) v1.4.1
Perhaps most readers of this list may not need this
simple kind of front end for gpg, but it can be useful
for more casual users. Your comments or bug reports
are welcome.
