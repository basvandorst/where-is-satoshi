@_subject: Should we trust "MyMail-crypt for Gmail" Chrome extension? 
I'm wondering whether this open-source Chrome-extension for GPG on GMail[1]
is to be trusted; I mean, not to call home with my secret-key and passphrase.
I searched through the mailing-list archives and found only one
reference from 2014:
This extension is the only alternative to use GPG with gmail in
corporate environments where SMTP ports are blocked (unless we
consider as an "alternative" to manually clear-signing each message
text to be sent with cmd-line).
With kind regards,
  Kostis

Has anybody managed to compile pyme3 on Windows?
Thanks for all the Hard Work,

These are `pyme-0.8.1` win32-bindings for python-2.
The latest bindings have been ported to python-3 and renamed to `pyme3`,
currently in version `1.7.1`,[1]  and are now part of `libgpgme` project.[2]
I need them compiled for python 3.5 & 3.6 (due to differences in MSVCR
- The easiest would be to be compatible with GPGvWin.[3]
- The optimal would be to include them in Gohlke's "Python Unofficial
binaries" [4],
  or upload them as a 32bit-wheel in PyPi.
So far I downloaded from GnuPG-downloads [5] and managed to compile
`Libgpg-error` and `Libassuan` dev-libraries using MinGW cross-compiler in
But I do not know what to do next (or if this is the right path)?
Any more help appreciated, but thank you Jerry anyway,

Ideally python bindings should be compiled and packaged as wheels
for  3 different "platforms":
- MinGW
- Cygwin (when GnuPG there upgrades from the old 1.x)
- Gpg4Win (32bit & 64bit, don't know what are they using.
Do these 3 make sense?
Are there more combinations?

Maybe that's an opportunity to put to use "notations
, and self-sign the keybase-uidusing --cert-notation.
Of course, nobody would care to check that,
but would there be any other issue down this road?
Kind Regards,

Thank you for your efforts.
Would it be possible with the next release to build also the python-2
& 3 bindings for Windows?

@_subject: PGP for official documents / eIDAS and ZertES 
IANAL, but I would agree with Reiner that the implementing acts are not
More detailed, from the three standards supported, only the last one,
XML-sig, supports PGP: Regarding organizational issues, there in nothing in eIDAS *in principal"
that forbids a company to use XML-sig with PGP.
But it would be interesting how the "national authorities" would react
in practice,
should they receive such a request from a company.
If it would work, for certain, these 2 German companies would have a head-start.
Check also the "closed systems" exception in the eIDAS regulation.
Search the legal-text for this term (e.g. Art 2.2) to get a rough
understanding of this.
Finally, I believe that a crucial point is whether the interpretation
of "assurance levels"
can also apply to PGP, and Art 16 hints that it does.
This may be the twisting-arm power for PGP to come on board eIDAS.
Thanks for bringing this subject up,
  Kostis

But it doesn't have to be XML!
Besides ETSI, the european organization implementing eIDAS has 3 "standards"
(e.g. [1]):
XADES(XML), PADES (pdf), CADES - the last one doubting if it has any modern use.
Why not push them for a new PGPADES standard?

The are very few references of "Linux" in the FAQ btw.

Maybe start using "Gnu Variants"[1], because that is technically precise.
For instance, this name includes also `cygwin`, which requires the
typical configure-make-install procedure?
Those compiling GnuPG for other platform may clarify the situation.
