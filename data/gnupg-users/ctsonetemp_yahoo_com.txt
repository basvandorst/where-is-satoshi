@_subject: Importing a PGP public key with no expiry date to GPG 1..4.2, 
When I import a PGP public key that has "NO expiry" date, into GPG 1.4.2, it shows the key as expired & the PGP created date shows as 'expired date' .
Is this a bug? or is there a way to force GPG to not set the expiry date from the created date??
When I try to encrypt with the PGP public key (ignoring the date), it gives the following error?
gpg: 6988865C: skipped: unusable public key
gpg: install.txt: encryption failed: unusable public key
When I try to sign the pgp public key, it gives the below error
Command> sign
gpg: no default secret key: malformed user id
Any suggestions. There is NO issue with the PGP public key & it is used currently. GPG is setting the PGP created date as expired date.?

Thanks Werner?
This is for a client who is using gpg 142 and I am trying to simulate that here. we are providing them the pgp keys.?
attched the conf file.?
here is the list of commands run?
C:\gpg>set GNUPGHOME=home
C:\GPG>gpg --list-keys
pub ? 1024D/7017503A 2013-11-29
uid ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?aa sub ? 2048g/41B425C7 2013-11-29
pub ? 1024R/6988865C 2010-10-26 [expired: 2010-10-26] ?( This is incorrect. the PGP key does not have an expiry set )
uid ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?nadm at xxxx.com
