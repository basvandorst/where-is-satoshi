@_subject: Deleting keys 
I am a newbie, and have made a very big mistake.
I generated a key with a bad password, and a smaller key space than I
wished.  I generated a new key with a far superior password and keyspace,
however, I am unable to delete my old keys.  I have not sent any emails or
encrypted any data with any key as of yet.  I am using GPG 1.0.4 on Redhat
6.1, 2.2.12-20smp.
I invoke 'gpg --edit-key redmist', and get the 'Command>' prompt.  Secret key is available.
pub  1024D/2CE3B90A  created: 2001-02-21 expires: never      trust: -/u
(1)  redmist Command> I issue the command 'key 1', and it returns, "Command> key 1 No secondary
key with index 1".  I have tried 'toggle'ing the keys, 'delkey', 'delkey
redmist', and every combination of commands and UIDs that you can think of.  This is what my key listing looks like:
pub  1024D/2CE3B90A 2001-02-21 redmist pub  1024D/86E07DD5 2001-02-27 redmist sub  4096g/22605735 2001-02-27
I want to keep the key from the 27th.
Thank in advance,
Dave

@_subject: perl script to clearsign documents automatically 
If I understand correctly, you can use the Expect module off of CPAN.
What this module does is it automates the interaction of a user and a
program.  It can get tricky as your interaction complexity goes up.

@_subject: Wierd signing and encryption output 
When I sign or encrypt a message, with myself or anyone else as the
recipient, I dont get a normal output.  I get very strange characters that
cannot be decrypted or verified.
I cannot copy and paste the output into this email (pine over telnet), so
I have posted it at  GPG does not
prompt me for my password when I attempt to encrypt an email.  I am using
GPG 1.0.4 on Red Hat, kernel 2.2.12-20smp.  These are the commands as I
issue them:
[redmist gpg]$ gpg -r redmist -e plain.txt
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
File `plain.txt.gpg' exists. Overwrite (y/N)? y
gpg: this cipher algorithm is depreciated; please use a more standard one!
[redmist gpg]$ gpg -r redmist --sign plain.txt
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "redmist "
1024-bit DSA key, ID 86E07DD5, created 2001-02-27
File `plain.txt.gpg' exists. Overwrite (y/N)? y
Thanks in advance,
