Why is that a US-centered view?  I am in the US and agree that it is
ugly, I just don't see exactly why it would be limited to here.  I
just don't like the way it works with some of my email programs.

I guess I was referring more to using a pgp-mime message.  The standard
pgp block messages can be copied and pasted.  Trying to check a signature
that was attached to the message could be difficult as well.  Another
reason I would have preferred that people would sign a text file and
then attach the text file and signature rather than signing the text
with some of the headers.
