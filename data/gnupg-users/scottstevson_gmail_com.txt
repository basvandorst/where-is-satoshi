@_subject: FTP down? 
Hey all,
I'm new to the site so please excuse me if I'm not using the appropriate
list.  I'm trying to install libgcrypt but my connection to the FTP server
times out when I brew install or try to hit the download location from the
GnuPG home page.  Does anyone know if the server is down?
