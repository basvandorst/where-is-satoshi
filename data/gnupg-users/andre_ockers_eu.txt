@_subject: Generating revocation certificate 
Dear all,
After I've created a new key and uploaded it to a key server, I ran into
something when generating a revocation certificate.
In Seahorse, I could select the right (new) key and make a revocation
certificate from there.
But when I tried to do the some thing in Bash I ran into the following:
$ gpg -a --output andre at ockers.eu.asc.revoke --gen-revoke andre at ockers.eu
sec? 4096R/F5FE3668 2014-07-31 Andr? Ockers Which is the fingerprint of the old key.
What happened and what can I do?
Thank you very much.
Best regards,
Andr? Ockers

Dear GnuPG users,
I went to the FOSDEM keysigning party [1] and now I'm in trouble.
The situation is:
- GNU/Linux Trisquel + Icedove (= Thunderbird rebranded) + Enigmail here
at home;
- 171 official keysigning party participants, of who 107 showed up to my
- 5 participants have a key on the keyserver in a for Enigmail
downloadable state;
- when I want to check [2] a fingerprint of a downloaded Key ID I get an
error message, for example
$ gpg --fingerprint <599C62A291810408>
bash: syntax error near unexpected symbol 'newline'
Please help! Thank you very much,
Best regards,

Removed Postfix.
Installed Nullmailer.
So what do you do here if you have an emailadress, like
andre at ockers.eu
at an email service provider, let's say
Would that be ockers.eu or serviceprovider.nl in /etc/mailname?
Would that be ockers.eu or serviceprovider.nl in
Would that be
mail.serviceprovider.nl smtp --port=587 --starttls
--user=andre-nullmailer --pass=...
mail.ockers.eu smtp --port=587 --starttls --user=andre-nullmailer --pass=...
in /etc/nullmailer/remotes?
Thank you in advance,
