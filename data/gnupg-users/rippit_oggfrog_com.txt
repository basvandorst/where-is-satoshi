@_subject: Which Key ID for Business Card? 
Greetings, I just subscribed.
I'm getting ready to have business cards printed, and want to include my Key ID on them so that recipients can look up my key from the keyservers.
My old business card had the Key ID F7605786, UID crawford at goingware.com   This is a 1024-bit key that I generated with the old Open Source PGP way back when.
But I have some hazy memory of generating a 2048-bit DSA key at some point, which I think is the key one should use when sending me mail these days.
Given the following:
$ gpg --fingerprint rippit at oggfrog.com
pub   1024D/F7605786 1999-01-11
   Key fingerprint = 9B9F 2D03 9996 AF83 9A4F  CB26 20E8 0D0B F760 5786
uid                  Michael David Crawford (aka Rippit the Ogg Frog)
uid                  Michael David Crawford
uid                  Michael D. Crawford sub   2048g/1EA551E9 1999-01-11
Which is the Key ID to print on my business card? F7605786 or 1EA551E9?
Or should I generate a new key entirely?
Following is my latest key.
I just used gpg --edit-key adduid to add the first two UIDs, which seems to have rendered my key untrustworthy.  Once I'm completely happy with my key I'll get some friends to sign it again.

Were you using Firefox?  It has what I regard as a mis-feature, in which it preloads at least the top hit of any Google search results.  That way the page will load quicker if you do click its link.
Your virus is one reason it's a mis-feature.  Consider also how much trouble you could find yourself in, should that top hit be an FBI pedophile honeypot.
Possibly there is a way to disable the mis-feature, but I don't know what it is.
If you weren't using Firefox, possibly other browsers have the mis-feature now as well.
