The RSAREF library has a key length limit of 1024 bits, that key is larger
and cannot be processed by the library. (AFIAK at least)

I would very much like it if 'gpg -a --clearsign' could sign more than one
file at once - could someone add this to the todo list?

@_subject: Disable trust db? 
I would like to use gnupg as a simple keyring lister, but for some reason
it wants to insert every key it sees into the trust db - this is reeally
slow, but I can't figure out how to turn it off?
Any hints?
Also, could the import command be given an optional key file to import the
key to? That would make keyring maintinance a bit simpler I think.

Oohh, this is exactly what I want in the first place! This doesn't seem to
be mentioned in the man page though. It is also limited to a single file
and it gives strange output:
--keyring  --fingerprint pub:q:1024:1:CE951B1160D74C7D:1999-05-01::553:-:Patrick Cole :
gpg uid:::::::::Patrick Cole :
I need the key fingerprint and I don't know what rtv is for..
Does it disable any functions? dry-run seems like a bad name to me in that
case, maybe 'read only mode' or something would be better?
-n does work, but it creates the secring and trustdb, but does not enter
anything into them:
samosa{jgg}~/keys --dry-run --no-options --batch --load-extension rsa
--keyring ./debian-keyring.pgp --keyring ./debian-keyring.gpg

The precise set of options I use for generating encrypted messages that
PGP2 will read is:
gpg --no-options --batch --load-extension rsa --no-default-keyring
--keyring [foo] --output - --quiet --always-trust --armor -r 0x[to
keyfingerprint] --rfc1991 --load-extension idea --cipher-algo
idea --encrypt foo.txt > output
It is critical that you ecrypt a file given on the command line not using
a pipe. GPG uses a different packet format that PGP 2.x will not read.
The reason the above disables the option files and such is that it is part
of a more complex script, I suggest using it as a starting point and then
going on to putting it in config files.

I have tried it, you saw my output below - it works fine.
GPG (aka PGP5) keys CAN NOT ever be used with PGP 2.x. Your key must be a
PGP 2.x key before it will work.

Sort of, maybe. It depends on what operation you are intedending to do. PGP2.x cannot handle OpenPGP (aka GPG, PGP5, etc) keys at all. If you are
using such a key then you cannot sign or recieve encrypted messages from
PGP 2.x users.
I'm just going to guess that the problem you had in your last mail with
the exact gpg incantation I gave was simply that you specified an OpenPGP
key with the -r option.
For the most commonly used case of signing, yes. For encryption GPG will
be able to use the other parties PGP2.x key.
The change from PGP2.x key formats to OpenPGP key formats is not backwards
compatible, any keys generated in the OpenPGP format are not supported by
PGP 2.x. OpenPGP keys are generally superioir and in some respects more
secure than PGP2.x keys.
I hope not, PGP2.x should be killed off as quickly as possible. All new
keys should be generated in an OpenPGP format. If you -must- do this then
you can use PGP2.x for the key generation step.

AFAIK it was to get new features and fix some of the complaints with the
old key format. I know the old PGP 2.x packet format was also somewhat
limited and was improved as well.
There is that, there is also the fixes made to deter forging fingerprints
and probably other things I don't know about.
I'm just happy that GPG can interoperate with PGP2.x as much as it can -
it could be worse.
