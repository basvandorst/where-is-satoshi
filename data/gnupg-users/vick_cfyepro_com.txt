I am working on setting up gnupg on a RedHat Linux V 7 web server. The goal
is to send encrypted emails via PHP. After many hours of pulling my hair out
I have it mostly working. I have one remaining problem. When I open up the
encrypted messages there is a warning from gpg saying something about
insecure memory. Does anyone out there understand what this warning is
