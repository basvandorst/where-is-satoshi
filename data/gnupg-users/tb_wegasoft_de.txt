@_subject: Which *.mo file is which language? 
I want to create a Win32 installer for Gnupg with Inno Setup and need
the information which of the mo file is which language.
I searched the gnupg web site and Google quite a while but I could find
no information on this topic.

@_subject: How to send passphrase to gpg with symetric encryption? 
I tried the following method suggested by one of the list members:
  echo "1234" | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 -c test.txt
It *seems* to encrypt without error (well, at least it does *not* ask
for the passphrase) but when I try to decrypt the
message again with this command:
  gpg -d test.gpg
I get the error message "decryption failed: bad key"
I tried it from the commandline and in a batch file.
Any hints what I may be doing wrong?
BTW, running on Windoze 2000 (which may be the cause ;-)

Sorry, I received a very weird bounce for my first message so I
thought I made some mistake.
Unfortunately thinking this *was* a mistake ;-)

Hi Timo,
:symkey enc packet: version 4, cipher 3, s2k 3, hash 2
        salt 007b15fc1dd96a6f, count 96
after entring the passphrase gpg displays this:
:encrypted data packet:
   length: 51

Hi Timo,
I use the following batch and I hope I was successful in typing
"1234" when gpg asked me ;-)
 OFF
del test.gpg
ECHO 1234 | gpg -c -v -v --cipher-algo BLOWFISH --passphrase-fd 0 test.txt
gpg -d -v -v test.gpg
This is the output when I run this batch:
Reading passphrase from file descriptor 0
gpg: loaded digest 2
gpg: writing to `test.gpg'
Drücken Sie eine beliebige Taste . . .
:symkey enc packet: version 4, cipher 4, s2k 3, hash 2
        salt 30ebf29dd06f4b8b, count 96
gpg: loaded digest 2
:encrypted data packet:
        length: 51
gpg: BLOWFISH encrypted data
gpg: decryption failed: bad key
The exact version I'm using is 1.0.6-2

Hi ,
Most likely you are right.
I tried various possible things and found the following to be working:
I put the passphrase into pass.txt and changed the batch to the
TYPE pass.txt | gpg -c --passphrase-fd 0 test.txt
I'm aware that this is not a very secure solution but I'm only
experimenting at the moment because I'm not sure how to pass the
passphrase to gpg from a program that is used in a web application.
