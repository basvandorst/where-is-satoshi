thx :)
Why are you installing 2.0.30 from source?  GnuPG 2 is already available in
the package repositories.
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get upgrade
    $ sudo apt-get install gnupg2
Current Ubuntu stable, Yakkety Yak, ships with 2.1.15, I think, so it's even
considerably newer than 2.0.30.
