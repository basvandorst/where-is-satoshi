@_subject: storing password lists in mails to myself on IMAP? 
I use thunderbird on my laptop and desktop with an IMAP server, and
I've been mailing myself encrypted mails with website passwords so I
have access to them on both computers.
This is just as secure as encrypting a file and copying it onto both
computers without using e-mail as a medium, right?
Or am I doing something stupid?

You're doing something "strange" anyway. The encryption is just as
strong either way, but any email client is liable to create temp
files and stuff which could hold unencrypted copies of your password
lists. Given that this is an IMAP account it's possible those temp
files exist on the IMAP server. :-(

Amusing as it is to me anyway, Firefox will do this. Part of it's
crash recovery is saving a copy of messages you're composing every
few keystrokes. I'm not even sure you can turn the feature off, and
if you have a "everything but the kitchen sink on the server" setup
those temporary copies are stored in a draft folder *on the IMAP
server*, unencrypted.
I know for a fact it can happen because I've seen it first hand
on my own Courier/Postfix server in bold, living color.
Yeah. Sure it does.
Maybe you should think things through, or God forbid even run a
few tests or something before puffing your chest there Robert.
Especially when you're in the unenviable position of potentialy
being your own proof of concept.

Well Robert, unless you care to further debase yourself by trying to
argue the Thunderbird isn't a "commonly-used IMAP client" you've
been handed the very example you're harping  about. By two different
people no less.
It was in the part you snipped and ignored, in case you were wondering.
The bottom line is this: There's probably a lot of IMAP clients out
there that will by default or design write portions or whole copies
of unencrypted text to a server. It really doesn't take a boat load
of IQ points to realize this is the nature of IMAP.
Storing pass phrases in email at all is bad idea for a number of
reasons. You don't have many clues what a client does with it when it's
open for one. The odds you'll inadvertantly click where you shouldn't
and send an unencrypted copy some place you don't want it to go
increase dramatically too. Likewise the chances of corruption or
compromise at the hands of some script kiddie.
If we invested a little thought in the project though we could
probably come up with a few dozen reasons why mailing passwords about
is a bad idea even if you have absolute control over the hardware at
the end points of the encryption, let ALONE any scenario where you
can't guarantee they won't be written to hardware you don't own. In the
clear. :-(

@_subject: US banks that can send PGP/MIME e-mail 
There is a security element to this, but it actually works the other
way around.  SSL is considerably *less* secure than an openPGP
message.  Here's why:
  * CAs: SSL requires you to trust a certificate authority (and to
    date CAs have already been exploited).    * MitM: There are also a number of MitM techniques that work on
    HTTPS connections.  One attack that comes to mind involves
    establishing a non-SSL connection to the customer.  They get no
    pop-up about a bad cert because there's no cert involved.  The
    attacker even uses an icon of a padlock for the site, so if the
    customer is careful enough to look for the padlock, but not
    careful enough to look where the browser puts it, they will be
    fooled.  Alternatively, an attacker can simply use an untrusted
    cert knowing that many people will just click through their
    browsers popup warning anyway because they cannot be bothered.
  * Phishing: There are many tricks that bait customers into logging
    into a rogue site that masquerades as their banks, ultimately
    creating a compromising interaction would be avoided if the
    statement were properly delivered.
  * storage: When a customer downloads their PDF statement over https,
    the PDF is unencrypted and it remains in that state, vulnerable to
    anyone who penetrates their home pc.  Securing the storage
    requires additional effort on the part of the customer (generally
    unlikely).  OTOH, if PGP is used, the statement is encrypted in
    storage by default.  A customer would have to proactively decrypt
    the attachment with intent to archive it in the clear in order to
    achieve the same vulnerability as the status quo.
You would not need any such release of liability.  All natural people
banking in the US are free of liability per regulation E.  (I say
"natural" people, because businesses do not get reg. E protection).
Although banks bear the liability for poor security choices, they
generally do not care.  They just need a facade that complies with the
poor standards and comforts the relatively street-unwise shareholders.
IOW, they only need to *appear* secure, they don't actually care to
*be* secure.  Hence why they don't bother with PGP.
If banks had a genuine interest in security, they would at a bare
minimum be PGP clear-signing their e-mail notices to customers.  It
would impose no technical changes on their customers, but customers
keen to detect phishing could do so, and the bank could then honestly
say that they've taken an effective step toward mitigating phishing
attacks.  Dumb user tools could then be created that makes it possible
for everyone to detect phishing attacks, not just those who are keen.
Requiring a periodic human interaction is obviously less convenient
for the human.  And as I pointed out, it simultaneously less secure.

The installation problem takes care of the other.  Hushmail users need
not know any more than yahoo users when opening an account.  A HM user
may not even be aware that PGP is in play, or what PGP is.
It's been fixed.  Check out countermail.com, or hushmail.com.

I'm not sure why you put so much stock into the MBA.  An MBA merely
makes someone into a good bullshitter, so their idea, however flawed,
is better marketed to upper management.  In the end, the result is
better marketing spin, not better ideas.  And worse, better ideas end
up losing out to better marketed ideas.  When one MBA is pitted
against another, the decision makers ignore it anyway, and vote with
their gut and use whatever data supports the decision they've already
made -- not the other way around.  It's a sham.
It's really not a good time to attempt to prop these guys up, when
every economy in the world is suffering acutely from their colossal
and aggregate incompetence.
Do you need a business study to prove that a helicopter costs more to
maintain than a bicycle?  The contrast is so sharp, one would be a
fool to even consider funding such a study.
I won't waste any time trying to track down the proof that you're
asking for.  But I will say that ssh and textual interfaces are
decades more mature than javascript, Adobe Flash, Flash cookies, and
all the other dodgy shit you find on bank sites (and casino sites
alike).  And the difference in complexity is staggering -- complexity
being directly proportional to defects, which in turn are directly
proportional to security vulnerabilites.  Moreover, an SSH server wouldn't drag the bank into the vicious
pattern of chasing the shiny.. e.g. there would not be a need to work
on improving the smoothness of animations that must glide accross the
screen.  New web frills are emerging on a rapid and ongoing basis - highly
unstable.  This means the cost of securing it is an ongoing cost.
This recurring cost is needed just to keep up with the new bugs that
are being introduced -- a cost that comes on top of the normal cost of
intrusion detection and incident response.
I know studies have already proven the relationship between complexity
and bugs - although I don't recall where the research was done, it's
not just my imagination.  And the relationship between bugs and
vulnerabilities is security 101.

@_subject: gpg for anonymous users - Alternative to the web of trust? 
There is a related issue.  Assume you are a tor user.  Go to
irc.oftc.net, channel   This is where tor users hang out.
There you will find some person on there called "arma."  This is one of
the main authors for Tor.  But is he?  Are you really on some MITM attack IRC server with all fake
bots?  Is someone else pretending to be him?  He does appear to be
logged on via an mit.edu ip...
You can't know.  All you can find out if the same person signing the
code releases is in possession of the same secret key as the person on
the IRC.  You can ask him to sign some snippit of text to verify he is
in possession of the secret key used to sign the tor source code.  That
is it.  Is that Roger Dingledine? Who knows.  But from a user's perspective I don't know if I care.  In this case,
that person signing code = person I am talking to is probably enough
for me to get support for the product.  (Assuming I am using the same
Tor everyone else is).
Although moneysphere is supposed to protect you from people creating
new certs for your site, what if your signed cert is stolen and your
dns changed?  Using a smart card, it is probably easier to feel assured
your secret key is secure, rather a cert on a server.  So with monkey
sphere you are signing these server certificates, getting one more
layer of protection, that site=key=code.
As to whether you are some covert agent, you probably are and don't
know it.

Plausible deniability is still something to shoot for, because in the
