Might also be worth asking yourself why you feel you need to sign git
commits. Also, if the people you are asking to sign with a GPG key are
not savvy enough or interested enough to choose good passwords (I
assume you mean good passphrases?) then you might have problems that
GPG won't solve.

You may need something like the python3-qrencode package.
