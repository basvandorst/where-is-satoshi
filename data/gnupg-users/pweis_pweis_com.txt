@_subject: Calculated trust and ownertrust of signatures 
I should have been more clear on that. I am talking about the trust
value of the people that signed a certain key. Let's say I want to
know how much I can trust A's key. Suppose A's key has two signatures
from people I trust marginally. All I get from GnuPG is a calculated
trust value for A's key, but I'd like some more information here. I
looking for someting like "B, C and D signed A's key, and B and D are
trusted marginally."
I could do this by looking up every person that signed the key, but
maybe there is a more elegant way. Or maybe I should just write a
small tool to do this.
