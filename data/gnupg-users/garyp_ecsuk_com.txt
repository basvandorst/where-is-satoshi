@_subject: Key usage / Number of keys 
Hi,
  I've generated a key pair at home which i use to enc and sign
messages. I keep my trustdb, and seckey ring on write protected floppy
disk, to prevent any other user modifying the contents. Mainly on floppy
to reduce the time its actually available for copying on the computer. I
know there are ways around this, but it makes it a little harder for
people to get access to my secring.
  The question is, i want to sign / enc emails sent from work, should i
generate a new key pair for use just at work, allowing a seperate ID
that would contain my works email as opposed to my home email. Or should
i simply use the home key that i have on floppy disk?
  Problem with the first is now having two keys / trust dbs etc to
maintain, but this does mean i can use a different passphrase, meaning
if the passphrase was captured it would only comprimise my work and not
home keys. (and vice-versa). This is even more true, by the fact that
the works computer will be shared with other users, I have a lot more
control over how and who uses my home computer (aside from really
paranoid ideas of people breaking in to my home computer, which i'm not
worried about, my information isn't that important ;-)
  Problem with the second is the user id will be my home email address
and not my works email, which some people may find strange.
  Does anyone else do something similar to this? Do you have two keys?
or have you found another way around this?
  Cheers,

@_subject: FD usage 
Is it possible to use file descriptors with the windows version of
  I'm trying to decrypt data without needing to show the msdos window
for entry of the passphrase, instead i'd like to pass this in seperatly.
Also is it possible to decrypt data without having to specify a file to
read from, for example could i pass it in on the stdin etc?

@_subject: FD usage 
One further question on this, --status-fd=2   why is this 2? what does
the 2 represent? also --passphrase-fd=0, what does the 0 represent? I
assume they represent stdio, but which is in and which out?
  Is the usage of 'fd' documented anywhere?   I'm a little unsure of which values i should be passing in for the
--status-fd etc to allow me to read the status from stdio?
  Will using FD allow me to recognise the need to enter a password, and
then use stdin to write the password to gpg? if so how do i configure
this with the command line options? is this what the --passphrase-fd=0
command is for?
  In case this makes any difference to the usage of --status-fd I'm
using it from within code much like winPT does, after creating pipes for
  Cheers,

@_subject: Key Validity/Trust problems 
Hi,
  I've created a program that will be used to encrypt orders using a
specific key from the  pubring.gpg. The program decides which key is to
be used based on what the user is doing at  the time, eg what
information they are browsing.
  This pubring is updated with new keys as and when i create them, but
only if they have  been signed by my master signing key.   This works fine, I can distribute the pubring and program with no
problem and update it.  However the problem comes when i want to encrypt
to one of the pub keys since their is no valid trust path back to a
fully trusted key. This is because the key used to sign all the pubkeys
(my secret key) cannot be distributed with the program for obvious
  Since the user does not know encryption will be taking place, or at
leasts need to be as unaware as possible, i cannot ask the user to
create their own key, and then sign the public keys.
  So I'm left with two possible solutions. Create a dummy secret key
that I also sign all new keys with. This dummy key will be distributed
with the program, thus causing a valid trust path back to a fully
trusted key. Would this open any security holes though? The key would
only be used for varifying trust paths, so i presume it would be only
subject to local attacks? Also since the users would never need to sign
or decrypt using this key, i could make a very very very long and
difficult passphrase to protect the secret key (although i don't think
the dummy key really needs protecting)
  The other option would be to modify my program, so that when gpg says
key trust path cannot be found, are you sure you want to encypt to this
key, It validates the key fingerprint and they uses the key?   Both of these options are only suseptable to local attacks as far as I
can see, and since their are easier attacks on the local machine such as
replacing gpg.exe , i'm not worried about those. Out of the two options
which would be better?    I hope i've explained that ok?
  I understand that really users should each have a secret key that they
sign trusted keys with, to make a full trust path (that is how i use
gpg), however I hope you can see why i'm trying to find another solution
for the purposes of my program, since i know all the keys are to be
trusted as i have created them (if they are signed by my secret key that
is).
