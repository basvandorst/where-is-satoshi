@_subject: Encryption keys: RSA vs. ElGamal 
I need to create a subordinate key, which will be used for encryption only. I tried to find out how RSA differ from ElGamal by searching on the web, but I did not find much useful information. There are some pages that explain the algorithms in detail, but I'm not smart enough to evaluate their security and efficiency just by looking at the algorithms.
So it would be great if someone could tell me how they differ when it comes to security and efficiency. I know that "A disadvantage of the ElGamal system is that the encrypted message becomes very big, about twice the size of the original message", and that both seem to be limited to use no larger than 4096-bit keys, but that's all I know. Please don't give me "they're both secure enough" or "just use the defaults" type of answers, I want detailed information.
Are there any patent issues with ElGamal? The Wikipedia article mentions nothing about a patent. I found this: "Although the inventor, Taher Elgamal, did not apply for a patent on his invention, the owners of the Diffie-Hellman patent (US patent 4,200,770) felt this system was covered by their patent".
I know that RSA was published in 1977, and the patent on it ran out in 2000. ElGamal is from 1984, so if there's a patent on it, will it expire/has it expired in 2007?
