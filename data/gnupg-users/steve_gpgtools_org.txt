@_subject: PGP/MIME use (was Re: META) 
That was the idea behind the question I posed about Enigmail inline default setting. I understand the replies but it's similar to iOS-devices and flash support. Only since adobe got some pressure from the market, flash is under development and has become a little more effective (and also superfluous, since HTML5 is working just fine).
Sometimes if the right parties decide to no longer support an old standard the software that does not support the new (better) standard will die or get improved but I'm not sure I wanna wait for Microsoft to properly program their mail-client. They obviously have enough money to through at that problem but decide not to.
You at least know that the person with that key is the author. That is some information. Should I still stop signing list mails? So far, I used to do that, because I though people then could check and if my key is signed by someone they know it's a lot of important information, right?
all the best, steve

Hey all,
not meaning to spark up new discussions about this issue (we've had that before). But I really think, the energy invested in this discussion would be better invested in writing mailman tweaks.
Also, someone mentioned, that there already in fact *is* a mailman patch for PGP/MIME to work properly? Do I recall that memory correctly? I'm stunned that this issue keeps coming up.
 says Mailman 2.1.15 has been released on 13-June-2012. Is the patch in question included in that release?
Imo, things should rather move forward than stagnate and arguing that a mailing list software breaks PGP/MIME is fine. But as a consequence arguing for a non documented standard (OpenPGP Inline) is strange. I'd rather argue, that mailman needs a fix.
Let's not start a war over this. But could someone please elaborate why mailman after such a long time still breaks PGP/MIME?
All the best and kind regards,

Oh dear. I found it. The bug has been reported 2003: I wish I had better coding skills, but I don't. Sorry I can't code the fix...

@_subject: Testing GPG EMail encryption 
Hi all,
I absolutely agree. At GPGTools we thought about an automatic testing system. Checking if the mail was encrypted and / or signed and then sending out the according reply.
As with so many things and I assume Werner and the Enigmail people know the problem, we never managed to get it done. I'm not sure if one system to rule them all is ideal. Since if a user of GPGTools sendss an unencrypted but signed mail we'd direct him at the according knowledge base article. If we'd use one mail address for GPTools / Enigmail / terminal users, it might be hard to provide the correct information to help users. So it might not be automatable thus create more work.
Currently we encourage the user to send a test mail and do all this manually.
All the best,

I think we had the PGP/MIME vs inline discussion already.  Would that qualify for a second entry in your FAQ with the pro/cons listed? I really would love to see some distilled output. The discussions on this list are very valuable and having the pro / con arguments in some sort of wiki / faq (maybe editable by the users) would imo bring benefit to users, trying to understand backgrounds.
 let us know once you get the basic setup done. Would GitHub maybe be sufficient as a wiki? I am sure there are other nice solutions around, too.

Hey David et all,
first: GPGTools Installer does indeed contain Enigmail and allows installation. Not sure if it has the latest version since Mozilla's crazy versioning means lots of maintenance and we couldn't find a way to automate including new Enigmail versions. Also not sure if it is smart to include it in the future. We'd have to find some smart mechanism to deal with updates.
David, which list are you referring to? GPGTools mailing list? If so, I'm not so sure what you write is correct. Can't recall anybody ever was told to shove off. We had the Inline vs. GPG/MIME discussion in the GPGTools Project and have made a decision for PGP/MIME since we believe that it is the future and is a documented standard. If mailing-list software has issues it is at the devs of that software to step up and continue development of their software. The fact that Werner even wrote a patch which seems to have been ignored is even more frustrating.
If Enigmail encounters problems with mails encrypted with GPGTools, we'll be happy to work things out with Patrick from the Enigmail team. And I know that the GPGTools project was in direct contact with him. So I don't really see the drama. Let's try to be constructive and solve problems. Not cause some where there aren't any.
And as always: feel free to write a patch. :)

@_subject: mailto with pgp fingerprint 
Wouldn?t it be a nice solution, if key server software had a mechanism for users to verify their UserID by sending a mail to the mail address in question.
Those verified keys then could be prioritized over the not verified keys when a search is done. Could still be faked, but would make faking a lot harder.
I assume this has already been discussed on some key server devel list? But have not followed that discussion, so I?m not aware.
All the best,
