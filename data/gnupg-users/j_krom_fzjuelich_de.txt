@_subject: Order of namestrings changed when importing keys 
Hash: SHA1
Hello GPG world,
I'm experimenting with GPG, after using several versions of PGP over the years.  I installed GPG 1.0.6 on a linux box and imported my keyring into GPG.
Several of the keys I imported had more than one user name string (typically different email addresses, but also other info).  For some reason GPG displays for most of these keys another string as
the primary key name than PGP used to do.
Is there a reason for this?
Did I do something wrong?
Can I change this?
Is it a FAQ?  (I couldn't find it in the FAQ files and other docs, but perhaps I overlooked it, searched for the wrong keyword, or so)
Thanks in advance.
P.S. Please answer (also) by CC'ing me; I'm not a member of this mail list.
Met Vriendelijke Groeten,
Jon Krom
