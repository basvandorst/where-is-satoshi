While attempting to sign an RPM package I created using the command:
rpm --addsign _packagename_
I got an error message saying the pass phrase is invalid.
I deleted the contents of the ~/.gnupg directory, which should have completely deleted the key.  I generated a new key using the command:
gpg --gen-key
and entered "123" as the passphrase.
No effect.  I still get an error message that tells me the pass phrase is wrong.  I know I'm typing "123" correctly, so what else could be set incorrectly that would give me this error message?
~/.rpmmacros is as follows:
%_signature gpg
%_gpg_path /home/joseph/.gnupg
%_gpg_name Joseph D. Wagner (For Use with Fedora Core 3) Joseph D. Wagner
