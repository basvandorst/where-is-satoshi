I KNOW this defies ALL GPG/encryption logic, but just TRUST me a minute,
it's OK.  I'm using WINDOWS 9X/XP: I need to get GPG working from a network drive in
order to wire together a "poor-man's secure FTP server"  (Again, I know I
could BUILD one using Linux etc, but hey, I Ain't calling the shots on this
one, I just do what they tell me, until *they* screw up then tell me to find
another job.) It works pretty well from my desktop, but I have GPG installed and
configured on my machine.  I stick in a DOS.BAT the line "..\GPG --options ..\gpg.conf -er vendor.com
venfile1".  I'm in the directory that venfile1 is and gpg and all associated
keyrings and config.files are installed one directory above it.  The gpg.conf file looks like this: comment "test only"   armor                 pgp6                  yes                   OTHER people's desktop.  (No, those who make decisions WON'T allow me to
install GPG on every system that needs it.  Secretly, they're afraid we're
all hackers and will use it to launch some sneak attack on them.  Also, they
don't understand the GNU licensing and are afraid the GNU company lawyer
will send them a nasty letter.  With only ONE copy on the network, they can
all point the finger at me when the Gnu lawyer arrives.  Maybe I should ask
for a raise, since I'm sticking my neck 'so far out' for the company.)
Anyway, if anyone has any ideas how I can slap this into working, I'd be
greatly appreciative. Scott Gates

@_subject: Infere key frm plaintext and exncrypted version? 
GPG & PGP are resistant to a 'plaintext' attack because the TEXT is
encrypted with a randomized session key, unique to that message. So, if =
session key is compromised, it'll never be used again anyway. This =
makes it
*similar* to the only mathematically proven encryption scheme, the =
pad". Also, if the attacker has both plaintext and encrypted text at =
time, discovering the session key is kind of a useless mathematical
excersize--and you have OTHER problems with security, anyway. =20
The SESSION key is encrypted with the recipient's public key  To find =
secret key from that, the attacker would have to be able to factor the
product of two REALLY large primes. Unless new factoring algorithms are
devised, it would be faster and more cost efficient to go find the =
sender or
intended recipient and beat the info out of him. (This is a possibility
covered in Phil Zimmermann's book about PGP.  As I recall, he claimed =
couldn't protect the information from being beaten out of the sender or
receiver. I suppose EVERY algorithm has its shortcomings.)
Hash: SHA1
you probably heard this question before on this list, but please allow =
me to
ask again:
If someone manages to get his hands on the plain as well as
the encrypted version of the same text, does this enable him
to infere the encryption key?
And if so, does this refer to the session key only, or will
it compromise the whole PGP key?
Thanks for your expertise,

Well, I found a 'reach around' for my homedir problem. When I was fully
qualifying the path, the command was too long for GPG to interpret.
I moved a copy of GPG, .conf file, and the public keys to the directory
above where the files are to be encrypted.  We're trying to kick off GPG after FTP'ing to the server using the SITE EXEC
command in our FTP Client.  The Command as of now looks like :
SITE EXEC ..\gpg --homedir ..\ --options ..\gpg.conf -er dory book1.xls
After this, I kick off another batch that forwards the encrypted file to
dory's ftp site.  I know it's a kludge, but, it's a kludge that fits the

Point on the 'security' taken.  However, SDA's have their uses; they are
sometimes simpler than attempting to get the receiver to install GPG or PGP.
I have to send a couple of business related files to vendors.  All of this
is coordinated over the phone.  If the info is insecurely transmitted it's
my  BIG JAIL TIME), but if the vendor's machine is trashed, it's the
vendor's problem.  See my point?   I can talk someone through opening a SDA and I encourage them to Virus
Check.  Since convincing them to install GPG or purchase PGP-Corporate (I
use both) isn't going to happen, SDA's are all I have left.  WINZIP 9.0 is supposedly going to support 256 & 128-bit AES encryption .
I'm not entirely sure how secure these are under a vigorous attack, but,
they're probably strong enough to count as a 'good faith effort' and keep my
 out of jail.  Hash: SHA1
GnuPG does not support this, and likely will never support this.  SDAs
are wildly, tragically, insecure.  Think about it: someone is sending
you a *program* and saying "please run this for me!"

Because you can't make a vendor install a piece of software, free, licensed,
unlicensed, etc .  They just won't do it. Also, most of the people I'm
dealing with are not in the least technically inclined.   Spreadsheets is programmin' to them.  (I cringe when I think about someone
asking me to "program an excel file" for them. --- I'm gonna need lots of
therapy---just look at my eye twitch.)  You know the ones who take classes
to be 'certified' to send and receive e-mail, then proudly hang the
certificates of completion next to their college diploma.   (TWITCH
TWITCH--- It's getting worse).  So, SDA's have saved my bacon on more than one occasion.  I have recently
started using GPG because it lets me call it remotely from an FTP script on
the local host.  This way I can use JCL (batch to you DOS types) and run my
file transfers from the master scheduler. This is fine when the recipient
can receive encrypted e-mail attachments, or FTP.  But the few that need
LOTS of hand holding to open an e-mail attachment are the ones who give me
the most headaches, and are also the ones who won't install software. Hash: SHA1
I'm curious why installing GnuPG isn't a viable option.  (I assume
this is a Windows platform).  I certainly understand the resistance to
install a new program under Windows, but given the use you are talking
about (regular symmetric encryption of a file) GnuPG doesn't need to
be "installed" to be used.  Just unzip the archive and you can run the
'gpg' program.  No installation necessary, and to "uninstall" just
throw the program in the trash.
If you really wanted to, you could even send your receiver a zip file
containing the "gpg" binary, plus the encrypted file, and a batch file
that contained something like "gpg theencryptedfile.gpg".  Poof:
instant SDA.  Of course, it's still insecure ;)

At that point, I really don't care.  My job is to get them data in a timely

get them that data without allowing anyone else to read it.  If someone else
reads it*, I lose my job AND go to jail.  (THAT'S MUCH WORSE.) I have neither the time, nor the political pull** to FORCE the vendors
receiving the data to use any certain encryption software.  So, if I have to
sneak the necessary software in through an SDA, that's fine with me.  I
neither lose my job, nor go to jail for it.   *assuming the Federal auditors find out.

Must be nice to have the power to tell vendors to take a hike.  Most have
been cooperative.  That's good.  But a few (Usually companies owned by

if we lose a few geeks a week to the federal penitentiary, it's not their
problem. (HIPAA's not THAT bad yet, but, it is growing teeth SOON)
Unfortunately, the administration that COULD tell the vendors what to do,

I think it was hospitality which is notoriously full of Luddites. The vendors (airlines mostly) that I work with also like to generate separate keys for each partner. I suspect that they just don't grok what a public key really is. At my company we mandate either (1) SSH2 or (2) OpenPGP. If they don't play, we tell them to take a hike regardless of the "sensitivity" of the information.
Once an interface has been put into place, it's all too easy for marketing people to add more and more information until you've crossed the line into violating the EU Privacy Directive and/or the US Safe Harbor policy. It the interface is already secure, the marketing people can have their way with it.
I feel your pain regarding the EOLN conversion. It seems like the vendors who are using Windows are the least helpful. They always expect us Unix people to do their EOLN conversion.

That's par for the course. The algorithm adds a certain amount of random data, because you're REALLY
just encrypting the session key which encrypted the data. Compression
happens before the encryption, if I'm remembering right; so if you turn off
compression, I'd be willing to bet the size would vary even more.  I
wouldn't guess it would be TOO much, say +- 5%.

If I pick a reasonable sized file (>1mb say) and run something like:

I get 50 encrypted copies of the file, but they are not all the same size.
This leads me to three questions :)
1) Is this because of the internal compression?
2) If so, can I guarantee the same filesize if I switch off internal
3) If so, can I pipe the file through gzip _and then_ gpg with no
compression can I guarantee the same filesize?
