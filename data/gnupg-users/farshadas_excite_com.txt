@_subject: GPGME 
Thanks Ingo for directing me to GPGME.
 Unfortunately, I'm lost in the documentation of GPGME!!! In PGP SDK there are a couple of manuals that explain the APIs and provide some examples. What about GPGME? I did notice doc and tests folders but I cannot figure them out!
 - Where is the manual for GPGME APIs?
 - What about some simple examples? (e.g. for encrypting/signing a file and decrypting/verification?
      thanks a lot,

@_subject: gpgme sample 
GPGME examples in GPGME tests folder do not have any kind of readmes or comments on the code! (or maybe I code not find them).
 Anyway, I wonder if anybody has some simple examples for using gpgme (for example a program that takes a file and en/de-crypts it).
       thanks,

@_subject: Anyone having problems with RedHat up2date and gpg 1.2.0? 
Do you mean that even your GPG is not working anymore?
 I encountered a similar problem too. Then as far as I remember, I did something similar to this (on RedHat 7.3 and GPG 1.0.7):
 I removed up2date package and another package, that I do not remember its name!, and installed GPG 1.2 by using force option upon rpm install. Now my GPG 1.2 works fine, although I have not tried installing back up2date package yet!
