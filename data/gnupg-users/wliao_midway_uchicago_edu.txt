I'm using gpg on netbsd...
  $ gpg --version
  gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.0

  Supported algorithms:
  Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH
  Pubkey: ELG-E, DSA, ELG
  Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160
When I try to import a public key from someone using pgpi, I get..
$ show | gpg --import
gpg: key 39B9671D: unsupported public key algorithm
gpg: key 39B9671D: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
...and gpg --list-key doesn't show a new key.
I'm guesing the ``unsupported public key'' part is just that.
But what about the ``no valid user IDs'' part? Do I need to tell
the sender to to sign themself?

@_subject: Problem with compilation on OSF1 V4.0 alpha 
I had a similar problem on a netbsd 1.4.1 i386 machine. I think
bsd's make was used, not gnu's make...
I ``solved'' this by "./configure --disable-asm" from a fresh
set of sources.

@_subject: binary compat. of files? 
What type of file format is the pubring.gpg, etc? Can I copy
them from machine to machine (i386 -> sparc, etc) and expect
them to work?

@_subject: adduid and new pub keys 
If I add a new user id for myself, the public key from an
--export self is changed as well. Fine.
If a message is encrypted with the old public key, will I be
able to decode it properly? Do I need to generate a new
revocation certificate everytime I change/add email addresses?
