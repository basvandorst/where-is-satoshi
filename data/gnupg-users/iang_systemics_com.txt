I voted for that.  What you have to do is follow
the above link, and then half way down the page
is a link "Vote for this bug" above the big
Additional Comments box.
Then, you have to create an account, which takes
a few minutes because they mail out the password.
And then you can go back to the above page and
vote, by clicking on the checkbox to the right,
clicking on "Change Votes."  Not all really
intiutive, but once you get the hang of it, it
works well !
What would be even better is if there was a bug
to change the handling of self-signed certificates
to promote their use!  Once browsers start to
promote self-signed certs, we might actually see
some more crypto being used.
