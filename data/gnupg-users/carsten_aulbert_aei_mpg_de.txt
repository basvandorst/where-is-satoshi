@_subject: How to sign a remote repository, i.e. forward agent 
Hi all (please cc me on any reply),
this question has come up here in the past but I've never found *any* reply so My problem is relatively simple. We provide a (Debian) repository for our colleagues as well as ourselves and would like to sign it (for the experts: reprepro's export option). Of course one could either copy around the secret keyring and start the agent remotely or type the passphrase many times, but straight from the FAQ this is not a good idea(TM).
Now the notorious question: Does anyone know how to forward the agent's socket to the remote machine? I've briefly tried socat (remote unix socket to tcp port, ssh tunnel of this port and then socat again to link the forwarded port to the existing socket) but so far to no avail.
Anyone with an idea how to accomplish this?
Thanks a lot in advance

Hi Daniel
I've thought about that, but these repos are a shared effort where the secret key is also shared by four trusted people - thus there is a source for race conditions - albeit the repos are not really that heavily used.
Thus maybe I should consider doing a 2-way sync:
let other people do their work and include their packages, rsync to my local machine, sign/export, rsync again to remote site - downside could be that I'm from time to time on very slow networks.
(other alternative is of course to rise to the benevolent dictator and just accept new packages by other users and include those myself and use your work So, maybe my question was just a very theoretical one :)
Thanks for the reply

@_subject: A better way to think about passwords 
I'd like to add a F-ACK to that statement, out of curiosity I tried cracking "J4fS<2" with CUDA multiforcer and it took less than 15 minutes on a single GF200 class card (the program tells me that it did about 490 million MD5 hashes per second)...
With that I'd estimate everything below 9 or 10 characters based on a random combination of these characters should be considered broken or very likely to be broken:  !"
I'm currently running the "quick brown fox" using a dictionary "attack" (also salted MD5 based), but that is usually only successful, if the correct combination rules are being considered...
Just my inflationary ?0.023

@_subject: What is the benefit of signing an encrypted email 
I suppose you mean thunderbird here, right?
Usually, you encrypt with the public key of the recipient, but sign with the help of your personal private key. Thus the recipient can we reasonably sure you sent this message, but no-one but him should be able to decipher it.
Does this help?
