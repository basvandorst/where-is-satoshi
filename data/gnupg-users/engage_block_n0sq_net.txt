@_subject: missing key during rpm --checksig 
Even though I added the redhat key to my keyring, I keep getting an error message that the key is missing. I did a gpg --list-key redhat and it shows the key on the keyring. Anyone have a clue? GnuPG 1.2.1, RedHat 9.

I don't know if the gnupg.org website was hacked but I have to state that such emotional political statements have no business on such a website. Such statements have nothing to do with the GnuPG product. Let's keep things

Until people quit making political statements that have nothing to do with GnuPG, I'm unsubscribing. These types of statements are inflammatory, also. I guess I need to find an alternative to GPG also.
Besides, Ghandi was an idiot. Do people really believe that people like Sadaam Hussein are going to say "Oh my God! They're not fighting back! It's time to relinquish power, quit supporting terrorists, quit killing people, and quit exploiting them!"?
Get real dude. If YOU were under the thumb of such a man, you'd be glad if the U.S. came to your rescue. I'm sure glad that I live in the U.S.
