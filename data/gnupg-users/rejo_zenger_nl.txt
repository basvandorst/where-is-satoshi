That's an interesting point of view - or there is some misunderstanding on my end. Let's say the NSA does not only surveil all kinds of communications as it does right now, but it also publishes this information ("open data" in governmental speak), then there is no oppression according to you?

I presume this is clear?
  rejo at broop-kidron:~/Downloads$ gpg --verify   TorBrowser-3.6.1-osx32_en-US.dmg.asc TorBrowser-3.6.1-osx32_en-US.dmg
  gpg: Signature made Wed May  7 01:36:52 2014 CEST
  gpg:                using RSA key 0x416F061063FEE659
  gpg: Good signature from "Erinn Clark " [full]
  gpg:                 aka "Erinn Clark " [full]
  gpg:                 aka "Erinn Clark " [full]
So, this tells you the (valid) signature has been made with the key 0x416F061063FEE659. Does that answer your question?

@_subject: Google releases beta OpenPGP code 
++ 04/06/14 10:32 +0200 - Werner Koch:
A few additional remarks:
 - Google talks about a limited group of users in their annoucement:
   "[...]  will probably only be used for very sensitive messages or by    those who need added protection. [...] will make it quicker and    easier for people to get that extra layer of security should they    need it." If they do not make a larger effort, the use of this plugin    will remain limited (and Google will not cannibalize their own    business model and still can make a good impression).
 - As Google already mentions: this type of encryption has been around    for quite a while but hasn't been picked up by the general public    due to the difficulties in creating a useful, secure and user    friendly user interfaces. Google still has this hurdle to take.

No. Google announced it will no longer do content scanning for advertising purposes in Apps for Education. Please take special note of the "for advertising purposses" and "for Education".

  "Search for Keys: allows you to search for a key on a keyserver.   (Keyserver)."

In other words, that works. Did you try to the application in debugging mode? . And, did you file a (bug) report to them? They are very responsive in the one case I ran into a bug.

@_subject: emails snowden and poitras 
At  there are some snippets of the e-mails Snowden sent to Poitras as an introduction. One of those e-mails says:
  "I would like to confirm out of email that the keys we exchanged were   not intercepted and replaced by your surveillants. Please confirm that   no one has ever had a copy of your private key and that it uses a   strong passphrase."
Of course, we don't have the full picture, but from the information that has been released, this seems to be surprising question: how would you be able to confirm that the keys are not replaced by asking to confirm that no one has ever had a copy of the private key? If they keys have been obtained by the adversary, the answer may be altered or not. In any case, the answer doesn't prove anything.
Of course, if Poitras would answer that her private key is in the hands of some other person, I expect her to have revoked to key anyways. So, what's the objective of Snowden, you think?
And yes, I am aware that Snowden says these steps are not bullet proof.

This will not work if the one who is being forged is keeping track of the tweets that are being sent from his or her account. In my case, I would most definately noticing a tweet on my account which wasn't of myself. But then again, I have a fairly strong password on my Twitter-account as well. :)

@_subject: cache gpg passphrase for mutt on os x 
I am running OS X 10.11.1 (and on another the latest version), in combination with compiled-from-source mutt 1.5.23hg, and gpg 2.0.29 and gpg-agent 2.0.29 (the latter two via Homebrew).
This all works fine, but one thing: caching of passphrase for, for example, ten minutes. As I understand it, this is a problem with the session mutt runs in: each new mutt decryption and signing operation runs in a new session and hence can't access the previous' one.
Probably, I can work around this, but to avoid spending hours of searching for a good solution: has anyone else done this before?
