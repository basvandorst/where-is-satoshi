Since we've just had a security related update to 1.4.6 and a security
related update to 1.4.7, I'd be hesitant to use or recommend 1.4.1.
There are Macs that can't upgrade beyond 10.3.9 and that will still work
fine with that system for many years to come.
Myself I tend to compile gnupg anyway, which IIRC never was much of a
problem on 10.3.9 anyway. But I understand that some people don't have
the knowledge or confidence to do that.
