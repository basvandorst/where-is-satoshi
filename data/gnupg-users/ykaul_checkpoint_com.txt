@_subject: Is there a protocol definition for fetching keys from key servers? 
I can see that port 11371 is registered for OpenPGP, and it seem to be using HTTP. However, the GET command is not entirely RFC compliant, ending with \r\n instead of \r\n\r\n.
Is there a documentation for that protocol?
(I'm using GPG 1.2.2).
