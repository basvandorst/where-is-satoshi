@_subject: Problems compiling gpa-0.7.0 using GCC 
Hash: SHA1
Hi everyone,
I apologize beforehand since I'm a newbie at all that concerns compiling.
I downloaded the source code of gpa-0.7.0 and in order to compile it I
did the following:
1) Installed Cygwin
2) Installed gtk+
3) Installed mingw32-gcc and its binutils
I ran the ./configure on the Cygwin bash client but was kicked out due
to the famous line:
"error: C compiler cannot create executables".
Looking at the config.log file I found the following line right before
the error message:
cannot open crt2.o: No such file or directory
I know this may be a rather vague description of the problem, but I'm
hoping, just hoping, that one of you may have run into this problem in
the past.
Your help will be greatly appreciated!!!
