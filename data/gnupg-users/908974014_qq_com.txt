@_subject: GnuPG modern can't genereate keys on my Windows 
I cleared the AppData and registry, installed  to D:\Program Files (x86)\GnuPG, started the command prompt, typed "gpg --full-gen-key --expert" and get an EOF error after I entered the password.

Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
        = key expires in n days
      w = key expires in n weeks
      m = key expires in n months
      y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 4y
Key expires at 08/30/19 12:23:32 China Standard Time
Is this correct? (y/N) y
GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
