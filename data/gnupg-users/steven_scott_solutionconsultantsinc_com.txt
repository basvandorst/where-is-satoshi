Actually, section 8 applies to the copyright holder (FSF) which allows
them to restrict the distribution of the software to the countries that have
the patent problem.  This does not conflict the patent statements of section
7, but would allow the copyright holder to restrict the distribution of the
software containing the patented code, to only those countries that do not
have the patent problem.  This would allow the FSF to include the IDEA code
in a distribution, but add a restriction that in can not be used in the US,
or other countries that have Patents on software.

EDI is large around North America with most large companies using the
format to exchange data.  The data exchanged tends to be (in my experience)
transaction record based data, such as an items information, with multiple
records for multiple items.  Where I worked with EDI, we received test
results for a piece from an outside lab via EDI.  Each transmission would
contain hundreds of pieces, with dozens of transaction lines per piece.
    EDI tended to be sent over costly permanent connections (direct lines,
etc) and is currently moving to the internet for a number of companies.  I
can see XML replacing EDI at some point, but I think EDI will still be
around for some time as it is easier (and less costly) to route the current
EDI transmissions via the internet, then it is to rebuild everything in XML.

Is it possible to get the script in question posted for all of us to see
and reference as we do our development?

Sounds like one of your development tools (the C compiler or something)
had all its licenses in use, and required an extra or free one to run.  You
could look at the start of ./configure to see which tool it might be.

The last time I did it, I did not have a password set either, so double
