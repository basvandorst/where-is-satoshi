@_subject: Question on using GPG with ASP on IIS 
First off, don't flame me for using GPG on ASP/IIS.
My question is simple.  Is there a good set of documentation on how to
use GPG with ASP/IIS.  I'm interested mostly in being able to encrypt a
message/text-string and then saves it to a file using a given user's key
that's in the key ring.
I've done this before using PGP but there doesn't seem to have a simple
solutions to do this using GPG.
Thanks for any help.

@_subject: Question in regard to decryption using multiple secret keys 
Hi there,
I have a question/problem that I'm not sure why it is not working.  I've
created multiple secret keys and they are all in my secret key rings.
When I encrypted a file to my default secret key (the very first key
that I generated), I have no problem decrypting it.  However, when I
encrypt a file using one of the other ones, when I tried to decrypt
them, I get an error msg saying that the file cannot be opened.
When I encrypt, I used:
gpg --armor --output o1.gpg --encrypt --recipient  When I decrypt, I'm using:
gpg --output o1.txt --local-user --decrypt o1.gpg
What am I doing wrong ? I'm using the latest version of gpg 1.0.6.
Thanks for any help.
