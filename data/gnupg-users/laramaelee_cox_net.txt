@_subject: default algorithms in gpg 1.0.6 
Hi, I've been trying to determine what the default cipher (symmetric key) and hash algorithm for version 1.0.6.  I looked into the gpg man pages and the GNU Privacy Handbook and haven't been able to find anything yet. I'm researching for a school project and appreciate any input.
