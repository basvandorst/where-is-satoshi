@_subject: publishing PGP keys in DNS 
Hi all,
I want to publish my GnuPG key in DNS, therefore I followed this Howto:
I can lookup the DNS entry and it looks OK to me:
$ dig +short bjoern._pka.schiessle.org. TXT
But if I try to test it with gpg like described in the Howto:
echo "foo" | gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /tmp/gpg-$$ --encrypt
--armor --auto-key-locate pka -r bjoern at schiessle.org
I get this error:
gpg: 0xE2BF04F6: skipped: No public key
gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: No public key
Any idea what's wrong?

Hi Werner,
thanks for the explanation.
Yesterday I already set this up successfully for my domain
(schiessle.org). I just thought that having the DNS record as well would
be a nice addition. But then I will just keep the WKD if this is the
recommended way.
One more question to the WKD. I changed my gpg.conf to:
auto-key-locate cert pka wkd keyserver
Does this means that gpg will try to find a WKD and a corresponding
public key automatically if I write a email to someone I don't have a
public key yet? Or will the lookup happen if I receive a mail?
