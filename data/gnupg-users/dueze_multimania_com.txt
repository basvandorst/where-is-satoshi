@_subject: Options file GPG Win32 
I use GPG Win32.
In my option file I have tried :
s2k-cipher-algo CAST5
s2k-digest-algo SHA1
cipher-algo CAST5
but it doesn't work : PGP can't verify the GPG signatures and can't decrypt
the GPG conventional encrypted files.
Could someone give me a typical "options" file to allow GnuPG Win32 to work
with PGP 6.x ?

No, I don't want to export a GPG keyring or secret key : I want to decrypt
I'm looking for a "options" file which can do that.

I have this error with the devlopment version GnuPG 1.1.1 :
gpg-agent: error binding address `/home/dueze/.gnupg-test/S.gpg-agent': no

Someone has this the problem?

Could you release a 1.0.2x version (both for Unix and Win32) with this new
feature ?

@_subject: GPG 1.0.2 Win32 and wrap 
What is the option command to wrap the paragraphs in GPG? With PGP 7.0 beta
for Windows, I have a bad signature because GPG win32 doesn't break the
lines (--clearsign command).

@_subject: GPG win32 and Internationalization support 
I have followed the Readme.w32 instructions, but it's impossible to have
the french language.
Has someone tested with success the Internationalization support of the
Win32 GPG 102 version ?

OK, I have understood the stuff and it works.
The Readme.w32 must be read as:
Into the Registry:
1. create the key:
  \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Mingw32\NLS
2. create the valor string:
  MODir
3. modifiy it to have:
  MODir   "c:/gnu/locale/fr"
and then:
4. Select which language to use and copy the currect translation file
under the name "gnupg.mo" into the directory set in step 3
  (Example: "copy fr.mo c:\gnu\locale\fr\gnupg.mo")
5. Done.
Sorry for having misunderstood the configuration of Windoz... ;-)

@_subject: GPG win32 problems with PGP 6.5.3/7.0 
Using GnuPG 1.0.2 for Win32, I have problems with PGP for Windows.
Public encryption, conventional encryption, signatures, detached
signatures, with or without armor, aren't recognized by PGP 6.5.3 and 7.0
beta 176 ("bad signature", "bad packet", "invalid password").
With PGP 7.0, --clearsign is OK but it fails in PGP 6.5.3.
GnuPG seems to recognize all signatures and encrypted files produced by PGP
for Windows.
Is there an incompatibility with symmetric or public algorithms between
GnuPG win32 and PGP?

@_subject: RSA extension with W32 version 
I guess that the RSA extension can be used with Win32 version
(theorically). I am right ?
It would be fine that someone compiles for Win32 the RSA and IDEA sources
to have a PGP 2.x compatible version for Windows (unfortunately, I have not
the tools and knowledge to do that).
