Nothing.  This is a bug in 1.2.0.  There will be a proper fix soon,
but in the meantime you can apply this patch.

@_subject: old keypairs (NAI pgp) with gnupg 
I've got some old keypairs that I'd like to revoke - I still have the
passphrase, and when I generate a revoke certificate, all works well.  When
I try to import it though, it doesn't work, it fails with this message
gpg: key 9D71D459: invalid revocation certificate: general error - rejected
gpg: error reading `revoke1.asc': general error
gpg: import from `revoke1.asc' failed: general error
gpg: Total number processed: 0
any help is greatly appreciated.
