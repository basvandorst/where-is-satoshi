Actually, they are very closely related. PGPnet is an IPsec implementation
that allows for the use of PGP authentication/encryption by both parties.
It is part of the PGP suite. (Remember that PGP is not just the OpenPGP
program; it is also PGPdisk, PGPnet, and the related plugins.) One
*should* associate the security that comes with PGP together with
PGPnet; PGPnet is only as secure as PGP itself.

That was my original point. (Though as PGPnet shows, IPsec implementations
can use OpenPGP keys as part of the session creation process.) GnuPG isn't
an IPsec program. It would probably be more reasonable to expect FreeS/Wan
to integrate PGP support.
BTW, has anyone here gotten FreeS/Wan to work? :)

Well, I didn't view this as an argument as such... I was simply countering
your statement that PGPnet is only weakly related to the PGP product
(which includes the OpenPGP file and email encryption mechanisms, PGPdisk,
PGPwipe, and PGPnet). Saying that is like saying Netscape Messenger is
only weakly related to Netscape Navigator, or Netscape Communicator.
Navigator and Messenger are both main components of Netscape Communicator.
Or it's like saying my foot is only weakly related to my hand. :)
True, PGPnet is an IPsec implementation and not an OpenPGP implementation,
but in the context of PGP they are related. Will Price has some Internet
drafts describing the relationship.

Be sure you are using a cipher that both products can understand. 3DES is
the most logical, since it is required by RFC 2440. CAST is the default
cipher in PGP, and Blowfish in GnuPG. PGP does not implement Blowfish, so
this is most likely your problem.

I personally believe that defaulting to 3DES would make sense, for any
OpenPGP product. But that's just a personal opinion. And I think that
being compatable with the other OpenPGP implementations is imporant...
Okay, get your facts straight. Aside from the photo-id packet issue, which
would have/should have been in the RFC had it not been brought up rather
late in the cycle, PGP is compatable with RFC 2440. If someone knows of
any other issue of non-compliance, please let me know. PGP 5.x is not
compliant. Why? There was no standard to comply *with*. So I don't care
about 5.x violations. Show me 6.0 non-compliance issues, other than the
photo-id packet. Please. (And by the way, OpenPGP *is* an emulation of PGP
Inc.'s product. ;) )
As for the reasons for not implementing Blowfish, that's simple. It isn't
necessary. PGP implements all the MUST and SHOULD algorithms. Incidently,
GnuPG doesn't; implementing IDEA and RSA are SHOULDs. I understand
Werner's reasoning, and I am sure that RSA support will be present as soon
as the patent expires.
Adding Blowfish wouldn't give the user anything more than they already
have, in my opinion. CAST5, 3DES, IDEA, and Twofish are more than
Note, also, that GnuPG does not use DSS by default. The jury is still out
on the effectiveness of RIPEMD160 in place of SHA-1 when used with DSA. It
could be just as secure, but "could be's" are not usually something you
want to mess with in cryptography.

And I meant to continue and say that PGP doesn't recognise signatures made
with DSA that don't comply with DSS. Thus, you can use RIPEMD160 with RSA,
but if used with DSA (the default in GnuPG) it will result in a "BAD
SIG" warning if verified with PGP.

[snip example]
Okay, I stand corrected. I must confess, I didn't test it... I just
assumed from the man page that RIPEMD160 was the default:
       --s2k-digest-algo name
                 Use  name as the digest algorithm used to mangle
                 the passphrases.  The default algorithm is RIPE-
                 MD-160.   This digest algorithm is also used for
                 conventional encryption if --digest-algo is  not
                 given.
... but then of course when I went back and checked it again, I realized I
had thought I was looking at "--digest-algo".
But the point is still valid to those who wish to tweak their settings for
no reason: using RIPEMD160 instead of SHA-1 with DSA keys makes them not
DSS. It is my recommendation that people use SHA-1 with DSA keys unless at
some point they are given good reason not to trust SHA-1.

Remember, though, that creating a key with the preferences of one OpenPGP
implementation may cause you some trouble if you then use that key with an
OpenPGP implementation that doesn't support some of those ciphers you had
specified as accepted in the key.
And example: Key is generated with GnuPG. Blowfish is preferred. Key is
then moved to system using PGP. Public key is given to someone using
GnuPG. Message is sent, using Blowfish (on account of the prefs). The
recipient cannot view the message, because PGP doesn't have Blowfish.
This seems to be a FAQ on this and the PGP-Users lists.
As it doesn't look like Blowfish is going to be implemented in PGP, I'd
like to see GnuPG give the option to exclude it from the preferences when
keys are generated in GnuPG.

Ah, politics. I love the fact that practically all of the AES candidates
have non-US cryptographers working on them... :)
Regardless of who developed SHA-1, it is the opinion of numerous
well-respected cryptographers both in the USA and abroad that it is sound,
and that DSS is correct in requiring it.
An aside: those mysterious S-Box values in DES turned out to be not a back
door placed by No Such Agency, but instead a clever construction to defend
against differential cryptanalysis. When the NSA does things, they
generally do them well... DES is cryptographically sound; 56 bit is just
too damn small now.
SHA-1 is far less controversial than the DES S-Boxes. RIPEMD160 could be
just as good, but I trust SHA-1 with DSS more simply based on the
collective opinion of the industry experts.

That's a silly statement.
Not following SHOULDs, unless there is a very good reason, is bad. Photo-ID and what else? Nothing. And the photo ID breaks nothing,
either. Packet 17 is unused. If it were assigned to something else, and
there was a conflict there, then things would be broken. The fact is the
WG was told about the photo ID, and in my opinion should have made
allowances for it. (The proposal was for a "biometric data packet" that
could contain things like photos, fingerprints, voice-prints, etc.)
And, if you follow the suggestion of the draft:
       However, if
       an implementation wishes to be compatible with such keys, the
       packet may be considered to be a user id packet with opaque
       contents.
(As GnuPG does, I believe -- or does it just trim them from the key?), PGP
keys play happiliy with GnuPG.

I was not judging the particular case of not including IDEA and RSA. In
fact, the modules almost make up for it (the RSA module doesn't permit key
generation, I don't believe). But I was just pointing out that SHOULD
statements are meant to be followed.
If the WG assigned packet 17 to something else, then there would be a
problem. As it is now, Packet 17 is effectively assigned to the
Photo-ID; it just isn't official. I hope the WG makes it so, as the
Photo-ID is not going away, and adding it to the draft would clear up a

Mainly non-technical. In order to use RSA in the US, you need to either
use BSAFE (with a license) or RSAREF (for free). PGP used to have a
custom-written RSA implementation that was a lot faster than BSAFE, but we
can't use it. Yet. :)
Also, v3 keys aren't as good as v4 keys. With v4 keys, you can have
a different key for signing then for encrypting (actually, it is necessary
if you choose to use DSS as the signing key). RSA v4 keys are possible as
well, and pose no real security advantages or disadvantages; two RSA keys
are created, and one is designated the signing key and the other the
encrypting key. So it isn't really RSA the algorithm that is the problem,
it is v3 keys and the RSA legal mess. Both of which are going away.

Yes, it does. So if you only plan to correspond with other GnuPG users,
you are probably okay (unless there are more problems with ElGamal we
aren't aware of yet, which would not surprise me). But I can't see the
point in using ElGamal, when there are no advantages over DSS/DH, you have
to trust the implementors to do it correctly (and conceivably, your
correspondent could be using something other than GnuPG that doesn't
implement it securely). And the topic of discussion was originally Windows
PGP compatability; PGP doesn't and will never support ElGamal signing.
A debate about the merits of ElGamal keys is probably not what this list

Actually, they are very closely related. PGPnet is an IPsec implementation

It is part of the PGP suite. (Remember that PGP is not just the OpenPGP

PGPwipe, and PGPnet). Saying that is like saying Netscape Messenger is
only weakly related to Netscape Navigator, or Netscape Communicator.
Navigator and Messenger are both main components of Netscape Communicator.
Or it's like saying my foot is only weakly related to my hand. :)
True, PGPnet is an IPsec implementation and not an OpenPGP implementation,
but in the context of PGP they are related. Will Price has some Internet

Be sure you are using a cipher that both products can understand. 3DES is
the most logical, since it is required by RFC 2440. CAST is the default

this is most likely your problem.

I personally believe that defaulting to 3DES would make sense, for any

being compatable with the other OpenPGP implementations is imporant...
Okay, get your facts straight. Aside from the photo-id packet issue, which
would have/should have been in the RFC had it not been brought up rather
late in the cycle, PGP is compatable with RFC 2440. If someone knows of
any other issue of non-compliance, please let me know. PGP 5.x is not
compliant. Why? There was no standard to comply *with*. So I don't care
about 5.x violations. Show me 6.0 non-compliance issues, other than the
photo-id packet. Please. (And by the way, OpenPGP *is* an emulation of PGP
Inc.'s product. ;) )
As for the reasons for not implementing Blowfish, that's simple. It isn't
necessary. PGP implements all the MUST and SHOULD algorithms. Incidently,
GnuPG doesn't; implementing IDEA and RSA are SHOULDs. I understand
Werner's reasoning, and I am sure that RSA support will be present as soon
as the patent expires.
Adding Blowfish wouldn't give the user anything more than they already
have, in my opinion. CAST5, 3DES, IDEA, and Twofish are more than
Note, also, that GnuPG does not use DSS by default. The jury is still out
on the effectiveness of RIPEMD160 in place of SHA-1 when used with DSA. It

want to mess with in cryptography.

Okay, I stand corrected. I must confess, I didn't test it... I just
assumed from the man page that RIPEMD160 was the default:
       --s2k-digest-algo name
                 Use  name as the digest algorithm used to mangle
                 the passphrases.  The default algorithm is RIPE-
                 MD-160.   This digest algorithm is also used for
                 conventional encryption if --digest-algo is  not
                 given.
... but then of course when I went back and checked it again, I realized I
had thought I was looking at "--digest-algo".
But the point is still valid to those who wish to tweak their settings for
no reason: using RIPEMD160 instead of SHA-1 with DSA keys makes them not
DSS. It is my recommendation that people use SHA-1 with DSA keys unless at
some point they are given good reason not to trust SHA-1.

:signature packet: algo 100, keyid 0000000000000000
        version 4, created 952495317, md5len 0, sigclass 10

        hashed subpkt 100 len 995 (?)
        unknown algorithm 100
I don't know about previous versions, but in 6.5.3 it is subpacket number
100 (internal or user defined).
I personally think it would be nice for X.509 certificates to get a
dedicated packet number, but in any case the current method is in
compliance with OpenPGP.

Ah, politics. I love the fact that practically all of the AES candidates
have non-US cryptographers working on them... :)
Regardless of who developed SHA-1, it is the opinion of numerous
well-respected cryptographers both in the USA and abroad that it is sound,
and that DSS is correct in requiring it.
An aside: those mysterious S-Box values in DES turned out to be not a back
door placed by No Such Agency, but instead a clever construction to defend
against differential cryptanalysis. When the NSA does things, they
generally do them well... DES is cryptographically sound; 56 bit is just
too damn small now.
SHA-1 is far less controversial than the DES S-Boxes. RIPEMD160 could be
just as good, but I trust SHA-1 with DSS more simply based on the
collective opinion of the industry experts.

That's a silly statement.
Not following SHOULDs, unless there is a very good reason, is bad. Photo-ID and what else? Nothing. And the photo ID breaks nothing,
either. Packet 17 is unused. If it were assigned to something else, and
there was a conflict there, then things would be broken. The fact is the
WG was told about the photo ID, and in my opinion should have made
allowances for it. (The proposal was for a "biometric data packet" that
could contain things like photos, fingerprints, voice-prints, etc.)
And, if you follow the suggestion of the draft:
       However, if
       an implementation wishes to be compatible with such keys, the
       packet may be considered to be a user id packet with opaque
       contents.
(As GnuPG does, I believe -- or does it just trim them from the key?), PGP
keys play happiliy with GnuPG.

I was not judging the particular case of not including IDEA and RSA. In
fact, the modules almost make up for it (the RSA module doesn't permit key
generation, I don't believe). But I was just pointing out that SHOULD
statements are meant to be followed.
If the WG assigned packet 17 to something else, then there would be a
problem. As it is now, Packet 17 is effectively assigned to the
Photo-ID; it just isn't official. I hope the WG makes it so, as the
Photo-ID is not going away, and adding it to the draft would clear up a
potential problem with the standard.

Mainly non-technical. In order to use RSA in the US, you need to either
use BSAFE (with a license) or RSAREF (for free). PGP used to have a
custom-written RSA implementation that was a lot faster than BSAFE, but we
can't use it. Yet. :)
Also, v3 keys aren't as good as v4 keys. With v4 keys, you can have
a different key for signing then for encrypting (actually, it is necessary
if you choose to use DSS as the signing key). RSA v4 keys are possible as
well, and pose no real security advantages or disadvantages; two RSA keys
are created, and one is designated the signing key and the other the
encrypting key. So it isn't really RSA the algorithm that is the problem,
it is v3 keys and the RSA legal mess. Both of which are going away.

Yes, it does. So if you only plan to correspond with other GnuPG users,
you are probably okay (unless there are more problems with ElGamal we
aren't aware of yet, which would not surprise me). But I can't see the
point in using ElGamal, when there are no advantages over DSS/DH, you have
to trust the implementors to do it correctly (and conceivably, your
correspondent could be using something other than GnuPG that doesn't
implement it securely). And the topic of discussion was originally Windows
PGP compatability; PGP doesn't and will never support ElGamal signing.
A debate about the merits of ElGamal keys is probably not what this list

Werner's the one writing the software. Consequently, if the IDEA patent
holders get upset, he's the one they'd come after. So it's perfectly
reasonable for him to be cautious.
Have I ever mentioned that patenting math is disgusting?
BTW, currently there *is* a bug in the GnuPG regarding RSA. It is not
possible to encrypt and sign a message if you are using an RSA v3
key. (Well, you can do the encrypt/sign operation, but it creates a
literal packet where it shouldn't, and consequently PGP can't decrypt it,
because it treats the signature as a detached sig.)
I am fairly certain this was mentioned on the list already... if not, I
can dig through my mail and find the details for you, Werner.

ELG (ElGamal signing) is not supported by PGP, because it is not secure
enough. There are many ways of implementing it incorrectly (which I
believe Werner has avoided), but there could be many more problems that
turn up later, and there is no guarantee that other implementations would
implement it correctly. (Bad things like leaking the secret key material
when making signatures can occur. It's ugly.)
For some reason, the encryption subkey in PGP is called "DH". It's really
ElGamal Encryption (ELG-E). [Simplified explaination] DSS is a paper that describes a standard for
digital signatures. It mandates the useage of DSA with SHA-1. The actual
algorithm used in PGP is DSA, but it is used in conformance with DSS (the
hash is SHA-1). If you use RIPEMD160, for instance, you couldn't call DSA
Mostly correct. Just disable that ELG support, and add the RSA and IDEA
modules (provided it's leagal where you are).

Yes. It's definately not a patch. I'll go into the differences if need be...
GnuPG cannot generate rsa v3 keys. I am told that after sept 20, rsa v4
keys will be able to be generated, and there will be no more rsa
module. (rsa v3 and v4 support will be included in GnuPG. Note that PGP
7.0 will also create v4 RSA keys).
Yep. Just be sure to have the --force-v3-sigs option turned on. (PGP 7.0
will handle v4 sigs, but earlier versions don't on non key material.) I
think that is default in the config file, though.

There aren't different versions of "RSA keys"; there are different
versions of PGP keys. PGP 1.0 used v1. 2.0 --> 2.5 used v2. 2.6 --> 4.x
(but not 3.x) used v3. PGP 5.0 introduced v4 keys for DSA/Elg, but still
used v3 for RSA.
They have all the standard v4 key features, but have RSA signing and
encryption keys. (Yes, they are separate keys, unlike in v3).
I'm sure someone has a faq on this, and my net connection is shaky right
now, so I won't elaborate any further. If you're *really* interested in
the nitty-gritty, read the ertanent parts of RFC 2440. ;)

@_subject: GnuPG manual doubt 
Hash: SHA1
A "salt" is a set of bits added to the encryption process. I am not
sure how it applies directly with GPG, but it is most commonly known for its
use in Morris's crypt() function in Unix.
crypt() takes two arguments: the password, and a salt. The salt does not
make the password any less difficult to brute force, but it does limit the
possibility that two encrypted passwords can be identified as being the same.
In other words, if I use the password "password" on thetis.quickie.net and
on prometheus.quickie.net, someone looking at the password files wouldn't
be able to tell they are the same. (shadow password files make this
application of salting unnecessary, but that is where it is most commonly
recognised as being used, and why).
When I run:
perl -e 'print crypt( "password", "AA" ) . "\n";'
                                   ^^ this is the salt
It produces this:
^^ Here is the salt in the output.
perl -e 'print crypt( "password", "AB" ) . "\n";'
                                   ^^ different salt
Different output of crypt()
You can see that by "salting" the password, you can produce a totally
different encrypted string. No one would know that "AA6tQYSfGxd/A" and
"ABRCL9ijBr2LY" are both "password".
(Much like adding salts or seasons to a soup can change the taste
[Yes, I know that in crypt(), the passwords are not actually
encrypted; instead, a long string of zeros is encrypted with the
password. I am simplifying for the sake of clarity...]
If anyone wants to tell us exactly where salting is used in GPG, (what
algorithms, etc., please do. I am interested. :)
And re: mangle.. I would assume that is used as a synonym for
"obfuscate" or "obscure". Is "mangle" an actual cryptographic term?

Hash: SHA1
Does GnuPG have a method of automatically requesting from a keyserver all
keys that have signed a particular key?
i.e., if I were to list-sigs 0x621CC013, and there were multiple unknown
keyids on signatures on Werner's key, could I issue a command to obtain
all of the keys that signed his key that were not already on my keyring?
I don't think that such an option exists, but it might be there an
undocumented. :)
If not, consider this an official feature request. Thanks! :)

@_subject: GnuPG manual doubt 
Hash: SHA1
A "salt" is a set of bits added to the encryption process. I am not
sure how it applies directly with GPG, but it is most commonly known for its
use in Morris's crypt() function in Unix.
crypt() takes two arguments: the password, and a salt. The salt does not
make the password any less difficult to brute force, but it does limit the
possibility that two encrypted passwords can be identified as being the same.
In other words, if I use the password "password" on thetis.quickie.net and
on prometheus.quickie.net, someone looking at the password files wouldn't
be able to tell they are the same. (shadow password files make this
application of salting unnecessary, but that is where it is most commonly
recognised as being used, and why).
When I run:
perl -e 'print crypt( "password", "AA" ) . "\n";'
                                   ^^ this is the salt
It produces this:
^^ Here is the salt in the output.
perl -e 'print crypt( "password", "AB" ) . "\n";'
                                   ^^ different salt
Different output of crypt()
You can see that by "salting" the password, you can produce a totally
different encrypted string. No one would know that "AA6tQYSfGxd/A" and
"ABRCL9ijBr2LY" are both "password".
(Much like adding salts or seasons to a soup can change the taste
[Yes, I know that in crypt(), the passwords are not actually
encrypted; instead, a long string of zeros is encrypted with the
password. I am simplifying for the sake of clarity...]
If anyone wants to tell us exactly where salting is used in GPG, (what
algorithms, etc., please do. I am interested. :)
And re: mangle.. I would assume that is used as a synonym for
"obfuscate" or "obscure". Is "mangle" an actual cryptographic term?

Actually, we (the notaries) don't travel. You do. If you want me to
notarize you, you have to come to me. :p
How is that a bad idea? It's a great idea. They just don't do it right.
Hrmm. Seems like you haven't read up on how their program works. =) You
need to start off with a PGP key or an X.509 CSR. You can then get more
information added to your certificate data and signed by them, as you gain
more points. These points are granted through their notary system.
This works for X.509. It does not apply to PGP, and is quite stupid in
that context. They make numerous mistakes, such as signing the 3 different
levels of the program with the same signing key; they violate etiquette by
adding unauthorized UIDs to one's key (I didn't *want* "Thawte Freemail
Member" attached to my key), and they have a sloppy chaining system for
their signing keys.
nit: "GnuPG Key" and "newer PGP key" are the same thing.
They also just got bought by Verisign. Do you expect them to keep
supporting PGP? Complete garbage. Don't waste your time on the PGP stuff.

The longer the lifetime of a key, the more likely the key is to be
compromised. If you chose to retire a key, be sure to link your new key
with the old by signing it with the old before the old key expires.
Note that you can make use of the fact that multiple subkeys are permitted
in OpenPGP to address this issue partially: you expire your encryption
keys, but keep your signing key the same.

They work perfectly fine together.
Mutt refuses to recognise the standard signed message format, and instead
uses the PGP/MIME format, which isn't widely supported. It is for this
reason I don't use Mutt. I believe there are some procmail scripts to
convert incoming messages into the kludgy PGP/MIME format, however.
Yes, in fact, is must to be OpenPGP.

The longer the lifetime of a key, the more likely the key is to be
compromised. If you chose to retire a key, be sure to link your new key
with the old by signing it with the old before the old key expires.
Note that you can make use of the fact that multiple subkeys are permitted
in OpenPGP to address this issue partially: you expire your encryption
keys, but keep your signing key the same.

Not only does pine (as well as many other mailers) not handle it well, but
it is pointless unless you are sending other attachments MIME encoded.
If you were to send a plain text message, with no attachments, would you
use MIME? Then why use MIME for PGP? ASCII-Armored messages are the
standard. And they work very well.

Sure thing. "Fingerprints" are unique identifiers for keys. They are a
hash output of the key material. (v3 and v4 keys are a little different as
far as fingerprints are concerned; I won't go into specifics here.)
Basically, they are useful in determining that a key belongs to a
particular person. You call him or her on the phone (provided you can
trust the phone... ) and ask him to read his fingerprint to you. You
compare it with the ones you got from a key server, and the key with the
same fingerprint is the real one.
This makes sure that someone doesn't make a key with the same uid and
keyid as the real one, in order to pull off a man in the middle attack, or
similar compromise of security.

It is extremely unlikely, however possible, that two keys would share the
same fingerprint. Obviously, the key data is larger then the fingerprint
data, so overlaps are theoretically possible.
However, other than brute-force generation of keys to match an existing
key, an attacker would not be able to do what you propose... unless, of
course, the hash algorithm is flawed. Neither SHA-1 (required if the key
is DSS) or RIPEMD160 have any known attacks against them. MD5 has been
proven to be insecure.
Of course, the birthday attack scenerio is always an issue with
hashes... so if you are just looking to generate two keys that share a
fingerprint, your task is much easier than matching the fingerprint of an
existing key.
To date, there are no accidental (or known intentional) fingerprint

Blowfish, instead of Twofish. (Bug, Werner?) To be decrypted in PGP 6.5.x, the message must use CAST, IDEA, or 3DES as
the ESK.
To be the most compatable with all implementations of OpenPGP, one should
3DES, as this will be present in all OpenPGP compliant programs. (IDEA and
CAST5 are "shoulds", 3DES is a "must".) You are taking a chance with the
others, if you plan to move the secret keys to a different program in the
Note that this incompatability only applies to keys generated in one
program, and imported and used in another.
You could keep the old key and work around this by adding a new UID with a
different preferred algorithm specified, and encrypting to that.

Sure thing. "Fingerprints" are unique identifiers for keys. They are a
hash output of the key material. (v3 and v4 keys are a little different as
far as fingerprints are concerned; I won't go into specifics here.)
Basically, they are useful in determining that a key belongs to a
particular person. You call him or her on the phone (provided you can
trust the phone... ) and ask him to read his fingerprint to you. You
compare it with the ones you got from a key server, and the key with the
same fingerprint is the real one.
This makes sure that someone doesn't make a key with the same uid and
keyid as the real one, in order to pull off a man in the middle attack, or
similar compromise of security.

It is extremely unlikely, however possible, that two keys would share the
same fingerprint. Obviously, the key data is larger then the fingerprint
data, so overlaps are theoretically possible.
However, other than brute-force generation of keys to match an existing
key, an attacker would not be able to do what you propose... unless, of
course, the hash algorithm is flawed. Neither SHA-1 (required if the key
is DSS) or RIPEMD160 have any known attacks against them. MD5 has been
proven to be insecure.
Of course, the birthday attack scenerio is always an issue with
hashes... so if you are just looking to generate two keys that share a
fingerprint, your task is much easier than matching the fingerprint of an
existing key.
To date, there are no accidental (or known intentional) fingerprint

ftp://ftp.inf.ethz.ch/pub/publications/papers/ti/isc/ElGamal.ps discusses
the signature verification problem. This is the one that concerns me most,
since GnuPG users have no control over what the recipient's OpenPGP
program is. However, there is also an issue with key generation. From RFC 2440:
   If an Elgamal key is to be used for both signing and encryption,
   extra care must be taken in creating the key.
   An ElGamal key consists of a generator g, a prime modulus p, a
   secret exponent x, and a public value y = g^x mod p.
   The generator and prime must be chosen so that solving the discrete
   log problem is intractable.  The group g should generate the
   multiplicative group mod p-1 or a large subgroup of it, and the
   order of g should have at least one large prime factor.  A good
   choice is to use a "strong" Sophie-Germain prime in choosing p, so
   that both p and (p-1)/2 are primes. In fact, this choice is so good
   that implementors SHOULD do it, as it avoids a small subgroup
   attack.
Well, that's not exactly what I said. I said that Blowfish wasn't as
respected as some of the other algorithms, including Twofish (which is
newer, and thus has not had as much time to be reviewed as Blowfish.
Twofish is an AES candidate, though, so it has had a lot of scrutiny.)
And certain things, like Blowfish and ElGamal signing keys, won't ever be
in PGP... so I don't think it would be unreasonable for there to be a note
about this in GnuPG (i.e., "Don't use this if you need/want compatability
with PGP).

@_subject: S/MIME or PGP/MIME? 
Yes, but at least the user is aware of this.
Define "good". I tend to think of "good" as "complying with standards",
and in that sense, all good S/MIME implementations would use weak crypto.
Let's assume, however, that your client doesn't use 40 bit keys. You still
have no control over what type of S/MIME enabled mailer I am using. If I
am using one that defaults to 40 bit, you can't do anything about it.
Contrast this with OpenPGP (which never had 40 bit crypto in the first
place) which lets the public key owner exclude individual ciphers from
being used. If I don't trust CAST5, I can instruct all OpenPGP clients
never to use it when encrypting to my key.
If S/MIME had that sort of functionality, the fact that it requires
support for 40 bit crypto would not be so dangerous.
Okay, then. It's on the other laptop... will look.

Same as above.
Not just preferred -- it permits you to disallow ciphers, period.
Yes, you can, though this is shoe-horned in as an afterthought, and not
all clients understand it. So you're back to the original problem of
trusting that the people with whom you are communicating are using a
"good" client.

1.4 Compatibility with Prior Practice of S/MIME
   S/MIME version 3 agents should attempt to have the greatest
   interoperability possible with S/MIME version 2 agents.
Which, in effect, means that v3 inherits all of the flaws of v2 in many
I think v3 fixed the fact that S/MIME messages store the signature
outside the encrypted envelope. Heh. In PEM, you couldn't even send
"encrypted, not signed" messages. So, progress is getting made, slowly...
but when security matters, no risk can be brushed off as "exaggerated."

Extra signatures on your key don't harm anything (from a security/trust
standpoint), as far as you are concerned. (They do clutter up your key,
and I can see why you're annoyed that the signature is there.)
The person who is adversely affected by this situation is the one who
signed your key without doing verification.

I don't know the section number off the top of my head, and don't have the
time right now to look it up (but it is in the signature subpacket
Basically, if this subpacket is set no-modify=yes in the self sig, the key
server will reject updates to the key that do not come from the key owner.
(So, if you want to add other people's signatures to your key, you would
need them to sign the key, and provide you a copy of the signed key. You
would then submit it to the key server yourself.)
(We're working on a key server Internet Draft. I assume your next question
is "how does the key server verify ownership." That is up to the
implementation. NAI's Keyserver 7.0 uses the LDAPS connection, extablished
with the primary key in question, to do this.)
So, in order to use this feature, you need the bit set on your key (which
you can do with GnuPG. Once it is set, it doesn't matter what your primary
PGP application is.) You also need to be using key servers that recognise
this function. So far, NAI's implementation is the only one that does so.

And furthermore, this varies by degrees as well.
Some people have "high-security" signing keys, which they use to sign
keys belong to people of whose identity they are absolutely positive; "low
security keys" they use to sign online acquaintences' keys; pseudonym
signing keys, etc.
As a user of the Web of Trust, you need to take into consideration the
signing policies of a given key before you would trust it as an introducer
of trust yourself.
(A side note -- there is a useful feature in OpenPGP that allows you to
add a pointer to the CPS, or signing policy for a given key, into the
signature being made. Use --set-policy-url to do this.)

True; however, that function of OpenPGP isn't all that useful, in my
opinion. One person's extensively is another person's casually, though
this isn't the biggest drawback. There isn't a way to set a trusted
introducer that only introduces keys that have been checked "extensively".
It's an all or nothing decision.

Because you aren't supposed to use it.
(Oh, did you mean "Why aren't we supposed to use this module?")
skipjack isn't part of OpenPGP, first of all. Secondly, it's a weak cipher
developed by the NSA to provide an algorithm that could support key
escrow. (Though there were weaknesses discovered, that the NSA wasn't
aware of, after it was released.)
I have no idea why anyone would ever want to use it.

"The outdated standard for making attached signatures was to paste it at
the bottom of the message, but the new standard involves an actual MIME
attachment to the message.  Regardless, Mutt can verify either style."
This is not correct. The only people who refer to the inline ASCII-armored
signatures as "outdated" are the Mutt developers. Read the RFCs.
Frankly, it's poor netiquette to post PGP/MIME messages to mailing lists,
for one, and secondly, most mail clients cannot understand them. Signing
your messages in a way that renders the signature useless for most PGP
users serves no purpose whatsoever.
Inline ASCII-armoring is the standard method for signing email. It is also
the only method directly specified in RFC 2440.
An important part of any GnuPG/Mutt FAQ would be instructions on how to
configure Mutt to make compatible OpenPGP signatures in the traditional
method. (No, this does not mean the broken Application/PGP method that
Mutt offers!)
(This is not to say I don't recognise the value of PGP/MIME (and the new
OpenPGP/MIME.) But crypto is worthless if it doesn't interoperate. When
the majority of PGP-aware mail apps can understand PGP/MIME, then I'll
advocate switching for non-mailing list email.)

This is a problem with the Horowitz keyservers. pksd doesn't understand
what to do with multiple subkeys, and munges them (usually by deleting all

@_subject: Signature key length limitations 
Why? It makes more sense to use RSA keys now than it did last decade, when
there were patent problems.
There are pitfalls that can result in key compromise in doing ElGamal
signatures. No other OpenPGP implimentation supports them, whereas all
modern OpenPGP implimentations support RSA v4 keys.

@_date: 2002-08-21 04:53:02
@_author: Len Sassaman 
@_subject: Signature key length limitations 
Yep, likely.
Right. RSA v3 keys (the RSA keys that PGP 2.x used) have a number of
problems with them, and are rightfully depricated.
GnuPG can interact with RSA v3 keys (old-style RSA keys), but if you
generate an RSA key with GnuPG, it will be V4, and have all the associated
properties. (Just like DSA v4 keys, it will have a primary key for
signing, and a subkey for encryption. These are actually two seperate RSA
Not entirely. PGP and GnuPG added support for RSA v4 keys at about the
same time -- two years ago -- which means that PGP 7.x and up supports RSA
v4 keys, but previous versions do not have full support.
Previous versions of PGP should probably be upgraded, though.

pgp-keyserver-folk already knows about this problem. You're using a
keyserver that is either running pksd or OpenKeyServer, neither of which
are really very robust or OpenPGP-aware.
You'll have much better luck using a keyserver that is either running NAI
Keyserver 7.0 or CKS. Examples: keyserver.pgp.com, horowitz.surfnet.nl
(over LDAP only!), gnv.us.ks.cryptnet.net.
(In short, the broken keyserver software sees that the key you sent it is
RSA, and calculates the keyid as though it were a v3 keyid. It goes
downhill from there.)

@_subject: implications of subkeys? 
So, the idea behind signing subkeys is pretty cool, but the drawback is it
takes an already overly complicated system and makes it that much more
complicated. (This is why, I believe, PGP doesn't support it. Although I
do wish that PGP understood such keys...)
The basic idea is that you can collect your trust (signatures from other
people) on the master signing key, which binds the subkeys to itself.
Then, when you retire old keys and generate new ones (you do do this on a
regular basis, right?) you don't have to worry about regaining trust,
since trust isn't calculated on subkeys.
This isn't actually needed, however, due to a trick in the PGP trust
model that isn't too widely known:
If a key A bearing a given user-id signs a key B with an identicial
user-id (and the signature is made on that identical user id) then trust
for key B is calculated as though all the signatures for this shared
user-id on key A were made on key B. This was introduced around the time
of PGP 3.0, to prevent an RSA/DSA divide in the web of trust.

As a side note, that should actually read "PGP 5.x and 6.x recognise...".
It wasn't until 7.0 that, at my suggestion, v4 signatures on non-key
material were recognised. (Note that PGP still makes v3 signatures on
non-key material, for obvious compatability reasons.)
Well, it wouldn't be the same signature, obviously... but yes, that's
basically what it says. If a v4 signature is made on a v4 key, PGP 5.x has
no problem reading it. If a v4 signature is made on a file, PGP will (I
believe) treat it as though it is a v3 sig, and the signature will not

me offlist if you're interested.

material would be useful.

@_subject: How to disable/delete key from keyservers 
Note that you can delete keys from the key server if you a) have a copy of
the private key, which seems to be the case, are using certain OpenPGP
implementations that support this, and are using a key server that has
this feature enabled.
Probably the best course of action, since there is no guarantee that
someone else wouldn't upload the original key back to the server after you
deleted it.

@_subject: duplicate keyid survey results 
The thing that comes to mind immediately for me is that you should allow
for a 64-bit key-ID search.
When 32-bit key ID collisions occur, you may want your key server to
display a warning in the user-interface.
Remember that 32-bit collisions could be accidental, so not reporting them
would prevent the distribution of legitimate keys. (And you mention the
possibility of an intential DOS.)
I personally think that public key servers should do little more than
accept, store, and report data that it contains. Preventing the display of
keys with duplicate IDs steps over that line a bit too much for me.

I do like the idea of warning the user that multiple keys were returned,

I do think that understanding SHA-256 and SHA-512 is a good thing,
however. At some point, I expect DSS to be expanded to use larger key
sizes with the new hashes. It would be nice to have some support in the
existing versions.
I do really wish that PGP 5/OpenPGP had simply broken backwards
compatibility with them.

One of my complaints with GnuPG is the over-abundance of different ciphers
and hash algorithms to choose. Now, people are bandying about the idea of
including three new hashes (SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512) as options in
This would be a mistake, in my opinion. First of all, they are simply too
new to be trusted, and have not been vetted enough. Secondly, they get us
very little presently. When the DSS standard is updated to allow hashes
other than SHA-1, we may wish to revisit this, but until then I would not
use such keys.
Simplify. That is the key to having your crypto applications succeed.

@_author: Len Sassaman 
@_subject: Interoperability 
Correction: that should have read "One of my complaints about OpenPGP..."
This isn't by any means a GnuPG-specific problem. GnuPG implements nearly
all of the ciphers defined in OpenPGP (and I think perhaps it should be
more conservative in the ones it chooses), but the fact that they're
defined in the first place allows this to happen.
Another issue with having multiple hashes: because of the way OpenPGP
handles DSA signatures, if one supported hash is broken, all DSA
signatures will be breakable in PGP. (This has been discussed before on
the OpenPGP WG List) -- I'll dig up a cite if someone insists). Currently,
RIPEMD-160 and SHA-1 are in use, and an attacker would only have to break
*one* of those hash functions in order to break OpenPGP DSA signatures.
(While PGP doesn't generate RIPEMD-160, it does understand it).
Adding in the three new SHAs makes this problem even more likely to occur.
Tread carefully.

@_subject: Making it simple 
Let me make sure I understand:
1. You generated a keypair "A" using PGP 6.5.8, and sent the public key
A(pub) to your customer.
2. You generated a new keypair "B" using GnuPG.
3. Customer is encrypting messages to key A(pub), but you only have
"B(sec)" on your private key ring.
How do you expect to be able to decrypt those messages if you don't have
the secret key? Why did you generate new keys?
You need to either import your first key pair in GnuPG, including the
private key, or you need to send your customer the new public key
(This problem isn't about PGP/GnuPG compatibility at all).

@_subject: using a key without self-signature 
One may wish to generally not use un-selfsigned uids, but may wish to
specifically use certain keys which do not have a self-signature. Rather
than have to remember to type out allow-non-selfsigned-uid every single
time (which may not even be possible, if you are using a mail filter or
other wrapper), it would be nice to indicate that the key is acceptable in
some sort of semi-permanent fashion.
May I suggest that if a uid is signed (or lsigned) by an ultimately
trusted key, and there is no uid revocation, that it should be usable
without the allow-non-selfsigned-uid flag?
