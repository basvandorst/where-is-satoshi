@_subject: Not able to locate how keys are configured (GNUPG) 
============================== START ==============================
I am using this GNUPG tool on windows 2000 and I found that the keys are
located in the C drive in a folder but I am not able to find how these
keys are connected with the tool, and they have multiple keys in the C drive
in different folders.
I found that configuration file is also not there in GNU/GNUPG
can you please tell me where to check and what to do.
*I am new to this Tool*
Thanks & Regards
