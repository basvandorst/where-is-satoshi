Hi Marc,

This HOWTO covers Kernel 2.2. and international kernel patches.
I have heard, these kernel patches have become part of the main kernel
sources since there are new crypto polictics in US?
Is this correct?
Is the HOWTO aplicable to kernel 2.4.x?

@_subject: setting cipher-algo for encrypting to PGP 2.6.x user? 
i just realised that gpg uses 3DES symmetric encryption when using a
RSA pub key. I thought there was a way to tie a specific algo to a key but did not
find (--help, man gpg, faq, gph) a gpg command for it. I'm using mutt and do not want to change my gpg.rc but to edit this
one key.
What do i miss?

Hi there,

I tried very hard, read the FAQ and GPH but found no way to see this

until now i'm using gpg as a pgp2.6.3 replacement. My knowlegde about
how to use and what to avoid in using pgp 2.6 is fairly good (i think).
Now it comes to generating a new keypair (instead of my old pgp263
key) and im searching for advanced documentation about subkeys, key preferences, algorithms and the like.
Thanks for helping,

Because I want to use it with my standard gpg-mutt settings (as

Hi David et al.,

? In which circumstances could this happen?
My understanding is:
Somebody sends me her pub key.  She tells me (my gpg) via --edit
user-id setprefs which algos, hashes and compression she trusts
*and* her equipment is able to process.  With personal prefs i
(my gpg) select(s) a algo, hash and compression *i* trust (and my
equipment is able to process) from the set she send me with her
pub key.  Is this correct?

Hi Werner et al.,
* Werner Koch  [23. Sep. 2002]:
But that's what it behaves now:     I started gpg-agent via my .bash_profile as described in the
   documentation. Then i tried to sign a file.  First time nothing
   happend butt an error message stating it could not find pinentry.
   I made a link from pinentry to pinentry-gtk and tried again.     A "window" appeared at my console and i typed the passphrase.
   When i signed another file with the same key i gpg did it without
   asking me again.  *good*
   Then i startet X11 and a xterm and tried to sign a file with
   the same key. gpg did it without asking me.  *good*
!! Then in the same xterm i signed a file with a different key.
!! A few lines of text appeared:
!! "You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for..." on this
!! xterm.  Cursor is on the left.  It looks like a terminal prompt.
!! So i type my other passphrase --> it appears in clear text on the
!! terminal: everybody can read it.  *very bad*
   I went back to the console: there is an "window" asking me for
   the the second keys passphrase.  Normally i would take notwendig
   notice of this.
?? Then i played a bit with this console window.  At some point i
?? hit "TAB" and then i was asked: "Display all 1125 possibilities?
?? (y or n)". *?*
[newest versions og gpg, pinentry and newpg as of yesterday]
I would like to have a simple terminal interface for passphrases,
so i can use it in scripts.

Hi GnuPG users,

There are dozends of wars going on.  GnuPG is dual use technology: One can use military grade
encryption for planing massacres in any of these wars.  One
can use military grade encryption to protect human rights
initiatives or War Resisters International.
GnuPG and "PGP: public encryption for the masses" projects clearly
state their motivation rooted in civil rights movement.  So the
