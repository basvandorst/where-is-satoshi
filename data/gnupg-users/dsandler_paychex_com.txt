@_subject: Migrating GnuPG and EGD to another server 
I recently built EGD 0.8 and GnuPG 1.2.0 on a HP-UX 11.0 server.  I need
to migrate them to another HP-UX 11.0 server.  Can anyone point me to
documentation that would tell me which components need to be migrated,
and where they are located?

@_subject: How to resolve "mpi too large" error? 
I was trying to decrypt a file and received a "mpi too large" error.
Could anyone shed some light on this, and tell me how to resolve it?

I have a public and secret key pair that I generated, and I also have a public
key from another source which I imported and signed.  That is all.  The file
that I am trying to decrypt was encrypted by this other source.
I don't understand what a mantra is, but GnuPG is not asking for one.
I apologize if I am not being entirely clear.  I'm new to GnuPG.

I exported my public key and sent it to the other source.  He imported my public
key, signed it, encrypted a file with it, and sent the encrypted file to me.  This
was done at least two months ago.  Back then, I was able to successfully decrypt
the file with my secret key.  But I cannot do it today.  I have the same encrypted
file that was transmitted to me two months ago.  I also have the same key rings
that I used two months ago.
GnuPG needed to be rebuilt within the last two months on the server on which I am
working, and seems to have been rebuilt properly.  This is the first time I have
attempted to decrypt a file since GnuPG was rebuilt on this server.
Was there an option to not have a password on the secret key?  If so, we may have
chosen not to assign a password for this test.
