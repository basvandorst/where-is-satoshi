I'm currently promoting the use of GnuPG, but have a number of
problems doing so. My main reasons to promote GnuPG are that
it's both an open-sourced and also non-US encryption package,
that it builds on the PGP principles of working w/o a central
CA, and because it's able to incorporate newer encryption
algorithms and longer key lengths than Sphinx
(read "political decision").
- Problem  There appears to be no good Winblows interface for it,
  or at least no good way to hook it into Outlook, IE, Netscape there,
  what have you.
- Problem  It's dog slow. I have still less than 300 keys in my
  keyring (expecting to double that soon), and often find myself
  interrupting gpg to read the message instead of waiting to verify
  the signature. Similar things hold for signing or encrypting a
  message.
- Problem  I have adjusted gpg to fetch keys on demand from a
  keyserver. My experience is that these key servers apparently
  don't synchronize their data sets in a reasonable time frame
  (weeks!), so I end up fetching keys from varying servers. This
  is __very__ inconvenient, and of course unsuitable to the casual
  Winblows user. How do I go about this?
- Problem  What to do in the face of massive distribution and
  promotion of Sphinx which is also _not_ interoperable with any
  kind of PGP?
Please Cc me on answers since I'm not on the list. Thank you!

Hello Brian,
thanks for the answer.
I'm just testing out WinPT, but this is no real substitute for a
program that just places a new encryption button in the button bar
of your favourite program, eg. next to "print message", so users
have a minimal learning curve.
I should have been clearer, but I have almost no experience using
Winblows, but run almost exclusively on Linux and BSD for myself.
I'm talking about my Linux experience here, and about problems
I see when advising customers on how to go about encryption.
A friend of mine has to wait only a few seconds under Linux and with
PGP and with some 2k keys, but several minutes using gpg on the same
machine and only a few hundred keys. I have only 250-300 keys yet,
but - as said - expect that to double (triple?) very soon.
... using wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net which unfortunately has only a few of
the Debian keyring or other US-centric keys.
Sorry here ... I mixed it up again. The problem for me is only
general GPG/PGP usability here. I can expect the average Winblows
user to type in a passphrase _once_ a day, but can't expect them to
diagnose that a key server is hanging (and not their Exchange), and
how to adjust to another key server, or how to skip en/decryption.
I expected this, but in fact have seen keys not distributed across
them for some 2 months (which I almost equal to being non-functional).
Especially if you grok German there should be a good deal of
material, but there is also some English stuff (also advertised
on their homepage I'm still not on the list, please Cc me for answers. Thank you!
