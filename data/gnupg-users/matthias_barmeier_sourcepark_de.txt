@_subject: OpenGPG card indifferent places ? 
I have an OpenGPG card and created the keys on the card. Encryption and
signing works perfect with enigmail.
But when try to access encrypted mails with enigmail from my PC at home
enigmail that the secret key is not available.
The card reader is the same but how can I tell gpg that a key from the
card has to be added to my keyring ??
Could you help please ?

If I understand you correctly I only have to call something like gpg
--armor --export 0x123456 > key.pub
on my office PC and somthing like gpg --import key.pub is this correct ??
I tried to investigate what the URL should look like, but I cannot find
an example.
Could you give me some pointers or hints howto form this URL ?

I know this is asked a thousand times ... but it seems that everybody
that asked this question has found a personal solution to do it.
It would be great if I could get a step by step introduction on how to
set up a ssh login with a smartcard.
What works for me now is login via pam_poldi and signing/decrypting with
thunderbird and enigmail (thanx again to Sven and Werner to make the key
available at my home office).
gpg-agent is running with --enable-ssh-support but what is the next step ?
My old ssh keys works fine with gpg-agent but how do I add the key on
the card ?
Thanx in ad.

Strange ... this works at my office, but not at home ... I will check my
installation at home maybe something ist messed up. ssh-add -l does not
list the key on the card.
I will check  thanks for your help ... Is there a FAQ available ?? it
seems that the openPGP --> SSH stuff is interesting for a lot of people
and there are many legends out there.

If I succeed I could send me my debian howto that will be used in my
company if you like !?
But the problem at home persists. The setup looks good for me but
ssh-add -l only shows the ssh keys stored in .ssh not the one stored on
the chipcard.
The chipcard works fine for signing/encrypting and login via
libpam-poldi but the smartcard key does not show up.
What could I check to find the setup bug ?

No problem, suggest a license tyoe please because I am really
unexperienced with document licenses.
SOLVED !
I reinstalled the gpgsm package because my scdaemon.conf were missing,
and after this everything works.
Thanks a lot !
