@_subject: Quick --sign question 
If you sign a file using --sign
gpg --output doc.sig --sign doc
the docs say....
"The document is compressed before being signed, and the output is in
binary format."
This means that the output file doc.sig is compressed and signed.
This does _NOT_ mean it is encrypted...correct? --sign does not sign
and encrypt, right?
Also, what is the compression method?
