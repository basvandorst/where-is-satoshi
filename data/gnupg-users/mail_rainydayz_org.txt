Hash: SHA1
There is a nordic bank that generates s/mime certificates for its
customers. Because everybody has to have a registered address (at
least in Norway) they send a password to that address. You have to
present the certificate to login on the web.

The point being that you get a link. If the banks used PGP or S/MIME
then they could actually send you your statements.
