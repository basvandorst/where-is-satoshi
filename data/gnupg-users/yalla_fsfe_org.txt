How do you come to that figure? A keyspace of 1024 is the double
amount of 1023 bit, so I'm curious how you come to that figures.
It's one thing to brute-force 256-bit RSA in, let's say, a couple of
months, but a totally different to break 1024 bits.
As long as there ain't no really better algorithm to factor primes.

I'm not too familiar with prime- or number-theory. Does that scale in
the same factor in all keyspaces?
Thanks for sharing that. Not sure if I'll understand it, but I'll
definetly have a look at it.
However, the fact that primes get more rare when the keyspace is
expanded isn't necessarily connected to that point that you still need
to check the whole keyspace - which stills grows linearly?
In cleartest: Even if primes get more rare, you still need to find
your whole way through *all* numbers as long as you don't find a
better algorithm.

A P-problem? Really?! Factoring primes is a polynomal problem nowadays?
Are you SURE about that?
Or do you just mean that the current development in CPU-power
compensates the exponential nature to a linear one (in history)
because CPU-power became cheap and parallelization became more common,
reducing the complexity a bit? (although you can't reduce exponential
complexity to linear or even polynomal just *as is*)
That'd put RSA into deep trouble. And not only RSA.
I'm just realizing that I missed a lot in the last years. Must watch
the development more closely...

We already sorted that out in that other posting.

Hold on. Earlier you say "Factoring is known to be in NP". P is much
smaller. I'm not familiar to the latest outcomes. So what do you mean?
OK, there you got me. I only know the term context-free from languages.

Thanks. Though I must admit I must think about it before making a comment on it.
Was meant to be read as:
As you add a bit you double the keyspace, but you said something else
about it more below.
But you're argument that it "asymptotically grows better" worries me
when I think of my concept of asympotic - you mean, that the length of
the key and the probabilty of finding the factors converge?
Not really; if it scale exponentially, it wouldn't worry me.
That's what I meant.
Uh. Did I say this?
Yes, "doubles the keyspace"... Unlucky statement. Yet true?
Is that related to the approximated formular - density of primes - you
gave above?
Must think of it.
I read about it without further thinking about it.
Hey. I ain't no mathematician and last math-session at my Uni is years ago... :)
No, like in runtime, finding your way through the problem. But see below:
And that was my problem: You are absolutely right: I was implying
(wrongly) that finding a prime is in the same class as *factoring*
primes. Which is absolutely wrong.

I think we have a problem in nomenclature. Or, let's say, I have one.
Apparently P and NP doesn't mean the same to you and me.
Considering that my complexity-classes are years ago and you seem to
know what you're talking about, I just assume you're right.
However, that means that I have to rethink everything I think to know...
Which is not a bad thing at all :)
I still don't get what you mean with context-free in that context, but
I'll think about it.
If they're special primes, that's for sure. Proved a long time ago...
Right. But the p and q we use in RSA shouldn't be special :)
However. Since you just made me wonder about the meanings of P and NP,
I'll rethink and come back later.

@_subject: Strange decryption problem (block_filter read error) 
Hash: SHA1
Hi all,
I noticed a strange problem which occurred now three or maybe four
times, all under different circumstances.
I was using my Openpgp Smartcard to encrypt a file (size about 1.4 MB)
to someone else and to my key as well.
When I wanted to access the very same encrypted file to check if I was
able to decrypt it, I got this error:
gpg: block_filter 00B36A38: read error (size=9277,a->size=9277)
gpg: Problem reading source (16560 bytes remaining)
gpg: handle plaintext failed: file read error
gpg: mdc_packet with invalid encoding
gpg: decryption failed: invalid packet
gpg: block_filter: pending bytes!
It decrypted parts of the file, but stopped eventually, so the file
isn't completely decrypted.
I had the same problem with encrypted attachments I received from other
people who encrypted only against my public key. It's weird. However, I
also encrypted large files with success, so this is a sparse problem.
Does anyone have an idea what the problem could be? Is my smartcard
maybe borked?
Using gpg 1.4.7 on Windows, same problem occurs with gpg 1.4.6 on Linux.

@_subject: Simple beginners questions about the gpg-smartcard 
Hash: SHA1
Hi all,
I just subsribed to the list. I'm using the gpg-smartcard and it just
works for me.
However, I have a couple of maybe really simple questions which
weren't answered by the documentation I've read so far - yet.
1) Once I created my keypair on the smartcard and I was able to use it
on that system.
Now I bought several other smartcard-readers for my other machines and
I learned that I need to import the secret key (which I backuped
during the creation of the key on the card on the first system) on
every other machine which wants to use the smartcard too.
Why is that like that?
I thought that the secret key remains on the smartcard, and that this
is actually the benefit of the smartcard.
Why do I need to import the secret-key from disk to some local gpg to
that it can recognize the key on the smartcard at all?
I'm probably doing something wrong. Any pointers?
2) I bought a couple of SCM SPR-532 cardreaders. I learned that the
pin-pads are currently only experimentally supported by gpg
2.something. Is there any chance that the pin-pad support will be
backported to gpg 1.4.x?
Thanks a lot for your pointers & help. I probably just suck in reading
Cheers, Alex.

You'd need to take away write-rights from the directory where gpg.conf
resides - but that also would prevent the user of filling his or her
keyring. All those files are in ~/.gnupg after all...
You could probably put up all files in different directories and tell
gnupg to use the files from certain locations.
Or chown() the gnupg.conf to some other user. Not sure if gpg will read
the file then though.

Naaa, not really. You can do that with IMAP too, in Thunderbird for
example just do a right-click on the folder you want to have locally -
go to the offline-tab and check the "Select this folder for offline use
checkbox. Not a big deal. YMMV with other email-clients though.
Yeah, Google makes a difference between Inbox and "All Mail". They have
this enormous stupid claim:
"Messages sent to mailing lists don't show in my inbox
When you send a message to any mailing list you subscribe to, Gmail
automatically skips your inbox and archives the message to save you time
and prevent clutter. The message will appear in your inbox if someone
responds to it or if there is an error delivering the message. If you'd
like to view your message, you can find it in Sent Mail or All Mail."
Oh yeah baby, how convenient...
I don't know about POP3. But with IMAP you surely have that.
Yeah. Though since you can also use IMAP for offline use if you tell
your MUA to download the folders, it works just perfectly.
Apart from the fact that Google's IMAP-servers have been quite sluggly
the last couple of months...
