@_subject: No rule to make target `audit-events.h', needed by `all' 
Hi all,
I just tried to compile gpg 2.0.19 on Mac OSX. After resolving an odd issue
with libiconv, I got a little further, but get the following make error:
Making all in common
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `audit-events.h', needed by `all'.
 Stop.
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make: *** [all] Error 2
I found this question asked as far back as 2010 on various forums an user
groups, but I could never find an answer to what causes this and how to
resolve it.
Any hints?
