@_subject: HowTo?: 2048 bits DES key in GnuPG 1.0.6 ? 
I am looking for a patch for GnuPG 1.0.6 to generate at least 2048 bits
DES keys.
Due to the N^S^A is able to break 1024 bits and longer DES keys ...
Own to some e^s^p^i^o^n^a^g^e activities in the business field
it seems to be recommended to use respectively longer keys.
Any info, ideas or comments are welcome!
Thank you in adnvace.

what would be "the better" choice due to security issues?
GnuPG 1.0.6 or PGP 2.6.3i
