@_subject: simplifying the use of --throw-keyid option 
except for Disastry's versions of 2.6.3
no PGP version can either decrypt or generate a throw-keyid message
{have tried to beg for an implementation of this,
Disastry was the only one who listened}
a pgp user, who for whatever reason, isn't using gnupg,
might be able to work around it with a hex editor, and write a script
to insert the id's of his own keys, and let pgp try each one ...
but anyone capable of doing that, is probably already using gnupg ;-)

as people are importing 4k pgp dh and rsa v4 keys, if they have 5 secret
keys, the 'try all secrets' shuts off
[2] can there be an option where one can choose to have gnupg inform
the user if the passphrase is entered incorrectly for that key,
{especially useful for 'secure' passphrases, entered from the commandline,
 where mistyping may be common)
[3] can there be selective anonymity, where if encrypting to multiple
recipients, to specify the key-id for the throw keyid, and leave the
others intact,
(or, if easier to implement, an option for -ignore-throw-keyid

@_subject: simplifying the use of --throw-keyid option 
sorry for not articulating the request more clearly:
as the throw-keyid switch implemented now,(1.2.2), gnupg gives only one
chance per key to enter a passphrase
gnupg does not distinguish whether it is the correct key with an incorrectly
entered passphrase,
or a correctly entered passphrase, but not for the key it was encrypted
and after only one chance, without saying if the passphrase is incorrect
or not, goes on to the next key
so, if for example, i have three 'real' keys that i give out the public
key for {one v3, one v4rsa, and one dh, } each with a different passphrase,
then, i don't know if one my keys is the correct key, but i entered the
passphrase incorrectly, or if it is a passphrase encypted to someone else's key and not mine at
my request is:
can there be an option for gnupg to give an error message of 'incorrect
passphrase' for each key that it is checking when it tries all secrets,
and if incorrect, give addtional chances to enter it correctly, just
as it does when asking for asking for the passphrase for signing or encrypting

when gnupg armors a file using the '--enarmor' command, (gpg --enarmor filename)

this is also so from command line pgp,(pgp -a filename) both in  2.x and 6.x

@_subject: verification of clearsigned e-mails // question/request 
for verification of clearsigned messages, when there is a 'bad' signature,
would it be possible/feasible to have an option of '--try-all-unwraps',
(i.e, try 'unwrapping' the message, and re-attempt verification, assuming
a wrap setting of 60 characters/line, if still bad, then try 61, etc...
until a setting of 100 characters/line, (could be only from settings of  64 to 80, or whatever settings would be necessary to cover all the e-mail clients)
and if a 'good' signature is found after unwrapping at a particular wrap
setting, to list which wrap setting it was
the gpg output might look  something like this:
gpg: bad signature from key ID (key signed with)
gpg: try all unwraps? yes/no
gpg: good signature from key id when unwrapped at setting of 80 characters/line
or gpg: bad signature at all unwrap settings,  60-100 characters/line
this wouldn't help with mangled headers or extra dashes or other characters
that e-mail clients add,
but would solve the false 'bad' signature commonly resulting from different
wrap settings

there is a trivial workaround:
just import the secret key into pgp, which then automatically extracts
the public key, and then export the public key back to gnupg
(but the person asking has no interest in getting pgp, or is running
it on linux, etc.)
this came up on this list some time ago, and IIRC,
there was,(or was soon going to be), a way for gnupg also to extract
the public key given the secret key,
but i don't remember what the solution was ;-(

@_subject: feature request: allowing display of session key used for encryption 
would it be possible to have an option to allow for displaying the session
key that is being used during encryption?
(with the appropriate cautions about potential insecurity)
this would allow a sender who is encrypting only to the receiver's key,
to store the encrypted message, together with its session key
(the session key then encrypted to one of the sender's keys,
and saved together with a copy of the sent encrypted message)
this would allow for the sender to decrypt the sender's copy at a later
and allow for sender anonymity of the e-mail message in cases where the
receiver may prefer not to use the throw keyid option {i.e. with  pgp correspondents ;-)  }

@_subject: feature request: allowing display of session key used 
the --show-session-key works only upon decrypting
i'm asking for an extension of it,
 to also allow the session key to be displayed as it is being used to
definitely a great option,
have been trying for a long time to get pgp to use it,
even developed a workaround for having pgp users to be able to
decrypt throw keyid messages:
(but, for dh keys, it needs someone using gnupg to encrypt a message
first, and send the message to a pgp user to have a reference of the
the dh keyid)
so, meanwhile,
would still like to ask for the extension of the show session key feature
have to keep track of any session keys.
have been eagerly waiting for it's inclusion into the 1.2.x releases
but would 'still' like to request the extended show session key feature:
even using the throw key-id feature, it still shows that it was encrypted
to a second (or more) persons
with the extended show session key,
it can be encrypted to only the recipient,
and this provides a greater degree of anonymity and plausible deniability.

@_subject: known plain-text attacks 
not vulnerable,
attack unlikely
the basis for the attack using a session key as known plaintext,
is trying to solve the following problem:
given the public key, the plaintext(session key in this example), the ciphertext (packet of session key encrypted to public key),
can the private key be found ?
this has been well studied,
and cannot be done,
even using plaintexts of only one character,
and no salt or padding,
and getting repeated ciphertexts, encrypted asymmetrically directly to
the public key,
the private key still can't be recovered (for either the rsa or dh algorithm)
(but it is a very reasonable question,
and i still haven't seen the 'proof' that it *can't* be done,
only many assurances that it has been tried repeaedly without success.)

@_subject: armoring without encrypting or signing? 
is it possible to just armor a file without signing or encrypting,
as in the old pgp 2.x command: pgp -a filename.XXX  i had a situation where i needed to send a word document to someone who couldn't/didn't want to receive attachments,
so it was necessary to include the word.document as text within the message block
i tried:
gpg --armor d:\addend1.doc
and got the following error message:
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=00)
i was able to do:
pgp -a d:\addend1.doc
and got d:\addend1.asc
then did,
pgp -d d:\addend1.asc
and got d:\addend1 with pgp confirmation that the plaintext filename was
d:\addend1.doc ,
and then simply re-named d:\addend1 to d:\addend1.doc
and the word document opened successfully
i tried the same thing in gnupg using:
gpg -s --armor d:\addend1.doc
and got d:\addend1.asc but do not know how to restore the file from that, back into the original .doc format
is there a way to do this in gnupg?
{an equivalent to the pgp -d command, or any other way?
the person i need to send this to, uses gnupg but not pgp2.x
and even if he did, the entire message needs to be signed and then encrypted to his dh key}

[1] does this work for all versions of gnupg ?

where is it described? {could not find it in rfc 2440}
[1] could gnupg list the original filename extension after the dearmor

the file after dearmoring
{ok if not, as the sender can alert the receiver what it was and how to change it back}

@_subject: TAB at EOL (GPG and PGP interoperability) 
is it a 'bug' or a 'feature' ?  ;^)
it is sort-of improbable that the files Kurt was referring to just had
'tabs' added onto the end .
it is more likely that some of the plaintext was arranged in columns like:
and then, after pgp 'wrapping'(or e-mail wrapping), the character at the end of the line,
got transferred to the beginning of the next line, leaving a TAB to end the line, but not as intentional trailing space
it would seem reasonable to think about either preventing 'wrapping'
from doing this,
or allowing gnupg to accept it

@_subject: TAB at EOL (GPG and PGP interoperability) 
you're right.
neither pgp nor gnupg will wrap a line ending in a tab followed by a character, and leave an empty tab space,
but interestingly, they do treat 'tab's differently:
assuming that gnupg wraps a clearsigned message at 64 characters,
and pgp at 76 characters
consider a plaintext of the following 3 lines:
abcdefghi1abcdefghi2 ... abcdefghi9
a'TAB''TAB' ... 'TAB'b'TAB'c
the first line has 90 characters, and is meant as a reference line.
the second line is empty, to allow to see what is 'wrapped' from the clearsigning.
the third line is the 'test' line:
one character at the beginning, then tabs until position 81, with a character at position 81, then one more tab, and a character at position 89
when clearsigned by gnupg, the first line wraps as expected, with all the characters after the 64th, moved to the next line.
but the test line does not wrap at all, instead the tabs are 'compressed' and the three 'real' characters stay on the same line,
with the last character at the 47th position.
when clearsigned by pgp, again, the first line wraps, this time after the 76th character,
but the test line is *unchanged* no wrap, no compression, and is allowed to remain at the 89th position.
either way,
both gnupg and pgp each verify the clearsigned messages of the other,
which leaves a puzzling question:
why would the files Knut was referring to have a 'tab' at the end of a line?
{sorry for having mis-spelled the name in a previous post,
have been holding off on getting the 'glasses with the lines in them'
have since increased the text size in the reader ;^)   }

if you mean that neither pgp nor gnupg wrap a line that ends with a tab
followed by a character, this is true only for pgp, which, even though it wraps at 76,
will not wrap if there is a tab anywhere after position 76
for gnupg, as long as the position of wrapping will not result in a line ending with a tab, then it will wrap,
usually at position 64
{is it possible to change the position of the wrapping in gnupg
i.e. the length of the line ?}

you are right.
sorry  :(
was using the front ends for gnupg to sign, and both win pt and gpgshell wrap at position 64 by default
checking it in the command line with just the --clearsign command produced no wrapping.
but i still don't understand something:
if the plaintext line ends in a 'tab' and is clearsigned by gnupg,
the signature will be 'bad' if the 'tab' is deleted from the end of the line in the clearsigned text,
so is gnupg calculating the 'tab' in the hash, even if it is at the end of a line,
and if it is, then why not have both gnupg and pgp agree to calculate it in the same way?

the entire corporate issue, while it would bring open pgp into everyday
commercial practice, is fraught with practical difficulties that must
be given a great deal of thought before implementing:
[1] what happens when the person already has a sizeable amount of money
deposited, and then loses the key or passphrase, (and lost the backups too),
is there an alternate physical means of identification to restore account
[2] similarly, if the key gets compromised ,
(net-crackers that can have bank account access if they harvest keys
and passphrases, may then consider keys a priority target ...)
the key can be revoked, but how is the new account re-generated.
to tie it to the revoking key, is a possiblity, but one that opens new
security issues about protecting the revocation certificate
interesting to see what becomes of the idea...

@_subject: Corporate public key? 
[...] lol ;-)
yeah, but the *online* bank in question may not have one in a location
that is reachable quickly enough
still, it could be made to work ...
if the revocation certificate is generated at the time the account is
made, and the revocation certificate is armored-signed by the account-user's
key, and sent to the bank with the instruction that, in the event of
a key compromise, the bank should require an exact copy of the signed
revocation certificate in order to re-open the account.
a very nice, and possibly under-utilized, property of open pgp signed
messages, (and encrypted messages), is that the message block or signature
block is unique.
re-signing the same exact clear-text with the same exact key, even with
the computer altered time to match the time of the original signing,
will have an infinitesmal chance of matching the original signed message
block or signature block,
so even if the key becomes compromised and an attacker produces a new
revocation certificate, it cannot be used to re-access the account
the authentic user can print out the original signed revocation certificate,
 fax it to the bank, and then proceed to set-up a new replacement key
with a new certificate.
can be made to be do-able if the bank wants to trouble-shoot and set
it up, and the users agree to it ...

@_subject: Can you unlock sent messages ?? Somehow ?? 
maybe a question at the cryptographic level ;-)
ordinarily, we assume that there is one session key for the symmetrically
encrypted packet, simply because that is the most secure and straightforward
way to do the encryption
the question here is, what if someone intentionally wanted a symmetrically encrypted (larger,
 single) packet that would partially decrypt differently with 'different'
session keys,
i.e. one message and a null string with one session key, and a null string
and second message with the second session key
is it really 'impossible' to construct?
if it is done after the fact, it would need the crc mdc to be taken into
but if it can be done altogether, it would then not be difficult to modify
the user's individual copy of gnupg to construct such messages, while
still leaving the company/third party under the illusion that they have
the 'correct' message
{in any event, even if it 'could' be done, it would intuitively seem
to be 'detectable', as the symmetrically encrypted packet would be inappropriately
interesting though,  ;-)

@_subject: Self Decrypting Archives 
just curious,
other than making a .exe file of what would otherwise be batch files,
what does the pgp sda do differently?
it seems as if it would need just a watered-down binary for symmetric
decryption only
in your idea, wouldn't it also be possible to make a much smaller binary
for the same symmetric decryption, and send it as a batch file, with
the same instructions/caveats as for an sda,
i.e. "caution, this runs code on your computer, and is not a secure way
of doing things, but here is the encrypted file you asked for anyway"
a practical way that sda's are done 'sort-of' securely, for multiple
large files,
is that they are all written as sda's onto a cdrw, sent by certified
registered mail, and confirmed by phone by the receiver calling the sender
upon receipt of the packet.
the insecurity of the executable still does not compromise the secrecy
of the files, and it is a nice way to be able to send confidential correspondence to
those who are  reluctant to take the initial step into encryption .
eventually, as they appreciate the protected communication, and find
that they can't send confidential replies back,
then they might take the step, and no longer need it.
would it be so terrible to have gnupg make this available?
{it can even include a full rant in blinking yellow text on red background
about the insecure nature of the application ;-)}

even if you could get gnupg to ignore the missing self signature, and use the key anyway,
who would trust such a key for encrypted correspondence?
also, the fact that pgpdump does not recognize the key,
and both gnupg and pgpdump report the exact same errors for all the 'incomparable' keys, {a rather unusual error message, not encountered when ordinarily importing a public key} this *links* the keys to the same source
the concept you propose is interesting, and has usefulness,
but not in its present form
try re-doing it in a way that the keys can be imported and used without any special alerts, {the public keys anyway,}
and then re-posting it
my gut suspicion is that a packet link will be found when analyzing each public key thoroughly, and comparing them,
but, you never know... ;-)
good luck,

the idea is interesting enough to be taken to the 'next' stage of trial:
to try to produce these keys so that they can be used in gnupg, even if they need to be generated in a hacked version.
if they cannot be made to be used except in a hacked version, then they have only a very limited theoretical future

@_subject: Gnupg and hushmail 
hushmail has two very good uses:
[1] allowing encryption and verification of messages to people who do
not yet want to learn how to use gnupg or pgp,
but recognize the value of encryption and verification, as long as it
is a one time process (initiating the account and importing other hushmail
member keys)
people who use it for this function eventually learn that most people
using encryption don't use hushmail, and then consider going ahead with
a 'real' encryption program.
[2] privacy in terms of untraceability, but much faster than remailers
people who use it for this reason {like me},
but are perfectly happy to use gnupg ar pgp for the encryption and verification,
can easily use hushmail,
by just using hushmail as the e-mail carrier,
and checking the box in the upper right hand corner of the hushmail e-
mail viewer, that says: 'show actual message'
all gnupg, pgp, and pgp2.x encrypted messages easily decrypt when the
raw form is displayed, and there is no difference if mdc is used or not

@_subject: generating keys whose names begin with a digit instead of a letter 
i imported a keypair from pgp to gnupg,
the keyname began with a digit {263m63des}
everything worked fine, as expected.
when i tried to generate a key in gnupg, {ordinary dh key, nothing fancy}
and give it a name beginning with a digit, gnupg gave the following message:
Name may not start with a digit
if gnupg can easily import and use keys that are already named this way,
but won't let it be generated this way,
then is there a potential problem to watch out for, with any other gnupg
functions in using a key already named with a digit at the beginning?

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: RIPEMD160
consider the case of an anonymous user/poster on the net,
who consistently signs posts with a certain key
depending on the content of the posts,
whether accurate, informative, civil, or just plain interesting,
knowing that a post, article, or file, has been signed my that key,
can be useful in determining how to consider the information there. {ignore it as irrelevant,  downloading it and read it as an
informative resource, or just casually checking it because 'the
person who signs with that key usually has an interesting take on
things' }
it provides a very nice forum for an individual's ideas to be
considered on their objective merits, and to be able to build a
reputation based on those ideas, while still maintaining a comfortable barrier of anonymity,
between the person's interests and hobbies,
and the person's personal and professional life.
having your preferred key signed by other already 'well-known'
respected people in your area of interest, might be a simple
practical start ...

there may be a not-too-elegant ;-(  workaround :
first make all the non-v3 sigs 'local' trust only/ non-exportable,
then export the key
you still have to do the first part manually,
but you can save the useful v4 sigs for the gnupg keyring
you can import the key into command line pgp (6.5.8 or filecrypt)
and then try a script that will identify and delete v4 sigs, and use
it together with the command:
pgp -krs  keyring
(btw, filecrypt in free demo mode, allows the keyring editing functions)
probably much quicker and easier to just do it by hand ,  ;-)

sorry, i should have been clearer in the original post,
the point is, for messages where the sender doesn't want to encrypt to
self, (or even to an anonymous key) but is sending an encrypted message
encrypted to only one key (the receiver's),
since GnuPG obviously knows which session key it is using for the symmetric
encryption, and then is encrypting it to the receiver's key,
it seemed like it might not be too much extra work to have an option
to allow it to display the session key that it is using,
and then the sender could save it

@_subject: can you deny you sent a signed e-mail? 
it is more important for 'trust' than for 'legality'
if someone trusts you, and your ability to sign and encrypt, and safely
guard your key,
then he/she can can be reasonably certain that a message that verifies
with your signature, came from 'you', and not an mailicious impersonator
if someone 'doesn't' trust you,
then there is a 'notary' signature type
that is being worked on, that can be requested,
and can date and record a signature as being done at a certain time,
which would be hard to claim later that it was stolen/forged
if the signer admitted to using the key any time after the notarized
signature, before revoking it/reporting it stolen
(but who says that the 'notary' is trustworthy ... ?)
my grandmother used to say,
(back in the olden days when people were not in the habit of going to
"if you really know and trust someone,
you don't need the 'papers'
if you don't trust them,

@_subject: gpg: malformed CRC 
gnupg provides the best solution here, by allowing you to ignore it,
and go ahead and decrypt,
but still informing you of an alteration,
there are some (admittedly far-fetched) spoofs that are prevented by
having the checksum intact:
for example,
let's say that Alice and Bob are corresponding about sensitive issues,
that Alice does not want anyone to know about, especially Alice's problem
acquaintance, Charlie.
it is possible for a middleperson to get Alice upset and Bob in trouble,
by intercepting the message,
and adding another packet of a session key encrypted to Charlie's public
causing Alice to think that Bob simultaneously encrypted to Alice and
neither Bob nor Alice can prove that the packet with the session key
encrypted to Charlie's key, isn't the 'real' session key,
without being able to decrypt with Charlie's key.
this would be prevented by a crc and mdc authentication of the 'real'
message, and not allow any extra spoofing packets to be added.
using the 'ignore' options allows for the convenience in being able to
decrypt messages with simple benign e-mail mangling,
while still allowing for an 'alert' that the message was altered,
and leaving it up to the user to decide if further investigation is necessary,
(and if there are no 'unusual/unexpected' packets, then nothing further
is necessary)

@_subject: gpg: malformed CRC  //  feature request 
David Shaw dshaw at jabberwocky.com then i would like to request a feature to provide this type of protection
no new packet type need be involved,
it could work something like this:
[1] once a gnupg command of sign and encrypt is entered,
the session key for the encrytion should be generated first,
and encrypted to the public keys of all the recipients
[2] all the other packets (except for the signed and encrypted message)
could then be generated
[3] after all the other packets are generated,
gnupg could prompt the user with the following:
gpg: the following packets are included in your pgp message:
(here it would list each type of packet, including the public keys the
session key is encrypted to),
gpg: would you like a hash of these packets added to the end of the plaintext
of your message , y/n?
[4] answering 'no', would proceed as gnupg ordinarily proceeds, with
no hash done, and nothing different included
answering 'yes' would add the hash after the last line of the plaintext,
possibly as follows:
the following line is a hash of the above listed pgp packets included
in this message, in order to verify their integrity after the message
has been decrypted
(hash listed)
[5] the plaintext plus hash is signed, and then encrypted with the session
key, added to the other packets, crc and mdc, and sent.
[6] the crc and mdc still are there for e-mail-mangling alerts,
and, after decryption and verification, the hash can be used to verify
the packets and detect any packet 'additions/deletions'
no new packet is introduced that would require rfc 2440 changes,
and the hash can still be verified by non-gnupg implementations.
(it can also allow for an option to include a verbose listing of each
of the packets, and effectively solve any surreptitious forwarding issues,
 and detect separations of signed and encrypted messages into clearsigned
(Please, Please ;-) )

this is not really the main cause; GnuPG does not default to AES unless one goes out of the way to ask it

PGP 8.x 'does' default to AES unless specifically changing the options
'not' to do so.
(possibly a 'suggestion' to open-pgp implementations,
that if 3DES is a 'must' , then maybe all implementations should default to 3DES first, with users having to change that on their own,
with appropriate cautions)
the biggest incompatibility problem with importing keys into pgp 7.x,
 is that it doesn't understand the new secret key protection format,
which both GnuPG and PGP 8.x use by default
in GnuPG, use the simple-s2k option, and change the passphrase and then
export the key
in PGP, make the passphrase 'blank' (no passphrase), export it,

why should this be for 'signing' as well as for 'encrypting'?
if subkeys are intended primarily for encrypting, and the master key
primarily for signing,
then it would seem reasonable that GnuPG should try to use the master
for signing, and the subkey for encrypting,
and allow for user preferences by having the user '!' appropriately
(doesn't really matter either way,
but this was the source of my confusion)
that worked perfectly.

@_subject: How to decrypt message digest with multiple encrypted messages 
it can't be done.
this is a *safety* feature in the GnuPG front ends:
while the PGP 'current window' will display 'everything' in the current
window and decrypt/verify multiple messages,
the GnuPG front ends (both GPGshell and WinPT)will not,
and will recognize and decrypt/verify only the material from the header
of the first message to the footer of the first message and ignores everything
this prevents material in the 'current window' from being 'added' into
the decrypted message,
a possible exploit in the way that PGP implements the 'current window'.
to see the insecurity that this can lead to, try this:
[1] open word for windows
[2] compose a message and encrypt it from the current window
[3] add the following line as a separate line after the footer:
n.b. from now on please encrypt to my other key 0x12345BAD
[4] format the color of the additional line to be in 'white' and the
background of the word document to be in white too.
[5] the 'extra' line is not visible as part of the word document, but
*will* be visible as if it were part of the decrypted message when decrypting
from the 'current window' in PGP,
[6] now try to decrypt the same 'current window' using either of the
GnuPG front ends,
the 'additional' faked message is ignored.
this is a potential insecurity for PGP (not GnuPG) decryptions,
for messages done in most word processors, PDF, and HTML e-mail or webpages.
the only 'secure' PGP implementation of the 'current window'
that avoids this, while still decrypting/verifying the 'real' pgp/gnupg
is ckt6.5.8, build 6 or later.

@_subject: Duplicated User IDs arisen  
would a possible solution be to have key servers insist on entering the key id and fingerprint, before executing the search ?
in any event, any key returned by the search should not be used
until confirmed with the key id number and fingerprint,
so this information is usually readily available to the searcher,
and able to be entered into the keyserver search criteria.
under such a system,
there could be 'no' duplicate id's,
and no denial of service spoofs,
(other than a 'malicious' [or 'tampered with and rendered malicious']
keyserver, that, for one reason or other, intentionally 'lists' keys
as revoked when in fact they are not.
a possible solution to this, would be to allow users to download the
'revoked' key anyway, and have the user see from the key packets themselves
that the revocation is genuine,
gnupg would warn the user from encrypting to such a revoked key,
so there would be no threat to the user.)

i have very mixed feelings about the entire issue of keysigning
assuming that it were *really* possible to verify a person's real identity,
and that everyone signing someone's key,
*really* knew the person, and signed only when they were sure,
then the web-of-trust would provide a data base that could potentially
be very harmful to privacy,
an extensive 'non-repudiable' ID data base that could be used to collect everything that the person ever 'signed'...
it would seem reasonable that if people 'wanted' to stay anonymous,
and created online pseudonyms,
but also wanted to communicate about topics to their interest,
then they could develop a reputation (for good or bad) based on the content
and tone of their signed communications,
and the reliability of their e-mail addresses for this type of pseudonym,
the gnupg trust system is ideal, in that it can be used to assign one
of the 'lower' non-exportable trust levels, indicating something like:

then, when the command line says:
then gpg, and all other commands will work
(this is the same way that pgp2.x is still run from a floppy on windows without installing it into the path)
a kind linux user (who occasionally posts to this list too),
also developed a way to run gnupg from a floppy without any registry entries:
but it requires a windows file 'cmd.exe' for the floppy
since this file is already on windows systems,
it 'might' be possible to set up gnupg on windows without involving registry entries,

trust only 2.6.3,
is that it is the only one that they personally have gone over the source code
gnupg, which almost everyone agrees is much better and more secure
than any other pgp implementation,
{+/- elgamal signing issues),
has a source code at least an order of magnitude larger than Disastry's 2.6.3,
and if the cryptographers haven't been with gnupg since the beginning and gone over each of the diffs,
it is too much to check all at once now
with regard to the wipe function in 2.6.x,
it is not as good as Eraser,

@_subject: Weakness in SHA-1 
]While this isn't a practical break of MD5, it is still prudent to stop
]using it.  In the context of OpenPGP, stopping using MD5 means
]stopping using v3 keys.  If we stop using MD5 today, we can gracefully
]migrate to something better.  If we wait until there IS a practical
]break, then we are forced into a frantic repair mode that can cause
]other harm.
]If there
]is a rational argument for starting a transition away from SHA-1, then
]we sure as heck should have been off MD5 for a long time now.
md5 is not necessary for signing with a v3 key,
and certainly not for encrypting
v3 keys can sign with 'any' hash,
but practically, for the purposes under discussion,
v3's can use sha256
dh/dsa cannot use anything higher than 160
(and, as i actually 'do' have a dh/dsa key, even if i don't use it much
;-) ,
i am just as concerned with the sha weakness for my dh/dsa key, as with md5 for my v3 key)
if dh/dsa can be modified to accept greater than 160 size and use sha
256, great,
if not,
then it might be prudent to look into a new hash design that would be
non md5/non sha-1 based
that would still allow dh/dsa signing at the 160 level
it is important to provide input into such a 'design contest' now,
that it provide backward compatibility, and allow for an sha 160 length
so that dh/dsa will still be used by those that prefer them,
when the attacks 'do' get better.
without such input,
the design contests may just take an easier way out by using a 'bigger'
hash, but not necessarily a more secure design,
and, even those candidates that do focus on the design, may want to present
the larger hash to make it the same as the competitors.
in the interests of compatiblitly,
it would be helpful if the respected people in gnupg and open-pgp
try to suggest that all entires for the hash be compatible with dh/dsa
160 length, 'before' any such contest begins.

@_subject: deluid  // follow-up 
after looking at the deluid some more,
found that any user's uid can be deleted from the public key,
and that this appears to be open-pgp behavior
this can be useful when someone has many outdated uid's,
and the user wants only the one with the current  'real' e-mail and wants to delete all the other ones
this could lead to some abuse,
since a user could intentionally delete the 'real' uid from someone's public key, leave an outdated one,
and either publicly post the key , or upload that key to a new keyserver that did not have it before,
and an unsuspecting user, verifying that key with its signatures and fingerprint,
receives misleading information about the key
wouldn't it be better
where the deluid could be 'local only/non-exportable'
for user convenience,
but would require a key-owner to make deletions
(obviously cannot be implemented retro-actively,
but maybe whenever the keyserver system is modified,
it might be another issue to consider)

] Named Attribute Subpacket (type 100)
] Datatypes:
    0 - reserved
    1 - no data (it is just named flag)
    2 - boolean
    3 - integer

    100-110 - private or experimental use
] NB: Binary type holds just some unspecified binary data. ] On the other hand, binary file type holds file that can ] be saved to disk and the name ] of the attribute represents its filename.
doesn't this pose some risk of exploit ?
suppose someone wants to put a malicious executable
as part of the packet,
and gives it some interesting name,
sends a pgp signed e-mail or posts a clearsigned message,
and gets people to download the key from a keyserver
to verify the signature
is there anything in gnupg that would prevent the running of the (i.e. is the key just 'ignored' or 'refused'
as 'key with unsupported packet type' ?
and can this protect against some type of malware corrupting the just by getting gnupg to 'check' the packet ?)

those close to her did not have time to post to the public

her site is still up:

she was a journalist who worked with people who needed to
use gnupg without having it installed, or using it,
and put together a very useful 'gpg-2-go'
that could fit on a floppy, and when on a usb drive, could fit
with all the documentation and keyserver functions that gnupg full editions have
i believe that she would have wanted it to be continued
and maintained,
and a most fitting and dignified way,
would be to have it in some way, as part of the gnupg homepage...
have communicated with page's co-author John W. Moore III
who agreed that she would have wanted this
her page has the GPL copyright
John and i, and whoever else maight be interested, are willing to update it with newer editions of gnupg as they are available,
and also with winpt when available as registry-read-only
if, for whatevwer reason,
it is not feasible to incorporate her page into gnupg's home page

@_subject: GPG for windows 
the most recent winpt's have not been there for some time now,
they are on Timo's site here:
while i agree with you that gpgshell has a 'smooth' PGP feel to it,
if the last time you checked winpt was from the sourceforge site,
you might consider looking at it again from the other link
new advantages:
(1) complete installer package, so that gnupg new users don't need to play with registry settings
[caveat: this makes it harder to install gpgshell afterwards, as there are some windows path details that gpgshell is fussy about,
if you already have gpgshell installed, just install winpt without the gnupg installer]
(2) ability to see all keys and keyid's that the message is encrypted to, directly from the decryption window
[gpgshell either just gives a passphrase entry window if you want to see the passphrase as you are typing it, but doesn't tell you which 'keyid' or even which key it is for,
or it gives you the gnupg command line interface to enter the also, winpt does not require the passphrase to be cached, in order to let you see the passphrase as you are typing it in,
and allows this for 'all' gnupg functions;
key generation passwords, key editing password changing, signing a key, etc. (3) ability to choose between the primary signing key, and the signing subkey
[gpgshell uses the gnupg default of using the latest signing subkey for signing, regardless of clicking on the 'primary' signing key]
(4) the key editing functions are all selectable in the key editing [gpgshell key editing just transfers you to the gnupg command line key editing interface]
(5) winpt provides 'wiping' to the same standards as eraser
(DoD or Gutmann settings)
smart card and encrypted disc containers (similar to pgpdisk and scramdisc) will be added in future versions
i would suggest trying 'both' gpgshell and winpt
and let users decide which they are happier with,
they can always keep 'both' and switch back and forth for whatever they find more convenient

it would be very convenient to be able to start gnupg , decrypt symmetrically, and then continue
as it is now,
the workaround is not too bad,
to have a backup 'dummy' secring.gpg, and trustdb in gnupg,
and replace them each time with the symmetrically decrypted ones,
and then wipe/secure-erase the decrypted 'real'secring.gpg when (still, it is a little tedious,)
as there is no security problem in having gnupg be able to symmetrically encrypt and decrypt without keyrings present,
then could this be considered as a possible future feature?

during key generation, gnupg asks if the user wants to enter a comment: (please, local signature only)
having this type of comment might alert people not to sign the key,
and decrease people's reluctance on having their keys on a server
(the ideal keyserver situation would be to allow only the key owner to upload his/her key to a keyserver, and to obtain whatever signatures desired on that key, directly from the signers, and then upload it)

any ideas on how this could be done?

(i have not tried using the one from xp on any other windows once these are gotten,
[1] unzip winpt into the root usb directory [2] copy the shell32.dll into the same usb root directory where winpt [3] in gpg.conf,
change the home directory drive letter from A:\
to the letter of the usb drive
(n.b. this will often change from computer to computer, depending on how many cd, dvd, zip, or other drives are already present,)
[4] double-click on the 'go.bat' file in gpg-2-go,
and a dos window should open,
gpg -h
and confirm that gnupg is running
[5] double-click on the WinPT.exe file
winpt will give several error message alerts as it looks for the and other gnupg files,
then it will ask for their locations,
and a winpt 'gpg preferences' window will open,
asking for the locations of the gnupg home directory,
gpg.conf, gpg.exe, and locale directory
(again, these may need to be changed when the usb drive letter changes when moving from host to host)
once these are entered,
just double-click again on WinPT.exe
and the keys will load, and the familiar winpt key icon will be in the right-hand side of the windows tray toolbar
and then, all winpt functions work,
including wipe original, wipe files, and wipe free-space
(the one thing that may not work is the keyserver access,
if the host system allows only http and no non-browser internet access)
minor interesting tweak: if the public host computer doesn't allow a usb key attachment,
and allows only front-loading usb connectors of different types,
then the entire above setup can easily be stored on a 16 meg memory card of a digital camera (with enough room left over for a few pictures ;-)  ),
and gpg-2go + winpt can be run by connecting the camera usb port, and accessing the drive the same way as any other connected usb drive
using winpt this way, in addition to providing a comfortable gui,
also provides an 'eraser'-type wipe function,
(DoD or Gutmann settings) that isn't available in the gnupg command-line

@_subject: gpg-2-go  +  winpt  +  usb drive   //   do-able  
you are probably right ;-(
i tested it on a neutral public system [win2k pro], that (afaik), has never had gnupg or winpt before.
(not especially a 'spying' system, but also one with no rights for me to install anything)
gpg-2-go + winpt worked fine from the usb port, as described in the original post,
i had no rights to edit the registry,
so i couldn't see what things winpt added
just by double-clicking WinPT.exe
when you re-booted on your test system after you removed the registry winpt additions,
did winpt just 're-add' them and work again?
i guess it should *not* be used for the 'without-a-trace' needs that gpg-2-go can be used for,
but does allow for a portable gnupg with front-end
for those who want it for a public cafe setting,
and are not concerned with winpt registry traces on the host system
key-logger / screen capture issues still apply)

(i.e. the 'plausible deniability' is *not* reliable)
i posted here recommending truecrypt
for 'plausibile deniability'
so, to anyone who may have used or is thinking about using,
truecrypt for plausible deniability,
here is the description of the problems found
(from a thread on sci.crypt)
there is no evidence of insecurity of the 'container' itself
and no attack on recovery of any files form within the container
the attack is only on the detectability of the 'hidden volume'
(also, it may be 'fixable' in an newer version)

@_subject: Disk Partition 
i don't know about cross-crypt,
but do have experience with truecrypt,
and must say that am surprisingly quite fond of it 'plausible deniability', is explained in the truecrypt faq,
and is accomplished by using a 'hidden volume' within the
truecrypt container
[1] let the hidden volume be less than 10% of the total container [2] do not use more than one truecrypt volume
(unless you have your own very convincing reasons why you need more than one ;-)  )
[3]partially fill the truecrypt volume with mildly personal/private (not really 'secrets', but things that are plausible to want to have encrypted, and which you would not mind releasing to the i.e. your medical history [the authorities can get it anyway ;-) ]
[4] keep the 'real' secrets in the hidden volume
[5] the unused space in the truecrypt volume when the volume is not mounted, has the same level of random data as when there is no hidden volume, so the presence of a hidden volume is plausibly and the reason for wanting the other things in the truecrypt volume encrypted is satisfactorily explained
if the truecrypt developers changed their license conditions to comply with GPL,
and only 'requested'
that programs that used true-crypt source-code,
forwarded a report to them
(not an unreasonable courtesy),
would that be enough to consider use of true-crypt as part of gnupg the only things missing from true-crypt are:
smart card support,
the ability to encrypt to a key,
authentication with a key,
this could easily be integrated into a gnupg-truecrypt combination
(possibly without using serpent, or multiple encryption sequences)
without any changes in the algorithms in gnupg/open pgp

what key are you encrypting to?
if you are encrypting to your friend's gnupg generated public key,
then, there is one simple step he needs to do when he receives your inline encrypted mussage:
hushmail will give an error message that it cannot decrypt
(because it doesn't have the private key of the gnupg generated [which is the way it should be, the private key shouldn't really be entrusted to anyone else, even hushmail ;-)  ]
when hushmail gives this error message, just click on 'options' in the hushmail e-mail message window, then on 'show original', and hushmail will display your encrypted message, which he can then decrypt in gnupg
if your friend has 'only' hushmail,
and doesn't use gnupg,
and wants to decrypt your messages,
then you need his hushmail public key,
(which either he needs to send to you, or, if you have a hushmail account too, you can retrieve it from 'hushtools' 'key management'
'retrieve a public key')
import your friend's hush key into gnupg, encrypt to it,
and then he will be able to decrypt the message directly

have been trying to decrypt a message using the session key,

here is part of the gpg output after decryption:

first, this one:

gpg --override-session-key string`2:1568A79A26ABCB75C294AA07AB73C53A7D168F2B898F93BE' then i tried it with a space between the word string and the session key string, like this: (there was no line wrapping in the command line)
gpg --override-session-key string `2:1568A79A26ABCB75C294AA07AB73C53A7D168F2B898F93BE' c:\r\s.txt

and got the same syntax error mesage for each of the variants of the session key string, both with and without the 2 and : in front, and both with and without the ' before and after the string
what is the correct syntax to get this to work?

[2]those wishing to have their sent mail stored encrypted,
can forward the sent mail to to self,
(as this is not usually done, it must be implemented to 'allow' it,
but that shouldn't be that hard to do),
and encrypt the forwarded mail with the sender's default key
[3] add something in the subject line like:
'forwarded mail of 'date', encrypted'
[4] add a disclaimer that users choosing to save mail in the 'sent' folder without encrypting it, will have it stored as cleartext on the server
this keeps the users informed, gives them a choice,
allows them to be protected (and does so by default)

@_subject: gnupg clearsigning question 
is it possible to construct a gnupg signature that is the same each for the same file (and same signing key and hash ) ?
would like to do something like this for use as a truecrypt keyfile:
the truecrypt volume is on a usb drive,
the outer volume would contain the gnupg keyrings,
the rest of the usb drive contains miscellenaous files,
one of these is used for a keyfile for the outer volume,
what i would like to do,
is clearsign one of the many textfiles on the usb,
and use that clearsigned textfile as a keyfile for the hidden volume
the problem is,
that this changes each time it is signed ;-(((
is the only reason it changes because of the timestamp?
(and then would just resetting the computer clock to time time of the original signing work?
assuming it would be set to a minute or so before, and signed repeatedly until the timestamp was right to the second)
if the timestamp is the only thing making the signature different,
would it be possible to request a feature option where the timestamp is omitted?
(this wouldn't affect open-pgp compatibility)

@_subject: gnupg clearsigning question 
this might be very useful, and work out better without any special features
the issue is the 'keyfile'
keyfiles are problematic, in that they have to be stored and if an attacker gets the storage media where it is stored,
then measures must be taken to prevent recovery of the keyfile by the attacker
there are four general ways to do this:
(1) the simplest:
just encrypt the keyfile, and decrypt it when necessary
(the problem is that this calls attention to itself, by having an encrypted file present, and authorities can demand the key, or the session key, and recover the file)
(2) the most secure, (but most tedious):
have a folder of 7776 small textfiles, each having a diceware word as one of the filenames,
and select a group of keyfiles the same way that a diceware passphrase is selected
(the problem here is, that truecrypt keyfile selection does not behave like word selection in a passphrase,
since the order of selection of keyfiles is not important,
and a keyfile cannot be used more than once,
so, while a passphrase of 'r' diceware words has a complexity of a similarlry constructed selection of keyfiles,
has a complexity of only (7776 C r)  =  [(7776!) / (r!)([7776-r]!) ]
(btw, anyone want to provide a table of how many more keyfiles are necessary for equivalent complexity?
i.e.  to achieve a complexity of a 6, 10, or 20 diceware word passphrase, how many diceware keyfiles would be necessary?)
(3)the gnupg signing way,
ideal, in that the keyfile is not present anywhere,
and cannot be constructed by anyone without the secret key,
and even if that is given up, the exact correct time needs to be (4) the workaround i use now, (i think it's reasonably ok,
[electron microscopy file recovery is not in my threat model ;-)], but i invite comments/criticism/suggestions):
create a textfile by copying a selected part of the gnupg manpage,
(present on the usb drive together with a gpg2go setup)
and then typing in a diceware passphrase on a separate line,
and using the resultant textfile as the keyfile,
and wiping it after use

there is a simpler way,
just add the following line to the end your message,
before signing:
"this signed and encrypted message,
is intended for, and being encrypted to,
the following key(s):
(list user id's and fingerprints)"
this will be unqusetioned by all the recipients you really intended to encrypt to,
it doesn't deal with a potentially more difficult situation :
proving you signed something,
to someone whom you would prefer it 'not' proved to  ;-((
if one of your recipients later has a disagreement with you,
and wants to harm you by 'leaking/publicly posting' this material,
then any message that you sign and encrypt,
can be posted as a verifiable free-standing clearsigned or armored-signed text
the only way around this is to develop a type of 'deniable signature'
(i.e. the person you sent it to, knows you really signed it,
but can't prove it to anyone else)
once the open-pgp workgroup is ready to start with new ideas for the next rfc revision,
there can be some agreement about this signature type
(there have been several interesting proposals)
for now,
one of the ways of doing this (in pgp)
is to use a split-key/shared-key system,
a new key is 'split' to 2 or more public keys,
and signing privileges are set to '1' share
(signing privileges [and decrypting privileges]
can be set for 1 share, all shares, or any number in between, so that it is possible to require the co-operation of 'all' sharers
to sign or decrypt)
when signing privileges are set to 1,
then 'any' of the sharers 'could have' signed it,
while all of them know who 'really' signed it, --the one who 'sent' it
(this is especially true when there are only 2 sharers,
since the receiver knows that the receiver 'didn't' sign it)
posting it as a free-standing clearsigned message,
or re-encrypting and sending it to someone else,
still leaves the true signer's identity unprovable
again :-)

ok, Thanks!
this is very helpful,
then the problem is not gnupg, only me ;-)
(much easier for me to try to debug my setup ;-) )
tested on cygwin, and also from gnupg mingw32 pre-compiled binary at the windows command prompt
results identical,
but *did* find, and workaround the problem
the problem was that my gpg.conf had these options:
cipher-algo twofish
digest-algo SHA256
s2k-cipher-algo twofish
s2k-digest-algo SHA256
( i put them in because i didn't want new keys to be self-signed sha-1, and because i prefer twofish)
once these were # commented out,
the file decrypted perfectly with the following gnupg command:
gpg --pgp2 --decrypt filename
when Disastry's build is configured intentionally to used twofish and sha-256
then there is nothing i can tweak in gnupg to get it to decrypt ;-((
here is the file:
the pgp command to generate this was:
pgp -cat filename -jtju
if anyone has any ideas on how to decrypt this in gnupg,
please post,
( i don't consider this a 'problem' in gnupg,
and, fwiw, it doesn't decrypt in pgp 9 either, or even in ckt builds,
pgp 2.x users are quite happy to communicate only with other pgp 2.x users
and don't really need gnupg to try to cover all possiblities to remain compatible
(although it *is* compatible with 'ordinary' (classic) pgp 2.x
as long as the above listed option types are not used during decryption attempts,)
it is also of some interest ;-)
that users of Disastry's version
may have found a simple way to communicate symmetrically,
so that even if someone 'overhears' the passphrase,
they will still be unable to decrypt unless they use Disastry's and will more likely think,

@_subject: GPG and PGP Compatibility (Conan Purves) 
using gpg4win, there is a workaround to avoid attachments but still sign the file and send it as part of the the inline message, and it works for any file type:
[1]use windows explorer to find the file you wish to send as an attachment, and right-click on the file
[2]click on 'gpgee' and then on 'sign'
[3]in the gpgee signing window,
(a) in the left pane, (entitled 'Signature Options'),
click 'Attached'
(b) in the right pane, (entitled 'Misc. Options'),
click on 'Text Output(ASCII Armor)'
[4]select your signing key and sign the file,
gpgee produces an ascii armored output 'file.asc' and saves it in the same directory as the original file
[5] use notepad to open the file, but make sure that in the notepad bottom box entitled 'File Type',  'All Files' are checked,
(the default is 'Text documents', and notepad will list only .txt files and not 'see' anything else)
[6] copy the armored text and paste it into the body of the with an instruction for the receiver to save it as 'file.asc'
[7] open file.asc using winpt's file manager,
it will verify the signature and save the original file type
(do 'not' try to verify it from the 'current window', as it will only verify the signature but not recover the file)
[8] the same will happen in all pgp versions through 8.x,
if they save the file as file.asc, and verify it using 'PGP Tools' or 'PGPMail'
(i haven't tried PGP 9.x since the first time it came out,
so you might need someone to test it for you using the current 9.x)
this works with any type of e-mail client,
and the entire message can be sent as signed and encrypted,
without any indication that an attachment is included
(although people might guess because of the message size ;-)  )

(and yes, i agree that the proper place would be the ietf wg
but they are currently involved in trying to get the rfc revision and might not want to consider other issues at this time)
just wanted to point out that the 'comment' line doesn't need to have the word 'Comment:', it only needs to have a ':' so the following can be inserted instead of or in addition to,
the 'comment' and 'version' lines,
GNUPG WARNING: This signing key has been reported to be compromised
the signature would still verify,
but this could potentially be misleading to people just starting out with gnupg
even though it is not strictly necessary,
it would certainly be helpful,
if a short statement could be included into the gnupg documentation
saying something like:
" In a clearsigned message, the only part that is authenticated is the text of the message. This is the part in between the dashed lines,
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
Any insertions between the line,
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
and the signature block itself, is *NOT* authenticated, and may be altered without affecting the If there is any question about such insertions, please check them with the sender. "
the above is only a 'suggested text',
and could probably be improved on,
because of backward compatibility,
it is unlikely that the comment/version/ etc. lines could now be changed to be part of the authenticated material,
so the most practical thing might be just a small explanatory note in the user manual.

@_subject: Quantum computing (Robert J. Hansen) 
am not familiar with quantum physics,
but do have some math background
please confirm if i have understood your post correctly to imply
that if someone uses a straight diceware passphrase
(choosing words as they appear in the diceware list without so that a brute force dictionary attack using a diceware word list is possible) to protect a message encrypted symmetrically with a 256 bit algorithm,
then quantum computing could crack the passphrase even if it of 10 diceware words,
and that in order to achieve passphrase security at the 128 bit a 20 word diceware passphrase would be necessary ?
=====[begin background calculations]===== a diceware word list has 7776 possiblities,
7776 = 6^5  (5 dicethrows, 6 possibilities each)
7776 = [(2)(3)]^5
2^(1.58) < 3 < 2^(1.59)
(2)(3) = (2)(2^[1.58]) = 2^[2.58]
(7776) = [(2)(3)]^5 = [2^(2.58)]^5 = 2^(12.9)
to find the number of diceware words that would provide equivalent security to a 128 or 256 bit symmetrical algorithm,
we do
(7776)^x = 2^128   and  (7776)^y = 2^256
which becomes
2^[(12.9)x] = 2^128  and  2^[(12.9)y] = 2^256
so the closest integral values for x and y are 10 and 20 (whether the 1.58 or 1.59 exponents are used)
=====[end background calculations]=====
back to the quantum issue,
does this mean that if quantum computing ever becomes functional
to where a 128 bit symmetrical cipher is feasibly attackable,
then symmetrically encrypted messages, sda's, etc. using 10 diceware words or less,
are similarly attackable?

then the message will be signed but also symmetrically encrypted with the same passphrase (the passphrase for the signing key)

gpg: RSA/SHA256 signature From: aaaa1 at key.test ("F9015496 aaaa1)"
this message decrypts with the passphrase aaaa1, but not with the passphrase sss
if the second passphrase is the symmetric encryption passphrase,
then gnupg will abort
c:\gnupg>gpg --armor --passphrase aaaa1 -u aaaa1 -s -c --passphrase sss c:\1.txt

pgp gets 'more accepting' with every version, not less,

if this workaround 'does work'
then try it again with the linux and unix versions you used
a simple test would be to use a textfile of one line:
12345 followed by 5 blank spaces
check the size of the original textfile, and then
the size of 'saved form' of the armored signed text once it is and saved as plaintext
if the sizes are the same, the blank spaces have been kept
(this can then be confirmed by copying test line and pasting it into a new textfile consisting of only one character, making sure to paste it 'in front' of the character,
the resulting line will have the same number of blank spaces in front of the single character, as in the original file)

@_subject: gnupg for file splitting and re-constituting 
if someone has a large program, or file, (*any* file type)
and wants to split it,
send the fragments and reconstitute it,
it is a trivial (although minorly tedious) thing to do using gnupg
All that is necessary is to armor the program,
and then split the resulting textfile into smaller parts of suitable message size,
and send it as numbered inline e-mail texts,
and then concatenate the texts of all the fragments,
and then restore the program by de-armoring it. have put up an example of a 2.5 mb truecrypt container, containing two files, where the truecrypt container was armored signed and and the armored pgp ouput split into five parts, which when concatenated, decrypts back to the original truecrypt container
(scroll down to section [11], otherwise you may suffer hunger, thirst or incredible boredom if you try to read from the beginning ;-)) )

a simple corporate solution,
is for the company to generate a gnupg keypair for each employee,
have the employee change the passphrase as desired,
and have the employees generate their own separate signing keys (not subkeys)
then the company can simply inform all employees that any and all encrypted mail sent or received by the company must have a recipient key id that is on the company's 'accepted' list of employee encryption keys, or the corporate mail filter will discard this way, the employees are responsible for their own signatures, which cannot be forged by the company, and are aware that the company can read all company related e-mail,
and no patents are even remotely infringed upon
employees who really want to deceive the company, can send encrypted files another way, (cdrw truecrypt containers by snail mail, using gnupg  on private home computers etc.), and there is no simple solution to stop it.

there is no 'technical fix'
the company is simply keeping its own copy of a keypair that it generates for an employee,
just as it would hold onto a copy of the physical key it generates for the lock on the employee's office door
that said, it's always a good idea to consult with the legal people before any such solutions are implemented
it just seemed reasonable enough and inexpensive enough,
to suggest it to any companies that need it,
and leave the legal follow-up to them
the more companies that adopt a gnupg/pgp solution,
the more that employees will become familiar with encryption,

my point was that you don't need to enter the *complete* passphrase at all, or even 'any' part of it,
all you have to do is press the 'enter' key without typing pressing the 'enter' key 9 times quickly, is something i can live with without bothering the developers

have often wondered about this,
if this is so,
wouldn't it make more sense to have gnupg use 3DES as the default cipher instead of CAST-5
it might have made sense historically when pgp moved to version 5 +,
and used CAST-5 as default, that gnupg used CAST-5 as the default cipher to protect the secret key, and also the default cipher for (i haven't used pgp for a long time now,
[ since 8.x ],
so i don't know for sure, but i don't think they still use CAST-5 as a default,
but in any event,
if 3-DES is the 'open-pgp must implement'
it would make more sense to start using it as the secret key (or at least, as the symmetrical encryption default, unbundled from being the same as the cipher for the secret key) )
for practical purposes, it can be done easily enough by using gnupg and isn't a 'priority' issue,
but was curious if there is any reason that gnupg doesn't want to make 3-DES the default

suggestion only, for a workaround,
that allows the user to choose which cipher to use for encryption
to begin with
my suggestion is *after* Camellia is enabled in a hacked version and unable to be decrypted in the hacked version when the message was encrypted using Camellia in a later version
the problem with changing the name of the cipher in a later (open-
pgp approved version) is that when the session key is retrieved from the public key encrypted packet, it needs to know what cipher it is to be plugged into to decrypt
for the sake of illustration,
let's say that a newer version that may be calling Camellia with the identifier of 13,
the older version, which thinks that Camellia is 11, and is using 13 for yet another cipher,  will not be able to decrypt the message from the newer version that used the identifier 13, because it is trying to use the session key with the wrong cipher
my workaround suggestion,
was similar to the solution for decryption of messages done with the throw-keyid option
Disastry's last version of pgp 2.3i-multi-6,
had two variations of the throw-keyid option:
random keyid,
and fake keyid
in both variations, the keyid listed as part of the pgp message,
was NOT the public key that the session key was encrypted to

in general,
the simplest, most secure way,
is to keep gnupg on your laptop,
and use the usb to transfer files from the public computer
to your laptop and back again
encrypting and decrypting while directly connected to a public runs a very real risk of having the plaintext stored in some recoverable form on that computer
(i would recommend a Toshiba Libretto,
that you can literally have physical control over,
at all times)
if you don't have a laptop,
and need to work from a public computer, and a usb,
here are some guidelines:
[1] generate a new gnupg key, with a comment, 'usb key',
and keep this in a separate keyring (not the the keyring with your 'real' secret keys)
if you have any concern that this becomes compromised,
you can revoke it, without compromising your 'real' keys
(this is also a common courtesy to people who send encrypted mail to you
they are entrusting their secret/personal correspondence to you, and need to know how much they can 'trust' you
'trust' is this context,
refers to 'skill and judgment', not 'integrity'
[ you can 'trust' someone with your life and money,
but not to drive your BMW, if you don't think they have enough experience with a stickshift ] )
[2] keep the keyrings and the entire gnupg program in a truecrypt container on the usb
this has two advantages:
(a) it protects your keyrings
(b) it allows you to pick a drive letter that will stay the same regardless of the hardware differences of the various public (i.e., you can mount the truecrypt container as drive Z,
and have all the entries in your gpg.conf refer to z:\gnupg,
and never have to change it)
truecrypt can be run in traveller mode from a usb, without having it installed on the host computer
[3]copy the entire gnupg directory from your home computer,
into the truecrypt container
[4] put these lines into your gpg.conf file:
keyring z:\gnupg\pubring.gpg
secret-keyring z:\gnupg\secring.gpg
(use your 'new' keyrings with the special 'usb key')
[5] open notepad and types these lines:
command com
cd gnupg
save this as gusb.bat in your truecrypt container
whenever you want to run gnupg from the usb,
(and have already mounted the truecrypt container as drive z:)
double-clicking on gusb.bat
opens a dos commandline window
check it by typing gpg -h
if the gnupg version and guide appears, then you're ready
[6] minor recommendation,
(i don't know how much it would help)
get (free) editpad lite:
it can be run from the usb by just copying the file EditPadLite.exe
you can compose any correspondence from editpadlite, without using any of the host computers software (e.g. word, wordpad, notepad, and there 'might' be less chance of the plaintext being saved on the host computer by some file journaling system)

for the passphrase to be as secure as a 128 bit block cipher,
it needs to have 20 random keyboard characters

i don't know what the correction factor needs to be if someone uses non-random long passphrases of dictionary words,

a nice way to include special characters,
is to use equations or programming notation as part of the (here we have a unique luxury :-)

... I will be carrying my private key with me ... I'd like to know the suggested way to keep the key safe.
many people have different opinions on this,
here is what i do:
[1] make a true-crypt container just large enough to contain your secret keyring (minimum container volume is 19 kb)
[2] encrypt the truecrypt container using a keyfile rather than a [3] for the keyfile,
(a)use any detached gnupg .sig file that you signed and are keeping on your flash drive (e.g. your truecrypt traveller programthat you (b)armor the .sig file using the gnupg --emarmor command
(c)replace the "Comment" string with a good passphrase
use the resulting gnupg enarmored .asc file with your passphrase as the comment,
as your keyfile
[4] erase this keyfile after mounting the container
[5] reconstruct it whenever you need to
this has the advantage that your keyfile is not useably present on your usb,
but can be re-constructed by you at any time,
[6] when constructing your truecrypt container, create it without an extension
[7] when storing it, rename it with an .exe extension
(tends to keep people from clicking on it, or copying it ;-)) )
[8] before mounting the container,
rename it back to what it was, without the .exe extension
truecrypt can be run in Traveller mode without being installed on your computer
(i.e. you can intentionally not install it on your laptop,
and just run it from your usb,
and then remove the registry entries after each use, if you want to and like to devote extra time to these sorts of things ;-) )

not 'impossible'
just *tediously inconvenient* ;-)
for discussion purposes, assume the following:
[1] a 1 gig usb drive
[2] a true-crypt container of 1 gig (actually somewhat less, but whatever it is, to fill the drive)
[3] a hidden volume of 100 mb
if you know that you are going to a repressive area where you will be forced to reveal everything and prove that there is nothing left then you can:
(a) copy the hidden volume to somewhere else, well out of the influence of the interrogators, and leave it there until you are safely home
(b) erase the hidden volume from the truecrypt container (Peter Guttmann 35 pass, should work fine, considering the next few (c) copy whatever convincingly private information you have on the hidden volume, that you don't mind the interrogators having, into the truecrypt volume;
(your medical information, SAT scores, parking tickets, tax returns, etc. ;-)
[all stuff that they can get without you anyway, and verify] )
(d) fill up the rest of the truecrypt container with free open source programs that you like to take with you, to recreate on whatever laptop you might want to use,
some excellent space-fillers are:
cygwin components and libraries
grc compilers
ubuntu packages
python programs, libraries and documentation,
any number of downloadable pdf books, videos, or music
(keep them 'legal' ;-) )
if there is no space left for a hidden volume in the truecrypt container or on the usb drive,
then there is no possible hidden volume,
something even the interrogator should be able to see ...
this means you can't take a laptop with you,
unless you fill the harddrive the same way
[although not that hard to do if you absolutely must,
and are a film buff,
20 to 40 movies added to what's ordinarily on your laptop,
will easily fill a 160 gig drive] )

the Shamir split-key/secret sharing,
works for shares of 'keys',
not for passwords
here is a quote from the site:
=====[begin quote]=====
Note that Shamir's scheme is provable secure, that means: in a (t,n) scheme one can prove that it makes no difference whether an attacker has t-1 valid shares at his disposal or none at all; as long as he has less than t shares, there is no better option than guessing to find out the secret.
=====[end quote]=====
key structures are much more complex than passphrases
assume a passphrase of 16 characters that is shared among two people
each having 8 characters protected by Shamir's secret sharing
even though each person cannot 'decrypt' the other person's 'share',
(that part is true),
each one can start from scratch and do a brute force attack on the other 8 characters when combined with the 8 characters already known, and recover the passphrase
when Shamir uses the technique to share 'Keys'
the 'key', which is far more complex than a simple password string,
cannot be reconstructed from a brute force attack, even when t-1 shares are known
'split-keys' have been used by pgp since 6.x,
(usually for 'corporate signing'
when a certain majority t/n is needed for approval of a measure,
although it could work as well for decrypting too)

@_subject: Signature semantics 
one of the ways to protect Alice (or any unwary sender)
is to have a feature to do exactly that,
that if a message is sent signed and encrypted,
to have gnupg prompt the following:
gpg: you have chosen to sign and encrypt your message
gpg: would you like to have gnupg add a line to the plaintext before the signature, saying "this message is encrypted to " ?  y/n
gpg: you have chosen  n
gpg: your signed and encrypted message can separated and re-
encrypted to another key with its signature intact
gpg: really choose n ? y/n
this way,
if Alice started her message with,
" Hi Baker!"
she can ignore the option,
but if she were unaware of it,
she could opt for adding the line,
and the re-encryption attack would be defeated by having the original recipient verified by the signature
i know it's a 'change to the plaintext'
but it's a change where the user is asked for permission beforehand,
and can always choose to deny gnupg to do so
not meant to be an 'open-pgp feature request'
just a 'courtesy gnupg request'
(no reason that gnupg can't be 'better' than what open-pgp' as long as gnupg is 'compatible')

[i couldn't find it in their documentation on why they decided on the limit of 64]
i 'thought'
that the reason that this was so,
was either that
[1] a 64 character passphrase should be more than enough for even the most paranoid user, if it could even be remembered reliably accurately ;-)
or [2] a passphrase for a block cipher that has a 64 character session key *somehow* wouldn't provide any 'more' protection if it exceeded 64 (although am a little *fuzzy* at this point, because a session key has 64 hexadecimal characters, and a passphrase of 64 'keyboard' characters is way beyond 2^256 possibilities)
is this inaccurate?
is there a 'ceiling' limit, beyond which a passphrase length does not cryptographically protect the key?
(not a limit beyond which it is 'easier' to attack the key than the that's easy to figure out, depending on if random characters are used, or diceware words, or other options with a known total number of possibilities,
{i.e. for random 95 keyboard characters
 [ 95^39 ~= 1.35 x 10^77 ] > [2^256 ~= 1.15 x 10^77 ] },
but a limit where the password length after it becomes a key,
doesn't provide any more protection ?
so, does it depend only on the hash?
if SHA-512 were to be used,
would it mean that the passphrase could theoretically be 2^512-1 ?

i don't know much about php scripts on ssl sites,
but if you accept that part of your plan as 'secure',
then this may be a way of using gnupg to accomplish what you want:
[1] generate a keypair that you don't use for anything, and keep the resulting public and secret keyrings on the server
(this will eliminate any error messages from gnupg, as well as providing a secret keyring to be able to import into)
[2] when you are ready to decrypt, import the secret key from your php script
[3] when you are done, remove the secret key from the keyring,
with this command:
gpg --delete-secret-key 0x'rest of numeric key id'
(the man.page says that for batch files, the key 'name' is not good for this command)

you were quite correct in your earlier post, in your understanding

another things that affects how gnupg chooses a cipher is
the option of;

if both posts are technically correct
but, practically,
the problem is that NO newer version of PGP, will use anything besides IDEA to encrypt to a pgp 2.6 key,
so, while you can use gnupg to encrypt to that key, using ANY cipher, and PGP can decrypt it (as long as the version of PGP used has that i.e., PGP 6x doesn't have AES, so it can't decrypt an AES message, but PGP 9.x does and can)
you will still not be able to use gnupg to decrypt any message done in ANY version of PGP that encrypts to a pgp 2.x key, unless you have IDEA
installed in your gnupg
to make life simple for you,
if you aren't a stickler for the IDEA patent issues, and if you don't get any grief from the legal team at your work,
just put IDEA into your gnupg;
[1] get the IDEA module:
[2] unzip this to your gnupg folder (c:\gnupg)
[3] put this line into your gpg.conf file:
load-extension c:\gnupg\IDEA.dll
now you can decrypt whatever the client sends to you
as the client uses pgp 6.5.8
just ask the client to generate a new DH/DSA key
(REAL 'diehard' pgp 2.x users, don't use anything besides 2.x ;-)
so if the client already has 6.5.8
he may be more amenable to making a new key,
and then all you have to do, is use the option of --pgp6
and gnupg will automatically make sure that everything you send can be decrypted and verified by 6.5.8)

Wed Sep 17 18:21:42 CEST 2008 :
why then, if there are no preferences used, or listed in the gpg.conf file,
does gnupg use CAST-5 instead of 3DES 'by default' for symmetric encryption when no key is used.
c:\gnupg>gpg -c c:\t.txt
gpg: using cipher CAST5
gpg: writing to `c:\t.txt.gpg'
by when gnupg generates a new key, even though the top of the key's preferences is AES, the cipher which protects the secret key, is still CAST-5 and not 3DES
if there were a new minimalist 'open pgp implementation' that used only 3DES as its encryption algorithm, and gnupg send a symmetrically encypted message,
then 'by gnupg default settings' it would be incompatible.
(some people actually do send conventionally encrypted messages to users they know personally, ;-)
"great to hear that you're using an open-pgp program,
i'll be sending you my public key in an encrypted message that only needs a passphrase,
i wrote it down for you, here,
then send me a reply that is encrypted to my key"
theoretically, also
if someone wanted to use this new program that had only 3DES, and tried to import a keypair made with the default setting in gnupg, it wouldn't be usable, because the secret key is, 'by default' protected with CAST-5, not 3DES

it's possible,
but 'tedious' ;-)
[1] use the gnupg option of  --pgp6
(and, if you must continue using 6.5.8 until you can upgrade to something newer,
please ask gnupg users you correspond with, to also use the option of --pgp6 )
[2] now the 'tedious' part,
if you want to export both the secret and public keys,
then you have to remove the passphrase from the gnupg secret keys,
as the gnupg default secret key protection is newer than 6.5.8 and can't recognize it
you can then set the passphrase in 6.5.8 for that keyring,
and then set them back in gnupg for the gnupg keys
even though pgp6.5.8 is quite ancient,
it can still do some very surprising things ;-)
if you want to play around with your gnupg keys in 6.5.8
and see how 'compatible' they are or aren't
you don't have to import them at all
you can just set your pgp options (temporarily)
to point to your gnupg keyrings, and 6.5.8 will recognize them
[in the PGP tray, right click on 'Options', then on 'Files', then on 'browse' to find the locations of your pubring.gpg for the Public Keyring File, and secring.gpg for your Private Keyring File, then click OK]
you can now sign, encrypt, verify, etc. with almost any gnupg key
(just don't try to 'edit' a key, or generate a new one ;-) ) and you can compare the error messages you get when trying to decrypt with a gnupg key that you haven't removed the passphrase from, and a key where you have removed the passphrase
there are 'too many' little incompatibility 'workarounds'
that you might need to do, if you continue using 6.5.8  ;-((

decrypt all the messages/files encrypted to that key,

then zip all the encrypted files with their session keys together,

is if you want to retain a certain anonymity,

no different,
but unless you choose a sufficiently long and random passphrase,
symmetric crypto with a passphrase string-2-key
is much less protected than when the session key is encrypted to an unknown asymmetric key
the former is attackable by attacking the passphrase,
the latter cannot be attacked without the keypair and the (and not vulnerable to any symmetric decryption 'shortcuts' like the pgp vulnerability described a few years ago)
there are probably many effective ways,

what if the decryption program didn't know when it had successfully decrypted ...
(a) change the ciphertext, and let the brute force machine merrily try to crack the wrong ciphertext ...
(re-encrypt the ciphertext with another random session key,
then if the brute force attack tries all possible ciphertexts to find which one is the right one,
it sort-of becomes similar to attacking an OTP, in that the brute force decryption would yield several plaintexts of contradictory in practice, though,
the attacking program could just brute force the keyspace of the re-
encrypted ciphertext, until it would get a ciphertext that would decrypt to a real unless there is a way to re-encrypt the ciphertext in a way that it could produce multiple different plaintexts when using different session keys, it wouldn't work

this sounds like there might be a 'problem' ...
there are people who 'can' use 'any' cipher, but prefer a particular one,
or have a company policy to use a specific one, e.g .  AES-256 or and there are people whose programs can use only 'one' cipher, and no others
at the risk of taking 'wild guesses' ;-)
the only situations i can think of where a person 'cannot' accept anything other than one cipher are:
[1] a die-hard pgp 2.x user who needs a v3 key using IDEA
(yes, they still exist, but probably won't survive the move to 64 bit systems)
[2] a company that is bound by some standard to use AES or 3DES
(i can't imagine any company really insisting on 'only Blowfish' and nothing else ;-) )
[ anyway, it was 'cracked on 24' and shown on network tv to have a 'backdoor' ;-) ]
{please excuse the 'semi-off' geek humor, blowfish has 'no' backdoor and is still quite secure, no matter what hollywood writers say ;-)) }
if you have situation [1], you are out of luck using any current gnupg or pgp,
(there was a post on how to do this with an older gnupg version, but it would be much simpler to just use pgp2.x to generate it)
if you have situation [2],
it is much easier,
temporarily put the following 2 lines in your gpg.conf
s2k-cipher-algo name ('name' is the name of the cipher your client then save your gpg.conf
and run
gpg --gen-key
the key will be generated with the cipher your client wants
if this still doesn't help,
then please post 'exactly' what you need done

a trivial way to defeat this,
would be to provide each client with a pgp keypair, (physically presented to the client upon the initial transaction and then encrypt the zipfile to a key and not even use a passphrase
what would be even more interesting,
is if it could be done in a way that truecrypt uses to protect its encrypted volumes, where the user can choose to use a keyfile as well as a passphrase, but it cannot be determined before decryption if a keyfile, passphrase, both or only one,  has been used
so, imagine if a client has a zipfile encrypted to both a trivial password and to a pgp key, and it is not determinable from the encrypted file itself, if it was encrypted to a key as well,
all the cloud computing resources available will merrily spin themselves into exhaustion ubtil they decide that the passphrase is 'probably too long and complex to crack'

@_subject: Is it possible to decide what is a gpg file? 
There is no way (yet, ;-) ), to do what you want in gnupg, as a gnupg encrypted file will show that it was encrypted either symmetrically or to a key.
But, if you don't mind XOR-ing with a large pad, and you have a secure place to keep the pad, (not on the computer with the encrypted files),
you can do something like the following:
[1] Encrypt whatever file you want using gnupg, and the options of --throw-keyids  --armor
This will produce a ciphertext output of the encrypted file, with no information about the key it was encrypted to, except for the type (dh, rsa) and the size.
[2] Find, or write, a document equal to or greater, than the size of the file in [1], and save it on your computer, and do not save the file in [1].
[3] Construct a pad that XOR's from the file in [2] to the file in [4] Save the pad securely somewhere else.
[5] If the pad is discovered, people will expect to use it to apply to a ciphertext and recover a plaintext, not the other way around, and you have no ciphertexts on your computer, and even if it were used correctly to recover the ciphertext, the plaintext still cannot be recovered without the key and passphrase.
Only you know what your threat model is.
This will probably not be a good idea to use if your threat model includes dangerous determined adversaries who know the field.

@_subject: Is it possible to decide what is a gpg file? 
That's what i thought that he wanted.
Unfortunately, steganography is very difficult to achieve. ;-((
Unlike cryptography, where the standard is that the encryption is secure, even when the algorithm is known and well studied, no such progress has been achieved (afaik) in steganography.
Stego relies mainly on creative obscurity. The Holy Grail of a zero-
distortion stego carrier has not yet been found. The standard stego carriers (image files, audio, video files) have been well analyzed, and there is still detectable distortion in a carrier stego file when compared to a normal file of the same size and filetype.
Gnupg presents a great opportunity for use of text as a non-
detectable distortion carrier in the advancement of steganography.
Extending the example i gave above, it can be tweaked to provide increased levels of deniability that approach acceptable levels of crypto security.
(i.e.  it should be just as difficult to prove that a file is steganographically hidden, as it would be to crack a 256 bit symmetric encryption algorithm.)
[1] Assuming a gnupg encrypted ciphertext of size 'k', and that are more than 95 ordinary files greater than size 'k' on the computer that plausibly belong there.
(for a concrete example that's easier to follow, assume the ciphertext has 400 lines)
[2] Pick any 40 such ordinary files of this size (and remember them ;-)) )
[3] Armor them using the --enarmor command to produce an armored text representation of the file.
[4] Select 10 lines from each of the 40 gpg enarmored files, and concatenate them to a 400 line text
[5] Make a pad to XOR from the text in [4], to the desired [6] Save the pad securely somewhere else.
[7] Even if the pad is recovered, it cannot reasonably be proved that it XOR's to anything on the computer that would produce a This is just a rough draft of a consideration ;-)
What needs to be taken into account, is which parts of the gnupg ciphertext act as a 'plaintext' in showing that an encrypted file is present, and how to effectively increase the stego 'carrier space', to hide those lines.
it might be an interesting area of steganography exploration ;-)

@_subject: very short plaintexts symmetrically encrypted 
have been playing around with symmetrical encryption, and noticed something potentially concerning.
Here are 6 symmetrically encrypted short plaintexts:
Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (MingW32) Comment: passphrase sss
-----END PGP MESSAGE-----
The first 3 encryptions are of the word 'no', while the second 3 are of the word 'yes'.
All 6 are with the same passphrase 'sss' and the same algorithm, For the first 3, where only 2 letters of plaintext are encrypted,
the pgp encryption (before the checksum), ends in the '=' padding For the second 3, where 3 letters are encrypted, the message ends in a different character (no padding).
Should it be 'this easy' to distinguish the relative lengths of plaintexts just by looking at the ascii armor??  Obviously, encryptions of much longer plaintexts can't be expected to be the same size as that of a 2 character plaintext, and I haven't taken a long careful look at this, but I suspect that by increasing the plaintext one character at a time, and looking at the encrypted outputs, it should be possible to detect 'ranges' of plaintext length that correspond to a particular ciphertext length for symmetrically encrypted unsigned messages.
At any rate, it seems disturbingly easy to distinguish between symmetrically encrypted messages having only the word 'yes' or 'no' just by 'looking' at the ciphertext.

@_subject: very short plaintexts symmetrically encrypted 
i have no problem with this,
there is a trivial workaround to make everybody happy:
simply pad the plaintext manually to a total of eight characters
(am assuming that the words 'yes' or 'no' are less than 8 characters in all languages using open-pgp ;-) )
i.e.  'no******' or  'yes*****'
and then symmetrically encrypt.
symmetrical encryption is a simple way to avoid signing, while still maintaining relative reliability of knowledge as to who sent the message
(for a good passphrase, usually, only the person who knows the passphrase encrypted and sent it,)
the issue is, that if people 'trust' open-pgp
(and i do , and 'love' it, and am not trying to find fault with it)
to symmetrically encrypt messages,
then there should be some sort of alert or advisory that the plaintext should be a minimum length
(whatever that minimum length or alert/advisory should be,
i leave it up to the developers or the ietf open-pgp wg ;-) )

it is not a great idea to use hushmail keys for open pgp encryption or authentication
(1) the keys are not updated, and can't be for the same email so, for example, i've been with hushmail since it started, and my key is a 1024 bit key and signs with SHA-1
(to be fair, i imagine that whenever this becomes a 'real' threat, hushmail will allow for modifications/new keys)
(2) the hushmail user probably will not be able to decrypt a gnupg encrypted message in hushmail if the encryption algorithm chosen isn't currently being used by hushmail, which, depending on how old the key is, may not be the encryption algorithm listed on the key,
and if the hushmail user uses gnupg (preferable ;-) ), then he/she would be better off generating a new key in gnupg, and just leave the hushmail key for hushmail users

The problem here is one that PGP users can't fix.
No matter what you set the key preferences for, PGP (up through 8.x, don't know about 9.x), will insist on using IDEA when encrypting to this 96B12847 key. It will just do it that way by default, and without the PGP user being able to change it.
So, your practical choices are:
[1] revoke this key
(no problem unless you need to correspond with PGP 2.x users,)
[2] configure your GnuPG for IDEA, if PGP users are still going to use this key.
(a)get IDEA from here:
(b)add this line to your gpg.conf
load-extension (wherever you saved idea.dll)\idea.dll
(c) type gpg -h
and see if IDEA is listed.
It should be listed as follows:

The problem was on the PGP end. The company using PGP6.x couldn't decrypt, and the error message, "bad session keys" indicates that the it didn't recognize the algorithm used, (probably AES or another one that came after PGP 6.x. )
David's advice of using the option of --PGP6 on the GnuPG side will make everything work again on the PGP end.
