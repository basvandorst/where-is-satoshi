@_subject: Running GPG from a PHP Script under Windows 
I'm trying to run gpg in a php script under Windows using Apache. It works
fine using a batch file but using the same code using exec calls fails. Any
suggestions ?

@_subject: GPG Confirmation 
I was given a new key to use with our partner for encryption. Previously, the
key was working fine. I removed  all keys and then imported our key and then
the partner's key. I set trust to ultimate. The encryption works but I now
get a confirmation message.How can I get rid of this confirmation message so
I can batch my encryption ?

@_subject: Import Secret Key 
I was sent a file to decrypt. I got an error saying "secret key not
available". I then tried to import a secret key from my original file. I got
an error "permission Denied" along wile "file rename error"   and "error
reading file". What am I doing wrong ?
