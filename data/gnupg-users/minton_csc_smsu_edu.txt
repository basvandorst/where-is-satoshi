Hash: SHA1
yes, but not completely, since at a later time, you can always produce your
public key at a later time if necessary to prove that you did in fact write a
given message, or that you did not.  However, except for special
circumstances, I can't imagine any reason not to send your public key to the
keyserver, especially if you are going to be publishing (eg on a list) signed
and yet you signed the message :-)

@_subject: Question regarding clearsigning emails automatically 
Hash: SHA1
okay, that makes sense.  If you upload your key, and send messages with it,
and have several people who are associated with you in real life, there is a
pretty good chance that the key is in fact your key. The only possible
scenario in which you might be able to prove (or at least indicate) that you
didn't write a message, would be if it was *purportedly* signed with your key,
but the signature doesn't verify.  However, even then, that is not really
proof.  However, I stand by my statement that you might need to prove that you
did write a message.  On the gripping hand, that still doesn't give any
plausible scenario for not sending your key.  Given that the keyservers may be
accessed through email and http, as well as the modified http used normally, I
don't see any reason for someone to be sending messages to a public forum and
not sending the public key to the keyserver.  Mind you in a closed setting
such as a corporate intranet, with messages not going out to the internet, I
suppose you wouldn't need to, but otherwise, I don't see any reason why people
don't do it, except that perhaps they aren't aware of the existence of the
public keyservers.

Hash: SHA1
Generally, no.  While some keyservers will allow you to email the
administrator and ask for your key to be deleted, the chances are that it will
have already propogated to the other servers.  If all you want to do is add a
userid, that will be easy to do.  If you want to delete a key or userid, I
suggest instead that you revoke it, if you still have the secret key
available.  Then upload the revoked key to the keyservers.  Note that if you
are using gpg, you will make a seperate revokation certificate which must be
imported before sending it to the keyservers (in the case of revoking the
entire key).

I would go ahead and make a new one, and revoke the old one.  This is because
who knows if they don't know your passphrase from some other source.  Of
course, if they were that interested, they could probably get your secret key
off of your computer without your knowledge or consent.   If you have used a
good passphrase that you are fairly sure would not be vulderable to attacks by
someone who may know a lot about you, as well as dictionary attacks, then you
might be ok.  If you generated your passphrase with something like diceware,
and have a typical 5 or 6 word passphrase, you should be fine.  On the
gripping hand, if it is your phone number ... :-)

no, because the signatures are only on the key, not on other signatures.  so
if two different people sign your key and upload it, there will be two
different signatures, which the keyserver automatically merges.  When you
download them again you get the whole thing and gpg will tell you two new
signatures added
also, are you on the mailing list?  If so, we should carry on this discussion
there, in case others may benefit from it.
