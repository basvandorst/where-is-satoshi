@_subject: Best Practices 
I'm currently in the process of changing my "primary" email address.  I have
hopes to make this a permanent transition, and have had some thoughts about
my existing GPG keypair.
For better or worse, I've been playing around with GPG since I was a
teenager, and (unfortunately) there are a number of keys on the keyservers
that bear my name.  The good news is that with the exception of one old
(2000) keypair, all the others that I no longer use have been revoked.  I
feel bad for the "litter" this introduces to the keyservers.
I currently have a 4096-bit RSA sign/encrypt keypair with no subkeys.  I
believe, but am not certain, that it was generated with SHA1 hashes.  (Is
there a way I can check?)  This keypair was generated in May of this year.
What is the best way to transition my email address?  Add a new UID and
revoke the old?  Should a new keypair be generated?  What is the
conventional wisdom on the strength of RSA-4096?
If a new keypair is generated, what length would be sufficient for a decent
(10+ year, preferrably 20+) margin of safety?  I know that there may be
unforeseen advances in computing that allow for keys to be broken rapidly
(Quantum computing, new sieve algorithms, etc.), but there's surely some
guidance based on the current generation of things.  keylength.com suggests
4096 bits should probably be fine.
In a new keypair, is it safe to use SHA512 for hashes?  I know SHA1 is
unlikely to hold up for 20+ years.  I can't say that SHA512 will, but it
will almost certainly outlast SHA1.
Is it considered best practice to use a "master key" only for key signing
and use separate subkeys for signing/encrypting data?
Most of the GPG best practices I can find online are quite dated, and since
the field of encryption is changing so rapidly, I thought the insights of
this group might be useful in my next steps.  Your help is appreciated.

I appreciate everyone's feedback on this matter.  Comments/questions
Only my oldest key (ca. 2000) is still in the wild, with a lost private
key.  Many lessons were learned from that.
Are there any disadvantages to distinct signature & encryption keys?  Seems
like there's benefit with little cost (other than a bigger keyring).  I'm
currently considering generating an offline-only master key and using that
to sign other keys.  Some of the other threads in the archives seemed to
recommend this.
it is used to sign data?  I guess that's the part that eludes me.
I've been looking at the thread earlier this month regarding smartcards.
Are the options from kernel concepts basically the full range of
GPG-compatible smart cards, or are there other products I haven't seen?
Obviously I'd need a new keypair if I switched to that, as they only go up
to RSA3k.
Thanks again,

@_subject: Best Practices 
My thoughts at this point are to generate a new RSA4k certify-only key,
generate subkeys (probably RSA2k) for each encrypt and sign, move the
primary key offline (stored in 2 secure places) and then use the subkeys for
daily operations.  This seems to be the method most people who are fairly
concerned with security are using.  I may place my keys on a smart card at
some point, but I haven't decided on that yet.  (I'm aware that there are
some attacks I'm vulnerable to by not using one, but the offline
certify/primary key should help mitigate some of that.)
In my gpg.conf, I have (other than keyserver/no-greeting/etc. settings):
personal-digest-preferences SHA512
cert-digest-algo SHA512
Are there any other settings (or changes to these) that would be considered
more "forward looking"?

@_subject: Smartcard PIN may be shorter than passphrase? 
Would it be reasonable to say that you may use a significantly smaller
PIN for your smartcard than would be required of a passphrase, since
the smartcard locks itself after 3 tries?
Since I don't use a reader with a pinpad, I must type my PIN in, and
thus have about 8 alpha-numeric characters for my regular PIN.  (The
admin PIN is somewhat longer.)  Would this be considered a reasonable
(Someone who can read the memory on a smart card by opening it up is
NOT in my threat model -- if they can do that, they have much easier
ways to coerce me into giving up my PIN.)

@_subject: Smartcard PIN may be shorter than passphrase? 
So even a 4-digit PIN would ensure a less than 1% chance of guessing
the PIN.  (Assuming that the user does not select obvious pins like
birthdates, anniversaries, etc.)  At 8 digits, the probability becomes
something like 6*10^-8, if I do the basic math correctly.  Seems
pretty secure.
Thanks Werner!

No, the OpenPGP v2 card can only handle up to RSA-3072.  Presumably
the change in 2.0.18 was made for future compatibility with other
cards.  (My guess, not based on any research.)
No, you can store a primary key.  And you can use the 3 slots for any
purpose (though I believe they must all tie to the same primary key.).
 It would be common to combine signing & certification into one key
(and I believe that is the default).
I don't think that would be an issue, but I can't be sure.  Keep in
mind that as long as the card is left in the reader, it would be
considered unlocked -- do you want to leave that laying around?  (It

Not at all a stupid question.  Your keyid actually refers to an entire
keypair -- both a public and private key.  It can also refer to a master
key with several subkeys, but that's a more advanced usage.
Your 2nd question deals with the design of public key cryptography in
general.  My explanation here is an oversimplification that glosses over
the technical details, but should suffice.  The way RSA and DSA work is
that anything encrypted by your public key can only be decrypted by your
private key, and anything encrypted by your private key can be decrypted
by your public key.  You never give ANYONE your private key.
When you sign a message, you essentially take a hash of the message
(SHA-1 commonly) that is basically a condensed form of the message.
Then you encrypt that with your PRIVATE key.  That is a signature  A
recipient can attempt to decrypt the signature using your public key.
If they are able to, they know your private key was used to produce the
signature, and if you have kept control of your private key, it must
have been signed by you.
Hope that helps.

IANAL, and am also not a certified forensics expert, but this feels very
suspicious to me.  Normally, with split-key, you have a system where you
need, say, 3 out of 4, 5 out of 7, or something like that, pieces to
reconstruct the key.  There are a couple of different techniques for
this, but that's tool-dependent.  So if they did that (a best practice)
they should still be able to reconstruct it without that one manager.
Otherwise, what would happen to important data if one manager "departs"
suddenly (quits, fired, medical emergency, etc.)?
As a hint, IF they had the data written to disk in the plain
(unencrypted) before encrypting it, and haven't written a whole lot to
that disk since (i.e., no wiping programs) then a forensic investigator
might be able to recover some/all of the unencrypted data.

The weaknesses documented there do not seem to apply to OpenPGP (and
hence GnuPG).  One, messages are not actually encrypted with RSA; a
symmetric algorithm is used to encrypt messages and the key to that
encryption is encrypted with RSA.  I believe that GnuPG uses a larger
encryption exponent, reducing the threat posed by the Chinese
Remainder Theorem.  The threat of the "same key" on that page only
applies where the RSA encryption was done to the plain text directly.
Likewise, OpenPGP signing is done on a hash of the plain text.

This key length concern is highly dependent on the threat model.  I
believe RSA-1024 is likely safe TODAY for MOST attacks.  That being
said, I could not, in good conscience, suggest that anyone generate a
1024 bit key today -- the lifetime on that is probably too short, and
almost any device (including most mobile devices that can handle some
form of OpenPGP) should be able to handle at least 2048 bit without
much trouble.  Section 5.6 of NIST Publiction 800-57
is the best guidance I use for key length selection.  NIST recommended
that use of 1024 bit RSA-type (IFC) keys be discontinued in 2010.
2048 is recommended through 2030.  I use a 4k master key
(certification only) and 3k keys for encrypt and sign.  Yes, this is
perhaps a bit paranoid, but I have yet to run into any device where I
feel the delay is unacceptable (my android phone included).
I don't believe that GPG alerts on key lengths at all, but it does
have suggested lengths at key generation time.

So, AMD sells Opterons with 12 cores in a single CPU.  It has a street
price of $770.  In 2007, the TILE64 was released (a CPU with 64 cores,
but not x86-compatible).  It's a safe assumption that the NSA *could*
have a NUMA supercomputer or a cluster with 8000+ cores TODAY, but
even with those resources, it's unlikely they could get your key, or
would invest the time to do so.
RSA-768 (a 768-bit modulus) was factored in December 2009, in a
process that took hundreds of computers two years to complete. [1]
The authors of [1] estimate that a 1024-bit RSA modulus would be 1000
times as difficult to factor, but would be achievable in a fashion
similar to theirs within a decade.  That being said, I believe (but
have no solid numbers to back) that 2048 is probably about 1,000,000
TIMES as difficult to factor as RSA-1024.  (I base this on a 1000 time
number from 768 to 1024, and the decreasing incidence of prime numbers
as we get larger values.)
The reality is, for the NSA to even invest the computing time that was
involved in the RSA-768 effort, you'd have to have done (or they would
need to believe that you have done or will do) something REALLY BIG.
Probably on the order of importing CBRN-type weaponry into the US.
And if they believe you're that bad, they will find a way to get at
your key (or rather, your plaintexts).
The ability to "casually" decrypt even 1024-bit keys is nowhere near.
(And by "casually", I mean a difficulty similarly to what it takes to
wiretap a phone.)

A very important distinction must be made between randomly-generated

still generating your own password.
If you value your OpenPGP key, I would not trust it to 24 bits of

Smartcards (including the one the OpenPGP smartcard is based on) are

without the PIN.  A highly sophisticated attacker MIGHT be able to get

you're probably talking about the intelligence agency of a major state
actor.  (Theoretical attack, I'm not aware of any open papers

These numbers are for a collision attack: that is, find *any* 2 values that
have the same SHA-1 value.  For OpenPGP purposes, we care about finding an
input that returns a preselected hash value (the fingerprint of another
key).  That's a "preimage" attack, and I'm not aware of any preimage
attacks on SHA-1, so we're back to the 2^160 (or 2^159, since, on average,
you only need to try half the space) complexity.

Hi Werner,
A question about the release notes:
* Decryption using smartcards keys > 3072 bit does not work.
Is this a regression (since it's listed as a change) or should it read
"does now work"?  I don't have any 4k keys on smartcards to try with, but
I'm interested to know the status.

@_subject: Rugged ID-000 form factor card reader? 
Does anyone know of a more rugged ID-000 (SIM card size) smart card reader
than the Gemalto?  I'm thinking of something with a metal case perhaps?
 The reason I ask is that I've had 2 gemalto readers have the plastic part
that attaches to a keyring break off.  I would hate to lose my smart card
in this way.
Even better would be a new smart card with a form factor similar to the
Yubikey Nano (
but that might be a pipe dream.

@_subject: USB key form-factor smart-card readers with pinpads? 
Ignoring the fact that if the machine you are using for crypto operations
is compromised, you have lost (at least for the operations conducted while
it is compromised), a smartcard without a PIN pad may compromise your pin
(and allow arbitrary operations while the smartcard is protected) but still
protects the key material itself.  Unless the malware has a history of all
your previous email, an attacker still doesn't have the key to compromise
your past email.
The smartcard (without a PIN pad) also allows for use of a lower-entropy
passphrase/PIN than Scenario 1 in the case of theft.  Theft of a key stored
on disk is vulnerable to offline attack, theft of a key on a smartcard is
much harder to use (as the smartcard locks itself after some number of
wrong pins).  (This ignores three-letter-agency attacks against the
smartcard hardware to extract the key material from the EEPROM of the smart
card itself, bypassing the card applet.)

Or replace the message with a message of its choosing?  It just needs to
wait for you to want to do a legitimate signature, swap out the plaintext,
and then it has signed data.
Don't use sensitive keys on machines with malware?  (Yes, I realize proving
a machine is malware free is essentially impossible.)
Agreed, I was just arguing why a smartcard without a PIN pad still offers
some level of additional security.
You assume people choose good passphrases.  While that may be true for
readers of this list, that is not true of the general population.

If you're using Lubuntu, you probably just want to install the package via
apt-get: "apt-get install gnupg" (or gnupg2 for gpg2).  If its default
packages are similar to ubuntu, GPG1 should be installed by default.
If you really want to install from source, you'll need a C compiler
installed along with all the various dependencies.  The build-essential
package should get you started, but you might still need more.
