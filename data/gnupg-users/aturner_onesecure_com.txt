@_subject: using read-only fs for ~/.gnupg ? 
Hash: SHA1
I was wondering if anyone could give me any suggestions for setting up my
~/.gnupg dir on a read-only fs?  I'm using the --no-random-seed-file
option, but I'm still getting attempts to create temp files in the
directory.  So far, I haven't been able to determine any negative effects
of this, but it is a little worrisome.
Here's an example:
gpg: failed to create temporary file `/home/aturner/.gnupg/. Read-only file system
gpg: fatal: /home/aturner/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: can't create lock
secmem usage: 1632/1632 bytes in 3/3 blocks of pool 1632/16384
