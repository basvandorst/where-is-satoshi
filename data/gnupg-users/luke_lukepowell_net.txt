@_subject: Signature notations? 
I recently had to revoke a uid and when I did I was asked to give a
short notation about why I was revoking it. I'm curious as to how one
views those notations. I tried using the following command:
gpg --list-sigs --list-options\
show-unusable-uids,show-notations,show-sig-subpackets 7b4abdb3
but I didn't have any luck. Does anybody know if those notations are
stored, and if so, how they can be read out?

In this case I revoked a uid rather than a key or subkey. Would the
reason ever be shown for that scenario?

Well, it really depends a lot on your text editor. I use Vim, so my command is
gg!Ggpg -ae -r luke at lukepowell.net
That goes to the beginning of the file and filters all the text through the the process gpg -ae -r luke at lukepowell.net.
As for how to do it under Emacs, I'm sure another of these fine people can help. Also, if security is important, you'll want to make sure that any hard drive writes or backups are disabled. In Vim, you'll want to turn off the scratch file.
Hope that helps,
