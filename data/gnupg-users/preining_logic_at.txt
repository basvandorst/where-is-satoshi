@_subject: Strange behaviour with --list-keys 
Hi there!
Why is there such a big difference between=20
I have a keyring with a lot of RSA keys and get the following
$ time ./gpg --list-keys --with-colons
real    0m48.126s
user    0m6.610s
sys     0m41.360s
$ time ./gpg --list-keys
real    0m0.498s
user    0m0.360s
sys     0m0.030s
$ ./gpg --version

Well, I know this, I have a frontend (guard, automatically encrypts/signs
outgoing messages, transparent fopr apps) which reads exactely this
way the keys. Thats the reason why I want the --with-colons option to be FASTER, it
should be as fast as the --without-colons option!

@_subject: listing keys with-colon is sooo slow 
Why is this the case? list-keys without-colon works very very fast
and IMHO give the same information but in different format. Why then
is the --with-colon version a factor 10 slower then without.
