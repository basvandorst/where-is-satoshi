Hi All,
I'm trying to use the "keytocard" functionality in the GPGME python
bindings using the "interact" function. However, I can't figure out how to
get the callback to work. My callback does indeed get called, but how do I
return my response? Returning my response to the prompt as a string e.g
"fpr"  or "key 1" or "keytocard" simply causes my whole script to hang. Am
I doing something wrong? You can view the code and output here:
 . It seems like the script just hangs after
returning from the callback the second time...
I'm basically following this structure:
Any help much appreciated :)

Update, I found that this works on my system using the C bindings, but not
the Python bindings. Very confusing.
Using the C bindings, I had to put a newline when writing to the fd. I
tried putting a newline at the end of my return value in the callback in
the Python code, and that did not help :( It still just hangs.
