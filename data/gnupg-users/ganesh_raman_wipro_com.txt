@_subject: Java interface for GnuPG 
Hi !
    I would like to know whether there is any Java interface to
encrypt/decrypt stored files using GnuPG framework. Is there any Native
calls from Java for dynamic (automated) calls to encrypt/decrypt files?
    Any help in this regard will be greatly appreciated.
Pls. send a copy to ganesh.raman also.
