@_subject: encrypt memory stream 
Sorry about my English.
I'm new in GnuPG.
I'm using win32 version of gnupg and I would like to encrypt some text from
my C# code using gpg.exe.
Is it possible to encypt some text without saving it to an external file,
just encrypt stream in memory?
Is it possible to pass in the passphrase as a command-line argument or I
must use a key without passphrase?
