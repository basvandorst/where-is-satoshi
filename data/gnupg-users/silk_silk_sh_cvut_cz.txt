@_subject: large file decryption error (zlib) 
Hi all,
I've encrypted quite a large file (15 gigs) with gpg 1.2.1 and decryption
causes this error:
gpg: uncompressing failed: unknown compress algorithm
I've listed raw data size with -vv parameter and the size is wrong. It says
2651277312 bytes but it is too far to 15 gigs. And the error occurs right
when gpg decrypt this amout of bytes.
I've tryied to hack the gpg to continue after this limit, but
unsuccessfuly. Can anyone help me to decrypt this file or should I say good
bye to my data?
encryption method was: "gpg -e file" on Linux
Thank you, Petr Koloros

Hi Werner,
Exactly. But I've found the solution already:
--- ../gpg-1.2.1/gnupg-1.2.1/g10/parse-packet.c	2002-10-04 08:00:49.000000000 +0200
+++ g10/parse-packet.c	2003-10-13 17:36:44.000000000 +0200
 -2048,7 +2048,9  		pt->name[i] = c;
     }
     pt->timestamp = read_32(inp); if( pktlen) pktlen -= 4;
-    pt->len = pktlen;
+    //pt->len = pktlen;
+    pt->len = 0;
+    pt->is_partial = 1;
     pt->buf = inp;
     pktlen = 0;
Thank you very much for the explanation of the problem. I have all my data
decrypted successfuly now.
With best regards, Petr Koloros
