@_subject: Second problem...gpg or kgpg? 
SuSE 9.3 and Kgpg 1.2.1.
  I've never had a problem with kgpg before, in almost 4 years now, but if I can't figure out what's wrong all of a sudden with it like this, I'm going to look hard into that Seahorse, heh.

@_subject: Naming of GnuPG 
Speaking as a regular Joe, who can do very little cli stuff and just uses Linux (e-mail, web surfing, and an rpg game) because it looks and performs better than winblows and is safer, I'd simply just 'ask' what the difference was if I was new to encryption and such. I don't see the big deal here with the question and all the hulabaloo.
