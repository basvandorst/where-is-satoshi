To me cross-platform means at least some level of functionality=
 and ease of use for end-users, among other things. I spent =
quite some time with Gaim and its encryptions extension =
(gaim-e) and under Windows this seems pretty dead:
The only other Jabber client I know and I've tested =
successfully with Psi (meaning it's also JEP-0027[1] compliant)=
 is Gabber, which was the foundation for JEP-0027.
If anyone knows of others that follow JEP-0027, I'd be glad to =
test them.

@_subject: one key or multiple keys 
Hash: SHA1
"It depends" :) Some examples:
 - Privacy: many keys, each with emails adresses (or without =
any email at all) so there's no easy to track relationship =
between you hobbies/projects/etc. and your job/family/friends
 - Ease of maintenance: remembering passwords, collecting =
signatures and making sure you don't sign with the wrong key is=
 not easy with more keys
 - Experience: if you are doing tests, by all means generate =
revocation cers, don't publish to keyservers and/or set an =
expiration date of 6 months (or less) ;)
 - Business/project: If you have separate keys for =
business/project roles, a good rule is to sign those keys with =
your personal key, instead of collecting signatures on all. If =
Alice trusts you and you trust your business, then someone can =
decide if they trust your business key(s) based on their =
knowledge of Alice (or you).
 - Applications: in some occasions you may not want software =
that supports OpenPGP to use your precious super-secure key... =
maybe generate a new one and optionally sign it/assign it trust.
There's also the use of subkeys which you may want to read more=
 about.
If you have other examples, or if you get creative, share back =
here ;)

Yes. I would create one keyring with all public keys and separate keyrings for the private keys on each machine.
Basically, yes, if you define your model of trust to be that... But that is *your* decision. More on the Web of trust:
It seems most development happens (or used to happen) around PKS:
The Enigmail extension for TB could support advanced email header templating. This is currently being discussed in this RFE (Request for Feel free to participate in the discussion.

That depends if you are the local Chief Security Officer (or "GnuPG guy/girl"). As I said, you can pretty much decide whatever you want to do, or trust. Just keep in mind the implications.

@_subject: Sending signed emails to a large list 
I'd like to know if there are other ways to send email-merged messages that are signed using OpenPGP ?
So far I use an SMTP proxy such as GPG-relay (  ) combined with a Fletmail, a mailing list manager (client-based, not server) .
Although primitive, Fletmail under Windows does the job. I am looking for existing Linux-based solutions before creating one. Maybe something along the lines of PHPList + ..?
What would be other ways of doing this ?
