my Debian8.8 has the programs about gpg: -rwxr-xr-x  1 root   root    1128700 Sep  3  2016 gpg
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root   root     913236 Sep  3  2016 gpg2
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root   root     334260 Sep  3  2016 gpg-agent
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root   root     148108 Sep  3  2016 gpgconf
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root   root     165508 Sep  3  2016 gpg-connect-agent
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root   root      38144 Sep  3  2016 gpgkey2ssh
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root   root      25908 Sep  3  2016 gpgparsemail
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root   root      59104 Sep  3  2016 gpgsplit
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root   root     407820 Sep  3  2016 gpgv
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root   root       3303 Sep  3  2016 gpg-zip
Are they enough or no, for  verifying integrity of packages?
Also  is  ~/.gnupg

user at debian:~/.gnupg$ And I don;t know which program use: gpg or gpgv?
I guess don't enough  public keys at me. Please prompt me what to do, and excuse my stupid questions:
While I shall attempt operate with gpg or gpgv, of course there will done some wrong things. May I remove improper files, which will appear? Need I switch on cookies when try get keys? Reminding, me need justl verify screen-4.5.1.tar.gz by  screen-4.5.1.tar.gz.sig ,  I hope learn this program after.
Thanks all.
