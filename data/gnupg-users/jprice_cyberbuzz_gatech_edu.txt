@_subject: Have key ID, but can't decrypt. 
I have a feeling I'm being stupid.
When I 'gpg --list-keys', I get:
gpg: WARNING: using insecure memory!
gpg: please see  for more information
pub  1024D/F64BA00C 2002-10-07 Jason Price sub  1024g/6B38F22C 2002-10-07
pub  1024D/FAD37ABE 2002-08-24 Edward Graham V sub  4096g/34B2393A 2002-08-24
However, when I try and decrypt a message, I get:
gpg: WARNING: using insecure memory!
gpg: please see  for more information
gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit ELG-E key, ID 34B2393A, created 2002-08-24
      "Edward Graham V "
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
gpg: encrypted with 4096-bit ELG-E key, ID 34B2393A, created 2002-08-24
      "Edward Graham V "

That "keyid" is in my key ring.  Why can't I decrypt?
Thanks for any help;
