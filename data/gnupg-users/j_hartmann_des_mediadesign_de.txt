@_subject: problem with GPA on Win32 
i  downloaded the gnupg/gpa couple from  wich comes with=20
gnupg 1.0.4=20
So i tried to upgrade this to gnupg 1.0.6 which should just be to change=20
two files (gpg.exe and  gnupg.mo).
But unfortuantly this does not work :(
After the "update" i tried to create a key, but i got an error message
"invalid number of fields in GPG colon output" .
This message was shown 4 times.
Now gpa does not start anymore. There is a message which says
it is shut down because somethings went wrong.
In german "Die Anwendung wurde aufgrund eines ung=FCltigen Vorgangs=20
Is such an Update impossible ?  Or can i find a newer version of
gpa for Win32 somewhere ?
