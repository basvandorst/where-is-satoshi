@_subject: Change install directory (1.2.1) 
I'm trying to compile and install gnupg-1.2.1 for Solaris 8. I want to change the install directory to something different than /usr/local/bin so that I don't need root access. I don't want to use the --prefix option because I want to keep the default directory structure; I just want to change where "make install" puts the binaries. Is there a way to do this? I've looked through the INSTALL and README files with no luck.

Let me clarify what I was asking in my initial message (sorry about the confusion). What I'm looking for is to keep the default hierarchy (/usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, etc.), but I want the entire hierarchy to be installed in a directory that I specify, for example $HOME/gnupg. So, it would look like this after the install: $HOME/gnupg/usr/local/bin, $HOME/gnupg/usr/local/lib, and so on.
I know this may not be an issue unique to gnupg, but this is the first I've encountered this problem, which is also why my first post was confusing. I hope my question is clear now.
