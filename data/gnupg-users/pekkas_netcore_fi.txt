@_subject: Howto distribute key signatures 
I didn't see this covered in the Handbook, FAQs or anywhere.
I have a couple of RL friends who have GPG/PGP keys.  They're willing to
sign my public key.
Now the question becomes: how to proceed, or more specifically:
After they have checked my ID and signed the key, how should it be added
to the keyservers so that when someone gets my key from the keyserver,
they'd get the other peoples' signatures too?
One of them sent me my public key encrypted to me but I assume he didn't
do this right because the key inside was identical to my own.

Ok, now this makes some sense.  Could someone remedy the docs with this?
Yeah, must be that.  He was supposed to have done this before, so I
started to wonder wtf I was doing wrong.
Much clearer now, thanks.
