@_subject: Trying to convert from PGP on XP to a GUI on Win 7 
I've been using PGP 8.1 under Windows XP, but have to find a new GUI to use
under Windows 7. I found Gpg4win and figured out how to import my keyrings
bu changing the extension to gpg.  I was able to decrypt a previously
encrypted file using gpg2.exe. There didn't seem to be a GUI.  Reading thru
the manual, I see that there is supposed to be an extension/plug-in on the
Windows Explorer menu for GpgEX, but I don't see it.  What should I do?
I also found Cryptophane 0.7.0.  It has a GUI that is very remincent of PGP
8.1.  It seems to interface with the keyrings already imported, but I can't
use it to encrypt a file.  Although I signed the public key (and the program
shows that it has been signed), when I try to encrypt and/or sign a file, it
complains that the key is not signed.  Again, what should I do?
I'd be happy getting either program to work, or to use another program. Recommendations appreciated. Also, what is recommended to replace the secure
erase in PGP?

I have 64-bit Windows 7. But there may be a hope. Microsoft has an
emulator/virtual machine called Windows XP Mode THAT runs many older Windows
XP programs and that are "not natively compatible with Windows 7".  Do you
know if Gpg4win will install GpgEX running in Windows XP Mode?
