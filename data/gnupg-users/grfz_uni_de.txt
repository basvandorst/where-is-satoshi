@_subject: gpg --list-key shows keys twice 
Hi gnupg-users,
gpg --list-key shows pubkeys in pubring.gpg twice, whereas pubkeys from "included" pubring.pgp are single in the
listing (see below).                    ^^^
This is especially annoying, when using gpg in mutt: every time i
mail (and encrypt) to a person from which i have only one key
mutt asks me which one from the listing of two identical keys i
want to use for encrytion.
I am using gpg 1.06 as packed in debian sid. I reimported the
whole pubring.gpg but that did not help. Any ideas?
This is a listing which shows keys from gpg-pubring.gpg mixed
with keys from pgp-pubring.pgp:

@_subject: using a key without self-signature 
Dear gnupg-users,
i want to use a pub key which is has no self-signature.  I know I
can do this using the --allow-non-selfsigned-uid option. But i
want to use this key on an regular basis and search for a way
without this option.
Is there a way to --edit the key so I can use it?
Ciao, Gregor
