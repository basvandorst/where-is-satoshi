@_subject: On the fly encryption of files possible? 
Hello everyone,
does anyone know if there is a frontend for GnuPG or a software that uses
GnuPG where one can on-the-fly encrypt files thar are to be saved into a
distinct folder with a public key so they can only be read by a user that
has the private key?
Best Regards,

Hello Robert,
thank you very much for your quick answer.
I already looked at truecrypt and also many other whole disk
encryption/encrypted virtual drive software, but they always "mount" the
drive after entry of the password and then everyone with the correct
password has random access to the data (no PKI).
I need something that prevents the ones who write files from reading their
own or any other of the written files.
Best Regards,

Hello everyone,
I think I found something that may work for me.
Autokrypt allowes to regularly monitor folders for new files and to
automatically encrypt them with a GPG engine.
Not really on the fly, but at least automatically and with PKI.
If anyone finds something really working on the fly, he is always welcome.
Best Regards,
