@_subject: How to delete a signature from a key with delsig? 
I have two keys: - a personal key (used to sign this message); and
- a business key.
Inadvertently, I signed the business key with the personal key. Trying
to remove that personal signature with delsig fails.
Bringing up the business key with "gpg --edit-key " gives me
the "command>" prompt, at which point entering " delsig" runs
without an error message, but the personal key signature is still
attached to the business key when I run "gpg --list-sigs ".
Am I missing something terribly obvious here?

Thanks for taking the time. See below for the unexpected (to me at
least) solution.
Good point about the public servers, but in this case neither of the two
keys had been published. Also, fwiw this is on an Ubuntu 10.04 machine.
As for "how does it fail", the command> prompt from --edit-key
 kept returning "Invalid command (try "help")" for any input
not in the form "uid ." Whether a "delsig" was appended
to the command> or not, it returned to "command>" without affecting any
signature. I was unable to input a multi-line command without the
Invalid output. However, your response encouraged me to go back and hack at it some
more. After another failure and return to "command> (try "help")", I
actually tried "help" at the command prompt. Lo and behold, context
sensitive help. At the end of help's 30-item list of possible commands
"minimize    compact unusable user IDs and remove all signatures from
$ gpg --edit-key Typing "minimize" at the "command>" prompt returned:
"User ID "name ": 1 signature removed"; and
returned me to "command>" where a "save" command saved changes, quit GPG
and returned me to my shell prompt. The key's self-signature was intact and the unwanted personal key
signature was gone.
