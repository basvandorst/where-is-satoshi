@_subject: I need a portable GUI for GnuPG 
Have you checked:
Also I trying to get gpg safer while using it as portable app. This is
a nice freeware tool to avoid keyloggers.
But It was discussed here before.
If you have no control on your hardware, you cannot have your keys safer.

@_subject: One Time Password and GnuPG 
Hello fellow,
I was thinking how to make gnupg more safe when it's ruining into hostile
environments. The main idea is run my Gnupg in my pen drive as a portable
I did a quick research and I found GNUPG portable here
And thunderbird portable and enigmail
Then I started thinking IF the insecure computer have a Kellogg's ?
well I fund Neo's SafeKeys;
That is a virtual keyboard that can send to engmail the private key password
without type or using the keyboard.
But it still vulnerable to screenlogger's . So I was think if is possible to
use some kind of One Time Password System ..
Something like Perfect Paper Password ...
What do you think guys ?
All the best,
Andre Amorim

@_subject: Graphing Web of Trust 
Hello List,
I've been playing with sig2dot to draw graph from the keys stored in
my own keyring but,
How can I do a graph from diferents key sign parties?
Party 1 (A to Z members)
A1,B1,C1 ... Z1
Party 2 (AZ)
A2,B2,C2 ... Z2
Party 3 (AZ)
A3,B3,C3 ... Z3
Now some members of Party1, Party2 and Party3 had sign each other keys.
How can I draw a graph global of it (including Party1, Party2 and Party3) ?
and If all members of all parties had send they keys to same server is
possible draw a graph from the server files as a source..???

Thanks Charly Avital for explanations.
I know, I'd had read his others books firstly... and yes... I read
like Dan as who is reading comics books, no worrys.
The thing that really catch my attention was the concept of
rotating-cleartext thing.
But I think the book is good in the sense that it's encourage those
who are not expert in the subject to know more about. Thats why I'm
here asking.
