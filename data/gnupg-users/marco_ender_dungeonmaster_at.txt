@_subject: Error message "NOTE: cipher algorithm 7 not found in preferences" 
When i want to use Rijndael as my symmetric cipher and type the line
cipher-algo RIJNDAEL
into the options-file i get the error message mentioned in the subject
every time i decrypt a file. The funny thing is it still works to
decrypt the file. I imported the keys from PGP 7.0.3, if that matters
in any way...
tia for reading (and answering)
