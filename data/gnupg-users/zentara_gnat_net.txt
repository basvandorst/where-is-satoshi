@_subject: New UK crypto law and an idea on how to defeat it 
Bob's scheme omitted:
How about if Bob just claims it's an asymetric encryption with
some key held in his memory, and the "intimidation" made him
forget the key?
Also the government probably has "tempest scanners" and if you
are suspect, they can get your key and passphrase thru tempest
type bugging. Over here in America they show TV shows on how
the Briitsh government ride around checking for unregistered
Televisions in unmarked vans. It is a small step for them to sit out in
street and read your keystrokes. Once they get your secret key
passphrase, or asymmetric key, they got you.
Does Bob work in a Faraday cage? I'm old enough to remember when audio bugs were a new thing,
and nobody suspected a thing. Well computer data bugs are a new thing,
most users completely ignore it's implications. When was the last time you tore apart that little modem power block
on your desk, to check for suspicious ic chips? Did the "cleaning
lady" swap yours with a look-alike with a keystroke recorder in it?
Maybe she did it for a $100 bribe.
My point is real security is hard to come by when your opponent is the
government authorities. Bob's best bet is to use something like
Stenography and deny that he even uses encryption, and force them to
prove he is using it. I can see it now....Brits will be known for having great numbers
of jpegs on their harddrives. :-)

I am a newbie too, but I recalled something from

@_subject: Problems for PGP5 users to use my GPG-key. 
Hi again, this problem interests me as a newbie, because I will probably
encounter it myself.
Here is a clue from the README:
    If you already have a DSA key from PGP 5 (they call them DH/ElGamal)
    you can simply copy the pgp keyrings over the GnuPG keyrings after
    running gpg once to create the correct directory.
Maybe that is where the confusion is. PgP5 calls their DSA key
DH/ElGamal? Is this not
what the snippet above says?
Maybe when you do your new --gen-key, you could use option 2, generate
DSA key only.
That way you will encrypt with DSA, which should be compatible with

average hacker.

Here's mine:

@_subject: md5sum verification of gpg 
I am extrememly grateful for you to provide gpg.
It runs well and fixes a whole bunch of problems
that we had with pgp.
Now comes the question ot trust. I compiled my own, but didn't
check the source code. ( What good would it do me?; I'm not advanced
at C to recognize a backdoor if I saw it. :-)  ).
So I needed the md5sum check to validate my version and I see
2 trust problems. I am sure there are more, but I am ignorant of them.
I was thinking about this all day.
The first is:
Are there any rumors of backdoors in gpg?
I mean the md5sum is correct, but what is the integrity
of gnupg.org?  Is there an code oversight committee to check
releases for backdoors?
I hope that GnuPG isn't financed by Interpol.;-) Not that governmental security agencies are not good institutions,
but I don't want them controlling encryption code. They can spy
in other ways to get info on you. Of course I am not even suggesting
this is true. It is a trust issue, and I am wise about the
Machiavellian world. The second is:
How do I know that the email is not being spoon-fed to me?
I mean Werner could have posted email with the correct md5sum
of his copy, and someone on my server, (or along the route), could
edit his email to match the md5sum of the bogus copy that they switched
on me
when I downloaded. Thereby I would be fooled into thinking that I had confirmation from Werner about the validity of the download.
I find it worrisome that Werner didn't sign the md5sum file.
Signing was the first thing explained in the Readme.
Would you be kind enough to sign the md5sum file with ascii
armor and put it on the mail list? I mean it is ascii armored
so we could receive it thru email. It would only be a few k.
I don't understand why your mailer can't handle ascii armored files?
Also, why wouldn't it help us, it would say that it came from your
At least that is what the docs say.
At the very least it will be good practice for all us newbies, and
makes us think about it all more deeply.
Am I being overly paranoid here? I mean there are alot of agents with
computers out there
and alot of money goes into surveillance. Why not keep REAL crypto from
the average citizen?
And......how do we know that the people who run the newtworks are not
playing games with us?

I've read somewhere in the docs to sign your public key.
Where in the process do you sign it?
Do I export my public key with ascii armor, then sign the ascii
file, then give that out as my public key?
Or do I use the edit-key function and sign my key
while it is in my pubring.gpg, then export it with
