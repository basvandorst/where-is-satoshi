From the FAQ (
6.1) Why do I get "gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!" On many systems this program should be installed as setuid(root). This is necessary to lock memory pages. Locking memory pages prevents the operating system from writing them to disk and thereby keeping your secret keys really secret. If you get no warning message about insecure memory your operating system supports locking without being root. The program drops root privileges as soon as locked memory is allocated. On UnixWare 2.x and 7.x you should install GnuPG with the 'plock' privilege to get the same effect:         filepriv -f plock /path/to/gpg
If you can't or don't want to install GnuPG setuid(root), you can use the option "--no-secmem-warning" or put no-secmem-warning in your ~/.gnupg/options file (this disables the warning). On some systems (e.g., Windows) GnuPG does not lock memory pages and older GnuPG versions (<=1.0.4) issue the warning gpg: Please note that you don't have secure memory
This warning can't be switched off by the above option because it was thought to be a too serious issue. However, it confused users too much so the warning was eventually removed. Hope this helps,

@_subject: Using Stamper service with GnuPG (aka using non-selfsigned 
Hash: SHA1
I've been trying to use the Stamper service
( with GnuPG but I seem to be
having problems due to the public key not being self signed. I have
emailed Matthew Richardson who runs the service and he says that he
does not want to sign they key since he only wants things that have gone
through stamper to be signed by this private key.
I have been able to import the key using --allow-non-selfsigned-uid
but when I attempt to verify anything it says that the key is invalid
(see below), even if I have signed it myself.
Is there any way to stop this happening and also are there any
security issues involved with verifying signatures by non-selfsigned
Thank you in advance,
Steven Murdoch.
