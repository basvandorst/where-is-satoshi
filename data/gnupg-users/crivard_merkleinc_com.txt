@_subject: GPG 1.4.19 homedir Command 
I am running GPG 1.4.19 and using the --homedir command and enclosing the home directory name in double-quotes to access a keyring folder that has an embedded space.
                --homedir  "\\folder\Key Ring"
I get errors from GPG stating
gpg: keyblock resource ' //folder/Key\secring.gpg : file open error
gpg: keyblock resource ' //folder/Key\pubring.gpg : file open error
usage: gpg [options] [filename]
Other commands like --output and --encrypt work just fine when enclosing path in double-quotes.  Am I doing something wrong or does GPG --homedir not accept double-quotes and thus embedded spaces in path name?

This worked when I removed the trailing "\" from the --homedir directory Thanks. -----Original Message-----

Both of these worked for me.
F:\>"c:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\gpg.exe" --homedir "f:\abc def\gpg" --list-keys F:\>"c:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\gpg.exe" --homedir "\abc def\gpg" Try dropping the initial double slash.

I currently have GPG 1.4.8 installed on a Windows server.  Can the c:\Programs Files (x86)\GNU\ directory simply be copied to another server and used or do I need to go through the "download and installation" process on the new server?   Thanks.

I am running gpg command so I believe yes is the answer.  (I am a novice at this so still learning.)  -----Original Message-----

Are you using gpg-agent to handle ssh agent responsibilities, yes or no?

That question was for Paulo, not you. :)  And FWIW, since you're using GnuPG 1.x the answer is no.

I ran the recv-key command again and got a message about "requesting key...from hkp server pool..." but then got "HTTP fetch error 7 couldn't connect: No error" Any ideas?  -----Original Message-----

Please keep things on the list so that the most users can be helped.
You need to run the --recv-key command first, or the --verify command will continue to fail.
Try this:
gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 4F25E3B6

I tried all of the options below but still got the "HTTP fetch error 7".   I used the "sha1sum" option and got the expected result - does this verify the integrity adequately?  -----Original Message-----

Try it a few more times, you may have gotten a bad server from the pool. If it still doesn't work, try the following:
... and of course all of this assumes that the systems in question have network connectivity ...

How do you check the fingerprint? -----Original Message-----

Assuming they're all protected by https, nothing.
What does verification of that signature buy you though? That your download wasn't corrupted?
If I were to place something nefarious inside a GnuPG download, I'd sign the result with a key I created with the short key ID 4F25E3B6. That way, your --recv-key command will retrieve both my key and Werners, and the signature will happily validate. Creating a short key ID collision is peanuts and can be done with off-the-shelf software on a laptop.
This rakes in not just the people who don't check the signature, but also all those who just verify the short key ID. Since it's hardly any effort, I'd do it, even though it probably only gains me a few percent coverage.
No, but I'm also not telling people they can verify using the short key ID. No guidance is better than wrong guidance, IMHO. No offence meant, I appreciate you helping him out. I'm just trying to give some constructive criticism.
I use the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) in combination with Enigmail.
You can send me encrypted mail if you want some privacy.

@_subject: GnuPG 1.4.19 - Encryption Questions  
I installed GnuPG 1.4.19 - Command Line Only (ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32cli-1.4.19.exe 1586k)
I had existing keyrings and trustdb that I copied over to a new location.
I am now trying to encrypt a file using the "homedir" option to point to the copied keyrings but am getting this error message:
        gpg: keyblock resource '\secring.pgp' : file open error
        gpg: keyblock resource '\pubring.pgp' : file open error
I have done several Internet searches in attempt to resolve but have been unsuccessful.  Any ideas and help would be appreciated.
Also - I cannot locate the config file (gpg.conf)?  I search the server but no hits.  Is there not a config file with this version?

Thanks, Werner. I got it to work.  I had syntax errors in the gpg commands.  Question though - the gpg.conf file is optional?   If I want one I must create it?  -----Original Message-----

You better run
  gpg --version to see which directory is the default homedir of GnuPG.  You your files to that directory.  If you need a gpg.conf put it into the same directory.
Transcript error?  It should be ".gpg" and not ".pgp"
Please consider to use the installer from Gpg4win.org instead.

I am migrating PGP processing to a new server - going from GnuPG 1.4.8 to GnuPG 1.4.19.
I have a file that was encrypted using 1.4.8 and the same file encrypted from 1.4.19.  I used the FC file compare program to verify the encrypted files are the same.
However, FC is telling me the files have differences.  Is this a valid way to verify the encryption results are the same - or will they not be the same?
If not why would they be different (does the Random Seed File have anything to do with this)?
What other method can I use to validate I am getting the same results?
I am using the same Keyring on both servers and the same "Recipient" Id to do the encryption.

Yes, it is optional.  If you have more than one key it is advisable to create one and add
--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
default-key 1234567812345678
encrypt-to  1234567812345678
keyid-format long
keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net
--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---
So that gpg knows which is your default key (in this example the one with key id 1234567812345678), to which key all messages shall be encrypted in addition to the recipients (so that you can decrypt your own mails), that a keyserver shall be used, and finally to use the long keyid format.
Depending on the mail program, you need to add an encrypt-to in any case.

Random Seed File and Keyring Questions
It is my understanding that GnuPG stores a random seed file in its working directory. This file is changed each time you use GnuPG.
I have looked for more information about this file in the manual and faq, but have not found it. (There is some information in the man page.)
How is the random seed file used in encryption / decryption processing - just to generate a Key?
Can you have multiple folders containing a "set" of keyrings, trustdb, and random seed file (each folder being used for a given recipient) and then
execute gpg using the folder specific to the recipient?
Will this cause any issues?  Does it matter if you start with the same "base" random seed file in the recipient-specific folders?
