@_subject: Importing Certificates into Kleopatra in Windows 10 
Hello Jerry,
your private Key should be available already.
According to your described steps done you have imported your
secring.gpg file which should include all your private Keys.
Did you see any error or failed messages?
Maybe an import of the secring.gpg file is not possible. Have you tried
to replace the original secring.gpg file(of the new installation) with
the old file?
Best regards,
