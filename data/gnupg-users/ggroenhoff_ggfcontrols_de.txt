@_subject: W2000: GnuPG interactive 
I understood, if I use pgp without input file, I can enter the string to encrypt manually (over stdin).
But how to finish the input??
Or generally: Where can I find a manual, how to use gpg interactive?

@_subject: gpg: packet(3) with unknown version 7 
I changed to Kubuntu 18.04 and now I can't decrypt any longer a formerly
with gpg2 symmetric encrypted file. I allways get
"gpg: packet(3) with unknown version 7".
With Kubuntu 16.04 I never had problems. I assume, they changed the gpg2.
Has anyone an idea, how can I decrypt the file? It contains important data.
Many Thanks
