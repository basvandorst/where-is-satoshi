@_subject: RSA key size restriction? 
Doesn't the addition of 256 bit symmetric ciphers like AES256 and Twofish
support the case for larger public key sizes? Now the work factor is back
on the public keys.

@_subject: Signing a will with GnuPG 
Interesting. But in case anyone was wondering, this would not be valid
in the US. (at least anywhere I can think of) Most states require a lot
of hoops to jump thru for a will to be valid. (Varies by state, but
generally typed, signed, dated, may have to say certain words, signed by
two witnesses and notarized.) The only exception is a Holographic (or
Olographic if you live in a civil law system) will. In that case, it has
to be handwritten, signed, and dated by the person whose will it is.
Intent of the testator doesn't even get looked at unless they can prove
the authenticity of the document first.
