Also, PGP 8 knows to ignore the comments packets in the secret keys
generated with GnuPG, so --no-comment is no longer necessary when
exporting those keys, and PGP can now verify v4 signatures with expiration
dates on regular files (though the client UI ignores the expiration
There were a few other interop bugs I pointed out as well, but I haven't
heard if they have been fixed or not. In any case, it looks like we're a
good bit closer to seemless interoperability between PGP and GnuPG.

That is more than reasonable.
Speaking as the person who had to test the ADK vulnerability fixes for
over a dozen different platforms and multiple products, having zero lead
time for vulnerability correction makes that process rather painful.
I am a firm believer in full disclosure. However, giving a vendor a
reasonable time period in which to evaluate the threat, produce a fix, and
distribute it to customers should be standard practice.

Lots of people on this list know the speaker. I think I'm the only one who
knows the presentation, though there are many people who could give it
just as well.
You think so?
Try this experiment: Take a laptop with PGP on it and go down to your
local bar, coffee shop, cafe, etc, and attempt to explain what GnuPG is
good for, how it works, and how one uses it in 5 minutes or less to 10
random people who have never heard of PGP, and who are of "average"
computer literacy (i.e., they know how to connect to the Internet and use
email, but don't use Linux/Unix and have never compiled a program in their
How many of them will walk away understanding what you told them? Of
those, how many will become new OpenPGP users? Of those, how many will use
OpenPGP properly in a manner which will actually secure their messages?
(Note: I could just as easily be picking on almost any of the fruits of
the Cypherpunk movement. PGP is the one most attendees of LISA will have
used at some point, so that is the one I have chosen.)
GnuPG is "encryption for the crypto hackers and Linux elite.[1]" I've
never heard a mission statement from Werner, so perhaps GnuPG hasn't
failed in its mission, if this is what it was striving for. It is far from
"encryption for the masses", however, which is what Phil Zimmermann
branded PGP.
That's not to say I don't think it ever can be...
I'm not going to say anymore about this until after LISA. If you're
planning on attending, please feel free to disagree with me in the Q&A
session after my talk.
[1] Arguably not even this. I had to personally walk Eric Raymond through
using gpg to sign my key, since the --interface-was-confusing. Rodney
Thayer (one of the co-authors of the OpenPGP RFC) sends me email full of
four-letter words I didn't know existed from time to time, when he tries
to make GnuPG and PGP play nicely together. Etc.

@_subject: Rsa or Rsa Legacy with PGP 7.0 
This question is usually the other way around. GnuPG has full support for
v4 RSA keys, and while it also supports "legacy" v3 keys generated with
other programs, GnuPG itself cannot generate them.

"Very old" in this context means any version of PGP prior to 7.0,
including 6.5.8.

@_subject: rsa-e / rsa-s distinction in --version output 
"RSA" has no restrictions on it. RSA-E can only be used for encryption;
RSA-S can only be used for signing.
But the protocol does.
Yes, but you cannot create an ELG key that can only be used for signing.
(Though, you shouldn't be creating any ELG keys other than ELG-E).

@_subject: correction, Re: HushMail interoperability 
Okay, here's the deal with Hushmail and GnuPG. I've read the source for
the PGP sections of the Hushmail crypto engine. It appears from the
comments that they implemented OpenPGP based RFC2440-bis02 (the second
revision of the working draft for the RFC that will replace 2440), and did
not see the need to implement the MDC packets that are now strongly
Other implementations that support AES or Twofish, since they were
introduced at around the same time as the MDC packets, understand how to
decode the MDC packets (and, in the case of GnuPG, generate them when used
with AES or Twofish.)
The theory here was that any implementation that spoke AES would also
understand the MDC packets. Unfortunately, Hushmail uses AES without
having the MDC code in it. Therefore, it cannot decrypt messages encrypted
to it by GnuPG (though GnuPG can decrypt Hushmail messages, and Hushmail
can decrypt PGP messages). The immediate work-around is to disable MDC
packets when encrypting to a hushmail user with gpg. --disable-mdc (?).
The good news is that I've contacted Hush about this, and they've said
that the next version of Hushmail will be able to use the MDC packets.
Signing and sig verification all should work fine.
Did you read the fine print about what browsers and Java engines Hushmail
supports? (It works fine for me in IE with M$ Java. It did not work with
Sun's JRE 1.4 in IE, though it will apparently work in Netscape with JRE.)

@_subject: correction, Re: HushMail interoperability 
Not true, really. If you get them to send you their keys, you won't have
to use Hushmail's web form at all. And if you encrypt to them, just add
"--disable-mdc" to the command, or put disable-mdc in your
~/.gnupg/options file. The Hushmail user will then be able to decrypt your
messages with no problems.
(I think --disable-mdc is the right switch.)

@_subject: Problem between version 1.2.1 and hushmail.com 
This is a known issue with Hushmail. I reported it to them a few months
ago. I believe that it should be fixed in the next version of Hushmail.
For now, you can work-around by adding the --disable-mdc flag to the gpg
commandline prior to encrypting.

@_subject: elGamal Keys to Sign+Encrypt 
It depends on your CSP. A CA is making an assertion that the entity
possessing the secret key corresponding to a given public key is or has
some bit of information included in the certificate. If the public key
algorithm is too weak to reasonably trust that the private key cannot be
discovered by a third party, it is not wise to sign.
Similar logic dictates that Verisign is broken for signing 384 bit RSA SSL

And that's the problem -- everyone's arrogant from time to time. I'll go
on record, again, as saying I would really like to see ElGamal signature
support removed from OpenPGP. I believe the existence of support for such
keys, even if no major implementations now allow their use, weakens the

Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Pine is under a "non-free" license, and
the Pine authors have repeatedly rejected such patches. They have no
interest in OpenPGP support, period.
Maintaining a patch-set in parallel with pine would be a painful task.

It is fortunate then that your opinion is irrelevant to this discussion.
It is handled horribly. Show me one good plugin that supports PGP well.
PGP4Pine? pgpenvelope? I've been involved in the development/testing of
both of those for years, and they both are horrible. It is the latter that
I use, since it is the best that Pine can get us, but that doesn't mean it
is good. This is a fault not of the authors of the plugins, but of the
Pine plugin API.
A major flaw in Pine.
When did I ever say anything about pointless?
I am a Pine user. I believe Mutt to be greatly at fault for much of the
PGP/MIME issues, by their repeated propaganda attempts to convince PGP
users that inline-signatures are "old-style" or "deprecated" in favor of
the PGP/MIME format (originally devised by the author of Mutt,
surprisingly enough.)
But none of this changes the fact that the answer to Pine's problems is
*not* "go implement it yourself and it will all be better."
In order for there to be good OpenPGP/MIME support in Pine, the Pine
authors must decide there will be. There is no possibility of a fork. This
is something that is fact, and you will need to deal with if you are a
Pine user.
