@_subject: compiling gpgme with bcc 
I tried to compile gpgme using Borland C++ Compiler 5.5.
I found some errors, but got dll with modification.
Do you need any information for that?

@_subject: GNUPG, how to set the passphrase as parameter in comment line 
5) use GPGME library
I think this is the best way to "automate". I built dll, but cannot post "howto" yet, sorry.
I found,
1: to send passphrase in passphrase_cb, must not "write" to fd, use "_gpgme_io_write"
2: GPGME has some memory leak, need to free some object     debug_lock, notify_table_lock, reader_table_lock, writer_table_lock, ...
...and so on
