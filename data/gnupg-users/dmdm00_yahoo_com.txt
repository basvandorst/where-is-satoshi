@_subject: --edit-key command 
what is the command in the edit-key section to add a
missing uid to a key
for example i have been asked in this way:
Need add uid of send
    only has uid of config
a) so how to add uid of send?
Also would be nice for some unique shortname (8
characters or less)
at the moment my key has a 12 charter name
b) how to change to a unique shortname of say "pelt"?
many thanks
