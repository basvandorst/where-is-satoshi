@_subject: automatic getting keys from server 
I am using GPG 1.1.90 on Windows 2000 and everytime I verify a signature which is not in my keyring I get teh message "this key=
 is not in your keyring". This is nothing strange, but I want GPG to=
fetch the key from a keyserver. I already put the keyserver=
 address in the options file, but it still doesn't work.
any ideas?
