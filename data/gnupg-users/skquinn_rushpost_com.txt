No, that's the whole point of throw-keyids. All you're supposed to be
able to tell when using that option, is that none of your keys will
decrypt the message, so it's not for you.

@_subject: Fwd: which program use: gpg or gpgv? 
This means you do not have the correct key in pubring.gpg where the main
gpg executable is expecting it. As pubring.gpg is a zero byte file, this
is entirely to be expected. To fix this, add the appropriate keys.
The first line means there is no trustedkeys.gpg keyring. This is the
keyring that gpgv uses. Unlike the main gpg program, it assumes
everything on that keyring is a valid and fully trustable key.
Which one you decide to use to verify packages is ultimately a matter of
personal choice. If you wish to keep a separate keyring for the purpose
of verifying signatures on certain files such as software releases, then
perhaps gpgv is the better choice. If you think that's overkill and you
are content with one keyring for both correspondence and signature
verification, then the main gpg program will do. Debian itself uses gpgv
to verify updates but there is a specific reason for this, that being
that the apt and dpkg tools used by most users never need to sign or
encrypt anything, only verify signatures.

This is a bit of a "duct tape"  but you could try:
# chmod 000 `which pinentry-qt`
then reboot and see what program throws an error (besides GnuPG).
Don't forget to change it back when done testing.

@_subject: FAQ and GNU 
There is nothing political about giving proper credit to the GNU Project
for the operating system (the software which Linux, the kernel, boots
into in order to provide a useful system).
I will happily refer to, for example, Ubuntu GNU/Linux since there is
clearly a GNU userland surrounding Linux, the kernel. I feel wrong doing
I agree that it is possible to use other userlands (BSD derivatives, or
whatever Android is) with Linux, the kernel. However, the vast majority
of so-called "Linux distributions" in fact rely on GNU software (most
notably GNU coreutils and GNU libc) to function.

Maybe use gpgv2 instead and put only that one key in the trustedkeys.gpg
or trustedkeys.kbx file?

@_subject: Upgrading 2.0.20 to 2.2.24 
The format secret keys are stored in changed between 2.0.x and 2.1.x. It
is possible that 2.2.x no longer has the code in it to migrate to the
new format, in which case you might need to import secring.gpg manually
and set the trust to ultimate manually as well.

It goes back to at least 14.04, probably much farther. I haven't done
many fresh installs of the older versions. I did two fresh installs of
12.04, with everything since being upgrades (I only use LTS versions now).

@_subject: Installing a new version of GnuPG 
Back when I ran Slackware and I had to install just about anything of
substance this way, this is pretty much what I did. It's far from an
optimal way to upgrade software (occasionally, stuff needs to be deleted
that's no longer in use) but it got me by until I switched to other
GNU/Linux distributions.
Most software does not have a "make uninstall" target. That's considered
the responsibility of a package manager if you have one.

If the email address is dead, I wouldn't worry about that. I have old
keys out there with FidoNet addresses on them, as well as
cypherpunk-style remailer keys I forgot to revoke before shutting down
the remailer and wiping the system. Stuff happens.

@_subject: Syncing GnuPG data between computers 
Move your .gnupg to a thumb drive, symlink .gnupg to its mount point,
and move the thumb drive back and forth? You might have to fiddle with
permissions/ownership if your numeric uid is different on both of them,
or maybe use something like VFAT that doesn't track
ownership/permissions for better or worse.
This is what I did for my music and my music player's database, I have
not tried it with any other software including GnuPG.
