@_subject: Infere key frm plaintext and exncrypted version? 
Hash: SHA1
you probably heard this question before on this list, but
please allow me to ask again:
If someone manages to get his hands on the plain as well as
the encrypted version of the same text, does this enable him
to infere the encryption key?
And if so, does this refer to the session key only, or will
it compromise the whole PGP key?
Thanks for your expertise,
Best regards,
R=FCdiger Kupper

It might also be worth the work persuading your system administrator
of opening port 11371. To my experience, administrators usually
belong to the folk that are aware of things like PGP. They are a
good starting point if you want to convince other people at your's
to do it, too :-)

@_subject: Windows network path in gpg.conf? 
Hash: SHA1
This is one more of those never-ending Windows questions:
Is it possible to use a Windows network path in the gpg.conf file,
or does this simply not work?
I would like to distibute a conig file to a group of users, pointing
to a shared keyring on a network resource. I put in the conf file
something like:
keyring \\MyMachine\gpg-sandbox\test-pubring.gpg
This does not work. I also tried all sorts of escaped forward or
backward slashes, but nothing was of use.
I know that the network address could still be mapped to a drive
letter, but I wonder if I simply did it wrong. I'm not a Windows
networking guru.
Thanks for any comments,

If I am not mistaken, I tried all of the following:
keyring \\Machine\path\ring.gpg
keyring "\\Machine\path\ring.gpg"
keyring '\\Machine\path\ring.gpg'
keyring \\\\Machine\\path\\ring.gpg
keyring "\\\\Machine\\path\\ring.gpg"
keyring '\\\\Machine\\path\\ring.gpg'
keyring //Machine/path/ring.gpgkeyring \\Machine\path\ring.gpg
keyring "\\Machine\path\ring.gpg"
keyring '\\Machine\path\ring.gpg'
keyring "//Machine/path/ring.gpg"
keyring '//Machine/path/ring.gpg'
keyring \/\/Machine\/path\/ring.gpg
keyring "\/\/Machine\/path\/ring.gpg"
keyring '\/\/Machine\/path\/ring.gpg'
If I did not make any mistakes, nothing of the above worked.
Is, in windows, a network path handled like any "normal" filepath,
or does the program need to perform any special magic on it?
Perhaps, gpg does not do this.
(Although it is. Magic, I mean. Definitely. ;-) )

Sorry, the list in my last posting was a little screwed up by a
copy-and-paste incident.
I am sure you got the scheme, though.

@_subject: Photo-ID: questions 
Hash: SHA1
Is there some consensus on the why and how of Photo IDs?
I have one included in my key for some time now, and the image is so
outdated that I think about replacing it with a new one. So I try to
solve the following questions, and would appreciate your comments:
1. What should be the size of the picture, both, in terms of pixels,
as well as file size. GnuPG itself recommends to keep the size in
pixels close to 240x288. A 200x260 pixel JPEG portrait of myself has
a size of 16K when uncompressed, and 8K with a resonable
compression. In discussions I have read that the files size should
best not exceed 4K. Compressing my 200x260 picture to a size of 4K
or less introduces considerable compression artefacts. Should I go
with the artefacts, or should I generally use a smaller picture (in
pixels), e.g. 100x130. What arguments are there for the former or
the latter?
2. In general, should one use photo IDs at all? Do they increase
security or ease the process of key validation? Couldn't they fool
other persons into signing the key just because they recognize my
picture on it? (Anyone could download my picture from my website, so
it is no prrof at all that the key really belongs to me).
3. In addition to my portrait, I have included the jpeg of my
handwritten signature into my key (e.g. to provide a means to
validate my signature on paper documents, provided you have a
trusted copy of my GPG key). Is this a reasonable thing to do or is
it complete nonsense? Do I miss any security issue here, or does
this contradict the intended use of photo IDs? Again, anybody could
have scanned my signature from any paper document that I have
signed, so this, too, does serve as an authentication feature).
Thank you in advance for comments,

@_subject: Photo-ID: questions 
Hash: SHA1
subkeys.pgp.net is the server I uploaded my key to (including the
photo ID, as Gabriel could verify). Strange that Neil does not get it.
Anyway, your comments seem to point into the same direction that I
already concluded myself: Photo IDs have no use at all apart from
being slightly entertaining. And, as Neil pointed out, the more
personal data is included into a publicly accessible document, the
easier to abuse. I agree.
So can anyone tell a reason why one should include a photo ID into a
GPG key? And: Why is this a feature of GnuPG then?
Thanks for comments!

I already wondered why all was so quiet... I don't know the reason,
but possibly my mail provider delayed delivery :-(

license, work
The difference is that these documents are produced by a (hopefully)
trusted manufacturer (the "Bundesdruckerei" for German ID cards),
are certified by a (hopefully) trusted authority (my home city's
registry office), and are designed to be (hopefully) non-forgeable.
Public OpenPGP keys on the other hand can just be produced ,
certified and issued by anyone.
There IS a difference, and this is exactly the problem: people
making no distinction between a photo on an ID card and a photo in
an OpenPGP key.
Noticed that you can specify a picture viewer in the conf file? Or
don't you use graphics without interfaces either?
I will have to think about it ;-)

No doubt. I just wanted to illustrate the difference between
"anyone" certifying a photo, and a state doing so.
But obviously it presupposes that the state itself is trustworthy,
which might not be true for all states. Perhaps not even a single
one. You're right.
