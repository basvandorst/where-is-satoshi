@_subject: Problems with HTTP_PROXY 
I?ve written about my Proxy Problems some weeks ago, but don?t get any As long as all available docs and other help (mozilla and enigmail newsgroups) can?t help (all settings seem to be right). I still can?t connect via the PROXY. Is there anything special about the Ports?
Thank you,

@_subject: GPG via Proxy =?iso-8859-1?q?isn=B4t_working?= 
Hello I?m Trying to use GnuPG over an HTTP_PROXY But it isn?t working, over the direct RAS access (local) it works but not via the Proxy.
I?ve setted the "HTTP_PROXY" Variable in my "Autoexec.bat".
SET HTTP_PROXY=192.168.1.10:80
And have the following "gpg.conf"
keyserver-options honor-http-proxy auto-key-retrieve include-subkeys
GnuPG is installed in C:\Programme\GnuPG and the Path is entered in the "PATH" in my "Autoexec.bat".
SET PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND;c:\Perl\bin;
          C:\PROGRA~1\ATITEC~1\ATICON~1;C:\F-PROT;
          C:\Programme\GemeinsameDateien\GIS;C:\watcom\BINNT;
          C:\watcom\BINW\Tools;C:\Novell\Client32;C:\watcom\BINW;
          C:\PROGRA~1\GEMEIN~1\ULEADS~1\MPEG;
          C:\PROGRA~1\GRISOFT\AVG6;c:\progra~1\gemein~1\gtk\2.0\bin;
          C:\Progra~1\GnuPG
I?m using Windows98SE German Language the Sambar Proxy and the Sygate Personal Firewall on my Server.
Sambar works as HTTP_PROXY on Port 80
Sygate allows only outgoing connections for Sambar on all Ports and all Protocolls no incomming smtp is allowed. inthe intranet is everythin for everyone allowed.
what can I do to make it work?
Thank you.

Are there any future Plans for implementing full Proxy Support?
I now tried since more than a Year but it wont work. Still the last Version 1.3.92 didn?t work.
