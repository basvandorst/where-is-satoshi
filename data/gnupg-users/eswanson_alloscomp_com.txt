@_subject: Import "Raw" RSA Secret Key? 
Hash: SHA256
Hello all,
I'm trying to import a "raw" RSA secret key into GnuPG.
I have p, q, d and the creation timestamp, as well as anything else
that can be computed from them (n, u, e, etc etc).
I've been implementing bits of RFC 4880 in an attempt to generate
valid secret key files, but it looks like GnuPG won't import a key
unless it has a valid self-signature, and that chunk of the
specification is large and looks painful to implement.
So how can I best get my (p,q,d,timestamp,n,u,e) structure into a
valid GPG key which can be used to sign, encrypt, etc messages?
Best regards,
