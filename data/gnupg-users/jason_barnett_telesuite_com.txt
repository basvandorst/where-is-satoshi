My apologies for responding to this thread instead of starting a new
one, but I need to do this as a reply for a test.
I am a member of another newsgroup (php.general) where I regularly post
messages and sign them.  However, I have noticed that some of my
messages will sign correctly while others do not.  I use Thunderbird 1.0
with Enigmail 0.90.1.1 to post / read messages from that server.  So my
question is: is this really a news server error or a bug in my news reader?

I suppose it would be a better test if I had actually signed my

I know, I know.  I've just started using GPG and don't have anyone in my
web of trust yet... still working on that part :)
Yep... my message gets signed correctly.
I didn't know those existed.  I have posted messages to several
newgroups, but if you tell me which group(s) are out there for this
purpose I will gladly try that.
I *was* doing everything through my newsreader; I will try that as well.
Absolutely!  When I first set everything up my first tests were emails
to myself to see if I created good signatures.  I even tested encryption
to make sure that encrypted messages went through ok, and finally I sent
messages that were both encrypted *and* signed to myself to see if those
checked out ok... which they did.
Yes, strange I know.  I had someone on the Enigmail mailing list suggest
that the news server and/or my reader might be adding an extra period
after the ellipses.  Now mind you I don't know who the culprit is, but I
did notice this behavior on several of the failed-signature messages.
So, I wrote here in the hopes of testing whether it's a reader issue or
a server issue.

This makes sense (wish I had read this before my last message to this
group!).  I have been using PGP/MIME rather than clear-signed messages
all along.
Yeah, yeah.

Although I have read through the man page as well as a few web sites, I am still quite new to GPG.  I searched a bit and found this newsgroup and hope that you folks can help me with these questions.
- Can someone give me some advice on how to get started building my "web of trust?"  I think I understand the basic concept; meet someone in real life, verify they are who they say they are and exchange signatures. But can someone give me some practical tips to get started?  (BTW I live in southwest Ohio, USA).
- Is there a site where I can search *all* of the archives at once?  I found  but I can only search within a one month time frame (and I hate to post questions that have already been answered).
- I realize that not every person I email is going to use GPG / PGP so I'd like to at least sign every email that I send.  What exactly is supposed to be in my signature?  Is it the encrypted version of the email I am sending?
Thanks in advance for whatever help you can send my way.  And if any of you are PHP developers feel free to drop me a line some time.  :)

After I wrote this I thought of one other question.  I submitted my first public key to several keyservers (you can find it by going to    As I understand it one person will often use multiple private keys (perhaps one for personal, one for work, one for when you get fired and start working somewhere else).
- Should I create a personal key and use that as my "primary" private key... and then assign other keys as "secondary" keys as needed?
I'm asking this mostly from a management perspective.  I understand how to do what I'm asking, I'm just asking if my line of thinking is correct or if I should be managing my keys in some other way.  Thanks again!

Someone else emailed me off list and I'm signing up for that right now.
No one in my family uses it (I'm actually trying to convince my sister to start), but I'll give my friends a try.
Thanks for the tip!  I've done this before for other sites, but I just didn't think of it this time around.
I downloaded / installed it.  I'll be setting that up shortly.
Many, many good tips here.  Thank you!

Thank you for this tip.  Now I need to go find my local GLUG and ask them what filesystem format to use on the USB... I currently am using Windows machines, but next time I get a new computer at home (which will be relatively soon) I'm not even going to bother with MS anymore.  At least not more than I have to.  :-/
