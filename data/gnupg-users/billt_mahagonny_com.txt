Perhaps you should amend that to the perfect Linux GUI mailer to keep the Mutt Maniacs at bay Sylpheed support for GnuPG is still under hot debate and very beta. Check out the Sylpheed and Sylpheed-Claws mailing lists to get into the action. Currently, the GPG support is limited to PGP/MIME encryption and decryption. Plain Text ASCII encryption and decryption needs to be handled
outside of the Sylpheed program. I have also had some problems verifing some signatures from some mailers, but I have not been able to pin down the exact cause. However I was able to verify the MIME signature on Ken Wahl's rely to you with no

I am using Sylpheed and I love it, but there are some hoops to jump through for GPG support. Specifically sending and receiving plain-text ASCII armored encryption. I would also suggest taking a look at Mulberry ( It's not free (in any sense of the word) but it is

Does anyone have a suggestion on integrating GnuPG into VIM? I was hoping
to find a pre-existing VIM plugin, but a quick search on the VIM page
didn't come up with any. Since I am by nature a lazy man I thought I would
ask here next :)

But I got you to do my Google search for me, didn't I?
Seriously though, I had checked Google as well and found that link and
some others in the same vein. What I was hoping to find was a plug-in or
script that would do encryption and verification as well as decryption.
Something like TKpgp, but using vi.
Oh well, I'll keep looking or work on something myself when I get time.

First, take a look at TkPGP
an oldie but a goodie that still works with the latest GnuPG.
However, if you are using Sylpheed, the latest versions of Sylpheed and
Sylpheed-Claws finally support ASCII armored signatures and encryption.
Feel free to contact me off list if you need the specific Sylpheed account

@_subject: Signature in Attachment 
Sorry Don, but to my knowledge the only solution to use PGP/Mime with
Outlook or Outlook Express is the commercial PGP software. M$ has set-up
the Outlooks so that they munge PGP/MIME attachments and you can not add
additional MIME types without a plug-in of some kind.
Good Luck,

@_subject: gpgme and signature comments 
Hash: SHA1
This may be a shot in the dark, but is anyone else having issues with
adding comments to a GPG ascii signature when signing through gpgme? I would like to add a comment to my e-mail sigs when signing with my mail
program (Sylpheed-Claws) which uses gpgme. As seen below, the comment does
not appear. However when I sign a file with gpg directly the comment
appears as normal. At first I thought that the issue was caused by
Sylpheed, but the developers there have pushed the blame to gpgme. Is this
really an issue and if so is there any way around it?

I understand the problems with in-line signatures, but unfortunately many
of the people I send e-mail to use M$ Outlook and Outlook Express. Outlook
Express treats PGP/MIME signatures as "hostile attachments" and will not
let OE users open them by default. The MS Office version of Outlook hides
the signature attachment as a dat file. At least with an ASCII signature
the recipient can see the signature and read the e-mail no matter how
broken their MUA is.
Is there a better answer to the compatibility issue? Should I just stop
signing messages altogether? What are other people doing?

Unfortunately I believe the answer is don't use Outlook. Outlook and
Outlook express do not recognize PGP/MIME formatted attachments. Neither
program allows you to add mime-types to the system, so you are stuck with
in-line signatures or nothing.
This has been an ongoing problem for me as well, so please feel free to
correct me if I'm wrong.

Can you elaborate on this? How recent is your information? I have

no current restriction to using cryptography, ether GnuPG or IPsec

Yes, but if you want to remain anonymous what is the point of
cryptographically signing your e-mail? You can't have it both ways.

I think that the PGP "web of trust" may be better suited to this that
X509/CA's due to the fact that many signatures can be added to one key.
In the CA model, there is one authority that all certificates refer to. In
the PGP model, a single key can be signed by several local authorities, one
of which should be close enough to the key owner for them to trust the
I know that the next step in the argument is how can you trust the chain?
If I sign Alice's key, and she signs Bob's key, does that mean I now trust
everything signed by Bob?
Due to the way trust is established with PGP, this is not necessarily so.
Each key can be assigned a level of trust, so that I can designate Alice's
as fully trusted, and validate Bob's key, but I can set my trust
preference for Bob at a lower level so that I do not automatically trust a
key he has signed.
This is quite a bit of work for the end user and would probably lead to
people trusting a key that they shouldn't, but that is where we are now
with CA's. At least with the PGP model, the user can personally validate
sections of the trust chain and has some control over the degree of trust
they put into sections of the chain they have not personally valdated,
unlike the single authority x509/CA model.
