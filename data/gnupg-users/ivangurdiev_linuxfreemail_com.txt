@_subject: Keyserver question - key id 
I apologize if this is an ignorant question... I have little knowledge of keyservers  I attempted to export 2 gpg keys to the wwwkeys.pgp.net keyserver.
One of the id's however was changed - I searched the keys online.
When exported, the key id translates back to the original.
I thought it's the keyserver's way of handling duplicate id's but I am not sure if that's true.
The result is: since there is no such key ...correct id is 1D51605D. Changed to 1AA20E95 as shown below.
How do I resolve this problem?
search results...wwwkeys.pgp.net online
Look at the second key and sig.
