 which is kind of broken, because the site's
certificate is untrusted due to an incomplete certificate chain.
Are you aware of that?

We both know that almost nobody installs additional certificates.
So why don't just get a proper certificate like for gnupg.org with a
complete trust path?
Btw: Also the TLS configuration of wiki.gnupg.org is not as good as the
one for gnupg.org (e.g. support for TLS 1.2), see
