You need to make use of the idea of procmail filter rules.
For example, I use a rule like this to adjust the Subject line of
mail from the full-disclosure mailing list:
 full-disclosure
* ^List-Id:.*full-disclosure.lists.grok.org.uk
        # filter delivered mail's subject line for better mutt sorting
        :0hfW
 sed -e '/^Subject: / s/\[Full-disclosure\] //'
        # send to proper mailbox
        :0
        full-disclosure
The above was copied from a working setup.  You'll need to do some testing
and playing around, but extrapolating from my above rule, I'd likely
try something like this:
# send body of email through a gpg filter, and make sure it succeeds
Hope that helps,
- Chris
