@_subject: gpg not running in shell script.  Need Help 
I need help in running gpg command through shell script in Informatica.
This is what I tried
I have a shell script which will decrypt the file. It is running fine when I ran the same script from $ prompt in Unix. The same is not running when I ran through Informatica as a command. I also initialized the PATH session in the script. But nothing is working.
Am I missing any thing? Appreciate any help.
Shell Script content
. /home/apinf/.profile
PATH=$PATH:/pwrctr/siva/ ; export PATH
cd $DIR
echo "Decrypt Started"
echo "Password" | gpg -v --passphrase-fd 0 /pwrctr/siva/GEINDSYS.cyc.pgp echo "Decrypt Successful"
