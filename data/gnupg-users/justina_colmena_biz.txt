Hello GnuPG users!
This is somewhat related to a discussion from last month.
 To answer the question about GnuPG on Android, the most useful application I have found so far is called OpenKeychain.
The K-9 Mail client, which I am using now, and a password store utility both make good use of OpenKeychain on Android.
I was able to create a key (see URL at the bottom of this email signature for public key), back it up, import it into GnuPG 1.4.23 and use it successfully, but I am unable to use the private key in GnuPG 2.2.9, because I cannot verify the pass phrase for the private key on gpg2 no matter what I do.
I have signed this email with the key in question, for reference.

@_subject: Garbled data in keyservers 
A keyserver is a convenience. Of course it's not magic. Right now I am using K-9 Mail and OpenKeychain on Android. When I received the above message from the list, K-9 Mail informed me that it was signed with a key with fingerprint "0xff80ae9d1dec358d", and referred me to the OpenKeychain app, which searched keyservers and found a matching public key, which I was allowed to import to verify the signature, which I did so successfully.
The fingerprints are some collision-resistant secure hashes, and in theory it is extraordinarily difficult to create another public key with the same fingerprint.
I have never met "Werner Koch" personally, but I am about as certain as I can be (under the present scheme of things) that that is the key fingerprint of the person from GnuPG.org who posts to the mailing list, and that there would be quite a bit of noise on the list in case of a mistaken identity.
There is a certain "reputation effect" with a public key which in theory obviates the need for in-person verification and secret handshakes.
The major difficulties and points of weakness to the whole scheme, in my opinion, are, (a) retaining possession of the private key, and (b) denying others illicit access to the private key.
Point (b) is a long-term, seemingly irremediable, problem. The long key lifetimes and the general lack of *Perfect Forward Secrecy* greatly aggravate the risk of a catastrophic total compromise of all data signed with or encrypted to the private key.

This attachment is an encrypted backup I made from the OpenKeychain app of a test key I made for the purpose. The passphrase for this one is
but it looks like the whole thing is encrypted by symmetric-key (AES-256) cipher because it is not encrypted to any particular public key, and furthermore, once decrypted and imported, the secret key is no longer protected by a passphrase, until I explicitly create one for it with "gpg --edit-key".
For some odd reason I am unable to use the secret key in gpg2 (~2.2.11), even though I can still encrypt to the imported key or verify signatures with it in gpg2.
There does not seem to be any problem with using the secret key in "gpg" = GnuPG 1.4.23.

That's a bit steep, and was never the original goal of PGP or GPG.
If the goal is to eliminate the bulk of bad keys and junk from key servers, an account creation with basic email verification for adding or removing keys should suffice.
Let's be honest: no one really wants an infrastructure of legally valid or enforceable GPG signatures, either. It's a technical verification that something is very unlikely to be altered if the signature is valid. Any particular overriding legal significance beyond that is unnecessary.
Don't overdo it, please. PGP key servers are not supposed to be "authoritative." They are a convenience to extend an informal web of trust. Let's resist that German urge toward authoritarianism and absolutism, shall we?
Bosses and bullies do not help with privacy, personal digital signatures, or cryptography for personal use. The CA stuff is mostly for business, not personal. The adversaries in that case are pickpockets and credit card skimmers, not major governments and political enemies.

What was that German company, StartSSL or something, that offered free certs for a while, big on S/MIME, (almost deprecated PGP/GPG,) and personal client certificates on the browser, that sort of thing?
Then there was a big kerfuffle because the Chinese allegedly bought them out.
Then EFF / certbot / letsencrypt started offering them. It's a "gentleman's agreement" of sorts. One and only one CA will offer "free" certs, and they're "well-known," basically for development and not for e-commerce.
I'm rather upset with EFF at the moment, by the way. They're always pushing "adult content" like a bunch of porno addicts and they have acquired almost a Salesforce- or SAP-like CRM system in their back office, collecting lot of personal information on political dissidents and precisely the privacy-minded individuals who would rather not have such possibly derogatory information collected about them.

One disadvantage of "keyservers" in general is that the automated queries to them leak "too much information" on the parties with whom one is communicating - even the fact that one is using PGP at all.
One of the original goals of PGP, and later on, GnuPG, was to avoid the reliance on a central point of failure such as a "server." It was to be a most explicitly *decentralized* system.
*Probably nothing wrong* with a keyserver if the key is tied to one's everyday real-life identity, but that is not always the use case of public key cryptography. Not everyone wants his or her phone number, email address, and residence address published in a database accessible to the public.
The big advantage, of course, to the keyservers is that they make it convenient for people to use PGP and GnuPG who might not otherwise bother with encryption at all.
In any case, I am sure that the keyserver support functionality could easily be split off into a separate program if it is being dropped from GnuPG, which to be honest is getting rather bloated and could do well to focus on its core competencies.
Right now the OpenKeychain app on my phone is configured to search OpenPGP keyservers:
hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net (hkp://jirk5u4osbsr34t5.onion)
hkps://keys.fedoraproject.org (which I added because I use Fedora.)
There is also a "keybase.io" and a "Web Key Directory" search. It might seem a bit much, but the general goal here is not "absolute privacy" but to enable the dumb user of a smart phone to make use of PGP encryption.
This whole debate, I seem to recall, took place many, many years ago, and of course different groups have different goals and find different technical solutions for their respective situations.

A permanent record and a mug shot for the cops and every thief, hooker, and pickpocket on the block, respectively. And they all just help themselves to the secret key.

@_subject: Smart cards 
I agree that smartphones are not safe, but I am not particularly in favor of smartcards, dongles, and security tokens like yubikeys, either.
Any kind of special-purpose cryptographic *hardware* is essentially proprietary, and too attractive and soft a target for various nations' spy agencies to covertly backdoor. "Don't look at me! I've got something to hide, and nowhere to protect it!"
There's a secure phone on the President's desk, and not even the Secret Service can say it's all that "secure."
Open-source cryptographic software that runs on general purpose computer hardware is generally much more difficult to backdoor.
If you plug some little doohickey or thingamagig into your computer to do *crypto*, of all things, your computer is liable to become infected with spyware over the USB bus via BadUSB and various firmware- and device-related security vulnerabilities.

This e-mail is signed with a key generated by OpenKeychain on a smartphone. I am able to verify the signatures on other signed e-mails I get on this mailing list, with the exception of the footer added by the mailing list software.
I was able to back up the key, import it into GnuPG 1.4.23 and sign some old papers which I had sitting around, with the same key, which ironically is now newer than any of the papers. I have made both attached and detached signatures.
OpenKeychain on my smartphone is able to verify the attached signatures .gpg, but not the detached .sig files.
For some reason I cannot get GnuPG 2.2.11 to recognize the passphrase for the secret key, which I am only able to set, use, or change in GnuPG 1.4.23.
MAIN QUESTION: Is this a pinentry-curses problem with the tty over ssh, or is it an actual key incompatibility issue?
If for some reason the key is not actually compatible with GnuPG 2, then shouldn't I just generate a new key in GnuPG 2, and then sign it with my old key in GnuPG 1 and also import it back into the OpenKeychain app if I want to use it on my phone?
Thank you. There is quite a discussion going on about other matters, and I am not sure I asked the right question for what I wanted to know.

For some reason I'm not getting a "Reply-To:" for the whole list here...
Hidden recipients are normally given in the BCC (Blind Carbon Copy) field in the case of email, and the communication paths are not disclosed to other recipients.
Shouldn't an email message (for example) be encrypted separately to each BCC recipient, or is this an intended all-in-one multiple-recipient encryption which cannot conceal from the cryptanalyst the fact that the same message, encrypted only once, is being sent to more than one receiving party?
I hate to see the vast number of gpg command-line options get so carried away that we lose grip of the basic cryptography that we want to use GnuPG for.
And now the *secret* keys are going in "~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg" with the false implication by its name that the file contains only public keys which need not be so carefully guarded against disclosure.

I don't mean to sound rude or out of place, but there appear to be too many distractions to have a productive discussion on this list, and there are some critical issues, because GnuPG has become an essential part of many important systems throughout the free and open source software community.
The weekly "digest" option for the mailing list should be no-reply. People who wish to participate in a pointed or on-topic discussion really need to receive each email message independently.
I realize it's a German domain, but 300baud.de is just really obnoxious in English. The phrase "300 baud" itself is, of course, completely unobjectionable hacker lore, but baud+de = "bawdy" as in "bawdy house" which is extremely vulgar in English. Only for the gentlemen.
That sort of "humor" is not friendly to women and children, and I know especially a lot of women and girls would otherwise be very interested in cryptography, PGP-encrypted email, etc. Let's lose the vulgarity and focus on Alice's secret message to Bob, something Eve or Mallory has no need to know, basic elements of what needs to be done right with respect to the core functionality of GnuPG.
Not to advertise, but my own domain is the Spanish word "colmena" (hive, colony of bees, beehive in English) with the "biz" tld, slang for "business." Bees are busy, and they make that buzzing noise. Point being, it's entirely possible to avoid a lewd implication or double entendre. I can't let people take me for all honey and no sting with my domain.
With regards to PGPfone etc., all you need to do is run Asterisk on a server somewhere, enable SIP with encryption. If you or your conversation partner don't have a public key, there is a voice verification of endpoints, but do note that encrypted real-time voice conversations are extremely difficult to protect from packet-timing and other side-channel attacks which often trivially reveal a muffled but clear recording and transcript.
The human voice is in a certain sense "too rich" to hide or conceal, and the Bible tells of a "line" of every signal or sound that extends to be heard to the ends the earth, and of the ungodly that "the sound of his words shall come unto the Lord for the manifestation of his wicked deeds."

I am definitely not asking anyone to install anything for my use. I'm just trying to explain AFAIK, what you need to do if you want to experiment with voice encryption.
I don't want to be held responsible for it or arrested for it any more than anyone else, and I'm also trying to explain how some of these things come across to authorities who continually amd repeatedly insist on viewing all such matters in the worst possible light.
Didn't Martin Luther say to place the best construction on all things? But no, we must submit to "parallel construction" and falsely sworn warrants by over-informed and under-educated law enforcement officers. "Thou shalt not bear false witness" and all that, and we just had a holiday, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. day - and that's right, now that I think about it - not only a doctorate like his German namesake, but his father and grandfather and their wives must have been staunch Lutherans as well, in so far as to name one son after another after him.
There is so much Catholic insistence on communist totalitarianism under a papal dictatorship of the proletariat, and opposition in the name of that religion to every precept of human rights and due process of law, that even the Finnish Protestants preach "oikeutta" & "lain oikeaa k?ytt??" in church, because like us they have not attained to such rights and freedoms in this life on Earth, and so the struggle continues against Catholicism.
The full name of "baud" is "Baudot," a Frenchman, if I recall correctly, a contemporary of Hartley or Shannon, definitely a co-worker on such matters. Living relatives? Is it another family feud? France is practically at war already with a migrant situation, the recent Europol or Interpol shake-up with China or Russia or South Korea, general E.U. upheaval, Brexit sympathies, and so on and so forth.

The official answer to NAT is IPv6. Works quite well, except for a few technology luddites.
Other than that, my place was SWATted about 1:30am last night. The previous night the phone rang at 4:38am, caller ID from Washington, D.C. A strange car had been parked at my place, listening for the phone to ring.
We've got to think outside the box on that one. There's a German pub down the street, the "West Berlin," just across from the local telephone office, GCI, yes, luddites, all NAT, no IPv6. Gotta go AT&T for that.
So think reality: location, location, location. It's S.O.P. for the C.C.C., and no, we're not talking about the Civilian Conservation Corps.

[[[Date: Tuesday, February 5, 2019, 12:45 PM AKST]]]
PGP signatures do have a couple of rather severe and vicious limitations.
THE DATE PROBLEM. Only the body of the email is signed, not the envelope headers, namely the subject and intended recipients, and probably most importantly, the date. It would be nice to have an option to automatically include some of these headers in the body of the signed message when composing a signed email message.
THE STRIPPING PROBLEM. Currently, each attachment is signed separately and independently by the PGP-MIME standard. It would be preferable to digitally sign SHA hashes of the main message and all attachments in a single additional attachment. This would leave an indication of any attachments that may have been "stripped" from the email message, but without breaking the signatures of remaining attachments in such cases.
Bust that 55+ EFF nightclub and do it right, folks, unless it's the youth wing spouting the exact same old fogies' party line. ....

News media questions?
Many times it is the case that large files are compresssed before being encrypted, and there are certain information-theoretical reasons to do so.
Aside from efficiency and possibly a slightly better security, it is absolutely impossible to compress files after they are encrypted because the repetitive or redundant patterns, on which the compression is based, are precisely what is obfuscated and concealed by the encryption.
In any case, if the file was compressed before encryption, then it will have to be expanded back to its original size after decryption.
Then there is the base64 ASCII armor, which causes a ciphertext expansion to the tune of some 35% by using only 6 of the 8 bits of each byte plus extra formatting for new lines and such.
So how did the Firstlook Media reporters from The Intercept come to give up their GPG keys and go so mainstream corporate? They never got along all that well with the military, and they're not even remotely "alternative" anymore if they ever were. It's all establishment Democrat party line mainstream media, and "Don't you dare try to get smart and buck the labor union!" Holed up in Brazil somewhere pushing that atrocious "7me" spyware app on my Android phone as if that gay male reporter is suddenly a good Christian sitting on the church pew keeping the Sabbath so obediently on the Seventh Day and circumcising his kids under the law of Moses.
That's why I have to call foul play on proprietary operating systems. Encryption is theoretical only: in practice useless, moot, crippled, broken, and terminally back-doored with all the malware, adware, spyware, worms, viruses, trojans, keyloggers, and screenscrapers inherent to such systems as Google Android, Microsoft Windows, and Apple OS. The Democrats will stop at nothing to keep it that way at all costs, and the Republicans just don't care.

This seems like better practice. Also I would want to encrypt the transmitted email message only to the intended recipient, and the copy stored in my "Sent" folder only to myself.
I am not terribly comfortable with this situation. It almost seems rather creepy to me to receive an encrypted message that is also encrypted for the benefit or verification of one or more unknown and unidentified third parties. I start suspecting things like a foreign government mandated key escrow or secret government backdoor on behalf of some foreign spy or law enforcement agency.

It's a peculiar problem with which law enforcement is of little or no assistance. There's a gun and a badge and a gang of dicks with flashlights all over town, and a heavy-breathing warrant to bust your door in on that stuff. Neither the law enforcement credentials nor the color of law excuse the base human desire of cops to indulge their own flesh.
A related problem is "image phreaking." People make a game of digitally altering images and obscuring their source. Others make a game of deobfuscating the images and tracking them down. There is a very close-knit community of this sort of thing among disreputable hangers-on to Interpol, Europol, US FBI, Russian FSB, etc.
Several times I have been forced to permanently dissociate myself from all images and photos ever to have been associated with me, whether photos I have taken myself or which were found on my computer. Those people were hunting me, and they were led astray by their false assumptions, because *I* usually assume when foreign cops are hunting me that they are hunting to kill, and not to bring criminal or civil charges in court.
Wherever there is a photo or image of any sort, cops as well as a certain low-class security apparatchik always _assume_ an unhealthy obsession or morbid desire to memorialize something or someone. I mean, if you're not a professional photographer, you are _assumed_ to be trespassing on their intellectual property in some way or another, however they can twist it around in court to make it appear so. It's all part and parcel of the artsy-fartsy red-light district with the FBI warnings on all the Hollywood movies, actresses accusing male fans of stalking, etc.
So digital photos and images become a cop-calling feminists' emotional space where men in general and less privileged women are prohibited by law, but professional necktied gentlemen are perfectly welcome.

Yes, I agree it's about time somebody clocked the $ out of some of these EFF f*ckers and called them out on their bull crap, because you're not one of them, as you have so excused yourself.
Other than that, well, all we ever get from Gnu/EFF is, "Don't talk to the cops!" And come to find out they have already snitched on us, grossly misrepresented us to the aforementioned cops, and cooked up false police reports against us that go on permanent record without the due process of law, and without any communication to us of our loss of rights and representation.
We would like to work with the cops and educate them on due process and civil rights, but the truth is, you're either a criminal or a snitch the minute you talk to a cop, they punish you just the same either way, all the dishonest lawyers, corrupt judges, and stacked juries on their side, and if you haven't "lost your gun rights" already, they just take you in for a mental evaluation and have a doctor declare you irrevocably incompetent to possess a firearm for the rest of your life of cop-calling victimhood.
And it's actually ten times worse than that, because when you try to find employment or housing with that on your record, your potential employer sees an unfounded and unproven, but indefeasible accusation of murder on your permanent record.
