@_subject: Search: Applikation to encrypt on the fly 
I am looking for an application the surveys a folder, and once I drop a
file there it is being encrypted with my GPG key. The background is, that I
want to use folder to be synced with a remote location (dropbox). And I
just want to be shure the files are encrypted on the fly.
Anyone knows one?
