@_subject: [Announce] Pinentry 0.9.5 released 
Hello Group,
I have been experimenting with installing GnuPG from scratch and also by
using the Debian packages.
I am currently running Debian "Stretch" with experimantal added to get
me GnuPG 2.1.4:
deb  stretch main contrib non-free
deb-src  stretch main contrib non-free
# experimental sources in order to get latest vertion of GnuPG
deb  experimental main
Now that we have a new version of Pinentry, I would like to try
installing from scratch since the Debian package is currently only at
version 0.9.4-2.
I noticed when I tried to install the Debian package, (sudo apt-get
install pinentry) it tells me there are several variations:
Package pinentry is a virtual package provided by:
  pinentry-tty 0.9.4-2
  pinentry-qt4 0.9.4-2
  pinentry-gtk2 0.9.4-2
  pinentry-gnome3 0.9.4-2
  pinentry-curses 0.9.4-2
  mew-beta-bin 7.0.50~6.7~rc1+0.20150513-1
  mew-bin 1:6.6-3
You should explicitly select one to install.
So I used "sudo apt-get install pinentry*"
in order to get them all. Was this correct?
Does the available tar-ball have all of these too?
Now I want to install pinentry-0.9.5.
In the past I downloaded all of the tar-balls (GnuPG, Libgpg-error,
Libgcrypt, etc) to a folder in my home directory which I named
"Software" I then unpacked them, cd'ed in to each directory and then ran
"./configure, make, make install)
I'm older and wiser now. Should I unpack the Pinentry-0.9.5.tar.bz2 in
to the /usr/local folder and then perform the ./configure,make,make
install steps?
How would I put the libraries in /usr/local/lib and the headers in
installation? (naive assumption)
(Sorry if this question is more Debian related than GnuPG related, but
it is the application I'm trying to install)

Hello Group,
Well here I go again. I'm forever tweaking my OS. I was using a dual
boot Kali/Debian Jessie (encrypted). Somehow (I think when I updated
Debian) my Kali partition became corrupted. I tried to reinstall Kali
and destroyed my Debian partition. Live and learn. That is just
Unfortunately, the experimental version of GnuPG 2.1.4 that I had
bungled my way into (with much help from this group) was wiped clean as
So I figured I would start fresh. I added experimental to my sources
list and then attempted:(as per dkg's weblog on Debian Administration)
sudo apt install -t experimental gnupg2 gnupg-agent dirmngr gpgsm gpgv2
This worked for me before, but now I was getting a lot of dependency
related errors. I recalled that the first time I had tried
unsuccessfully to install 2.1.4 from scratch (before being directed to
experimental). So I figured I would install all of the latest libraries
and try again. So I downloaded all of the libraries, verified them, and
installed them, in order, with ./configure; make; make install:
as Per Warner in the read me:

                            libgcrypt
                        (ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/)

@_subject: Installing GnuPG 2.1.4 in Debian Experimental 
It is my understanding that the best way to install Debian packages is indirectly using apt-get install. However, when I tried that with:
"apt-get install libassuan0? It kept telling me ?package is up to date? and my attempt to install GnuPG from experimental continued to fail.
Although I downloaded and verified all of the original packages from the GnuPG website:
 in my haste, I dowloaded the libassuan0 (2.2.1-1) package directly from
the Debian Package website:
 I blatantly disregarded their warning:
?if you are running Debian, it is strongly suggested to use a package manager like aptitude  or synaptic  to download and install packages, instead of doing so manually via this website."
I addition to that, although the site is ?https? and looks ?official? enough,
there are no hashes or signatures provided.
So essentially I solved my problem in the short term by installing assuan 2.2.1-1
At this point my concern is:
1) I have dowloaded and installed software that I was unable to verify.
2) I have taken a shortcut with my Debian release(stable) that might cause issues if I run an update.
Moving to ?stretch? seems the most strait-forward
way of achieving my goal of running GnuPG version 2.1.x. But doen't that also automatically download and install ?testing? versions of other packages that I am not interested in?
Will running "apt-get install update && apt-get install dist-upgrade?
on my system, in it?s current state, overwrite libassuan0 with an earlier version?
Is it too late to try to move to ?stretch??
Thank you for all of your help in this matter. I know we are drifting in to territory that would be more appropriate in a delian-users mailing list.
