@_subject: Recursive Encryption 
Hello GNUpg users and freedom loving people across the world!
I want to use gnupg from the command line to encrypt many directories and
files. I thought the easiest way to do this would be to instruct gnupg to
perform this function recursively, but I can't find info at gnupg.org that
shows how this can be done and the man pages say nothing about the matter.
Could someone point me to a source of information that describes how to go
about this. It is possible... isn't it?
Thank you all.

@_subject: Email Focus 
I have read the information at openpgp.org. I found it very interesting,
but it left me wondering _why_ openpgp is used primarily for email when it
can be (and is) used for many other things. I like using GNUpg, but I
seldom ever use it for email. I use GNUpg to encrypt files (lots of
files), and the encryption works well, but it is not as user-friendly or
as easy for this purpose as it is for email. For instance, I posted the topic about recursive directory encryption a
few days ago. GNUpg doesn't have this ability. I would love to be able to
gpg -e -s -u Richard --Recursive Name_Of_Directory. Under Windows2000, I
use PGPFreeware and it performs recursive encryption. Why can't GNUpg do
the same?
Here are the facts: I've been on the list for several months now, and have
found it very helpful... although much of it is over my head (I do not
program, I administer Linux systems and occasionaly write shell scripts).
I run Linux servers and Windows desktops. GNUpg works great on Linux. PGP
works better on Windows. I would like to see GNUpg used more widely as I
strongly agree with open-source, but I have to admit that much of
open-source is _not_ designed for the average office worker who finds it
difficult to use MS Word.

The second option is better. I don't want to untar, decompress, and then
decrypt. That's what I'm doing with tar now.

I copyed my /.gnupg to another Linux PC. Now, when I try to encrypt on the new PC, this is what I see:
gpg -e filename
You did not specify a user ID. (you may use "-r")
Enter the user ID:
When I enter my idea gpg says: No such user ID
Can someone help me to understand this?

@_subject: Revocation 
Hello freedom loving GNUpg users!
I have a revoke.asc file in case something should ever happen to my secret
key. Is it a good idea to encrypt the revoke.asc file? Could encrypting it
with the key it is meant to revoke cause problems? I store revoke.asc in
my .gnupg directory. I do not want to print it out on paper.
Thank you

@_subject: GPG permissions 
Hello GNU freedom loving people of the world!
When moving a users .gnupg directory to another Redhat GNU/Linux system, I use
these permissions and have found them to work very well:
.gnupg		700
options		664
pubring.gpg	664
randon_seed	600
secring.gpg	600
trustdb		664
If you are having problems moving the .gnupg directory to another
GNU/Linux system, take a look at the permission levels, and be sure that
the owner and group corresponds with the correct user.

If this is in the faq, please forgive me.
How well does GNUpg encrypt entire hdds or whole partitions? I have lots of senetive material spread out over several partitions and several drives. I think it would be easiest and fastest if I could just encrypt all the hard drives instead of trying to encrypt the indiviudal files and directories. Has anyone here had experience doing this?

Hello All,
I revoked some keys and sent them to the key servers several months ago. I checked the key servers today, and noticed that the revoked keys are still there. They show that they have been revoked of course, but my question is: how long do key servers keep revoked keys? Aren't these keys useless?
I also have a couple of keys that are still active, but I don't use them; they were for testing. Unfortunately, I never generated revocation certs for these keys, and I no longer have the secret keys. Is there anyway to remove these keys from the servers? In the future, I'll make off-site backups and revoke certs ASAP... even when playing around. Thanks in Advance,
Brad Tilley

Thanks to everyone for the info. I have learned from your answers. GNUpg is a serious security tool that should be treated as such. People like me (new GNUpg users who want to experiment but don't fully understand the complexity of asymmectrical encryption), probably shouldn't send keys to key servers unless they know exactly what they are doing.  Thanks agian for the advice!

@_subject: What to do on a different computer ? 
When you transfer the .gnupg directory to another machine, be sure that the permission on the directory is the same as it was on the original machine. GPA kept seg faulting on me until I realized that I had no write permission on my copied .gnupg directory. Proper permission can do wonders!
How can I save the generated information about my keys,

@_subject: CNN on PGP and alternatives 
GPA works well for my needs, but it is nowhere near that level of refinement that Network Associates had reached with their GUI. I am a Linux user, so I may be a bit more computer literate than the average MS user.
I think gpg works well with email on Linux. I use it daily with KDE and Evolution, and the encryption it provides is almost transparent with either of these clients. I wish that there were more options for encrypting local files and directories through gpg, but I think one day there will be. I think he should have said "Windows" tools must be easier to use, because that is the _big_ user base when it comes to PC systems and email clients. But if you think about it, no method of encryption is as transparent as they need to be (on any OS) in order for widespread public acceptance.

@_subject: File Size 
Hello GNU Freedom loving people of the world!
This is not a problem, only a question:
Why is the output from GNUpg smaller than the input? For example, I have a files that is 36,232,576 bytes before encryption, but is only 34,463,967 bytes after encryption. It seems that encryption would make it a bit bigger, but it does just the opposite.
Is there some sort of compression that takes place during the process? I run GNU/Linux (Kernel-2.4.9) with gcc 2.9.5-3 with GNUpg 1.0.6 with GPA Keep up the great work!!!

@_subject: removing the secmem warning 
I agree. Users don't need to know that GNUpg is POSIX, or most other technical facts about the software. But since GNUpg is exclusively about privacy and security, a user _should_ be told of the insecure memory issue as it directly affects their privacy and security.

Sylpheed's support for encryption is in its early stages. A standard sylpheed install doesn't include encryption support at all; it has to be added manually during the compile process.
Sylpheed's website cautions users that the encryption feature is still in very earliy development.
I would suggest that your firend use a different email client. Kmail or mutt are 2 of the best. I use Kmail with GUNpg daily without any problems.

Hello GNU loving guys and gals!
I have been using gpg 1.06 for a long time now (> a year) and have been
very satisfied with it. I use it with gpa because I like the GUI.
Mostly, I encrypt files that are stored on my hard drive. However, I do
occasionally use gpg for email encryption with kmail and Evolution.
Here's my question:
Is it worthwhile to upgrade to 1.07? What would I gain, or perhaps loose
by upgrading? I run RedHat Linux.

@_subject: catching output from gpg --verify 
Hello Gnupg users,
I am writing a script to automate the downloading and building of Linux
kernels. As a part of the script, I use gpg to check and make sure that
the kernel key is installed:
    check = os.popen('gpg --list-keys')
    data = check.read()
    check.close()
This works well. I can read the data from gpg --list-keys and check it
and then proceed. If the key is not installed, I download and install
it, if it is installed, I move on.
However, the next case in which I need to use gpg fails because I cannot
capture the output of gpg --verify:
    cmd = os.popen('gpg --verify kernel_name_sig, kernel_name)        data = cmd.read()
    cmd.close()
I've tried re-directing the output to a file (doesn't work) form the
command line and from my script. Any tips on how to capture this output
would be greatly appreciated.
