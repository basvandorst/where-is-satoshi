Hello All,
I would like to know who has interest in GnuPG & Mozilla.  I am aware of
the licensing scheme (and of ways around it).  In particular I am looking
for people who are knowledgeable in RFC2440, Mozilla, or PGP in general,
people who are already working on or are interested in working on getting
PGP working in Mozilla seamlessly and sensibly.
