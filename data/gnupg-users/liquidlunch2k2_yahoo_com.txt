@_subject: Compilation errors... 
I'm trying to install gnupg-1.9.17 on my Debian spar64
workstation. After several issues (that I managed to
resolve ony my own), I am now faced with a
showstopper. Here is it is black'n'white:
mylinux:/opt/gnupg-1.9.17/agent# make
source='call-scd.c' object='call-scd.o' libtool=no \
DEPDIR=.deps depmode=gcc /bin/sh ../scripts/depcomp \
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I..  -I../gl -I../common
-I../intl -DLOCALEDIR=\"/usr/local/share/locale\"
-DGNUPG_DATADIR="\"/usr/local/share/gnupg\""        -I/usr/include -g -O2 -Wall -c call-scd.c
In file included from call-scd.c:34:
location of the previous definition
call-scd.c: In function `agent_scd_check_aliveness':
call-scd.c:409: warning: implicit declaration of
function `assuan_set_flag'
call-scd.c:409: `ASSUAN_NO_WAITPID' undeclared (first
use in this function)
call-scd.c:409: (Each undeclared identifier is
reported only once
call-scd.c:409: for each function it appears in.)
make: *** [call-scd.o] Error 1
`ASSUAN_NO_WAITPID' is undeclared. Am I comipiling
this thing wrong, or do I need to tweak the
"call-scd.c" file to make this work? (My C/C++ skills
are limited, but I'm not afraid of any learning
If someone has seen this before, and knows how to go
about correcting this problem, I would appreciate any
help you can offer.
