@_subject: RSA and GPG 
We are looking at not using E Business Sever and using gpg.  I have
export my private keys from pgp and imported them to gpg and all testing
was looking good but I have one old key that is a RSA key that I still
get data encrypted with this key.  I cannot get these to decrypt and get
the following errors.  Any thoughts??
[root pgp]# gpg --decrypt DP003396.pgp
gpg: protection algorithm 1 is not supported
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID 9E51A9E3, created 1998-10-20
      "rsa "
gpg: public key decryption failed: unknown cipher algorithm
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
