@_subject: extracting a public key from the secret key 
Hash: SHA1
Content-Description: signed data
If no one else has the public key, you might as well generate a new pair.
If you've encrypted a file or two with it, you can decrypt them with the
secret you still have and then reencrypt with the new key you generate.
The only thing I can think might give trouble is verifying old signatures.
