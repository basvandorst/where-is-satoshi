Hey Bob!
Sounds like you might be confusing digital certificates with PGP. They
are two very different beasts and while each may be used to sign and/or
encrypt they go about it differently.
Thunderbird has no native support for PGP. But popping in Enigmail makes
it very easy so you shouldn't have too hard a time googling for info.
Thunderbird uses the Certificate Manager to handle X.509 digital
certificates and can handle them with no other extensions required. If
you want to test drive these, check out Thawte (
or CAcert ( both of which issue free email client
certificates via a method very similar to PGP's web-of-trust.

IIRC the online help for PGP 8.x (licensed or freeware) has a pretty
good section on ADK. Note that you would have to explicitly specify this
type of key setup in order to get the key reconstruction capabilities -
it's important to note that it's not the default action. You're not
going to be able to take your data to a data recovery shop and pay them
big $$$ to "reconstruct" a key if you don't already have the
prerequisite # of key shares.

With GnuPG 1.4.x, there are some card-related commands that will allow
you to manipulate all aspects of the OpenPGP card:
GnuPG OpenPGP card commands:
~     --card-status             print the card status
~     --card-edit               change data on a card
~     --change-pin              change a card's PIN
