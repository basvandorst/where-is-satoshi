@_subject: Batch Program Needs to Bypass the Passphrase 
I am writing a batch program (.bat) to encrypt and decrypt files.  However,
I'm having trouble figuring out how to NOT have it prompt me for a
passphrase.  I've looked up things on --passphrase-fd 0 and environment
variables, but I can't seem to find the actual steps to follow to get it
working properly.
Please let me know if you can help!

@_subject: Problems Installing GnuPG 
============================== START ==============================
I have downloaded the gnupg-w32cli-1.2.3.zip file, and extracted the files.
I have created a c:\gnupg folder, and tried running "gpg" at the command
line, but I am getting an error that "gpg is not recognized as a command".
Did I miss a step?  I thought I followed the README file correctly, but
maybe not.  Please let me know if you can help!
