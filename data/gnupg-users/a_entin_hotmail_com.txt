@_subject: Problem With Decrypting Messages In Outlook 2003 w/ Gdata plugin  
* Forgive me if this is a repost.  I do not believe the original went through. *
I am having problems with decrypting a plain text messages in Outlook 2003:  When opening the message, the plugin prompts or my passphrase.  I type it and then message then appears unencrypted.  When I choose to decrypt the message, I get an error stating "The message is neither encrypted nor signed."  If I include attachments, they decrypt just fine!  Its seems to be limited to text messages.  Note that the message types were all in plain next (not HTML or RTF) and Word editing is turned OFF. I have tried on a few different PC's, OS's, etc.  Same problem!  Anyone aware of this issue or knows of a cure?  Thanks!
* OS - Windows XP
* GNUPG version - Tried both 1.2.5 & 1.4.0a
* Outlook Plugin - Gdata G10 v. 0.94
* Outlook version:  Tried both Outlook 2000 & 2003.
* Shell - GPG Shell v. 3.32

@_subject: New Outlook Plugin .99.1 (Beta) - works great! 
Hats off and a big "thanks" to the G10 group for the new Outlook Plugin v. .99.1 (Beta).  I tested it and it resolved all of the prior problems I was having with the plugin and Outlook 2003.  Primarily, the new version resolved the error that occurred each time I tried to decrypt a message that stated, "The message is neither encrypted nor signed."
Thanks again!

You can also try this site which has compiled the Outlook plugin with an installer and WinPT: Try the following to install:
1) Go to Tolls -> Options->Other and click on "Advanced Options" and then "Add-in Manager."
2) Uncheck the "GPG Exchange" box
3) Click on OK until you return to your Outlook screen
4) Close down outlook
5) Go to the Task Manager and make sure that Outlook.exe is not running.  If it is, terminate it.
6) Uninstall the Outlook Plugin.  I suggest that you unregister the plugin by opening up a command prompt and typing:  "regsvr32 /u gpgexch.dl"
7) Now, install the Outlook plugin again
8) If its not loading, see step 1 and make sure that the "GPG Exchange" box is checked.  Open and close Outlook.
It should work.

@_subject: --skip-verify 
I have turned off verification of signatures via the --skip-verify option and it works well.  Problem is that it produces a message stating "gpg: signature verification suppressed."  Is there any way to disable this message?  It is causing some problems with writing error logs and our automated processes.  Any suggestions would be very appreciated!
