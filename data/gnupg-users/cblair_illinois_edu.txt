@_subject: claws mail will not verify signatures 
I installed gpg4win, including claws mail.  I used gpa to import
a public key, and have been able to send encrypted mail using this
key.  However, when I try to verify the signature on the test
message below, I get a message saying "timeout".
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
   ... and delivered.
   What is the matter
with stupid clawsmail?

@_subject: symmetric encryption is not working 
I have been using gpg (GnuPG) 2.1.18 on a debian linux
for several years.  In the last few days, I have noticed
that symmetric encryption is not working.
The command
gpg -c --cipher-algo AES testfile
creates testfile.gpg after asking for a passphrase.
However, the command
gpg testfile.gpg yields the message
and creates a plaintext file without asking for
a passphrase.
