@_subject: Keysigning request 
Is there anyone in the Chicago area who would be willing and able to meet me
to sign my GPG key?  Yes, I have looked on Biglumber and contacted several
people from there.  Yes, I have searched for WoT groups in the area.
If you, or someone you know, is in the Chicago area and would be able to
meet with me to id me and sign my key, I would very much appreciate it.
Thank you for your time.

@_subject: Question on subkeys usage and OpenPGP card.  - warning, quite lengthy 
Why can keys not be signed with a signing subkey rather than a primary
signing key?  I just learned of this after going to my first signing party.
Perhaps I have misunderstood the purpose of subkeys.
I have read that it is good practice to create a primary signing key, and
then use subkeys on the card.  This is the recommended method for setup of
the FSFE card, which is just a fancy skin on the OpenPGP card.  My problem
is that now I have a DSA primary key on trusted media in a safe location,
which I have to retrieve for any key signing I want to perform.  I cannot
simply sign the keys with the signing subkey stored on my OpenPGP card.
Are there any security implications for using the same signing key for
normal document signing *and* key signing?
Would it be any less secure to:
1) generate the primary signing key as a 1024 bit RSA key,
2) create the encryption and authentication keys as 1024 bit RSA subkeys of
the signing key, and
3) copy all of these keys to the OpenPGP card?
I would also create all the keys using a machine with no network interfaces,
booted from a trusted livecd.  This procedure should allow me to make a
backup copy of my private keys to removable media (usb drive or burn a CD),
just in case the card is somehow damaged.  It would also afford me the
security and usefulness of the card for everyday use (as well as allow me to
sign keys using the card).  However, then I have to go meet everyone again
to sign my new primary signing key.
This brings me to my last question.  Let us assume that I create a primary
signing key with an expiration.  I then get that key signed by several
people.  When the expiration date is near, do I simply create a new signing
key and sign it with the original key (before it expires, of course)?  Is
the new key then considered just as trusted as the original key, which has
all the signatures on it?  Is there any method for transferring the
signatures to the new key, or would the new key have to be resigned by
everyone that signed the original?  Using the default WoT model, doesn't
this mean that every third time the key is renewed, it would not be trusted
and would need to be resigned by everyone that signed the previous key?
Yes, I have RTFM, and several mailing list postings, but I'm still a bit
unclear on these questions.
If you are still reading this - thank you for your time!  I look forward to
your reply.

Sounds like I should just regenerate a new 1024 bit RSA primary signing key
and copy it to the card (and an encryption subkey as well, of course).
Thank you for your help!

Already had the revocations generated, but won't send them to the keyserver
until I gen new replacement keys.  Thanks for the reminder, but I have it
covered.  Suppose I should have mentioned that, but I kinda thought it went
without saying.

@_subject: How to establish a company web-of-trust 
Some points to consider:
Regardless of whether or not the company signing key has signed or
revoked it's signature on the user's signing key, it is ultimately up to
the employee to trust or not trust the other employee's key(s).  This is
one of the beautiful points of PGP/GPG - there is no third party to
dictate who's keys you can trust or not trust.  That trust decision is
solely up to the user.
Please, no one flame me, but it is worth looking at S/MIME and PGP for
this issue. Yes, on a purely technical level, we are talking about the
same cryptographic algorithms.  The difference between S/MIME and PGP,
as I understand it, is mainly semantics involving the trust
relationships.  In S/MIME, a third party dictates to you what is to be
trusted or untrusted.  In contrast, under PGP the user defines what is
to be trusted or not.
I'm very interested in this thread, as I'm not clear as to how you could
create policies (at least ones that can be enforced) to control trust
relationships in a company.  This seems to be more a question of office
politics than secure email technology.  In a small company, this could
certainly be handled.  Mention the issue at the regular staff meetings,
and it remains the user's responsibility to revoke trust in that
keypair.  By the same token - good luck to you in implementing this if
you are referring to a larger company.  If you create scripts or
otherwise to force employees to check their keyring against some central
corporate keyserver, please share.  I hope your users are savvy enough
to understand what they are doing.  If that is the case, so much the
better for you, lucky dog!

NO - education on using GPG will be the hardest part.  If your partners
understand using GPG, you're more than half way there.  Given that
knowledge changes things a bit.  Why not generate all the keys *for*
your employees - AND immediately generate revocation certificates.  If
someone leaves, simply send the revocation certificate to those that
conversed with that employee (and submit it to your keyserver).
If I wasn't a proponent of GPG, would I be on this list? ;)
I'm impressed with the maturity of this mailing list.  Most lists would
have exploded into a religious war.  Really says something of the
caliber of the people on this list.
There are some options here.  You could use the expert mode in GPG when
generating their signing keys to remove the ability to certify with the
signing keys to restrict users a bit more.  Then they could sign
documents, but not keys (if I understand that correctly).  Or perhaps
signing and encryption subkeys would be appropriate?  That would
simplify things - one primary signing key to protect.
Only some of them need GPG? Ought to make your life a little easier. ;)
Depending on what you are using with/for the MUA to implement the
signing and encryption, you could use rules to simplify this for the users.

@_subject: Decyrption via scheduled task fails 
I would think we should keep this in the list, such that other people
with a similar issue can search the list archives and find this answer.
 And so others know whether or not it *is* resolved in the end.  Hope
you don't mind me posting it back to the list.
If you try your commands directly from the command line, what happens?
Does it complain about syntax? Does it work and produce a log file?
Try this:
1. Check the working directory of the scheduled task. Make sure it is
set to the folder where the encrypted files are located.  Perhaps it is
working and just writing everything out to the working directory?
2. Change the job to use full paths for the executables, and redirect
the output to a file:
echo SECRETPASSPHRASE | C:\path-to-WinPT\gpg --passphrase-fd 0
--decrypt-files C:\path-to-files\*.pgp --logger-file gpg_logfile.txt >
Personally, I would leave the --logger-file directive in there even
after everything is working properly.  That way if there is ever a
question in the future, you'll at least have the log to verify what
occurred.  Once it is working, add a line to be beginning of the script
to remove the previous day's log file.

Whoops, I missed something - order of arguments may matter, as it apparently is
taking the "--logger-file logfile" as more files to decrypt.
echo SECRETKEY | gpg --logger-file gpg_logfile.txt --passphrase-fd 0
--decrypt-files c:\mcdown\*.pgp > gpg_output.txt
