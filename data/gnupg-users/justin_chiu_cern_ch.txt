@_subject: Do not cache smart card PIN 
Is it possible to instruct a smart card to not cache its PIN or have
GnuPG forcibly clear the PIN cache?
My understanding is that the PIN is cached internally [1] unless if you
enable "forcesig" (which only applies to signing operations). If this
caching by the smart card cannot be turned off for encryption and
authentication as well, then perhaps it is possible to configure GnuPG
to clear the smart card's PIN cache after every operation?
