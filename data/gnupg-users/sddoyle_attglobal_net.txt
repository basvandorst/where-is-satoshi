Hash: SHA1
I have installed GPG 1.4.0, and wanted to try out GPA, too.  When I
./configure'd the GPA files, I got a compile error saying my install
couldn't find GPGME, and it stopped.  Specifically, the last 3 lines
of the GPA config.log said:
configure:8918: checking for GPGME - version >= 0.4.3
configure:8961: result: no
configure:8963: error: Cannot find an up to date GPGME
So I went back to the website, downloaded GPGME 1.0.2, and when I
./configure'd it, it died with the lines:
configure:21760: checking for GPG Error - version >= 0.5
configure:21792: result: no
configure:21794: error: libgpg-error was not found
Is there a way around this?  It appears that my system has a file called
gpg-error in /usr/bin, and that's in the path.
