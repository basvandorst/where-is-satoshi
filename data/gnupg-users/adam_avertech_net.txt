I'm trying to get pinentry-curses (0.7.2_6) to work with gpg and
gpg-agent (v2.0.4).  Both installed via /usr/ports on
FreeBSD-RELEASE, default Makefile options.  But it is not
When I enter my passphrase in the pinentry-curses dialog, the
response is:
Any help would be greatly appreciated.  :)  I haven't had much
luck googling around.  I do not want to use a graphical-based
pinentry because I'm running xterm only over ssh session and I'm
not interested in X forwarding.

Nice tip!  Thanks.
Ok, I execute pinentry and get this:
       +-----------------------------------------------+
 PIN: *************************_______________ |
                                               |
                   |
       +-----------------------------------------------+
After typing in passphrase in the dialog, I get a successful echo
of my passphrase:
  pinentry-curses: no LC_CTYPE known - assuming UTF-8
  D <...removed...>
  OK
Pinentry appears to be fine.
This is the dialog I get:
       +------------------+
     |
       +------------------+
So it also appears gpg-agent is fine.
Alright, will do.  I'll send relevant results of kdump of
ktrace.out soon.  Thanks Werner!

Didn't get very exciting output of ktrace:
A ktrace of the same cmdline, but with pinentry->pinentry-gtk,
renders the exact same output (except pid of course) -- and
pinentry-gtk works where pinentry->pinentry-curses does not.
Any suggestions for deeper inspection?

I was wondering if anyone had any further ideas?  :)
