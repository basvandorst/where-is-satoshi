As Stefan wrote, try haveged.
Or: if your CPU has "RDRAND" (i.e. grep rdrand /proc/cpuinfo) it contains
Intel's hardware RNG. Which you have to trust, as it's a proprietary
feature of a big player. But Linux's entropy gathering mixes its output
with other sources of randomness,
Then there are  and
 as
hardware random number generators. Both are worth their money IMO.
