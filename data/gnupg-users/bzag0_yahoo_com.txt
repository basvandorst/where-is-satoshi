Great example, Alex !...  BZAG
a newbie to encryption and
that you couldn't
You can't.  But you can use the hash as a key to
For example, if they were using full names to generate
the hash:
Watch list contains:
"Alex Mauer" -> foo
"Billy Z Williamson" -> bar
"Corgi McCorkerton" -> baz
Passenger list contains:
"Billy Z. Williamson" -> xyzzy
"Alex Mauer" -> foo
"Fenster LeCrab" -> baz
...they only need to compare the hashes, for the
cruise ship company to
see that "Alex Mauer" should not be allowed to board,
and the government
to see that "Alex Mauer" attempted to board a cruise
The government doesn't need to reveal their watch list
to the cruise
ship company, and vice versa.
This also illustrates some problems with the system,
namely hash
collisions (two people generate the hash "baz") and
the fact that slight
changes in data will lead to totally different hashes
(added period
after middle initial).

What?  You expect the age of enlightenment?  You
forget who's President.  Usually when the head stinks
the fish is not far behind.

So?  Minnesota isn't undergoing the same nonsense as
the rest of the country?  You underestimate your red
state colleagues' influence in ANY state.
