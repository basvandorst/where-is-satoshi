Hi *.*!
I am developing a Java application which signs documents. I want to have
detached signatures so I am using the b (--detach-sign) option.
Can anybody help me with the corrected use of the --passphrase-fd
option. I tried for some time, but it didnt work.
A example would be useful.

Hi Armin!
I only have e-mail access, so if someone could
mail me the answer or an example it would make things
easier for me.
By the way: I am developing in a Windows NT environment.
