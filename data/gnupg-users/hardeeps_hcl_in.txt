Hi All
Isnt it pretty easy to have a script on the server (try to) decrypt each
email. If the email decrypts, fine else not allow the email to go
through. That will force people to retain the option in conf file if
they want their message to reach. Hardeep Singh

Yes.  Put "encrypt-to (the-adk-key)" in everyone's gpg.conf.
Of course, they could turn around and take it right out again.  Unless
you have pretty tight control over the environment, ADKs or encrypt-tos
are not foolproof (and that applies to both PGP and GPG).
As I said before, note that this isn't safe because of the crypto math.
It's "safe" because you can fire people who don't do it.
