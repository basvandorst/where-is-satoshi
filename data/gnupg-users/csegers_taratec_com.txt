@_subject: gpg on cygwin error 
I have installed the cygwin gpg package, and have tried to import the KEYS
from Apache as follows:
$ gpg --import KEYS
gpg: fatal: //.gnupg: cant't create dircetory: No such file or directory
secmem usage: 0/0 bytes in 0/0 blocks of pool 0/16384
This from the dir with Apache download files, including KEYS file. Also
$ gpg --import /usr/downloads/KEYS
with the same results. Is this a cygwin problem maybe? Should I try to
conpile gpg instead of using the cygwin package?
Thanks for your help,
