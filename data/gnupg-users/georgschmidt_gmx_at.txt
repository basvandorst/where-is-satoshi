@_subject: Pinpad on Cyberjack 
Hello All,
I tried to get my OpenGpg Card working under Ubuntu, but with only mixed success. Is my understanding correct that pinpads on card readers are only supported by gpg2? gpg1 does not support keypads?
For GPG2 I installed the following packages:
 - Driver  V3.3.5 (IFD) for the Cyberjack (from the ReinerSCT Web-site)
 - gnupg2
 - pcsc-lite
 - gpgsm
The card is recognised and seems to work, but the PIN still has to be entered via the the keyboard. The pinpad on the reader itself is not recognised.
It has been reported in the past, that the pinpad on the Cyberjack didn't work with gpg2 and I was wondering whether that still was the case or whether with the new drivers it should be OK now. Or is there an option, which tells the program that the PIN is expected from the pinpad and not the keyboard?
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks a lot,
