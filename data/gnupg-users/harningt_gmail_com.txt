@_subject: Establishing new key - key setup recommendations 
I've generated and published a 8192-bit non-expiring RSA 'master' key
for signing other keys as well as 2048-bit RSA keys for signing and
encryption (expiring in a few years).  The master key is protected by
I have not had it signed by other users yet and am concerned that I
might want to generate a new keyset before I get the 8192-bit key in
wide circulation.  I have, however, signed tags in my Git source
repository with a subkey... so would it make sense to migrate those
subkeys (through trickery i've seen)... or would the fact that they
are available under the 8192-bit key be a general problem?
Some options I am considering after reading blogs/etc:
 * Generate RSA 4096-bit master signing key and revoke the 8192-bit
key noting that it has been superceded
 * Generate DSA 3072-bit master signing key and revoke... (this is
well supported, right?)
 * Wait for ECC to be in standard and supported by PGP and GnuPG
 * Generate ECC key and keep it alongside my better-supported 8192-bit
key until better software support arrives (perhaps keeping both
  - this implies the ECC public key storage for signing it has been
set in stone...
Any help in this decision would be well appreciated.

@_subject: No, it is not. 
GnuPG has a mode to handle this sort of encryption without identification...
While the default is to provide a reference for the key that is usable
to decrypt the message, you can opt to not include this information at
the cost of making the other party take a little more time to decrypt
(it has to scan all of its available keys).
If you want authentication in there as well, you'd just need to wrap
the signature inside the encrypted-body rather than around it.
An example use of this would be to send a message to a bulk mailing
list or post it on the web at a known "drop" point (preventing the
intermediate servers from knowing both parties directly) wrapped as
follows: GPG(encrypt-to-X but dont mention X, GPG(sign-with-Y(msg))

I've had great experiences with the "PC Twin Reader" from Gemalto.  If
using purely OSX and have no access to Windows (for a firmware
update), I'd recommend against the SCR331 series in case you happen
upon one that does not have the firmware updated to be fully CCID
compliant.  Note that the SCR331 is sometimes rebranded and has 3rd
party firmware which may or may not be fully CCID compliant.  One of
the easy ways to tell if you have it is the shape of reader (the
'supported' list pictures it)

@_subject: GPG with SMP? 
Certain modes of AES can be safely parallelizable in both directions:
 CTR can be since it uses a counter value to make each encryption different
for the XOR operation used.
 ESSIV or XTS are also useful in parallelization, but might need tweaking
for single-file encryption.

@_subject: Oracle behavior in Gnupg? // (was 'possible bug in gpg?') 
... CUT ...
Should we be worried about "oracle" behavior on a local running
application? It seems "oracle" behavior is all the rage even though it
makes ZERO sense on a local machine unless there is obfuscation
involved. On a local machine, you could take the data and just run the
algorithms yourself.
Does anyone run gpg on a server and let people send arbitrary data to
it? If so, then I'd suggest that a "quiet" execution be performed that
way only the exit code can be used that it's failure.

@_subject: Paperkey 1.3 
You may want to check out my blog post about key backup[1]. In it I
mention two bar-code style backup solutions:
 * PaperBack [2]
 * Twibright Optar [3]
I also investigated QR codes and other 2D bar codes.. however they did
not seem to scale well to large amounts of data...
I found that PaperBack, while being a Win32 app (runs fine in Wine)
works beautifully for storing quite a bit of data with redundancy and
handling for user-level printers. Quoting the page "If you have a good
laser printer with the 600 dpi resolution, you can save up to 500,000
bytes of uncompressed data on the single A4/Letter sheet." ... quite a
bit to store your entire secret keyring ... though you could use
paperkey + this to permit bumping up redundancy / dot-size quite a
Twibright Optar has quite a bit of promise, but requires quite a bit
of pre-processing and noise removal (not to mention source-code edit
to change dot-size to work nicely with non-super printers).

@_subject: GPG weakness 
I believe the issue here is that if you are running inside a virtual
machine, information can leak between VMs and the VM host about certain CPU
flags/etc. This can lead to the ability to steal data.
In general GnuPG is pretty secure and does a good job at keeping data
protected even if an adversary is on the local machine... however when you
are sharing cycles or have malware running on your machine, the security
game is no longer yours and you are gambling. A step in the right direction
would be to use a hardware token, but if you have malware running, it could
interject itself into the signature flow and have the device sign its own
data instead of data you provide...

@_subject: Smart card reader security 
Wow, that's a lot of firmware space for something that looks so
simple. Hopefully they open-source the firmware (though I suppose they
should shove unsightly decryption key absconding code in the firmware
that runs the firmware).
One could also be concerned about regular readers... there's alot of
space they "could" be putting storage space for decryption keys so
that if the device is "lost" or "shipped for manufacturer servicing"
they can pull them off.
In short, it's really hard to be sure that anything is safe. You have
to start somewhere.

@_subject: Upgrading keys to larger than 1024 
If you are upgrading, I would recommend contacting those that you
previously had keysigning with and see if the policy they follow
allows for obtaining re-signatures based on prior information.
My key signing policy [1] allows for an "Accelerated Signing" where I
may opt to sign a users' key given certain conditions, such as they
must show control of the prior key and it must not have been revoked
due to compromise, etc...
This was put in due to the understanding that keys should be recycled
on occasion to keep with the times and it isn't always practical to
meet up with everybody you exchanged signatures with.
A better solution, hopefully useful for you, is to contact everybody
you've exchanged signatures and have a grand ol' signing party, but
oftentimes it isn't practical.

I believe this blog article could be a useful reference:

The article does omit any backup measures, so I added a separate long

While PGP Global Directory provides for some basic level of "this email address belongs to this key"... its key signing policy leads to "cruft" buildup.

@_subject: backing up keys 
I wrote up a blog post a while back illustrating some backup mechanisms:
The PaperBack ( tool creates backups for data
that can span multiple sheets of paper and have a varying level of
redundancy and resolution.
Checking out a backup made quite a while ago, since the dots were quite
large, there wasn't much degradation in decoding ...barely activating
redundancy measures. It should do well even if you fold the paper as even
if you fold it in quarters, many of the squares should remain unmarred....
I archived my paper backup inside a sealed document mailer - a nice help
against folding and useful marker if it were opened without my knowledge.
