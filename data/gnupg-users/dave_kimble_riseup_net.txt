@_subject: upgrading v1 to v2 
Ubuntu 14.04 with gnupg 1.4.16 installed from Ubuntu repository.
Enigmail says it is about time I upgraded to gnupg v2.
Ubuntu Software Centre says I have the latest version.
I have git cloned gnupg ?v2.0.26? and attempted to configure.
It says I need libgpg-error, libgcrypt, libassuan, libksba, npth
I have installed libgpg-error-1.9 , apparently OK.
I can see /usr/lib/bin/libgpg-error and /libgpg-error-config
When I try to configure libgcrypt-1.6.3 it says:
checking for gpg-error-config... /usr/local/bin/gpg-error-config
checking for GPG Error - version >= 1.11... no
configure: error: libgpg-error is needed.
Obviously I am doing something wrong, so its my fault, but this is
ABSOLUTELY HOPELESS if you want people to adopt gnupg.  I work with
clients who don't know what an email client is, let alone what theirs is
called, on a wide variety of OSs.  They cannot possibly do this all
this.  Is it too much to ask that you produce an Ubuntu-friendly
repository that takes care of all the dependencies and compiling?
Rant over, please help.

It seems I've been replying to individuals rather than the list, sorry.
Thanks to all who helped sort me out.
I have been back over the website, trying to find the point where I got on the wrong track.
I think it is down to  which has the GnuPG Binary Releases section AFTER the Source Code Releases.
Since I know how to build from sources (notwithstanding my stuff ups), I just clicked on stable source download and never got to see the bit at the bottom.
Perhaps those sections could be reversed, to save you from idiots wasting your time.
The link for Debian isn't very helpful. Linking to Debian GnuPG Maintainers would be better:
 at lists.alioth.debian.org
that's where you get to see "gnupg" and "gnupg2", without which you are going to be baffled.
