@_subject: Signing people with only one form of ID? 
I never made it to a formal key signing, all I did was look up biglumber:
and found someone who would be in my area. We met, I showed him my ID, we talked a bit, and he signed my key.
He lives in Switzerland and I live in Athens,Ga, USA. If I wantyed to drive 80 miles to Atlanta, I could probably find a number of people to sign my key, but this way I got to meet someone from another country!

@_subject: adding a new email to a key 
I am new on the list, so point me to the right documentation. I am using Debian Lenny, and I have Kgpg installed.
right now I have a keypair for my main email address of paul (at) I wanted to add another email address to that key, ale (at) pcartwright.com
I'm not real sure of the sequence or path to take to accomplish this. I tried adding another uid, I tried adding a subkey. but both times I ended up with Kgpg showing the new email as the primary, instead of as uid

I guess it is more a perception problem than an issue then. My concern was that my original key, the primary email address was changed. Both email addresses were still in the key, so I guess it isn't a problem so much as an aesthetic issue. Now I'll go back and add the UID for the second email,
thanks for clarifying!

@_subject: adding a new email to a key 
I understand that. It wasn't a revoke-type issue, I was just trying to figure out exactly how things worked.. I didn't know about the 2nd email becoming primary.. ( say newbie).
I'm still learning the difference between addition emails ( UID) and subkeys.
My situation is, I have an ISP, and I don't use their email, except for one list that kept bouncing my domain email.
I have my domain, my main email, and a bunch of addresses I use for different I also have a yahoo email account that is almost as old as Yahoo.
I have a work email account, for when I travel on business.
so what is the appropriate way to add all those, or should I even do that?

well, I found that you can change the path for gpg 1.4.9 using the ./configure --prefix=PATH. so I recompiled it with /usr/bin instead of the default /usr/local/bin. SO, gnupg installs by default to /usr/local/bin, per the INSTALL file:
Installation Names
By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PREFIX'.
yet, kmail was looking specifically for /usr/bin/gpg.
