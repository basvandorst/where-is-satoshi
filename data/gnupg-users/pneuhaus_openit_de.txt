I'd like to put some things clear...
1 - the maintainer of the list is on holiday til 2000-05-02
2 - the list software is _NOT_ majordomo but `slist'
3 - there is no Pierre-Henri.Senesi subscribed to the list,

I hope this is the last mail in this case... looking at the mailheader it's pretty obvious, that
Pierre-Henri.Senesi doesn't get his mail directly from the
list but rather from frederik
I'm sorry but I had to put you off the list, frederik
Please fix the problem first and subscribe again.
see mailheader below for more Information.
I hope Werner won't kill me for interefering with his administrator's
you can only unsubscribe yourself.
So that user who don't want to subscribe can seek help, too.

set the 'Set-User-ID Bit' to prevent GnuPG from using insecure
or insert the Option 'no-secmem-warning' in ~/.gnupg/options to
tell GnuPG to ignore the warnings.

@_subject: How to change the install dir? 
when you're in the GnuPG source directory:
   ./configure --prefix=/path/to/your/directory
for example
   ./configure --prefix=$HOME
will configure GnuPG to be installed in the directories $HOME/bin,
$HOME/lib, $HOME/man and $HOME/share. For more options
   ./configure --help
is also a good idea. Be sure to read the files README and INSTALL in the
GnuPG source directory...
           Regards,
                Peter
