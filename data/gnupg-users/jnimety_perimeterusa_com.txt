@_subject: using a  key server with gpgme 
Is it possible to retrieve/publish keys to/from a key server using gpgme?  I've discovered gpgme_set_keylist_mode and GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_EXTERN but how do I specify the keyserver and have gpgme publish a public key to the key server after generating a new key
