@_subject: Decryption fails with 4096bit key on SmartCard 
Hi Marcus,
I got a heads-up just today, thanks for sharing your problem!
I assumed you're using Nitrokey Pro.
I couldn't reproduce your case both using package versions you mentioned
and slightly earlier ones available in Debian-testing I use for
development. Each time I generated a 4096-bit RSA encryption subkey,
successfully copied it to a OpenPGP 2.1 card and decrypted using it.
Could you send a detailed list of steps that need to be taken to
reproduce this bug? Otherwise I can't really address it.
