I've tried speedo build on GnuPG 2.2.6, but I've got an error like this:
$ make -f build-aux/speedo.mk native
make -f /gnupg-2.2.6/build-aux/speedo.mk UPD_SWDB=1 TARGETOS=native
WHAT=release WITH_GUI=0 all
make[1]: Entering directory '/gnupg-2.2.6'

gpgv: Good signature from "---"
GnuPG 2.1 version missing in swdb.lst!
version database.  Stop.
make[1]: Leaving directory '/gnupg-2.2.6'
build-aux/speedo.mk:73: recipe for target 'native' failed
make: *** [native] Error 2
The build script verifies GnuPG version based on gnupg21_ver in swdb.lst:
But gnupg21_ver seems to be deleted by this commit:

Hi Andre,
Great, the commit works well. And as far as I see the source code, SELFCHECK=0
seems better for my case this time. I would use it as a workaround.
I look forward to new version release fixing this issue.
