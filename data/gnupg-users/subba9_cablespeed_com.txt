@_subject: gpg key editing 
I am trying to edit my gpg keys and export them back to the keyservers.  These
keys have not been used in a while.  However I would like to maintain the same
keys.  So far, I have used the "--edit-keys" option and have changed the
expiration date to a new date in the future.  The key listing has "pub" and
"sub" IDs.  The expiration changes are reflected only on the "pub" key and not
on the "sub" key.
pub  1024D/5A3F71F3  created: 2001-08-20 expires: 2006-06-11 trust: -/-
sub  1024g/3D2AE96C  created: 2001-08-20 expires: 2002-08-20
(1)* Subba Rao (Linuxite) How do I change (or do I need to change) the expiration date on the "sub" key?
Thank you in advance for any help.

@_subject: OT: credit 
I was comparing all the IT services companies.  I do think Linux makes the
playing field equal in the services arena.
I was not comparing Unix flavors or Unix companies.

@_subject: Email Clients and digital signatures 
Hello everyone,
I have Windows98 on one of my desktops. There are a bunch of Email clients
out there now.  Outlook stands out the best, since you can have calender and
tasks list etc.  I would like to use OpenPGP to sign the outbound email.  Can
this be implemented for Outlook easily without having to read tons of HOWTO
If Outlook cannot sign email using OpenPGP, are there any other Email clients
(with calendar/task list etc., preferably) that will work with OpenPGP?
Thank you in advance for any information.
