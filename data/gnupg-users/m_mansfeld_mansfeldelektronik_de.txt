@_subject: Keyservers: multiple subkeys and revocation 
Short question:
If I have to revocate a key with multiple subkeys (one of the style which is corrupted on the "normal" keyservers): I submitted this key over one of the buggy keyservers, these keyservers show it corrupted, but nevertheless the public key block imports correctly and the few servers without the bug show it correctly (means the key is correctly propagated, only _shown_ corrupted on the standard keyservers)
Can I assume I can take any keyserver for submitting the _revocated_ key or should/shall I submit explicitely on a _not_ buggy keyserver (the only one I found seems to be keyserver.kjsl.com)
Thanks, regards
Matthias Mansfeld

Not the whole directory is necessary, just export your private keys (publik keys not necessary, they are included) and/or if you like, your whole keyring, store it on a floppy disk or USB-stick or CD-ROM or anywhere else or just print it out on a sheet of paper (you would be able to retype it in or OCR it again in an *.asc-File). And don't forget to store a revocation certificate together with your backup copy together with your keys or better additionally at another Even if somebody else gets your private keys, they aren't worth anything for him as long as he hasn't your passphrases.

What type is the file? If it is just an already perfectly compressed *.zip, *.jpg, *.pdf or similar, then I would guess GPG can not squeeze it further. The encryption itself adds data, thus the result may be bigger than the original.

If your mail client is able to select the way it signs depending on  the recipient's address (for example GPGRelay, in fact a nice local  proxy for mail clients which are completetly unable to do anything  wich GnuPG) then you can let it sign for all "default" recipients with  PGP/MIME and only for these who cannot handle this, with inline

Hash: SHA256
I like this idea very much. (I must admit, I did not take notice of
this feature at keyserver.pgp.com, However, I just tried it, but it
refused my whole pubkey because it contains an expired subkey, but
that's not a problem of the concept...).
Uploadingonly with validation by e-mail to all (or at least a
selected one) user-ids like keyserver.pgp.com does would be a really
huge improvement and would address the initial problem about fake
keys which lead the guy at c't to his PGP bashing.
Key distribution between the keyservers same as now, and deleting a
key on all servers (manually or after "Timeout" without confirmation)
should be possible from any of these servers, not just this one the
key was initially uploaded.
And the objective should be to replace or retrofit the current system
of keyservers. Two concurrent systems would not make OpenPGP more
user friendly.
What about crowdfunding such a development?

Hello, maybe someone has similar effects or can give me a hint where to look. If not, it's OK...
Windows 7 pro(64), GPGRelay 9.962 (a POP3/SMTP "proxy" or better local relay for GnuPG), GnuPG 1.4.18, Pegasus Mail 4.72de
Based on something strange on my computer (blocked memory etc. up to explorer.exe freeze after some hours running) finally my GnuPG freezes >> GPGRelay freezes waiting for GnuPG >> my Mail client freezes waiting for GPGRelay, and the common is nearly always, it freezes mostly exactly during loading a signed mail from Stephan Just killing all tasks doesn't help, it needs shutdown/reeboot from the whole Windows7. Then all these mails including Stephan's mail load fine, Signature veryfies fine etc...
Any ideas? Is something "special" with Stephan's signature or why happen these crashes mostly exactly with Stephan's mails?

No, I don't use any PMail Plugin at all (you mentioned a PGP Plugin which would work well with PGP, not GnuPG. A many years old GnuPG Plugin exists, but is totally unmaintained, doesn't work well with attachments etc....)
I use GPGRelay with GnuPG 1.4.18; Pegasus talks (unencrypted, unsigned) with GPGRelay on localhost with port numbers, and GPGRelay acts as "local proxy" which talks with the POP3 and SMTP servers and signs/verifies/encrypts/decrypts the mails with GnuPG.
See I would say (concerning GPGRelay/GnuPG) yes, because (standard answer) I did not change anything, not with Pegasus Mail, not with any settings in GPGRelay and it ran perfectly.
... OK, I will try this...
logs the _complete_ TCP/IP protocol (in this case between Pegasus Mail and GPGRelay) including the decrypted mail data... maybe it helps to see what happens last before everything stucks...
Similar logging exists for GPGRelay, and that is, where I see the last mail GPGRelay tries to retrieve from the POP3 server before it just hangs and where I found that it happens quite often during verifying especially your mails. That is, why I asked whether something on your signatures may be a bit "special"
Currently I have not the time to go much more in depth and can live with the fact that in that moment much other stuff on this computer tends to hang and the "easiest" way for now is to reboot... It is possible that this behaviour came with one of the last MS Thanks, best regards

I will activate logging in PMail (in GPGRelay it is already running) and post it (as zipped attachment would be fine?... I just need to purge the passwords in the logfiles...).
How can I start the most verbose logging from GnuPG itself (gpg.conf Please let me a few days time for this stuff, because the GnuPG problem itself has currently no show-stopper priority (other stuff must be done.... some printed wired board layouts ready before Xmas, my main business...)
OK, these keys are rather old... I think I prefer expire (.. a bit afraid of making some mistakes with revokation stuff and then messing up the whole keys....) The remainig subkey (2048 bit RSA) should be fine for encryption?

Hello list,
I just want to tell as it is now: It seems to happen something strange with network access within this PC. If it happens again, the mail client Pegasus cannot connect at all to localhost (neither to 127.0.0.1) where GPGRelay (the GnuPG "Proxy") would listen - If GPGRelay just would not reply, then I would get the timeout error from Pegasus, but nothing, Pegasus just freezes totally, nothing interesting in the Pegasus TCP/IP log.
But it seems not to be only pegasus-related, as if this has happened, I cannot even ping anything in my lan, not by name, not by IP, and also nowhere in the web. I guess I have to learn more about how TCP/IP etc. is supposed to work and how to debug it if it doesn't work anymore.
