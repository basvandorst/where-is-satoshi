I'd suggest she does not use PGP 6.5.8 from NAI, since there are some
security issues with it, and it doesn't handle GnuPG keys well (constant
error messages).  I know its anathema on this list, but the version of
PGP 6.5.8 that does cover these issues is PGP 6.5.8ckt Build 6 from

There is a Lotus plugin for PGP 6.5.8 and you may be able to get it from

has a plugin for Lotus.
Another avenue for you is to get GnuPGShell or WinPT which will allow
you to use the Windows version of GnuPG with any mailer.  GnuPGShell is
perhaps the most mature of those, but WinPT is open source. From

Hi there, Julia A. Case,
On 02 July 2001, I received the following message from you regarding
"Using gpg with Outlook/Outlook Express"
Because GnuPG is a commandline program, and there is no plug-in
available for any mailer in Windows, you will have to use one of the
GnuPG front ends, GnuPGShell or WinPT.
GnuPGShell is more mature and looks very like PGPtray, but it lacks
the "Current Window" option of PGP; it is free for use but not
OpenSource.  WinPT is very much in development, but it is OpenSource
and contains various facilities not found in GnuPGShell.
The PGP-Basics group has a number of documents on setting up GnuPG
with Windows at  Whilst I can understand your wish to make OE and Outlook  GnuPG
compatible, they are the most insecure programs available and the
cause of most virus propogation in Windows; even having them on your

secure mainstream e-mail programs which come with a GnuPG plugin,

Hi there, Florian Weimer,
On 08 July 2001, I received the following message from you regarding
"effects and incompatibilities between GPG1.0.6 and PGP CKT 06"
The Cyber Knights Templar (CKT) builds have been produced with NAI's
knowledge and I assume their permission from PGP 5.x and they even
have a version of PGP 2.6.x.
They take the NAI published source code and recompile it with
enhancements.  In fact, this is what happened with virtually all
international versions of PGP, so I would now guess that PGP is a
generic term.  Surely the trademark applies to the various flavours of
NAI PGP?
As far as PGP 6.5.8ckt Build 6 is concerned, it is free for private
use, comes with an enhanced version of PGPdisk, and a version of
Samopal's PGP-ICQ that is linked to the binary of the build AND full
source code has been issued.  It runs faster than the old NAI PGP
6.5.8, is compatible with GnuPG keys (which the old NAI PGP was not)
and most of all, it is supported, whereas the NAI version has been
abandoned by NAI.

I'm surprised by that because the CKT builds of PGP have been around
to my knowledge since PGP 5.x and Imad is both well respected and well

about 5 years.
With the failure of NAI to support PGP 6.5.8, but this being the last
version for which any SDKs to allow integration with emailers has been
issued by NAI, the time was ripe for an enhanced version of PGP 6.5.8
to be produced, and Imad has successfully done that.

Hi there, pplf,
On 08 July 2001, I received the following message from you regarding

This may have been the reason the early ckt builds were built, but it
is not the main reason now and although you CAN create big keys the
documentation now warns against it.
PRZ asked that big keys not be used and warned against the use of
experimental code, he did not specifically state that CKT builds
should not be used.  In fact your own quote goes on:
This is part of the reason
why we ask people not to release code changes on their own, but to send them
to us, so that we may incorporate some of them (if they seem like good ideas)
into our next product release.  That is how PGP enhancements from the user
community have always been managed since PGP source code was released in
END QUOTE
but PGP 6.5.8 is no longer supported by NAI.  Those of us who use
e-mailers other than those for which NAI has written plug-ins are
forced to use PGP 6.5.8, but PGP 6.5.8ckt has security enhancements
and additional algorithms incuded and sharpen up the code.  There is
no "next product release" for us and until NAI issue the SDK for PGP
7.x.x I will happily use PGP 6.5.8ckt
That's a sweeping statement.  Certainly some GnuPG/PGP Users might not.
But the PGP-Basics group at Yahoo, does (where people are abandoning
PGP 7.x.x for PGP 6.5.8ckt), and the Becky Users PGP Forum does, both
of which I moderate
I am happy to debate this  forever, but I think its getting a bit OT. My earlier point has not been answered: how about inviting Imad into
the OpenPGP WG where we can all benefit from his input?

Yes, but I don't know ANYBODY who uses KMail!  My own mailer (Becky!2)
handles this well, but the fact is that nearly ALL of the MUAs in
Windows weren't designed to be used with PGP/GnuPG and it is a fact
that with PGP 7.x the only plugins that are available have been
written by NAI and they have not released the source code or SDKs so
nobody can write plug-ins for PGP 7.x
This is a good reason for changing to GnuPG, but most uses would
prefer to stay with an MUA that works and use an outside program to
interface with it as well as GnuPG.  If this results in bad signatures
because of bad word wrap, then people will not use GnuPG.
And there is no point suggesting to Windows users that they use
PGP/MIME. Most MUAs that support it do not do so to RFC2015, and
Windows users are rightly worried about attachments arriving in their
mail.  Clearsigning is the norm in Windows, and many discussion lists
won't accept attachments....

Here we go...
PGP/MIME is a function of the mailer, not of GPG or PGP, and of those
mailers in Windows that support PGP/MIME most do as a result of the PGP
plugin that comes with PGP that changes the mailer, not PGP.
Until recently, with the advent of PGP 7.x those plugins were not
PGP/MIME compliant to RFC 2015; unfortunately most people who know what
they are about in the Windows PGP environment prefer to use PGP 6.5.8 or
the unofficial PGP 6.5.8ckt which come with plugins that are not wholly
compatible with RFC2015.
You get the example of Eudora which used PGP/MIME of a kind that only
other Eudora users could verify or decrypt.
That is not to say that some PGP compatible mailers come with a suitable
PGP/MIME extension (eg. Becky with its PGPB2 plugin) that is compatible
to RFC2015, but by and large it is best not to use PGP/MIME with Windows
PGP users.
Most mailing lists strip attachments that are a feature of PGP/MIME and
many Windows users automatically delete attachments unless they are sure
of them for fear of viruses.
PGP/MIME is not the correct version of PGP if your message cannot be
decrypted or verified; take my advise and use inline PGP coding for ALL

As I wrote to you separately, you can carry on using PGP/MIME but most
Windows PGP/GPG users wont be able to decrypt/verify it.  And there is
the case that many PGP/GPG Windows users AUTOMATICALLY delete
attachments unless they come from a known source.
So if you want your encrypted or signed messages to be decrypted or
verified by most people, use inline coding, not PGP/MIME.
PGP/MIME is a feature of the mailer, not PGP or GPG, and many mailer
plugins do not generate PGP/MIME to RFC2015, in Windows at least.  Until
they do carry this capability, you are simply banging your head against
a closed door......

That is principally because there is no version of PGP in Windows that
is XP compatible, because NAI stopped supporting it before an XP version
was released.  It MIGHT work with XP but that doesn't mean it will work
in all aspects. Plugins that come with PGP 7.x are the only ones stated
by NAI to support PGP/MIME to RFC 2015.  PGP 7.x has not been issued
with any source code and has had an SDK issued which most observers say
cannot be used by third party vendors to write plugins for PGP 7.x,
consequently the only ones available are written by NAI who no longer
support them.
PGP 6.x (expecially PGP 6.5.8) was released with plugins that were not
PGP/MIME compatible to RFC2015, because the RFC had not been agreed at
that time.  It is, however, the last version which had an SDK issued so
that third party vendors could write PGP plugins, and that is why so
many support it.  But it does not produce PGP/MIME in the mailer to RFC2015.
So it is better not to use PGP/MIME when using XP anyway, and far from
certain that the PGP/MIME with any version of PGP will be RFC2015
compliant.  And as PGP/MIME is a function of the mailer, not of PGP,
ONLY use PGP/MIME where you are CERTAIN that the recipient's mailer is
RFC2015 compatible.
That, as far as I am concerned, means using PGP/MIME only with Becky2
users with the PGPB2 plugin in Windows and using PGP 6.5.9 or PGP
6.5.8ckt.  Other than that, use PGP/GPG coding inline.

On Saturday 16 March 2002 12:13 am, you uttered these words of widom regarding GnuPG in Linux... a little help for a Windoze user?:
The latest version of PGP that has been released for Linux is PGP 6.5.8, and then only for the commandline.  GPG is also a commandline program.  In fact, there is nothing in Linux approaching the flexibility and functions of PGP with the GUI (nor may I add, I've not come across anything even approaching GPGShell [a Windows front end for GPG] in Linux).
The reason for this is mainly the key management functions, which are (sadly) missing from most front ends in Linux, and the ability to encrypt/sign/decrypt/verify text in a window having the focus.
The nearest thing that there is to it is to use an emailer like Kmail, Evolution, or Xfmail with built in support for PGP and GPG, but of course these will only deal with encryption/ signing/ decryption/ verification, not with key management.  There are some front ends that will enable you to keep your keyrings up to date, Seahorse and Geheimnis amongst them and they are useful to have about, but not

First of all, get the latest version of GPG and look and set up the=20

it you are using Windows, so get the version of GPG at=20

Unless you're familiar with the Dos box, I'd suggest that you get a GUI=20
front end.  This will help you access the functions of GPG through a=20
graphical interface, and here you have two options; WinPT or GPGShell. =20
Although it is not open source, I would favour GPGShell as its more=20
like PGP's interface and a little more mature, and some of your users=20
might find it easier to use.  Links to both programs are on the=20
nullify.org site.
If you want an email program that is easy to use and integrates well=20
with GPG, I would go for Enigmail.  This is a Mozilla project that=20
makes Mozilla Mail integrate with GPG and has PGP/MIME capabilities. =20
However, I would not use it with Mozilla, but with Beonex Communicator,=20
which is an end-user version of Mozilla, is much easier to use, and=20
more secure.  You can get it at : and you will find most Mozilla projects are compatible with it.
However Enigmail is merely an extension of the inbuilt mailer: all the=20

You need to update your trust database (trustdb) to make sure the keys=20
you are using have a level of trust associated with them.
Enigmail, by default, sends a message through to GnuPG to "trust all=20
keys", which is a dangerous (if convenient) route to go down.
The best way would be to import your pubring.gpg and secring.gpg into=20
gpg itself, but you could use KGPG to help you.  Once the trust is=20

Unless you want to comunicate with the keyowner and send him/her a=20

@_subject: gnupg encrypted mail and malware/spam 
And I think you are missing the point.  A virus is (by definition) a
piece of code that executes automatically once it is on your system.
However, Windows is an OS that is designed to automatically execute
code: its one of its inherant properties and one its main security
weaknesses.  It is the reason why a number of mailing lists do not allow
attachments and why many users delete attachments when they come from an
unknown source.
Encrypted code cannot be executed automatically, and provided you take
certain security measure (always run an attachment through a virus
filter, for instance, or a trojan filter, before opening it) you should
be safe.  Or you can opt to use an OS which doesn't execute code
automatically, such as Linux.  Many Linux based email servers do, in
fact, scan for Windows viruses, but its up to the individual user to
protect his own system.
The original poster was asking whether spammers could use encryption to
get round spam checking.  As was pointed out, the additional resources
in time and effort would not make it worth it, and for the message to
get through to the recipient they would have to harvest vast numbers of
keys, which though technically feasible is impractical.  However using
an MUA based Beysian spam filtering system (such as that in Mozilla Mail
from version 1.3) you can easily filter for spam once decryption has
taken place and before the message is opened.
It all boils down to whether GPG should protect users who can't be
bothered to protect themselves :)

I don't: I think its more to do with the nature of users.
Most people I know get a computer for access to the internet and they do=20
not want to bother with much else. New Windows users are blissfully=20
unaware that there is any other OS and they simply want the machine to=20
do everything it is capable of from power up: they do not want to=20
bother with the "how".  Linux users and Mac users are generally more=20
questioning because they have decided that they are not going to accept=20
the defaults offered.  Even so, it is remarkable how many people are=20
convinced AOL is "the internet".....
Most users wouldn't recognise a "threat model" if it jumped up and bit=20
them, and the majority don't care and have no interest in finding out. =20
Here in the UK, ISPs are required to monitor all internet traffic and=20
to pass on anything which is flagged as suspicious to the "relevant=20
authorities".  Most computer users in the UK do not see this as an=20
attack on personal liberty or their right to privacy, just part and=20
parcel of using the internet.  Many MUAs have encryption installed,=20
even if it is only S/MIME, and this certainly applies to Outlook=20
Express and even the Netscape email client.  Very few people use it=20
even so.
The most we can do is help that minority of users who do want to use GPG=20

This is the very point that Phil Zimmerman underlined in the early days=20
of PGP.  By encrypting only sensitive stuff you single out the=20
sensitive stuff and people only need to use their resources to tackle=20
those emails.  If you encrypt everything then you do not single out the=20
sensitive stuff.
But this requires encryption technology to be used by the recipient, be=20
it PGP, GnuPG or S/MIME, and most don't bother.  Its not a matter of=20
difficulty (from my perspective PGP and GnuPG are easy to use, and=20
S/MIME is freely available and even the certificates are free [from=20
Trustcenter.GB and Thawte]); they just can't be bothered to use the=20
tools and to understand how they work.  So the encrypted emails can't=20
be read and are ignored.
Its not so much a cultural gap, as computer illiteracy.  Many users just=20
want to press the power button and instantly be in touch with email,=20
usenet, or the web; even my wife gets frustrated waiting for files to=20
download and we're on cable broadband!  These users don't want to know=20

switch.  This is (after all) how they are sold their computer systems:=20
all completely ready to go once they've pressed the power button, even=20
though it might not be completely accurate.
ALL security software, from firewalls through virus checkers, and=20
encryption software are often seen by this type of user as complicating=20
