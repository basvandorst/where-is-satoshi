@_subject: Handling of User Ids containing non ascii characters 
recently I had some trouble importing a key generated by NAI PGP 7.0
with an user id containing non ascii characters, namely the German
umlaut "ö".
These are the observations (The user id as showed by NAI PGP
is "Peter Knöll ...."):
1. gpg --list-keys shows "Peter Kn\x6cl ...." as user id,
   i.e., ö -> \x6c
2. There is one "l" missing in the user id as displayed by gnupg.
3. The string "Peter Kn\x6cl ..." does not match any given key
     when used as recipient in gpg -r As far as I can see RFC2440 allows utf8 encoded unicode characters
in the user id. I cannot judge whether the encoding is correct
in the original key.
Thanks for any hint! I am using gnupg 1.0.4.

Here is the key:

Version: PGP 7.0
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
