@_subject: Testing WKD setup? 
Hello list,
I have implemented WKD for my domain, but now I don?t know an easy way
of testing it ? is there a service or similar where I can check if this
email address is properly WKD-enabled?
Thank you.

@_subject: WKD: Publishing a key for multiple user IDs 
Under ?security considerations? the current WKD draft says:
So if I have two email addresses/user IDs me at my.org and me2 at my.org
associated with the same key, I cannot just export the key and publish
it, right? I have to somehow publish two different ?stripped? public
Is there documentation somewhere how to produce the keys for both these
user IDs with GnuPG? (I don?t think the Python generate scripts do this
properly, or do they?)
