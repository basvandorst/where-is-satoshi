@_subject: How to import an existing key in GPG 
I imported an existing GPG key to another GPG environment but I am not able
to use it for the decryption, it gives an error that the "secret key is not
Do I need to export the existing key in some special way and import it with
any different command so that the secret key is also imported in the new GPG
and I am able to use the old key.
Please help.
