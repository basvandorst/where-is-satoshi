When I am exproting the key to .asc file it is exporting correctly.
C:\gnupg\gpg.exe --homedir "C:\clear\keyrings" --armour --output "Key.asc"
--export "tanik"
Then I have imported as below
C:\keyrings>C:\gnupg\gpg.exe --homedir . --import Key.asc
gpg: keyring `.\secring.gpg' created
gpg: keyring `.\pubring.gpg' created
gpg: .\trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: key B8C78A4F: public key "tanik" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
But when I try to import from from --import I am getting keys only I am not
getting the secrect keys
C:\keyrings>C:\working\gnupg\gpg.exe --homedir c:\mlclear\keyrings

Hi Joseph,
By using this option also I could not able to get the secret keys in that..
Hash: SHA256
You didn't indicate which version of GnuPG you're using. Earlier versions required the addition of the "--allow-secret-key-import"  From the man page of version 1.4.1:
        --allow-secret-key-import
                  This is an obsolete option and is not used anywhere.

After creation of the key I forgot the pasword for that key.
Is there any way that I can get the password again.

Hi Werner,
Sorry for disturbing u again.. Iam facing problem in --sign-keys for 1.4.1.
When I used the --sign-key in 1.2.x it is generating  sig 3 keys as below
But I am not getting the sig 3 keys in 1.4.1.
1.4.1 is having any problem in --sign-key

We fixed such a renaming error in 1.4.1 (look for an exe file as it
now comes with an installer).
