@_subject: Netscape Certificates, RSA Keys, and GPG? 
Just want to convert the keys so GPG/PGP could be used to digitally sign =
various documents.
I can even extract the private and public keys from the certificate into a =
PEM-style (ascii armored) text block.  The trouble is this block doesn't =
conform to the OpenPGP message format standard.
So it looks like the challenge now is how do I extract the numerical =
portions of the key (E, N, and D) from the RSA message and repackage it as =
an OpenPGP message....if that's even possible.
Do you want to convert only the keys, or also the certificates?

@_subject: Signature Packet Format 
Hey folks,
I'm writing a little application to generate an OpenPGP message with a =
user's RSA public/private key for import into gpg.  I noticed that GPG =
won't import the key without a valid self-signature.
However, the RFC sections regarding the signature packet format are a =
little unclear to me.
My understanding of Version 4 signatures of RSA keys is as follows - any =
clarifications/corrections are appreciated.
1)  Hash the key packet you are protecting.
2)  Hash the User ID packet
3)  Hash the Signature packet through the hashed subpacket data, but no =
4)  Hash the 6-byte trailer
5)  Insert the 160-bit hash value into an ASN.1 DigestInfo structure
....now what?
The spec indicates that the "signature" portion of the packet for the RSA =
algorithm is an MPI of m**d (which I assume is the modulus raised to the =
private exponent).  But there's no indication of where the m**d value and =
the ASN.1 DigestInfo structure meet in order to form a secure signature.
I *know* I"m missing something because this just doesn't make sense as a =
cryptographically secure signature.  Anyone able to clarify for me?

@_subject: Groups/Organizations Using GPG/OpenPGP? 
Anyone happen to know of any companies, groups, organizations, etc., that =
use gpg/OpenPGP as their PKI or Cryptography solution?
I have the interesting task of trying to convince our VP that gpg/OpenPGP =
is a viable basis for an enterprise solution...and given that "Freeware" =
and "open source" are curse words in the executive world I could use some =
case studies :)

@_subject: Version 4 Key IDs in Secret Key Packets 
Hey folks, quick question --
In order to calculate Key IDs/Fingerprints for public keys stored within a =
secret key packet, does gpg...
1)  Hash the secret key packet format (i.e. tag value of 0x95, etc)
2)  Hash a "virtual" public key packet (i.e. tag value of 0x99, adjust =
length octets to be the length of public key data only, etc)
Thanks! :)
And thanks for the great responses to my other questions recently.

@_subject: Netscape Certificates, RSA Keys, and GPG? 
Got an odd situation here ;)
My company issues personal certificates (for use by Netscape and IE) as =
part of our PKI services.  We're currently trying to extend that infastruct=
ure to support digital signatures, and guess who gets to develop it? ;)
The short of it is, we're using RSA keypairs in these signed certificates. =
 I can extract the RSA public and private keys using openssl's pkcs12 and =
x509 libraries, but neither GPG nor PGP seem to like the resulting =
pem-formatted RSA keypair.
Any suggestions for how to import these RSA keys into gpg (highly =
preferred) or pgp?  I'm not even quite sure what problems I"m running =
into, as I'm not intimately familiar with the PEM message format that =
gpg/pgp are attempting to parse.
Thanks for any advice,
