just want to let you know that using the latest gpgex-1.0.0-beta24 on a
german windows 7 professional sp1 64bit system leads to some strange
context menus [1].
Using beta19 doesn't translate the context menu to german but the
context menu is not broken.

thanks for your reply.
My windows version here is 6.1.7601.
I've installed gpg4win-2.1.1.exe which fails to register the gpgex and
then installed the gpgex from the archive:
with the regsrv32 command as an admin.
I'm using the default codepage Deutsch (Deutschland) of a German win7
Just checked my environment variables with SET and none of the above is
set. If you need the whole output of SET i can send it to you via a
direct e-mail.
