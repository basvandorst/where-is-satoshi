@_subject: Creating RSA key 
I am trying to create a 1024 RSA key using the latest version of GnuPG
(GnuPG) 1.0.3.  However, if I use the --gen-key command I don't get an
options to create an RSA key.  What do I need to do to create an RSA key.

@_subject: Use of RSA keys in Gnupg 
I am trying to use RSA keys in gpg but without success. I created an RSA key pair in PGP, exported both keys and imported both to
gpg. The result of the import is:
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: key F4497081: secret key imported
gpg: key F4497081: public key imported
gpg: key F4497081: secret and public key don't match
gpg: Total number processed: 2
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
gpg:   secret keys imported: 1
The message that secret and public key don't match was worrying. Anyway I
encrypted a file using this RSA key which worked fine but when I tried to
decrypted it I get the following:
Ok ignore the insecure memory mgs. We heard enough about it... gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: protection algorithm 1 is not supported
gpg: encrypted with 1024-bit RSA key, ID F4497081, created 2000-10-18
      "roman stark "
gpg: public key decryption failed: unknown cipher algorithm
gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available
However, using PGP to decrypt the file, which was encrypted with GPG work
just fine.  Does anybody have any ideas as to why the decryption does not

I posted this a few days ago once, does anybody have any ideas?  I still
have not been successful at using an RSA key to decrypt in gpg.
