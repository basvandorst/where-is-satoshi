Thanks! :)
Jup, that's right - but what's an invalid key?  Maybe a broken key?
Maybe a key PGP doesn't understand fully?  Maybe a bug in PGP?  Maybe a
not validated key (whatever PGP means with this)?
It would have been clear if PGP had said something like: "Can't change
trust on keys *which are not signed by trusted keys*".  Because after
all, the reason PGP refuses to change the trust of the key is because
it's not signed.
No, I'll still say that the error message is confusingly inaccurate.
"validate a key"?  Uhm?  That can be anything!  I validated the key
because I created it on the same computer and I transfered it to PGP
just a split second later.  So the key is validated.  And still PGP
refuses to change the trust because it cannot know this.
I don't.  It's completely my problem which way I handle this - ie. first
signing and afterwards chaning the trust or the other way around.
But ranting about bad error messages of PGP on a GPG is "slightly"

And I would suspect quite the opposite, as those users who are unfortunate

Also quite some web freemail systems do not support filtering on anything
else than subject.
For those who are fortunate enough, there's always the way of using procmail
to do away with the subject prefix.  For those, a subject prefix would not
be much harm, but for people who cannot use procmail, it would add quite
some value.
However, please don't be so selfish and assume that anyone can use good
software.  Sometimes it's simply not a matter of choice.

Dunno how The Bat! does it, but if I were to write a mail client which
supports GnuPG, I'd save the message and invoke GnuPG with the saved
message.  The result of this (the signed saved message) I'd put in the body
of the mail, add apropriate headers (ie. Content-Type: multipart/signed) and
mail all this.
This way no tampering would be done - neither be GnuPG nor by the MUA.
Then it should be signed after it's wrapped.
Hmm, dunno how it's in the Windows world - I'd assume that hitting the send
button causes the message to be signed and send.

Well, no, but the point is, that a signature wouldn't have ment anything

Hmm, well, to be honest, I did not think about it this way.  Well, it
sounds logical for me, when you say that a signed mail makes you believe
in it more.
Let's take Werner as an example again.  I (and I suppose the vast
majority of people here and on the net) don't know him personally.  All
we know is that there's a person (? well, we suppose so *G*) writing a
program called GnuPG and that this person signs the source files of this
program with the name "Werner Koch".  Now, do we know that there
actually is a "Werner Koch"?  No, we don't.  And thinking about it - I
could care less if there's a real-life person called "Werner Koch".  I
know that there's a net person who likes to call himself that way, and
that's sufficient.
Wrt. to the signed source files, it is sufficient because there's a
large number of files signed with the same key.
But this level of sufficiency (let's call it "trust") is not always good
enough.  In an ideal world, GnuPG/PGP signatures would be legal binding.
For this to happen though, this marginal trust isn good enough.  If
he'd buy something from me and sign his order with his GnuPG key, I'd
demand better/higher trust.  You get the idea.
a) sorry for the long mail, but now I do understand you
b) uhm, I forgot what I wanted to say as "b)" *G*
Well, please leave it up to me how I behave/think.  Thanks :)  Anyhow, I
suppose you're right, though.
