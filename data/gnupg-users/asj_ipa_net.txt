@_subject: Weaknesses in SHA-1  
I would be curious if anyone knows what the commercial PGP app supports
also for a good comparison.  I think it would be helpful not just for
rumored weaknesses, but for over all compatibility knowledge.  Maybe an
ongoing table we could keep current.
I know t hat SHA-1 has been analyzed more then SHA256, SHA384, or SHA512
thus could actually be stronger.  However why not let people create keys
with those algorithms also in 1.4?
On a side note I know that the 1.3.x series will become the new stable 1.4.
 However I was wondering when we would see the first builds that actually
said  1.4 come along?  I figure we will see a much more use of that build
series when it actually says 1.4.

Sorry, wrong wording on the hash/key thing.... let me restate.
Previously you stated that 1.2.x supports MD5, SHA1, and RIPEMD160 and
read-only support for SHA256  Also 1.4 will supports MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160,
and SHA256, but only have read only support for SHA384 and SHA512.
Why not allow for full support of SHA384 and SHA512 and not just read-only
support in GnuPG 1.4?

@_subject: GnuPG and MS Outlook 
I was wondering if anyone had a good, easy, and approperate solution for
using GnuPG with MS Outlook 2003?
I was hoping for an interface like Enigmail with Mozilla Thunderbird,
but something that integrates with Outlook.
So far it seems my only options are WinPT and always using text files
(but that still seems to sometimes seems to cause problems and have
e-mails that are not correctly signed).
I would prefer to not use Outlook at all, but my organization is every
much in to MS Exchange so Outlook is really the only option for
corporate stuff.
