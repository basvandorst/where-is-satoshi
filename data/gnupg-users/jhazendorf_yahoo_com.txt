@_subject: determining encryption algorithm 
I can't figure out how to determine the symmetric
encryption algorithm [after the fact] on files that I
receive or have encrypted myself.
I'm guessing pgpdump can't show it because the
algorithm tag is encrypted (using public key
encryption) along with the session/symmetric key.
But gpg --list-packets (which does ask you for your
passphrase) doesn't seem to show that information
Is there any easy way to determine what symmetric
algorithm was used to encrypt files?
