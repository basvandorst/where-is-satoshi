@_subject: symmetric 
Under what circumstances would one want to use
a purely symmetric cipher (ie: gpg -c)?
I can only think of the case where one wants to
encrypt data for safe storage. But, apart from
the reason that more keys equals more security,
why bother, if one already has an assymmetric
keypair (for a hybrid cipher)?
Please reply directly as I am not on the list.

@_subject: signing & encrypting 
In the FAQ ( it says:
  There is a small security glitch in the OpenPGP (and therefore GnuPG)
  system; to avoid this you should always sign and encrypt a message
  instead of only encrypting it.
Can someone provide a one or two sentence explanation as to what this
glitch might be?
If one is to both sign and encrypt a message, would I be correct in
saying that one should encrypt before signing?
Does the order in which --sign and --encrypt are specified on the gpg
command line make a difference to the order in which the corresponding
operations are done?
Any help would be much appreciated.

I was not successful in locating any documentation on MDC.
Can someone point me to the right place, please?

Please forgive my ignorance in the matter, but,
if E(m) is vulnerable to tampering, why isnt E(S(m))?
I understand why S(E(m)) isnt, but with E(S(m)),
it is not obvious to me at all.
Any help would be much appreciated.

Thanks for the reference. I found it a great help.
However, the author does not mention GnuPG.
I presume that this is because in GnuPG signing
and encrypting can be done in a single operation
with the corresponding reverse operation consisting
of a single decryption, thereby preventing a
substitution of the outer layer and the attacks
that that would give rise to, that he discusses.
But, even in GnuPG, if one chose to do the signing
and encrypting in two separate steps, then one
would be vulnerable to the kinds of attacks that
he talks about.
But I'm just a newbie, trying to find my way out
of the woods.
Hopefully, someone more experienced will confirm
or deny.

@_subject: Internal File Structure 
Is there some way to view or list or deduce
the internal structure of a GnuPG file
(eg to find out if it is an encrypted doc or a
signed doc or a signed encrypted doc etc etc)?

Does gpg's symmetric encryption also benefit from
MDC (Modification Detection Code)?

@_subject: Plagiarism 
First party sends clear text to second party
or publishes it for the public at large.
Third party sees the data and claims authorship.
Is it possible to protect against
(third party) plagiarism using gpg alone
short of having to encrypt the data?
PS: Anyone know how this is usually done?
Does one register the data with a lawyer
or a copyright officer or what?
