@_subject: can't connect to `C://Program Files//GNU//GnuPG/S.gpg-agent': No 
Hello! I'm new to this Mailing-List...
When trying to send signed emails with Thunderbird 3.0.4 with Enigmail 1.0.1 and Gpg4Win 2.0.2 on
Windows 7 Ultimate, I always get the error message.
Curiously, the signed and sent with Outlook GpgOL however works perfectly. Therefore, I conclude on
a path or Enigmail problem ...
Does anyone have a solution? What gpg.exe must be used (in witch directory)?
What HomeDir etc. must be set as additional parameter?
The following has been translated from German to English by me...:
The transmission was interrupted.
Error - encryption failed
gpg command line and output:
C:\Program Files\GNU\GnuPG\pub\gpg.exe
can't connect to `C://Program Files//GNU//GnuPG/S.gpg-agent': No such file or directory
can't connect to `C://Program Files//GNU//GnuPG/S.gpg-agent': No such file or directory
gpg: can't connect to the agent: IPC "connect" Call failed
gpg: problem with the agent: agent not running
gpg: skipped "0xC9...": general error
gpg: [stdin]: clearsign failed: general error
The following is from gpg-agent.log-File (parts in german):
