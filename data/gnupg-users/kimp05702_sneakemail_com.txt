@_subject: gpg: WARNING: unsafe ownership on configuration file 
Received the warning message:
gpg: WARNING: unsafe ownership on configuration file after running gpg --version as root. I don't get the warning if I run the same command as a regular user.
Here's the permissions on the file:
jason ls -l .gnupg/gpg.conf
-rw-------  1 jason users 8565 2005-03-17 12:43 .gnupg/gpg.conf
Should I be concerned? I can't find this in the FAQ. I hope it's not a case of not looking hard enough. :-/
