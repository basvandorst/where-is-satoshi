I've been thinking of using gpg, and pgpwireless for my palm, but i have made some unsucessfull tests.
Public key seem to be ok, but private keys are never recognised. in the properties everything is wrong, even the date is 1970, so pgpwireless says corrupt key.
Anyone knows what to do exactly to generate or to export keys for using them on pgpwireless?
Obviusly i don't have Win. to use the win. conduit.
1.2.1 gpg
v2.0 pgpwireless
Thanks a lot.

@_subject: Export of private key ? 
at least for me it works like this
gpg -a --export-secret-keys > FILE.asc
this is exported as armored ascii, (-a)
use --export to export the public one.
i'm trying to convince my self to use gpg too.

I found it in  there's a link to a zipped file. But, i won't
use it, i thougt it could be a good way of storing pgp keys, you can
import them, but noway of exporting except beaming them to another
pgpwireless, it's totally unusable under linux.
I found anyway gnuringkey, wich has with jpilot conduit, a way of storing
armored ascii keys. And it's gpl :-D.
