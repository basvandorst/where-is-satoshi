Hash: SHA1
I'm back and updating my key for new email accounts after a long absence.
But am running a problem and getting the following error.  I did a
Google search but didn't find anything yet.
Could someone please explain what the error means?  And, if there is
obvious place to look for such info that I don't know about, please let
me know where I can look.

Charly, thank you for your reply.  And especially for the direct response.  I forgot to mention that I am on digest mode. (oophs).
Thank you for the link.  I didn't think to look for a "lock" file in ~.gnupg.  I just deleted those files and will try to get the uid updated Is there a "search" page for all the archives?  I have just found a page that lists all the discussions by month.  I think you would need to select and search each month.  That would be tedious.  Doesn't Google index these forums?
I was running the binary MacGPG version 1.4.8 but since my original keys were created using IDEA, I couldn't run it properly.   I tried to compile a  plug-in but that was beyond my limited ability.
Luckily for me, Robert Hansen was able to give me some help and I compiled the complete 1.4.8 with IDEA by myself!!  So right now, I am running v 1.4.8 compiled from source.
Thanks again.
complete, and/or crashed. I very vaguely remember that the crash was due to a missing hash SHA224 (H11); but don't take me to my word, launch Terminal and type gpg -v --version, and see what you get.
a file named secring.gpg.lock or trustdb.gpg.lock, any file with the extension .....gpg.lock. Remove that file, it should solve the problem.
src, or used the binary installer available at

You might also try to add an announcement in the Toronto Area Security
Klatch (TASK) group in LinkedIN.
That's really about it. Hitting up the local LUG mailing lists will get you
the most marketing penetration, seeing as though OpenPGP practices just
aren't ubiquitous outside of the Free Software world. If you have a blog,
posting there might help, especially if it's on a planet that many pay
attention to. You might be able to go to the local colleges and
universities, and hang up fliers in the Computer Science, Mathematics and
other technical college halls. But really, your largest interest is going
to come from LUG mailing lists.

Charly, did you compile with Xcode 5?
I just tried and get an error:
Any suggestions to fix would be appreciated.

Thanks for the quick reply, Charly.
Hmmm.  Yes I used the terminal also.
With the update to 10.8.5, there was an update to Xcode and the Command
Line Tools that you use to compile, make & install.  So that is the only
thing that I can think of that changed on my system.
Michael also replied and he has no problems while using the newer
command line tools from Xcode 5.
For me the compile step works.  But I have no idea why the make step
give so many warnings and then craps out.
Any suggestions of what to try is appreciated.

@_subject: Problems with key available in v1.4.19 but not v2.1.5 
Hello all.
I'm having some problems with my key that was created a long time ago
(1994) but updated with new emails over the years.
I am stuck after searching for an answer so thought I'd ask for some
guidance from the list.  I have reviewed the Docs, Mini Guide and HowTos.
I apologize in advance for the rather lengthy email but I figured I
had to put as much info so you may see what I've tried.
I moved my keys pubring.gpg, secring.pgp and trustdb.gpg to a new Mac
over the past week.
I downloaded and installed MacGPG for the GUI. I only installed the GPG
Keychain, GPG Services and MacGPG.
When I opened the GPG Keychain, all the keys were on the screen for a
brief moment and then the list shrunk and many keys disappeared in
addition to my personal public and secret keys. ???
So panic set in and I restored my pubring and secring from backup and
deleted the install of MacGPG.  I thought maybe there was a problem
with MacGPG so best to go back to command line Gnupg.
I installed 2.1.5 from source and found none of my keys in the
pubring and secring. What???
So I downloaded and installed 1.4.19, restored the pubring and secring
from backup again and found my public and secret keys are now listed.
This time I generated a revoke just in case and to test the install.
1.4.19 works fine.
Now I re-ran 2.1.5 and tried to find my keys.  Again they've gone
missing. [# gpg2 --list-keys]  None of my keys (pub and sec) are
available in 2.1.5.
Re-running [gpg --list-keys] with 1.4.19 and my keys are still there.
Why would v1.4.19 show my pub and sec keys but v2.1.5 wouldn't?  I
presume this is something very basic but I'm stumped.  I thought v1.x
and v2.x keys were interoperable??
Thanks in advance for any guidance,
PS I'm on digest mode so would appreciate if you could cc me directly on
any reply.  Thanks.

Thank you, Robert.  I'll revoke the old one and create a new.
I'll need to do some reading of the docs but just curious if there is
there a way to move the trust rating from the old cert to the newly
created one other than ask those who signed to resign?
Thanks again,

@_subject: [slightly off topic] e-courier.ca 
Hello all.
Over the past couple of days I've read a discussion in my association
about a "secure" email service located in Canada.
I put "secure" in quotes as they talk about a "proprietary" encryption
algorithm.  As soon as I read "proprietary", I have to roll my eyes as I
don't necessarily trust encryption if it isn't open for everyone to verify.
Has anyone here tried, verified or used this service?
Is this similar to what has been discussed as a potential use or service
by GnuPG?  The service isn't seamless but perhaps would make sense as an
offering by GnuPG/Werner?

Thank you, Juan.  I didn't see your helpful comments until I read the
digest this morning.
I appreciate everyone's help.
