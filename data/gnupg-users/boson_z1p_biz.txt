@_subject: keytocard: bad secret key 
I'm trying to save a 4096 bit RSA key to my OpenPGP smartcard v2.0 but I get an error about a "bad secret key".
I use Ubuntu 10.04 with a self-compiled GnuPG 2.0.19
Verbose-mode doesn't tell more details and according to Google I am the only one with that problem...
Does anyone know what's wrong?
