@_subject: gnupg and agora.cgi 
Can anyone offer me advice on my problem?  I just set up agora.cgi on one of
my servers.  I want to use gnupg in conjunction with agora to encrypt order
emails it sends out.  Now, when I try to place an order, gnupg doesn't
return any data and the mail is not encrypted.
I haven't done anything with gnupg other than install it on my machine.  The
machine is a server, so all it has to do is use public keys to encrypt the
messages as they go out.  Do I need to import public key files?
any help would be appreciated.

@_subject: installing gnupg on a server 
Could someone point me in the right direction?  I am looking to install
gnupg on a web server for use as a way for my hosting customers to send
encrypted emails via their web forms.  How would I install gnupg to do this?
I ran the standard install, and now I get errors when trying to send
encrypted emails via web forms.
Does gnupg need to be running all the time on the server, or can it be
called via a script?
any help would be appreciated.
