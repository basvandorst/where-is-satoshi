gnupg/po/de.glo should help
 -passphrase: Mantra, Passphrase
This has been changed recently from Mantra to Passphrase, because the
meaning of "Mantra" is not very well known.

I'am working on it.
... "Westeurop?ische Normalzeit" does not come from the gnupg translation,
but from Sir Windows himself. You can judge it from the use of the term
"Westeurop?ische Normalzeit" (Westeuropean mean time) for the timezone
used in Germany. But thats wrong. It has to be "Mitteleurop?ische Zeit"
(Central European time). However, the Umlaut is still wrong.
