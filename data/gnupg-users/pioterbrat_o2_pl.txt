@_subject: Trust list  
I'm trying to use gpgme to list my trustlist, but this code doesn't work:
Or I'm doing something wrong. I have in my gpg 4 keys but none of them is listed by this program. Am I missing something??

@_subject: gpg trust from command line  
I need to invoke trust command but from linux shell. I was thinking that this will do:
gpg --edit host_name trust 3
to set my trust marginal for host_name, but it didn't, it took me to the gpg command line.
I need this becouse I'm currently writing program that is using gpg. It's in C so making it to write to stdin of gpg would be a lot of fuss, as a command line I can simply use system function.
So my question is is it possible?? If yes how??

HAVE_CONFIG_H
     I have this code. And when I see output owner_trust = 4, but in gpg from system I get 0. Do I need to somehow save this changes??
 "t-support.h"
main (int argc, char **argv)
 gpgme_ctx_t ctx;
 gpgme_error_t err;
 gpgme_key_t key;
 const char* key_t;
 init_gpgme(GPGME_PROTOCOL_OpenPGP);
 err = gpgme_new(&ctx);
 err = gpgme_op_keylist_start(ctx,NULL,0);
 int i = 0;
 char *key_sig;
 while(!(err = gpgme_op_keylist_next (ctx,&key))) {
  if(key->owner_trust==0)
  {
  key->owner_trust=GPGME_VALIDITY_FULL;
  fprintf(stderr,"%i : Key owner= %s fingerprint= %s trust=   }
 }
