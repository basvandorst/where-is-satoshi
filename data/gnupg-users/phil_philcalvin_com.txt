@_subject: Proof of possession when exchanging keys 
Hash: SHA1
I seem to recall reading somewhere that when exchanging keys in
person, you should not only have the person verify the key
fingerprint, but you should also present them with 1) an unpredictable
challenge document to sign or 2) verify that they can decrypt an
encrypted message using the key in question. This would ensure they
have access to the secret half of the keypair in question.
Is verifying proof of possession necessary or good practice, or is
checking fingerprints (and, when you don't know the person, photo ID
or similar) enough?

That makes perfect sense. That's the approach I took on the most recent key I signed.
What attacks are mitigated by verifying control of the secret key, though? I am having a hard time grokking the benefit for someone whose ID you have verified to present and fingerprint a key which she does not control.
There is the possibility of an external party replacing the exchanged key with another, but doesn't the fingerprint adequately protect against that?
