The secret key is secring.gpg in your home directory of .gnupg. You can copy the key file to a floppy. I usually use tar to backup the .gnupg directory, and move it to another computer. This works with different versions of BSD just fine for me on different computers.
Good luck, Eric Buchanan

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
I just used tar and gpg to encrypt the file as shown earlier, and it decrypted fine, but when I went to untar it, I got this error:
tar: Skipping to next header
tar: Archive contains obsolescent base-64 headers
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors
This is version 1.4.0 on FreeBSD 4.11. It only decrypts the first tiny bit of the decrypted tar archive. It also repeated the exact same error messages when I ran "gpg -r root  --encrypt-files -sta b.tar" and then after decrypting I run  "tar xvf b.tar." My OpenBSD installation is hosed right now so I can't try repeating this on another platform. Any ideas? TIA,

I meant to say "untar" instead of "decrypts only a tiny bit of the archive."

@_subject: Shell script question for GnuPG on FreeBSD 
Hash: SHA1
Hello all,
I'm trying to migrate a shell script to use gnupg instead of PGP 5.0i on FreeBSD.  I can't seem to convert this line:
pgpe -r root -sta (long list of files to encrypt with one command.)
Is there any easy way to do this with gnupg? My efforts to change it reading the man page aren't working.
gpg --encrypt-files -r root -sta (long list of files to encrypt with one command.) doesn't work with multiple files, but it does with single files.
I want to use gnupg once in the script  to encrypt a large number of large files in one directory with just one command. I need to access these files on Windows XP and OpenBSD so I use ascii armoring.
Any help would be appreciated.
Eric Buchanan

Right you are about the man page. I piped the whole man page into an .asc file, and searched through it with Xemacs. I have got it working with multifile as long as I drop the -s.
