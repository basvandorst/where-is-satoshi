@_subject: gpgcom compiled ? 
Is there an all ready compiled version
of gpgcom anywhere ?  The readme in the gpgme 0.2.3 tarball mentions it, but
I couldn't find it : (

@_subject: How do I supply a password and decrypt on NT 
Check out It's LGPL'd but it's better than nothing. It wraps the Windows GnuPG
Binaries so one
can call functions from VB or any other language.  The VB sample isn't the
best, but I'm
working on them.  It is being developed as a cooperative effort to get the
Aid industry in the US to use strong, open-source encryption to protect
customer's privacy.

Thanks for the help, but unfortunately I do not know C and we do not do any
C code in the office.  Programming wise, vb is the only option available in
the office.

@_subject: Will GPG use Dual Processors under Windows ? 
Looks like I'll have to live with it.
The industry specs I need to adhere to require
compression (using gpg) and 3des.  I am intrigued
by the idea of running multiple instances of
GPG on different processors, though.

It does not.  There are some things you might try to speed up the
process, though.  First of all, if you turn off compression, you save
some CPU time, though at the cost of a larger file size.  Secondly,
choose your ciphers with care.  Don't use 3DES if you can possibly
avoid it.  While it is the most highly thought of in terms of
security, it is also the slowest cipher by far.
Note that you can take advantage of multiple CPUs if you split up the
work intelligently - for example, say you want to encrypt and
compress.  If you have GnuPG encrypt, and a different program compress
then you can keep both CPUs busy.  Also, if you break your 10 gig file
into 2 5 gig files, then you can run two instances of GnuPG at once.

I wish it was an FTP problem : (  It was emailed from site to site
as an attachment.  A few people have mentioned canonical text mode,
would that help me out here ?

      The financial aid industry in the US uses OpenPGP to secure file
transmissions and we've built our systems around GPG.  Everything has
worked great so far, but we just encountered a problem with one of our
schools who is using GPG on VMS.  If they encrypt a text file that contains
CR-LF's the decryption fails.  Has any else encountered this ?

@_subject: Is there a way to decrypt, but not decompress ? 
I'm just blue skying here, but it would save
me a lot of hastle if I could decrypt and check the sig
on an archive but not decompress the message.  When
we ship data up to our mainframe we sometimes have bandwidth issues and moving the compressed message
would help me there.  Is this possible from the GPG commandline ?
PS. I'm using the MingW32 binaries on NT

OK, dumb question : Shouldn't that be HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE ?
