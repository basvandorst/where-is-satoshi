@_subject: Get signatures from a keyring file 
My question is how I can export the signatures from the keyring file. The answer I am looking for, is not the command "check" because I want to extract the actual signature.
I had an idea to convert the keyring to ascii and parse it, but i dont know the format of file so I cannot do it.
Thank you.
