@_subject: gpg: conversion from `utf-8' to `CP437' not available (WinXP) 
I am new to Gnupg, I have downloaded gnupg-w32cli-1.4.0a.zip and verified  the checksum. I have created a directory as indicated in the manual and  copied the gpg.exe file and launched it from the dos command line:
gpg: conversion from `utf-8' to `CP437' not available
did I miss something somewhere???
Merry christmas and happy new year,
