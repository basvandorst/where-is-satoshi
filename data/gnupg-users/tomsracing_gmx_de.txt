@_subject: GnuPG + GPA + GdataPlugin Problems 
Hello All,
just downloaded the Gdata Plugin with GnuPG + GPA and installed it on Win98SE with Outlook2000 and Win2000Pro with Outlook2000. Both installations show a error dialog after key generation saying "no valid private key". The main window says that I just succesfully generated a key. This happens if I want to generate a backup key automatically and specify a directory. The info box for the generation of a backup key also states that two files are created: a public and a secret file. I only get the public part generated in the specified directory!
The error message is not there if I choose to create a backup key later. How do I create a backup of the secret key with GPA? Thanks for any help,
