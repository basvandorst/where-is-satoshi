I realize that this probabily has something to do with the RSA algorithm, but how can I verify/decrypt messages made with pgp 2.x?

I'm running RedHat Linux 7.1 and updated via rpm.
After "upgrading" (rpm -Uvh --force gnupg*.rpm) from the RedHat CD-ROM back to
version 1.0.4-11 everything works fine. Thanks, Kent
