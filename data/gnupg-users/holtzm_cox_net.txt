Just tried to d/l a key and was greeted with
[holtzm at localhost]~$ sudo gpg --recv --keyserver pgp.mit.edu [sudo] password for holtzm:
gpg: WARNING: unsafe ownership on configuration file gpg: external program calls are disabled due to unsafe options file gpg: keyserver communications error: general error
gpg: keyserver receive failed: general error
I have downloaded keys from this server before with no problems. The ownership on the file in question is
-rw------- 1 holtzm holtzm 9419 2008-10-04 21:58 ./.gnupg/gpg.conf
If this is not correct what should I use? Tried making it root and got
gpg: WARNING: unsafe enclosing directory ownership on configuration file gpg: external program calls are disabled due to unsafe options file gpg: keyserver communications error: general error
gpg: keyserver receive failed: general error
Does "enclosing directory" refer to /home/holtzm? What ownership and permissions should be used?
Again, I recently downloaded a key from this server with no problem. I'm at a loss.

It's a bad habit I got into when I started using ubuntu. Running the command from my user account worked. I may have to stick with debian.
Thanks for pointing out my problem.

Your INSTALL file says:
"The configure script will look for your gpg2 binary......"
Is gpg2 required or will it work with older versions ie 1.4.6?

I disagree. I get the impression that it's mostly a matter of their fear
of not being able to comprehend it. After all, it is a "computer thing".

Try telling this to a noob who is:
a) convinced that only a nefarious low life has a use for encryption
b) afraid of and distrusts computers
c) convinced he/she is right and logic won't sway him/her.

Still with the HTML? This excerpt is from the Fedora mail list but it

No HTML Mail, Please
Set your mailer to send only plain text messages to the list (How? ).
Why? HTML is designed for web pages, not emails, and uses a lot more
bandwidth. Many list members actually block HTML because it is used for
malicious code.
Not only does HTML mail be used to run malicious scripts, but when using

Just as an aside, I have, among others, ubuntu 12.04 on my box running
straight Gnome3. Chromium runs without a hitch. No time to check

If what you say is true, it sounds like a Suse problem, not a Gnome one.

Dream on.
There are quite a few ways police and prosecutors can coerce a suspect
to hand over his encryption key(s). Dangling the prospect of a lighter
sentence under the poor bugger's nose, or conversely, threatening to
come down hard, perhaps going for a death penalty. The surrender of a
suspect's keys would be "voluntary" and therefore constitutional. Even if
the role production serves is testimonial, if it's voluntary, and the
statement the poor sod is required to sign will so state, it's constitutional (I think).   Don't forget, even non-testimonial key surrender can be used to build a
body of evidence.  DISCLAIMER: I'm not a lawyer and the above is opinion only.

Which, of course, carries the implied threat of not reducing it to ten
counts and objecting to concurrency if he doesn't come across with the
keys. Not coercion?

This is not a critism, but with who do you plan on communicating using encryption? Absolutely no one I know uses it or is remotely
interested in it. I get the standard answer "I have nothing to hide".
Mentioning their bank p/w does tend to pull them up short. I do enjoy
the look on their faces.

@_subject: no passphrase request 
Running Debian Jessie with mutt 1.5.23 and gnupg 1.4.18-7 (yeah, I know
it's old, but then so am I)
Trying to send an test message to myself using mutts' compiled-in gpg
support. After selecting an action from the menu, (sign encrypt, etc) and
hitting return, I'm prompted for a key ID, never for a passphrase. The
message then refuses to send.
In checking for mutts' compiled options, I ran across this which may
have some bearing on what I'm seeing, or not. The options in question
are: +CRYPT_BACKEND_CLASSIC_PGP  +CRYPT_BACKEND_CLASSIC_SMIME
+CRYPT_BACKEND_GPGME. I'm assuming if it handles classic pgp it will also handle gnupg. Yes?
Searches and doc reading haven't turned up much of anything.
Any pointers on how to get out of this appreciated.
