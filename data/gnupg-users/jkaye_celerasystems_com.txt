@_subject: PGP Encryption Problem 
Hi all,
Newbie here, so please forgive me if this is common knowledge, but this
problem is somewhat pressing...
I have created a key with GnuPG.  I have exchanged keys and fingerprints
with someone using PGP 6.5.  I can encrypt files and send them, and they can
decrypt them.  But when they try to encrypt a file to send to me, they have
a problem with my key:
sig?           0x00000000             (Unknown signator, can't be checked)
This sounds like the key is unsigned, but I thought it was signed by default
with the --gen-key.  When I try to edit the key, it tells me:
"my key ID here" was already signed by key C4BB37C2
Nothing to sign with key C4BB37C2
In fact, when I create and send a new key, they try to import it and see the
Looking for new keys...

keyfile contains 1 new keys. Add these keys to keyring ''? (Y/n) Y
Keyfile contains:
   1 new key(s)
One or more of the new keys are not fully certified.
Do you want to certify any of these keys yourself (y/N)? y

Users cannot encrypt to this key.
Any thoughts/advice/instruction would be extremely welcome...

@_subject: Automated processes 
Hi all,
I'm new to GnuPG, and have been getting some help
from a kind soul.  I seem to have all the knowledge that I need with one single, but important, exception.
When I decrypt, it asks for my passphrase.  No problem
there except for the fact that I want to have an automated
script on a unix server perform the decryption of this file.
Of course, if it needs a passphrase, it's going to hang
and I can't have that.
I know that for PGP, there's an environment setting that
can be used to prevent this.  Is there a similar thing for
GnuPG, or do I have to jump through some hoops?   - Jack

@_subject: Corrupt file issue? 
Hello all,
I've had some success solving problems here before thanks to the kindness of many of you and thought I would give this another try.
We've got an intermittent issue (about once a week) where a daily
process that generates a text file, encrypts it and transfers it by
FTP will sometimes create a file that the recipient cannot decrypt.
If I run the process again, it will produce an encrypted file which is a few bytes smaller than the original file.  This new file can
be decrypted by the recipient without a problem.
Has anyone else encountered a similar issue?
Here's the command I use to perform the (signed) encryption:
gpg -r  -e Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
- Jack

@_subject: Basic file signing question 
Greetings all,
I have what is probably a very basic question but for some reason I
can't seem
to find the answer anywhere online and was hoping one of you GnuPG
boffins could assist here.
I am trying to digitally sign a file as I encrypt it.
The encryption part is easy:
gpg -r  -e Signing it is also easy:
gpg -r  -se But when I sign it this way, it just seems to take the first key in my
I have generated different public keys to send to different people and
would like to sign the encrypted file with a key of my choice.  Is that possible or
am I just not understanding the process of creating a digital signature?
Thanks in advance,
- Jack
