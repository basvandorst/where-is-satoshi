Will the new open protocol wave be supported (signing and encryption) by gnupg ?

Firstly, by "supported" I mean, if it becomes a standard communication
tool, could creation of key process be modified (name, email adress,
comment => name wave adress comment), because I understood that an
email adress cannot be a wave adress. Is there deep technical issus
there or just a matter of vocabulary ?
Adding a participant to a wavelate means to me that the wavelet has to
be reencrypted by adding C's public key ... but I'm not a tech expert
so It might be silly ...
