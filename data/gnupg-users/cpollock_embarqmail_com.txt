@_subject: [Possible SPAM] Re: UID changes (was Key Revocation) 
All, apologies for the late reply, but I've been fighting with my ISP/DSL provider about some changes they've made that are causing each mail I send to be tagged as [possible spam] via the new mail server, Synacor. Embarq's contract ran out with Earhlink and they decided to go with Synacor whom it seems has no clue about running Spamassassin. So, the best thing to do is when I get everything setup the way it should be is to revoke the cpollock at earthlink.net UID.

@_subject: problem installing gnupg-2.0.9 
I can't seem to get the above installed. I get the below at the end of configure, I've downloaded and attempted to install the below libraries but to no avail it seems. Looking at the file dates in /usr/lib they all seem to be the older version I've installed previously. Below is a link to the config logs for gnupg-2.0.9 and the three libraries. I had no problems installing gpg v1.4.9 except copying the binaries from /usr/local/bin to /usr/bin which for some reason my box likes instead of the default install directory. *** You need libgcrypt to build this program.
**  This library is for example available at
***   ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/
*** (at least version 1.2.2 using API 1 is required.)
*** You need libassuan with Pth support to build this program.
*** This library is for example available at
***   ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libassuan/
*** (at least version 1.0.4 (API 1) is required).
*** You need libksba to build this program.
*** This library is for example available at
***   ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libksba/

@_subject: Evolution locks up when sending large pgp signed file 
First of all I'm not sure if this is a sudden pgp problem or as is more
likely an Evolution issue. The just started after my upgrade a few weeks
ago to Mandriva 2010, Evolution 2.28.1 and Gnome 2.28. When trying to
send a signed message with a file over approximately 40k Evo will lockup
and have to be killed. Not signing the message allows any size file to
go through. This is version 1.4.10. I've asked on the Evolution list and
apparently have been ignored. Any suggestions would be welcome.

I've updated my Mandrake 10.1 box to 2009. On the 10.1 system gpg and gpg-agent were working smoothly.  I installed gnupg-2.0.9 from source and copied my old .conf files over to the .gnupg folder. I also installed kgpg.  When trying to add my key in Kmail to Identies > Cryptography >OpenPGP Signing key the "fetching keys" bar continues to scroll back and forth without fetching anything. My key is on the key servers. My key is entered in the OpenPGP encryption key block already.  I had this working correctly in 10.1 but it won't work now. I must be missing something. I have all the required libraries installed as well as pinentry-qt.  Any advice would be appreciated.

Starting as root worked so I then entered eval "$(gpg-agent --daemon)" and it now shows as a running process. Stopped and restarted Kmail, I did not get the warning that gpg-agent wasn't running this time which is good so I tried adding my signing key to the identies configuration. The 'fetchnig keys' scroll bar still just moves back and forth as if it can't find anything. I noticed that kgpg was running as 'chris' so I stopped the root gpg-agent and started as 'chris', I saw this:
[chris at localhost ~]$ eval "$(gpg-agent --daemon)"
can't connect to `/home/chris/.gnupg/log-socket': No such file or directory
gpg-agent shows to be running under processes though.
When running kmail as root and just setting up a quick identity when trying to fetch the keys there is no acitivty at all in the scrollbar

I only 'tried' it as root since you had entered  --daemon which on my box is the root login. I stopped the root process and started it as 'chris' where it is running now.
Again, I just did a quick check while gpg-agent was running as root to see if kmail started as root would pickup the key. Kmail and gpg-agent are running as 'chris' and neither are running as root.
[chris at localhost ~]$ killall gpg-agent

forth. Guess when time allows today I'll go in and read the docs on it,
I was just too tired last night to get very involved in it. I should
also be able to import your key to my keyring from one of the key

has simple solutions, it's just been so long since I had first installed
