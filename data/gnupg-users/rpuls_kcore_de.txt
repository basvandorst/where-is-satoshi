@_subject: Signing keys on a low-entropy system 
On Fri, 08 Nov 2013 00:11:38 +0100 Johannes Zarl The Raspberry Pi has a hardware RNG that is supported by rng-tools,
which is more than most desktop PCs have:
Not sure about its quality though...

@_subject: Length for AES256 symmetric encryption passphrase? 
I use this formula for my own random passwords:
L = Log(2^N) / Log(E)
L is the suggested length of the password
N is the key size in bits
E is the number of possible characters
For a mixed-case alphanumeric password, E is 62 (2*26 letters plus 10
digits). To create a random password equivalent in strength to a
128-bit key, you need Log(2^128) / Log(62) or about 22 characters. For
a 256-bit key, you need about 43 characters.
If you use a passphrase system like Diceware, take the number of
different words in the word list (7776 for standard Diceware) as E, and
the resulting L as the number of words in your passphrase. So using the
formula above, you need Log(2^128) / Log(7776) or about 10 words for a
128-bit key and about 20 words for a 256-bit key.
Of course, the way you generate, distribute, store, enter and verify
your passwords is probably far more important, so consider this formula
more like an upper bound on useful password lengths. :-)

@_subject: Decrypting PGP/MIME on the command line 
is there a command line utility that takes a PGP/MIME encrypted message
(a plain RFC 2822 text file) and outputs an unencrypted copy? The
secret key is available and GnuPG is configured correctly. It is okay
if the process is somewhat lossy; signatures or attachments do not need
to be preserved, although I would not mind that either. :-)
Background: I would like to decrypt e-mails permanently for archiving
and searching, and run this utility over hundreds of e-mails in a
single batch.
Alternatively, if there is a way to permanently decrypt an e-mail in
Claws Mail, that would help me as well. It seems that Enigmail has such
a feature[1] (or will have it soon), but I have not found anything
similar for Claws Mail and would prefer a general-purpose utility which
I can just run as a filter, independent of my e-mail client.

@_subject: Decrypting PGP/MIME on the command line 
Python seems to be the best solution for me, at least I have some
experience with the language.
Thank you, also to Werner and Doug, for the suggestions.
I will post here if I manage to come up with something useful. :-)

@_subject: Decrypting PGP/MIME on the command line 
Here is my first attempt (Python 3.4 and GPGME bindings required):
Needless to say, this is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL ? use at your own risk,
and keep backups of your e-mails! However, any feedback, patches or
pull requests are appreciated.
Current limitations:
- Tested against PGP/MIME encrypted messages created by Claws Mail only
- Does not handle inline PGP encrypted messages at all
More details are in the README.
To my surprise, it does seem to preserve signatures, but only if they
are not part of the encrypted message itself, but rather a separate
attachment inside the message.
It also does some strange things with the MIME structure: the resulting
message is a multipart/mixed with a single sub-part. My Claws Mail will
display this like any other message, but I have not tested it with other
mail clients yet.
Again, feedback is welcome, and please make backups. :-)

@_subject: Defaults 
I remember reading about an attack that works better against AES-256
than AES-128:
I am not qualified to argue for or against either cipher, but I wonder
if this advice from 2009 is still valid today.
