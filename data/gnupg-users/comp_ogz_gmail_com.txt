@_subject: differenece between gpg -s and gpg -se 
I was trying to see a binary file which is signed as below:
gpg -s -r "some user" file
gpg --verify file, verifies the file. But signing also compressed the
file so to recover to the orginal binary file i need to use --decrypt. So what is the differenece between gpg -se and gpg -s? -s parameter is
also encyrping, right?  The outputs of these two files are differenet,
I was planning to sign and verify the binary, because verification
happens faster than decryption. So how can i sign a binary and again
verify it without creating a detached sign?
