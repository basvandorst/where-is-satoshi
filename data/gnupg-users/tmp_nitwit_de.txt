@_subject: Resetting expiration of subkey 
My key was initially set to expire after 1 year. That year has passed now and I want to remove the expiration at all. I did so via gpg --edit-key but the ElGamal subkey kept its expiration date and I cannot encrypt data using this key no more.
How can I alter the expiration of the subkey?
