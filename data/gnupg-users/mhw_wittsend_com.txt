says "may add".  That's interesting in that we now have a dilema.  If
the GPL prohibits any and all patented technology, then this passage
is simply gibberish.  You could never HAVE any such qualifying software,
if the very thing itself was prohibited.  If it is NOT truely prohibited,
as section 8 implies, then the original copyright holder is only obligated
under a "may" and not even a "should" much less a "must".  To use IETF
delineations of nominclature, "must" implies something that is required,
while "should" is something recommended and "may" is something permitted.
So section 8 of the GPL as it is included with GnuPG states that if a
program (implied to be under the GPL or why would we be discussing this)
is restricted by patents (implying that GPL software might be restricted
by patents) then the author is permitted (may) to add a restriction on
with each other.  How can you even have section 8 if an allegation
of patent infringement means that you must refrain entirely from
distribution.  Looks like we have an RMS paradox here.
section 8 would be superfluous.  If section 8 is NOT superfluous, then
patents are permitted in GPL software (even patents without universally
free access as described elsewhere) and if the authors of the GPL had
meant to REQUIRE an author to restrict distribution, they would have
used other verbage in section 8.  Section 8 exists and is worded "may".
this can not be distributed because it contains the Idea algorithm and
that algorithm is patented, there is something else in GnuPG which is

Hyperlinking technology in general but they are also suing Prodigy
for infringing on that patent in the US.  With any decent luck (and a
clueful judge) this will be thrown out for the rediculous non-sense that
it is.  ITMT, however, GnuPG contains hyperlinks in its README files and
in the various html files and even in a few .c sources.  Till it is thrown

@_subject: gpg --pgp2 and sign+encrypt 
proceedure at  once you correct for
the typos in the FAQ (like --detach-sign instead of --detach-signature).
So, now I can build this into a shell script to automate the process.
(I have a very specific requirement for messages which are signed and
symetrically encrypted that must be read by pgp-2.6.2 users).  Is there
some reason this can't be incorporated into a super pgp2 compat mode?
