@_subject: Implementaton of GNUPG 
I would like to implement GNUPG on the office environment.
After searching on the WEB i found abt GNUPG which is free and performs
better than PGP (i think)
I have the following setup other app server -> (gnupg) -> our app server
Is there anyone can point to me the documentation or  is there anyone has
the similar setup ?
Thanks For the attention on this Email.
