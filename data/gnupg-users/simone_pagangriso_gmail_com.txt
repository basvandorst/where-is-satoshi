@_subject: gpgme fails encrypting on 64bit debian 
I'm facing a problem which is giving me a bit of troubles to trace with
gpgme. I've reproduced it with a simple test program (starting from another
simple example I found) which I paste below. This works on a 32-bit
debian-based system but fails on 64-bit one. In particular in the 64-bit
case I can successfully read and decrypt (not shown in the example) but I
get a rather cryptic error in the encryption:
$ ./test2 C37DBF71 Ciao!
Protocol name: OpenPGP
file=/usr/bin/gpg, home=(null)
Error in encrypting data. Error 1: General error (Unspecified source)
The version of libgpgme is shown above as well. GnuPG version 1.4.11
This is the output of uname, just to show you I'm running on 64 bit system:
$ uname -a
Linux spagan-laptop 3.2.0-39-generic  SMP Thu Feb 28 00:28:53 UTC
2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Yes, the first thing I've done was to extensively trying to make sure I was
defining _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64; also I checked that off_t has effectively
size of 8. This is how I compile it:
gcc -m64 -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -g test2.c -lgpgme
-L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -lgpg-error -o test2
and finally below there's the test program I used.
Thanks a lot for any help you could give me! I haven't found anything much
useful around yet to help me debug this.. (including a rough search in this
mailing list archives).
Please let me know if you need additional info!

Dear Werner,
 thanks for your answer and help (and sorry my late reply!).
I've changed the test program according to your suggestions.
In particular, to answer your question, the gpgme-config --libs --cflags
gives me:
-lgpgme -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -lgpg-error
I've also left the default engine info and got the same error. Then I
turned on the debug as you suggested.
I attach the output I've got. I went through it trying to get any clue on
the what is causing the error but got a bit lost: the impression I have
from the debug info is that the encryption is successful but then there's
an error right after(?). Thanks for your help, it's really appreciated!
 Cheers,

Thanks a lot Werner!
This was really helpful, not only for the (stupid) error I had but also on
how I can debug further problems on my own!
 Cheers,
