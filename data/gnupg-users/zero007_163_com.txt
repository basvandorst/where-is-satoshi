You said "8 can handle them", But I use PGP8.02 cant not verify you
signatures .It reports "*** Status:   Signing Algorithm Not Supported"
I use pgpdump shows that your signatures is "Ver 4 - new".
Can not PGP8.02 verify your signatures? If can ,how can I do?
By the way ,of course I can verify you signatures with GnuPG 1.2.3.
