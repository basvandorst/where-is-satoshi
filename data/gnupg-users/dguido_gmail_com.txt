- Use Andreas Maier's SUNrand to emulate /dev/[u]random
- Use EGD
Despite the great amount of work put into EGD I'd much rather have a

Ah, even more explanatory is this page:
Without forgetting my more specific questions in the last e-mail, what
does it take for Solaris to move from the "Other OSs" category to the
"Supported Systems" category?
