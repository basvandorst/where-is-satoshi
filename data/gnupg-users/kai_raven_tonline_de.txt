@_subject: effects and incompatibilities between GPG1.0.6 and PGP CKT 06 
i have made some tests with GnuPG 1.0.6 and PGP CKT build 06.
It seems to me, that GnuPG doesn't use RSA v.4 Keys with RSA v.4 Subkeys
correctly (?) and that there is a compatibility problem between PGP CKT and
GPG, based on the MDC function in conjunction with Twofish and AES.
I have summarized my results with the key material on the temporary webpage

Hello Werner,
Am Samstag, 7. Juli 2001 [15:15] hast Du geschrieben:
Attention: It is the PGP CKT version from Imad R. Faiad, not the NAI PGP.
For NAI PGP 7.0.4, all messages, signed and encrypted with GnuPG, could be
decrypted and verified with PGP 7.0.4, except signing with Testkey2, a RSA
v.4 key with RSA v.4 subkey.
I have added a short table at the end of my page, showing the summarized
results for GPG-NAI PGP 7.0.4.
I made the tests especially with CKT, because i don't like the
closed-source-policy from NAI and the missing security fixes for older or
newer version of PGP 7.

@_subject: tag in a RSA v.4 subkey 
Hash: RIPEMD160
this posting is related to the problems with PGP CKT/GPG.
In one of my postings i have said, that GPG uses everytime the masterkey
with a CKT generated RSA v.4 masterkey/RSA v.4 subkey.
Is a false subkey format/false tag the reason, why GPG uses not the subkey
for encryption?
I dumped the Test2/RSA v.4 master & singning key and the Test3/RSA v.4
master & ElGamal(DH) key with PGPdump:
Test2 key - RSA v.4 subkey:
Old: Public Subkey Packet(tag 14)(139 bytes)
        Ver 4 - new
        Public key creation time - Fri Jul  6 21:00:01 UTC 2001
        Pub alg - RSA Encrypt or Sign(pub 1)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        RSA n(1024 bits) - ...
        RSA e(5 bits) - ...
Test3 key - ElGamal(DH) subkey:
Old: Public Subkey Packet(tag 14)(269 bytes)
        Ver 4 - new
        Public key creation time - Fri Jul  6 21:00:01 UTC 2001
        Pub alg - ElGamal Encrypt-Only(pub 16)
        ElGamal p(1024 bits) - ...
        ElGamal g(2 bits) - ...
        ElGamal y(1023 bits) - ...
Shouldn't be the RSA v.4 subkey of key Test2 a
Pub alg - RSA Encrypt-Only (pub2)?
And complies a RSA v.4 subkey RFC2440?

Hallo Len,
Mmm, *imo* there's plenty of security reasons for not using NAI PGP.
- No source code available
- Additional Decryption Keys
- Designated Revoker functioned not properly
- no security fixes against Klima-Rosa for 5-7 and ASCII Armor Parser,
Klima-Rosa for 5-6
- the cooperation of NAI with NSA (SeL), U.S. Navy, DARPA
But now, imo it is time to close this thread,
because we are on gnupg-users.

Hello Michael,
I don't know something about the WG thing, i only think, it would be better
for a programmer (Imad or any other person, who is involved in PGP
programming) to participate in any form (eg the mailinglist).
But i know, he is aware of the problems and as i know him, he will do
something against the problems in a positive way for the compatibilty
between CKT-PGP-GPG.
And this is imo important, because more and more people will be changing
from PGP to GnuPG or CKT - take a look PGP NG's.

perhaps a fresh prompt and type
gpg --help and gpg --version first? ;-)
in the console window, you must give GnuPG some arguments, options, e.
g. to encrypt or sign a file.
gpg -ato file.asc -er key-ID file.ext
gpg -asto file.asc file.ext
but you can use also plug-ins or shells to handle GnuPG from the
systray and with your e-mail program.

@_subject: GnuPG RSA Keytypen (german) 
Hallo,
weil das Ganze etwas lang zum übersetzen ist, diesmal in deutsch -
sorry ;)
 weil mein alter RSA Key, den ich mal mit einer CKT PGP Version erstellt
 hatte (ich glaube es war build 06), folgende merkwürdigen Keyflags
 ausweist, habe ich mit GnuPG einen neuen RSA-Key erstellt
  alter Key (mit CKT PGP build 06 erstellt und nach GnuPG importiert):
  Old: Public Key Packet(tag 6)(399 bytes)
  	Pub alg - RSA Encrypt or Sign(pub 1)
  	Hashed Sub: key flags(sub 27)(1 bytes)
  		Flag - This key may be used to certify other keys
  		Flag - This key may be used to sign data
  		Flag - This key may be used to encrypt communications
  		Flag - This key may be used to encrypt storage
  Old: Public Subkey Packet(tag 14)(399 bytes)
  	Pub alg - RSA Encrypt or Sign(pub 1)
 Der neue RSA-Key mit GnuPG erstellt:
  Old: Public Key Packet(tag 6)(399 bytes)
  	Pub alg - RSA Encrypt or Sign(pub 1)
  	Hashed Sub: key flags(sub 27)(1 bytes)
  		Flag - This key may be used to certify other keys
  		Flag - This key may be used to sign data
  Old: Public Subkey Packet(tag 14)(399 bytes)
  	Pub alg - RSA Encrypt or Sign(pub 1)
  	Hashed Sub: key flags(sub 27)(1 bytes)
  		Flag - This key may be used to encrypt communications
  		Flag - This key may be used to encrypt storage
  wie man sieht, fehlt dem RSA Subkey des alten Key die Key
  Flags, die ihn als *nur zum verschlüsseln" ausweisen, während der
  RSA-E-o-S  *alle* Keyflags hat. Der neue Key trennt die
  Keyflags sauber auf den Pub- und Subkey auf, auch wenn imo
  fälschlicherweise beide RSA-E-o-S Keys sind, denn schaut man sich den
  Standardkeytyp ElGamal/DSA an:
  Old: Public Key Packet(tag 6)(418 bytes)
  	Pub alg - DSA Digital Signature Standard(pub 17)
  Old: Public Subkey Packet(tag 14)(269 bytes)
  	Pub alg - ElGamal Encrypt-Only(pub 16)
  findet hier von vorneherein eine klare Trennung statt.
 Ein GnuPG RSA Keypaar müsste doch dann aus einer Kombi aus
 RSA-S und RSA-E bestehen und nicht aus zwei RSA-E-o-S Keys,  auch wenn wohl die Keyflags sicherstellen, dass zum Signieren nur der  Pub- und zum Verschlüsseln nur der Subkey genommen wird, wenn ich das
 richtig sehe.
 GnuPG fragt ja auch nicht bei gpg --gen-key  (5) RSA (signieren oder verschlüsseln)
 sondern
 (5) RSA (nur signieren/beglaubigen)
 und bietet bei addkey neben (5) auch
 (6) RSA (nur verschlüsseln) an.
 Warum wirft dann also gpg --version überhaupt RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S aus,
 wenn Pub- und Subkey eh RSA Keys sind, deren Funktion nur durch die
 Keyflags unterschieden werden?? Dann sollte man doch das RSA-S und
 RSA-E entfernen, oder?

@_subject: GnuPG 1.1.91,GPGME and Sylpheed 
i have compiled the new GnuPG version.
First two questions:
I haven't found the new export command to strip certain attribute
packets like photo id's.
I was unable to use IDEA as extension, with 1.1.90 no problems
Without IDEA i cannot use --pgp2
Sylpheed told me, that GnuPG is not installed and deactivated
GnuPG functions, so i thought, that GPGME could be the problem - again,
with GnuPG 1.1.90 it was no problem to use Sylpheed with GPGME 0.3.8.
A new compilation of GPGME doesn't solve the problem. So i switched back to GnuPG 1.1.90.

@_subject: GPG 1.0.7 problems 
i'm using gpg 1.0.7 R2 from nullify under W2K, because teh regular
1.0.7. is still not available for Windows.
I have tried to create a subkey for a RSA key.
After the command gpg --edit-key ... addkey, gpg told me
gpg: out of secure memory while allocating 4320 bytes
gpg: (this may be caused by too many secret keys used simultaneously
or due to excessive large key sizes)
Too many secret keys simultanous? I have used only one key during the
edit command and have two other keys in my pubring.
Excessive large keys? The RSA masterkey is 3100-bit long and the
subkey i want to create is also 3100-bit long.
Out of secure memory?
What is the meaning of the messages and what can i do to add a subkey
What are the arguments for the gpg --pref and --showpref command?
C:\>gpg --pref
gpg: Missing argument for option "--pref"
Can i influence the used ciphers during key creation process with
gpg --setpref `string' or after i have created a key?

@_subject: cannot get sylpheed to do encryption 
Hello Newton,
without an error message about GnuPG? Than it works :)
Is "GnuPG" in the about dialog?
No, decrypting/verifying does sylpheed automatically for PGP/MIME
messages, for PGP-Inline messages you can add a user defined action
*gpg --no-tty --command-fd 0 --passphrase-fd 0 --decrypt %f|
under settings/actions and an icon for the toolbar, read the docs in the
source for more examples.
You can find the more general GnuPG settings in the settings/general
settings/private menu and for signing/encryption in the
'private' tab of the account settings (which key, ascii armored etc.)
You sign and/or encrypt in the message window over the 'message' menu
Read the FAQ (help menu>FAQ) and the docs (see above), they are very
useful for the daily work with sylpheed :)
No ;o)
