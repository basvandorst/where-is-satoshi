@_subject: GnuPG neophyte inquiries. 
Hi and welcome :-)
There should be no security problems.  Only you will know your passphrase, but if you let anybody have access to your passphrases, then they will be able to decrypt messages on your box.  I take it that you use different (passworded) accounts and therefore you would not normally gain access to the data of your roommate, and he/she not your data. To keep things extra secure, however, I would keep your keyring separate and download it into your machine before use and delete the keyring on ending your session.
Depending upon the email program you use, this should be done automatically.  I would suggest you use Thunderbird as your email program with the Enigmail extension to handle GnuPG, but you may wish to stick with another.  Just make sure it supports the OpenPGP People are trying all the time to find chinks in GnuPG's armour in order that the security and stability of the program is maintained.  They do occasionally find chinks and as these are reported to the GnuPG developers a new version is very quickly out.  It all depends on the security risk, but I have never had to generate new keys for this purpose in the six years I've been using GnuPG.  There is an OpenPGP standard to which GnuPG adheres, so there shouldn't be any reason why your keyring, private keys, etc can't be used with a new version of As I am (although a VERY mature student!).  There is no problem with security (other than general problems with Windows security) in using a flash drive.  It all depends if you are using a machine that will recognise your flash drive.  What I do under Linux is carry my keyring on an SD/MMC card and connect a card reader to the USB port of the machine.  It is then recognised as a mass storage device.  I point the email program to GnuPG and my keyring at its location.  I'm not sure how I would do it under WinXP, but you might like to look up WinPT, a front end for GnuPG on Windows.

The official Enigmail list can be joined at But there is also an unofficial Thunderbird forum which you can join at This yahoogroup was set up by Nick Andriash, who also set up the PGP-Basics yahoogroup, so it could be of use.  But these are both UNOFFICIAL yahoogroups

@_subject: Problems Deleting Key and Adding Key to Keyring 
I have Gpg 1.4.2 installed by default on my Mepis system.  When I tried to delete a key from my keyring both from the command line and through Kgpg I got this error:
gpg --delete-keys 0xCB1AA7B0
pub  1024D/CB1AA7B0 2003-11-18 Robert Blayzor (INOC) Delete this key from the keyring? (y/N) y
gpg: /home/graham/.gnupg/pubring.gpg: copy to `/home/graham/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.tmp' failed: file read error
gpg: deleting keyblock failed: file read error
gpg: 0xCB1AA7B0: delete key failed: file read error
When I tried to import a key I got a similar file read error.
I tried renaming my .gnupg file as .gnupg_old, rerunning gpg --help so a new .gnupg file would be set up and copying my keyrings, gpg.conf file, and gpg.trust file.  Still no luck.
I've checked permissions and they seem OK with all access except by owner being forbidden.  I've tried adding a .gnupg/pubring/pubring.gpg.temp folder and file without success.
Anybody know what I should do to get this to work?

============================== START ==============================
I don't know why it did it, but solved the problem by naming  pubring.gpg and secring.gpg with a suffix "old" (eg pubring.gpg.old), then doing an import on each file.  It asked me for my passphrase on each of my (old) keypairs but imported them fine.  I can now import and export keys to my hearts content!
As I said, I don't know what was wrong with the old keyrings, but its the simple things we tend to overlook....
HTH anyone with the same problem!

Just a thought.  Have you installed build-essential?
Ubuntu doesn't install many tools to compile from source code with the base install, so you have to do that yourself.  You might trying to change your sources.list to the dapper repositories, and then doing:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
Which will upgrade your distro to Ubuntu 6.06 and then other tools will be available to you.  The version I believe that is in the dapper repositories is gnupg 1.4.2, which may be sufficient for your needs.
But if you want to compile from scratch you will still have to install This is one of the reasons I am using MEPIS 6.0.  It uses the dapper repositories but it installs much more easily and has facilities to compile source from the base install.  Its default desktop is KDE, but you can easily change that if you're a Gnome user

@_subject: [lists] re:  Signing vs. encrypting was: Cipher v public key 
AFAIK this is the latest PGP command line version available - except
for server based systems, which is why the cost is *astronomical*.
When Network Associates sold the rights to PGP to PGP Corporation, they
kept the rights to the command line version, and unless things have
changed this is why PGP Corporation don't offer it.
But why bother when there is GPG?

I get the following message using Claws-Mail:
Key 0x33ACF71B not available to verify this signature.
Do you have it on a keyserver or webpage that I could get if from?
