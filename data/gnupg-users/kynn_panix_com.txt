@_subject: how to verify downloaded file 
I've downloaded and installed gnupg for the sole purpose of verifying
the integrity of a downloaded file.  My OS is Windows2000.
First I did:
  C:\My Download Files>gpg --import pgp_asc.htm
  gpg: c:/gnupg\trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
  gpg: key 74C732D1: public key "Michal Trojnara " impor
  ted
  gpg: Total number processed: 1
  gpg:               imported: 1
This looked OK.  Then:
  C:\My Download Files>gpg --verify stunnel-4.04.exe
  gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
  gpg: the signature could not be verified.
  Please remember that the signature file (.sig or .asc)
  should be the first file given on the command line.
Then I tried following the advice given in the error message:
  C:\My Download Files>gpg --verify pgp_asc.htm stunnel-4.04.exe
  gpg: verify signatures failed: unexpected data
What must I do to verify the downloaded file?

@_subject: Script with sensitive info 
I want to write a Perl script whose operation requires it to have some
sensitive information (bank account passwords, etc.).  This script is
meant to run non-interactively, so having it prompt the user for this
information is not an option.  Also, encrypting the file itself would
render the script uninterpretable by /usr/bin/perl.
Is there a way to use Gnupg to solve the problem of protecting this
script?  (I realize that the script is already protected by my Unix
account password, but I would like more protection than that.)

   You *can* require that a human input that key when the script
   starts up (maybe once per system boot). This still requires the key
   stay in memory in the clear (better than disk, but still possible
   to access).
I like this idea.  So let me ask a simpler question (I'm a complete
PGP/Gnupg novice): is there a good way to use Gnupg from within a Perl
script to encrypt and decrypt a text string based on a user-supplied
Many thanks,

@_subject: Disabling paging/swapping without being root? 
On Linux, at least, one can disable paging/swapping (to keep
privileged data off the disk) by calling mlockall(2), but only within
a root process.
Does Gnupg disable paging/swapping, and if so, can it do it when it is
run by a regular (non-root) user?  If the answer to the second
question is yes, how does Gnupg do it without using mlockall?
