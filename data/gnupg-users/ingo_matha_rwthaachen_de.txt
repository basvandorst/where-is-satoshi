Hash: SHA1
In my original posting I forgot to tell you that I use GnuPG on Linux.
gpg --verify --textmode <*the attached file in my original posting*
gives the following output:
gpg: Signature made Mon 04 Dez 2000 21:54:06 MET using DSA key ID gpg: BAD signature from "Michael Haeckel The same command line without '--textmode' gives the same output.
So the '--textmode' option doesn't seem to be the solution.
After some research I found out how the message with the good/bad
signature was composed.
Because of a bug (or a feature) PGP 5.0i isn't able to clearsign a
message if this message contains 8-bit characters (like german
umlauts). Therefore the developers of KMail programmed a work around.
The message is first signed with a detached signature and then a
clearsigned message is composed as follows:
"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n\n" + unsigned_message + "\n" + Now the question is:
Why do PGP 5.0i (under Linux), PGP 6.5.8 (under Linux and Windows) and
(according to Graham) even GnuPG 1.0.4 (under Windows) accept this
message as correctly signed while GnuPG 1.0.4 (under Linux) doesn't
accept the signature?
There seems to be some weird discrepancy between the Windows and the
Linux version of GnuPG.

The detached_signature was generated via 'pgps -batf', where 't' is textmode and 'a' ASCII armor. So it should be generated in textmode. But as you already said PGP 5.0i is really buggy. If a mail (or something else) you want to sign contains 8-bit characters PGP 5.0i always generates a type 0x00 signature (a signature of a binary document). Therefore GnuPG can't handle it correctly (and it doesn't have to).
I don't use it. The problem is that there are other people who use it. I just want to check their signatures. But this seems to be not possible. I'll try to convince these people to switch to GnuPG (or PGP

Have a look at the mailing list archives (lists.gnupg.org).
IIRC importing the key with PGP, reexporting it and importing it with GnuPG sometimes helps.

Hash: SHA1
if I run 'gpg --list-keys' it lists all keys in latin-1 which is the standard charset on my machine.
If I run it with 'gpg --list-keys --charset XYZ' where XYZ is iso-8859-1 or iso-8859-2 or koi8-r it lists the keys in the given But how can I list the keys in UTF-8?
'gpg --list-keys --charset utf-8' doesn't work (but would be the most reasonable possibility) and I found no hint in the manual, the FAQ or the mailing list archive.
BTW, I need this to import the user IDs correctly into kmail.

Except that colons, ':', in the user ID are printed as "\x3a". Why? Sure, the colon is the separator but the user ID is the last entry. So everything between the 9th colon and the colon at the end of the line is the user ID.
Which other characters are not printed in UTF8? How is the backslash

O.K.. I already found this out while reading the DETAILS.
I just had a look at print_string() in miscutil.c. The following special characters are escaped:
And the delimiter is escaped as \xXX, where XX is the delimiters hex The problem is that the backslash '\' is not escaped as '\\'. This can lead to ambiguities. Also \t should be escaped.
Or you could escape all characters between \x00 and \x1f and additionally the delimiter and the backslash as \xXX. This way you still have it done the C-way, there are no ambiguities and it is very easy to parse.
Moreover all programs which use such strings as input and which already interpret \x3a correctly as character with hex code 0x3a should still work with the new escaping method.

BTW, Werner, there are very often people who don't find the info to the mailing lists because they just don't look under Documentation (which I can perfectly understand because it's IMHO not very intuitive).

Hash: SHA1
Did you maybe forget to re-install GnuPG?
If not, have you tried encrypting a file on the command line or just from within KMail? If you have only tried the latter please check if encryption works on the command line. If it doesn't work there should be at least some helpful error messages.
