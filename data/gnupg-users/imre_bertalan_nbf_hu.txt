@_subject: Problem with default-cache-ttl 
Hello out there,
I have an issue with GnuPG and Thunderbirds enigmail. The encrypting and
decrypting works fine, the problem is that the Thunderbird asks for the
PGP Passphrase every time when an encrypted email arrives. I've tried to
set it up inside Thunderbird (not worked) and with gpg-agent.exe with
the default-cache-ttl option. (didn't work either) I would like to ask
what other method is there to set the system to remember the passphrase
for example 2 hours.
Thank you in advance!
Best Regards:
Imre Bertalan
