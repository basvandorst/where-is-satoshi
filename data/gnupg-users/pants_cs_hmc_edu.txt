You can add or delete the names and emails associated with a key using
gpg --edit-key and the adduid and deluid commands, respectively.

If you're against publishing your public key on a key server, why are
you signing messages with your private key and sending them to a public
mailing list?  No one receiving the messages will be able to make use of
the signature in the slightest.
On a more general note, the article you've linked has some social
critiques of reliance on keysigning, but has no real commentary on the
danger of public key cryptography.  Isn't the point of public key
cryptography to allow one piece of a key to be read by any party while
keeping the problem of recovering the encrypted data intractable?  If
you are restricting heavily the people you share your public key with,
why not simply use a symmetric algorithm, forgetting public key
cryptography completely?  It would certainly render the problem of
recovering any encrypted communication far less tractable.

I mean, by having access to a public key turns the technological attack
on encrypted data from an intractable one to an intractable one.  You
might now have a problem that goes with some smaller number raised to
the n, but that grows exponentially with n nonetheless.
Yes, it is fortunate that I, and indeed most of the cryptographic
community, will likely never face any sort of physical coercion.  I, for
one, am more concerned with privacy than with any serious data
sensitivity.  But the addition of a frail human element into the problem
is certainly interesting.  If one can torture a passphrase or key out of
someone, what is to stop them from extracting the encrypted data from
the person as well?  After all, in the situations you hint at, it is
this which is actually relevant to the torturing party.
