@_subject: ksba_cms_set_enc_val failed: Invalid S-expression 
I want to encrypt files with an X.509 public key DSA 1024 bits. With public
test keays it works fine. But when I try it with the one I need to use in
production the following error occures:
ksba_cms_set_enc_val failed: Invalid S-expression
I'm totally puzzled. I'm no encryption expert either. I user gpgsm -e -r
certname file.pdf >file.pdf.encrypt.
version is gnupg for windows 2.1.0.
Can somebody help?
