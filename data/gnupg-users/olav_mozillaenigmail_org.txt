@_subject: Two SmartCards simultanously? 
Hash: SHA1
Dear List,
I intend to share one computer with a person I trust. We both have an
OpenPGP SmartCard. My question is whether it is (or will be) possible
to install card readers / cards in such a way that we both can sign
and decrypt using our respectible card *without* having to change cards
in the one reader recognized first.

Hash: RIPEMD160
Hi list,
I spent a lot of time trying to find out how to set up a second SmartCard from
the default card backup (public key, secret key stub, off-card sk_enc) in order
to be able to read my old messages again - since the first card was broken one
day: it would no longer decrypt (hardware error).
- - two OpenPGP SmartCards (V 1.1 !), one main card, one empty card to replace
  the (now broken) one
- - Key generated on-card on CARD_A using GnuPG 1.4.9 (on Windows XP), with
  off-card backup during creation -> file "sk_ENCKEY-KEYID.asc" (ASCII-armored)
- - Backup of public and secret key from the keyring after generation
  -> files "KEYID_pub.gpg" and "KEYID_sec.gpg"
- - meanwhile I use GnuPG 2.0.12 (on Windows 7)
What I did:
- - kill gpg-agent (and scdaemon)
- - move Homedir "\gnupg" aside
- - gpg --dearmor sk_ENCKEY-KEYID.asc > sk_enc.gpg
- - gpg --import KEYID_pub.gpg KEYID_sec.gpg
- - insert CARD_B
- - gpg --edit-key KEYID
  toggle
  bkuptocard sk_enc.gpg
  PIN (to decrypt sk_enc)
  Admin-PIN (to write to the card)
  q
  y (to save)
Result: the encryption key is correctly written to the card but the keyring
doesn't refer to the new CARD_B but to CARD_a still.
I found telling to delete the secret key and reimport it through the --card-edit
Yet this didn't work: it just didn't create a new secret key (since the main
key still refers to the old card I assume). I could also not just delete a
secret subkey since after "toggle" and "key 2" the delkey command asked me
to "toggle" (back to pubkeys) prior to being issued - I also tried to delete
the whole subkey (which worked), reimported the pubkey (with "fetch" in

Hash: RIPEMD160
Hi Burcu,
you tried to derive the key "strength" from the number of lines of the (ASCII
armored) public key. It does not work like that. The secret of a 2048 bit key
is 2048 bit, that would be approx. [1] 5.5 "lines" you counted.
However, the public key also contains user identities (aka Email addresses),
signatures and other information described in detail in [2]. You may examine
your PUBLIC key packets by pasting them into a pgpdump [3] converter [4].

@_subject: same key pair for more than one e-mail address 
Hash: RIPEMD160
Hi Marcio,
it depends.
Using it for two private mail addresses that both are public is no problem.
You may add or revoke UIDs later on.
If you use an email address only your closest friends know, then adding a UID
for it to your public key would reveal it.
Also, keep in mind that if you use the same key for private and business,
depending of the legislation on your country, your employer might ask you to
hand out the private encryption key once you leave the company. It is wise
to avoid such situations by using separate keys for business and private use.
There are more cases like a low-trust key just to secure transport e.g. for
XMPP aka Jabber.

Hash: RIPEMD160
Hi Mistey,
cross-posting to the Enigmail users list since I expect your issue to be
more related to Engimail-GnuPG interaction than to GnuPG itself.
If you don't already have, I suggest you install
Thunderbird 3.1.2  Enigmail 1.1.2     GnuPG 2.0.14       This combination is known to work on Windows 7 64bit (though all are 32-bit
applications). Instead of GnuPG 2 you may also use
GnuPG 1.4.10b      If Enigmail complains about not finding GnuPG, this can have two causes I
know of: you installed GPG4Win to a non-standard place or you installed
1.4 from gnupg.org - this installer doesn't add the installation path to
the Windows PATH environment variable. You may solve both issues by adding
the proper path to PATH or enter the path in the Enigmail settings.
If your problem persists, please provide us with more detailled information
about what is installed where, which messages you get when and what the built
in debugging features tell you (JS console, OpenPGP console/logfile/debug).

Hi Stefan,
GPG4Win 2.0.1 / GnuPG 2.0.12 does support the OpenPGP card v2. In fact,

Hash: RIPEMD160
Hi Stefan,
No, I don't know what's causing it. But before examining further, I recommend
to follow these steps to avoid any user settings to influence the test:
Backup and/or move your GnuPG settings aside (homedir: keyrings, gpg.conf etc.)
Uninstall all GnuPG and GPG4Win versions and wipe what's left in the program
  directory. Make *sure* you only have one gpg.exe on your system. Check by
  searching your system drive / PATH.
Install GPG4Win
Reset your card* to factory presets
Retry using CLI to create a card key using defaults and an empty keyring
If that doesn't succeed, try to provide a more detailled error description (-v).
* How to reset a OpenPGP Card v2:
1. Create a FILE with this content:

GnuPG uses ~/.gnupg as homedir. It should be sufficient to move the content

Yes, inline/cleartext signed messages may just be forwarded as they are
