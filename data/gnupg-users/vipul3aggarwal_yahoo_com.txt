@_subject: compiling without gnutls-extra 
We are using gnutls 1.6.3. I was wondering, if we can compile the gnutls without the gnutls-extra.
This is required because the gnutls-extra is under GPL and we want to remove the GPL component completely from the gnutls package.
And then we want to ship gnutls without gnutls-extra along with our product.
So, what I want to know is that is there a way to compile the gnutls without the gnutls-extra?
Thanks n Regds,

@_subject: GPL components in libgcrypt 1.4.1 
I am using libgrcypt
for the first time.
I have some
question regarding the GPL components in libgcrypt 1.4.1.
?The helper programs (gcryptrnd and getrandom) as well as
the documentation are distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License (GPL)?
But, it seems following files are also under GPL.
I was also unable to make/compile the libgcrypt
without these 4 files.
Can anyone guide as to whether these files come
under GPL or not?
Thanks for the answers in advance.
