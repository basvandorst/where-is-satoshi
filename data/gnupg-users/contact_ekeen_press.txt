@_subject: How to use a the same generated keypair on enigmail/thunderbird and 
Dear community,
I am very passionate about cyber security and working against mass
surveillance. I therefore try to stay informed about security
measurements and encryption.
Nevertheless, I do have a problem which I cannot solve by myself.
I generated a keypair using enigmail on thunderbird for this email address.
Now, I'd like to use the same address with the same encryption keys on
an iOS device.
However, I don't know how to transfer the private key securely without
anyone else being able to obtain it.
Someone informed me that there might be a possibility to type in the
private key manually.
I 'd appreciate any help or further information you might give me.
Thank you very much.
Kind Regards,
