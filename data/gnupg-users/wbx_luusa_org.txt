Is it possible to use RSA keys for message encryption in GnuPG?
Recently I've discussed about this on a german mailinglist and I
think someone could use RSA keys only for signing with GnuPG. Right?
PGP 7.x seems to do both. RFC2440 says:
In a key that has a main key and subkeys, the primary key MUST be a
key capable of signing. The subkeys may be keys of any other
type. There may be other constructions of V4 keys, too. For example,
there may be a single-key RSA key in V4 format, a DSA primary key with
an RSA encryption key, or RSA primary key with an Elgamal subkey,
Are there any plans to integrate this feature?
It's not on the TODO list from CVS. best regards
