Hash: SHA1
There are two options that have to be passed to GPG in order for it to
create PGP5 readable signatures (at least from my experience).

You don't have it both ways :)  You can't be guaranteed what software your
recipient is using; therefore, you have to decide one way or the other;
be safe and use algo 1, which has worse performance, or take a risk the
person won't be able to verify the signature correctly, and use compress
algorithm 2.

GnuPG 1.0.1 does not display any useful information when --no-tty is used
in conjunction with --import.  It would be nice if it still wrote stuff to
the logger filehandle.

@_subject: 1.0.1 --with-colons does not list expiration for subkeys 
This seems strange, but GnuPG 1.0.1 does not seem to list the expiration
date for subkeys when the '--with-colons' argument is used.  The
expiration date is shown, however, if I list my secret keys instead of the
public keys.
Public key listing:
isr4033 ~> gpg --homedir test --with-colons --list-keys 53AE596EF950DA9C
pub:u:1024:17:53AE596EF950DA9C:2000-02-06:2002-02-05:59:f:GnuPG test key
(for testing purposes only):
uid:u::::::::Foo Bar (1):
isr4033 ~>
Note that the 'sub' record shows an creation date, but not an expiration
date.  Now see:
Secret key listing:
isr4033 ~> gpg --homedir test --with-colons --list-secret 53AE596EF950DA9C
sec:u:1024:17:53AE596EF950DA9C:2000-02-06:2002-02-05:::GnuPG test key (for
testing purposes only):
uid:u::::::::Foo Bar (1):
isr4033 ~>
Note that this time the expiration date in the 'ssb' record is shown.
BTW, should I be posting bugs like this to the -users or -devel list?  Or
some other list?

@_subject: making key listings faster 
Hash: SHA1
Disclaimer: I am not familiar with how GnuPG gets its information for
listing keys.
I will use the term 'validity' in this mesage to refer to the calculated
trust of a key, so it will not be confused with 'ownertrust' (On a side
note, I think NAI got it right with the term 'validity', instead of
If I want the normally-gathered information from '--with-colons', this
procedure can be _very_ slow.
This problem will be a serious one for me in particular, as in my program
pgpenvelope, I wish to present users with, say, those keys looked up by
'ftobin EXCEPT those which are disabled or revoked.  This seems
like a simple request, but doing so requires me to use '--with-colons'
(without '--fast-list-mode') to find out which keys are revoked or
disabled.  This can require a HUGE performance hit.
This behaviour shows itself most when the key being listed has many
signatures, leading way to me believing that this slowness may be caused
by GnuPG trying to calculate the validity of the key
I would further venture those operations other than calculating the
validity of a key have little overhead compared to calculating the
validity, as calculating the validity would be the only one requiring real
processing (the fields filled in just being lookups).
Hence, I would further venture that the speed --fast-list gets is from its
not calculating of the validity of a key, not from the absence of the
other things left out, such as UIDs or ownertrust, or
Proposed Solution:
Therefore, I am inclined to think that --fast-list should have its
behaviour changed to only leave out calculation of the validity of a key.
This will allow people to get information of a key such as UID's,
ownertrust, and revoked-disabledness without getting the extremely high
performance hit of not using this option with --with-colons.
