@_subject: Question about details of key sigining 
Signing documents means that the data is hashed, and then the hash is encrypted with private key of signer. (According to Handbook)
Is this the same case when signing not a file, but someones key? When you sign someones keys, does it mean that their public key (with uids) is hashed and the hash is encrypted, or maybe there is no hashing and signing means only encryption of the public keys and uids? Could you point me to specific portions of documentation that cover this Thanks for help.
