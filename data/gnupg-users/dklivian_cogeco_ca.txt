@_subject: Long time PGP / GNUPG user.. new to this list.. need 1.2.2 setup 
I've been using pgp since command line 2.6.2 (or there abouts.)  I have also been using gnupg 1.0.6-2 sucessfully for some time.  I'm running on a Windoze 2000 system.
I tried the w32 client for 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 and I can't get either to work... it keeps wanting to go to:
"c:/gnupg/a:\rings\" (or something very similar) where a:\rings is where I keep my keys.  I deleted all registry entries relating to GNUPG and still have this error.  I'm using an options file in the c:\gnupg\ directory to set the path to the keys.
To enable gpg from any command prompt I start with the following line:
path =%path%;c:\gnupg
What am I doing wrong?
I tried going to  earlier today, and the site came up just fine.. then I tried it later this evening (July 22nd 10 pm EST) and the site does not respond.  Clearly it's either down or under a denial of service attack.
P.S. Does mailing to this list automatically sign me up to it?  If not please reply directly as I'm not sure how to be able to read your responses.  My very sincere apologies for appearing like such a newbie.   I pride myself on computer skills, and this is humbling. :-/
