@_subject: International characters 
I've looked at the FAQ and on this list, but am still a bit confused
about this whole thing. I'm useing gnupg 1.0.6-1 on RedHat Linux 7.1
Is there any way to get international, Swedish in my case, characters to
display properly instead of getting those question marks, in the
comments from gnupg? Please CC me as I'm not on the list.

@_subject: problem decrypting 
I and a friend are both rather new to this and are having some problems.
He is using PGP 8.0.3 on Win XP and I have GnuPG 1.2.3 on Linux.
Neither have a problem signing, I can also send encrypted mails between
my different accounts and decrypt them without problems. I have imported
my friend's key and it shows up with gpg --list-keys with one pub and
one sub key. But as soon as I try to decrypt anything from him I get the
message that the secret key isn't available. Any idea what we are doing
