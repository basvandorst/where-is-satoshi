@_subject: How to get delsig to .. delete a sig? :-) 
Summary: How do you "select at least one user ID" when issuing a delsig
         command at the --edit-key prompt?
I have read the archives and saw a similar thread about the apparent
impossiblity of removing signatures that sneak onto keys once that
key has been sent to a keyserver. Okay.  Granted.
I want only to remove a signature that I generated with a secondary
key that I'm trying to purge *before* I export the primary key.
How do I delete the the ..A411 key (this example has been obfuscated to
protect the unqualified):
[GnuPG 1.0.6 on Linux - Same on Solaris ...]
pub  1024D/ffffD742  created: 2001-03-22 expires: never      trust: -/f
sub  1024g/ffffFFDD  created: 2001-03-22 expires: never     (1). Floyd Command> check
uid  Floyd sig!       FFFFD742 2001-03-22   [self-signature]
sig!       FFFFA411 2001-07-31   Barry  delsig Barry
You must select at least one user ID.
Command> delsig 0xffffa411

Thanks for that.  For the record (to include some list-archine search bait):
$ gpg --edit-key key_you_want_to_edit
# For keys with multiple UIDs, hit the number of the UID that has the
# sig you want to strip.
# GnuPG will prompt you if you want to delete each of the sigs one at
# a time.  Hit
# for each on you want to keep, and
# for the one you want to remove.
Thanks again, Lionel.
(And the for the mis-addressing heads-up - I hate the way this mail client
 works.  Mutt wouldn't have become confused).
