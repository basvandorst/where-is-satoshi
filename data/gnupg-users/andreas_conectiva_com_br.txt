@_subject: Can't check pgp-6.5.8 signatura 
Hash: SHA1
I'm unable to check this signature against this file (both URLs
below). Before making a big noise about this I just wanted to
check with other gnupg users if this isn't just an interoperability
problem with gnupg and pgp (the signature was made with pgp-6.5.8):
$ gpg -v --verify telnetd_122_patch.txt{.asc,}
gpg: Warning: using insecure memory!
gpg: armor header: Version: PGP 6.5.8
gpg: Signature made Mon Jul 30 22:56:15 2001 BRT using RSA key ID F376813D
gpg: BAD signature from "Tom Yu "
I downloaded the key from here:
Gnupg version I'm using:

*My* message wasn't, I recently switched back to old-style because
too many were complaining about receiving my message "as an attachment".
But what about my question on those URLs...? Or wheren't you able to
read the message at all?

Looks to me that you did NOT verify the signature... :)
Maybe I wasn't clear... GnuPG is reading it and checking it indeed, I
just wanted to confirm that the BAD signature is really, well, BAD, and
not just some interoperability problem between PGP and GnuPG.

Ops, sorry, you are right, you verified it with PGP and pasted the output
of GPG.
It does. It seems I'll have to install this specific PGP version in order to verify
the security patches from the Kerberos team since that particular keyholder
didn't reply to my emails.
Thanks for everyone who replied.

Could someone please post a short list on how to enable/disable all
these many signature types in mutt?

Just for completeness, I downloaded pgp 6.5.8, installed it and could
then verify the signature with success (and it verified). I now removed
pgp :)
If anyone can come up with a solution for GPG to be able to verify that I
would be very glad to hear about it.
Thanks for all the help.

What exactly is the keyserver subdirectory for in the gnupg
tarball? The only reference I could find was in the NEWS file,
something about "plugins" for some keyservers.

Ah, I see now, gpg would call them depending on the type of
keyserver being used via --keyserver, for example.
Nothing like reading the manpage. Just that I was trying to find
a manpage for gpgkeys_ldap and didn't think about checking gpg's
