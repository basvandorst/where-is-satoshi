Are you in touch with Enigmail developers? Or should I post your question on Enigmail list?
And thanks for jumping in - there is no further response to my original question at Enigmail forum (besides recommendation to talk to GnuPG developers). Sent by GoodLink (

That's just a regular signature.  How does Enigmail call GPG to do the

I confirm. On a different problem caused by the same PGP :-).
Even with --allow-multiple-messages, cleartext-signed PGP/MIME messages
produced by PGP Universal server still are not verifiable.
Thank you!

@_subject: GPG signature verification problem? 
I've tried to verify signature of the email that arrived from gnupg
mailing list (sent by Ryan).
Verification fails, with the following error message. I'm using
GPG-v.1.4.7, and Thunderbird/Enigmail.
Could somebody with a clue explain me what's wrong, and whether it's a
problem with my config (and if so - what I should look at), or whether
it's a bug in GPG?

Hash: SHA512
Going off the top of my head, the DLP is known to be greater than or  equal to the difficulty of the IFP.  You can make strong arguments  that they're equal difficulty in a computational-theoretic sense, and  you can make strong arguments that in real silicon DLP will be  stronger due to our current lack of understanding of how to  efficiently use the general number field sieve for the DLP.  The  current state of the art in the GNFS requires a large amount of  storage overhead for the DLP, while the storage overhead for the IFP  is comparatively minimal.
As a word of warning, comparing DLP to IFP is a spectacularly black  art.  There are so many nuances to it that just expressing some of  the ideas in English is difficult.
As further warning: it's 9:10am, I haven't yet had my morning cup of  coffee, and I'm working without my references.  This being the  internet, there's also a nonzero chance that I'm barking mad.   Confirm this information before relying on it.

That's a convincing proof.
Not that I can see... Every line except for the very last one is full, and seems to have no weird
characters (nor blanks) in it...  On the other hand
in your signature encoding, before the last short
line the supposedly-long line appears truncated.
Here's Robert's sig again:

Interestingly, with GPGol both signatures verified correctly!
While attempts to use GPG4Win directly (open the email piece and
run GPG4Win on the Current Window) fail with "BAD signature".
And GPG4Win crashes at the attempt to retrieve a key from the
remote keyserver (from behind HTTP proxy).
Thank you!

The signature text is displayed in lines of 64 ASCII characters. Blank

The last line of a signature is composed of five ASCII characters.
The line before that last one can have less than 64 ASCII characters.
Could you verify my signature?
Seems fine.

Yes it worked!  :-)
Specifically I ran WinPT - the part of it which allows
Decrypting/verifying contents of the current window.
Thank you!

I've imported the key manually, and the result is still the same (Bad
signature). GPGol has no problem verifying signature over that same
message in the same Outlook window.
I've set the appropriate fields for HTTP proxy, including user name and
password. WinPT still crashes on attempt to contact remote keyserver
when I ask it to search for a key.
Yes, both are reasonable things to do - but they don't apply to this one
particular case.

@_subject: libgcrypt: Length of IV 
IV should be equal in length to the block size of the cipher
(not the key size). Yes IV can be of a different length - but unless you fully understand the implications, I advise against it.

Since SHA224 is part of the NIST standard, and TIGER isn't - I question
this decision and hope that GPG-2 team will reconsider.

Confirmed.  1.4.7 and 2.0.3 (both from source) are also on my system.
$ (gpg --version; gpg2 --version) | grep 'Hash:'
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA224
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160, TIGER192, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512
In other words:
1.4.7 supports SHA224 but not TIGER192.
2.0.3 supports TIGER192 but not SHA224.
I myself was curious why SHA224 was inexplicably dropped.  Not that I
assume many people use it, but it seems a bit arbitrary.  Is there an
explanation, wk?

@_subject: Problem interoperating with PGP Univeral? 
I am trying to get cleartext-signed PGP/MIME messages produced by PGP
Universal 2.5.3, verified by email clients (Thunderbird-1.5.0.10 +
Enigmail-0.94.2 + GPG-1.4.7).
So far my experience is:
- Pure plaintext (neither PGP/MIME nor PGP/Partitioned) messages are
verified OK.
- PGP/MIME encrypted and signed messages are decrypted and verified OK.
- PGP/MIME or PGP/Partitioned messages (HTML body and/or attachments)
fail signature verification, with error message from GPG:
  Cleartext signature without data
I've submitted help request to Enigmail list, but perhaps somebody here
can advise me regarding this issue? Maybe there are settings at PGP
Universal that should be changed to make its output "friendlier"? Or
maybe there are GPG setting that would allow verification of those
emails? I'll be grateful for any help!
Thank you!
