Because what you are signing is the association
between some public key and some user ID. If the
signature is put on another key with the same user ID,
it will be invalid.

@_subject: gpg --list-keys lists keys twice 
Hi GnuPG users,
Please excuse me if this has already been covered here -- I was unable
to find anything about this problem in the mailing list's archives.
When I use 'gpg --list-keys KEYID', any matching key is output twice, as in:
$ gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring .gnupg/pubring.gpg --list-keys 134012DD
pub  1024R/134012DD 1994-12-23 Thomas Quinot uid                            Thomas Quinot uid                            Thomas Quinot uid                            Thomas.Quinot
uid                            Thawte Freemail Member uid                            Thomas Quinot pub  1024R/134012DD 1994-12-23 Thomas Quinot uid                            Thomas Quinot uid                            Thomas Quinot uid                            Thomas.Quinot
uid                            Thawte Freemail Member uid                            Thomas Quinot As far as I was able to test it, the problem occurs with any keyid
in the keyring. If I run 'gpg --list-keys' without a keyid indication
on the command line, keys are listed only once.
This is GnuPG 1.0.6 under FreeBSD 4.3-STABLE.
Any help is appreciated.

OK, problem resolved. :)
I had erroneously listed the GnuPG default keyring, ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg,
in ~/.gnupg/options.
I believed that --no-default-keyring would mean 'no keyring listed
in ~/.gnupg/options'; it seems to me that it would make more sense
that way.
