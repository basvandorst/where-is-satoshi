@_subject: script to clean my keyring 
I like to clean my key ring automatically. I have put the attached lines together to do this. But something is wrong, the script shows the data which need to be changed but the update is not saved. Experts, what is wrong here??
for i in `gpg --list-keys --fixed-list-mode --with-colons |
grep "^pub" | cut -f5 -d":"` ; do
????????????????gpg --batch --yes --edit-key $i clean
And a general Question: I like to frequently run "gpg --refresh-key" and after this the above script, in case it works, to get rid of the overhead. Do you think this is a good idea to do so?
Thanks a lot

Hi John,
thank you for the answer how to clean my key ring:
=== 1 ===
This will make a clean import to the current pubring.gpg but will this
help? Will these keys which are imported overwrite the keys in the current
pubkey.gpg? Or would I need to start whith a "striped" which only contains
my selfsignature?
=== 2===
I like to keep my key ring updated, what about this: I run on a frequent
     # Assumption is that the key is currently clean
     cp pubring.gpg pubring.bak
     gpg --keyserver-options import-clean \
       --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.org refresh-keys
     cp pubring.gpg pubring.tmp
     gpg --import-options import-clean --import pubring.tmp
Thanks a lot

I have imported many keys which have lots of duplicated key as well as no
more valid uids.

@_subject: Problem with gpg and option --check-options 
I am useing kde 4.1.1 and gpg 2.0.9 within kde there is a Program Kleopatra
to maintain the keys. This program performs a selfcheck and complains about
an option setting:
gpgconf: ung?ltige Option "--check-options"
I have searched all files up and down but I can not find out where this
option is set. If there is anyone how has an idea to find this setting or
even has an idea why this option might be invalid - I'd be happy to here
Thanks  a lot

These are my settings in gpg.conf I do not really see a check-option, how ever this makes sense. Maybe one of the experts sees the problem ?

thanks for the hint, I have changed this - unfortunately this did not made a change to the error message.
Interesting to mention what Kleopatra tells me: - gpgcong Configuration Check Ok
- gpg Configuration Check failed
- gpg-agent Configuration Check failed
- scddeamon Configuration Check failed
- dirmngr Configuration Check failed
All failed have a tool tip which says: gpgconf: invalid option -check-options
I have searched google so many times. i do not find a hint - hope you have one Am Donnerstag 02 Oktober 2008 01:01:03 schrieb John Clizbe:

Hello Werner,

Thanks, my typo there are two dashes... I use for KDE: Version 4.1.2 (KDE 4.1.1 (KDE 4.1 >= 20080828)) "release 52.2"
so this is kind of very actual but not (too) experimental..
I will unsubscribe from the list and post an update in case I encounter problems. Is there an anouncelist for your next release?
