@_subject: gpg-agent caching with smartcard 
I can't seem to make gpg-agent cache smartcard PIN at all,
whether signing, decrypting or authenticating ssh.
All of those work fine otherwise, but I have to enter the PIN every time.
I did set "signature PIN" to "not forced" in the card.
I am using subkeys, which may or may not be relevant,
gpg version 1.4.2, gpg-agent 1.9.20
Searching I found only one reference to similar problem, with
no solution:
Is this a bug, or am I missing something?

Duh. It makes the card essentially unusable for the purpose I had
in mind (replacing ssh-agent with gpg-agent using the card). :-(
