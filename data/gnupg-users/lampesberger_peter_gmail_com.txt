@_subject: 2 keys with same passwords and email on keyserver(but only 1 
Im a gpg newbie...
And i did one bad thing: I generated my first key.... and uploaded  the public key to the keyserver.
then i decided to take a better keylength and deleted the old key on  my harddisk (and yeah i ignored the warning message.)
Of course, i didnt generate any revoke-cetifikates...
And now i generated the second key with the same password and email  but with another length and uploaded it again.
Now I have 2 public keys and only one private key....
But i tried to send an encrypted mail with my first public key....  And could decrypt it?!?! I deleted my old private key.. so why can i  decrypt it?
or i am stupid?
Can somebody help me?
sorry for my bad english!
