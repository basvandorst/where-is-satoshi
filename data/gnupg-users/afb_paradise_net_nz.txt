Hi, having seen a reverse example at I attempted
Tux:~# /usr/bin/gpg
gpg: Go ahead and type your message ...
gpg --armor --export mykey > mykey.asc
.. where it hung.
I had thought to move mykey.asc and myseckey.asc to
an appropriate WinXP location before doing
gpg --import mykey.asc myseckey.asc
in an XP window via 'cmd' having already done
What have I missed here ?

Hi, Having recently set up lenny on a new box, I copied
the contents of ~/.gnupg from the old etch box to a
USB stick and then to the lenny box - but find that
mutt does not do digital signatures as it did on the old one.
What am I missing here ?
T2: ~/.gnupg# ls
gpg.conf  pubring.gpg  pubring.gpg~  random_seed  secring.gpg  trustdb.gpg

Thanks. Following another msg from is list, I removed 'random_seed'
and tried sending a signed mutt mail.
All seemed well until the final stage when I received the following
error message...
