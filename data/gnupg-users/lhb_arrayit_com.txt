@_subject: Help! Gnupg can't run in php program 
Does anybody use GnuPG in PHP program?
The server is on Debian OP.
I create my key pair in the ./gnupg directory.
And the command "gpg --help" runs as normal.
But the command "gpg --list-keys" failed.
What's the problem?
My code is below:
echo "cmd: $cmd, return code: $val_return";
$cmd = "gpg --homedir ./gnupg --list-keys";
system($cmd, $val_return);
echo "";
echo "cmd: $cmd, return code: $val_return";

Thanks for you help.
I now get a solution from Try echo system("gpg --help"), then echo system("gpg --list-keys"). If help works but list keys does not, then you might try the 1. Set the following permissions
chmod 777 .gnupg chmod 666 trustdb.gpg chmod 604 secring.gpg chmod 604 random_seed chmod 644 pubring.gpg 2. use the --homedir setting with gpg
i.e. gpg --list-keys --
homedir /usr/local/home/root/.gnupg
