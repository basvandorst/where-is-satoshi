@_subject: gpg --card-status doesn't create key stubs 
I'm truing to make my hand-made OpenPGP smart card work.
Card status are looks good and I can move keys with keytocard command.
But I can't find a way to encrypt data by card-stored keys.
Public keys are imported and can be shown by `gpg -k`.
`gpg --card-status` shows that keys are on the card.
`gpg -K` show no private keys available.
Can someone give me an advice what step should I do next to make my card work?
I've posted full reproduction scenario. It can be found here
