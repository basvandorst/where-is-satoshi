I've got the following problem: I'm already using PGP 6.5.8 on Win and Linux and want to use GPG 1.0.4 with KMail on SuSE Linux 7.1 now. All the docs only describe how to generate new key-pairs and not how to import existing private/public pairs. Anybody out there who had done this before ?
Thanks for your help in advance.

hi brian,
first thank you for your tips.
I installed Geheimnis (on KDE 2) now, but I've got the same problem
I can encrypt something with my keys but when I try to decrypt anything,
I got
an error like "secret key not available". Maybe this is something that
has to
do with my keys ? I'm using a 3072/1024 bit DH/DSS key pair at the
moment. are
there any limitations in gpg ? When I try to import my keys I just see
1024 bit
as key length.
have a nice day

I don't know, as I said I'm using PGP 6.5.8 on Win and Linux, and I'm
able to use these keys with PGP 7.0.3 on Win ,too.
