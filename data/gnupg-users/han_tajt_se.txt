I've found a bug/malfunctionality in gpg.
if you specify the same output file as the inputfile you never get the
contents of the infile within the sigature.
This could be a potential point of insecurity if IF it's like this (I'm
just speculating here) You read the in file, make the crypto stuff, write
the outputfile, in this stages: write the PGP begin mess ,READ THE
write out the input to the output, and then the signature.
then an attacker has the time between the two reads to change the
inputfile , but the signature verify wil fail so ...
anyway if it's an unsupported way of signing (with the same input and
output) gpg chould say that, when you try it.
Evidence: (:-)
 gpg sign with different in and output files: [han han]$ gpg --no-batch --comment "Made with PGP4Pine"
