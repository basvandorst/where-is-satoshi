@_subject: keyserver choices out there? 
I am currently in the process of exploring setting up OpenPGP for my company's use. The execs are tired of the rumor mill knowing about things before they do. They need a way to encrypt/decrypt their email when using outlook. I have been playing with G-DATA GNUpg-plugin for outlook and everything seems to work well (anyone know if they plan on updating it?). I now need to figure out an easy way for everyone (hundreds of people) to exchange public keys.
I am looking for a keyserver that has the following features if possible: 1. Web based interface so users can upload/search/download keys. 2. Ability to create and offer for download an entire keyring..     Example: Search for all keys with the keyword "xpedite" in     the email and produce a keyring that folks can import directly     into GNU Privacy Assistant. 3. Easy or at least not too complicated method for admins to remove    keys from the keyserver. 4. If possible.. the ability to export a key directly from GNU privacy    assistant directly into the keyserver. 5. Free, and opensource if possible. Can you suggest what would be the best keyserver to use in your opinion? I want to set one up internally in my company. Thanks for any assistance you can offer..
