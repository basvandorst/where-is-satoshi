@_subject: GnuPG (GPG) Problem 
I have a problem. I have 2 computers and I set one up with GnuPG(GPG) with a key. I use Thunderbird to send and receive encrypted email with no problems. The second computer is not set with any key. I want to setup the second computer with with the "Same" email like the first computer with a key, but it doesn't work. When I start to generate my key, it fails. Here is what I I typed in my name, enter the "Same" email, basically everything is all the same. Once I entered my pass phrase, it starts generating the key. After a couple of minutes, I get the below error.
gpg: no writable public keyring found: eof
Key generation failed: eof
gpg: can't create `C:/GnuPG\random_seed': No such file or directory
My question is, is it possible to have 2 computers with the same email settings but with a different key, OR is there a possibibilty that I can use the same key for both computers? If yes, how would I set that up?
PS, Detailed instructions would be nice by the way.
Thank You.
