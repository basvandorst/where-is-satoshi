@_subject: Key Length Issue on Mac OS X 
I am facing key length issues when generating new keys with GPGTools.
All new keys, are quite short compared to what I was used to.
I can reproduce this issue consistently on both my MacPro on OS X 10.11.6 and my MacBook Pro on OS X 10.13.2 (tested on this machine with the last 3 Mac OS, El Capitan, Sierra and High Sierra, and different versions of GPGTools since mid 2016).
The issue remains the same with the last version of GPGTools, released December 22, 2017.
While generating a new key, I generally have a large file downloading, two others copying from/to the HD, typing text in TextEdit, and mouse pointer moving around.
As much as I used to obtain very decent key lengths, as much now, I systematically obtain a much shorter one, regardless the disk activity during the generation of the key(s). The key length is remains the same, without the disk activity mentioned above.
To illustrate, here is a link to an image with a previous key generated in March 2016 and another generated recently:
I have contacted GPGTools support where Luke Le advised I should post my issue here.
Any advice and help would be truly appreciated.
Thank you.
