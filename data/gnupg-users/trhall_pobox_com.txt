The PGP question is a bit off-topic, but here's a question for you.  What
version of PGP are you using?  Also, you may want to try to add the
following to your PGP command:
+force +batchmode
We have an automated system that encrypts/decrypts files, and those two
flags keep the system from outputting any additional messages or
prompting, which is probably why it's causing you problems.  PGP is
"noisy" by default.
Also, you aren't signing the output.  Don't you want -feast?
Here's what your modified line should look like:
pgp -feast +force +batchmode '$uid' |
        ^  ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^
We usually specify the +force and +batchmode at the end, but since you are
using it as a UNIX-style filter, I think it's probably okay.
Hope that helps.
