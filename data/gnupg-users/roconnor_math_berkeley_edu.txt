Hash: SHA1
[To: gnupg-users
Is it posslbe to move or copy a subkey from one key to another.
Specifically I want to take my expired encryption key to my new key so I
can decrypt my old messages with my new key's passphrase.  Then I can
forget my old passphrase.
I think I must have done this before, but I might have done this by
assembing my own open-pgp packet by hand.

1. Are there tools to take a subkey from one key and transfer it to be the
subkey of another key, or do I have to write my own?
2. Why is it that GnuPG will refuse to decrypt using a secret key if there
is no corresponding public key in one's public key ring?
Thanks for any info.
