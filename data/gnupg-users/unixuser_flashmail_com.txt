@_subject: Use gpg with sylpheed 0.6.2 
I tried Sylpheed (compiled and works on SuSE 7.1).
It works nicely, has many functions.  But the OpenPGP-MIME is not very=20=
practical to use.
If I sign and/or encrypt a message to Kmail, it comes out all garbled=20=
(I know, because kmail doesn't support PGP-MIME)...
Signatures are also embedded, and the message is unreadable on my=20
outlook client at work (it has no PGP support).
Can Sylpheed be made to support the inline signing/encrypting like=20
And can it be made to interpret such messages form other clients?

@_subject: PGP signature support broken in Evolution 
Hello all
I've been searching yesterday and I found out that PGP signature support in
evolution is mostly broken (there was verification about this in their bugtracking
system).  Apparently, signatures made are mostly invalid with other mailers, and the validation
of MIME and ASCII messages fails 95% of the time.
(while command line works fine).
Does anyone know if this will be fixed soon?  Ik like evolution, but it's extensive
PGP/GPG support was one of the main reasons I chose it...
Kind regards
