Hello everyone,
I was wondering how I could sign pdf-documents created with pdflatex?
Can I use OpenPGP in some way?
I have messed about with itext, but I end up with a 'form warning bar'
in the viewer - not really what I want :-D
Thanks Ulrik

Using gpg -b file.pdf results in a detached signature. However, only
internal signatures will do. The  idea is to sign applications and
having a detached signature (or a signature in general) just confuses
people who are not computer scientists.
Thanks for the quick response

keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -sigalg MD5withRSA -keystore testkeystore
- -alias mykey
I can add a signature to my pdfs, still using itext but without the
annoying 'form warning bar' (I am a tad confused)
Using the following code, I load the testkeystore - can I do something
similar with gpg?
            KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
            ks.load(new FileInputStream("testkeystore"),
