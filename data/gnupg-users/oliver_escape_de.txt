I created a test key and a revoke certificate with PGP 2.6.3in and gnupg
won't accept the revoke certificate if you import the test key first.
$ gpg --import revoke gpg: key 82895D81: revocation certificate added
gpg: key 82895D81: not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
GnuPG version is 1.0.2, OS is Linux.
I saw a similar problem with PGP6 in the list archive, but couldn't find
a solution there.

I did not import the secret key and I don't want to do that. But that's not
the point. What happens if you don't have the secret key? Example: Your mail partner sends you a revoke certificate for his key
because it is compromised. GnuPG ignores this revoke and you'll end up
using his key again and again.

I know you can work around it this way. But why not change gnupg so it
imports revoke certificates correctly? I really don't understand it's
current behaviour. Am I missing something here?
