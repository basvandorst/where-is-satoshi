@_subject: Secure Memory Warning Message? 
Hash: SHA1
I'm running the Win32 1.0.4-2 version of GnuPG, and I have added
"no-secmem-warning" to my Options file to try and suppress this message:
gpg: Please note that you don't have secure memory on this system
gpg: Signature made 04/16/01 10:27:34  using DSA key ID 7BA3FDCE
gpg: Good signature from "Nick Andriash "
gpg:                 aka "Nick Andriash "
gpg:                 aka "Nick Andriash "
The above entry was simply typed directly into my Options file in
C:\GnuPG, but the warning message remains. When I try to enter it through
DOS, this is what I get:
C:\GnuPG>gpg --no-secmem-warning
gpg: Please note that you don't have secure memory on this system
gpg: Go ahead and type your message ...
Have I not typed it in correctly? What does GPG mean by "Go ahead and type
your message"?

When I generate a new DSA/ElGamal Key Pair in GPG and import it into PGP,

That's great... thank you very much for taking the time to show me that.
BTW, where did you find that numbered list of Algorithms? One final
question has to do with AES-128, and that being why we don't have AES-256
available? I presume it's supported but just not included in the 1.0.4-1
binary? That would answer my question as to why PGP always shows AES-128
as the Algorithm used on Keys generated by GPG, regardless of whether I
list AES-256 as my preferred Algorithm. ;o)
If I was able to compile my own binary, would I be able to include AES-256
in my Preferences?

@_subject: Encrypted  Session Key is Bad? 
Hash: SHA1
When I use PGP to decrypt a message encrypted using GnuPG 1.0.4-2 by Keith
Ray (and GnuPGShell v1.71 as a front-end), I receive a PGP error message
stating that the "encrypted session key is bad". The recipients of those
encrypted messages who use PGP are also receiving the same error message.
The default Key I use is my 3072 bit DH/DSS ElGamal Key that I have been
using with PGP for the last couple of years and I have never experienced
this problem before. The only thing that has changed is that my Mail
Client (The Bat) now has GPG support through a Plugin.
Could the Plugin have some effect on how GPG encrypts the Session Key? I
thought once that process starts, nothing would interfere with it? We have
no problem decrypting those messages with GPG, aside from a reference to
an old style signature which I presume is from --force-V3-sigs:
gpg: encrypted with 3072-bit ELG-E key, ID E8634C4B, created 2000-10-11
      "Allie Martin "
gpg: no secret key for decryption available
gpg: old style (PGP 2.x) signature
gpg: Signature made 04/22/01 21:11:49  using DSA key ID 7BA3FDCE
gpg: Good signature from "Nick Andriash "
gpg:                 aka "Nick Andriash "
gpg:                 aka "Nick Andriash "
Do you think that perhaps the "Encrypted Session Key is bad" is caused by
the Plugin?

There are compatibility issues when importing GPG Keys into PGP: Something

I cannot be any more specific on this but I'm in the middle of researching
the topic as we speak.
Using PGP generated Keys with GnuPG does not seem to cause any problems

@_subject: Lines Beginning with "From" Dash-Escaped? 
Hash: SHA1
Strange, but I just noticed that both PGP and GPG insert a dash/space
(dash-escape) at the start of a line beginning with "From". I never
noticed that before, and although I do realize that some Mail Clients used
to use "From" as a delimiter, I never thought PGP/GPG would dash-escape
The dash/space is only applied if "From" starts a sentence, and the word
must be capitalised. "From" by itself is not affected. Below is an example
of what I mean:
- From here to eternity
from here to eternity
With both PGP and GPG involved, I thought this must be part of RFC 2440 so
I looked through it and found Section 7.1/Dash-Escaped Text. It hints at
PGP applying the dash-escape to "From" lines because some MUA change these
lines to ">From", so therefore GPG should follow. Although I've heard of
some MUA's that use "From" as a delimiter, I've never seen it used.
Can anyone expand on the reasons why PGP and GPG use the dash-escape in
this manner, aside from what is written in the RFC?
Thank you very much.

Have you entertained the idea of using a small USB device known as the

well hold Key Pairs/Rings as well.
The MUA I have (SecureBat!) encrypts all it's Files and Folders listed
under the Application, and uses the iKey technology to store all passwords
and passphrases right on the Token itself. Remove the Token, and the MUA
shuts off... replacing the Token brings the MUA right back up on screen
where you left off.
I know that NAI have mentioned partnering with Rainbow Technologies, so
GPG may well follow suit.

Hello Alexander,
Probably because he would be damned if he did and damned if he didn't. By
that I mean... The only decent GnuPG Windows Front-end is GnuPGShell, and
especially so with the recent release of v1.90. With it's upgraded
KeyServer support coupled with a new 'Current Window' menu, it truly
allows using GnuPG on Windows a joy indeed. There really is no comparison
between GnuPGShell and WinPT, as I have tried them both and WinPT,
although promising, is still in it's infancy.
A lot of new potential Windows/GnuPG Users will be turned off by the
immaturity of WinPT. So, Graham had to either suggest GnuPGShell with
GnuPG, or PGP, and in both cases was promptly dumped on. At times it is
difficult to determine if this List is about promoting GnuPG as it's name
suggests, or about promoting open source Software.

JW> Client's editors invoked by mailreaders should not do such things

I'm not sure if I explained myself properly. When you draft a message and
send it, it has to be wrapped, does it not? That wrapping in most cases
(TB!'s WYSIWYG Editor uses hard returns so there is no behind the scenes
editing) takes place *after* the message is sent, and again in most cases,
after it has also been signed. Result? Failed signatures.
JW> It's nut gnupg's responisbility to bypass the bugs of other editors or

No, but if GPG is going to sign the message before it's wrapped, then the
signature will fail because the text has been altered. GPG must then
account for that by somehow making sure nothing happens to the text once
it's been signed... which is where a feature like PGP's wrapping comes
into play.
JW> And besides that, the sender of a message can't know how the receiver

But how does he do that if the formatting of the message doesn't take

Hello Anthony E. Greene,
Why is it that *she* has several choices? Why doesn't the GnuPG Team do
something about it? Was not a condition of the funding provided by the
German Government that a Win32 version be developed? What are the *supported* OS's?

Hello Drew Byer, ABCSites, Inc.,
If you are trying to install GnuPG on a Windows System, you only need
the Zip File. However, a much better choice would be to download
basically the same thing following these instructions:
1) Windows Users should go to the following URL and download the
precompiled binary for Windows "gnupg-w32-1.0.6-nullify.zip":
2) Now download the latest version of GnuPGShell or WinPT, both acting
as Win32 Front-Ends for GnuPG, which is a commandline Program :
If you want a copy of our (PGP-Basics ML) latest "GnuPG Installation
Help File", let me know and I will send it to you.

Hello Kai Raven,
That's right, but the Nullify download already contains the IDEA module,
along with the SHA2 and TIGER Modules as well, and puts them all
together in their own sub folder. It is just an easier way to install
GPG for a new User.

Hello Justin R. Miller,
What then is the reason behind the 'warning'?

Hello disastry,
What was the purpose or strategy behind a non-self signed UID?

Hello Dale Harris,
No one was *demanding* anything. I was only responding to Tony's
remarks regarding the options left to a Lady that was wanting to run
GnuPG on a Win2K Machine:
Similar to your response that I should start writing code, it seems
absurd to suggest to new Users that they write their own code if they
are wanting to try GnuPG, but are running into OS specific problems. We
are not Programmers... we are Users wanting to try and use GnuPG, and I
would think you and the others would want to do everything possible to
see that effort become successful. You talk about *attitude* Dale? This kind of attitude... that Windows
Users be left to their own avail if they run into problems... seems to
be prevalent on this List, and most especially from Linux Users. GPG
will never become a replacement for PGP unless the GnuPG Development
Team exacts just as much effort on a Windows version as it does a Linux
I don't mean any disrespect to Werner and his Staff, but I have quite a
few Members of my PGP-Basics List that are teetering on trying GnuPG,
but responses like "write your own code" will most definitely turn them
away from GnuPG.

Hello disastry,
Oh, I see. Thank you very much for the explanation.

Hello Anthony,
Then please accept my apology, because that certainly was not my intent.
My thoughts were that if the GnuPG Development Team is wanting GnuPG to
be thought of as a replacement for PGP, then surely they are the ones
that should be responding to those who have OS specific problems,
instead of the end Users having to write their own code, or short of
that having someone else write it for them. My other question to you about which were the 'supported' OS's, was made
in earnest because the GnuPG Web Site specifically states Win 2K is one
of those supported OS's, so I just wanted to make sure we were talking
about the same thing.
Again, my apologies to all who took offense to my posting.

Hello Paul Davis,
I notice that you are using Outlook as your E-Mail Client, so I am
presuming you are using some version of Windows. If so, what Front-End
Program are you using with GPG? If, for instance you were using GPGShell,
you could simply open GPGKeys, highlight the Key(s) in question, then
right click and choose "Send to KeyServer". :o)

Hello Mark Brown,
No, and it wouldn't do any good anyways. Eudora's PGP/MIME does not
adhere to the RFC standard despite the claims from both NAI and Qualcomm.
With reference to Mutt, I don't really know of any popular Mail Clients
that can handle PGP signatures from Mutt Users.
