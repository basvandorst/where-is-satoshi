@_subject: Question about subkeys for a GnuPG generated RSA key 
Probably a simple question to answer: When I generated a Key pair for GnuPG, and selected RSA/RSA (Which I did because my front end said something about PGP, and I thought it a good idea to be compatible) 2 keys appear when other people try to encrypt mesages with my public key.
Why? And why does this not happen if I generate a key with DSA/ELG?
