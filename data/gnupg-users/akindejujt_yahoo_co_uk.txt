The script you posted ("gpgwindir -r 483DC811 -e ~/src -p hilton") ?instructed gpgwindir to encrypt directory ~/src?with key 483DC811 and at the same time to attempt a decrypt with a passphrase hilton.? The program would be confused and not do anything.
There are 2 streams of functions
encryption: the syntax is
gpgwindir [-o "path"] -r "key" -e "path"
or gpgwindir/d [-o "path"] -r "key" -e "path"?? if you want to delete unencrypted source file.
Note [-o "path"] is optional.? If not provided, gpgwindir will encrypt to the same directory as source.
decrypt: the syntax is
gpgwindir [-o "path"] -p "passphrase" -d "path"
Note [-o "path"] is optional.? If not provided, gpgwindir will decrypt to the same directory as encrypted source.
General note: Ensure that paths are quoted Ensure keys and passphrases are quoted?or properly escaped if they have the space character.
I will happy to help you further if there still any issues. How does this program work?
Here is what I tried:
gpgwindir -r 483DC811 -e ~/src -p hilton
Nothing happened ?? Where is the encrypted directory?
I also tried this:
gpgwindir -o ~/src-encrypt -r 483DC811 -e ~/src -p hilton
The syntax of the command is incorrect.
Invalid number of parameters
Strange things going on here!
