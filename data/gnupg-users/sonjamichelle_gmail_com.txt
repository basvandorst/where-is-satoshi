This can also be done using Task Scheduler for folks using a Windows PC.
In my particular instance using 64bit Windows 7 my gpg.exe was installed with GPG4Win and can be found in C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\pub\
I also put that path in my list system path variables as well to make command line gpg actions easier.
The task I set up runs weekly with the following command "C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\pub\gpg.exe --refresh-keys"
Note the use of quotes.
When this task runs a command window opens and you can see the output. You can add > null to the command to kill the window output if you prefer.

I filed this today at  but I
wanted to send it to the list to get wider discussion about the idea. If you do not regularly refresh your public keys from keyservers, you do not get
timely expiration updates or revocations, both of which are very important to
have available to your local keyring as soon as possible. If you do not refresh
your keys from the keyserver, and I have revoked my key because it has been
compromised, then you will continue to use my key without knowing that I've
revoked it. That can lead to bad situations. For proper functioning of a
distributed web of trust, this needs to happen, and until it does the breakages
in those links are too fragile and frequent.
I did an experiment recently where I set my key expiration to be short and then
one week before it was to expire, I extended the expiration and sent that to the
keyservers. What I found was that one week later, virtually everyone that I
communicate with using that key thought that my key had expired, because none of
them have a process to regularly refresh their keys in their keyring. I had to
contact them individually and explain the situation and then advise them to
setup a personal cronjob to do a regular refresh, typically I suggest something
0 1 * * * /usr/bin/gpg --refresh-keys > /dev/null 2>&1
This is annoying for every gnupg user to have to setup on their own. It is also
problematic for people who do not understand cron. In my experience, asking
every user to do this is problematic, as very few actually end up doing it. I've
been begging people to setup cronjobs like this for the last 2 years as I've
been going through various key transitions, and very few of them actually do it,
even those that I have urged 3-4 times to do so.
It also cannot be done in a reasonable way automatically by distro packagers due
to the fact that package maintainers cannot know how the local admin needs to
have things setup (such as a system-wide cronjob, or a adduser hook). For
example, home directories are not necessarily local to a machine, and having a
system-wide cronjob to scan all user's home directories and then modify them is
not a good idea; or they don't use adduser and instead use automated tools for
account creation. It seems like the best solution would be to build into gnupg the functionality
that is similar to the automatic trust database operation: have gpg auto-refresh
From the configured keyserver periodically. There are some considerations that
should be made here, such as how frequent should this refresh operation happen?
Should it happen on every use, before the key is used? Should it happen just on
the key(s) that the current operation is going to act on? What about network
problems, such as no network at all, keyserver down, or slow? There should
probably be a low timeout to not cause user annoyance, but also some sort of
indication/warning that when a keyserver update could not be performed that the
key is potentially out of date. Users should have the capability to configure in
their gpg.conf a 'no-auto-refresh-keys' variable if they do not want this
functionality. Perhaps even some sanity checking on the data that is coming in
would be good to guard against gigabytes of data coming down.

To handle this issue I added the "reply to list" button to Thunderbird.
Whenever I deal with a list, I hit that button. I added it through the
right click > customize menu and drug the button to my toolbar.

I use gmail for my SMTP needs. I have accounts on a couple of unix
machines, yahoo, gmail, aim, my business hosted via godaddy and I choose
gmail as the default SMTP server for all of them. Works like a charm.
Give them a try. Gmail is free and it can be a good account to pass to
sites that you feel may be spam generators. Gmail has web/pop/imap
access and has fairly decent spam filters.

Pffft, they can't get to the really important stuff past my tinfoil hat!
And google don't scare me! What I'm really worried about is the MiB.
That van across the street, he ain't no plumber!!
I could really use some coffee, but I forgot the combination. :-(
If couldn't tell by now, I'm being a sarcastic b---h. I get so tired of
the "tehy're out to get you" gabble people spout on the net.
EVERY internet provider (AND the zit faced kid next door) has the
ability to sniff your data and your packets. If I let that stop me from
using the internet I'd be living in a foil lined airstream up in the
hills pooping in a dirt hole and eating berries.
Got any hard data to back up this claim, or are you just basing your
oogie-boogie stay away on newsgroup, blog rumblings and sensationalized
ratings focus media hype? I'm sure google just has a dedicated team
rifling through the millions of gmail user's data looking for that ripe
piece of information.
I've been accused of having murderous intentions by a couple of
employers, doesn't mean I have a couple of bodies buried in the back woods.
It's like the facebook privacy fiasco. OMG!! FACEBOOK IS PUBLISHING MY
RANTS AND THOUGHTS!!! Well here's a nugget of common sense, if ya didn't
want anybody to know about it, then ya shouldn't have posted it to a
semi-public location in the first place!
ANYHOW, back on topic.

OMG!! Google is stealing and archiving pictures of my dopey cat doing
stupid stuff!!!
OH KNOW!! Google now knows I have a hair appointment on Thursday all
because I use google calendar.
What am I going to do!!!! My privacy has been invaded!!! I feel so
Seriously, if it's personal and you don't want to take the risk of
someone knowing about it, don't put it on the internet in the first place.
And if you have to put it on the net or transmit it to a friend, encrypt
it. I mean you ARE a GPG user, right?
As far as google running around with a Wifi enabled car snagging data
from unsecured access points, it's the end users own damn fault for
blindly buying an AP and just slapping it on their network.
I'm not that paranoid that I loose sleep over the possibility that
google may be archiving pictures of my cat, the occasional dirty joke
and a few "Hi Mom, we're doing great here, how are y'all?" emails. All
my important stuff is on my PC on an encrypted hdd behind a router using
two tiered encryption and a 25+ character passkey. And anything that is
REALLY personal and SECRET is stuffed in a case hidden in my home under
lock and key. And if it's damaging and detrimental to my character or
freedom, it's only exists in my own head as a memory.
I mean I've got better things to turn my attention to, like trying to
finalize the processing and paper work to get my $59 million Nigerian
nairas that my dead rich uncle (who I didn't realize I had) from the
International Bank of Abuja. Just gotta run to the bank tomorrow and get
that $2500 cashiers check for the processing and duty fees. Then I'll be
on easy street!!!

@_subject: GPG on Windows 7? 
Hash: SHA1
I've been using GPG4Win (current version I have is v2.0.14) on Windows 7
64bit for a year now with no issues from the OS.
Outlook 2007 was a different story though. None of the plugins out there
ran quite right without issues and crashing. I'm not a programmer so I
can't say if it was Outlook's fault or the plugin's fault. I switched to
Thunderbird with Enigmail about 8 months ago and have no issues with
email signing or encrypting.
As for the explorer shell, 64 bit does not allow encrypting from the
context menu. I encrypt/sign files from either the command line or
through Kleopatra or through GPA's file manager.

Kleopatra which installs with GPG4win supports "drag & drop" file operation.
I double click the icon in the systray, it brings up the Kleopatra
window, I then drag/drop the file I want to work with on to the window.
The appropriate dialog menu opens up upon mouse release.
