@_subject: Netscape plugin anyone? 
Hi, I know that providing dumb-user readyness is is not one of GNU's
main concerns, but it woul promote PGP quite greatly, if one could
hack a little Netscape-plugin to use GnuPG.  That way one could present
a real alternative to the free PKCS stuff that comes with Netscape.
I don't have any idea how to write Netscape plugins, but I wanted
to ask whether someone knows more about it, or is alreday working
on it?
