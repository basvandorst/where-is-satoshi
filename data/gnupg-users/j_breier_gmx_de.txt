@_subject: Which key type for offline signing key + how to get a trusted copy 
Hash: SHA1
I want to create a key only used for key signing (on an offline system with Knoppix). As I recently read that 1024bit DSA-keys are quite small for long time security (let's say 10 years) I wondered whether I should use a 4048bit RSA-key instead. Is there any reason not to do so?
The Knoppix version I use only comes with GPG 1.2.4 or similar. I would like to upgrade to GPG 1.4, but have no idea how to get a verified copy of the GPG signing key (57548DCD). How did you verify your first copy of this key?
Sorry for my english, and thanks for any replies.
Jakob Breier.

Just to be sure: PGP-*keys* are hashed before they are signed? I thought
they are signed in the same way as checksums are so that this key does not sign any checksums at all.

Sorry for the latency. An hour ago I realised that the reply function didn't work properly.
