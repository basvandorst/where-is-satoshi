At this point, the two specs exist and are driven in part by different philosophies regarding the trust model.  While technically speaking, either could support the other's trust model, it isn't particularly inviting to do so.  S/MIME inherits the X.509 convention of a hierarchical trust model - I trust your key because Verisign says it is your key and we all trust Verisign.  The OpenPGP Web of Trust works on a decentralized trust model, where trust in a key is based on one or more degrees of separation created by users signing each other's keys - You trust my key because you trust Bob's key, and he signed my key.  All of this is necessary to create comprehensive trust for the keys in use.
OpenPGP is by far the more popular standard among people actually using email encryption.  That said, there is a lot of room for improvement in OpenPGP integration with mailer software.  S/MIME has had some very clean mailer integration that should inspire new work on supporting

While we're on the topic, here are some of my comments on S/MIME, and what we can learn from it:
S/MIME mailer implementations have been riddled with interoperability problems and tentative (at best) support from their backers.  While I haven't given it a shot in a couple years, I understand that Netscape is not actively developing S/MIME support.  Outlook still seems to work, but I don't know of any other implementations.
I think there are a couple really important things to learn from the S/MIME mailer implementations we've seen:
1	Key Propogation
S/MIME mailers attach the cert to every outgoing message (that is signed or encrypted).  Not only that, they notice when a cert is attached to incoming messages and add it to the keyring (mixing metaphors a bit).
2	Opportunistic Encryption
Try sending a message to half a dozen recipients when you only have keys for half of them.  S/MIME mailers will encrypt tho those it can, and send cleartext to the rest.
3	Seamless Integration (My favorite!)
S/MIME mailers never show you any cyphertext.  They just have little icons to indicate when a message was encrypted or verified successfully.
None of those observations have anything to do with the protocol.  I think Open PGP integration needs to to take some of these hints.  However, the problem isn't that the mailer developers are doing it wrong, it is that they haven't been given the tool they need - an open source OpenPGP toolkit.  This is what the world needs now, and in my view, the best approach is to extend OpenSSL.  When that's done, it will be very practical for every mailer developer to build OpenPGP support directly into their apps.

Yes, most are.  Most mailers and users have taken the extreme convenience over security approach: no security at all.  I believe that using the OpenPGP standard provides a scaleable security model.  Users who require very high levels of security should be able to operate in a way that serves them.  Most users would benefit from some opportunistic use of email encryption.  It is this mode which has yet to be fully I don't agree.  Promiscuous key propagation encourages the use of crypto.  I don't trust keys simply because they are on my keyring.  I trust them for various other reasons, some of which can be cryptographically enforced within the OpenPGP standard (Web of Trust).
Bandwidth isn't something I waste much time trying to minimize these days.  At any rate, a lot of smart heuristics could be applied along this path, for instance, the mailer could stop sending keys to users whom it his received encrypted messages from.  Or, if we get our act together with keyservers, this could be dropped.
Again, this is implementation specific.  If the mailer wants to report which users it can encrypt to, great.  If not, this is a way to make sure we get at least some of them.
Great to hear.  If I ever learn to configure Mutt, I'll try it out!
Yes, libgpgme is a good start.
The point here isn't to get into a deep discussion of hypothetical implementation details.  If libgpgme or other libraries make it easier for mailer developers to integrate OpenPGP into their apps, then we can start to see some innovation in making crypto easier to use.  In the mean time, you will be forced to email your mom in the clear.

In some cases, you only have keys for some users and not for others.  If I'm sending a message to 6 people, and only have keys for 3, why should I be encouraged (or forced) to send it in the clear to all of them?
A known plaintext attack is far less of a threat than not using crypto at all.  In PGP, does a known plaintext attack put the private key at risk?  As far as I know, that's not the case.  All you can really prove is that a given message went to somebody.
I've heard great things about KMail and vow to check it out this week.   I'm looking forward to seeing how you guys have integrated OpenPGP.
Thanks for the info,

@_subject: FYI patent application 20010055396 
I believe David Jevans works for Valicert.
This patent application certainly has some disturbing claims.  Many of which should be easily disputed as PGP could stand for prior art.  Especially trying to claim the basics of using multiple keys, and then encroaching upon what sounds like threshold crypto or Blakely-Shamir "k of n" keysplitting.  Relaying keys off a server is hardly novel.  Being able to send additional decryption keys (coincidental acronym?) to the server might come off as seeming handy, but it is probably pointless.  Technically, I could do that now with S/MIME.
Also, the patent application seems a bit immature to me.  Why would you explicitly and separately claim that symmetric and asymmetric cyphers are covered?  Nobody uses asymmetric cyphers to encrypt messages, just keys.  They're too slow.  Maybe he thinks that will change.
Then again, if all this can be done in GPG, why don't we encrypt this Paul Holman

@_subject: Does apache have to run as the site owner? 
It might work to just leave your Apache setup the way it is and put a .gnupg directory with keyrings inside your htdocs directory.  You might want to extra-protect it with .htaccess rules as well since your keys would be in there.
Just a thought.  Also, I think you can override all the $HOME specific stuff with command line flags on GPG which would eliminate the dependency on user environment.
