@_subject: Strange signatures 
Content-Disposition: inline
I recently checked my key to see who'd signed it, and I found one of my user IDs and one subkey had the following line in them:
[unexpected signature class 0x00]
Now, is this anything to be worried about, and if so, what do I do about it?  Furthermore, why would a subkey have it?  I thought people only signed the master key and all of its user IDs.
