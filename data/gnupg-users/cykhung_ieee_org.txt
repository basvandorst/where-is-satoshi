@_subject: Can I wipe the original un-encrypted file in GPG? 
In PGP, after I encrypt a file using either symmetric
or public key encryption, I have an option to "wipe"
the original file. Using "wipe" is better than simply
deleting the file. Is there a "wipe" option in GPG?

@_subject: How do I do "wipe" in WinNT 
I am using GNUPG in WinNT at work (I know that this is
not the favorite OS for GNU people but I don't have a
choice) and I would like to have the "wipe" feature as
availabe in PGP or the shred command in Linux. Is
there any similar thing like shred in NT? Thanks.
