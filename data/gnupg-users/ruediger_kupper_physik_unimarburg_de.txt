Dear John,
I experience exactly the same problem, and I'm completely out of ideas, too.
The only way to make win-gpg-1.0.6 import (and use!) a linux-1.0.7 secret key is to generate a completely new keypair, using that "--simple-sk-checksum" option, which is classified to be a security risk in the GnuPG handbook.
And even besides that possible security risk, it does not really solve the problem of importing an already _existing_ linux-1.0.7 secret key generated without this option. And, of course, this is what I want.
After almost a week of testing, trial, error and frustration, I made up my mind that probably the best way to "solve" the issue is to wait until a win-gpg-1.0.7 binary becomes available... Hopfully this won't have the problems described above.
Nonetheless, if anyone has a solution, I would appreciate :-).
Best regards,
You display the wonderful traits of charm and courtesy.

Thank you David. That's the way to do it. (I could have sworn I had already tried this, but there you are... :-) )

@_subject: Unable to send key containing photogrtaphic ID 
Since I added a photographic ID to my public key, I am unable to send it to a key server (neither via 'gpg --send-keys' nor via a web interface.) I use 'wwwkeys.de.pgp.net' as my preferred keyserver, but also tried 'blackhole.pca.dfn.de' (which I think is the same server), and The web interfaces do reply "Error decoding keyblock".
Are keys containing photographic IDs in general not accepted by the key servers, or is there a problem with my specific key? (Please ask me to send my public key if this will help answering my question.)
Thank you for your help.

@_subject: LDAP support in gpg-1.0.7? 
My Linux gpg-1.0.7 is unable to access a keyserver via the LDAP protocol:
gpg --keyserver ldap://pgp.surfnet.nl:11370 --recv-key 0xC2303358
gpg: unable to execute program "gpgkeys_ldap": No such file or directory
gpg: no handler for keyserver scheme "ldap"
The binary "gpgkeys_ldap" does actually not exist, and was not built during the make process. There is, however, a source file named "keyserver/gpgkeys_ldap.c" but it does not seem to be processed. (Instead, there is a binary "gpgkeys_test", but I'm unsure what this deos.)
Is there any configure option to be set in order to make "gpgkeys_ldap"? The configure script reports:
checking whether the LDAP keyserver interface is requested... yes
but this seems a bit of a lie... :-)

@_subject: cannot send public key 
In case your public key does contain a photographic ID: I just learned that the HKP-Servers do not accept such keys. Use an LDAP server, such as ldap://pgp.surfnet.nl:11370.
