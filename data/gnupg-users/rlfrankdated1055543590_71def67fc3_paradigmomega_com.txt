@_subject: Is this even possible? 
I would like email to a certain address to be automatically encrypted bef=
it is stored on the hard drive.  I can set up an alias and have our MTA p=
it thru gpg or something that leads to gpg, but what would be needed  is =
way to encrypt without a passphrase (obviously decryption would require a=
passphrase), put a unique id on each email received and write the encrypt=
data to disk.  Obviously, it could not then be treated as email, but the=20
files could be decrypted and processed when needed.
Any ideas?
