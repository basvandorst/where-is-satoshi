signing the keys normally ?

Dear Users,
I have recently installed PGP-6.5.2 , on my windows machine.
It seems that this software (PGP-6.5.2 for win) knows GnuPG generated Public
Keys well but can not import  secret keys!
Please help me.

Thank you.
The secret key can now be imported successfully, but PGP does not recognize
the correct passphrase!

You mean MS-Windows is a winning software - I don't think so :-)

Do you know why PGP 6.5.x can not verify the messages that is signed by
GnuPG ?

Use PGPEnvelope instead. It works well with PINE and hopefully with Emacs.

I have mailcrypt installed on emacs 20.4 using gpg 1.0.1. Some of the
encrypted messages that I recieve aren't recognized as such by
cryptmail. I get the message 'No encryped message in buffer', yet
sending the encrypted contents to gpg decrypts them just fine. Anyone
have a clue as to why I am having this problem?
