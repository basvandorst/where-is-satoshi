@_subject: FTP Server 
Hi there,
I'm trying to setup a mirror of gcrypt folder at
ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/pub/gcrypt/gnupg/ so i can fully mirror gnupg.
Any idea of when the ftp server will be back up ?

Is there any command that will delete expired keys from a keyring ?
I have had a look through the docs but cant seem to find anything, so i
thought i would ask the guru's :)

Well thats a great bash script which i will incorperate into my *nix box
Basically what im trying to do is build a php frontend to gnupg which
can act like a keyserver. The keys are imported using --fast-import
which i belive doesnt touch the trustdb, so all im really trying to do
is basically delete all expired keys in the pubring (and possibly keys
that have been revoked).
I intend on using a bash script to run the delete script via cron.
Unfortunatly my skills have alot to be desired lol, so best i get to
work on it :)
If anyones has any tips I would love to hear them :)

Yep your dead right,
In essence the frontend im scripting up, is for my own learning curve.
It has allowed me to pull apart many aspects of gpg that i would not
normally touch on. I doubt there will ever be a production version of
it, as it would be like reinventing the wheel. But it does allow me to
learn exactly how to incorporate gpg into regular php applications that
 i would like to have this feature.
Thanks for all your input, it has been a great help :)

Does anyone have solid written key signing policy?
I ask because i was just asked myself, and just gave a rough verbal of
my own policy. But i would like to see any others before i commit myself
to anything on paper.

You could just put a front-end on a particular gnupg install, and use it
as a basic keyserver. I have written a rough php front-end to gnupg to
do pretty much what you want ( I Think ). It can query a pubring for a
public key, update Public Keys and add public keys. If you want the
rough script, just send me an email and ill fire it off to you, it
should give you some idea's at least of how to do what you need.

Hash: SHA1
Since I just updated my ubuntu version of GunPG to 1.4.2, and noticed
this message to the list i thought I would upload the deb package I
put together. It's there if you want it basically :)
If you do use it, any feedback would be appreciated as to any problems
you might encounter. It worked fine for me, I only had to change the
path to the executable in enigmail to /usr/local/bin/gpg
