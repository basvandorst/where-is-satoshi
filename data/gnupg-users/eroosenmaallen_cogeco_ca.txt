Another alternative for an easy-to-use mail frontend is Mozilla with
Enigmail. It's pretty painless to set up, and it does signing, encrypting,
key pair generation, etc. right from the menus in Moz mail.
Site is  if you want to take a look.

Hash: SHA1
Hi all,
This message may be better suited for the dev mailing list, but maybe
someone here can help me.
I'm trying to compile GnuPG on my windows box, just to see how it works
(since I'm stuck with Windows, I may as well learn to hack in it).
I've downloaded the GnuPG source from CVS (STABLE-BRANCH-1-2). I'm using
MinGW 2.4 and MSYS 1.0.8. My Perl environment is ActiveState Perl 5.6.1.
When I try to make GnuPG, it reports a line of errors - I need automake,
autoconf and gettext. So, I downloaded them (automake-1.7, autoconf-2.57,
and gettext-0.11.5).
Trying to build automake, ./config and make both run OK, but make test fails
most of the tests. Some of them mention autoconf, so I tried to build that
Trying to build autoconf, ./config works, but make fails on general.pm.
First I got an error along the lines of "uninitialised scalar in chomp on
line 331", so I put a test around the chomp line to ensure the $tmp variable
is initialised. Now I'm getting "WIFEXITED is not a valid POSIX macto at
[bla bla bla] line 482". "perldoc POSIX" does list WIFEXITED as a macro in
the POSIX module, and it is mentioned in C:\perl\lib\POSIX.pm... This is
where I get lost - is there a safe and sane way to fix this or work around it?
Thanks (and if this is better for the dev list, please let me know),

There's a program, GPGOE, which allows OE to handle inline signing and

As an aside, you may want to consider other mail clients for your enterprise

not as prone to security flaws as Outlook Express.

When a key is created, the creation date is factored into the fingerprint=

@_subject: signature as attachment? 
Hash: SHA1
Assuming what you're looking for is PGP/MIME (the message itself is
unaltered, but it's sent as a multipart message, with the sig as an
attachment), here's how you do it:
* Enigmail menu > Advanced Preferences
* Mid-right is a frame labelled "Choose PGP/MIME Option"
* Select either "Allow PGP/MIME" or "Always use PGP/MIME"
I'm not sure what "Allow" means, but "Always use" is pretty clear.
One thing to consider is that if you're corresponding with Windows users,
they probably can't read PGP/MIME messages. Either the sig will be lost
(best case), or they will see a blank message (common case). There are very
few PGP/MIME compliant mailers for Windows (Moz/Engimail is an exception).

Hash: SHA1
Decryption alone doesn't need a passphrase - the pass is only used for
decryption and for signing. The unique ID is reasonably easy too - you can
use a serial number (1, 2, 3...), some combination of the date & time, or
the SMTP message-ID.
Are look looking to encrypt all _incoming_ mail to a certain address, or all
_outgoing_ mail?

Hash: SHA1
When you encrypt an email, it encrypts both to the recipient's public key
and to your own - this way you can read it as well as the recipient.
If you want to disable this for whatever reason, in the Enigmail > Advanced
Preferences dialog, there's an option to "Encrypt to Self".

@_subject: [Q] How do I revoke my old key? 
Hash: SHA1
Hi Daniel,
First you have to actually use the revocation certificate:
  $ gpg --import revcert.asc
This will mark the key as revoked in your keyring. Next, you send the
revoked key to keyservers. As a bare minimum, one LDAP and one HKP keyserver
should suffice.
You're as well off to hang onto the revoked key - you can decrypt with it,
even after it's revoked, and it's possible to end up with old copies of it
kicking around, which someone may use to encrypt to you.

Hi Daniel,
There are a couple options for Hotmail. The easiest is to use Outlook
Express and GPGOE (assuming OE can still access Hotmail). This makes it
reasonably painless to send/receive inline PGP messages.
The more complicated version is to use a GUI frontend like WinPT. Set
hotkeys to encrypt, sign, and sign/encrypt the current window, then when one
is done entering a message in the text box on the hotmail site, hit the
hotkey, and it'll usually GPG the text in the box (depends on the browser).

Hash: SHA1
Hi Daniel,
I use GPG on Windows.
The easy way to start using it is to download WinPT. WinPT is a GUI frontend
for GPG, and it comes with both the standard W32 build and the Nullify
build. WinPT lets you handle .gpg and .pgp files, detached sigs, etc. from
the Windows Explorer, lets you encrypt and/or sign text you're entering, etc.
The easiest and most effective mailer for W32 I've found is Mozilla with the
Enigmail plugin. It makes things pretty painless, and handles PGP/MIME
properly (It is, to my knowledge, the /only/ W32 mailer that fully supports

Hash: SHA1
Hi Servie,
I run into the same issue - I have with every past version of WinPT, as well
as with PGPFreeware 7-point-something. Make sure the area you want WinPT to
work with is selected - it isn't always immediately apparent. You can also
try selecting the text before executing the command (sometimes works,
sometimes doesn't).
Also, some software is uncooperative - At some point, Opera started using
custom widgets for many purposes, which simply won't work with the "current
window" mode. For these programs, the only practical way to do it is to cut
the text, work with it on the clipboard, then paste it.

@_subject: [Q] "sign" vs "sign-locally" 
Hash: SHA1
(bottom-posted, unusual for me)
To expand on Joseph's point, when you regularily "sign" a key, the signature
is exported with the key. This means that if you then send the key to a
keyserver, others downloading it will see your signature on the key. If they
assign a level of trust to *your* key, then your signature adds a level of
validity to the key, even if the person receiving it has not personally
verified it.
If you "locally sign" a key, your signature is not exported; it is only for
you. That way, your sig never affects the validity of the key on someone
else's keyring.

What you're seeing is a known problem with WinPT. Timo is working on it, but
currently the only fixes are to copy the registry keys under HKCU from one
user to the next, or to install WinPT as each user. The keys involved are:
