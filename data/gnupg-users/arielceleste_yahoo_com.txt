@_subject: importing key with GNU Privacy Assistant 
I have just recently installed the GPA to my Windows
2000 Pro box and the plug in that allows me to use it
with Outlook.
I received a key in a .asc file but cannot import it.
I looked through the archives but could not find this
so my apoligies if i missed it.
any tips?
