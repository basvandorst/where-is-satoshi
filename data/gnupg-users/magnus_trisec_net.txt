Has anyone had any luck in getting Digipass 920 to work with GnuPG and OpenPGP smartcards?
It has a pin-entry keypad and seems to work fine for doing a --card-status, but not for example signing:
"gpg: signing failed: Conditions of use not satisfied" after getting the normal pin entry window.
Would this be a problem with GnuPG not supporting Digipass 920 keypad and the digipass blocking access to the card if pin is not supplied by the keypad?
