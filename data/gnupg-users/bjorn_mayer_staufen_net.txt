@_subject: Problem with gpg --batch --gen-key 
Hi folks,
  I am trying to generate a key from within a Java application. Everything seems to go right,
  but at the beginning, everything stops. I have no idea what could be wrong...
  Anyone of you guys?
C:\>gpg --batch --gen-key
Key-Type: DSA
Key-Length: 1024
Subkey-Type: ELG-E
Subkey-Length: 1024
Name-Real: qwertz

%pubring C:\gpg\pubring.pgp
%secring C:\gpg\secring.pgp
  Every single hint will be very welcome!!!
    Bjorn
