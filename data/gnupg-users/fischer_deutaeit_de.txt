@_subject: libcrypt and RC2 revisited 
Hi all,
I have again the "I can't decode Outlook s/MIME mails" problem, 'cause I
receive mails from Outlook users that are obviously encrypted with 40bit
Just for my interest: In libgcrypt's rfc2268.c the RC2 algorithm is
implemented. But the ID for the RC2 the Outlook mails are sent is commented
out. Well, this seems to have a reason, since uncommenting and recompiling
libgcrypt 1.2.1 let gpgsm try to decrypt the mail, but without success (it
says no data). Where is the problem with this? Can I help in any way to
decode the Outlook mails?
Best regards,
Beste Gr??e,
Sven Fischer
