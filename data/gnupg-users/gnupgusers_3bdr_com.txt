@_subject: Vandalizing keyserver UID's 
This evening I've been working on stamping old public keys (long  since lost the secret key) with a bogus UID to inspire people to  avoid trying to use them.  I'm curious as to how I can tell the UID  is fake.  For example, here is the GPG output of --list-keys for one  of the keys I branded:
pub   1024D/DF71515D 2000-02-21
uid                  David Stults sig          DF71515D 2000-02-21  David Stults  uid                  DO NOT USE THIS KEY!
sig          DF71515D 2000-02-21  David Stults  sub   2048g/78B9A888 2000-02-21
sig          DF71515D 2000-02-21  David Stults  That seems to imply that even the bogus UID (the second one, as you  may have guessed ;-)) is in fact signed.
The keyserver displays it differently, but seems to make the same  uid DO NOT USE THIS KEY!
sig  sig   DF71515D 2000-02-21 __________ __________ [selfsig]
uid David Stults sig  sig   DF71515D 2000-02-21 __________ __________ [selfsig]
sub  2048g/78B9A888 2000-02-21
sig sbind  DF71515D 2000-02-21 __________ __________ []
Forgive me I've just been obtuse.  It isn't making sense to me, and  I'd like it to.  I want to be able to look at a public key and  determine if any bogus UID's have been added to it.  The only thing  I've noticed is that my newer keys say "sig 3", while the older ones  don't have a certification level given.
