@_subject: compiling gnupg-1.0.3 on our AIX 4.2.1 
Dear Sir/Madam,
We are in the process of installing gnupg-1.0.3 on our AIX system but
failed. The system type is PowerPC IBM running AIX4.2.1
The issue is that AIX4.2.1 has not got one of the assembly functions,
multiplication,  to compile one of the modules, mpih-div.c in gnupg-1.0.3.
Here is the error message after running make command.
mpih-div.c: In function `mpihelp_mod_1':
mpih-div.c:86: warning: implicit declaration of function `__udiv_w_sdiv'
mpih-div.c:100: Invalid `asm' statement:
mpih-div.c:100: fixed or forbidden register 64 (mq) was spilled for class
I would be most grateful if you know of any person who successfully compiles
gnupg-1.0.3 on AIX4.2.1 or if you could provide us any suggestions that
might be of assistance to me.
Best regards,

Hi Brian,
Thank you so much for your quick response.
We have tried to install version 1.0.4 on our system using AIX C compiler
(xlC) that you suggested on your email.
We found that both gcc and xlC can compile some assembly programs, such as
mpih-add1.s and mpih-sub1.s, but fail to get following assembly programs
A few questions:
1. Could you tell me if there is any free assembler for AIX 4.2.1 for
2. Is there any objective files compiled from AIX v4.2.1 available for
Kind regards,
