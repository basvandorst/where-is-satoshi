@_subject: C function to encrypt/decrypt data with gpg keys 
I want to have a C function to embed in my database, that will store the gpg keys and get data from the database, encrypt/decrypt it and send it back. For this I need to find a way to give the gpg command inside the function. Will 'sys()' call work for this, or will that be the wrong thing to do. What alternatives do I have for doing this? Thanks, Payal Singh
