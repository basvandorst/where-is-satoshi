@_subject: Encrypting when secret  keyring is not available 
I prefer to keep my secret keyring in a flash memory stick.
The public keyring is always on my disk.
Sometimes I want to encrypt a message when my memory stick is
not available. The public keyring is available. However, Gnupg
will NOT encrypt a message when a secret keyring is not available.
I know I can have an empty file on the disk be my substitute secret keyring, but then I have to change the "secret-keyring"
entry in my gpg.conf file every time I insert or remove my
memory stick.
Does anyone know a better solution for this problem?
