@_subject: Get expiration date by searching on keyservers 
I use '--keyserver  --search-keys  to get info on a number of
keys. As far as I can tell, that doesn't return an expiration date (if
that exists).
Are there other ways to easily check on the exp. date, besides importing
the key and then verifying the expiration date?

@_subject: recv-keys on e-mail instead of keyid 
I have a list of email addresses and I want to query the keyservers if a
keyid exists for them.
"recv-keys" expects a keyid ... what's the best way to check -scripted?-
if a key exists for an email address?
Key verification etc. will be done afterwards via OoB.
