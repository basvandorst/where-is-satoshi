I asked Vic about this a while back and he said that the
Victor_A_Abell.pgp file does not have any problems with PGP, only
$ gpg --recv-keys 40BD3D55
worked but I still get
$ gpg --import Victor_A_Abell.pgp gpg: WARNING: using insecure memory!
gpg: please see  for more information
gpg: key 40BD3D55: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1

I am such at PGP & GPG dilettant that I don't really know what to do
next about this.
I did just a moment ago but I doubt he's going to change his mind
about this being a compatiblity issue between PGP and GPG.
