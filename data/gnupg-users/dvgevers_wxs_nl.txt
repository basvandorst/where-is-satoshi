Hash: SHA1
Hi, For several years I have been using PGP but as NAI has stopped further development I decided to look into GnuPG. I am completely new to GnuPG and it took me several hours to get it working because there is a small inaccuracy in the file readme.w32: It says quote 4. If you did not use the default directory "c:\gnupg", you     should enter a string with the directory into the Registry     under the key: 	 \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\GnuPG\HomeDir     Please use forward slashes and not the backslashes when     setting filenames for GnuPG into the Registry. unquote Since my C:\ drive is FAT32 I find it unreliable for storing files such as those of GPG and do so on an NTFS drive. Today I downloaded GnuPG 1.0.6 and GPGShell for Windows v. 2.25 and the QDGPG plugin for Pegasus Mail. I couldn't get any of these to work okay until I found the page  The problem is there shouldn't be a Regkey \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\GnuPG\HomeDir but rather \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\GnuPG with a string value called "HomeDir" containing as data the path to the GPG.exe directory. Moreover the mention that forward slashes must be used is unnecessary and un-windows like: backward slashes work fine. Regards =Dick Gevers=

u are right that there is nothing like a man page
ry, I must disagree. The file gpg.man does contain the command

I installed GPG this weekend and if you open gpg.ma=
n with any text editor the whole man page is visible.

@_subject: Local signatures v. exportable signatures 
Hash: SHA1
Recently I started using GnuPG 1.0.6 under W2K, together with GPGShell for Win v. 2.25.
Neither on the command line nor in GPGShell can I see any difference between a locally signed key and a key bearing an exportable signature. I know which are which but I don't want to remember it, I would like to be able to see which is what. Now the only difference I can find is when the key is exported, but
I would like to see it while the keys are on my pubring, either in GPG and/or in GPGShell. I would appreciate any advice.
Best regards,

Recently I started using GnuPG 1.0.6 under W2K, together with GPGShell for Win v. 2.25.
Neither on the command line, nor in GPGShell can I generate RSA keys or use other non-default algorithms, ciphers or hashes. I looked through all the FAQ's, help files, man pages and Handbooks that I could find and tried every possible combination of the
