I've installed GPG and more or less worked out what to do with it.
The part that I can't work out is how to tell GPG where my keys are.  By
that I mean the floppy drive a:.  How do I tell it to check the floppy
drive ?

Dear all
Thanks for your help
As an aside to this I thought I'd mention that when I did "man gpg" I
"No man page due to missing docbook-to-man"
So, maybe it's missing ?  Downloaded from.....
Thanks :-)

Dear All
I was taught an old joke by the British Army back in 1988.  That was
when I was still something to do with the services in the UK.  It goes
like this......
BLOWFISH:  Something that you can use between the wife's legs when you
are too tired to do anything for her (you know how it is ?  All those
assault course tire you out ? )
TWOFISH:  Something that you can use on the wife and the mistress as
well at the same time when you are too tired to do anything for either
of them.
Perhaps someone may not be telling the truth on this list ?

Well, I've run a few tests with it and I'd say that I prefer it to
Hotmail or Yahoo mail.  What's the server running on, is it open
source software or NT4 / Win 2000 ?  At least there is some form of
encryption there :)  Better than nothing.

@_subject: GNUpg 1.0.6 
Dear All
I've downloaded and installed GNUpg 1.0.6 into my SuSE 7.1=20
workstation from the SuSE ftp site.
I find that it works fine apart from one small niggling little=20
problem.  I can't decrypt e-mail from other GNUpg users.
I have tried to set the default key in order to get GNUpg to decrypt=20
so that I can read mail.  All that happens when I try to do that is=20
that GNUpg immediately asks me to "Go ahead and type your=20
message..... ".  It will not allow me to set the default key.
Can anyone explain what I'm supposed to do to get GNUpg to decrypt a=20
message ?

No, where's the options file in SuSE 7.1 ?
Yes, but...  if I type ' gpp --default-key richard  it=20
just asks me to go ahead and type my message.
I use Kmail although I prefer Pine.  Tried the options in Kmail for=20
version 1.2 and can't get it to work.
No, didn't like that either :(

@_subject: Expiry Date 
This one has probably been seen on this list before.  Been through the manual and the docs.  I can find what I am looking for but it doesn't work with my version of GnuPG 1.2.1.
I'd like to update my subkey so that it never expires.  At the moment it looks like this...
pub  1024D/E233C898  created: 2002-08-01 expires: never  trust:f/f
sub  2048g/48F969EB  created: 2002-08-01 expires: 2003-08-01
(1). Richard Ibbotson Can anyone suggest how to do this ?
I've tried 'gpg --edit-key richard  But, when I try to change the date on the subkey by selecting the subkey with 'expire' gpg just selects the primary key and not the subkey.  If I try 'expire 2' it still doesn't work.
Any suggestions ?  I don't want to delete the subkey.  I'm afraid that I might not be able to put it back again.

Yes.  Exporting it doesn't result in an update on the server.  Don't ask me why I don't know.

@_subject: GPG 1.2.2 released? 
Just downloaded gnupg-1.2.2.tar.gz and also .. gnupg-1.2.2.tar.gz.sig Then I did...
gpg --verify gnupg-1.2.2.tar.gz.sig
Which produced this ....
gpg: Signature made Thu 01 May 2003 16:10:15 BST using DSA key ID gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
This was with a trusted installation of GnuPG 1.2.1.  Anyone know why --verify failed and what should I do next so that I can install the 1.2.2 version ?

@_subject: GnuPG Upgrade Problems 
Wasn't sure whether to send this into a Debian list or a GnuPG list.  Mailed my request for help here because I thought Werner might want to read about it...
My own workstation was running Debian testing back in February.  For various reasons I was only able to upgrade through Debian Sarge to the latest testing about two weeks ago.  After upgrading I found that the box was asking to install GnuPG2 from the Debian site.  I have already installed GnuPG 1.9.11 from source from the GnuPG.org site.   The GnuPG file that wants to install itself is...  I've checked the MD5 sum for this.  It's correct.  Without this the system can't update itself and I can't install any updates.  Can anyone offer any advice how to get out of this without breaking anything ?  More info below...

I haven't used because I only have access to GNU/Linux desktops.  It's supposed to be reliable.  Used Pegasus a lot when I was still using winduhs a long time ago.
