Hash: SHA1
I have a couple questions I have not been able to figure out on my own.
First, and probably easiest: Is it possible to put a photo into a
key?  I see some keys have it, but have not figured how to do it.
Second: I have a Thawte Freemail certificate. I have Enigmail set to
use it.  How do I import it, or whatever, it into my GNUpg keyring?  I
see several have done it.
Thanks in advance.

I have been trying to figure out what all GPG will do.
I do not see any notes on how to run gpg-agent.  I went thru the
session manager, and placed it as a startup program.  The only problem
with this is I keep noticing I have several copys running if I have
rebooted the system several times.
Is this the right mailing list to discuss GPA?  There are too many
problems to mention before finding out if this is the correct place to
address it.

I have Fedora FC4. with all available updates.
I am using GPG 1.4.1 and v1.9.18 is also installed.
The GPA is version 0.7.0
My Firestarter firewall is set to let all traffic out, and is not
showing as blocking anything when I try.
First I bring up GPA.  Then I click on my default key set. Next I
select 'Server', then 'Send Keys...'
It asks me if I am sure I want to distribute the selected keys to:
Most of the time I will get the error:
*    "An error occurred while contacting the server:"
    "Internal keyserver error"
Note there is an empty line between the two.
If I do not get this error, it says:  '*Connecting to server
"hkp://subkeys.pgp.net".  Please wait.*'
and nothing happens till I click on the X to close the window, then I
get the original error.
This happens with this server, and any of the default servers GPA has
on its default list.
Let me know if you need any other information.
