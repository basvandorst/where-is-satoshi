@_subject: Convert "Sign Only" Primary Key 
a time ago I created a "Sign Only" DSA Key with an ElGamal Encrypt
Subkey. Now I noticed that it is not possible to encrypt a message with
PGP to this Public Key because PGP only sees the "sign only" primary Key
and not the encrypting subkey.
Ist there a possibility to convert the "Sign Only" primary Key to a
"Sign and Encrypt" Key?
Any other possibilitys to use this Key, so it is compatible with PGP?
Many thanks for Your help!

Maybe You missunderstand my procederes:
$ gpg --gen-key
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) DSA and ElGamal (default)
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
Here I selected "2". After the key creation I did a:
Command> addkey
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (3) ElGamal (encrypt only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (5) RSA (encrypt only)
Here I selected "3".
This key does not work with PGP5 for encryption. Only for signing.

Ok, a bit more tries. Meanwhile I could locate the error. It's does not
matter what kind of Subkey I use. The expiration Date is the only
Problem. When the subkey is created with the addkey command with no
expiration Date, the exported public Key can be used with PGP5 for
encrypting. But when I afterwards set the expiration Date with the
"expire" command, the Key becomes again a "Sign Only" public Key for
PGP5. So now the strange thing. When I try to set the expiration Date
again to unlimited on the existing Key, export again - the Key is also
just a "Sign Only" Key! At least for my pgp5i Version from debian/oldstable.
There must be some difference how GnuPG 1.4.1 sets the expiration Date
on Subkey creation and the Menu Option "expire".
Can someone verify this?
