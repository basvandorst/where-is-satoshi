@_subject: Scripting and CGI use of GPG 
The most common problems I have when doing this stuff are, making sure
the user that Apache is running as (usually "nobody" or "www") has all
the right permissions to do what it needs (read keyrings, etc), and
making sure gpg knows where the keyrings live.  You also need to make
sure that all the keys you're using are trusted, or it'll spit out a
prompt asking you "are you sure" or something.
The user Apache runs as (I'll use "nobody" as an example) shouldn't
have a shell or home directory.  To test permissions as user nobody,
you can be root and "su -m nobody" before running the script in the
shell.  This leaves the environment and shell the same as they were
when you were root, so it doesn't test things exactly as if you were
running in Apache, but it will tell you if permissions are correct or

@_subject: Problems compiling gpg with FreeBSD 2.2.6 
Hello there.
I had some problems compiling GnuPG 0.9.9 for FreeBSD 2.2.6.  I
resolved them and was able to compile successfully, but I'm wondering
if there was a Better Solution than twiddling the code directly, and
if this is a known problem.
The problem:
Source files mpi/*.S were compiling with incorrect symbols, missing
the leading underscore.  For example, mpih-add1.S was producing a .o
with the single symbol "mpihelp_add_n" instead of "_mpihelp_add_n".
This left a bunch of unresolved symbols in libmpi at link time.
I solved this by going into mpi/*.S and prepending underscores to all
of the symbols.  This worked, but I can't help but think there's a
better way, maybe a switch to gcc or something, to produce the correct
symbols, since obviously others aren't having the same problem on
other platforms.
GNU Make version 3.76.1
gcc version 2.7.2.1
Any other vital stats required?
Thanks for any clues anyone can lend me; I'll go see if it works now.

I took care of this problem by using gmake instead of make on freebsd
2.2.6.  But after I got the make to stop crashing, I started having
unresolved symbols in libmpi.  I fixed that by manually prepending an
underscore to the symbols in mpi/*.S, but I think there must be a
better way than tweaking the code directly.  I asked about this
yesterday but no one has gotten back to me about it yet.
