Hash: SHA1
Before reinstalling my operating system on this computer, I saved my
.gnupg folder.  After the reinstall, I copied over the folder to
my home directory.  My secret key was recognized, just fine, but
I did not have the corresponding public key.  I used gpgsplit to
extract my public key.  Now, what I am wondering is this.
When I export my public key on my computer with:
gpg --armor --export tss at member.fsf.org
I get:

Thanks for the prompt reply.
Another difference that I have noticed is that sometimes FireGPG
notifies me that a message I have signed is not valid.  That
seems strange to me because: (a) it only happens intermittently and
(b) FireGPG is the program that is doing the actual signing.  Of
course, this could be an issue with FireGPG and not with my key
situation.  Encypting and decrypting appear to work fine.
The output of gpg --list-keys and gpg --list-secret-keys print out
what I would expect.  Would you say there probably is not a
problem?  I'm having a difficult time imagining where the source
of error might come from.  The only thing I can think of is the
extracting of the public key.
