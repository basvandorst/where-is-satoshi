@_subject: key security 
I'm new to the list and GnuPG. I have some small (newbie) questions.
1/ What about key security. Do you people all leave your private key on
the harddisk of your machine. On Debian linux that's in the .gnupg
directory. How about putting this whole directory on removable media
(for example diskette) A colleague of mine has his on a remove USB
media. Good idea? reactions? impractical?
2/ To encrypt a message all I need is the recipients public key, right?
Encryption is done solely with the public key of the recipient. My
private key is not used, is this correct?
A confused newbie.

@_subject: using keys with multiple users 
I use GnuPG at work. My question is how can you use GnuPG with different
people. For example you have the following situation. I receive and send
mail using the following aliases
Mails sent as hostmaster are CC'ed to everybody in the hostmaster group.
The same is true for support.
Currently I only encrypt/sign mail with my own address
I was wondering how we could encrypt/sign messages as
hostmaster and support
Does anybody work with such a setup?

@_subject: practical compatibility GnuPG/PGP 
Me and a colleague are trying to setup secure email communication.
Problem is that my colleague uses PGPfreeware 7.0.3 on windows. Up until
now we were able to exchange public keys and verified them. When I
receive a message from him I can decrypt it form the commandline.
However my mailclient mutt doesn't seem to recognize the message as an
encrypted message. I used the tutorial on
 to configure mutt. Section
XIV. Configuring Mutt For Use With GnuPG. Could anybody tell me what to
adjust so that mutt recoginzes PGP encrypted messages?
Also when I sent an encrypted message to my colleague PGP doesn't
recognize it neither. I read something in the faq about compatibility
 I added the 'compress-algo 1' line to
my options file but no luck. Any other things to look for.
Or perhaps somebody can round up some of the issues, small list, what to
do exactly?
That would be great.

I just discovered this on the mutt site.
Q: "People are sending PGP messages which mutt doesn't
    recognize.  What can I do?"
    The new way is to leave headers alone and use mutt's
    check-traditional-pgp function, which can detect PGP messages at
    run-time, and adjust content-types.
But I find no further reference for this 'check-traditional-pgp'
function. What is it? Where must I specify it?
Actually just realized this might be off-topic since it is purely a mutt
thing. Sorry
