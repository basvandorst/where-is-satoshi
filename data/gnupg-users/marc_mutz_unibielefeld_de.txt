Shouldn't gnupg be more generous in what it accepts here? Eg. rfc2045 explicitly requires MUA's to simply ignore any non-base64 character in a base64 encoding, because MTA's are known to add and remove trailing whitespace for their convenience. Ditto for QP. Since radix64 _is_ base64, I think these rules should apply to OpenPGP ascii-armoured messages, too. (and looking into rfc2440, 6.4, I see, they do).

I don't think that adding your fingerprint to your (mail) signature/footer is wise. It only leads people to believe it and not check it properly. Mail can be faked very easily. Even signing doesn't help here, because the peer can't be sure that there wasn't someone on the way that substituted the fingerprint and ID on the way and signed the mail it himself after removing yours.
The best way to distribute your public key is to upload it to the keyservers and always sign all your messages. This shows people that you not only own a PGP key, but that you also use it actively.

Your considerations have the following flaw:
You can't argument with past sent mails, because they can also be forged (in archives, etc.). Given, it's not easy to do this, but it is Also, you forgot about the factor "human". If you put your fingerprint into you mail's footer, it is of course saying nothing without the context of many mails. Only if all the mails you have sent have an identical fingerprint value in their footer, one can begin to be sure that it's the right one (only begin, because Mallory, sitting on a smtp relay near you, could have forged all the messages you've sent from the beginning on. You wouldn't have guessed anything, because Mallory of course would send back the unforged mails to you). BUT:
Who in the world does this?
Right, nobody.
This leads people to sign your key based on the fingerprint in your footer. Now, in the best case, this signature is not considered at all because no-one out there trusts it, but in the worst case, people rely on this single signature to validate the wrong key and - bingo. Mallory is where he wants to be.
The only secure way to exchange signatures is when you have the passport of the person - and the person ! - in front of you and she gives you her public key, or the key id with the fingerprint.
You're paranoid enough to use a 4kbits key and include your fpr in your footer ;-)

Basically, yes. You go to key-signing parties of your local -User-Group or bug people on expos. Or you search for people you may get your hands on using the keyserevers.
E.g. I went to LinuxTag and collected signatures from the debian people there and I searched the pgp.net servers for uni-bielefeld.de, which brings up people that are at my university. I then try to organize a keysigning event.

print the output of
gpg --fingerprint --list-keys several times (_many_ times if you want to go to somting as big as LinuxTag - calculate in the 50-or-more regime) and sign it (by hand, i.e. with a pen as you would sign a contract). The others will do the same and on the event, you just exchange these papers.
After a look at the other one's passport or driving license (or whatever -see different thread), you sign _his_ paper and take it home with you. There, you compare the fingerprints on the paper with the one shown by GnuPG from the downloaded pubkey and if they match, you sign the peer's key and send it to him.
You may additionally send an encrypted "ping" message to all UIDs on the peer's key before signing just to make sure that the peer is in fact in control of all UIDs and has the secret key.

Yes, this is also advisable. However, I can come along and add Marc Mutz  to my list of UIDs and - given such a user (e.g. Micheal Mutz) exists, and he hasn't got a PGP key on the keyserver (yet), my key is produced on a search.
It comes down hoe 'hard' you personal certification policy is. Some certify onlt the name part and don't care about the mail addresses (e.g. c't pgpCA) and others (e.g. P. Palfrader) check the mail addresses, too.

Sorry to have posted such an incomplete message threat. Actually, the discussion was confined to attaching keys. We have menu options for that in KMail and so we definitely know what the attachment will contain. Currently, we encode the stuff we get back from gnupg/pgp in base64. I posted a patch to change that to 7bit, on the assumption that armor'ed output did not contain 8but chars. Then:
Hm, rfc2015 is very sparse w.r.t. how application/pgp-keys should be handled/encoded. The _complete_ section reads:

@_subject: HOWTO on interfacing with gnupg/pgp? 
Is it ready for production yet?
Will it be binary compatible within minor revision numbers?
Does it support PGP?
If one of the questions' answers is 'no', then we can't use gpgme (yet).
We would love to get rid of the interface coding for various PGP/GPG versions, but if this means that we need to depend on an ever-changing lib which doesn't support PGP, we can't do it.
What I really need is some example code for "how to do it right". Not only for gnupg, but also for pgp. I'll have a look at some of the stuff listed under "frontend" on the gnupg homepage, but someone could point me to a specific frontend that "does it right", I'd be very thankful.

@_subject: HOWTO on interfacing with gnupg/pgp? 
I'll have a look at gpgme's interfacing with gpg, but I am currently more interested in design _principles_ than in details.
It's just that the KDE team just had a bad experience with the OpenSSL 0.9.5->0.9.6{,a} transition, which broke BC, IIRC. One developer went and started his own crypto lib because of that (no, I'm not advocating that. In fact, I'm extremely opposed to that idea and hope that it will never be adopted. The world doesn't need yet another crypto lib).
We happen to support PGP up to v6.x. If we were to start from scratch _now_, we'd probably restrict ourselves to supporting gnupg via gpgme. I certainly don't want to write _new_ interface classes for these programs, but we should keep the possibility to interface with old pgp In the light of the critical passphrase handling issues in KMail's pgp/gpg interface, I just wanted to extend my auditing of the (passphrase storing) high-level class to the low-level interface classes. In this framework I'm currently working. Thus cometh my question on how to best interface with _this kind of_ programs securely. And probably a little bit on how to best handle passphrases in the frontend.
So switching to gpgme isn't an option ATM, since we are in feature freeze for the upcoming KDE 2.2beta and final releases.

@_subject: HOWTO on interfacing with gnupg/pgp? 
Hi again!
I'm playing with the thought of using gpgme for KDE2.3's KMail. BUT:
Quoting the web page:
GPGME is still work in progress, so don't expect that everything works and be careful when using production quality secret keys. Quoting the web page:
GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a library designed to make access to GnuPG easier for applications. It provides a High-Level Crypto API for encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification and key management. Currently it uses GnuPG as it's backend but the API isn't restricted to this engine; in fact it is planned to add other backends to it. Pay esp. attention to the last sentence.
I must admit that I'm confused.
What if we ship a KDE-2.3 which requires the then-current gpgme. Will that one (in three or four months from now) be ready for "production quality secret keys"?
What if we port our current pgp interfacing to be a backend to gpgme? Will this code be accepted for inclusion or do we have to maintain it as a patch and tell people: "Patch gpgme yourself if you want pgp

Hash: SHA1
If you send each listed mail address a different random string, each encrypted with the public key of which it is a UID, you make sure that the person that gave you the slip (and that owns the key) really controls all the mail addresses listed in the UID's.
E.g. I could have added "Graham Mutz " as a UID if I really was Graham Mutz of, say, Gnome. I could then intercept, read and answer mails you sent to mutz and bribe you into using Gnome instead of KDE ;-) if you didn't bother to check whether mutz is really me or some other Mutz (with this christian name, this is unlikely, but think s/Mutz/Smith/g)
