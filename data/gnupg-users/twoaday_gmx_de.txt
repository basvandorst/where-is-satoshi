gpg --gen-prime 1 10000
gpg: Ohhhh jeeee: ... this is a bug (random.c:274:read_pool)
secmem usage: 0/0 bytes in 0/0 blocks of pool 0/16384
it seems to be a buffer overflow, isn't it?
(sorry if this was already posted!)

Yes of course.
For this you must use the gpg command "--edit-key"
Then you can use the option "adduid" to add a new user id
and save this changes with the "save" option.

@_subject: GnuPG Win32: secmem warning 
I have a problem that concern the win32 version of GnuPG (1.0.1a).
It is possible to disable the message that say the system
don't have secure memory ?
For example I try the --quiet and the --no-secmem-warning
option but gpg print out the message again.
Next I try to put the no-secmem-warning in the config
file in the gpg directory, without any success.
