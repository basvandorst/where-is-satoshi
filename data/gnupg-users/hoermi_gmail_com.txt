@_subject: wrong gpg-agent version running? 
I've recently upgraded to Debian buster, and then upgraded gpg by
downloading and installing the new version 2.2.17.
Now, I get this warning:
$ gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.17
libgcrypt 1.8.4
$ which gpg-agent
$ /usr/local/bin/gpg-agent --version
gpg-agent (GnuPG) 2.2.17
libgcrypt 1.8.4
$ gpgconf --list-dirs
$ whereis gpg-agent
gpg-agent: /usr/bin/gpg-agent /usr/local/bin/gpg-agent
$ /usr/bin/gpg-agent --version
gpg-agent (GnuPG) 2.2.12
libgcrypt 1.8.4
$ echo $PATH
I've even tried to add agent-program /usr/local/bin/gpg-agent to gpg.conf
I don't know why the "wrong" agent gets started, can you please help me?

Thank you, that was it.
I edited /usr/lib/systemd/user/gpg-agent.service directly and changed
the ExecStart and ExecReload paths.

This worked! Perfect! :)
I created the .d directory and only overwrote ExecStart and ExecReload
as you suggested.
Thank you for the short lesson in systemd, I didn't know about this

This is not a bug in debian, they ship with 2.2.12 [1]. I manually
installed 2.2.17 from source.
