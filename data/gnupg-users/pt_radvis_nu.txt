PGP doesn't have any e-mail plug-in for Eudora any longer.
PGP doesn't seem to have any support for the latest OutlookExpress 6=20
either. But that might be an error on the webpage?

I have got several USB-devices. One, a Pen Drive, is formatted like one 1.44 MB bootable virtual USB floppy drive and one larger USB-drive. I suppose the larger part can be formatted differently from the virtual floppy. Will that help?
I haven't tried to install some UNIX on it yet. Unfortunately that would not make it possible to use WinPT. I suppose the GPA might be useful. Has anybody tried something similar?

I am using GPG Relay for casual encryption and signing. It's the easiest GUI I have ever seen! It's nearly invisible! But there has to be a power user somewhere to install and configure it. But after setup anyone, even my small children and my grandmother can send encrypted mail. They would NEVER use PGP.

I have found PGP too complicated for most people. We had a discussion on this list "Why isn't everybody doing it". I know lots of people who should use encryption but keep sending confidential information unencrypted because they find it to hard to encrypt.
GPG has got a much better GUI for Windows: GPG Relay. Andreas John has made a wonderful tool. You'd better try it! There are som bugs left (some trouble with keymanagement i WindowXP) but it will be fixed in the next release (coming soon!). I am testing an improved development version. Download the latest stable version (stable in Windows98) here:

This is an excellent idea! But then GPG must look for the right keyring for the right user ...
It would be very good be able to use different keyrings for different users. What if one user would like his key on disk, but an other would like it on un external USB-disk? It would be fine if it was possible to choose keyring-paths individually by user!

A great idea! That would be very convenient for users. But would users take care of them selves? Maybe it would be useful to have a link to some page about trust on that page ...
Should anyone offering a distribution have the right to publish a link on the GPG-site? Or should it be some means for qualification? I would be happy if you put a link to my "simple tools ei batch-files" and what ever that I will produce after that ...

I agree with you Kyle! And this is a very important step to spread encryption (cf the discussion "Why isn't everone doing it?). Encryption must become invisible to be used by everyone. Thus much effort and brains should be used to design this service. It will the base to build encryption clients (invisible GUI) to users in the future. It's about the future for GPG! If it's done right it will have an enormous impact!
It might be sufficient with the simple CA-robot you have designed. It does the same job as the "sign up for a Microsoft Passport account"-procedure, doesn't it? It just checks that a person has access to a certain e-mail adress.
It might be a good idea to add a check that the person has access to the secret key as well eg by demanding a signed respons. That would add some value to the service.
But it might be too complicated for the users? Or can it be made automatically by the client? Would it be easy to add such features to GPGOE, Eudora GPG and GPG Relay?
When I tested the service I thought a while about what happens if some one (not me) sends my key to the robot-CA. And if someone sends a bogus key to the robot.
It wouldn't be much harm, would it?
The only feasible misuse I can think of is:
The Evil cracker E creates an e-mail adress in my name at eg. Hot Mail. He creates a PGP-key for that adress and get it signed by the robot. He then pretends to be me and fools some of my contacts to establish a "secure" communication with him. What's the countermeasure? To check e-mails accounts by phone?
Well, what about MS Passport? Microsoft have never phoned me to check my Anyhow, it might be very important to verify the connection either between the person and the e-mail adress (that's how people think "What's the adress to ... How is his phonenumber?) or between the person and the key (that's how cryptographers think!). Either will fill the gap:
The triangle connections between person-emailadress-key will be verified.
But I don't know how that will be accomplished! It doesn't matter if you introduce a "signing challenge". It will NOT verify any connection to the live person. It will only produce a false feeling of security and ad complexity. Thus I think the CA-robot is fine as it is!
The verification of the connection person - emailadress cannot be made by ANY robot! Any ideas how to do that verification? For X.509 certificates this is made eg. by sending a mail that is to be collected in person at the post office, where the receiver has to show an identification card. I think this isn't completely safe and besides it is overdoing it for the purpose of "safe e-mail for everyone". Why not use business cards, snail mail and phone, tell people about your e-mailadress and ask other people. Thats what we all are doing anyway, isn't it?
People would ask people about their e-mail address, but they would rather not ask about their PGP-key fingerprint!
Thus I think the robot is wonderful as it is! I will recommend it to people.

And the Robot-CA would be quite helpful against forged senders!
I believe it can be important for verifying software as well, that's why I am eager to have the ability to have signingkeys signed by the robot.

Well, Kyle would have to collect a lot of wellknown signatures to build a web of trust for his robot. Quite feasable.
And there might be some more robots with their own web of trust. That would offer an opportunity to choose which robots to trust. Today Granny would have to ask Alice, but tomorrow a trusted e-mail software provider might to the choice.

This is interesting! What can be done about this? Change the e-mailadress and the key? I don't see any way to prevent it.
If it becomes frequent some verifikation of the link person - key must be added. Or is there any work around?
How does MS Passport (and similar services) work? Passport will not mind if the e-mail address is used by several people? It's very common on the web with services that just validates the e-mail address. And they seem to work so far ...

No, Granny will NEVER read any fingerprints!
And Alice might tell Granny to use the robot, (if it's not done automatically by her software). And ask her about which e-mail adress she uses.
NB This can be implied TODAY with GPG and GPG Relay + key submission to the In the near future it can be done invisibly by e-mail software!

Your are right! Besides, X.509-certicates usually will expire in one year. So it might not be any big fuzz if the signatures from the Robot-CA expires.

I agree that in cases where real secrecy is needed other means of key verification than the Web of Trust have to be used.
I agree that the robotCA is useful. Verifying e-mail addresses ei establishing the connection key - e-mail address is important for casual encryption, as someone else has stated as well.
In fact I was a little confused about the signing levels at first, because I wanted to make exportable signatures on keys when I had verified only the e-mail address, but didn't find any appropriate signing level. Thus I only put exportable signatures on keys when I have checked the identity of the keyholder - and that's not very frequent.
I think it's fine if the robot uses level 1 (casual check) -signatures, but in the future I would like to introduce a new level: "I have checked the e-mail address only". I would find it very helpful. And I would sign a lot of keys and help some other people that might not use the robot.
I still think it would be more natural for most people to verify the connection between the e-mail address and the person. (And it's easier to check on e-mail address by phone than reading fingerprints!) Thus a verification of the connection between the e-mail address and the key would be helpful.
But as someone else have stated: In many cases it is sufficient just to establish the connection between the e-mail address and the key. It doesn't really matter who the person behind the address is. That makes it even more helpful with verification of e-mail addresses.
As to PGP and old software I have noticed that e.g. PGP 6.5.8 doesn't notice expired signatures! It put me off from starting a CA-services last year, because I didn't want the CA-signatures to have an eternal life. But now that Kyle Hasselbacher has started his robot I might think it over again. Or rather I will encourage people to use his robot. Important features must be introduced and used. They might even encourage people to Per Tunedal

Hello Nick,
I compared PGP and GPG Relay. GPG Relay is a not better "as is". It's only better for most users as it makes encryption effortless. It makes encryption VERY easy but obviously somewhat less safe. I believe it's very important to spread encryption and thus I promote GPG Relay for casual encryption. I believe it's a GUI that might spread encryption rapidly.
WinPT is good, but not easy to learn. I promote WinPT as well for more sophisticated users. PGP is still more easy to use than WinPT, but WinPT has improved significantly lately and continues to improve.

I have noticed that some signed messages to this mailinglist are BAD as well. I haven't made such a thorough research as you, though. I suppose PGP-MIME messages would be more reliable because there is kind of an envelope. But I have other problems with those: all PGP or GPG plug-ins/frontends does not seem to like each others messages. I haven't got very deep into that either.

I supposed it would be some help to Mallory to possess the plaintext when attacking the encrypted text. Cf the Rosette stone used for "deciphering" the hieroglyphs ...
3a. Mallory gets the symmetric message key by attacking the message with some help from the plain text.
3b. Mallory attacks the encrypted session key with some help from the plain session key.
3c. Mallory gets the secret key used for encrypting the session key.

I would like to suggest an improvement for detached signatures. When I sign a file with "gpg --detach-sign filename.txt" I get the output "filename.sig" . Then I have to change the output filename to "filename.txt.sig" to be able to check the signature with "gpg --verify filename.txt.sig"  (If I use "gpg --verify filename.sig" I get an error because gpg cannot find the signed file.)
Why not always keep the original filename and just add .sig when signing?

Gustavo Vasconcelos helped me improve some simple batch-files that are very useful for everyday tasks: importing keys, checking signatures and signing. I have found them especially useful together with GPG Relay: You don't need any other key manager. You  just need GPG, GPG Relay, and something like my simple batch files. You can send keys to keyservers with your Internet browser.
You may download the files at my new site:
The files are signed with this key:

The key is available at keyservers or at:

HOW TO USE THESE BAT-FILES
1. Extract them to a suitable folder eg. C:\Windows\Programs\Clipanish
2. Make short cuts to them in the "SEND TO"-folder for the user
eg. C:\Documents and Settings\USER\SendTo
3. Right-click on any file in Windows Explorer, choose "Send to" and the preferred action.

GPG works fine, but GPGV is unusable! I cannot make it find my keyring when verifying signatures and thus I get an errormessage.
It works OK verifying the signatures with GPG instead.
Why does not GPGV use the same settings as used by GPG?

I have problems with verifying files with detached signatures on a computer with Windows98SE. It works OK on WindowsXP.
gpg --verify filename.asc or gpgv filename.asc doesn't work. It gives an error message.
When used on a computer with WindowsXP the file "filename" is checked against the signature in the file filename.asc
Maybe it has something to do with MS-DOS filenames in Windows 98?

@_subject: Why subkeys? 
Hash: SHA1
Subkeys are very useful. You kan create a subkey for encryption with a shorter validity than the primary (signing) key. Thus you can create a new encryption key shortly before the subkey expires and keep the signatures on your primary key.
- - If someone ever will be able to attack one of your encryption keys, that person will only be able to read documents encrypted to you during a limited time.
- - People you communicate with can trust your new encryption keys, because they have already signed your primary key.

Hi Jonathan,
well I tried that as my second guess. But that didn't work either.
Short names work OK.
Thus: GPG cannot figure out the name of the signed file because the DOS-names are completely different.
Does any one have a VBS-script instead?

@_subject: E-Mail Encryption: Why Isn't Everyone Doing It? 
Hash: SHA1
I agree with all people telling that users will not use anything that makes e-mailing more complicating. Especially pass phrases are a great obstacle. Many people hate them.
An other great obstacle is that people don't want to learn anything about encryption. And thus cannot take any responsibility for their own security. They can (and will!) do a lot of mistakes that compromises their security.
- - The idea to have two different passphrases: one for signing and one for decryption is brilliant. It would make it possible to have a greater protection for the signing key and doing automatic decryption. That is important: you can have a signing key with a long life and regularly change the encryption keys (without loosing the signatures on your signing key and thus "transferring" the trust to the new encryption subkeys you create).
- - I belive GPG Relay is a great way in the right direction. It does automatic tasks of your choice: encryption, signing, decryption, verifying. You can choose to enter your passphrase as needed, cache your passphrase for a specified time or for the session, or enter it to the program once and use it for ever. One great advantage is that you can choose your security level and set it according to your security needs. And it is possible to use one key for automatic tasks with GPG Relay and an other for more sensitive tasks with more traditional interfaces like WinPT or plug-ins for e-mail programs. - - Key exchange is still complicated. Why not automatically download keys from keyservers for all e-mail adresses in your address book? And do the same whenever you add a new adress? It would be fine with such a feature in the plug-ins for Outlook Express and Eudora!
- - Authentication is still complicated though. I recently discovered a security risk that i had not ever thought about before. I verified key-data (fingerprint) by phone with a person I knew. All seemed OK, but during the conversation it occurred to me that the keypair was not created nor controlled by that person. He actually had a consulting programmer from an external company "helping" him to create the keypair and the programmer had a backup. Ignorant users does not know to protect them selves.
Afterwards I realised that it is never possible to know if anyone have exclusive control over their key. You simply have to trust the other person.
And more: often it does not matter! That is: if my contact choose to share the key with an external consultant it is his choice. It is good if I know, but I cannot always know. I can still use the key for encryption to him, as long as he is willing to accept the key as his own.
But it does matter if I send something that I do not want to be read by ANYONE but the intended recipient. Then I must trust the recipient - otherwise he could print the document and give it away anyway.
By the way I read an article on how to implement PGP-encryption in a company. The author suggested that an administrator would create the keypairs for all users and sign them with a company signing key. Then he should distribute the keys to the users and keep a backup of the public key. "But the secret key should not be kept". What would prevent the administrator to keep the secret keys for any reson? How would you know how many people controls the secret key for a user you encrypt to?

I have re-read the document above today and realised that compressed data
e.g. zip-files might be a problem. The document tells that the attack
succeeds in 100% of the times if compression isn't used. And GPG doesn't
compress data if it already is compressed, right? And the mdc doesn't help
against this vulnerability?
BTW I found the switch --force-mdc that might be useful if not AES or
Twofish are used. Any problems with that? (I am testing it right now!)

Bad news Joe,
according to a discussion on the WinPT users list it is possible to
"harvest" e-mail addresses on a keyserver. Timo Scultz confirmed this, but
it has not happend so far as I know.
I can only think of one countermeasure:
I will not include alla my e-mailaddresses in the userid:s
I can anyhow tell people which key to use (and GPGrelay users can let
GPGrelay create aliases by the option "learn from POP": if a valid
signature is found I get a question if the from address should be a new
alias for an e-mail address found in the user-id of the used signing key.)

You need a front-end and I suggest you take a look att GPGrelay: It does automatic signing and encryption. And automatically verifies signed mail and decrypts encrypted mail.
You have to do the setup correct to get it working: it's a relay i.e. you have to pass the mail through the program. And you have to create groups of e-mailaddresses/keys with different signing/encryption policies.
You may do some key management, key generation, signing and encryption etc with GPGrelay as well. When the setup is done anyone can use it.
And it's quite stable nowdays ... v.0.92  And comes with an installer.

must be available for review, otherwise you don't know if the software is
secure. PGP is not opensorce but the source is available for "peer review"
and is thus judged as secure.
GPGShell has been more mature than WinPT for a long while and it's
extremely similar to PGP and thus easy to use. But I will never use it as
the source isn't available.

GPGrelay "hangs" occasionally when fetching mail. It might have something
to do with the option --outo-key-retreive ? What about a time-out for the

@_subject: Multiple sub-signingkeys 
Finally I hope that I have understood what Adrian von Bidder tells on his page about using multiple subkeys:
It is possible to use a "crippled" key without the secret primary signing key if an other secret signing key is present. Only the public primary signing key is needed. When listing the secret keys the primary key with missing secret key is market with "your primary secret key should be marked with a '
$ gpg --list-secret-key testuser
sec# 1024D/971B7A70 2003-01-03 testuser ssb  1024g/ACDF80C4 2003-01-03
ssb  1024R/BE9CA308 2003-01-07"
This crippled key can be used on an insecure computer, while your complete key can be used on a secure computer. When listing secret keys for the original key the primary key is shown without the You can thus easily see what secret keys are present in each keyring.
(If I am right it might be a good idea to emphasize this on your page, Adrian!)
I find Adrians advice very useful. Why isn't it easier to do it?
(I have tried to do it with WinPT and it works OK. But I cannot see what secret keys are present neither with WinPT, nor with GPGrelay.)
Have I missed something?

My answer is that it is important that a CA publishes the policy. Everyone
can then decide how much to trust the CA (that applies to the robot-CA as
well ...)
It might be useful with a CA with a restrictive policy: it might be more
trusted than other CA:s.
In fact it's the only reson not to have only robot-CA:s: i.e. a human CA
has the advantage to be able to perform complicated checks and have a
judgment of what to sign. Even a robot can deny to sign certain kinds of
keys ... ;-)

And you should send your key to a keyserver to let everybody know about the new signature.

NO, their signature is not included when you sign. It's added to the public key and is always visible, weather you sign something or not.

The receiver sets a trust according to first hand knowledge about your key or according to signatures from others he trusts. If the receiver hasn't put any trust into your key he will get a message like "there is nothing that implies that the key belongs to the owner".

I really love GPGrelay! It's simple to use after the initial setup of the relays, yet powerful. You can even do a lot of key administration with it. (More is to come, meanwhile you can use my simple tools on  )
GPGrelay is a step towards an encryption tool for everyone, but yet the setup is to hard for my Granny or my children. Still, if I set it up even very old or very young people can sign and encrypt.

Checking for malware can easily be done after decryption by any antivirus
scanner on the client. The resident scanner (monitor or what ever it is
called) stops the virus if it's known. Ordinary e-mail clients like e.g.
Eudora saves the attachment in an ordinary folder and thus the attachment
can easily be scanned by the antivirus.
If you use Outlook or Outlook Express you'd better use a virus scanner with
an e-mail module. It can easily be configured to scan mail after decryption
with e.g. GPGrelay: the mail first passes GPGrelay and then is scanned by
the antivirus module.
But: The virus scanner at the e-mail server cannot scan encrypted traffic,
as the original message stated. Unless using the commercial PGP:s feature ADK.
You can get extra security by using antivirusprotection that stops any
unknown code from running on the Windows client e.g. the Swedish Abtrusion
Protector (using SHA-1 checksums)  or the personal
firewall Tiny Personal Firewall (using md5 checksums)
 Abtrusion Protector is only for
WindowsXP.  Tiny's solution is a bit tricky to set up and configure, both
do use a lot of resources. (What you win in one end you loose in an other ...)

Hi again Thomas,
did you read my mail about stopping unknown software from running on the client? I believe it is a step forward that such software is available from at least 2 different developers. It's quite popular to use Abtrusion Protector to "lock" computers at Swedish schools. Wouldn't the same kind of solution be applicable at your company?

True, I'm waiting for the spammers to "tap" the key servers. It can be
done, that's why it will be done eventually. On this list there was a
discussion how to not put the "real" e-mail address in the UID of the
key, but rather a dummy e-mail address "changes

I would like to add the robot-CA protection i.e. the e-mail address
connected to the key. (The robot signs the key, encrypts it and sends
it to the e-mail addresses in the UID:s of the key. Only a person
having access to both the e-mail account and the secret key can use
the signatures.  )

The Swedish government is actively working for more use of free software in
the administration, mainly because MS Office licenses costs them to much.
They recently have made a public list of all Swedish companies offering any
kind of products or services related to free software.
I have offered support for GnuPG and related programs and for some other
free software through one of my businesses: Clipanish. Now I am on the
official list. I am waiting for orders and invitations to public tenders!
If I succeed I will a) have more time to spend on translations etc b)

I would like to add automatic use of robot-CA:s to the scheme. It's a
simple way of tieing a key to an e-mail address:
- - the user just generates a key
- - the client sends it to a robot-CA
- - the robot CA signs the key, encrypts it with the same key and returns it
to all e-mail addresses used in the userid.
- - the encrypted message from the robot-CA is received, decrypted, the
signed key is imported to the keyring and sent to at least one keyserver.
The rest as you proposed.

The details might have to be modified somewhat. I would personally prefer
to add some key verification by automatic use of robot-CA:s, as I have told
in previous discussions.
Anyhow it's important to work in the direction of a very easy to use tool
for users that are not interested in the technical matters. All projects
working in that direction are wellcome!
It would be fine if some teams would form that could try developing
extremely easy to use encryption software. I suppose in the end a winner
will evolve.
It might be the marketing that makes the winner rather than the technical
solution. Think of a successful software company with an unstable operative

Agree. Most people doesn't care. They even send strictly confidential

Fine. I asked all these questions because I suddenly realised that things
like e.g. choosing a safe algo is all in vane if someone easily can bypass
the encryption. By e.g. finding unencrypted keys or the encrypted file in

Ask them! I guess it has two advantages:

2) some people have easier to understand the hierarchical trust model. And they do trust Thawte :-) - I might be able to convince them to trust me too!

You can set GPGrelay to sign/encrypt the attachments inlined, but it is only recommended if the receiver cannot handle PGP-MIME.
PGP-MIME is far better but unfortunately PGP-MIME signed mail is not transparent to non-pgp users. They will be confused by the empty mail with the two strange attachments (though readable in a texteditor). Thus I cannot use PGP-MIME widely.
(S/MIME has an advantage as such signatures doesn't confuse users: the mail appears as usual in e.g. Outlook Express, only a fancy attachment is added.)

I have noticed many non-valid inlined signatures but I have never ran into
any problems with inlined encrypted (and signed) mail. Why? What's the
difference? Does the encryption somehow protect the original mail (so the
signature always will verify)? Can this knowledge be used to somehow
improve the inlined signatures?

NO, PGP-MIME looks really strange in Outlook Express. You'd better try it!
I cannot give up the OE-users as they are the mainpart of my customers.
Thus I have to stick to inlined pgp-signing (doesn't always verify OK) or
switch to S-MIME (rather not!).

Don't change or patch the code in that way!
You'd better not use any encryption that isn't OpenPGP compliant and further not compatible with GnuPG. If you do, you cannot expect anyone to be able to decrypt your files/messsages.
Besides, there isn't much need for a weaker key anyway.
So, stick to the default settings in GnuPG!

How large files where used in this performance test? I recently read a NIST evaluation: For 256-bit keys TWOFISH was slightly faster than AES on (very) large files.
BTW I've been told it isn't wise to encrypt files larger than a few MB using a block size of 64 bits. What's the limit for the block size 128 bits, used in the new AES and TWOFISH ciphers? And what's the problem?

It appears to apply to all block ciphers, but it should be "a few HUNDRED megabytes", according to what I found with Google:
"Blowfish has a 64 bit block size and a key length of anywhere from 32 bits to 448 bits. ... It should be noted that, like other block cyphers with a 64 bit block, it is risky to encrypt extremely large texts (more than a few hundred megabytes) with a single key. If more data is to be encrypted a block cipher with a larger block size should be used."

I was more concerned about encryption. What about the performance
AES-256 compared to TWOFISH for very large files with GPG? AES makes
more rounds for larger keys, TWOFISH does the same number of rounds
for all key lengths. That might make TWOFISH attractive for large

A Swedish cryptographer explained the issue to me yesterday. Further
he told me that the recommendation "not more than a few hundred
Megabytes" for was to have marginal against "bad luck".
On average 32 GB is the limit i.e. the probability is 50 % that an
adversary finds two identical blocks. But you might have bad luck and
he might find two identical blocks in somewhat smaller files.
He didn't tell me how to calculate the risk:
a) What is the risk (probability) if I encrypt a file of the size S
with the blocksize B?
and reversed:
b) If I want to set the risk to P and use the block size S, how large
files can I encrypt?

I am not a cryptographer, but I suppose it gives a hint to find the key. That's why certain encryption modes like ECB (electronic code book encryption) should not be used. With ECB all similar blocks will get the same encryption.

OpenPGP uses the encryption mode CFB , Werner Koch wrote recently. CFB is an encryption mode that turns a block cipher into a stream cipher ...

I didn't notice when I examined the key properties with WinPT or in

It might be a good idea to make GPG display a more helpful error message,

Yes, it's recommended in the PGP-manual to regularely change encryptions

Be sure to use a symmetric crypto algo with 128-bit block size to encrypt that large files because of the "birthday paradox". Otherwise the probability of finding two identical blocks in the encrypted file is too large, se previous discussion "twofish keysize", "Blocksize versus file size" and "block-cipher weakness?".
Use AES, AES192, AES256 or TWOFISH. If you would like a large key size TWOFISH is faster than AES256. AES is faster than TWOFISH, because TWOFISH is always used with a 256 bit key. I haven't compared AES192 and TWOFISH but they would probably perform similarly.

I have learned that message protection (mdc) is not used by default when
using symmetric encryption (password encryption). I can verify this when
the default cipher CAST is used: The warning "Message was not integrity
protected" is displayed upon decryption.
What puzzles me is that this warning is not displayed if I specify the
cipher to AES. Is integrity protection always used with some ciphers?
Are there any drawbacks if I specify "force-mdc" in my gpg.conf-file?
Is it possible to change the default cipher for symmetric encryption?

personal-cipher-preferences doesn't work with WinPT, only if I use GPG

I write e.g. personal-cipher-preferences s7 in the config-file,
but it doesn't prevent WinPT from using CAST-5.
If I use:
gpg --symmetric file
it works alright. Is this an issue with GPG-ME or with WinPT?
BTW force-mdc works OK with WinPT.

Hash: SHA1
how is symmetric encryption performed in GnuPG? When encrypting the secret
key and when encrypting a file?
I suppose a session key is created with the chosen length (depending on the
chosen cipher). And the session key is encrypted with the passphrase.
How is the passphrase used? Is it hashed with e.g. SHA-1 to derive a key?
Or is the passphrase used directly?
What are the security implications? It cannot be meaningful to choose a
cipher that produces a longer key than the password can generate. If SHA-1
is the limit, then you've got 160 bits. Thus a cipher with 256 bits would
be overkill. If the password is used directly the calculation must be based
on the strength of the password used by the individual, I suppose.

I thought once more about this :-)
It's hard enough to put up a passphrase that matches an 128 bit-key. The
hash, if any, doesn't matter, because it can hardly decrease the strength
of the passphrase,.
Thus any cipher with a key longer than 128-bits is overkill when you
encrypt symmetrically. Right?

In that case it's important to know how the session key for symmetric encryption is derived from the passphrase. If hashing with SHA-1 i used that will set the limit to 160 bits.
In that case AES192 would be appropriate - only 32 bits wasted :-). AES256 or TWOFISH would be ridiculous, wouldn't it?

As far as I can understand the key used for symmetric encryption is
derived from the
user supplied passphrase by hashing it (+ salting and maybe iterating
it). Thus the hash sets the limit. I suppose SHA-1 is used. Then we
will have 160 true bits. A key-length of e.g. 256 bits would be

@_subject: Encryption algos 
Hash: SHA1
I just checked the list of algos in GnuPG v. 1.4:
3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH
The list is rather long, what about making it a bit longer?
Rational: When AES starts to become questioned (10 years from now? sooner?)
we have an  other secure algo to fall back upon.
We have got basically two modern algos: AES and TWOFISH. Both are created
with an emphasis on speed, rather than on security. What about including an
algo with emphasis on security? I can see at least two suitable algos among
the AES-candidates:
Serpent (2:nd best to Rijndael=AES in the final evaluation round)
CAST256 (beaten by Serpent in the first evaluation round)
CAST256 is an improved version of CAST5 and might be a natural choice for
OpenPGP. I don't know if the algo is used in any software or if it is
studied by cryptographers any more. It might not be a good idea to include
a cipher that isn't well studied (cf TWOFISH!).
Serpent is considered secure due to "a conservative design" and many
rounds. I think it is used in some software. This cipher might be of more
interest to cryptographers and thus might be well studied. The drawback
might be that the design is somewhat similar to Rijndael=AES and thus can
be attacked in similar ways.
Any way. There isn't any need to hurry. Better make a wise decision (cf

I will answer my own question:
Diceware contains 7776 short English words, abbreviations and
easy-to-remember character strings.
If you use 1 language:
log2(7776)=log(7776)/log(2)=3,8908/0,3010=12,92 bits
128/12,92=9,9 words = 10 words
If you use 2 languages:
log2(2*7776)=log(15552)/log(2)=4,1918/0,3010=13,92 bits
128/13,92=9,9 words = 10 words
If you use 3 languages:
log2(3*7776)=log(23328)/log(2)=4,3679/0,3010=14,51 bits
128/14,51=8,8 words = 9 words
If you use 4 languages:
log2(4*7776)=log(31104)/log(2)=4,4928/0,3010=14,92 bits
128/14,92=8,6 words = 9 words
If you use 5 languages:
log2(5*7776)=log(38880)/log(2)=4,5897/0,3010=15,25 bits
128/15,25=8,4 words = 9 words
Three languages and 9 words is the optimal choice.
The creator of Diceware suggest a password corresponding to only 64
bits as a practical choice:
"Of course, if you are worried about an organization that can break a
word passphrase in order to read your e-mail, there are a number of
issues you should be concerned with -- such as how well you pay the
team of
armed guards that are protecting your computer 24 hours a day."
64 bits would give (after correcting calculations):
10 random characters including special characters.
11 random CAPS, small characters (a-z) and numbers (0-9).
13 random small characters (a-z) and numbers (0-9).
14 random small characters (a-z).
20 random numbers (0-9).
5 random Diceware-word (one language)
An English phrase with 54 words.
That's a convenient guide, isn't it!

I suggest that you use , and . instead of # and $. Otherwise the characters

True, but it might be convenient anyhow. The shorter the time, the safer
the guess!
One way is to assume that the key is attacked immediately and that all the
security is in the passphrase. Make an estimation of the strength of the
passphrase and you are done!
Issuers of X509 certificates use 1 year for soft certificates and 5 years
for card certificates. I don't know their calculations behind that decision.

There you told something interesting. I haven't heard of that command
A new user has to quickly download keys to his contacts. The keys are
signed by a mutually trusted CA.
How can he get valid keys to use trusting the CA, rather than having

Yes, David, you are right. I want a bit more.
Some contacts may not be directly signed by the CA, then the trust
model will be important, I suppose. How can the signature of the CA be
useful as far down the tree as possible?
Can you please explain the PGP-model and how to issue trust signatures

Hi again David,
now I tried:
1. Creating one Root-CA, signing a CA-key by:
gpg --edit-key keyid
with 2 = I trust fully
  depth = 2
2. Letting a "user key" sign the Root-CA-key with
with 2 = I trust fully
  depth = 2
Keys signed by the CA-key are valid for the user.
Please explain the depth i detail.
A. Would it be sufficient to choose depth = 1 for both trust
signatures above?
B. What happens if a key signed by the CA signs an other key with an
ordinary exportable signature?
C Why choose depth = 2? A scenario?

Hash: SHA1
I would like to have only a signing key on my OpenPGP Card. (I find an RSA
encryption key of 1024 bits ridiculously short.)
The generate command generated three keys. I edited the key and deleted the
encryption key, fine. But after that everything went bad:
WinPT file manager lets me encrypt to the key! So the encryption key is
still present somehow.
I got "Unusable keyring" when I tried to sign with EudoraGPG.
gpg --card-status gave some strange error messages.
Is the only way to create a signing key on a secure computer and import it
to the card?
What can I do to reset the card?

@_subject: Timing attack against AES 
Bruce Schneier presented in his blog a few days ago a new attack against AES made by Daniel J. Bernstein.
Schneier's blog "AES Timing Attack":
Bernstein's paper: "Cache timing attacks on AES":
In short Bernstein has shown that:
a) AES is very susceptible to timing attacks, contrary to what was stated in the AES evaluation process. In the AES evaluation process the evaluators made an erroneously statement: "Table lookup: not vulnerable to timing attacks". This lead to the conclusion that Rindael (now AES) had an advantage to it's competitors in this area.
b) A simple attack is performed successfully against the OpenSSL implementation of AES. The success is blamed on the design of AES.
c) The problem is that certain operations are not made at a constant time, rather they are dependent on the input etc. This opens to timing attacks.
d) The attack was performed against a server with a Pentium III CPU and a known plaintext. He outlines attacks agains other processors and other implementations of AES.
e) The attack can be improved in several ways and be made on other "leaks" if this one is mended: "it is extremely difficult to write "Constant-time high-speed AES software for general purpose computers". Constant-time = independent of the key and input.
f) The problem is the heavy dependence on S-boxes.
g) It is easy to write slow constant-time software that is immune to this kind of attacks. He makes a demonstration. AES would be extremely slow.
My questions:
1) Has anyone looked at the AES implementation in GnuPG in this aspect?
2) Are any other ciphers safer to this kind of attack? What about the ciphers in OpenPGP applications? Other AES candidates?
3) Would it be easier to write a fast implementation of some other cipher that is immune to this kind of timing attacks?
4) What are the plans for GnuPG?

@_subject: Show digest-algo at signature checking 
Hash: SHA1
today when SHA-1 is questioned and some people use other digest-algos like
RIPEMD160 or even SHA256 it would be appropriate if the digest algo was
displayed when I check a signature. I haven't find any way to do this with
detached signatures or inlined signatures.

Thank you for your very thorough answer! I am a windows user and do a lot of backups etc with gnupg. I have so far only managed to make some batch files that simplify my daily work - scripting has been unsuccessful.
I have interpreted Werners answer this way:
1) Use an archiver as a temporary solution. (I can always store the encrypted file, that is without compression, and add the date and time to the output file.)
2) This important feature is not for GnuPG, but it can be implemented in frontends for Windows. I have so far suggested it to GPGee (the Explorer extensions). It could just as well be implemented in other frontends, like My recent hope is that the very nice GPGee will make some of my batch files Per Tunedal

@_subject: RSA encrypt och sign key 
Hash: SHA1
is there any drawback using an RSA encrypt och sign key?
If I only have a single key there isn't any problem to tie an encryption
key to the signature key; it's the same key. This would be fine in these
days when hash-algos are falling around us.
Of course the self signature is still a problem, but the problems would
still be smaller when SHA-1 falls.

@_subject: passphrase or random characters the safest 
Hash: SHA1
I once again ponder over wether a passphrase is safer than a string of
random characters.
It's easy to compute the strength of a random string  of characters. About
20 - 25 characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and special characters) would correspond
to a 128-bit symmetric key.
But what about a passphrase. Many people argue that a random looking
password of the initials in a passphrase is fairly safe:  Byu!IAiw?Tai42 .
But it could be attacked with a dictionary attack, "because it comes from
real words". How safe is it then?
A plain text sentence would be worse, because it would be more easily
attacked, some people argue.
But I read a discussion about TrueCrypt and someone argued:
"You could create a "real sentence" from ANY randomly generated password,
since any letter in the password could be the first letter of literally
*thousands* of words. So how could a dictionary attack differentiate
between the password mentioned above, and a truely random one?"
I would argue that:
1.  Five (5) random words would be safer than a random string of 20
characters. There are far more words than there are characters. The entropy
for each word would be about 12.9 bits according to the diceware page
 . A character would have an entropy of 1.9.
2. In an ordinary sentence, each word would have an entropy of 1-1.4 bits.
If we set the entropy to 1.2 we would need approximately 38.53/1.2 words =
32 Words, if the entropy is 1.4 only 27 words!
Why so many words? Because words are easy to guess with help of the context.
A passphrase of 10 words would be OK if the entropy was 3.9 - it must seem
fairly random then. An entropy of 7.7 would make 5 words sufficient.
I prefer passphrases because they are easier to remember than 20 random
characters. True random words are slightly harder to remember than a phrase.
How to make a short passphrase look random enough?
How can I compute the strength (entropy)?
Is experiments with live persons guessing passphrases the only way to
compute the strength? Do you know of any such experiment? Or can you set up
one at your university? It would be very interesting to compare different
strategies of randomising the passphrase.

Thank you Oskar for this idea - it's new to me. Increasing the search space
by using several languages is a very easy way to improve the security of a
passphrase or a collection of random words. Some one who wants to do some
calculations? What about say 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 languages. How many random
words are needed to match a 128 bit key?
