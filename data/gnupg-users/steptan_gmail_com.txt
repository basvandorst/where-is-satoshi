@_subject: command-line gpg not working 
First, let me say that
Both exist and both seem to work.
When I run from the command line
gpg2 --gen-key
Everything goes fine until the passphrase step, where the program skips
ahead and errors:
Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.
gpg: problem with the agent: No pinentry
gpg: Key generation canceled.
This process launches gpg-agent --daemon on its own. So I tried killing
gpg-agent --daemon --use-standard-socket
launching my own:
gpg-agent --daemon --pinentry-program=/bin/pinentry
But the behavior is the same.
OS: linux, Fedora 18
# gpg2 --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.19
libgcrypt 1.5.0
# gpg-agent --version
gpg-agent (GnuPG) 2.0.19
libgcrypt 1.5.0
