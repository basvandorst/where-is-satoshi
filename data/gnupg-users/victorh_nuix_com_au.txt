@_subject: gpgme licensing 
Hi list,
I am new to GPG and having a look around. I downloaded GPGME and had a look on the licensing. I wonder why it is GPLed instead of LGPLed. I admit I'm new in GPG and perhaps missed out the discussion on this issue. Is there any reason why it is  GPLed? I'm looking for a solution for PGP for a client system, sadly because GPGME is gpled I might have to find something else.
That's all I hope I didn't offend anyone by asking this licensing issue, I know this can be quite a sensitive issue for some people.
