The PGP GUI in freeware mode should continue working. The paid elements include
the email plugins and PGPdisk.
It is fairly easy to import your entire keyring set to GnuPG
The above works at this time (PGP 9.x and GnuPG 1.4). It will quire possibly
change at some future date. The canonical method is to export the keys from PGP
and import them into GnuPG. Adding '--import-options import-local-sigs' to the
command line will import local signatures.

@_subject: keyserver traffic hijacking? 
============================== START ==============================
Well, what's the problem? There's no 'hijacking' involved -
Kim-Minh's server is usually in the pool, as is mine.
1) pool.sks-keyservers.net is *not* some single machine. It is a collection of
20 server addresses chosen at random from a pool of 30-34 well-connected servers
which is updated twice per day. (See [1])
Because of the way SKS operates, you should consider any and all servers in
pool.sks-keyservers.net to be equivalent, use the pool DNS A record and not
worry about which individual server your OS' resolver code returns to you.
2) Typing  or, for that matter, http:// into a browser will fail a healthy percentage of the time. The
failure is not the fault of the keyserver. Of the 37 SKS servers detailed at
Peter Pramberger's SKS Status page[2], only 14 listen on port 80 in addition to
listening on the SKS default port of 11371.
FWIW, there is no requirement that a SKS server provide an human readable web
page. Most do, but it's not required. If you're set on accessing a server web
page, you must specify the port as well as the specific server, not the
collection name, [1] [2]

@_subject: GPG Home Directory 
Not telling us your overall goal in changing from the defaults is usually the
first part of that answer - it requires responders to divine your intentions
(I'm low on tea leaves and n00b entrails aren't as easy to obtain as they used
to be).
Using --homedir will require that you specify it each and every time you issue a
gpg command.
Alternatively, you could leave gpg.conf in %APPDATA%\GnuPG and redirect GnuPG to
the alternate location for the keyring and trustdb files. (This is the approach
I use with removable media and IMHO the most sensible.)
Just for reference, here's a relevant chunk of docs\README.W32 (README-W32.txt)
which the installer includes with the binaries:
  Home directory:
  ===============
  GnuPG makes use of a per user home directory to store its keys as well
  as configuration files.  The default home directory is a directory
  named "gnupg" below the application data directory of the user.  This
  directory will be created if it does not exist.  Being only a default,
  it may be changed by setting the name of the home directory into the
  Registry under the key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\GnuPG using the
  name "HomeDir".  If an environment variable "GNUPGHOME" exists, this
  even overrides the registry setting.  The command line option
  "--homedir" may be used to override all other settings of the home
  directory.
and the file NEWS (docs\NEWS.txt) in the section for 1.4.1 gives the search
  * [W32] The algorithm for the default home directory changed:
    First we look at the environment variable GNUPGHOME, if this one
    is not set, we check whether the registry entry
    {HKCU,HKLM}\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir has been set. If this
    fails we use a GnuPG directory below the standard application
    data directory (APPDATA) of the current user. Only in the case
    that this directory cannot be determined, the old default of
    c:\gnupg will be used.  The option --homedir still overrides all
    of them.
So to use C:\GNUPG, you may (select one)
  a) set a user-level environment variable, GNUPGHOME
  b) edit the registry value HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir
  c) edit the registry to remove any reference to Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir
     in both HKCU and HKLM. It looks like you might need to also remove the
     %APPDATA%\GnuPG directory. Praying the fall through logic never changes
     would probably also be beneficial.
There's not a lot to gain from using C:\GNUPG which is one of the reasons it was
changed for the installer. Ditto the executables in \Program Files\Gnu\GnuPG.
There is, however, an amount to say against using it, especially on a multiuser

The bad passphrase error points to your passphrase file being at fault. Check
that your passphrase file is the same exact length as the passphrase.
Use DIR at a command prompt or any program that will do a hex dump for you.
A  (hex 0x0d0a) at the end of the passphrase in the file will cause the
passphrase to fail.  (0x0a) alone seems to work as well as no line ending at
notepad can be used to create the file without line endings.
These problems go away by removing the passphrase from the key. And remove the

Yep. You've been told already: quoted printable.
Last two lines. Recall in base=64, '=' is only allowed as null filler,
so at the end of the message there shouldn't be anything after the '='.
Ditto the CRC being an extra two characters too long, should only be five.
Quoted printable uses a two digit hex value prefixed with '='.
0x3D = '=' = '=3D'
s/=3D/=/ and it should decrypt.
Quoted printable should have been specified in the messages' MIME headers.
TB on OS X is interpreting the '=3D' correctly and changing it back to
'=' before passing to Enigmail and GnuPG.
It would appear to be a Ubuntu bug.
The q-p encoding of '=' is also what is keeping it from decrypting on

Short answer: You can't.
Digital Certificates are X.509. You are using OpenPGP.
X.509 is the native encryption builtin to web browsers and email apps such as
Outlook and Thunderbird (S/MIME).
OpenPGP and X.509 are similar in some respects but mostly incompatible. You
cannot mix X.509 and OpenPGP in the same mail message. Nor can each make use of
the other's keys/certificates.

Well, sort of. That section of the interview is talking about Twofish wrt folks

Q: A rough count from the list on your Web site indicates that there are well
   over 150 software products (including the mainline Linux kernel, from
   v2.5.47) that use Blowfish. Has it exceeded or met your expectations?
A: I don't know if I had any expectations. There weren't enough alternatives to
   DES out there. I wrote Blowfish as such an alternative, but I didn't even
   know if it would survive a year of cryptanalysis. Writing encryption
   algorithms is hard, and it's always amazing if one you write actually turns
   out to be secure. At this point, though, I'm amazed it's still being used. If
   people ask, I recommend Twofish instead.
Don't see any mention of AES.
Also, you may wish to consider that on page four of that interview, when asked
about a 3rd edition of /Applied Cryptography/[1], Schneier responds:
   "However, in a way there is now a sequel. Practical Cryptography[2], by
   Neils Ferguson and myself, was published this year. It's about
   cryptography as it is used in real-world systems, about cryptography
   as an engineering discipline rather than cryptography as a mathematical
   science.
   "This is the book we wish we'd had more than a decade ago when we
   started our cryptographic careers. It collects our combined experiences
   on how to design cryptographic systems the right way. In some ways, this
   book is a sequel to Applied Cryptography, but it focuses on very practical
   problems and on how to build a secure system rather than just design a
   cryptographic protocol.
And in /Applied Cryptography/, they write[3]:
   4.5.7 Which Block Cipher Should I Choose
  "/That/ is the question. Don't forget that we are biased because we were part
of the team that designed Twofish. We also spent quite a lot of time attacking
the other AES finalist, which further influences our point of view.
  "The safe choice for your career is AES. This is the official standard,
sanctioned by the U.S. government. Everybody else will be using it, too. We do
not think it is the absolute safest choice for your data, but if there is ever a
successful attack against AES, it obviously won't be your fault. They used to
say "nobody gets fired for buying IBM." Similarly, nobody will fire you for
choosing AES. As long as it isn't you who loses money and/or sleep if AES gets
broken, choose AES.
  "AES has other advantages. It is relatively easy to use and implement. All
cryptographic libraries support it, and all customers like it as it is "the
standard." In this sense, you cannot go wrong with AES.
  "If you are paranoid about the security of your data, and speed is not that
important, then you should choose Serpent. During the AES process, every serious
cryptographer agreed that Serpent was the most secure (or most conservative) of
all the submissions.
  "That does not leave a lot of room for Twofish. You should only choose Twofish
if you want the speed of AES without the security disadvantages listed above. Of
course, all the institutional advantages of AES will now weigh against you. If
Twofish is ever broken, you will be blamed for selecting it.
  "There are probably circumstances in which 3DES still is the best solution. If
you have to be backward compatible, or are locked into a 64-bit block size by
other parts of the system, then 3DES is still your best choice...

@_subject: signing documents and others 
Sort of. OpenOffice (Acrobat, and other applications) use X.509 certificates to
sign.  GPGEE's contect menu uses OpenPGP keys as I recall. The two are similar
in mechanics but are not interoperable.
A signature verifies that the file received is the same as the file that was
signed. Whether or not, the sender actually did the signing or sent that exact
file is another discussion.
Free certificates are available from Thawte (even though they were bought by
VeriSlime); as well as CACert and TC TrustCenter GmbH.
Thawte and CACert have programs in place to create a network of assurers who can
verify identity beyond the basic Class 1 level.
The Windows "system" of validating a signature is the same as the Browser's -
it's defined by the standard. Yes, the new cert's will go into "Personal" as you
will have the secret key to enable your t sign things.
See section  of the next question
everyone does this differently. Here's what I do.
1) Backup the keyring files.
You're on Windows, so your keyring files are located, by default, in
%APPDATA%\GnuPG. On english systems, APPDATA expands to
"C:\Documents and Settings\\Application Data\". Copy al three *.gpg
files to your backup media (PCMCIA flash, USB, CF, SD, ZIP, etc...)
I use subdirectories for X.509 certs, GnuPG keys, and PGP key rings.
2) Export your keypair.
On Windows, I use GPGshell. Launch GPGkeys, select the key and choose Export
from the pull-down or context menu. You'll be prompted for a location to store
the public key, choose your backup location. Then you'll be asked if you wish to
export your secret key, click OK and again choose your backup location.
GPGshell will create armored keys with the name
" () pub.asc" and " () sec.asc"
3) make a backup of the backup on a *different* media type.
This is when I burn things to s credit card CD.
4) Securely store each backup in a *different* location.
at a command prompt:
    gpg --edit-key 0xdecafbad adduid
Supply your Real Name, Email Address, and any Comment. If it looks fine, enter O
for Okay. You'll then be asked for your passphrase to generate a self-signature
for that ID.
gpg will then display a list of IDs on the key. If you wish the new UID to be
primary, enter its number to select it, then the command 'primary' followed byu
the command 'save'. Now update the keyserver copy:
    gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-key 0xdecafbad
Not an idiot at all. Quite decent questions.

That is correct, by design keyservers are merge only. It prevents
attacks on the keys stored on keyservers such as removing revocations.
You can remove any cruft you wish and distribute that key yourself. You
just can't use the keyserver networks to do it. Also anyone who
refreshes that key from a keyserver will pick up all the pieces you
decided needed deleting.

Normally within a hour or two.  The SKS keyservers use a very fast and
efficient protocol to exchange updates. Updates are emailed to other
keyservers running different software packages as well as the older PKS
servers to try and keep them updated.
The pool is best, hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net
Good SKS status pages are:
        Keyserver web pages listen on port 11371, so one needs to add the port
to the browser URL:
    About 1/2 of the SKS servers also listen on port 80, the default http
port, for users behind restrictive firewalls.  There's even an email
protocol for user behind REALLY restrictive firewalls. Peter
Pramberger's status page indicates which servers have these capabilities.
There are presently eight or so servers supporting IPv6. That should

If a valid key can be located for each recipient, the message will be
encrypted to all. If a single recipient cannot be matched with a key,
the message will be sent in the clear.
The message will be encrypted once with a symmetric cipher and session
key. Then the session key is encrypted to each recipient's public key
and the encrypted session keys are attached to the message.
For each recipient the first valid key with matching email address is
the one selected. If this is not the preferred key, then Enigmail's
Per-recipient rules may be setup to specify the correct key to use.

Enigmail passes GnuPG a list of recipients to encrypt to. It does not
generate separate messages, only the one.  This is a constraint of
Thunderbird's architecture.
BCCed recipients are treated as just another recipient. There is only
one copy of the message and one set of encrypted session keys.
If one is going to encrypt *and, at the same time*, use BCC, he should
seriously look at using GnuPG's throw-keyids option. From the man page:
    --throw-keyids
    --no-throw-keyids
         Do not put the recipient key  IDs  into  encrypted  messages.
         This helps to hide the receivers of the message and is a lim-
         ited countermeasure against traffic analysis.  On the receiv-
         ing side, it may slow down the decryption process because all
         available secret keys must be tried.  --no-throw-keyids  dis-
         ables  this  option.   This option is essentially the same as
         using --hidden-recipient for all recipients.
The other alternative is to manually manage BCC copies. Personally, I'm
not a big fan of BCC.

Please QUIT installing add-ons until the program is working. You won't fix it by

It sounds like your system is still finding the GPG4win binaries first.
You may verify that by opening a command window (Start->Run-> cmd.exe click OK)
then enter the command
    gpg --version
The first line of output should either specify 1.4.7 if the GPG4win code is
found first, 1.4.9 otherwise. If it's 1.4.7, enter the command
    path
That will display the value of the PATH environment variable.
C:\Program Files\Gnu\GnuPG\pub will likely occur before
C:\Program Files\Gnu\GnuPG. That's what is causing your problem.
To fix it, you may either edit the PATH value (Control Panel -> System ->
Advanced -> Environment Variables)
Perhaps the easiest would be to run both the GnuPG for Windows (GPG4Win) and
GnuPG uninstallers. Then delete any files remaining in
C:\Program Files\Gnu\GnuPG. Re-run the gnupg-w32cli-1.4.9.exe installer.
Open a fresh command window and give the command 'gpg --version' again. It
should report 1.4.9 as the version.

Quoting myself from this list, 13-Oct-2005:
    PKS does not handle V4 key features well. Notable examples of mangled
    features are multiple subkeys, a revoked subkey (tag 0x28), duplicate
    keyids, direct key signatures (tag 0x1F), revocation signatures on userids
    (tag 0x30), or photo IDs. There is also no development or maintenance being
    done on the pks platform.

@_author: John Clizbe 
@_subject: GNUPG and PKI compatibility (?) 
An "interesting" assortment, but the only one I'd keep is pool.sks-keyservers.net.
Here's why:
subkeys.pgp.net: The original purpose of subkeys.pgp.net was to be a set of
subkey safe keyservers, PKS servers that were patched to not mangle V4 keys and
a few of the new SKS servers. Most all maintained PKS boxes have converted to SKS.
The current collection is a subset of the SKS network: sks.gpg.cz,
keys.nayr.net, keyserver.ganneff.de, keyserver.maluska.de, keys.cardboard.net,
and  keys.keysigning.org. pool.sks-keyservers.net gives me all of these servers
and more. BTW, this is also a DNS round robin... you get a random server of the
six. Any of these are likely to be included in pool.sks-keyservers.net.
keys.nayr.net: It is, in general, very poor netiquette to steer traffic to a
single server when load-balancing mechanisms are well-known and available. The
more widely distributed that traffic balancing is, the better for all concerned.
If, for some reason, that single server is down, a user's keyserver operation
will fail. The pooled round-robins minimize this risk. This server is also part
of subkeys.pgp.net and ~50% likely to be part of pool.sks-keyservers.net.
pool.sks-keyservers.net: The *BEST*CHOICE* of this bunch. it is a DNS
round-robin consisting of 20 SKS servers that a) are up, and b) are synchronized
with the rest of the SKS network. 20 randomly chosen from 40-50 that normally
make up the greater pool of SKS servers and the list is updated twice per day.
The win is the b) part - because of the manner changes are distributed in the
SKS network, all servers have nearly or soon to be (within minutes) identical
copies of the entire database. I find that most times, my keyserver's 25+ recon
partners have zero differences from my copy of the database. Said another way,
outside of networking issues such as RTT (round trip time),
Sharing the load among all servers is the best approach for all - server
operators and users.
pgp.mit.edu: Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad idea. Perennial favorite for worst
recommendation of keyserver.
As a friend of mine said on this list two days ago, "Friends don't let friends
use pgp.mit.edu.  It is irreparably broken for modern OpenPGP keys."
"How is it broken?" you may ask. PKS does not handle V4 key features well.
Notable examples of mangled features are multiple subkeys, a revoked subkey (tag
0x28), duplicate keyids, direct key signatures (tag 0x1F), revocation signatures
on userids (tag 0x30), or photo IDs.
There is also no development or maintenance being done on the PKS platform.
Please do not recommend this server.
Your chances of a server not being up increase as the size of your pool of
servers decrease. Single server -> greatest odds of hitting a failure.
If they're listed as part of pool.sks-keyservers.net, they will most likely be
up (or were up within the last 12 hours or so)
Note: this list looks like a selection of keyserver directives from a GnuPG
configuration file, gpg.conf. Unless David or Werner changed the logic and I
missed the commit, only the last uncommented keyserver directive will be used by
GnuPG. There is no iteration over a list of keyservers al? PGP. You get one
active keyserver statement, hence pool.sks-keyservers.net being the best

The passphrase is the defense to keep a secret key safe. There are no recovery

It's been said on this list countless times, there is _absolutely_ no way to
recover anything in OpenPGP without the passphrase.

Generate new key? Yes.
Retrieve anything encrypted to old key? NO.
Everything encrypted to the old key is _ONLY_ retrievable with the old key
(or any other key it may be encrypted to)
Revoking a key flags it to others as no longer valid. If you do not have the
passphrase, you cannot revoke a key unless a revocation certificate was
previously generated and stored away in the event of a mishap such as this.
Sorry, but the revocation certificate suggestion does nothing to help you
retrieve things encrypted to the key with the lost passphrase.

Sort of... maybe. For PGP/MIME it is necessary to know the hash used when

Enigmail fixed this some time ago by first signing and examining a small test

@_subject: Security Concern: Unsigned Windows Executable 
What's Win-GnuPG? Are you referring to the windows installer build of
GnuPG from  as such? It's just GnuPG.
I believe the Windows signed .EXE format is X.509 cert based and as such
isn't going to help much if the signing certificate doesn't chain back
to Windows set of root certs. COTS products will probably invest the
money to implement this, it's unlikely for F/OSS. It also assumes the
Microsoft technology to create Authenticode signatures is available to
F/OSS developers.
Your MITM scenarios leave out the crucial step of your attacker also
needing to possess Werner Koch's signing key. The .SIG is not just a
checksum, it is a digital signature. The verification looks like this:
    $ gpg -v gnupg-w32cli-1.4.9.exe.sig
    gpg: assuming signed data in `gnupg-w32cli-1.4.9.exe'
    gpg: Signature made 03/26/08 12:51:54 using RSA key ID 1CE0C630
    gpg: using PGP trust model
    gpg: Good signature from "Werner Koch (dist sig) "
    gpg: binary signature, digest algorithm SHA1
Your  comment is confusing. There is no .SIG to download if verifying
with sha1sum. You run sha1sum against the file you wish to verify and
compare the program output with the published value.
Are you proposing some MITM attack of a replaced installer executable
with an /identical/ SHA-1 value?
sha1sum and md5sum are widely available as source.  If you're so
committed to this verified and signed thing that you're unwilling to
trust anything, you probably should look into building some things of
your own.
sha1sum is available as source and/or windows executable along  with the
respective digital signatures from ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/
Sooner or later you have to establish a base trust.
OH! Maybe you could use an eval version of PGP to verify the
cryptographic signature on the GnuPG installer. Of course that probably
hinges on its installer being a Windows signed-executable right? ;-)

Current development snapshots of what will be 1.4.10 may be built for
use on Windows, but it should be noted that this is an advanced activity
for most Windows users.
The officially supported environment is a POSIX-based cross-compile,
though Windows-based Cygwin is possible as well MSYS/MinGW which targets
a native win32 api. This is the same approach as the cross-compile.
Cygwin uses a compatibility layer.
If you intend to build GnuPG for the Win32 platform using MinGW, we
suggest reading the instructions titled " Building GnuPG for Win32 using
MinGW " written by Carlo Luciano Bianco. The binary we distribute has
been built using Debian's mingw32 cross compiler package .

This is being heavily discussed over on the [Cryptography] list (Judge

    The judge doesn't "need" to know the difference to beyond any
    doubt. If the judge thinks you're holding out, you go to jail for
    contempt.
    Geeks expect, far too frequently, that courts operate like Turing
    machines, literally interpreting the laws and accepting the
    slightest legal "hack" unconditionally without human consideration
    of the impact of the interpretation. This is not remotely the case.
    I'll repeat: the law is not like a computer program. Courts operate
    on reasonableness standards and such, not on literal interpretation
    of the law. If it is obvious to you and me that a disk has multiple
    encrypted views, then you can't expect that a court will not be able
    to understand this and take appropriate action, like putting you in
    a cage.
This is also a VERY narrowly defined decision, based on what the
defendant already showed ICE (US Customs) officers at the border.

@_subject: recieving/updating Public Keys from SKS keyserver to pubring.gpg 
Public key of sender is needed to verify his signature OR to encrypt
messages sent to him.
True, but there are easier solutions
Nope, that won't do it. --recv-key takes one of more hex key IDs.
--search-key will work with part of an address, but it is a manual
process. There's still an easier way to do this
gpg --refresh-keys on a periodic basis, cron job or Scheduled Tasks on
Not any mechanism within SKS for this directly, although... SKS'
mailsync mechanism could be used to forward updates to an all-employees
list, but the volume would probably get to be a nuisance. Doable but not
a good approach
auto-key-locate is more of a last-minute fetch, as such, it can be a bit
of a gamble
Since this is all happening within the context of a single enterprise,
what we have here is a system administration/HR issue. IMNSHO, the
intelligent thing to do in this implementation would be yo keep a
separate globally readable keyring of all the employee's keys (they need
not be current)
For each new employee, the employee:
1) generates a key and sends the pub key to the ring admin and the
   keyserver, and generates a revocation certificate, a copy of which
   stays with HR (alternatively, designate HR as a revoker)
2) The employee then imports the company pubring, thus obtaining all of
   the base keys
3) Then Employee then issues gpg --refresh-keys thus updating all keys
   to their current status
This global keyring doesn't even need to be binary, it can be a
concatenation of .asc exported keys
This scenario, along with ADKs, is part of what prompted PGP Corp to
create their PGP Enterprise offering.
If I was implementing this, I would not bother with running a private
SKS server for keys, it's serious overkill -- it's akin to using a
bazooka instead of a fly-swatter. (Note: I run a SKS keyserver.)
I'd use LDAP to serve keys as part of an enterprise wide directory
system.  Much, much, much more cleaner, easier, and more multipurpose of
a solution.
Honestly, you want LDAP. Really.

@_subject: where is the keyring location in windows XP 
The keyring files, pubring.gpg, secring.gpg, trustdb.gpg, are stored by
default in %APPDATA%\GnuPG. This usually translates as
 - Window XP and earlier (XP/2000/NT) -
    C:\Documents and Settings\\Application Data\GnuPG
 - Windows Vista and Windows 7:

Any custom settings for GnuPG are stored in gpg.conf. It and any other
GnuPG config files are /normally/ located in the same directory as the
keyring files.

If, as I suspect, it's dealing with trusting the key your encrypting to, either
sign the key with a local sig or use '--trust-model always'.

@_subject: multiple subkeys and key transition 
If one is still using keys of the old signing default of DSA/1024, a 160-bit
hash is the only choice available. That's dictated by the standard. But there's
no pressing need to generate a new key -- one can just switch to using
RIPEMD-160 instead of SHA-1. The fire alarm for SHA-1 has gone off and it's time
to move safely and calmly to the exits.  It's not worth panicking over, but
folks should have a transition plan in place. For my own use, I waited until I
had obtained a v2 OpenPGP card, the earlier v1 cards were limited to 1024 bit
RSA and only the two stock 160 bit hashes, SHA-1 and RIPMED-160.
Or one can use enable-dsa2 in GnuPG and use any of the SHA2 hashes, they'll just
be truncated down to 160 bits similarly to the SHA-224/SHA-256 arrangement
described below.
The best statement on keeping SHA-1 in use I've read comes from NIST:
   "SHA-1 has recently been demonstrated to provide less than 80 bits of
    security for digital signatures; at the publication of this Recommendation,
    the security strength against collisions is assessed at 69 bits. The use of
    SHA-1 is not recommended for the generation of digital signatures in new
    systems; new systems should use one of the larger hash functions. For the
    present time, SHA-1 is included here to reflect it's widespread use in
    existing systems, for which the reduced security strength may not be of
    great concern when only 80-bits of security are required."
    (NIST SP800-57 Part 1. Footnote 23, page 62.)
NIST recommends SHA-224 for 2048 bit RSA and DSA2 keys and SHA-256 for 3072 bit
keys.  In practice SHA-256 is used for both. The same work is involved bor both.
SHA-224 is just a truncated SHA-256, albeit with a different initialization.
One of the very important, but least notied changes in RFC 4880 was that the WG
made it much easier to amend the RFC without rewriting the entire document. This
is how Camellia was included into OpenPGP and how ECC will most likely be included.
Expect to see some movement once the new NIST hash competition is complete.
I just created new keys after almost 8 years, my old key was 1024D/2048ElG. The
new keys are 2048-DSA2/2048-RSA and a 3x2048-RSA OpenPGP card.
3072 just felt like overkill for me.

"A key aspect of Suite B is its use of elliptic curve technology instead of

@_subject: Best Practices 
Good case in point of this, some weeks ago a user on another list was asking
about increasing his RSA key size to 8192 bits, based on reading that "Bruce
Schneier, in _Applied Cryptography_, has recommended a 8192 bit key if you want
it to have a useful lifetime beyond 2015."
It was pointed out, Bruce Schneier has done a lot of great work, but
relying on 14-year-old advice for RSA key sizes ignores current work and best
practice thought in cryptography. Over the summer, readers of the [Cryptography]
mailing list were reminded that in 1993 folks thought that 1024-bit RSA
'should be ok (safe from key-factoring attacks) for "a few decades".'
These are just two examples long term predictions that missed. Back when these
predictions were made, no one foresaw the development of Elliptic Curve
Cryptography which is looking likely to be the "upgrade" path for RSA/DSA2 keys
larger than 2048-3072 bits.
A 3072 bit RSA key is as tough as an ECC key based on a 256 bit field, which is
as tough as a 128 bit symmetric key.
ECC cryptosystems on a 256 bit field are practical today. 3072 bit RSA systems
are not.

If you lose your secret key or forget your passphrase and cannot recover them,

CD/DVD is one method. You may also want to take a look at paperkey,
While you are saving your secret key, generate a revocation certificate and save
it with the key rings on the CD and/or print it out with the paperkey copy.
You'll need it if you ever lose your secret key or forget your passphrase, and
cannot recover either of them.
XP & earlier: C:\Documents and Settings\\Application Data\GnuPG\
Vista & Windows 7: C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\GnuPG\
The file you need to save is secring.gpg. The files are small enough, you should
also save a copy of pubring.gpg and trustdb.gpg.

Whether one chooses to send his key to the keyservers or not, it is still a good
idea and in the interest of the OpenPGP community to utilize the keyservers.
*Public* key encryption is fostered by the *public* dissemination of keys and
the keyservers are, IMO, the best mechanism for that. I stand by my earlier
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... I see. Do they take their ball and go home? Do they jump up

Such key sequestration is a minority viewpoint and I doubt even a good number of
folks on a fully encrypted forum such as PGPNet would agree with you and would
instead support keyserver use.

We've discussed keyserver SPAM for a bit over five years among the development
team as well as on the Enigmail list.  Keyserver SPAM happens. Addresses are
harvested. We've tested and documented it. However, the quantity of keyserver
SPAM is statistically indistinguishable from that attributable to random noise.
That's the reason several of us downplay it's significance. It's a drop in the
bucket compared to the general firehose of SPAM.

It is never a good reason when it is the sole justification. It's a perfectly
valid reason when it has evolved from the ideas of a lot of Very Smart People?.
An /interesting/ thesis, However, to be taken seriously you need to back it up
with more than conjecture. There are plenty of obstacles to the widespread use
of encryption in the computing literature without grasping at straws to create more.
Widespread perception? Indeed? Please quantify. There are over 2.8 million keys
on the SKS keyservers with an average of just under 350 new keys added every
day.[0] The "keyserver SPAM" discussion surfaces maybe three to four times per
year across three lists. Odds on users will get more SPAM from asking a question
on a public mailing list such as this one than they will from that attributable
to keyservers.
"(rightly or wrongly)" Or imaginary? Rather than trying to convince us of new
"obstacles" without providing any evidence, you may wish to review what the HCI
folks say are the obstacles: "Why Johnny Can't Encrypt"[1], "Why Johnny Still
Can't Encrypt"[2], "How to Make Secure Email Easier to Use"[3], and a personal

Mostly Illusion. You only control the copy you publish or make available. You
have control over what signatures appear /until/ someone else has a copy of the
key. After that, you rely on their manners and ability to not make mistakes.
Many of the points you argue in this thread have been exhaustively discussed on
the list. You could compare this to a novel reading of law taking on a mountain
of precedent. It takes more than just the presentation of a case to convince
this body.
I've seen errant ideas criticized, not any person. The only irritant for me was
a breach of email etiquette.
I think most of us agree that the publishing of another person's key(s) is
mostly attributable to a) accident, or b) ignorance. I don't think malice
normally is a factor.
This is partly due to the fact that it is more difficult to mine addresses from
BigLumber. But you are only a factor of 4 or 5 away from what I measured due to
keyserver SPAM five years ago.
The original statement I made that started this entire discussion was, "> It is
also a good idea to send your key to the keyservers."
IIRC, we do this in the Enigmail Handbook[5]. But I've been distracted with
family issues as of late.
"Bald exhortation"? Honestly? You paint it as much more vociferous language than
it was. The pros and cons have been discussed, on this list, on the Enigmail

Locate GnuPG's HOME directory. The default on Vista (and I believe Windows 7)
will be C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\gnupg\. Running gpg.exe with the
--version switch will confirm this - just look for the line starting Home:.
Copy/move idea.dll to there.
You can safely delete that addition. I don't think anything uses that registry
value any longer.
In the same directory to where you copied idea.dll, use Notepad to create a text
file named gpg.conf. Include the line
    load-extension .\idea.dll
You may include other options in gpg.conf as well, but that line is what you're
looking for. Running "gpg --version" again should show IDEA as an available
cipher algorithm.

@_subject: Migrating from PGP to GPG question 
PGP and GnuPG have different mechanisms for marking the trust of a signing key.
In PGP, it's called 'Implicit Trust' and is a check box in Key Properties. It's
stored as part of the key.  In GnuPG, the same trust level is called 'Ultimate
trust' and trust values are stored in a separate file, trustdb.gpg. It's the
most common problem I've seen when a user migrates keyrings.
Having done this migration several times to answer migrating users' questions, I
can confirm the 'proper' solution is as Daniel suggested: edit your signing
key(s) and set the trust level to ultimate. 'Trust' will then propagate from
your key to the keys you have signed.

doing so better documents what your batch file is doing.
Your command isn't giving gpg anything to encrypt
ECHO bingos| GPG --batch -se --passphrase-fd 0 -r PGPTOKEY -u PGPTOKEY
-o "C:\EncryptedFiles\%%F.pgp" "%%F"

-e == --encrypt
-r == --recipient
gpg --output test.txt.gpg -e -r 0x359B3EB2 -r 0xDAE72D59 test.txt
Alternatively, you can set default-recipient in gpg.conf to your key

Which version?
The binary installer or do you build from source?
There should be a program named gpgkeys_hkp.exe in the same directory as gpg.exe

Issuing fetch within 'gpg --card-edit' and then 'gpg --card-status' have always
worked for me

Nope. fetch grabs the public key al? 'gpg --fetch'. From --card-edit's help:
Then --card-status creates the needed key stubs

@_subject: Need help doing gpg encryption without prompting for passphrase 
echo passphrase | gpg --armor --output encrypted_file.gpg 		\
 	"myusername at mycompany.com" --sign --encrypt file_to_encrypt.txt
You may want to look at using --passphrase-file  or
--passphrase-fd (see man page).
These problems go away by removing the passphrase from the key. Removing the
passphrase also removes the charade that things are all that secure when the
passphrase is in a file readable by anyone with enough access. ;-)
