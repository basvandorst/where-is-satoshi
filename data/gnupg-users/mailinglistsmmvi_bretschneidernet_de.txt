@_subject: key generation: email-address necessary? 
I want to recreate my GnuPG keys. My question is if I can omit the email address? Since I do not want my email addresses to appear on the keyservers because of spammers and so on. I only want to put my name and maybe my toplevel domain in the comment field.
Is the some kind of problem with this behavoir? Can email clients find out what key to use if there is no known email address?
What do you think?
Kind regards from the CeBIT town;)

Hi Laurent,
that was my expectation as well. But what do the email clients do then? Do they say "no key available" or do the look for the name? What are your experiences?
TIA  Martin

I know that it depends on the system; this is why I wrote the email since I think that here are people that know GnuPG in combination with several email clients...
Let's break down the problem: A and B have public keys on some keyserver. A has no email address in his public key, B does.
AFAIK there are these four use cases concering emails and OpenPGP:
1: A sends a signed email to B. 2: A sends a (signed and) encrypted email to B. 3: B sends a signed email to A. 4: B sends a (signed and) encrypted email to A. Use case 1 and 2 should be no problem. Based on the key information saved in the signature the email client of B should get the public key of A. The email adress does not matter.
Use case 3 should also be no problem since it does not deals with A public key.
Use case 4 is the problematic one, B's email client does not know anything about A. B's email client could search for A fore- and surename on a keyserver...
What do you think?
