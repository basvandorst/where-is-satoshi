@_subject: mutt message "skipped: public key already present" 
Hi ilf,
That problem may stem from having an "encrypt-to" line with your
key/email address in your GnuPG configuration.
Upon encryption GnuPG tries to obtain a list of keys to encrypt
to. GnuPG adds each recipient's key to this list (This includes your
key, due to the Cc). GnuPG adds the encrypt-to key (if one is given)
to this list.
So if you set encrypt-to to your own key, and Cc to yourself, your key
would be added twice to this list, and GnuPG warns against this.
mutt in turn sees that pgp_encrypt_only_command resulted in some
output on stderr and therefore pauses so you can read the output.
IIRC, mutt does not allow to skip the waiting (as $wait_key does not
apply here). pgpewrap does not allow to mangle stderr. GnuPG does not
allow to turn this logging off.
So either you insert some code to filter out this line of stderr
somewhere between those three programs, you patch either of those
three programs, or you get rid of the "encrypt-to" setting.
Maybe mutt's fcc_clear covers your use case?
Best regards,

Hi ilf,
Not that I know of.
Either compile GnuPG yourself after applying the patch from
... or bribe someone with commit access to push it and wait for a new
GnuPG release.
Best regards,

@_subject: Support of card readers with displays 
Dear list,
while several shops list smart card readers having built-in pin pads
and displays, I fail to find even a single such reader that is fully
supported by GnuPG. By that I mean
- Signing, encrypting, and other basic operations work,
- Pin entry via the card reader's pin pad is possible, and
- Pin prompts get shown on the card reader's display.
The list's last item is the problem.
Am I just lacking search engine foo, or does no such card reader
Best regards,
P.S.: Required operating systems, driver layers, etc are less of an
issue. But there are bonus points if the reader can be used under
GNU/Linux using free software only.
