@_subject: Calculated trust and ownertrust of signatures 
is there a way to see the trust values of all signatures on a key? I
would expect "gpg --listsigs --with-colons" to show both the
calculated trust and the ownertrust with each signature line, but this
is apperently not the case.
doc/DETAILS says the ownertrust value is only shown for public keys.
Why not for signatures? Is it possible to activate this somehow?
Trust information on signatures would be highly useful if you want to
examine the trust paths to a certain key.
