I believe it does though. Could you check?  Running the test suite
would be a fine proof.

zsh 3's memory allocation was guilty, but anyway autoconf is _very_
Well, have a look a ./aclocal.m4:798 and tell us what's in there.

I disagree with the comment, but won't debate about it.
The name is unquoted, and since 2.50 provide AC_SSY_LARGEFILE, the
name gets expanded.
Note that quoting the name is not good either, as you would loose
2.50's version which is very up to date, and is the reference.
Remove m4/largefile.m4 or what ever.  It is no longer needed.

Heck, should I say again?  It is *done*.

That's what I said: it's part of 2.50 now.
