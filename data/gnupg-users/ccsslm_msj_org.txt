@_subject: gpg encrypt hanging on AIX 5.1 
Installed gpg 1.2.1 on AIX 5.1.  Imported public key of third-party company successfully.  Am now trying to encrypt a test file with the following command:
gpg --output hartford_test.gpg --encrypt --debug-all --always-trust --recipient ra hartford_test.txt
No syntax problems, but the command just hangs.  With debugging on, I can see the last thing executed below:
gpg: DBG: mpi_free_limb_space of size 0
gpg: DBG: fd_cache_open (hartford_test.txt) not cached
gpg: DBG: iobuf-5.0: open `hartford_test.txt' fd=6
File `hartford_test.gpg' exists. Overwrite (y/N)? y
gpg: DBG: fd_cache_invalidate (hartford_test.gpg)
gpg: DBG: iobuf-6.0: create `file_filter(fd)'
Any ideas on why it never finishes?
