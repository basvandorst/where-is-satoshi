You bring up an excellent point here that can be generalized. Basically, in any automated task, it's probably a good idea to fully qualify the paths of any executable. Merely changing the system default configuration of the PATH variable can subtly alter a system if more than one copy of a program exist. By fully qualifying the path to the intended executable, you prevent such future problems.

I'm not a GPG-specific programmer, but I'd like to weigh in on this since I am a Unix programmer. Please indulge me if I'm off base here.
I like the idea of GPG running in its own protected, non-swapable address space with a strictly well-defined communication interface provided by the anonymous pipe of stdin and stdout, environment variables, and command-line arguments. If I were a library programmer, (especially a security library), I would want to make sure that nothing could accidentally step on the code that I've spent a lot of time making robust. A GPG co-process lives in its own protected address space which (if set up properly) cannot be paged because it is setuid-root on many systems. As an application programmer, I would not want some library creating weakness in my application either.
A linkable library, on the other hand, would be completely at the mercy of the library user (application programmer), just as the application is at the mercy of the library.
In Unix, just as userland applications are "quarantined" from (and by) the kernel in order to provide security and stability, and are only able to communicate with the kernel through well-defined and checked APIs, so would the application and GPG be protected from each other by acting as co-processes in a client-server model which provides a great deal of robustness.

By the way, if you are doing this in order to build a tarball that you can transplant to another system, you might not get what you expect.

They do this so that the location of files as specified in the man pages matches what the installer set during the build process. I'm not sure if GnuPG does this, however.

Then, once I get it finally compiling (running?), I now have a nearly unique configuration so removed from the distribution that I need to back it up for replication. Can I put something else on that system? Not likely. I'm right back to the one-app-per-box situation so common in the Windoze world.

Excellent write-up, Neil. You neglected to mention (mostly due to space considerations? ;) ) the various holes in Outlook provided by Windows Media Player, also.
I would like to point out that at least in OS X, the root account is completely disabled by default. There is an "admin" group, but as you probably know, no mere group has root access. It is not at all like the Administrator group in NT. Instead, members of the "admin" group are allowed to authenticate in order to do temporary root things. Sort of like what sudo provides for the command line. Programmers are required to use the standard authentication API in order to achieve this functionality. I'm not sure how it works, but unlike sudo, programs do not need to be set-uid-root for this to work. (I really must research how they do this.) Because of this, even when logged in as an administrator, one is unable to manipulate any of the system files, just as you described.
Apple (as are the other BSDs) are working towards minimizing the number of set-uid-root programs. Indeed, the gpg executable does not need to be set-uid-root on OS X in order to wire down memory pages (there is a fixed limit on the number of pages a non-root process can wire down). I imagine other Unixes would benefit by having this feature as well.
To be fair, Microsoft has been getting better on security, but only because of constant pressure against their bottom line from the alternatives. They still have quite some distance to go, however.

This gets annoying after while, especially if you find yourself needing to connect to said server while away from a host that has your private key. Being able to fall back to passwords is a nice convenience for most circumstances and, unless that Linux server of yours really contains sensitive information, I wouldn't worry about a password crack (unless you have really easy-to-guess passwords). Having to load your private key on a temporary host has its own set of vulnerabilities.
One thing that would help to slow down a password attack is successive increases in delays after each wrong password. Apple's implementation of OpenFirmware does that to keep people from trying to brute force that password. Perhaps you can configure "login" or "sshd" to do the same? Or recommend it to the OpenBSD folks.
I'm not knocking public-key authentication at all -- I use it almost exclusively -- and the ssh-agent makes life really nice. But disabling the fallback to passwords seems a bit obtuse, IMHO.

You are correct about combining files. The implementation of an archive or hierarchy or file system is quite platform-dependent. Each platform has its own idea about what constitutes a file. On unix, one would use "tar" to accomplish the same task, except tar provides no compression. Since compressing an already-compressed file is usually counterproductive, you might get better mileage by turning off compression when creating the archive and just use the compression provided by GnuPG during the encryption phase.

Hash: SHA1
The odds of you knowing someone who knows someone you know (three steps) are surprisingly high (at least in the US). I believe at last check the odds were around 1:100. Given that, you may receive a key that has been signed by someone you know or at least trust to verify the key in question.
Just because a key is signed with 100 signatures of people you don't know means nothing to you. But if one of those 100 signatures is by someone you know and trust -- that key is valid to you.
"Trust", in the PGP sense, is a personal, subjective level you assign to a person (represented by their key) when you know they conscientiously verify keys.
"Validity" is a measure of a key's authenticity based on the trust of attached signatures.
Personally, I assign no trust to anyone, because I have yet to meet anyone as conscientious in verifying keys as I am. Surely, there are, but I don't know them yet. Should I meet and observe someone verifying keys on a consistent basis over a period of time, I will increase their trust level, but for now, I only consider valid those keys which I have personally verified and signed.
Think of a trusted person as equivalent to a notary public. Just as a State considers valid those documents witnessed and signed by a notary public, so would you consider valid those keys signed by those you trust. In the WoT model, it's not a matter of the State granting trust, it's you.
Regarding public key signing parties, all they do is increase the odds that you encounter a key signed by someone you trust. A CA is just another "trusted" third person.

@_subject: alternate ids in key 
Hash: SHA1
Short answer:  multiple email addresses.
For instance, at work I have two valid email addresses -- a short one using only part of my name and a longer one using my full name. Both go to the same mailbox. Rather than send people two keys, I can send a single key with both IDs in it. That way, no matter which email address they use when sending me a message, the same key is used to encrypt the Similarly, you may have multiple mailboxes for various ISPs, etc. You can just add all your email addresses to one key. Email clients, when looking for a valid key, will try to match the email address you supplied in the header with the email addresses in the keys in your You may prefer to have different keys for each email account, but that's up to you.

I think it was hospitality which is notoriously full of Luddites. The vendors (airlines mostly) that I work with also like to generate separate keys for each partner. I suspect that they just don't grok what a public key really is. At my company we mandate either (1) SSH2 or (2) OpenPGP. If they don't play, we tell them to take a hike regardless of the "sensitivity" of the information.
Once an interface has been put into place, it's all too easy for marketing people to add more and more information until you've crossed the line into violating the EU Privacy Directive and/or the US Safe Harbor policy. It the interface is already secure, the marketing people can have their way with it.
I feel your pain regarding the EOLN conversion. It seems like the vendors who are using Windows are the least helpful. They always expect us Unix people to do their EOLN conversion.

1.2.3rc1 appears to be building correctly out of the box on 11.11 using the HP ANSI C compiler. I haven't tried it yet with GCC. The problems in random.c with the gettimeofday() are gone.
Also, for those using 11.11, HP has a kernel patch you can apply that will give you /dev/random. It's a free download from the software.hp.com web site. Search for the package name "KRNG11i". It will require a reboot.
I haven't been able to test this particular patch yet because we can't reboot our Superdomes until October.

I have encountered the same thing that you have. The problem is that you are trying to use GCC. When you use GCC it uses a different version of the file "sys/types.h" that does not contain all the symbols that HP's version of "sys/types.h". Try and change your configuration to use HP's ANSI C compiler. Specifically, GCC's version of sys/types.h does not define "bsize_t".

I guess I need to clarify a bit. If you use the GCC as supplied by the HPUX Porting and Archive Center (version 3.2) you will have a "sys/types.h" that is broken. However, if you use the GCC 3.2 supplied from the HP dev center, the sys/types.h has the rest of the symbols defined. If you use the HP ANSI C compiler, but make the one change to ./intl/gettextP.h to work around the broken "inline" keyword, you will get GPG 1.2.1 to work on HP/UX 11.11. The problem that Pedro described was due to the broken sys/types.h supplied with that particular implementation of GCC. When you say you have GPG working HP/UX 11 are you referring to 11.0 or 11.11 for PA-RISC or 11.20 for IPF? HP/UX is a very fragmented platform these days.

Never a dull moment with HP/UX... For some reason, autoconf did not correctly locate gettimeofday and flagged it as nonexistant. The build failed, but by modifying config.h to set the HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY to 1, GPG built just fine with no other issues.

While trying to compile ./util/g10u.c it seems that I've encountered a bug in DEC's (HP's) compiler. At the time that this header file is being compiled, the macro EXTERN_UNLESS_MAIN_MODULE is not defined. But, wonder of wonders, the C preprocessor does not evaluate either of the branches. At the point that iobuf_debug_mode is being defined, the macro EXTERN_UNLESS_MAIN_MODULE remains not defined at all. I ran this through the compiler with the -E option and was aghast at the results. For grins I inserted the following just before iobuf_debug_mode:
 EXTERN_UNLESS_MAIN_MODULE
EXTERN_UNLESS_MAIN_MODULE int iobuf_debug_mode;
and the compile aborts because it hit my  directive though it shouldn't have. I guess DEC's compiler doesn't like nested  directives?

Hash: SHA1
Users are confronted with the need for passwords/passphrases everywhere, whether it is for dialing in to their ISP via PPP, accessing email, etc. The only time one needs to use a passphrase is for decrypting and for signing. Asking for a passphrase to decrypt an email is not asking too much, I think.
On the other hand, I do understand your position, however. I know that my mother's iMac is quite secure and the odds of someone stealing her secret key are close to nil. I think I'd have better odds at winning the Powerball. The worst case should someone steal her secret key would be that they could read the email I send her, since I'm the only person that sends her encrypted email.
I think a lot of this depends on each situation (and individual) and needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. If the odds are higher that someone would forget their passphrase compared with the odds of having their secret key stolen, it might be more appropriate to leave the passphrase empty.

It would keep a copy of the secret key with the old passphrase, but you can store the file anywhere you want. Removable media makes sense for this as well. It all really depends on how secure your system is, or how secure the removable medium is.
The RCS commands of interest are "ci" and "co". See the man pages for details. Notably, "rcsintro(1)" is probably a good place to start. You can also use the "rcs" command along with "ci" and "co" for some additional features, (such as location of repository).
If the removable medium is secure, then maybe it would make sense to put an unencrypted secret key on it? That's up to you to decide, but at least then you'd never have to worry about losing your passphrase.

$ cat passphrase_file | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 ...
or from the stdin redirection
$ gpg --passphrase-fd 0 ... < passphrase_file.
Reading from stdin doesn't necessarily mean it must come from a file.  Your passphrase can come from a program that writes the passphrase to  $ my_agent | gpg --passphrase-fd 0 ...
And however "my_agent" securely stores your passphrase is left as an  exercise to the reader (e.g database).

If the passphrase is passed in as a parameter to the script, the  passphrase will be clearly visible in the process list (on Unix/ Linux) (via the "ps" command).
To be honest, there is really no way to properly secure a passphrase  for an automated system if the passphrase exists anywhere on that  system. All users with root access will be able to get to the private  key through some means.
If you are not worried about users with root access, then you don't  need to encrypt the private key, since non-root users won't be able  to read the secret key in the process's home directory.
It's a chicken-or-egg situation. If you can trust the root users, you  are better off keeping it simple and just not using an encrypted  private key. If you cannot trust the root users, you should not trust  the system at all.

@_subject: Newbie Q: decryption 
Two things:
1) You can't decrypt a file with a public key. Obviously the company  who sent you the file doesn't understand public-key encryption either  because they would need YOUR public key in order to encrypt files to  you. The first step for them would have been to request a key from  you. On the other hand, they might have merely signed the file and  the public key would be used by you to "verify" the signature and it  might not be encrypted at all. See next.
2) The "mpi too large" message would indicate to me that the file is  most like corrupted by the file transfer process. Check to make sure  that if the file is binary that the transfer method does not perform  conversion on end-of-line characters.
Another thing you can try to examine the file is to use the "--list- packets" command.
$ gpg --list-packets This will tell you (usually) whether the file is valid OpenPGP data,  as well as the algorithm and key ID used to encrypt the file (if it  is encrypted and not just corrupted).

Oh yeah, third thing:
The "insecure memory" warning just means that the executable probably  needs to be setuid-root in order to allocate wired memory. You can  ignore this and still use the product. It just means that gpg tried  to allocate memory that cannot be swapped to disk and failed due to  permissions. Some OS's allow non-root users to allocate a limited  amount of wired memory (BSD, OS X) whereas HP-UX does not.

The key as you see it in GD has expirations on all three subkey; two  expired, but one currently unexpired. The change I performed was to  move the expiration of the third subkey (EEA4EC97) to 2008-01-01. It  is this changed key that was rejected by GD. Would it be helpful to  send you the key as it currently exists in my keyring (which was  rejected) for comparison with what was previous acceptable? Also, the  expiration date on the subkey as it exists in GD was set at the time  the subkey was created, whereas the expiration on the subkey in my  keyring was changed post creation. Would that make a difference in  the representation? I'm not familiar enough with the details of the  spec. to know if this even makes sense.

Gotcha. The public key does not "generate" the key. I'm going to walk  through the process again, so please bear with me.
I'm going to send you a message.
GPG creates a random key from a source of entropy such as /dev/ random. This key is used in a symmetric cipher such as AES128 to  encrypt my message.
This symmetric KEY is then ENCRYPTED using your public key and  attached to the end of the message.
When you receive the message, you use your private key to DECRYPT the  symmetric key and then use the symmetric key to decrypt the message.
Since only your private key can decrypt the attached symmetric key,  only you can subsequently decrypt the message.

@_subject: If the message is encrypted symmetrically... 
Correct. If I'm sending a message that I want protected, I hash the  contents with something like SHA-1. I encrypt this hash with my  private key and attach the encrypted hash to the document.
Recipients can then compute their own hash of the document, decrypt  the attached, encrypted hash using my public key, and compare the  results. If the hashes match, the document is good, and non- repudiation has been established since it was encrypted with MY  private key.
To extend our discussion, suppose I wish to send an encrypted message  to multiple recipients. I would then encrypt the (randomly generated)  symmetric key to each recipient's public key in turn. All of the  encrypted copies (of the symmetric key) are attached. A valid  recipient will be able to encrypt his (and only his) copy of the  symmetric key and then decrypt the document.

2. Your key ID will be a number (e.g. CD55 18C7) not your name. If the name you indicate matches more than one key, the first is assumed.

In this case a detached signature would be your best bet. You would  check the detached sig in with the source code. When the source is  checked out, you could then validate that the source has not changed  since it was signed. Be careful, though, if you use any embedded  keywords with your revision control system ($Id$, et al). If the  revision control system changes the content of the files it will  invalidate the signature.

Conceptually there isn't anything really different between X.509  certificates and PGP keys with regards to encrypting email, other  than the trust models typically employed by each.
In the certificate model, one's certificate is issued by an  implicitly trusted third party. The root certificates are pre- installed by the operating system or software vendors and they just  work. Most email clients make using them quite simple.
PGP supports the rooted trust model, but it also supports other  models. Typically, although not exclusively, PGP uses the web of  trust where you must exchange keys ahead of time, and cross sign them  to establish explicit trust.
In practice, however, I can get non-technical people using  certificates in a lot less time then it takes to get them using PGP.  On the other hand, if you are encrypting files to be distributed via  HTTP or FTP, I find PGP a lot easier to work with than certificates.
In reality the two technologies are almost identical, but the end- user tools need a lot of work to truly blur the current artificial
