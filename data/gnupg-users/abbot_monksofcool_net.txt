Export the signed key and send it back to the owner. As was mentioned
here before, and I agree, it is not for you to decide whether the key
(with or without your signature) is published on a key server.

Are you suggesting that people "in the know" should let people with a
potentially harmful lack of knowledge stay blissfully unaware? What good
would that do?
I think that, in light of your message, is quite a ridiculous signature.

I have written to the list owners but did not receive a reply yet, and I
also wonder if anybody else has experienced this:
I tried to subscribe with new at dom.ain and unsubscribe with old at dom.ain
by sending email to gnupg-users-request at gnupg.org from each of this
addresses. Firstly, I find it very irritating that messages to the
mailing list robot are subjected to greylisting delay of at least one
hour. Secondly, I have received two replies with different confirmation
codes for each of my (un)subscription attempts -- four codes total.
It seems to me that the mailing list robot is experiencing hiccups. Can
anybody here confirm this?

I used "subscribe" and "unsubscribe" as subjects for my (un)subscription

I also tried to unsubscribe using the URL provided in the headers, in
which case I received one confirmation code per attempt (not two per

in the web form.
I've since managed to unsub my old address, but something definitely
feels borked here. I have "rolled" my address for about a dozen mailing

I wrote "using the Tor Network as a foundation", but in this case it

be accessed using only the Tor Browser (I don't see a reason for mail in

also be an option.

happen to have created and run messaging board software, also known as
bulletin board software, since the 1980s (e.g. FidoNet, Z-Netz), and I
don't see the necessity for using mail in a MBS/BBS at all.
c) the OP proposed a centralized approach and stated "The general
process of the server would be to receive a message via HTTPS".
Seriously, it strains my patience if participants in a discussion fail
to pay attention.

@_subject: gpg-agent, pinentry and Emacs 
I asked about the following on the Notmuch mailing list first, and
Daniel Kahn Gillmor offered some advice, but the issue is not yet
resolved. I'm hoping for additional input from the GnuPG community.
I use Dovecot with a Maildir-based message store, allowing me to access
my mail using various IMAP based clients. I also use Notmuch[1] with
Emacs as a MUA, and for that, I login using SSH and a terminal, which of
course means no graphics beyond Ncurses.
  [1] This works fine until I encounter signed or encrypted mail (GPG and/or
S/MIME). Emacs attempts to prompt me for my password, or to ask me
whether I trust signator XYZ, but crams that prompt into the last two
lines of the Emacs window, so I cannot really see what is expected of
I use gpg-agent and have tried both pinentry-tty and pinentry-curses. I
tried with and without 'allow-emacs-pinentry' in gpg-agent.conf. I tried
'epa-pinentry-mode' with values 'nil' and 'loopback'. All this did not
resolve the issue.
Daniel suggested "running gpg-agent in a dedicated terminal window, and
handling the gpg-agent prompts from that window". I tried to achieve
that by setting GPG_TTY to a fixed value like /dev/pts/1, and running
Emacs in /dev/pts/2. This works for a single time only. When prompting
me the next time, parts of my input are echoed on the screen, and when I
press return, the shell in pts/1 attempts to execute my pass phrase. It
looks like pinentry died halfway, so my input ends up in the shell.
I you have suggestions about how to solve this, I'd be grateful.

As far as I can tell, that's what epa-pinentry-mode is used for (which I
tried unsuccessfully, as stated in my OP). I think I have tried every
EasyPG trick and workaround that I could find searching the Net, but
still no dice.
I just tried that as well. Adding "pinentry-mode loopback" to gpg.conf
unfortunately causes Emacs to no longer attempt to decrypt messages.

The socket exists and the permissions look OK (read/write access for my

I just tried the following wrapper script:

  echo "INSIDE_EMACS is '$INSIDE_EMACS'" >> /tmp/$(basename $0).log
  /usr/bin/pinentry-tty
When opening an encrypted message, the result is as follows:
  $ cat /tmp/pinentry-wrapper.log
  INSIDE_EMACS is ''
Looking at the local build settings, I believe so. Is there a way to
figure this out with no room for doubt with pinentry version 1.1.0?
I did that, but I cannot seem to locate the debug output. Where is it

Thanks. I did that, and also added 'verbose'. The output does not tell

I did try to enter my pass phrase, but my interpretation of the above
timeout is that my input never made it back to gpg-agent?
I am not quite sure how to best debug this further. In my OP I mentioned
trying to have pinentry in a separate, dedicated terminal? Is that
possible, and if so, how would I set it up? Like I wrote, setting
GPG_TTY to a fixed value only works for a single time.

@_subject: a new free smime service, but... 
* Steffen Nurpmeso:
Nope, that is the wrong way round. The correct sequence to obtain an
S/MIME certificate is as follows:
1. User X creates a private key *locally*. This private key must never
be handed to anybody else.
2. User X creates a certificate signing request (CSR) and sends it to a
certificate authority (CA).
3. The CA uses the CSR to create a signed certificate, and sends that
certificate back to user X.
4. User X can then optionally combine private key and signed certificate
in a .p12 file to ease importing the data *locally* in his MUA (it is
usually more convenient to deal with a single file that combines both
private key and certificate).
If the process is altered in any way in which a third party gets hold of
user X's private key, security is broken, no matter if the private key
is password protected or not.

S/MIME certificates have been repeatedly discussed and rejected in the
LE community, pretty much since LE's inception. There even used to be a
related FAQ entry.
One reason is that LE's self declared goal is to provide certificates
for web servers, and email communication between individuals is quite
a different beast.

What "properly" means is quite subjective.
My own .gnupg directories are under Git control. Imagine two computers,
let's call them alpha and bravo, in my local network, which both only
allow access via SSH key based authentication. Assuming that alpha is
the "master" (meaning I add keys and modify trust settings there), I can
initially transfer the data by running
  cd /home/ralph
  git clone ralph at alpha:/home/ralph/.gnupg
on machine bravo. All future updates can then be transferred by simply
invoking "git pull".
For obvious reasons one should not put GnuPG key material on GitHub or
similar, but if you do have your own, secure Git repository (which I
have), you can add that to the mix.
A nice side effect of this method is that my GPG key rings are fully
version controlled.

As you guessed, it is not possible, because you require the private key
