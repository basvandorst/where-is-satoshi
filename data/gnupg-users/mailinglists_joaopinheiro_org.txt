@_subject: Running GnuPG from a USB Pen Disk 
Greetings everyone.
I was wondering if anyone here would be able to help me out with a
little problem I'm facing. I'm currently being required to use quite a
lot of different machines and architectures every day. It gets a bit
complicated for me to be able to use GnuPG on every single one of
them. Up until now I have been carrying a pen disk with my keyring,
the source code for gnupg and the windows installer around with me. It
gets quite annoying for me to compile/install and configure gnupg on
every single machine I need to use. For that reason, I would like to
know if it would be possible for me to run gnupg from my usb pen disk
using a common keyring directory for all architectures. Things would
be organized something like this:
Would anyone be able to give me some pointers on how to achieve this?
While I think the linux one would be easy to achieve, I'm not sure of
how to do this on Win or Mac. I have noticed that the windows
installer adds several elements to the windows registry. How can I
work around this? Would compiling my own windows version help me get
around this issue?
Thanks in advance,
Jo?o Pinheiro
