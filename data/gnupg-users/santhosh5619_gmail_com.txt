@_subject: Query on PGP Keygen using GNUPG 
Hi Team,
I'm trying to execute the PGP Key generation using "SUNWgnupg" available on
Solaris 11 with CLI option mentioned below.
May I know the attributes to be used for giving Key Size as 2048 , Key
algorithm as RSA etc. in single CLI instead of routine way of generating
Appreciate if you can help me with quick reply to proceed with my work. PFA
for server details and version present on Solaris 11 server
