Hash: SHA1
Perhaps it's misleading to focus on the pseudonym "adrelanos". For me,
what's important is knowing that all Whonix releases come from the
same source (person, collective, etc).
Having an email address associated with the whonix-signing key
provides some assurance that support requests and bug reports are
going to the right place. It's also useful to know that the adrelanos
on this list is the Whonix signer at adrelanos at riseup.net with gnupg
key fingerprint "9B15 7153 925C 303A 4225 3AFB 9C13 1AD3 713A AEEF".
Over time, with ongoing peer review, "Whonix signer" aka adrelanos
develops a reputation for releasing useful and malware-free software,
for promptly patching all reported vulnerabilities, and so on. If
malware were found in Whonix, the reputation would diminish.
Peer-verified reputation is crucial in many contexts, especially where
government-issued identification is unworkable. Even so, that's not
enough, because most participants lack the necessary information and
Also, reputation is not simply one-dimensional. If verifiable evidence
were presented linking Whonix/adrelanos to some organization or cause,
that might decrease adrelanos' reputation among some, and increase it
among others. Reputation is also multidimensional in other ways (e.g.,
expertise, financial integrity, on-time delivery and discretion).
Trusted third parties manage peer-verified reputation in particular
contexts. For example, Onionland marketplaces manage the reputations
of their sellers and buyers, whose accounts are linked to their gnupg
keys. There are also brokers that manage reputation more broadly.
Expecting gnupg to handle all that might be unrealistic. Multiple
trust parameters would be required, and consistent use in multiple
contexts would be difficult or impossible to enforce. But gnupg keys
can serve as the index for reputation data.

Would it be feasible to use gpg in batch mode to generate numerous keys,
selecting for a particular key ID, or perhaps a longer part of the
fingerprint? I'm aware of shortcuts for creating keys with arbitrary key
IDs, but they produce keys with atypical key lengths etc. Based on
limited experience, I suspect that entropy would be the limiting
resource. Is that correct?
I imagine that websites could provide random alphanumeric strings to new
users, and require them to generate functional GnuPG keys (with normal
key length etc) with fingerprints that begin with the specified strings.
Having accomplished that, new users could edit their key, and specify an
account name and email address.

Doing anything "anonymously" in physical space is hard. You could buy
with cash in a store, in a city where you are not known, and take
precautions to reduce the risk of surveillance. Or you could pay someone
to do that for you. But then they know about it :(
You can buy online, but then there's the need for a shipping address.
Obtaining an "anonymous" shipping addresses is nontrivial. There's the
gambit of shipping to a randomly chosen address with an unsecured
mailbox. With tracking information, you can know when the package will
be delivered, and show up right after delivery. But that's iffy, and
vulnerable to surveillance.
For example, one can anonymously buy from Amazon. First buy some
Bitcoins. Then anonymize them by transferring through mixing services,
using Multibit wallets in Whonix instances. Then convert them to an

Yes, emails commonly contain HTML, embedded images and links. But Efail

That is, this isn't really about GnuPG. It's about email OPSEC.
However, I get that many users expect HTML, embedded images and links.
So the best solution would be a tweak to GnuPG that breaks HTML and
embedded remote content. That would protect against Efail, no matter how
email clients were configured. It'd also protect against other exploits
that depend on fetching remote content. And it wouldn't require users to

The problem is that many users of up-to-date email clients seem to want
HTML with remote content. That allows Efail, but only if OpenPGP does
not hard fail for unauthenticated cyphertext. And that typically breaks
decryption of cyphertext created by old software, which didn't require
authentication by default.
Yes, "accepting new emails with old crypto" is the problem. But Efail
relies on cyphertext embedded in URLs, which won't unauthenticate.
Anyway, the solution is arguably making decryption of iffy cyphertext an
option that must be explicitly selected. Not the default.

it's not at all your fault.
Nonetheless, your key on the SKS keyservers is hosed. It could happen to
anyone. And given the design, it can't be fixed.
However, it's not like your key and its authentic signatures are lost.
You have it on your machines, it's at  and you
could put the key on hkps://keys.openpgp.org or another keyserver.
So it's not you that's getting thrown under the bus. It's the SKS
keyserver network that's getting thrown under the bus.
And if someone needed signatures only available from the SKS keyservers,
there must be some way to recover them. One could import the key safely,
edit the signatures, and then put it on some secure keyserver.

Thanks. That's almost right. But I'm not focusing on incentives. I'm
focusing only on impacts. Because as I understand it, you can't stop
people from poisoning certificates on the SKS keyservers.
I didn't forget about that. I just don't think that it matters. Unless
I've misunderstood the situation, the SKS keyservers are dead meat. And
have been dead meat for a decade.
So the focus has gotta be on a secure and capable replacement. And
meanwhile, on mitigating damage done through the SKS keyservers.

No, I did mean blackholing poisoned certs.
It does seem that it's impossible to keep certs on the current SKS
network from being poisoned. I only see two alternatives: 1) fixing SKS,
and 2) replacing SKS. And meanwhile, preventing poisoned certs on SKS
from doing further damage.

I wasn't suggesting that. As long as only a few keys are being poisoned,
it's arguably not necessary, and too disruptive. But if this becomes a
game in the chans, that might become necessary.
That's what I meant. Plus some mechanism for testing keys, so poisoned
ones are blocked, as soon as possible.
It'd also be useful for SKS to report "this key has been poisoned", and
suggest alternative sources, rather than just failing silently.
Makes sense.
But less work than actually fixing SKS, right?

Damn. But all is likely not lost.
If you can open Enigmail Preferences, go to the Keyserver tab, and
specify only keys.openpgp.org as the keyserver. That way, if you manage
to fix gpg, Enigmail won't break it again. Also see "100% CPU usage

You'll very likely need to use gpg in terminal. I suspect that GPA may
be just as wedged as Enigmail.
Maybe someone could post a step-by-step guide for fixing gpg. For people
who don't commonly use it in terminal. I suppose that I could import one
of the poisoned keys in a fresh VM, and explore how to fix it. But I'm
sure that someone reading this could just dash it out.

And not only that, it's tied to one of the least privacy-friendly
aspects of smartphones: the phone number.[0]
Sure, it's not necessarily the number of the phone that you're using
Signal on. But it's gotta be a number that you can use, and which others
can't use. So what do you do, to avoid geolocation?
You can't use one of those shared SMS services. So what, lease a SIM
from some SIM farm in wherever, and hope that they're honest?
There's also the issue of actually using Signal while preventing
geolocation. You can't just use Tor, which itself is nontrivial on
smartphones, because Signal needs UDP. So you're stuck with VPNs, where
you must trust providers.
It's frightening how popular Signal has become. Especially for people
whose lives are threatened by geolocation. If I were paranoid, I'd say
that it was a honeypot. But whatever. Something using Tor onion services
is probably the best option. Unless Tor is also a honeypot.

Either that, or it's the assumption that people won't do bad things.
That was apparently a common assumption, back in the day.
Yes. I gather that people working on really key stuff have likely been
very aware of this issue, perhaps for years, and are protected. But
there are probably many who were/are unaware, and are vulnerable.
I don't think that it's necessary to stop using SKS keyservers. And I
suspect that doing so would be nontrivial. Given that requests to them
are likely hard-coded, or buried in obscure options and preferences.
Stuff that nobody has touched for years.
I believe that the most practical approach is 1) efficiently finding
toxic keys, and 2) reconfiguring keyservers not to serve them. I get
that many find this distasteful, doing the attackers' work for them,
etc, etc, etc. But it would limit damage, to the extent that toxic keys
can be identified soon enough. And there are other ways to share good
copies of those keys. Via Keybase, for example. Or as you say, manually.
I doubt that solutions depending on client behavior could ever work.
It doesn't need to be a new standard. People have been working or that
for years, and there's been much progress. But apparently there's
nothing yet that satisfies all use cases.
Same here about b. But from what little I know about SKS keyservers,
"data came, data stay" ain't gonna change. So they'll just need to
handle the junk. But it's arguably good enough if they can not serve
junk to client apps that can't handle it.

I'm not suggesting any controls on a server-by-server basis. I'm
suggesting that blacklisting of toxic keys be a software update. And as
the Tor network does, keyservers would ignore peers running outdated
Also, if what I propose is workable, toxic keys won't matter. They'll
just be wasted space on the keyservers. And indeed, "poisoning them over
and over again" isn't at all an issue. Given that toxic keys, or the
signatures that poison them, can't actually be removed. By design, to
prevent censorship.
If what I propose is workable, attackers can poison as many keys as they
like. Until SKS keyservers go down, anyway. Until then, if the system
catches them quickly enough, they won't do widespread damage. They'll
inconvenience some people, of course, but that seems unavoidable. And as
an extra benefit, this would nuke file systems that store data in

Moved by Roland's requests, I've broken Enigmail in a fresh VM. And I'd
appreciate some advice about how to fix it.
I installed Thunderbird and Enigmail in a Debian 9.5 x64 VM with Gnome.
Using Enigmail Key Management, I tried to get rjh's 1DCBDC01B44427C7
from pool.sks-keyservers.net, but that just timed out.
So I downloaded it via HTTPS. And it was ~60MB. I tried importing from
the downloaded file, but that went nowhere. With 100% CPU.
So I got it from  and imported from clipboard in
Enigmail Key Management. That worked just fine. So then I tried
refreshing keys in Enigmail, leaving pool.sks-keyservers.net as the
default keyserver. And that failed, complaining about no dirmngr. Then I
tried refreshing keys with gpg in terminal, and got the same error about
no dirmngr.
Then I deleted rjh's key, and got my own from Keybase, and imported it.
But when I tried refreshing keys, I got the same error about no dirmngr.
So gpg must still work, because I can import and delete keys via
Enigmail. But something seems borked about dirmngr. I guess that I'll
try purging and reinstalling. Or is there a better fix?
And yes, I should have tested everything first with a clean key, before
messing with rjh's key. Is it likely that I borked dirmngr during the
intital attempt to get it from pool.sks-keyservers.net?

Well, that's why I only use phones (and not smartphones) for routine
meatspace stuff where I don't care about privacy. If the NSA wants to
know about my dental appointments, fine.
You're missing the point. Signal not only doesn't hide network-level
metadata, it embeds it in the content. As the bloody account ID.
I mean, I'm sitting here at a computer. It has lots of firmware IDs, a
MAC address, and a public ISP-assigned IP address. But none of that
stuff, unless I am sadly mistaken, shows up in my online activity. In
the headers of this message, for example. Because I use nested VPN
chains, plus Tor when I really want some anonymity.
So the equivalent here to Signal would be that my email address had to
be associated with my ISP-assigned IP address. And for sure, that's how
it was 20 years ago, when I used an email address from my ISP. I used
PGP for content privacy, but there was zero anonymity.
So how is that bullshit acceptable in 2019?
Sure. But I can start with a popular VPN, and maybe 20% of people around
me use VPNs for pirating, so that's not too unusual. What's unusual is
what I route through that VPN. But even discovering that would take some
work, and then they'd just see another VPN. The won't see Tor until they
drill down 3-4 VPNs.
It's not just cellular modems that enable geolocation. There's GPS. And
there are databases with locations of WiFi APs. If it were possible to
securely use VPNs and Tor on smartphones, geolocation wouldn't be any
more of an issue than it is for me, sitting here at my computer.

Damn. Somehow dirmngr didn't get installed with Thunderbird and
Enigmail. How embarrassing. So now Enigmail does refresh my key.
But after importing rjh's key, refreshing in Enigmail fails:
I also tried in terminal:
Then I disabled rjh's key, and found that my key still refreshed
quickly. Using hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net.
So that's good news, yes? Trying to refresh rjh's key failed, but it
failed quickly, and the attempt apparently didn't break anything.

It sounds like SKS is dead meat. And hagrid is coming. And you advise:
So OK, I can purge requests to SKS keyservers from my machines. But what
about upstream impacts? As I understand it, GnuPG authentication is
pervasive. And I suspect that getting missing keys from SKS is common.

This is undoubtedly a naive question. But anyway, would it be feasible
to test keys by importing them, and seeing which ones break OpenPGP?
Maybe do it in minimal Docker containers? And then somehow block access
to those keys?
Or is blocking just as impossible as deleting?
I know that wouldn't help people whose keys had been poisoned. But at
least it would help protect complex systems that rely on OpenPGP.
And if resource requirements would be impossible, what about focusing on
the most important keys? For key packages, say.

Currently, we know that three keys are bad. How soon do you think that
bad keys will outnumber good ones? Weeks? Months? Years?
Your third point is actually why I suggested this. Maybe I'm just
twisted, but what if some dickhead goes after certs that would break
stuff for millions of people? One might, for example, block Linux kernel
maintenance and development. Maybe just before using some 0-day.
It would stop when certs can no longer be poisoned. And I don't see the
downside. I mean, what good does it do to have people downloading keys
that break their stuff?
I don't see that as "doing the bad guys? work for them". I see it as
preventing bad guys escalating from hurting a few people to doing
serious damage. That's not "punishing the victim".
Also, I presume that key owners could temporarily disable signature
checking, delete malicious signatures, and put their keys on secure
keyservers. But until secure keyservers exist at requisite scale,
blackholing seems like the simplest option. If it's doable, anyway.
