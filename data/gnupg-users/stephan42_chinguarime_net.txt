G'day list,
as I was adviced in de.comp.os.unix.apps.kde I would like to bother you with a question regarding kmail and gpgme. To keep a long and boring story short, I can't get it to work. All I get is a message telling me:
"Bibliotheksdatei des Moduls /usr/lib/libgpgme.so.11 konnte nicht geladen
(code: /usr/lib/libgpgme.so.11: undefined symbol: initialize)"
Well, sorry it's in german. It means like couldn't load shared object I tried to get that to work for a very long time now, every now and again trying it whenever new versions of gnupg or kde came out but whatever I do, it always shows this message in a msg box when I start kmail. When I try to display an PGP/MIME signed or encrypted mail, it says in the header 'No suitable plugin found,  /usr/lib/libgpgme.so.11: was not initialized'
I tried several tutorials, including one I found in the archive of that list and that one at My system is Fedora Core 2 on a duron if that matters. KDE is 3.2.3 stable from rpm but I've had the problem for a long time and several kde versions now starting with RedHat9. The rest of the system should be pretty ordinary but I vaguely remember havin experimented with that stuff for a long time now so it might be possible that some relics are interfering in some way. However, I double checked everything I know about that and I don't really think so since I did also run ldd on gpgme and followed all the links and found nothing suspicious.
I tried to install all versions of gnupg, the agent, libgcrypt, gpgme and libassuan I could find. From tarball, rpm, src.rpm, all sorts of experiments but I didn't succeed yet and before I eventually give up once more to try it again in a couple of month I would appreciate any suggestions from you guys.
BTW, gnupg inline works fine.

That doesn't even exist for me.
Do you remember were that comes from?
Gpgme didn't install it here and I can't see any ./configure option for that I tried both many many times without result. However, I thought for PGP/MIME this tab is not really relevant but rather the plugin tab. You use kde3.3

You haven't got any idea where to get this have you?
The only versions of libgcrypt I can find are above 1.1
And do you reckon those problems will be gone with kde3.3? I didn't install the beta2 yet since this is a production system I don't want to mess up with
