OK. I'm back at the office tomorrow (Monday) and I'll try it then.

Yes, the body of the message is not encrypted, but I've used a KGpg signature.
How do I tell? I don't normally use MIME if I can help it,

Thanks, John, but I knew that. What I can't figure out is how to upload the revocation certificates to a key server. Bob.

@_subject: Why are signatures marked as bad? 
I'm using the KGpg that comes with Suse 10.1. I use the KDE desktop and hence Kmail to send my email. When I sign a message with my personal key, when it leaves my outbox the message is marked by a green banner saying "Message was signed by bob at rsmits.ca (Key ID: 0xA3DF27D8336EF8A7).
The signature is valid and the key is ultimately trusted."
If I send it to myself, the messages comes back with a red banner saying "Message was signed by bob at rsmits.ca (Key ID: 0xA3DF27D8336EF8A7).
Warning: The signature is bad."
The signature itself is not outdated, so why is this happening?
Thanks, Bob.

Thanks to some suggestions from the posters to this list I did some further work. First I uploaded the sigs to the key servers. I removed bogofilter from the laptop because I thought the added filter notice might be changing the file size. None of this worked. I do notice, however, a change in file size when I compare the sent and received files.
With the sent file, the multipart signed section is 1.3 KB, the body part is a Plain Text Document 96 Bytes, and a Detached OpenPGP Signature of 189 Bytes
The file I received back had a multipart signed section of 2.2 KB, the body part is a Plain Text Document 96 Bytes, and a Detached OpenPGP Signature of 189 Bytes.
It's obvious that something has changed, but I have no idea what is causing Thanks, Bob.

As some of you may know, I've been having bad signatures on my SuSE 10.1 KDE install. I use Knontact/Kmail/Kgpg for mail. Messages I send to myself that are gpg signed are coming back marked as having bad signatures.
This occurs whether or not the keys are exported to key servers.
I have experimented :
1.	Using entirely new signatures created by kgpg.
2. 	Using signatures without pictures, in case the size of the pictures had an 		  	effect.
3	Using signatures created in Windows with PGP 8.1and sent with Eudora (Win)
No matter what I do from the Linux side signatures are marked as bad when they return from the server (I'm sending them to myself).
Messages with PGP 8.1 signatures from the Windows side come back just fine. When I receive them in Kmail they are marked as good signatures.
Here is the discovery. When I look at mail in the sent box in kmail, the signatures are marked as good signatures, but the sig id has changed.
The key signature has an id of 0x3E6E37DA when I look in the KGpg key management window. When I look at the sent message it's marked with the following key:  0xECE5238D3E6E37DA.
So, even though the key is green and says it has a good signature, the key id has changed.
Since all the machines around here do this, and I have Suse 10.1 installed on all three Linux boxes, and this behaviour occurs on all three, the next thing I'm going to try is to install Kubuntu on a laptop to see if this occurs with it, too. If it does, then it's got to be something in KDE, Kmail, Kontact, KGpg etc. I'll let the list know if I make any further progress.

@_subject: Still Bad Signatures - KGPG seems broken 
I've been trying for some time to figure out why messages from me that are gpg signed come back to me with the signature marked bad. I run three different computers all with SuSE 10.1, and use KMail/Kontact/Kgpg for all my email. Whenever I send my own signature to either a mailing list or to myself, the signature comes bad with red banners marked bad.
When I look in the sent mail box on Kmail, the same message is marked as having a good signature. This occurs no matter which machine I send it from, my work computer, my home desktop or my laptop.
I discovered that I could send a PGP signature from a Windows partition using Eudora/PGP 8.1 and the signature comes through marked as good. I've even tried back levelling Suse to version 10.0 but I get exactly the same results as with SuSe 10.1
Since I can send a message from the Windows Partition through my ISP and I can receive it on either my Linux partition or my Windows partition with a good signature I come to the conclusion that the ISP isn't doing anything bad to the email, but that it has something to do with what happens to it when I send it. I wonder if anyone else with a similar setup (Suse 10.1/Kmail/Kontact/Kgpg) can try sending themselves a signed email and see if this problem is systemic or mine alone.

When I google "gnupg Windows client" I find the following programs in Windows that are supported:
    Is a plug-in for Mozilla's mailer.     Is a plugin for the proprietary Eudora MUA.     Gpg4win is an installer package for Windows with computer programs and handbooks for email and file encryption.     GPGee (GNU Privacy Guard Explorer Extension) is a shell extension that adds Windows explorer right-click menu support for GnuPGIs a MS-Windows program to integrate GnuPG into the Desktop.     Is a plugin for the proprietary Outlook Express MUA.     A plug-in for Microsoft Outlook 2003.     Is a Windows program which can be used to use GnuPG with all MUAs. Pocket GnuPG
    Pocket GnuPG is the PocketConsole port of GnuPG.     Scribe is a small and fast email client that lets you send, receive and manage email without fuss. Scribe comes with a plugin that calls GnuPG.     Is a very nice GTK+ based MUA with full support for GnuPG. The Windows version is part of Gpg4win .     wija is a free and cross-platform Jabber/XMPP client written in Java, with built-in GnuPG key rings management GUI. Its extended protocols allow users to encrypt chat and multi-user chat as well as encrypting/signing messages and signing presence of the user. It is multilingual and runs on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. Possibly one of these can work for you. bob at rsmits.ca

Well, it didn't use to be this way. It seems to have broken in the last few No, it only seems to happen to me. That is, If I send a message to someone else it's normal and the sig is good. But if I send a message to myself, or to a mailing list and I then receive it myself, the sig is marked bad.
I can receive signed messages from other people just fine, however. Thanks, Bob

It's not just one mailing list, Chris, it's all the lists I subscribe to, and most of them appear to run mailman. It also happens when I send mail to I've submitted it as a bug to the kde group.
