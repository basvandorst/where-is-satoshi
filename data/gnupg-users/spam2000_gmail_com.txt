Hello Ilias,
When you use the "--export-secret-keys" option you will not be prompted for
a password.  This also scared me the first time I ran the command because I
was thinking that my private-key could be exported by any hacker that got
on my system.  But do not fear, the keys that gets exported with this
option are in their encrypted form and would require your password to make
use of.

@_subject: collision vs. preimage attacks: policy for signing data created 
So the question is...
1.) I have two different messages that have the same hash value (a
           hash("foo") = abcdefg
           hash("bar") = abcdefg
2.) Now you want to append identical new data to the messages and see if
the new hashes would still be collisions?
          hash("foo and here are some more words") = tuvwxyz
          hash("bar and here are some more words") = tuvwxyz
Is this your question?
