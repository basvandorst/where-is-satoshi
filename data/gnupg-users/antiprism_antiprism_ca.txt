@_subject: New project with GnuPG frontend for XBMC 
This might be interesting to the community:
AntiPrism is a tool for very secure web-browsing and communication. It is implemented as a set of extensions to the OpenELEC-derived media center software providing a universal and seamlessly integrated web privacy solution for home and small office. It runs from a read-only file system within a secure Linux operating environment bootable from a USB flash drive or installable on a HDD/SSD. AntiPrism is activated with a password used as an encryption key to a hidden file system. Once deactivated, it leaves no traces of its operations. The computer device running AntiPrism can serve as a media center for watching movies, streaming music and games, and general web surfing with the included basic web browser, because the basic XBMC/Kodi external plug-ins functionalities are preserved and acting as an anonymizing tool in the The main differences between AntiPrism and other existing anonymizing Linux derivatives (Tails, Whonix, Liberte, etc) are dictated by its purpose. AntiPrism provides, basically, a ?secure anonymizing media center?, a household device that would normally do little when not being used for entertainment, but is now loaded with new hidden powers. For example, you can anonymously search, download and watch your torrents right on the device, without a need to copy them elsewhere. It can run as an intermediate or entry node in the anonymous networks extending their strength and improving availability. It has a noticeably high performance, due to the fast Systemd Linux backend with close to real-time IRQ response and low network packets losses.
AntiPrism is implemented as a set of built-in media center plugins. It provides anonymous surfing and networking with popular traffic anonymizing tools Tor, I2P and Privoxy. It implements a web of trust communications security model by using GnuPG for keys and contacts exchange.
Encrypted file container keeps your sensitive data as well as private keys, secure identities and so on. Private keys and identities wouldn?t leak outside your device even if it is stolen, or your computer is infected by viruses/trojans. For encryption, both Cryptsetup (Linux-native disk encryption system, default) and TrueCrypt 7.1a (optional) are fully supported. For access control, pre-configured AppArmor rules are guarding the protected files.
The built-in AntiPrism web browsing, messaging and file sharing services are protected with Tor and I2P. Private keys used by Tor, I2P, SSH, OpenVPN, etc services of AntiPrism are stored within the encrypted file system and are protected with AppArmor kernel security module.
External browsers may use AntiPrism as a secure anonymizing proxy. The connection between the browser and AntiPrism can be optionally encrypted with a point-to-point VPN tunnel, eliminating the risks of intranet-based surveillance.
AntiPrism can be freely downloaded from its GitHub release repository -
