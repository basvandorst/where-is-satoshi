@_subject: Signatures on GnuPG 
HI there, I am interested in using this nice looking software, but I see some problems with teh signatures.  The key I down loaded from the web site is this  1024D/57548DCD 1998-07-07 Werner Koch (gnupg sig) that is from your web site (official GnuPG).
I am puzzled to find that the rpm's that I down load are signed with "pg: Signature made Mon Jan 17 04:21:20 2000 EST using DSA key ID Any suggestions?  Where is this other key available?  Why the Thanks,
