Hi, Congratulation for 10th birthday!
I got GnuPG 1.4.8 for Windows(gnupg-w32cli-1.4.8.exe) now, and in the README-W32 file:
No Vista in supported system. Any problem still remain on Vista?
( I know one problem has already fixed by following:
 )
It seems that installing GnuPG on Vista is OK.

I see, thankyou.
Would you please update a webpage  too?
BTW, the following message appeared when running gpg.exe at the only first time on Vista.
In detail, it will be output before creating the random_seed file.
and this message disappears when turn-off UAC from Vista's control panel.
static void
slow_gatherer_windowsNT(void (*add)(const void*, size_t, int), int requester )
    (snip)
            status = RegQueryValueEx (HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA, "Global", NULL,
                                      NULL, (LPBYTE) pPerfData, &dwSize);
            if (status == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
    (snip)
            }
            else {
                g10_log_debug ( "rndw32: get performance data problem\n");
                break;
            }
Under the environment with UAC on Vista, it will be refused to access HKEY_PERFORMACE_DATA even if user has administrator privilege. I think this is not serious problem, because a random_seed is made from
another part.
Is this right?
