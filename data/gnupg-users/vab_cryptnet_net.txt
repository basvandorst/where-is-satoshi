@_subject: duplicate keyid survey results 
I checked code into CVS that will allow CKS to support HKP style queries by the 64 bit key ID, the full 128 bit v3 fp, or the full
160 bit V4 fp.  This feature will be available in the next release.
Here are adapted HKP protocol examples:
32 bit key ID:
GET /pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x992A4B3F HTTP/1.0
64 bit key ID:
GET /pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xFA920973992A4B3F HTTP/1.0
128 bit key ID (v3) (one line wrapped by MTA):
GET /pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0A75834DE6AB89F6BE869EB81DF4E517 HTTP/1.0
160 bit key ID (v4) (one line wrapped by MTA):
GET /pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0EC8B0E3052DFC4C208F76EBFA920973992A4B3F I included fp support, because I would like to soon write PGP software that uses fp's to transmit key information in other
protocols. It would be nice to use CKS to auto fetch by fp as
part of that code.

I don't believe this is true.  While the potential to create 32 bit key id collisions easily exists in v3, it is a hard problem in v4
because the v4 keyid (both 32 and 64 bit) are part of the fingerprint
which in v4 is the SHA160 hash of the key material. So, the problem of generating fake keys with a given keyid in v4 is the problem of looking for SHA1 partial collisions.
While partial collisions will occur as the number of keys grows, it will not be growing fast enough to result in an inability to retrieve
all keys with a given 32bit ID from a server for many decades (even
if you dedicate a machine to generating PGP keys and sending them to
my key server). V. Alex Brennen

In functionality, yes.  But in security... well...  IMHO, it's ok to
just throw v3 people to the wolves - they know what they're using is not secure, that it is attackable, in many different ways.  The
fixes for the insecurities in v3 are what became part of v4.
People really need to upgrade and stop using anything earlier than
v4.  Trying to secure v3 is like trying to secure Windows 98 as an
internet server.
LDAP has a max results modifier on queries, I encourage people to code something similar into keyservers to protect against server side DOS's rather than return a warning or partial
