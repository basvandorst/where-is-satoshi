oh yes - I had cipher-algo cast5 in options file...
you need both  --digest-algo md5 --cipher-algo cast5
it is not possible to detect digest and cipher algos
from PGP 2.x conventionally encrypted files,
only way is to try all cipher algos in row

if you want it decrypteable by 2.6.3.i you should

RFC2440 (and bis04 too) allows subkeys to have preferences (see 12.1.)
I can even send you a key with preferences in subkey binding signature.
but I think these preferences are ignored by PGP/GPG

why are you doung this?
"RANLIB=ranlib ./configure" is enough.
(IIRC "--enable-static-rnd=egd" is very bad idea (on windows))
it will print some error about missing libraries,
but just type "make" again (several times) and it will compile just fine.
btw, it's also possible to compile gnupg with MSVC, see Disastry   <----PGP plugins for Netscape and MDaemon

Hash: RIPEMD160
ELG sign/encrypt keys is not supported by PGP (except 658ckt06)
unlike GPG, PGP does not allow to select to which subkey to encrypt,
PGP always encrypts to newest one.
I'm not sure, but I think GPG will sign with subkey by default if there is one.
it's enough with signing subkeys.
but again PGP cannot verify signatures made with subkeys
(except 658ckt07 and maybe 7.x(but I'm not sure about it))
yes. normally.
different passprase can also be set (at least with 658ckt06),
I think it's wery cool furture :)
GPG also can use different passprase for key and subke(s),
but it's difficult to set different passprases with GPG,
for example, if you have 2 subkeys, you have to:
export to file0
delete subkey 2
set passphrase 1
export to file1
delete key
import from file0
delete subkey 1
set passphrase 2
export to file2
delete subkey 2
set passphrase 0
import from file1
import from file2
wipe file0, file1, file2
now the key will be protected with passprase 0, subkeys with passprases 1 and 2 :)

note that this FAQ was written when there was only v3 RSA keys.
RSA keys have some advantages, at least two:
 they are not limited to 1024 bits like DSA
 they can use hash longer than 160 bits.

@_subject: some(!) PGP / GPG compatibility question 
Hash: RIPEMD160
there is bug in PGP 7 that it uses old style checksum (or something) on RSA v4 key :/
(I may be wrong)
do not use (only) IDEA with DH keys - if you do it will be incompatible with GPG.
IDEA is needed for compatiblity with PGP 2.6, but DH/DSS keys
are incompatible with 2.6 anyway,
PGP normally encrypts to newest subkey.
786 bit (not byte ;-) ) subkey probably is the oldest one,
but it may be good idea to revoke this subkey anyway.
for example:
pgp.surfnet.nl (alias wwwkeys.nl.pgp.net, keys.pgpi.net)
blackhole.pca.dfn.de (alias wwwkeys.de.pgp.net)
you can do all of this,
of course add name, and sign new key before you revoke - PGP will not
allow to add name to revooked key and sign with revoked key.
you can also sign this name with new key.
with PGP admin, but it's not good idea (IMHO)
there is more chance that you will forgot password for other key,
it's much easer to forget the password that is not frequently used.
but you can write your passphrase to file and encrypt that file to other key.

Hash: RIPEMD160
this is not good idea, and even if you did it wouldn't help - if the key have multiple subkeys, and you encrypt to that key,
message is encrypted to only one of these subkeys, normaly to newest one.
some time ago I added key to another as subkey as an experiment
(with hex editor and hacked PGP6.5.8), so it is possible,
but there are several problems, most important of them is
that original key and key converted to subkey cannot coexist
in the same keyring, at least not in PGP,
some PGP versions chrashed when I tried to import both,
others didn't crashed, bot imported only one of keys.
(I didn't tried to import both keys in GPG..)

not by default.
6.5.8 uses CAST5 or 3DES for RSA v3 keys _only_ if IDEA is disabled.
with 2.6.3ia-multi06 you can use CAST5 and other ciphers too..
6.5.8ckt shows the cipher that was used to encrypt secret key.
they need IDEA module too, normally
