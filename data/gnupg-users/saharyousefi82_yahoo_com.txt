============================== START ==============================
I'm working on asymmetric keys for encryption and decryption of files. I am going to encrypt data on sender PC using receiver's public key and send encrypted data to receiver in order to decrypt it using its private key.
?I have two PCs (A and B). I created a (public key, private key) on A and sent its public key to B. the public key is attached. Then I tried to encrypt a dir using "gpgdir" command. But I encountered below error. I'm wondered why gpg is looking for A's private key? Whenever we don?t want B knows the private key? How can I fix it?
# gpgdir --verbose -K el_ghasemi at yahoo.com -e /home/yousefi/Desktop/a

It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named
in the user ID.? If you *really* know what you are doing,
you may answer the next question with yes.
Use this key anyway? (y/N) y
