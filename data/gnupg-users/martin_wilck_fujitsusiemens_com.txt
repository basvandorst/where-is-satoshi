@_subject: dirmngr SASL support 
I am trying to use dirmngr to download certificates from an AD server. Unfortunately the server accepts only SASL/GSSAPI bind operations. This is apparently unsupported in the current dirmngr (more precisely, dirmngr seems to support simple authenticfication only).
Is  SASL support planned for dirmngr any time soon?
