Ahh, the climactic scene from the movie "Lord of the disks" where Frodo
BaGPGins drops the platters in Mount Doom.

@_subject: gpg vs. gpg2 and smartcards on OSX 
Hash: SHA1
I have a small issue with my smartcard (FSFE - OpenPGP card) on OSX.
gpg --card-edit lets me edit data on the card, while gpg2 --card-edit  does not.
In both cases, the card info is listed, but if I try to change any  settings, it only works with gpg:
Command> lang
Language preferences: en
gpg: 3 Admin PIN attempts remaining before card is permanently locked
If I try to do the same with gpg2, I run into trouble:
Command> lang
Language preferences: en
gpg: error setting lang: Permission denied
The versions I have installed are:
gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.8
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.9
Does anyone have any idea of why this could be?
Best regards,
