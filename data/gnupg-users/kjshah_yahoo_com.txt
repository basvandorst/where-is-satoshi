@_subject: GNUPG with Windows Hosting 
I am trying to see if I can use this product with my
remotely hosted site on a Windows 2K server. I don't have the ability to install applications on
the server since it is a shared host and would like to
know if I would be able to use GNUPG to encrypt files
on the server for downloading via FTP.
If this is possible, can I please be pointed to some
directions on how to do so. I read through the docs
and couldn't find this info.
