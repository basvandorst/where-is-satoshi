@_subject: Revoking duplicate keys? 
Hi everyone,
I'm trying to use GnuPG again after a few years of changing PCs, etc. I recently discovered a lot of keys under my email address j.r.ong on the public keyserver, but the secret keys were saved onto old PCs and disks I don't even have anymore. Is there any way I can revoke them? Or at least indicate to others that I don't use them anymore?
I've also been stupid and experimenting with a new GnuPG front end and accidentally created several key pairs for my email address, all on the same day *sigh*. These were uploaded to the public keyserver. How do I get rid of the pairs -- I've generated a revocation certificate, is it enough just to paste the key revocation certificate in the "Add PGP Key" section of a keyserver? And do I just do gpg --delete-key  to rid it from my keyring for good? Sorry if these are all stupid questions - I feel stupid but I should have RTFM first! (I've been through Googlesearch and the GnuPG documentation but have no idea how to do the above). Sorry for wasting bandwidth!
Thanks to anyone who can help....
