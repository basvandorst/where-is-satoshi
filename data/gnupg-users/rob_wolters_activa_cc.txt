@_subject: importing private keys 
I currently run pgp 8.1 on my Windows desktop and would like to install
gnupg on my Unix server.  When I do this, will I be able to import my
keypair from PGP into gnupg so that I don't have to create a new private
and public key?  I've looked through the documentation and can't seem to
find an answer.
