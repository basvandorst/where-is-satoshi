@_subject: problem with PGP 7 public key 
i have a problem importing the attached PGP 7 public key.
all attempts result in
    gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
    gpg: Total number processed: 0
i'm using GnuPG 1.0.6.
i poked around the list archive, but there seems to
be little information on PGP 7 public key issues.
i'm using the options
    force-v3-sigs
    compress-algo 1
    cipher-algo cast5
    rfc1991
but somehow i believe that they don't influence the
process of importing a foreign public key.
any help will be appreciated.
thx & cheers,

i tried various option combinations (openpgp, rfc1991), but
still i can't import or list the public key. what did you try
to find out that it was a v4 RSA key? all i get is
    $ gpg --import key
    gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
    gpg: Total number processed: 0
gpg lists RSA as a supported pubkey algorithm.
my options file:
    no-greeting
    default-key 95579F92
    escape-from-lines
    lock-once
    honor-http-proxy
    force-v3-sigs
    compress-algo 1
    cipher-algo cast5
    no-secmem-warning
