@_subject: packet syntax 
I'm trying to learn the pgp packet syntax. I created a new key with gpg2 --gen-key and then gpg2 --export > pubkey.key and then gpg2 --dearmor pubkey.key. Which left me with a pubkey.key.gpg file. I then did a hexdump of the file and the first word is `99' which in binary would be `10011001'. I was expecting to encounter `11000110'.? I'm thinking that perhaps I have missed something simple and just need a nudge in the right direction.
Thanks in advance,

This is what I thought I was seeing, but thought I read somewhere that gpg creates version 4 packets.  Thanks.

Is it no longer possible to use egd? Most of the info I can find seems rather old, and so far I haven't been able to find a way to make it work. If it is still possible how do I do it.
Thanks in advance,

@_subject: [patches] add support for arc4random_buf() 
Please see attached patches to add support for arc4random_buf() as an alternate to /dev/{u}random. I tried to be as unobtrusive as possible and maintain style. It should also allow the user to still define RANDOM_CONF_ONLY_URANDOM if they would prefer to use /dev/urandom. This will allow gpg to be used on filesystems mounted nodev while providing quick, quality randomness.

The manual is probably the best source of information.
However, the tldr.
arc4random_buf() fills the buffer with nbytes of random data using the ChaCha20 cipher. It is thread safe. Every call stirs it more adding to it's randomness.

@_subject: How can we utilize latest GPG from RPM repository? 
Just to add a little extra. Say you have 12 machines. Use one as your build box and just build and install to a fake root tar it up and untar it on the rest of the machines. Make a few simple scripts to keep track of what files are associated with each "package" so you can easily delete them later. Most distros packaging systems are too difficult in my humble opinion. Plus you will get the software you want built to your needs.

That doesn't sound secure. Probably shouldn't use such programs on a server. Gpgme looks to do everything that it needs to do. Can you specify a function it is missing? I think gpgme is the answer here as well. If you mean specifically a python interface to gpgme then it's probably up to a python developer to get that rolling.

I overlooked the configure switches. Got it working. The use case is for chroot'd programs that need it on a filesystem mounted nodev. I sent some patches awhile back to add arc4random_buf as the entropy gathering 'device'. Which I've been using with no problems since. And it's a little faster than going through the egd.

Which flavor? You will need to find out whatever the package manager is for whichever flavor of linux you are using. You will need root permissions either through su(1) or sudo(8).
Or you can download and compile yourself. It may be as easy as:
# ./configure && make && make install
