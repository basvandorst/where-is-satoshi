@_subject: can't handle public key algorithm 100 
Hash: SHA1
I'm trying to import a key into GPG and it's refusing to because it says =
can't handle algorithm 100.  Output is below:
gpg: WARNING: --honor-http-proxy is a deprecated option.
gpg: please use "--keyserver-options honor-http-proxy" instead
gpg: armor header: Version: PGP Personal Security 7.0.3
gpg: signature packet without keyid
gpg: can't handle public key algorithm 100
gpg: pub   512R/D690C063 2001-07-11   C.G. Gardiner gpg: key D690C063: skipped user ID 'C.G. Gardiner '
gpg: key D690C063: no valid user IDs
gpg: this may be caused by a missing self-signature
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:           w/o user IDs: 1
According to the URL below,  is reserved - and I cant see anything on=

net about anyone else having seen this.=20
As far as I'm aware the key is from a vanilla PGP 7.0.3 - but I'm looking=
 into=20
it in case there's any weird options there.
If anyone can shed any light on this it'd be appreciated :)
(oh, if it makes any odds, I'm using GPG 1.0.7 on Gentoo Linux and it say=
