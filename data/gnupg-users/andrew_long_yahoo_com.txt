@_subject: PGP/GPG confusing PGPDisk? 
This is a bit of-topic for this list but I thought I'd float it here before trying to get an answer out of Symantec.
Back in about JUne I created a (small) PGP disk using PGP Desktop for Mac. I never actually used it but it would mount itself on re-boots and was (apparently) there and available.
Since I installed the security update to Lion last week though, this disk refuses to mount and complains about having been encrypted with an incompatible cipher. I believe that it was created with AES256. OK so it's no great loss - there wasn't anything in it - I'll create a new one. Only every time I try this now I get the same error, no matter what algorithm I choose from the dropdown box (one of CAST5, AES256 and EME2-AES256).
I was wondering if it is possible/likely that, because I have both PGP & GnuPG installed on the same machine and keep copies of my public key on both the PGO keyservers & sks-keyserers that I might have introduced some confusion into the choices of algorithms available between the two different installations?
Anyone have any thoughts on how to diagnose/resolve the situation, please?
