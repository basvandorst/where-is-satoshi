Hello GnuPG-Users,
The "--list-secret-keys" command shows all secret keys but not the
Revoked or Disabled status. Is there a way from the command line to
show the status?

You should take a look at GPGrelay. It works with GPG and adds PGP
inlined and PGP/MIME support to Outlook or any Windows e-mail client.

DSN> How do you connect more than one POP and SMTP through GPGrelay?
Each POP port and SMTP port must have a unique port number that
matches what you have configured in your email client.

acct# smtp  pop3
1    32025  32110
2    33025  33025
These ports must match what's in you mail client. So for account 1,
the pop port in the mail client would be 32110 which would match the
pop port in GPGrelay then the remote port in GPGrelay would be 110
which is the normal pop port.
I'm not sure how high the port numbers can go. I tend to use lower
numbers and it works fine for me.
So the inbound POP data from your ISP would be:
==>Incoming mail==>GPGR port in 110/GPGR port out 6110==>
   Eudora port in 6110
For outbound smtp mail:
Eudora smtp port 625==>GPGR port in 625/GPGR port out 25==>ISP
If you have a second account it must have different port numbers
assigned and not match the 6110/625 used above.
The "Remote Port" field in GPGR's Relay Configuration Screen for POP and
SMTP should be 110/25 as these can be shared and be the same for each
account. The Local Port field must be unique and different for each
Pardon the lousy schematic. I'm no artist. Hopefully, you'll get the

I'm presuming that the ports for the first accounts POP and SMTP are
different than the second accounts POP and SMTP connections.
If that's the case, try using different port numbers for the second
connection. You aren't restricted as long as you don't used any ports
reserved for some other function.
For your second connection, make its POP 5510 and its SMTP 525. These
port numbers work here.
Keep your first account's port assignments the same as you have now
(port 32025/32110).

Hash: SHA1
Hello GnuPG-Users,
It looks like Andreas has been busy.
The change log below:
Version 0.955 ; release-date: 2004-Oct-22
* GPGrelay:
 o More Dialogs have now proper Parent/Child-Hierarchy to disable some
   unwanted Non- Modality (and proper positioning)
 o GPGrelay now always tries to keep selections in lists/trees when
   reloading keys
 o Revoked/Expired/Disabled Subkeys are now also shown in keyviews
  (still missing similar feature for primary keys)
 o Revoke UserID is now also available through GPGrelay-GUI
 o Untrusted UserIDs are now also grayed out in the Key-Displays
 o Advanced debug-compiler-define for deadlock-checking (very
   experimental, might not working as intended, have to find out :)) At
   least it helped to catch one deadlock-situation with
   GPGrelay-shutdown while being asked for a passphrase so it wasn't
   worthless effort... (Not active in Release-Builds! In case you suffer
   from GPGrelay hanging, you might want to give the debug-build a try!)
 o STARTTLS/STLS is now always defaulting to TLS-Connection as some
   servers abort connection with an SSL2-Hello and don't negotiate TLS
  (or did I simply miss something in the OpenSSL-Doc?)
 o Log Full Protocol does now also show the StartTLS-Chitchat.
 o Some small improvements with Logging (still quite slow for large
   mails when log full bodies is turned on)
 o GPGrelay isn't that picky about email-addresses anymore, so it will
   work with internal email-addresses like "user or simply
   "user". Nevertheless GPGrelay is matching full strings, so
   "user doesn't match with a fully given "user so
   basically this one is only useful for giving aliases to GPGrelay
   (doubt it's useful to have abbreviated emails inside userids).
 o The PhotoID-Display can now be resized
 o Changed some dialog-texts to have Mnemonics (underlined chars) now,
   so you can navigate a bit more easily with the keyboards by pressing
   "Alt+Mnemonic" (don't hesitate to tell me missing/duplicate ones;
   this came late and is a boring issue, so I guess I haven't checked
   all dialogs properly... Suggested to be incorporated in current and
   future translations too.)
 o --autoexportsettings is now also working when shutting down win2k
   (GPGrelay is now creating the .reg-file by itself instead of
   executing regedit.exe to export the entries)
 o Simple Password-Spy-Detection should alarm you when someone
   unauthorized (eg. Spyware or Backdoor) is trying to read a passphrase
   from a GPGrelay-Dialog
 o Better support of crippled keys: VerifyPassphrase doesn't only rely
   on a signing-(sub)key anymore.
 o Better handling of non-canonical lineendings from broken servers
 o Little GUI-Fix: Relay-Dialog with IMAP and SSL is now properly
   changing the default-ports.
 o Changed a few lines of code so GPGrelay will now compile directly
   with VC.NET 2003 -- to my surprise the run through VC.NET also
   revealed embarrassing misuse of some MFC-Macros, so this experiment
   was more than worthwhile!
* SMTP:
 o Hide BCC-Recipient introduced blank additional line
 o Some more troubles with "No secret primary Key" solved (should now
   work as intended) basically due to the fact that there is a way to
   fetch Usage-Flags for secret keys from GPG.
* POP3:
 o Disabled Nagle-Algorithm (send coalescing) for local->remote-relay.
 o Some more Line-Ending-Issues solved (fewer lines added/removed)
* IMAP:
 o There is nothing I'll do here ... who is willing to care for IMAP-code?

Occasionally the console session will display "subpacket of type 20 has

this message telling me and is it of any concern to me or the key owner?
