I have the problem that I cannot longer export my gnupg key as I always
get the following error message
# gpg --armor --export .gnupg/secring.gpg
gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=20)
gpg: WARNING: nothing exported
gpg: key export failed: invalid packet
# gpg --list-keys

OK, I think I misunderstood something.
Anyway, 'gpg --armor --export johannes.schmid which should do
the right the thing ends up with exactly the same error message.
And it seems like I have no really good backup availible, the error is
in all backups...
