@_subject: gnupg, keyservers and key revocation. 
I'm having trouble getting some keys revoked. I have no troubles
generating the revocation certificate. But getting it onto the servers
is beyond me. I've not been able to find anything usefull in the
documentation even though I have looked.
Anyone has the solution? Or is this something that can not be done
with gpg?
