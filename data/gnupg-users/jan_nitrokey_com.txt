Nitrokey Storage is a USB device which operates as a ?digital latchkey?
to protect your data and user accounts. It allows for the secure
encryption of emails, files and hard drives, secure login on the web and
contains encrypted mass storage. The encryption keys are stored securely
in the hardware at all times.
Nitrokey is made entirely in Germany and is 100% open-source and uses
100% open hardware.
It is also the first hardware worldwide with hidden storage, which
enables users to plausibly deny the existence of additional encrypted
data. This can be useful during border controls or similar threatening
The firmware and hardware of Nitrokey Storage have already been verified
by Cure59, a professional third-party security auditor.
Use Cases:
* Encryption of emails, hard drives, SSH, and other data. Secure keys
are protected by an integrated OpenPGP Card. Up to RSA 4096 bit is
* Secure login on the web and protection against identity theft via
one-time passwords.
* Secure transport and exchange of sensitive files via encrypted mass
storage (up to 64 GB). (AES-256 in CBC mode)
Our crowdfunding campaign just started and needs your support:
Also, please help promoting it.
Kind Regards,
Jan Suhr

All serious findings are fixed already. Look for the "Note" at the end
of each issue description.
This can be a hard requirement for enterprises and government
institutions. So it makes sense to inform about it. Whether this matters
to personal users is up to each individual decision.

Hi Peter,

2nd factors are usually not access protected at all e.g. may have a display (which allows funny hacks[1]). We introduced PIN-protection of OTPs as an optional feature because we don't have a physical button. If an attacker has physical access to replace the smart card, he could also press a hypothetical button or read a hypothetical display. The PIN isn't aiming to protect against physical attacks hence it's not in our threat model.
An ejection switch doesn't make any sense to me. Note that ejection switch could only be triggered if a card is ejected while the device is powered. Furthermore any pupil would be able to use a soldering iron to circumvent an ejection switch.
I agree
Right, not part of the threat model and keys can't be extracted. Also an ejection switch wouldn't help here because a card could be replaced while the device is powered off which renders and ejection switch Thank you. :-)

The key is stored in the card.
The (optional PIN protected and encrypted) OTP secrets are stored in the microcontroller's flash which is read-protected.

If the optional PIN protection for OTPs is enabled, replacing the smart
card would render the OTPs inaccessible.
