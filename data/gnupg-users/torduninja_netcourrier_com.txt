governments it can't be secure but a 192-bit level should still be safe,
according to a certain table of equivalences the equivalent is a
7680-bit RSA Anyway, I've recompiled GnuPG and made a more conventional large key to
keep him happy.

On Linux there's TinyCA to set up your own CA and issue e-mail or server
certcificates. Very simple to use.

for using gnupg with outlook ?
It's pretty simple if you get a good Windows front-end for GPG. With
GPGshell, for example, just use current window or clipboard functions to
encrypt/decrypt etc. I don't use WinPT but I believe it has the same
capability in this respect.

Hi all,
The notes on the "exec-path" option refer to "keyserver helpers". I assume that
the gpgkeys_ldap binary in the Windows distribution is one of these helpers. Is
this correct?

Thanks, David. Just one more precision if you would be so kind. I've just
noticed that the 1.3.6 Windows release has a binary (gpgkeys_hkp) which isn't
present in the 1.2.x releases. Is hkp keyserver support compiled into the gpg
binary in 1.2.x? If not, will 1.2.5 use the 1.3.6 binary?

The information on setting up the GPG TO GO portable GnuPG application on a floppy (or USB device) has been updated (
The major change is that we've found that a one-line batch script eliminates the need to copy M$ binaries to the floppy.
This eases the space problems posed by the iconv.dll in the 1.3.92 Windows version discussed on the list last month.
It also removes any legal obstacle to distributing GPG TO GO as a complete package, and there's now a download available which includes GnuPG-1.2.6 compiled for floppy use, with the default home directory A:\gnupg, and the binaries already compressed with upx.

On Mon, 9 Feb 2004  David Shaw wrote
This raises a point about compatability of GPG keys with PGP 8.x. The default compression preferences in GPG are Z2 Z1 (ZLIB ZIP) and decompression failures with GPG-encrypted messages were reported by PGP 8.0.3 users in a recent thread on the PGP-Basics list.
PGP keys have no compression (or hash) preferences as far as I can see by importing a PGP key and doing gpg --pref, so it seems GPG uses ZLIB even if PGP 8 can't handle it, and apparently has no way of finding from the PGP key that it shouldn't.

Thanks for the precision, David. That was my understanding of the situation, until recently I had this problem occur in corresponding with a PGP 8 user whose key was definitely PGP-created. All my messages failed to decrypt because of a decompression failure. When I changed the preferences on my key, putting ZIP first, the problem disappeared.
The thread I cited was started by a user of both GPG and PGP who had imported his GPG key into PGP without changing the preferences, but  the same problem was reported in the thread by an organisation which  used only PGP. Strange.

I doubt very much that the problem lies there. The only changes from defaults
in my Windows gpg configuration file concern the location of my private
keyring and s2k cipher and hash, and I never use overriding options except
for PGP6 compliance.
Unfortunately I no longer have the messages but I'll try to reproduce the
problem if my correspondent is willing, and I'll pass it on.

A word or warning for Windows users: this is apparently an example of the
latest ploy of the virus writers. The virus comes in an encrypted zip file
to avoid detection by AV programs, and apparently from a trustworthy source
such as your ISP (or Werner).

There were two reasons I included cmd.exe (NT systems) or command.com (all
Windows systems ) on the GPG TO GO floppy.
The first was simply to avoid leaving traces of their usage in the Start > Run history, but the second reason may have some bearing on this thread. MS-DOS assumes that all files are
located in the working directory, so if you're in A: (the floppy) it assumes everything is on the
floppy and there's no need to include the path to the files you want to encrypt or decrypt.
However, the GnuPG home directory is an exception to this rule and you have to specify its
location in the command line even when it's on the floppy. I assume that this exceptional behaviour is coded into the gpg binary. I considered working on the code to change this
default home directory location to the floppy, but that wouldn't help those using GPG TO GO
on a USB stick, so I left it as it was.
One thought that occurs to me is to install the binaries and gpg.conf in the same directoy as cmd.exe (or command.com) so that gpg could pick up locations of keyrings etc from the
configuration file (which would be the default "home"). But this is "Windows-think" and might cause more problems than it solves,considering gpg is designed for cross-platform compilation
and Windows is bottom of the list of priorities.
In any case, for those who have problems creating registry keys to use GPG on work machines,
GPG TO GO is a viable solution.

Personally, I find no problem at all. I was simply looking for a way to make
the command line exactly the same as in regular gpg use.
In fact, your second suggestion is what is used in GPG TO GO.

Unlike a floppy, which has a dedicated drive letter, the drive letter for USB sticks
will vary according to disk partitioning, and in any case it don't think it will be A :
even if your machine has no floppy drive.
It does that already, in fact, concerning the location of the gpg default home directory.
Actually, my reasoning for not pursuing the change in the code for GPG TO GO
on a floppy seems no longer valid. Since my earlier post in this thread I've had
a look at the Windows version of 1.3.92 and it's  too big for a floppy. With the best
upx compression, the gpg.exe binary is almost 100kb larger than that of 1.2.5 and it
requires the iconv.dll which is more than 600kb - a total of 700kb extra. A bare-bones
version will just fit on the floppy, but there's virtually no room for files to encrypt or
So it looks like GPG TO GO using 1.4 is reserved for USB sticks, and the floppy
version will have to stay with the latest 1.2.x release.
 GPG TO GO was conceived as a replacement for PGP 2 for people living in
nasty places where using encryption can sometimes get you killed, or worse.
It's designed to leave no trace on the host machine that encryption has taken
place and to be used on public machines, which in the vast majority run
Windows systems.
But from the feedback I've received, it fills the need of  many people who
have the problem of using GPG on work machines where they don't have the rights
to install, and Linux users could fall into this category . I've never seen a Linux
distribution that doesn't include GPG, but no doubt there are some installations
where it's not installed. I don't have a floppy drive on my Linux machine so I can't verify it , but if you
put the gpg binaries and gpg home directory files on a floppy, replace A: by fd0,
then you should be able to cd to the floppy and use the same commands as in
the Windows version. NetCourrier, votre bureau virtuel sur Internet : Mail, Agenda, Clubs, Toolbar...

This version has the recent cipher and hash algorithms  added
and can generate larger keys, which in theory make it more secure. I say "in
theory" because I strongly doubt that the implementations of these changes have had the same level of peer review that GnuPG has had, and I'm not sure
that they've had very much at all.
But the issue of compatibility was also a  factor in the conception of GPG TO
GO.   NetCourrier, votre bureau virtuel sur Internet : Mail, Agenda, Clubs, Toolbar...

This doesn't seem to be the case.  My tests of running 1.3.92 on a floppy without the
iconv.dll on the machine or the floppy showed that gpg couldn't access the key
rings, and logically couldn't encrypt or decrypt anything.
Any command which involves access to the key rings gives the error message
gpg: error loading 'iconv.dll' ec:126
and then gpg stops.
That indeed solves the problem, but whether it's possible to write to rhe usual
DLLPATH on a public machine is another matter.
