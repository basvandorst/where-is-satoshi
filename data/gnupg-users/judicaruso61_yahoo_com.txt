@_subject: Help with downloading GnuPG 
I am taking an IT class and learning about encryption. We were given instructions to download the add on for Thunderbird/Windows Vista  - GNUPG/Enigmail. Everywhere I have search has lead me to   where I don't understand how to download in the binary fashion or what that means.. in terms of this program. I do not see a download button to click.   I am sure it is something easy but I don't see it could you help me get started with a download for my computer...
Thank You
