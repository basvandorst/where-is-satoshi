@_subject: PGP 6.5.3 reports bad signature on GnuPG signed files/mails 
I'm beginning to use GnuPG on Win2k instead of PGP 6.5.3. I successfully
imported my keyrings and figured how tow work it on the commandline. Now a
little problem occurred:
If I sign something with GnuPG (1.0.6) and then verify it with PGP, PGP
reports a bad signature (it decrypts ok). Is this a feature or am I missing

I need to test that. Funnily enough though: I just ran the same
procedures, with the same keyring and the same version of gpg (1.0.6)
and files encrypted and signed are accepted by PGP 6.5.3 fine with no
'bad signature' remarks. So it seems to be a Windows issue. I wonder
whether this can just be ignored...
