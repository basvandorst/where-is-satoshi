@_subject: =?utf-8?Q?Import_Certificate_into_Kleopatra/Decrypt_Message?= 
Dear Sir/Madam,
Recently, I have installed GnuPG for Windows 8.1. I have made a public key (personal Open PGP keypair). I have sent the public key to one of my contacts and he had send me his public key. When I try to import his certificate in Kleopatra, the public key cannot be processed. Currently, I have the signature & encrypted file stored in my Documents. Also, I have tried to decrypt a message that he has sent me through the Plugin for Outlook (GpG Ol) - but it gave me the message that the verification cannot be processed. I have followed the guide step-by-step, but I cannot quite figure out what I am doing wrong.
Could someone assist me with this?
