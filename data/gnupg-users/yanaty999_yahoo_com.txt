@_subject: unable to preset passphrase 
I need to automate the porcess of receiving an decrypting files encrypted with a gpg key.
Since this is supposed to be an unattended process I need to? preset a passphrase.
I run the statement (from a batch file):
gpg2 --fingerprint --fingerprint
pub 2048R/79949D47 2012-04-05
Key fingerprint = 2E9E EC17 61C1 CFB9 1B67 9A17 388C CF06 7994 9D47
uid MyName? sub 2048R/802FB4D8 2012-04-05
Key fingerprint = 56E0 6E3E 911D 2E48 5189 CAF0 87ED 5DCF 802F B4D8
What am I doing wrong?
Thank you, -
