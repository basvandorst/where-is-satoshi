@_subject: A PC user unfamiliar with any free software would like to send me 
Unfamiliar with *any* free software? That does pose a problem, especially
if neither of you are willing to try to learn. There are countless GPG
tutorials and blog posts out there, not to mention this list's archives.
The simplest thing I could think of would be something like this:
It's an extension for Google Chrome (which is free software though, so
perhaps this "PC user" is not familiar with it?) that does basic symmetric
encryption with no special setup. Personally, I can't imagine using it
myself unless I was on a Windows box with no time to install & configure
GPG, but I do know people who use it (people who found GPG too
PS: I can't vouch for the quality of the encryption (I haven't looked at
the implementation) or the general safety of it (I don't know if it
performs the encryption locally or if it sends it to a server).

@_subject: gpg for pseudonymous users [was: Re: gpg for anonymous users - 
I wouldn't have to work at Red Hat to find your imagining of all this
hilarious. No offense meant.
What makes the most sense: that all packages are built on a handful of
central build servers (individual maintainers building packages?
seriously?) on a private network and that as part of that automated build
process, the packages are signed. And then of course yes, some sort of
manual process to push packages out to publicly-accessible servers for
Also, for the record, you're wrong about "with extremely few exceptions,
they do not do enhancements: those are delayed until the next major release
up to 18 months later". Most packages will stay at the same upstream
version for the life of a RHEL major release, but feature-enhancements
still happen all the time with minor releases (every 6 months) and
sometimes even sooner. (Also, new major releases don't happen every 18

@_subject: Fwd: need help for GPG 1.2.1 binary for REHL 5.8 
RHEL5 ships with a newer version of GPG, namely v1.4.5 (even RHEL 5.0
shipped with that). RHEL 5.4 and above also ship with v2.0.10.
Sorry for not answering your query, but please tell me: Why in the world
would you want to use an an older less-secure version?

@_subject: New GUI frontend for windows 
I appreciate your sentiment but I absolutely agree with what everyone else
has said. Expecting people to use closed-source crypto software in 2013
would be a little like expecting people to only buy their music (contained
in a limited-life wasteful physical container like a CD) in-person at a big
chain store.. or to only rent movies in-person at Blockbuster -- namely,
unrealistic at best.
And as you might have guessed after the first few comments: I can tell you
right now you're not going to get anyone subscribed to this list to try it.

@_subject: feedback on a gpg encryption/signing GUI frontend 
Hash: SHA512
Hey folks. From January to February of last year I wrote a GnuPG/OpenSSL
encryption & signing frontend for Linux (Python + GTK) called pyrite
( and I'd like to share it with you.
Soon after "completing" pyrite (there's always more to do when you
have a project you love, but there was nothing else urgent) I got a job
working at Red Hat and have been insanely busy ever since. Last week I
had to teach a mini-class on encryption ... it reminded me how much I
love this stuff and well, here I am. Time to pick this project back up
and make sure that anyone out there who could find use in it actually
has a chance to.
If your interest is at all piqued, know that there are screenshots up on
Github, as well as details for system requirements. If you're thinking
to yourself "aren't there other gpg frontends out there?" well... take
a look at how it all went down in this post [
on askfedora.
Any feedback welcome. Cheers.

Robert is correct that the usual way people run gpg is by passing it
input via a pipe or from a file; however, what you're aiming for is
totally doable. The missing piece you need is the keyboard shortcut:
Ctrl-d, e.g.:
[rsaw:~]$ gpg -ac
Enter passphrase:
Repeat passphrase:

Also Len: if you're looking for a Linux gpg gui to do these kinds of
things, I would recommend Pyrite (
I'm partial of course, since I wrote it.

I recommend you follow up on the suggestions about password managers;
however, if you are dead-set on managing your own encrypted flat file and
you want a GUI, pyrite (
) is by far your best choice.

I have no idea how much work it would require. No one's ever expressed an
interest, myself included.

@_subject: GPG (v. 1.4.12) is not user-friendly 
I disagree with your subject, and propose that you google for a tutorial
since the man page clearly didn't work for you.
(As far as I can tell, you were trying to import someone's pubkey, in which
case you should simply have used: gpg --import FILE)

@_subject: Looking for simple wrapper for symmetric key file encryption 
As already mentioned, you could decrypt the file to a ram disk -- the
bypass creating an unnecessary file altogether, you need something
I actually wrote a GUI frontend for this purpose (among others) a
while back. It's called pyrite and available at:
It's extremely versatile and can do everything but manage keys --
basically you can do any kind of signing & verifying with or without
any kind of encryption/decryption (including symmetric).
Your workflow with it could look like this:
1.)  Run pyrite /path/to/encrypted/file
      [GUI opens up with text-input populated by encrypted text]
2.) Decrypt text
      [Cipher-text is replaced with decrypted version; never saved to disk]
3.) Make your edits/changes
4.) Re-encrypt
5.) Click save-to-disk button

@_subject: Symmetric encrypt many files (batch mode) 
Assuming you want to encrypt every single file in a directory tree, your
best bet would be to use the find command. Something like this:
find /SomeDirectory -type f -exec gpg2 --batch --cipher-algo AES256
--force-mdc --symmetric --passphrase-file /FILE -o {}.gpg {} \;
The above will save each file with the same name + an extension of ".gpg".
The cipher-algo & force-mdc options aren't required of course. Just a
personal recommendation.
