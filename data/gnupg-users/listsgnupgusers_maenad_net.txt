That's the value of '--export-secret-key nori', yes ... oh, i hoped something like that hadn't happened ... i don't understand
how it could have, as i didn't rename files or anything!
in all the backups i have, the output of the above command looks the
what would i be looking for?  something that said "private key
packet"?  if so, should i just make a backup directory, go through,
and rename everything in in secring.gpg, and then try the command,
grepping for "private"?
thanks again,

nothing there.  damn.  i guess i have to give it up for lost, huh.
thanks anyway for your help!

so simple -- of course.  i'd forgotten to delete the old directory
with the corrupt keys.  :)
