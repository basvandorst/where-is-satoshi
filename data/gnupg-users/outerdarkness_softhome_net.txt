Hash: RIPEMD160
NOTE:  I'm sending this to two lists, so some of you may be getting
I'm in transition between PGP and GnuPG
I'm using:
PGP version 6.5.8 CKT build 08,
GnuPG version 1.2.1rc1-nr1 (nullify release),
GnuPG version 1.0.7-3
I'm running WIN98, and I've got CygWin version 1.3.13 installed.
PGP and GnuPG(1.2.1rc1-nr1) are installed under windows
GnuPG(1.0.7-3) is installed under CygWin
Because I'm in transition, I'm maintaining a separate keyring for
each of the three PGP/GPG programs, and I'm using either MS-DOG batch
files or BASH shellscripts to synchronize the keyrings.  The scripts
are set up such that each program handles exporting its own keyring
to a temporary file and importing the other programs' temporary files
into its own keyring.  I've also made absolutely certain that none of
this exporting/importing is done by two PGP/GPG programs at the same
I haven't checked where this has occurred, but I've noted that I have
been accumulating multiple self-signatures under my default key.
That is, with regards to my default key, I noticed the self-signature
for that key keeps getting added to the other self signatures until I
have three or four self-signatures.  I can easily delete the
extraneous self-signatures, but this is still bugging me.
POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
Under what circumstances can all three PGP/GPG programs share the
same keyring files?
Under what circumstances should the three PGP/GPG programs *not*
share the same keyring files?
MORE INFO?
Would it be helpful for me to export the public key in question?  If
so, I can post a URL for the thing.
Thank you for your time.

I had the unique pleasure of working for a small company in 1999-2000
where we were told that we *must* use encrypted email for certain
inter-company communications.
[then we were absorbed by a mega-corporation and mandatory encryption
was no more....]
