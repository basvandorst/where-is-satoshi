@_subject: a newbie question on passphrase to decrypt an encrypted file 
I installed gpg (win32) on my machine running NT. I generated my key with my
passphrase. When I encrypted a file, it asked me for the passphrase. But
when I decrypted it, it didn't ask me for the passphrase at all. This sounds
scary to me. I can't seem to find the answer from various documents. Don't
you have to type in your passphrase to decrypt a file?

Thanks! You are right. I was confused.

Since when one encrypts files, one doesn't need to to access the secret
key (and hence, enter a passphrase), I think what you did in the first
step was sign your message, not encrypt it.  Signing a message requires
access to your secret key.
Also, since verifying signed documents does not require access to your
secret key, I think that this is what you did in your second step.  That
is, you didn't decrypt, but rather verify a signature.
