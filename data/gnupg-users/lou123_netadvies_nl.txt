@_subject: Cannot decrypt with PGP 7.0.3 using PnuPG private key. 
Hello David,
Thank you for the advice. I am not yet getting it to work. I am doing the I generate a keypair: DSA and ElGamal, size 2048
gpg --homedir etc --simple-sk-checksum --edit-key logguard
gpg --homedir etc --export-secret-keys logguard > secring.new.gpg
I import the secring.new.gpg into PGP by dropping it into the PGPkeys window.
I sign and trust with my own key.
gpg.exe --homedir etc --recipient logguard --output g:\log.txt.pgp --encrypt g:\log.txt
I doubleclick the log.txt.pgp file and PGP prompts me to enter the passphrase for logguard.
I enter the passphrase for logguard and PGP will NOT decrypt it. I keep being prompted.
Am I doing something wrong?

@_subject: Cannot decrypt with PGP 7.0.3 using PnuPG private key. 
I am using GnuPG version 1.2.4 on Windows to encrypt logs. I also need to use the keypair that I generated with GnuPG in PGP 7.0.3. I successfully imported the private key into PGP.
However, if I try to decrypt a file that I have encrypted with GnuPG, it does not work. I was reading that PGP does not support ElGamal, but I cannot find any switch that allows me to create a keypair based on another algorithm.
Can somebody please help me?
Thank you in advance,
