As real name you have to enter something like "John Doe", nothing more.
Then GnuPG asks you for your email address. Here you enter something like "john.doe

Out of this three components GnuPG then builds a user id of the form:

I found this in the NEWS:
Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.0 -----------------------------------     * New option --escape-from-lines to "dash-escape" "From " lines to  If a MUA uses the mailbox format, i.e. a simple text file where all messages are stored one after the other a line starting with "From " is used to mark the start of the next message. There are a lot of MUAs which use the mailbox format, for example Netscape Messenger, KMail and also Pine and Mutt.
Now if a line inside a message starts with "From " it will be changed to ">From " by the MUA while receiving the mail. But this additional ">" would break the signature. Therefore PGP and GnuPG dash-escape the "From " if they clear-sign messages.
The reason why you never have seen a line beginning with ">From " might be because the MUA automatically removes the ">" before displaying the mail. The ">" can only be found in the mailbox file in which the message is stored.
I hope this clears things up.

True. But one doesn't need to intercept a message encrypted with this=20
persons public key if his key can be downloaded somewhere because then=20
it can be used for arbitrary known-plaintext attacks. So encrypting the=20
same message once to many people has no disadvantage compared to=20
encrypting the same message for each recipient separately.
Obviously every key is vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Only the=20
degree of vulnerability in terms of the average time needed for a=20
brute-force attack differs.
BTW, there are more sophisticated algorithms to crack assymmetric keys=20
than to crack symmetric keys because the mathematics of the assymmetric=20
encryption is much easier and much better understood nowadays. AFAIK,=20
nobody (apart of the NSA?) ever managed to really understand DES. The=20
only reason for its weakness is its restricted key size. And the=20
Rijndael algorithm (aka AES) is simply to new.
If elliptic curve algorithms would be used for assymmetric keys it would=20
all of a sudden become much more difficult to attack assymmetric=20
encryption. But this is also partly due to the fact that elliptic curve=20
algorithms aren't really understood very well (again only AFAIK). But=20
at least the GNFS wouldn't help you much in this case.
For n=3D512 I get O(...)=3D107.54... and for n=3D1024 I get O(...)=3D132.=
There must be something wrong with your formula for the complexity of=20
the GNFS algo.
But however, computer power doubles about every 1.5 years by "Moore's=20
law". log_2(200.000) is about 17.6. That means it will take about 25=20
years until the computer power has increased enough. Furthermore=20
significantly better factoring algorithms are also not very likely.=20
Maybe some constants (like the 1.923) can be improved a little bit. So=20
your few years are most likely at least 10 years.
BTW, distributed computing doesn't help much with the GNFS because the=20
large system of equations which is generated in the first step (which=20
_can_ be done via distributed computing) still has to be solved with=20
one (super-)computer. So only some very large corporations and secret=20
agencies will have enough power to crack asymmetric keys in the=20

Although this is true I don't think that any normal person will ever (in=20

Their seems to be a problem with the encoding. My user id also includes an 'ö'. I generated the key with GnuPG. gpg --list-keys gives me "Ingo Klöcker ..." as user id.
You could try gpg --list-keys --with-colons. Then the user id is printed in UTF-8 encoding. In UTF-8 the 'ö' becomes 'Ã¶'.
I just tried gpg --with-colons on the key data you included in your messages. This gives me "Peter Knöll ...". So the problem is that PGP saved the 'ö' as 'ö' instead of saving the UTF-8 representation of it. It seems that PGP 7.0 is not RFC2440 compliant.

Hi Neko!
There's no need to apologize for anything
Have you tried if there is a difference if you choose one key or the A fresh GnuPG key consists of two keys. The primary key is mainly for signing and the secondary (sub) key is for encryption. If you now want to send you public key to someone you export this key (preferrably in an ascii armor). For this use 'gpg --export --armor' followed by your user id or the key id (prepended by 0x if the key id starts with A-F). I just tried exporting my key with the key id of the primary key and the key id of the secondary key. As I had expected both times exactly the same was exported, that is the whole key with all sub keys and all signatures (except those which are marked as local of course).
So I think it doesn't matter if you choose the key marked as 's' or the key marked as 'e'. But to be sure you should try it out.

Yes, you'll need two distinct key pairs for this. Different user IDs on a key pair are more or less simply aliases. If you export your public key to send it to someone all user IDs are included.
Unfortunately KMail currently only supports one (global) PGP user ID. Therefore you'll have to change the (global) PGP user ID everytime according to the key pair you want to use. Different PGP user IDs for different KMail identities will (very likely) be supported in an upcoming version of KMail.

Hash: SHA1
This is of course due to bad message handling (and because many Windows MUAs weren't designed to work with PGP/GnuPG). IMHO the right way of doing it is as follows:
1.) You write your message.
2.) You hit the send button.
2.a) Optionally the MUA wraps the message.
2.b) The message is clearsigned (as it is, no wrapping here).
2.c) The message is sent.
3.) The receiver gets the message.
4.) The receiver reads the message.
4.a) The signature is verified.
4.b) Now the message is wrapped for viewing.
Two problems could occur:
2.a happens after 2.b
This is as I already said due to MUAs which lack real PGP/GnuPG integration and where you have to use a plugin or some external program to sign the message before you hit the send button.
=> This problem might be circumvented by making PGP/GnuPG wrap the message. But it would be better if the plugin or external program which works as "connection" between the MUA and PGP/GnuPG would take care of this (and you already mentioned that GnuPGShell actually does it).
4.a happens after 4.b
This is also due to MUAs with a bad or no PGP/GnuPG integration.
=> This problem can't be circumvented because there will always be someone who wraps the lines after less characters than you thought, i.e. people who are visually impaired and who therefore use very large I totally agree with Johan.
I disagree. If you want to make sure that nothing happens to the text once it's been signed you can't use clearsigning. Or you should use another MUA.
MUAs with a good integration of PGP/GnuPG (like KMail for example ;-)) sign the message after it's been formatted.
So this problem only occurs with MUAs which weren't designed to work with PGP/GnuPG.

Normally this is caused by messages where hard returns are used to wrap the lines for example at column 70 but then the receiver looks at it with a maximal width of for example 64 columns. If it would have been transmitted in one long line everything would be perfect. That's one of the few advantages of HTML messages. They look always good regardless of the use of hard returns or no returns at all.
Using hard returns to wrap the lines manually or automatically will always cause the message to look like above for some people (who use a small maximal width for the mail reader).
That's bullshit. Non-fixed-width fonts are much more legible. Or why else are almost all book nowadays printed with proportional fonts instead of fixed-width fonts? Additionally, in general the overall appearance of a mail is as good as with a fixed-width font. Only some signatures sometimes look a bit weird (especially those ascii images).
BTW, although I use a proportional font I have no problem with hard returns because my MUA takes care of this.
The problem is not that Netscape wraps the long lines to make them better legible (which is IMHO a very nice thing because it avoids the need to scroll the mail sideways to read some long lines which were sent by some stupid MUAs). The problem is that Netscape (at least < 6) has no PGP/GnuPG integration. In order to check a signed mail you have to either copy and paste it to some other GnuPG frontend which then verifies the signature or you have to save the message and then verify the signature manually. The latter should be O.K. but the first will lead to wrong signatures if the message has been wrapped by Netscape. IIRC one can turn off this automatic wrapping of long lines.

You know ME. ;-) And I know a lot of people who use KMail. But you are right. The problem are all those MUAs for Windows which have all kinds of fancy features but lack something useful like a good integration of PGP/GnuPG. The people having trouble with these MUAs should really contact the producers of those MUAs and demand a decent support of However, I don't think word wrapping should be implemented in GnuPG. IMHO that's the plug-ins' job. But as I'm not involved in the development of GnuPG it's not up to me to decide.
BTW, KMail calls GnuPG to do signing, encrypting, decrypting etc. Why can't (Windows) plug-ins do the same for PGP? You don't need any source code for this. All you need is a documentation of the command line

If you don't want gpg to search the server for a key you should turn this option of.
OTOH, we could use the --no-auto-key-retrieve option in KMail.
So I forwarded it there.
Running gpg in the background makes IMHO no sense if KMail tries to verify the signature of a message or tries to decrypt a message because KMail simply can't procede before gpg has returned.
Hmm, now that I think about it, it might actually make sense for signed messages. As long as gpg hasn't verified the signature we could simply display the message as not yet verified. And if gpg finally returns we could change the displayed message according to the status of the signature. The only problem is that I currently have no idea how hard this would be to implement.
If you selected another message the verification of the last message would have to be canceled. Also it would make sense to cache the verification status so that signed messages don't have to be verified everytime you select them.

I guess this is caused by the different ways to encode the line endings:
Unix =3D DOS =3D And you are right. The culprit is PGP. According to the OpenPGP Message=20
Format Specification (RFC 2440bis-03):
   As with binary signatures on text documents, a cleartext signature

This means that even if the line endings are represented by  only=20

Do the following for each email address/UID on the key:

A variant of your approach would be to do the following:

  sign the UID;
  encrypt the signed key to itself;
  mail the encrypted key to the email address in the signed UID;
  delete the signature again from the UID;
Unfortunately this is always the problem with the web of trust. But if=20
nobody (except your "goofball non-OpenPGP-understanding friends" ;-) )=20

True. But only the key owner can add another (possibly malicious) UID to=20

It would be dangerous for you to re-upload your key with an additional=20

                 signatures only on key  material.   This  option
                 forces v3 signatures for signatures on data.
Obviously PGP 6.5.8 also can't handle v4 signatures.

after compiling and installing GnuPG 1.0.7, running 'gpg=20

                f =3D The key is full trusted.
                u =3D The key is ultimately trusted; this is only used for
                    keys for which the secret key is also available.
I'm mainly asking because programs which parse the --with-colon output=20
need to be updated to take the '-' into account.
The '-' probably means that no trust path (from one of my ultimately=20
trusted keys) leads to this key and therefore the trust can't be=20
calculated. Is this correct?
If yes, then why isn't 'q' used? Or does 'q' mean there is a path from=20
an u.t. key to this key but at least one key on the path lacks the=20
owner trust value.
If this is the case, then why 'o' isn't used? Is 'o' still used? I never=20
saw it on a key.
Last but not least, the description of 'u' in doc/DETAILS is outdated as=20
'u' is no longer automatically used for complete key pairs.

@_subject: making it easy to find keys 
If a subkey was used to sign a message then there's no way to determine the primary key id. Not all keyservers support looking for keys by the key id of a subkey.
Note: For RSA v3 keys KeyID and Fingerprint are not related.

@_subject: feature request: allowing display of session key used for 
--throw-keyid ? Sure it throws away the key id of all encryption keys. But if you want anonymity then that's what you want to use because you won't have to keep track of any session keys.

@_subject: list problem 
You are confusing PGP/MIME (as defined in RFC 3156 "MIME Security with OpenPGP") with S/MIME. All occurrences of S/MIME in your message have to be replaced with PGP/MIME. S/MIME is something completely different (well, not completely different but still different enough).
For what it's worth, at least KMail (with plugin) and Mutt (at least the special version of the Aegypten project using the same plugin as KMail) can also handle S/MIME. The old Netscape email client also used to know S/MIME. I don't know about Mozilla or Evolution.

@_subject: Migrating keys 
Yes, the other key could belong to someone else who happens to have the same name as you. And the email addresses probably also don't prove much since the average lifespan of freemail addresses (I didn't have a look at your key so maybe this doesn't apply to your key) is rather FWIW, I wouldn't sign your new key.

@_subject: MUA questions 
^^^
That's very funny because your own reply answers this question. See above. In your reply Ralph's Euro symbol (?) has been converted to something really strange (because obviously your pine wasn't able to decode the utf-8 encoded symbol correctly). This misinterpretation could easily have broken an inline signature. Luckily Ralph used a PGP/MIME signature. This way the message is first encoded (== converted from 8-bit to 7-bit) and then the encoded 7-bit text is signed preventing any problems that might be caused by misinterpreted 8-bit

@_subject: Newbie: Choosing a user ID questions 
Leaving the email address out of the key makes sense for certification keys, i. e. key which are exclusively used to sign other keys. For keys which are used to sign messages and for keys which should be used for encryption this doesn't make sense.
In this case KMail asks which key should be used and, optionally, it remembers the choice of the user so that he won't be asked again when sending an encrypted message to the same address. Additionally automatic encryption of messages to recipients for which there is an OpenPGP key will then work even with email addresses that are not listed in the OpenPGP key.
What will the MUA do in case two or more keys correspond to name A good MUA will pass the key id instead of the user id to gpg to specify the recipients.

@_subject: Are .ems attachments necessary? 
.ems attachments? Those are probably messages with detached signatures (aka PGP/MIME). Unless you tell us message from which senders contain ".ems attachments" we can't answer this question for sure. Does my message which is PGP/MIME signed have a ".ems attachment"?
If Eudora really can't handle PGP/MIME messages then I suggest to use another mail client. The other Windows users on this list will surely be able to suggest a better mail client.

Yeah, in a perfectly RFC compliant world there would be no 8-bit problem. But in the real world there are still buggy MTAs that remove the 8th bit from 8-bit messages.

Well, apparently it's not the signatures that are shown as attachments but the messages. OTOH, my message was just a wild guess. So it might be something else than PGP/MIME messages that cause the confusion.

Yeah, let's make all people on the world use the 26 Latin characters. Why would anyone need umlauts, accents, Greek letters, Cyrillic letters, Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana, or any other character set?

I just want to remark that any MIME-compliant (RFCs 2045-2048) email client is able to display multipart/signed messages correctly. Outlook Express is not MIME-compliant (which is the main reason why the deprecated clearsigning is still used nowadays). And at least Eudora 5.1 also seems to have problems with MIME-compliance.

Did you notice that you contradict yourself? In the first paragraph you complain that the message size grows significantly. And in the third paragraph you propose to use \alpha which is significantly larger than alpha in a Greek charset or even in Unicode.
Your attitude towards everyone who doesn't fit in your small 7-bit world sucks tremendously.

@_subject: trust problem 
I guess everything after the "[...], but" is not incorporated into the signature but is part of the local trust database. Correct? Now I wonder how I can specify "I only trust B enough to make people partially trusted and only for people at aol.com". Is it correct that the first part "partially trusted" can be achieved by assigning "marginal trust" to a key owner (gpg --edit-key trust)? How can I assign a regexp?

@_subject: filenames of encrypted attachments visible ? How hard would it 
Yes, it is. Just have a look at the header of Ivan's message:
X-PGP-KeyID: 0xA5BDD19856098673 (1024D)
I guess you tried to download a key with key id 0x0E002DCC33645A55. That's the key id of the sub key that Ivan used to sign his message. Only a few keyserver currently support searching keys by the key id of a sub key.

@_subject: filenames of encrypted attachments visible ? How hard would it 
FWIW, my KMail reports a good signature. If you want to analyse the problem then I can send you my version of this message.
If you are concerned about those headers then you'll have to use a remailer (or even a chain of remailers).

@_subject: evolution & textmode 
Why do you want to do this? Following the "MIME Security with OpenPGP" specification (RFC 3156) the to be signed data is first canonicalized (e.g. all line endings are converted to CRLF) and then the signature is calculated. Textmode signatures don't make any sense in this setting. They were used by PGP 2 in order to circumvent exactly the problems that are nowadays circumvented by the canonicalization prior to calculating the signature. Textmode signatures do only make sense when you clearsign a text. But Evolution doesn't support clearsigning AFAIK.
