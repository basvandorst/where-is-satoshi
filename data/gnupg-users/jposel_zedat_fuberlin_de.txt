@_subject: GnuPG key export 
Dear GPG Users,
I've had troubles transferring a GPG key pair to a PGP installation.
What is required to export both the public (this works) and the
private key (this doesn't work) in a format that can be imported in
PGP? Thanks for any tips. GPG used is 1.0.6 on Win2K.

Hash: SHA1
Dear GPG users,
I have a small problem which seems to get a little bit out of control
;) I'm using a DSS/DH key, generated with GPG 1.06 on Windows 2000,
with the KeyID 0xADCF7E94[1].
I receive a message, encrypted to this key. GPG, both on Windows and
Unix platform[2] give me an error when trying to decrypt this message:
And as well on Windows:
But the secret key is there, and signing etc works flawlessly:
Thanks for any tips on what could be wrong!

[1] The key can be fetched from most key servers, or via
[2] Debian 3.0 Linux with GPG 1.2.1, Windows 2000 SP3 with GPG 1.2.0

Yes! I think it does this automatically when generating the key, but I
just checked and the first sig is the self sig.

The key was just created with GnuPG 1.06 back in 2001. Nevertheless, I
ran "gpg --update-trustdb", until it didn't ask anymore, but the
problem is still there :/
