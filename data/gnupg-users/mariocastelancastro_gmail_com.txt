Hi, I think than keys got imported sucefully but please do not write
personal messages for technical support, write it to list (Or with
carbon copy to list).
I personally usually have no time nor english fluidity enought to
response very often in the list, much less to response to a dobut

IMO steganography should be mixed with cryptography to be secure.
As example: LSB in pictures (Unless you have a professional camera)
will be random (High entropy and no predecible). You can replace it
with ciphertext (Undistinguible from random noise) and no one will
note the difference.
Of course if instead of replace the LSB with direct ciphertext you put
an GPG encrypted file the magic numbers will prove than there is an
encripted message. It can't be decoded w/o the key but you can be
forced to give the key.
Note: resent because the first wasn't sent to the mailing list.

Entropy is a relative thing AFAIR:
For one who knows than a password was generated by using diceware the
entropy will be 7776^n + 7776^n-1 ... 7776^1 where n is the number of
For one who knows the lenght of password the entropy will be 256^n

would be (26+26+10)^n.
In contrast for one who do not know how password has been generated
the entropy will be as if it were a random one.
In short the apparent entropy of passowrds depends of how many the

Loop unrolling only gives more performance in very small loops, for
not so small ones there can be in fact a performance penality since as
the unrolled code is great it leaves less cache for data.
The complexity of a S2K algoritm is constant for variable input and
constant iterations, in other words, it is O(1) but this O(1) assumes
constant number of iterations, if we consider that factor the
complexity would be O(iterations).
So that O(1) than you say is correct but meaningless in this context.

Ciprian: Wath you say is possible but useless.
One could build a machine who computes anything in only 1 clock cycle
or than not even need clock cycles: there are circuits than change it
output as it input is changed without need of a pulse (Usually from a
clock, it is: constant frecuency pulse generator) but the change is
not inmmediate. As the compexity (Circuit complexity, not
computational complexity) increases the delay betwen input change (Or
clock signal) and output change becomes greater and greater thus they
operating frecuence is low.
So, yes, it can be built a machine than compues the S2K in one clock
cycle, but it clock cycle shold be of very very low frecuency thus
having the same performance as a machine than computes a S2K in say,
20,000 cycles but with much faster cicles.
This is the contrary version of the megahert myth: "More cycles, more
speed" than assumes than a 2.4 GHz CPU have the same eficiency per
cycle than a 3.2 one. You instead think than more eficience per cycle
gives more performance, your mistrake is than the cycles will be
larger and frecuency much lower.
Performance = Frecuency * Performance of each cycle. Sometimes one can
make cycles 2 times more efficient but frecuency only 20% lower as
intel do with P4 to Core 2 but this tradeoff can't be repeated infite
times. There are some point where slighty more efficient cycles
provokes a much more loss in frecuency and therefore the overall
performance will be low.

Hash: SHA256
Januarty 3rd 2010 in gnupg-users at gnupg.org thread "Encrypting with an
message expiration date"
"self-destructing data" is a big fallacy, is almost the same issue as
computer "virus".
There is no data/software (Software is data) that act by itself, it
should be interpreted to take an effect.  A "computer virus" is a
malware that you run accidentally.  From my old days with Windows I
remember those malware in CD-ROMs with an run.ini inside (Or something
similar) that tells W to run the malware.  That virus is not self
acting, just that operating system is designed to interpret those
run.ini.  Not even the Operating System is self acting, you instructed
the CPU to run it!.
There is no real way to *enforce* an expiration data.  In the same
manner virusses don't act by itself, data don't self destructs, just
the user runs the program to enforce the expiration date without ever
They user may simply chose to not run the program or to copy the data
and put in a safe place like an DVD before it gets deleted.  There are
of course, methods that make this much more hard, and almost
impossible, like the ones currently used for DRM.
The only kinda effective way I see to efectiveley enforce data
deletion are IC with a storage of energy inside (Say, supercapacitor)
that destroys the data (Ethier by zeroizing it or to detonate an small
explosion to destroy the internal of the IC) when ethier the energy is
too low, someone try to open the IC or too many bad keys are entered.
This IC would be self acting of course, as it is a phisical object but
it would be very very expensive or maybe impossible to build and no
one warranty they can be found methods to deactivate the protection
methods without delete the data.
DRM-like software wouldn't be usefull at all as software can be run in
simulated enviroments and removed, and it may be morally unaceptable
but that depends on the exact use I think.

I think the WoT and in general the cryptography is not widely used
because few people really care about their privacity.
Is about the same issue as free software, there is possible to use
only free software but most people don't aim at a fully free
enviroment because they are really careless about freedom, same with
cryprography, very few really care about their privacity.

Is good if you know that, you will use the crypto better but is not
nessesary IMO.  Can you explain why that things are *nessesary* in
order to use crypto?, we have "user friendly" crypto programs like
seahorse, I can't figure out someone is unable to use it with the
available "user friendly" software like seahorse.
What is your point Robert?.  The same apply to planes, some people
don't trust planes, some don't trust computers or cryptography or ,
but that don't mean the public in general is unable to fly in planes
or to use cryptography ;).
HTTPS is not invisible, is transparent with most browers.  Invisible
is as example, the logs that your ISP, mine or google (likley) have of
all our mail, because you don't see it, you even don't know if they
really have such logs.
Transparent is one thing that you can see if you want in the same
manner you can ignore it, like the thoustands of instructions in
machine code to run a software or the encryption in HTTPS.  You can do
"hexdump /usr/local/gpg", or click a button in FF that tellsyou the
encryption information.
