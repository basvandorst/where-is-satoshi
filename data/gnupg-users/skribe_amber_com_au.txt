Hash: SHA1
I have some old, expired keys that are listed in the various keyservers.  How do I go about sending the revocation certificate to them?

@_subject: User IDs and Sub-keys 
I'm new to GPG.  I don't understand how user IDs or additional sub-keys work.  I've read the manual, the faq and browsed the last few months of archives for this list.  Perhaps I missed something.  Perhaps this is a problem with my email software (Kmail 2.1).
What I am particulalrly interested in is being able to establish separate email IDs using the same key.  For instance, one for skribe and one for the name Joe Bloggs.  Currently, when I sign a document the default key (skribe) is used, even when I stipulate that the Joe Bloggs ID should be used in the email client.  This somewhat cramps my anonymity =).  Do I require separate and distinct key-pairs for this or is there a way to do it with the one key-pair. Additionally, Could someone please direct me to some additional documentiation (apart from the manual) as to how to use the IDs and sub-keys, to sign and encrypt?

@_subject: open-source vs proprietary security software 
Hash: SHA1
It's a question of numbers.  The more eyes that see your code the greater the chance that you'll find the holes.  With proprietary code you're limited to who you can afford to hire to look at your code.  If you can only afford to hire Fil Zimmaman, MCSE, as opposed to Phil Zimmerman, GOD, then the potential for missing security holes is considerably greater.  The other reason is cost.  Phil Zimmerman (or hundreds of equally qualified people) may choose to peruse your code and offer advice and in all likelihood it will cost you nothing. That's the sort of experience and knowledge that generally only the big corps can afford.

Not to be picky, but I never said that it was perfect, just that the chances increase of finding a bug.  Would the false positive have been found if the source had been closed?  Possibly another example of the value of open source software =).
Very scary stuff.  Of course, there is the potential here that this may benefit OS software as foreign govts (non-US) no longer trust windoze and move to something else.  Has the NSA-key plan been nixed or is it still

@_subject: Primary UID changed 
I've just created a new UID (using --edit-keys) and now it is listed as the primary uid. Is this supposed to happen (it didn't with 1.0.4) and how do I switch it back?
I'm running 1.0.5.
