@_subject: PGP 7.0.3 refuses to encrypt with my key 
I tried to encrypt some message with PGPfreeware 7.0.3 with my GnuPG 1.0.6-
created key, but PGP could not encrypt the message with my key: "An error has occured: key can't be used for encryption".
I read in the FAQ about problems with older versions that refused to encrypt with ElGamal type-20 keys. But mine is a type-16 key, so this should be a different problem. Signing with PGP works and is also no problem with GPG.
What can I do?  Thanks.

@_subject: Compatibility problem ?? 
is there a known compatibility problem of GPG with PGP 6 and 7?
Other people can't use my gpg key because "key can't be used for encryption".
I used the default values for key generation with gpg 1.0.6
There's nothing about that in the FAQ.
Thanks in advance

Thanks for your hints. A keyserver problem is not possible because I did not use a keyserver (I first wanted to try this with a test key without spreading it). I think I have an answer despite I don't really know whether I did something wrong. The ElGamal subkey is present (for encryption only) but there is also a DSA subkey. GPG has no problems with that subkey but I think PGP 6/7 (which I've tried) can't handle it because everything worked after I removed it. As I read in the OpenPGP-RFC it should be compliant to have such DSA subkey but it's no problem that I can't use it because I didn't want to do this later anyway. Only the top level key provides signature services so this should not be of any practical use to me - or is it?
