Hi there,
I've been trying to get a Gemalto USB Shell Token V2 + OpenPGP card v2
to work with gnupg 2.0.16, but with no success.
The command "gpg --card-status" appears to work, but "gpg --card-edit"
fails as follows:
    $ gpg --card-edit
    scdaemon[25465]: reading public key failed: Missing item in object
    scdaemon[25465]: reading public key failed: Missing item in object

    scdaemon[25465]: sending signal 12 to client 25465
    gpg: OpenPGP card not available: Broken pipe
    gpg/card>
Any attempt to run edit commands results in the same "Broken pipe"
message. This seems to be the same problem reported in
    But in my case the problem persists, even after reboot. There has been
a post a while back, which claimed this reader was supported by gnupg
with PC/SC:
    Does anybody know what might be the problem?
Any help is greatly appreciated.

Hi Mukund,
Ok, so I was trying with gnupg 2.0.16... I switched now to 1.4.10, and
it seems to be working fine. So it seems to be a bug with 2.0.16... I'll
try to submit a bug report.
Thank you for the tip!
