Did you mean to say "web of thrust"? Kind of funny that image. Adam

Have you imported your friend's public key into your keyring? Enigmail
should allow you to do this.

Eric, instead of setting $GNUPGHOME, have you tried just setting 'secret keyring /path/to/secring.gpg'
in your gpg.conf file? I did this the other day (with a similar
present) and it works fine for me.

Hehe -- it's too early here - that should read
'secret-keyring /path/to/secring.gpg'
(added missing hyphen).

It's possibly a setting in the mailman server which gives the main
reply-to: header as the originator and not the list.

@_subject: auto sign files 
As a newbie in this area, I understand that there are at least two
types of security - the most desirable security and more secure than
now. This scenario fits in to the latter.
Sure, automated signing is not desirable as it still has flaws within
it if someone cracks your machine. But the alternative may be sending
out unsigned files, which is even less secure (assuming that they have
still broken in to your machine). Done properly, the automated signing
can add another layer of security that needs to be cracked. Does this
sound reasonable?

I currently have one keypair and I use this on two machines - my
secure personal machine, owned by me, and a laptop owned by my
employer. When I use my key on my employer's machine,  I store my
private key on my usb storage device.

Just out of interest, why do you want to write a plugin for Postfix -
what is the end result? What functionality do you want to add to

Would windows users be willing to fund development by contribution?
That way, once a threshold of money has been received then someone
could start work on the problem.

@_subject: Upgrading keys to larger than 1024 
I have keys that I have used (sparingly) since 2004. This is a 1024
keysize. That keypair has a few signatures through key signing.
What is the best approach to upgrading keys to 4096? Is it just create a
new keypair and then go to lots of key signing events again (pain), or is
there a way to do this with my current keys?
You back your data up on the same planet?

Thanks everyone - I will try contacting the people who have signed my keys
by email and see what they say - I very rarely see them in real life.
