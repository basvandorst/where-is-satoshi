@_subject: new version 
Hello Benjamin,
First what version of gnupg do you use ? And with which OS ? There were
some sparc related changes in 1.0.1 and later, so you might
want to try gnupg-1.0.1e to see if that's faster.
Also what algorithm did you use? If it's still too slow, we'll have to use the new functions that
appeared in gmp-3.0. You can look at  to
see the speed comparisons of UltraSPARC versus other architectures
with this version.

OK but remember it's a development version, not for production.
Though I suspect the 1.0.2 relase will happen soon...
No, sorry...
