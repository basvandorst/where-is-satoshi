@_subject: GnuPG agent and non-shell application 
Hash: SHA256
Hi everybody
I have GnuPg 1.4.6 installed and I have my .gnupg directory as a
symbolic link pointing to an encrypted partition. As soon as I need
my keys I mount the encrypted partition and the symbolic link is
resolved with no problem. The problem is the use of gnupg agent: I
type gpg-agent --daemon > gpg-agent-info so that the variable
information are stored to that file. Under my .bashrc I have added
the following line "source gpg-agent-info" so that the variable is
correctly set up.
The problem is the use of gnupg agent with program such as
thunderbird, kpgp. They cannot see the variable GPG_AGENT_INFO as
all shells do. I cannot set anything in .xsession because the
encrypted partition isn't mounted on boot but on demand. Could you
please tell me a reasonable solution for this matter?

Hash: SHA256
Hello everybody
I was wondering about how gnupg works when I encrypt a message for
multiple recipients. As long as I know public-key encryption works as
described in this image
But how about using multiple public keys? I really cannot figure it out.
Thanks for your time

@_subject: RSA or DSA? That's the question 
Hash: SHA1
Hello everybody
as you can see my key is about to expire and I need to create a new one.
When I created it I didn't know which algorithm was the best choice and
I just chose the first option. Now I still don't know which is the best
to choose and why. Is it one more secure than the other? I don't think
so but I think there are some difference that make one algorithm
suitable for some uses than the other.
I was thinking to create one rsa key and one subkey for encryption. What
do you think? What do you advise?
Thank for you attention

@_subject: RSA or DSA? That's the question 
First off all thanks for your answers, I have now clearer ideas :-). For
what concerns SHA-1 I read that, thanks to the collisions, an attacker
can modify the message but the signature verification well be ok. I
think that's really hard to do right? By the way I am thinking on
creating a rsa key pair (with rsa subkey) as I am willing to buy a smart
card kit. However you told the very standard algorithm is DSA/Elgamail
so what should I do? Create two key pair? A rsa one and a dsa/elgamail one?
One more thing: the key expiry. Do you think that setting the expiry
date after a year or two is a good choice? Or is better not to set a
expiry date and revoke the key when necessary?
Thanks again

@_subject: RSA or DSA? That's the question 
In my openpgp preferences in thunderbird I've tried to set sha-256 but I
got an error saying it was only possible to use sha-128. What went wrong?
0_0 I didn't know that....what a bad news!
Distributed key cracking plus the
DSA keysize is 1024 and cannot be changed. Does the considerations above
apply to a dsa key?
Thanks again

@_subject: [Half-OT] Materials for a GnuPg Talk 
Hello everybody
and sorry for this half-ot message. For the linuxday I want to prepare a
talk about gnupg. I am thinking on starting to talk about privacy in
general (communications in clear and its problems), then taking a little
bit about cryptography (Caesar cipher, symmetric, asymmetric
cryptography) and then starting to talk about gnupg from the user point
of view.
Since I have never had any talk I am collecting materials to prepare a
decent presentation using impress. So I need images, animation and also
documents because I need to study :-).
Any help will be very appreciated.

@_subject: how long should a password be? 
Hash: SHA256
Well IMHO you should merge together some significant (just
for you!) events, hard to forget, and turn them into a password.
It should be
- - longer >= 25 IMHO
- - nonsense in any language to avoid dictionary attack
- - contain special character such as !?$?()...
