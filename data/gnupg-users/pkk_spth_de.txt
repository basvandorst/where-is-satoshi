@_subject: Multiple email addresses - any alternative to ask everyone to sign 
I'm currently using 4 email addresses - 1 for private mail, 1 for a
small business, and 2 for university. Currently I have three keys - one
for the private mail, one for the business, and one for unversity. Each
of the keys has been signed with all keys.
Of course it is annoying to have to ask everyone to sign three keys -
after all they are all my keys, and the people I ask to sign my key all
get to see the same passport. Is there a better alternative?
I do not consider my university computer safe enough to trust it with
the private key for my private mail. I.e. I do not want someone who
breaks into the university office and installs a keylogger to be able to
read encrypted mail sent to my private account.

Hmm, since everyone seems to think "He doesn't consider the unviersity
computer secure enough for something, so he shouldn't consider it secure
enough for anything", it seems I'm failing and communicating what I want
to do. Maybe having a look at the following scenario will help:
I have three computers, a smartphone named CONFIDENTIAL, a desktop in my
office named SECRET, and one in the underground shelter with armed
guards and the dog that needs to be fed the right type of meat to let me
through named TOPSECRET.
I have email addresses confidential at me, secret at me and topsecret at me.
People sending confidential mail will send to confidential at me, and
expect a reply within a short timeframe, so I need to be able to decrpyt
and read the mail on CONFIDENTIAL. On SECRET, I want to read mail sent
to confidential at me and secret at me. People that value security over timely
processing will send mail to topsecret at me. On TOPSECRET I want to be
able to decrypt mail sent to confidential at me, secret at me and opsecret at me.
Nothing that happens to computer CONFIDENTAIL may allow other people to
read mail sent to  secret at me or topsecret at me. Nothing that happens to
SECRET may allow other people to read mail sent totopsecret at me.
I can handle this scenario by having three keypairs, one for each of the
email addresses. But this would require everyone to sign all three of
these keys. Is there a way to handle this secnario, such that people
only have to sign one key?

I just tried googling a bit, but the only posts I found are those that
assume that the effort to break A+B would be a+b. I did not find the
detailed writeups you mentoned, or even anything else about the
assumption that breaking A+B takes at least effort max(a,b).
Well, here's a (rough, and maybe naive) explanation of why I assumed
that the effort is at least max(a, b):
First, I assume assume that the effort for breaking anything so is
much more than the effort for encryption given the key, that the
latter is negligible.
So assume there is an attack on A+B. that allows to "break" A+B with
effort e less than max(a,b). That means that at least one of e < a or
e < b is true.
Case 1: e < a: Well, whenever someone is using A, we can just encrypt
the ciphertext using B with a key of our choice. Any attack on A+B
thus immediately translates into an attack on A, contradicting the
assmption e < a. The attack on A would be of the same type as the one
on A+B.
Case 2: e < b:
Hmm, this one seems harder. If I have an attack on A+B that yields
information about the key, I can get a chosen-ciphertext attack on B
from it.
An attack on A+B that yields information about the plaintext could be
combined with an attack on A that yields information on the key to get
an attack on B that yields information on the plaintext.
If A happens to have a weak key, I would get an attack on B that
yields information on the plaintext as well. Any way I should get an
interesting result of the type b < a + e. I think there is a stronger
result possible here, but I admit don't know how I could get there.

I wonder if it would be a good idea to have an option to combine
symmetric ciphers, e.g. users could state a preference list like this:
TWOFISH+AES256 3DES+BLOWFISH+AES AES 3DES
The meaning of A+B would be to encrypt using A first, and then encrypt
the result using B with a different key. Assuming it takes effort a to
break cipher A and effort b to break cipher b, this should result in
effort at least max(a, b) needed to break A+B. And with uncertainity
about possible weaknesses in individual ciphers, this seems like a
reasonable measure to me.

GPG supports the feature of having multiple UIDs per key.
However this requires special care of anyone signing such a key.
AFAIK, there is no really user-friendly, and definitely no
newbie-friendly way to do so. IMO this makes it much harder to expand
the web of trust.
Would it be a good idea to discourage people from having multiple UIDs
per key, and encourage them to create a separate key per UID instead?

3) They require the user to have configured mail for their OS.
IMO, until the functionality to sign keys with multiple UIDs and send
each signature to the associated UID gets integrated into mailclients
or their plugins, keys with multiple UIDs should not be used.

Well, IMO enigmail does a somewaht resonable job for single-uid keys,

like pius does). And then they can right-click and select to send the

This is not optimal, as it requires two steps, and requires filling in
the receivers email address manually. While I don't use Windows, AFAIK,
this works the same on Windows as on other systems. It only requires
mail to be configured in the mail client (which every user that runs a
mail client has done), as opposed to the OS level.

Possibly hidden behind some new option, if that helps security for

If my mail client will no longer be able to display some old encrypted

There has been plenty of research on email security and the need for
encryption is well-known.
However, I wonder if there has been any research on mail security. Of
course, one could just put a GPG-encrypted letter in an ordinary
envelope, but there are more common measures that are meant to give some
additional security over the standard mail. I wonder how well those work.
Are there any good textbooks, etc?
There are a few aspects I can think of (but there is probably more):
* Patterns printed on the inside of envelopers. These are meant gainst
the use of light to read the contents of an unopened enveloper. How
strong are these in the face of image recognition? Did someone study
such patters?
* Tamper-proof enevelopes, meant to make it hard to open an envelope
unnoticed. How well do these work? Does it even make snsne to put much
effort into them, as an attacker could use a new envelope (though there
might be some difficulties involved to get or fake the right postmark)?
* There seems to be some literature on the security of wax seals (e.g.
"Licet ad regimen", published in 1198 - does anyone know of a German,
French or English translation).
