@_subject: Forbes article: The Encryption Debate Is Over - Dead At The Hands 
??????? Original Message ???????
Facebook receives disproportionally high criticism in recent years not because of technical reasons but because of politics. The wave of attacks on Facebook began after 2016 US election. Initially it was like "fake news in facebook helped one candidate to win" and the idea was to allow journalists of big media companies to mark information in facebook as "fake" and probably delete. Later the attack has spread in all directions. Nowadays everyone tries to punch Facebook in order to look smart.
Regarding techincal reasons. The author argues that if devices are compromised, then encrypted communication between them is too. But this is not a surprise, it has always been. July 2019 in this aspect is not different from January 2019, or 2017, or 2007. In addition, not only Facebook, but other big tech firms (Microsoft, Apple, Twitter and so on) can download unencrypted  data from user device for analysis before encryption. As an exercise, one can replace "Facebook" in that article with "Apple", the bias will be more evident.

The paper overstated protonmail security weaknesses. The paper does not point to possible or actual attacks, nor reviews  code. It merely boils down to two analytical (hypothetical thinking) conclusions: 1) protonmail server can be compromised, verified smartphone app is more reliable in this aspect 2) for outside encryption protonmail allows to use weak passwords.
