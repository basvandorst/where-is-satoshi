Hi there,
Firstly, apolgies if this is a simple query. I didn't get the answer though from reading the manual.
My friend and I signed each others' keys last week. However, since then he has added another UID with his work email address to his key. This showed up in my keyring when I sync'ed with the keyserver. This was after I had signed his key. However his new UID is not shown as trusted by me, even though he has signed his new UID with his key, which I have in turn also signed.
Is this supposed to happen?

Thanks Herbert, David, for the quick replies.
Ah yes, thanks. So I have now set the owner-trust for his key to "full", but still it says "unknown" for the other UIDs. So, I should manually set the trust for keys / UIDs that I think I trust based on who has signed them?
I was under the impression that the trust would be inferred automatically by gpg, according to the trust rules ("completes-needed", "marginals-needed", "max-cert-depth").
For example, in this case, I have trusted his key fully, and he has signed his UID, which is one complete link (or two from my own key), right?
If not, what is the purpose of these parameters?
Is there any reason not to do this? I.e. is it possible for someone else to upload a UID to his key and make it look like he's signed it?
Sorry for the newbie questions!

Ah, thanks, that makes sense. And then I can sign his new UIDs too? Or just change their trust level?
Thanks, this is helpful. So, if I have to set the trust of other keys myself in order to recognise them as valid, what is the function of the "completes-needed", "marginals-needed" and "max-cert-depth" options in my gpg.conf file?
Thanks again!

Thanks, that makes sense.
So I guess my question is: is this a guide for me, and then I should manually set the trust level on key F myself (if I am satisfied that the chains exist), or should gpg do this automatically for me based on the parameters in my gpg.conf? It doesn't seem to be calculating anything automatically at the

But isn't that the point of signing new UID's with the original one?

Right, that makes sense now.
Thanks everyone for the help - I think I was rather confused about the differences and connections between "validity", "trust" and "ownertrust":
Yes, that's what I now understand :-)
Please excuse one final question: I have signed keys with one person (A), whom I trust fully, and he has signed keys with another person (B), whom I know, but with whom I have not signed keys. B's key is (correctly) showing as *valid*. Should I still wait until I can check his identity using the photo-id and fingerprint, or is this now good enough for me to sign B's key?
I wouldn't have thought so, but I just want to make sure I'm absolutely clear about this stuff.
Thanks again,
