Quoting Werner Koch :
This version still has the bug in the Windows random number generator that
causes the following warning:
gpg: NOTE: you should run 'diskperf -y' to enable the disk statistics
Please fix your header files in Mingw32/CPD.

Hash: SHA1
Quoting "Leigh S. Jones, KR6X" :
Querying the disk performance counters WILL improve random number
generation, but when compiled with Mingw32/CPD, the size of the buffer
used to retrieve the performance counters is too small and the function
call fails.  Thus, GnuPG does not and never has used the disk performance
counters correctly.  If the performance counters are enabled and GnuPG
uses the correct size buffer, you will not see that error message.

You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.
You don't want a passphrase - this is probably a *bad* idea!
I will do it anyway.  You can change your passphrase at any time,
using this program with the option "--edit-key".
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Quoting Arild Bj=F8rk :
GnuPG only supports 160-bit hashes for DSA signatures.  Unfortunately, GP=
is hiding the error message from you.  You can create an RSAv4 key if you=
 want
to try the longer hashes.

Hash: SHA1
I have just released GnuPG v1.0.7a-nr2.  Other than updating the version
number, I have not made any code changes since 1.0.7a-nr2b1.  I have changed
to Microsoft Visual C++ .NET which caused the binaries to be built slightly
I was not able to resolve the speed issue with regards to LDAP keyserver
operations.  There seems to be a delay when contacting the server, but then
everything proceeds at expected speeds.
I made a new Installer for this version.  I switched to from InstallShield
to Wise, so if you have any problems with this release's Installer, let me
This will probably be the last release until 1.0.8 due to several factors. Most of the Windows bugs in 1.0.7 have been resolved and incorporated into
this release.    Development on the official GnuPG CVS servers appears to be
geared towards new features.  Some of these changes may cause compatibility
problems for programs like GPGshell.  Unless there is a security fix or some
other reason to make another 1.0.7 release, this will be it for awhile.
As always, thanks to all of you who have tested my previous releases and
feel free to report any bugs you find.

Hash: SHA1
Quoting "Leigh S. Jones, KR6X" :
GnuPG has always used the unix forward slash, even in the Mingw32
release.  If you look at the README.W32 under "Installation
instructions", it says, "Please use forward slashes and not the
backslashes when setting filenames for GnuPG into the Registry."
I compiled the binary using the latest Mingw32/CPD from CVS with the
official source code.  I also included Disastry's patch to allow GnuPG
to generate v3 RSA keys.  Other than that, the binary should be
IDENTICAL to Warner Koch's official binary.
If you find a bug, I will be happy to apply a patch and release a fixed
version.  Also, if anyone would like features supported that are not in
the "official" release (ie. RSA v3 Key Generation), e-mail me.   My goal
is to create a Win32 release that gives Windows users maximum
flexibility with GnuPG.

* RSA v3 Key Generation Patch   - Enables GPG to generate RSA v3 keys
  - Enables GPG to generate RSA v4 sign and encrypt keys
* Mingw32 Keyserver Patch - fixes keyserver bug under Windows

Hash: SHA1
Quoting Werner Koch :
Nothing in the Nullify release forces the user to do any of these
things.  In fact, they would have to go out of their way to do so. Since SHA-256/384/512 is not the default hash, a user would have to
explicitly change their algorithm preferences after key creation or
force its use on the command line.  Generating RSA v3 keys or RSA v4
sign+encrypt keys can only be done with the --expert option.  The reason
I created the Nullify release was to give the USER the option to use the
algorithms and features he/she wants.

I am almost finished with an updated binary (and source) for a MSVC port of
GnuPG 1.0.7a-cvs that has these changes.  It should be out in a few days.  BTW,
if anyone using the nullify binary has any problems, please feel free to e-mail
me.  Most of the GnuPG developers use unix, and I can help solve Win32 problems.
