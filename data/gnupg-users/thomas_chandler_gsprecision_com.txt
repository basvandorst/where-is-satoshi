============================== START ==============================
I have two users that have Gpg4win installed on their machines and they are running into a problem when they rightclick on a file, choose send to, and then after they send the email, it goes into the outbox and stays there.  I have also noticed that when you open the email in the outbox, the recipient field is empty, but once they put the recipient in a second time, and click send, the email will send.  It is important as far as productivity goes that I can get these users to use the rightclick on a file, and send to functionality.  I have done testing, and only the machines that have pgp4win on them are having this problem, nobody else is, so I have narrowed it down to pgp4win.  Does anyone know what I can do to make this work?   Thank you very much!
It's outlook 2007 sp2
PGP4WIN version 2.0.4
