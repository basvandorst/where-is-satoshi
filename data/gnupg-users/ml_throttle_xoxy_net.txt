@_subject: How to send a key to a keyserver? 
I tried
gpg2 --verbose --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-keys -- 72ABFF0923A87CF22D0ED7C4FDEE765D017077F1
and got the message
gpg: sending key FDEE765D017077F1 to hkp server pool.sks-keyservers.net
gpgkeys: HTTP post error 22: The requested URL returned error: 417
gpg: keyserver internal error
gpg: keyserver send failed: Keyserver error
What's wrong here?  Does the problem sit in front of the keyboard?
Any help will be appreciated.

So it's a problem with my http proxy?

@_subject: Fwd: tar, compress, split and then encrypt a list of files 
Felipe Vieira :
I suppose, the problem is, that ?split? can't split to stdout.
Maybe ?dd? could be a replacement for ?split? for getting chunks
of data and then using the shell to compute file names with
sequence numbers?
tar ... | compress |
  # put a block size and number of blocks per file of your choice here:
  bs=1024k
  count=1024
  # number of digits to be used for the sequence number:
  suffixlength=3
  # put a filename prefix of your choice here:
  prefix=
  seqnum=0
  test=test
  until
  {
    if ! "$test" "${ -le "${suffixlength:=1}"
    then
      printf >&2 '%s\n' 'The sequence numbers excede the suffix length.'
      test=:
    fi
    file="$( printf "%s%.${suffixlength}d" "$prefix" "$seqnum" )"
    {
      LC_ALL=POSIX dd ${bs:+bs="$bs"} ${count:+count="$count"} 3>&- |
      encrypt > "${file}" 2>&3 3>&-
    } 3>&2 2>&1 |
    { grep -F -q -x -e '0+0 records in' && cat ; } > /dev/null
  }
  do
    seqnum="$(( ${seqnum} + 1 ))"
  done
As this problem is more one of split/dd/shell than of gpg, how
about discussing this in the usenet group ?comp.unix.shell? rather
than in the ?gnupg-users? mailinglist?

@_subject: Show that an encrypted message was signed, without decrypting it 
Stefan Claas :
[The ability to check that an encrypted message has been signed.]? What do you mean by the term ?secured bytes?? To check, whether a message pretends to have been signed by Bob, one could check, that the ?content-type? message header field has got the value ?multipart/signed? (look at my message, for I say ?pretends to have been signed? rather than ?has been signed?, because Mallory could grab the (unencrypted) message, remove the signature (if present), either put it into a ?multipart/signed? structure, attaching an (of course then) bad signature of one of Bob's signed messages or just sign it by herhelf.? Then she would send the result to Alice.?
To be sure, whether the message has actually been signed by Bob, Alice would of course have to check the signature.? But this would reveal the identity of the signing key, and, if (the owner of) the signing key is known to the recipient, the identity of the signer.? (After all, proving the identity of the signer and the authenticity of the signed message is the purpose of signing a
