Certainly it would be preferable to have a static IPv6 address for that
sort of thing, but it's still quite simple to run services from home by
using dynamic DNS. I'm able to have ddclient run on my router, which
will inform my DNS provider (Cloudflare) of any changes to my dynamic
IPv4 address. Sure, during the occasional change to my address, my
services might go down for a minute or two. For me at least, that's not
the end of the world.

That is true, you definitely need a static IP address to run a mail
server. For many other things though, I've managed to get by with a
dynamic address.
