@_subject: GPG encryption and decryption takes excessive time. 
Firstly, my knowledge of GPG is very weak and I am not a UNIX administrator, so my access and knowledge are rather limited.
I have been asked to set up file encryption / decryption of files transferred between our SUN OS servers and two customer's servers.
One customer is using a basic 2048 size key, the other a 3072 key.
GPG has been installed and I have created my keys per the requirements of the clients and imported their keys without issues.
I can encrypt files for them Ok and can decrypt the files they send me.
However, the time taken to encrypt and decrypt each file is colossal - between 6 (2048 key files) and 15 seconds (3072 key files)  per file.
I have set this up on two different local servers (same OS) and get the same results.
The server details are:  SunOS ioponnet-kn-t1 5.10 Generic_142909-17 sun4v sparc sun4v
I have tried recreating the keys locally, but no change.
The other party says that encryption / decryption at their end takes in the order of 50ms per file.
Can anyone suggest anything to help reduce the time to something more viable?
