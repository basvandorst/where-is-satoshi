IMHO, there's another problem, an entry barrier to the WoT. The
practice of key exchange is widespread in very close circles of geeks,
Linux developers and, to a certain degree, scientists. For someone who
does not belong to these categories and does not attend any
conferences, the web of trust is hardly reachable. Unfortunately, I
know no solutions besides commercial CAs.

Actually, you don't really *need* to use crypto in email, the
confidence level will be less, but to most people it is enough :)
