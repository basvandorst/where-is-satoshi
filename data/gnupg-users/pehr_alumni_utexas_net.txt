@_subject: GPGFiletool does not find all keys in my keychain 
I am trying to use the GPGFiletool on Mac OS X to encrypt a file for  a particular recipient.  However, it does not show that person as  being available.  Other tools, e.g., GPG in the terminal window, or  the GPG Mail plug in, have the recipient's key.  Why does GPGFiletool  not find it?

I did figure out that the problem was that the key was not yet  trusted.  Once I signed the key, it appeared in GPGFT.
