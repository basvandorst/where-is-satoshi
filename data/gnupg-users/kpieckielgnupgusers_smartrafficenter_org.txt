@_subject: Secondary Keys 
Content-Disposition: inline
I was playing around with a keyring I created that I wasn't going to use
for anything.  Here is my observation and question about it:
I created a keypair with a secondary key for encryption only.  I then
created a second secondary key for excryption.  Now, when I encrypt files,
it always uses this second encryption key.  How can I get GnuPG to choose
which secondary key to use for encryption?
