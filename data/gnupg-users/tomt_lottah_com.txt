A wishes to send message to B.
A encrypts message using B's key. Opens encrypted message and corrupts
the file by altering one or more characters/adding redundant lines of
code, e.g. changes case of first occurrence of 'T' in the code. Saves
file and sends to B.
B will get an error message when trying to decrypt message. However B
knows that the first occurrence of 'T' needs case conversion and edits
file. The edited file is now capable of being decrypted.
Since no one apart from A & B knows how the encrypted file has been
corrupted, this seems to be a method of increasing security.
Question: Is there in theory any way of breaking the corrupted
encryption through brute force?

Hi Robert,
Thanks for your response: that was for a trivial case :)
Now let's try a curveball.  We substitute lines 9 to 12 for the
equivalent _somewhere else_ in the code, so it won't be a simple
transform.  This is based on a rule that a message sent on the 12th
day of June would have certain properties, so no memorizing is

Let's consider another scenario where lines 9 to 12 are meaningless
code inserted into the message. B has the rule to dispose of it but
no one else would know the location and length of corruption.
My gut feeling is that the human element throws a spanner into the

- lots to learn here :) )
