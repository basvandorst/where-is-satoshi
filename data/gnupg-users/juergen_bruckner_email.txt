Well i think that's one more reason why you need a smart card or token
like GnuPG-Card or Nitrokey (or a Yubikey for my sake).

Hello Stefan,
despite my cooperation with the p?p foundation, the lack of support for
smart cards and tokens is THE knockout criterion why I do not use
sequoia pgp.
It's a good question what to do if you lose your SC or token.
Basically, it has to be said that you should definitely have a backup of
your key. And you have to be very careful with your SC or tokens.
In principle it is almost the same as losing your credit card or
passport etc. while traveling; you have to provide alternatives (e.g.
multiple smartcards).

Hi Stefan
Well my first choice - as it is a OpenSource product - is always a Nitrokey [1], I use both the NK Start as well as the NK Pro.
But also see the following....
Well, Nitrokeys do also work on Android devices, with a USB-Adapter.
In case you want to use your SmartCard/Token on the Andoid device via NFC, the best choice would be a Yubikey 5 NFC [2].
The Windows software to enter the PIN-Code is your PGP Software with SmartCard Support. On Android you should use Openkeychain for that.
As Android e-mail-client the most people who use PGP, also use K9-Mail;
my personal preference and my strong recommendation is the app called "FairEmail", as this app supports both, PGP (via Openkeychain) and also I hope i have been able to help you a bit.
Best regards

As far as I know the OpenPGP function of the OpenPGP-Card cannot be used via NFC / RFID. You need to use the on card chip and a card reader for PGP operations.

What kind of OpenPGP card do you use?
The OpenPGP Smart Card V3.3 + MiFare DESFire [1] don't support PGP operations via RFID.

No problem!
I see.
Well I don't have any experiences with other cards than these from Zeitcontrol and the tokens from Yubikey and Nitrokey.
I know that the Yubikey5 supports PGP operations via RFID as a few customers from me use it with their mobile devices.
But as Werner stated in his e-mail before it may be a 'problem' specific with GnuPG as it doesn't support wireless operation for security reasons.
And I really don't know if another OpenPGP implementation does support This was already a big issue with Mozilla's Thunderbird 78 and it's native implementation of OpenPGP instead of Enigmail.
Sorry that I can't help in a better way!
best regards and a great weekend

I don't understand why HTML in e-Mails is so important for some people.
For example, I configured my Mailserver to sort out HTML-Mails as Spam as long the sender is not on a whitelist.
HTML in e-Mails is a very big security risk in my eyes.
