@_subject: Help: Copied gnupg folder not recognised 
I copied ~/.gnupg from my old machine, because I want to copy all keys,
trust data etc. [1]
However, on my new machine, nothing seems to be recognising the GnuPG
* "gnupg --list-keys" is empty ("gnupg --help" confirms that ~/.gnupg
is the folder being used)
* The "GnuPG keys" pane of "GNOME Password and Keys" is empty
* Email client is not able to encrypt/decrypt messages
How can I diagnose what the problem is? Failing that, how can I
export/import an entire .gnupg folder (including trust data)?
