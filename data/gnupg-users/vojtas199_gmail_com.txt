@_subject: Problem with generating Brainpool P-512 
I have encountered quite unusual problem.
I had been able to already generate brainpool keys but it is quite a
time ago but when I try to generate them now the gpg fails with
??? gpg: signing failed: Invalid length
??? gpg: make_keysig_packet failed: Invalid length
??? Key generation failed: Invalid length
??? [GNUPG:] ERROR key_generate 67109003
??? [GNUPG:] KEY_NOT_CREATED
and in syslog I have found this
??? gpg-agent[pid]: a 256 bit hash is not valid for a 512 bit ECC key
??? gpg-agent[pid]:command 'PKSIGN' failed: Invalid length
Full debug in paste I would appreciate any input
Best regards
