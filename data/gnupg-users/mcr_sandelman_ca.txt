Does this mean that documents signed decades ago with PGP2 can no longer
be verified?
If so, I guess this is a reason to keep GPG classic around for verification
purposes only.

I agree that one's confidence in that content should be suspect, but the
value is not zero.  I am happy that you have removed the support,
btw. Simpler code is important.

Yes, that was idea too -- just use 1.4.
And one can't re-encrypt data signed by another.
In many cases, in my archives, I have email that is clear signed, which was
then encrypted, and stored that way.
