I post a bug report for a similar problem a couple of days ago. I find out that gnupg clear signatures cannot be verified by pgp 5.0i while
"not clear" signatures work. I finally find out that the problem came
from tab chars.
The following file clearsigned with gpg cannot be verified by pgp
5.0i. If you substitute the final tab with a space then everything is

@_subject: Cannot revoke signature 
I'm trying to revoke a signature with GnuPG 1.2.0 but I didn't
First I create a revokation certificat using :
$ gpg --output revokation.asc --gen-rev KEYID
A revokation certificat is created but when I tried to import it I
always get the following error :
$ gpg --import revokation.asc gpg: key KEYID: invalid revocation certificate: general error - rejected
gpg: error reading `revokation.asc': general error
gpg: import from `revokation.asc' failed: general error
gpg: Total number processed: 0
What I'm I doing wrong ?
