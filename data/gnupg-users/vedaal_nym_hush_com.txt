There are many different ways to approach storing a revocation ( I have a special key in a safety deposit box, that is a 'designated revoker' for all my other keys. )
Here is an option to do what you want without remembering any other passphrases except for the secret key you already have:
[1] Encrypt any file (preferably a very short text message so that you can type the ciphertext as backup) to your existing key.
[2] Decrypt the file with the option of --show-session-key .
[3] Copy the 64 character session key to use as the passphrase to  symmetrically encrypt your revocation certificate.
(you can't get a more secure passphrase, ;-)   )
[4] Store your symmetrically encrypted revocation certificate, and the encrypted file from step [1] in a location you consider safe for your threat models.

The 'throw-keyids' option hides which keys the message is encrypted (beware of this option, as it is useful only under  very limited i.e.  posting anonymously in a newsgroup like alt.test, and where your threat model doesn't include government agencies or organized crime, so you can communicate by encryption but without using e-
The reason to *not* use this option, is that it can be used by government to get access to all your keys and passwords!
The government can claim, that in order to prove that you did not encrypt this, it must try all the keys in your possession, and in order to make sure that you didn't intentionally enter the 'wrong' password, it needs to enter the correct one.
(The prosecutor may graciously allow you to change your passwords to temporary ones for this purpose, but if they can copy the key, then it won't really help you  ;-) ).
In fact, if one wanted to think 'really paranoid', then in a country where there is a law where people must surrender an encryption key upon demand to decrypt a message, then what prevents an intelligence agency from 'planting' a throw-keyid encrypted message on your computer by simply e-mailing it to you from an anonymous e-mail account?  The message can be done with keys that only the intelligence agency has, and since you really didn't encrypt the message, you can't give up the session key, and now the government wants *all* your keys and passwords to prove you didn't encrypt the message.
(Actually, you might try a defense that forcing you to try to decrypt a throw-keyid message using all the keys in your possession is already a violation of 'cruel and unusual punishment'  ;-) )
[2] hiding the identity of the signer:
(a) generate a new keypair and give it to a person you want to have 'plausible deniability' with
(b) a signed message shown to anyone else, only means that 'one' of you signed it. Both of you know which one 'really' signed it,

then pgp6.5.8 will automatically use CAST5 when generating that (AFAIK, you *cannot* generate a v3 RSA key in gnupg for many versions now, and pgp6 will not recognize v4 RSA keys, so you must use the --pgp6 option when generating a key, and gnupg will automatically pick an old style dh key for you.)

Unfortunately, such *reasonable* monsters (or even 'not such monsters , UK for example)
can exploit the throw-keyid feature to obtain the secret keys of anyone (in the UK).
Suppose some people are in the habit of sending gnupg encrypted e-
mails in the UK
If the reasonable British intelligence people decided that they wanted anyone's secret keys and passwords, they could simply do something like following:
[1] Anonymously send the person whose keys they want, a throw-keyid encrypted message, which is in reality encrypted to a key of their own choosing that no one else has access to
[2] Ask the person to decrypt the message
[3] The person will claim, quite truthfully, (and as expected by British intelligence), that he can't, since it probably wasn't encrypted to his key.
[4] They can claim, quite plausibly, that he entered the wrong password intentionally so that he would not have to reveal the true contents of the message
[5] They can now make a case that in order to know that the person really can't decrypt, they need the secret keys and passwords to every key on the keyring, so that they can, in front of the court, try each one and make sure the message really cannot be decrypted by any of the person's keys.
[6] They can even offer the defendant an opportunity to temporarily change the password to anything of his choice, just for the purposes of the demonstration, and then change it back, and decrypt it in front of the judge,
but by this time, with some easily available non-invasive stealth video recording technology, they will already have access to the secret key ring, and a functional password to each key. personally I don't think the British are anywhere near this strict about such things,
but if they ever did decide to be, the mechanism by which they could make it stick, is there.

then generate a test key for this purpose, with the passphrase blank, and send it to pgpdump.
But, if you are suspecting gnupg (or any openpgp implementation), of generating a composite key with a secret prime factor that the implementation can use for master decryption, then there is an easier way for them to accomplish this, in a way where the the prime numbers are definitely primes, but the program can still All that is necessary, is to use pre-canned primes, (i.e. to generate a prime which falls within a range of primes stored in an offsite area by the implementation.)
The decryption can be accomplished with relatively little difficulty, by checking all the pre-canned primes, which would be much, much fewer, [but still large enough that someone using the program, would not be likely to generate duplicate keys].
Short of thoroughly checking the source code, this would not be and if you are already checking the gnupg sourcecode, you can see that the generation of primes for keys is quite impeccably done ;-)

The approximate equivalent in brute force work is 20 diceware [ 7776^19 < 2^256 < 7776^20 ].

Does increasing the passphrase string to more than 64 characters add any security?
Truecrypt full disk encryption insists on a maximum of 64 characters for the passphrase.

The 'shared' key is only the secret key. Anyone, (even someone who has no share at all, i.e. an outside client of the company) can encrypt to the public key.
Usually though, 'shared' keys are used for 'signing' documents, proposals, orders, instructions, etc. that require a majority of the governing board, and the shares are set to that number of the majority required to pass the vote. It's less likely that ordinary documents or client files need decryption by a shared secret key, but is possible if the company wanted an 'excuse' to not decrypt the files, and intentionally did it this way.
If it were an 'excuse' though, and they really do need access to the files, then it's probably encrypted somewhere else too, where they 'can' decrypt, or there are some 'shares' stored away somewhere ...
If you're lucky, and they happened to sign anything with the shared key after the time they claimed not to be able to reconstruct the key, then you caught them.

set PGPHome = home
and saved this as pgp64.bat
(I have both pgp 2.6.3m6 and gnupg 1.4.11 on a flash drive, and they both run on 64 bit windows systems from a command line dos window, without having pgp or gnupg installed.)
For 'gnupg64.bat' the first line of the above two lines should set GNUPGHOME=home
As mobile phones become bundled with OSes, it shouldn't be long before gnupg can be run on a mobile.

something like it, right? The Prime Number Theorem:
Pi(x) ~ x/ln(x)
(Pi(x) refers to the number of primes up to and including the integer x
~ means approximately.
Formally, the proof is for Lim x-->infinity  Pi(x)/[x/ln(x)] = 1
There is an interesting related Prime Number theorem that might help you eliminate which intervals of numbers need to be factored:
For any positive integer n, there exists an integer a, such that the n consecutive integers:
[ a, a+1, a+2, ..., a+(n-1)] are all composite.
a = (n+1)! + 2
(For anyone interested, the proof is in a free and easily readable, downloadable text on Elementary Number Theory by W. Edwin Clark

Now, while there is no simple formula that can generate all primes, it is very simple to generate factorials for all n up to the point where n! is less than the square root of 2^4096.
So, in your spare time, ;-)  you can eliminate a large amount of intervals where factoring is unnessary.
(But even after all that, you may find that a 4096 bit key is still pretty much unfactorable for the not-too-near future. ;-)  )

The same principle works very easily with:

For all the work that you DO do, you certainly shouldn't have to do anything EXTRA you have np need for.
So, if I can make things even a little easier, I was able to compile a windows binary for gnupg.1.4.11 from the listed sourcecode without too much difficulty,
so am posting this for whomever it might be helpful.
If anyone has any corrections please post, Thanks.
Compiling your own windows binary on windows (for people who never used a compiler):
First, download the gnupg 1.x source code from the gnupg.org site, and verify the signature and checksum.
Then download MINGW and MSYS from sourceforge,
(click on 'Download mingw-get-inst-20110802.exe (579.4 kB)' , this will install all the necessary files).
When installing, make sure that MSYS is checked off in the installer. The default is NOT to install it. It is much easier to compile things once MSYS is installed, as it allows the './configure' command to use the gnupg sourcecode to produce everything necessary for the makefile. The Installer links MSYS to MINGW automatically.
By default, the installer installs to C:\MinGW and installs msys as a subdirectory of C:\MinGW.
Unpack the sourcecode, and for the sake of example in these instructions, rename it gnupgxyzFMC and copy it to c:\gnupgxyzFMC (FMC = For Mingw Compiling  ;-) )
Go to the msys subdirectory of c:\MinGW and click on the subdirectory of 1.0, then on msys.bat.
The MinGW-Msys compiler window opens and lists your logon name, Type: cd /c:/gnupgxyzFMC and press enter.
Type: ./configure --prefix=/mingw  and press enter.
The compiler checks the sourcecode files for the downloaded 1.x gnupg version and configures it for compilation on windows using minGW, and after many many lines, ends with the following:
config.status: creating po/Makefile
(n.b. if you're on 64 bit windows, the above line may be different)
type: make  and press enter.
After the compiler finishes and the $ prompt is shown again, the only thing left to do is to, is to type: make install  and press enter.
After the compiler finishes, type: gpg --version  and press enter,
and it displays: gpg (GnuPG) 1.4.11
The compiler has succesfully installed gpg.exe, gpgsplit.exe, gpgv.exe, and gpg-zip into C:\MinGW\bin
and these can now be copied into whatever homedirectory you want.
Again, my primary interest in this is to update Maxine Brandt's GPG-
to-GO site, in the event that windows binaries for 1.x might not If anyone has a simpler way of doing this, or any other suggestions, please post,

Johan Wevers johanw at vulcan.xs4all.nl Because then who is to say that it wasn't tampered with?
The whole point is to start with gnupg.org signed and verified material, and then let the user take it from there.
Although, [and am over my head here, so please correct if wrong],
if there *could* be a way of providing instructions on compiling, so that the resultant compiled file would always have the same then it might make sense to host the compiled binary and the hash.
My understanding, (which may be outdated),
is that there are too many variations in individual user systems, so that the compiled files would  never have 'exactly' the same hash independent of where they are compiled.
Is there any way to ensure that if the same source code and the same compiler is used, that the resultant files have the same hash?

from source using Cygwin or MingW, I'd feel safer if someone who
knew what they were doing did it.
1.4.11 when compiled from cygwin, works ok on windows, but only within cygwin.
It WON'T work on a flashdrive that's attached to any windows system where cygwin isn't installed, as it needs some cygwin-specific 1.4.11 from mingw, will work anywhere, and is VERY EASY to compile from the posted instructions,
(I'm not a real programmer either, and only recently have been able to successfully do 'Hello World' from Python and Perl, and haven't graduated to C yet ;-))  )
(Compiling from mingw according to the posted instructions, is easier than setting up gpgshell on a flashdrive, which isn't that hard, and is something you have already done), so try it ;-).
There is a unique advantage to running gnupg from cygwin on windows, as it's the only way to make use of unix-like commands,
(cat, grep, printf, etc.) and pipe them to and from gnupg.
But, if you want a possibly 'more secure' flashdrive gnupg setup that lets you do everything, you can install ubuntu on a (big) usb drive, boot from the usb, and run gnupg from ubuntu.
Boot from an ubuntu pocket dvd, and keep your keys and stuff on the usb , and write (encrypt or decrypt) to the usb.

I am not familiar with TrampCrypt, and cannot offer any guidance about it, but here are some speculations about how you might accomplish your goals, with the caveat that you accept all the risks involved,
(and, communicating those risks to whoever is trusting your advice and allowing their sensitive information to be communicated.) :
[1] Setup gnupg on a usb disk, and boot the adhoc computer from a static cd or dvd (e.g., an Ubuntu install disk to run in 'demo' [2] The Ubuntu Demo can read files on the adhoc computer, both in FAT, and NTFS systems, (and can even access any file on a windows system, without any administrative privilege necessary).
[3] Create a hierarchy of users who wish to communicate with each and give them all the same password,  (a random string of sufficient length that the users will need to write down.  A simple way to do this, is to encrypt any file with gnupg, and then decrypt using the option of '--show-session-key' , and using the session key string as the passphrase, and then supplying it to all users of this hierarchy.)
[4] Encryption and decryption of files can then be done symmetrically, by the users, with very minimal effort.
(i) To encrypt:  gpg -c -a filename
(ii) To decrypt: gpg encrypted filename
(it's not necessary to use a specific 'decrypt' command, gpg will 'understand' from the file that it's encrypted and ask the user for the passphrase).
[5] If a user wants to communicate with users from other hierarchies, give that user the passphrase for that hierarchy, and impress upon the user to 'not get the passphrases mixed up'.  ;-)
All unencrypted data will be written only to the usb.
This system is doable but has 'many' potential flaws, of which only a few are listed here:
-keyloggers capturing everything by someone targeting the adhoc -malware attacks on the usb, if used for any purpose on any other -exposure of sensitive information if the usb is lost or stolen.
-losing the written passhrase, or, worse, having it copied without the user's knowledge.
Here is a site on how to build a standalone gnupg on a usb:
(If you want to, you can put this on a usb with a bootable ubuntu system and boot directly from the usb, if you adhoc computers allow for this).
Final, (and most important), caveat:
You are the judge of what your threat model is, and what the potential risks you are subjecting the unsuspecting users to.
These users are *trusting* you with their sensitive information, but are *blind* as to the problems that may occur.
It is far, far worse to communicate using encryption, expecting that privacy will be maintained, when unknown  to the user, it may not be, than not to communicate at all.
Do not place such a 'stumbling block' before the 'blind'.

The one sending the message really is in control here ;-)
The sender can use hidden encrypt to ANY public key.
i.e. if Alice is sending the message and wants to hide her nothing prevents her from using throw-keyid with Bob's public key instead of her own, or NIST's, or PGP Corporation's, or any onyone If the message is unsigned, the receiver cannot tell,
(assuming it's sent from an appropriately anonymized e-mail and if it is signed, then the throw -keyid doesn't hide the sender's identity from the receiver.

@_subject: how vulnerable is "hidden-encrypt-to" 
The simplest way to do that is to send the message encrypted to only one recipient at a time.
Now, if the sender *wanted* to mislead, she could, in addition to sending encrypted messages to the 'real' people she wanted to send to, she could also use hidden-encrypt to anyone else's public key, and send people on a wild chase of trying to see who else it was encrypted to.
I'm not sure about this.
The way RSA works, is that the session key has *padding* added before it is encrypted to a public key.
It may even have *different* padding for each public key it is encrypted to in the same gnupg command.
(Maybe those who really know about this, could comment if the padding is the same or different for each public key RSA encrypted packet in one encrypted gnupg message).
If so, and there is different padding, then you will not be able to determine whose key it is just by trying to re-encrypt the session key to a trial list of public keys, and comparing the ciphertext.
Even if it is not so, (i.e. that there is no 'different' padding), it will not be easy for an average user to re-encrypt, as (afaik), gnupg doesn't list the padding upon decryption.
(It could be done though, by decrypting that packet directly with RSA tools,
but probably not by the averaqe user :-)  ...  )

It is.  See RFC4880, (it's one of the 'MUST' implementations for all open-pgp's) (specific sections will be quoted below)
Even the experts should not be able to.
See the quoted sections below.
=====[ begin quoted sections ]=====
5.1.  Public-Key Encrypted Session Key Packets (Tag 1)
Note that when an implementation forms several PKESKs with one
session key, forming a message that can be decrypted by several    the implementation MUST make a new PKCS encoding for each key.
7.2 RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5
* It is recommended that the pseudorandom octets in step 2 in
      Section 7.2.1 be generated independently for each encryption
      process, especially if the same data is input to more than       encryption process.  Haastad's results [24] are one motivation for
      this recommendation.
    * The padding string PS in step 2 in Section 7.2.1 is at least       octets long, which is a security condition for public-key
      operations that makes it difficult for an attacker to recover       by trying all possible encryption blocks.
13.1.1.  EME-PKCS1-v1_5-ENCODE
   Input:
   k  = the length in octets of the key modulus
   M  = message to be encoded, an octet string of length mLen,         mLen <= k - 11
   Output:
   EM = encoded message, an octet string of length k
   Error:   "message too long"
     1. Length checking: If mLen > k - 11, output "message too long" and
        stop.
     2. Generate an octet string PS of length k - mLen - 3 consisting of
        pseudo-randomly generated nonzero octets.  The length of PS         be at least eight octets.
     3. Concatenate PS, the message M, and other padding to form an
        encoded message EM of length k octets as
        EM = 0x00 || 0x02 || PS || 0x00 || M.
     4. Output EM.

If you are interested in looking into this rigorously further, I recommend you contact Professor Dan Boneh.
(He is an authority on RSA, teaches a free online Cryptography course at Stanford University, and has a clear style and is reasonably accessible.)

"having a single trusted introducer who serves as the gatekeeper for the entire system this problem goes away."
Medical or Technical firms using encryption, cannot afford to have their data unencryptable when they themselves need it, and so, may resort to one of two general solutions:
[1] ADK's (additional decryption keys) for each employee.
(PGP and some commercial implementations offer them, Gnupg does [2] ALL keys within the company, for all employees, are generated by one sys-admin, who has the copies and passphrases, and gives, to each employee, that employee's keypair, as well as each other employee's public key.
(Maybe Rob can comment on other alternate ways of setting up such IF Alice trusts the sys-admin to not do anything malicious,
(i.e. mis-using her key or others to forge anything, and doesn't mind that the administration will be able to decrypt anyone's encrypted message having to do with company or group matters),
it is very easy to accomplish this through gnupg.
The sys-admin generates all the keys, and distributes the keyrings.
Each keyring has that individual employee's keypair, as well as all the other employee's public keys. Each key has 'ultimate' trust.
No other WOT issues need to be involved.
Once Alice gets comfortable with gnupg, and wants to use encryption under wider circumstances, and for personal communication, she can then learn the other issues on how to do this safely.
(She can find us on the web, and join this mailing list or others like it, and learn at her own pace ;-)  ).

@_subject: OT: USB key with hardware encryption? 
have never used any hardware encrypted USB, but here is a workaround you might find helpful:
[1] Instead of encrypting the entire USB, put several truecrypt voulmes on the USB, and leave a good amount of empty space on the USB , (e.g. 4 gig) , that you don't use for anything but the files you want to print or scan.
[2] Burn a dvd of *UPR with TAILS*. (Ubuntu Privacy Remix with The Amnesic Incognito Live System)
(It's available directly as an burn-ready iso image.)
This uses a modified bootable run-from-dvd version of Unbuntu 10.x  (UPR calls it 'Locked Lynx' ), which has Truecrypt and GnuPG 1.4.10 installed on it. It also has a front end for gnupg.  Upon booting, it can mount whatever truecrypt files you want, and write/encrypt/decrypt directly into the truecrypt volume, or do any gnupg operations on any file on the USB itself. It has a 'wipe original' option, but am not sure what kind of 'wiping' is involved, but if your threat model is only some random person who may find the USB you lost in a public place, it might be sufficient for you.
[3] Boot from the dvd, mount the truecrypt file that has whatever you want to print, and copy it to the empty space in the USB
[4] Reboot from your work computer and print the files you want, and scan whatever you want into the empty space on the USB.
[5] Reboot from the dvd, mount the truecypt volume and copy everything back into the truecrypt volume.
[5] Encrypt and Wipe the files left on the empty space on the USB, (encrypting into the truecrypt volume, and wiping the files on the non-truecrypt space on the USB), dismount the truecrypt volume and shut down.
Some quirks on the UPR-TAILS system:
[1] The gnupg front end does not have a conventional encryption option, so it needs a key to encrypt to. (You can import your own, but it's simpler and safer to just let the front end generate one for you, since you are mainly interested in the 'wipe original' option. You don't need to save the key, and it's simple enough to generate one key each time you need to use the system.)
[2] The front-end keeps the passphrase for the key in memory for the entire time the system is booted.
(I haven't found any way to set a time for it or turn it off). Working from the commandline 1.4.10 doesn't keep the passphrase in memory, and works pretty much as expected, but doesn't have the 'wipe' option.
[3] The size of the UPR-TAILS system is 'just a little bit bigger' than a pocket size mini-dvd, and needs to be burned to a full-size dvd.
[4] The truecrypt volume doesn't dismount from the ordinary truecrypt window, but needs to be right-clicked on in the ubuntu file browser, and dismounted from the truecrypt option in the right-click drop down menu.

That's why I came up with the md5sum of the files contents in the first place - I already have the mapping table (the summary file). If that's no good idea, I will probably just use a GUID for each file and create a separate mapping table (which also won't get uploaded without encryption:)
If you don't mind *really. really long* entries  ;-)  in your re-naming table, you can do something like the following, and never have to worry about the mapping table getting lost.
Encrypt the actual filename symmetrically,  add the resulting ciphertext to the end of the file, and then save the resultant encrypted file with encrypted ciphertext as fn1.asc and the ciphertext of the filename in the mapping table for fn1.asc
after doing gpg --cipher-algo AES256 -c -a real_filename
resulting in something like:
$ printf "real_filename" | gpg --cipher-algo AES256 -c -a
Resulting in
(passphrase; sss)
Add the above ciphertext, with the header and footer intact,  to the bottom of the ciphertext of the encrypted actual file, and save the whole thing as fn1.asc, and similarly, for the rest, as fn2.asc, fn3.asc, ... ,  fnn.asc .
In your mapping table, fn1.asc    would be   jA0ECQMCMu4SzytLjoFg0kIBlWVEKygTWNEjNi/sc/Anvc10SokQC9X6k2GZz1py
If your mapping table ever gets lost, you can easily recover the filename by decrypting the added ciphertext at the end of each encrypted file.

Here's a sort-of workaround, (inelegant, but can be tweaked and  improved on if it's something desirable) :
[1] The person who wants to create a new key, first generates a symmetrically encrypted gnupg message, and decrypts it and gets the session key.
[2] Hash the [(preferred key name)+(seesion key)+(e-mail address)]
[3] Generate the key with the uid of [(preferred key name)+(session key)+(e-mail address)]
[4] Identify the key to the server by the hash.
These steps would defeat harvesting tools enumerating the low entropy names and hash ranges.
(Am not advocating this, just pointing out a possible approach if you want to take this further.
Personally, I agree with David Shaw, that the problem can be avoided by just generating a random UID (maybe a truncated session key) and giving the fingerprint and UID to anyone who wants to look it up on the keyserver, as well as the e-mail address separately to whomever the user wants to correspond with.)
Have never received any keyserver id related spam on some of my old V3 keys that are used only for remailer list correspondence and have been on keyservers for well over a decade.

And leaves the encrypted message on his own website, so that whoever he decides to give the passphrase to, can easily recover the session key.
It's about randomness that can't be brute forced by today's attack resources, but easily communicatable.
whatever their preferred e-mail name is,
i.e,  alice.surname at domainname.com
the actual hash of the [name+sessionkey at domainname.com]
SHA256 of alice.surnameACed72...F at domainnamne.com
Here there are 2 ways to go
(a) create the key with the uid of alice.surnameACed72...F at domainnamne.com  and send it to the keyserver, with instructions to index it by its hash as the only search criteria
(major headache for backward compatibility, as you rightly pointed (b) create the key with uid as the hash itself
SHA256 of alice.surnameACed72...F at domainnamne.com
This poses no backward compatibility problems, and is easily computable by someone who knows Alice's name, e-mail address and passphrase to the symmetrically encrypted message she posted on her it makes the 'anonymous' key id less likely to be duplicated,
i.e. BE452FD9
but is basically the same idea as your's and David's
it seems easier to just give the fingerprint ;-)

but it's a possible doable approach ...

Main user arguments in holding onto pgp 2.x, isn't some bizarre nostalgia, (they are willing to use Diastry's version which accepts all hashes gnupg accepts (not just md5) and , except for Camellia, all symmetric algorithms that gnupg accepts).
( I haven't used classic pgp2 since the first Disastry verion came These are people who actually read each line of the source code of I've asked in the past, if there could be a 'minimalist' gnupg version, (e.g., using only RSA, 3DES, SHA1, and SHA 256 and maybe only vintage necessary gnupg options) so that the source code is small enough that someone can read it from scratch in a reasonable amount of time (and not dependent on 'just keeping up with the It would still be compatible with current gnupg, which would, by default, honor the 3DES preferences in the 'minimalist' version.
( I wish I were fluent in C, and could write patches myself, and cannibalize the early versions of gnupg, and come up with a draft of code that just needs to be audited, fixed, and vetted, instead of begging for features, but I'm not anywhere near ready :-(((  ,
so I understand the futility/arrogance of asking for so much work to be done, and for free, and am 'not pushing' it. )
In any event, I have other newer keys, and rarely use my v3 key except for people who insist on it.

I'm not now, (and have not been since the ADK v4 bug was fixed ;-) ), advocating that people should generate v3 keys as a choice.
Anyone new to crypto, should definitely use only a v4 key.
As you mentioned earlier, the v3 people have an entrenched user-
base, and are hardly novices, and 'for them', listing the keysize with the fingerprint, really is trivial.
(I never called it a 'fix'. It's an easily describable and do-able workaround for people who need their v3's for their preferred cryptosystem.)

WK said that the new libcrypt will support idea.  Gnupg 2.x allows importing v3 keys.
I have a great many encrypted e-mails and files that were done with v3 keys, (some of them by people no longer in the land of the living ;-((  )
It is useful to be able to decrypt them, and nostalgic to see their verified signatures, and am thankful to WK for allowing this in gnupg 1.x, and soon in gnupg 2.x.

@_subject: please give us safer defaults for gnupg 
All of his reasons are easily countered. In the interests of time and space, I'll just address the following ones:
2. The OpenPGP Format: You might aswell run around the city naked.
3. Transaction Data: Mallory knows who you are talking to.
8. PGP conflates non-repudiation and authentication
First, as a general approach to encryption and authentication, it's important to recognize that there are several levels why a user may want to encrypt and/or authenticate.
The simplest level:
[a] It's not really important, but it's nobody else's business either.
This is equivalent to sending a message in an envelope rather than a post-card, except that in PGP, it's easier for users to confirm that the sender and the recipient are who they are, than in the case of snail-mail through an envelope, or ordinary e-mail.
The next level:
[b] It's important, and the sender stands behind the information, and is willing to have the receiver vouch for the signature or send it on with the signature intact, to whoever needs to take action on the information.
A more serious level:
[c] It's very important, and needs to be kept confidential as to who sent it, who received it, and needs repudiation as to who signed it.
There are several ways that, with a little effort,  open-pgp can be used to do this. Here is one suggestion:
(i) The sender and receiver each generate a key of typical size (2048 or 4096) but do not ever post it to a key server. Instead they exchange it, either in person, or by having it posted encrypted to the intended recipient's key, using the throw-keyid option, to a website or newsgroup that allows encrypted postings.
(The reason 'typical size' is mentioned, is that the throw-keyid option does not hide the 'size' of the key, so if you happen to be the only one on the internet who decided to generate a cool atypical key of 3693, it will be pretty obvious who is behind the message, even with the throw-keyid used. It's also possible for someone to intentionally 'frame' you for the message  ;-)   ).
(ii) The sender and receiver also generate a separate signing key that they give to each other, that they can each use, and post it as in (i).
(iii) Messages can now be signed with the key generated in (ii), hidden-encrypted to the key generated in (i), put on a small clean usb, and posted anonymously from a public place to the website or newsgroup, and then physically destroy the usb.
Depending on how serious the requirements are, the more precautions need to be taken.
i.e.  generating and decrypting pgp messages only on a machine never connected to the internet and under physical security at all times;
posting from different public wifi sites with different laptops, etc.   depending on the threat model.
To borrow from the racing car analogy used earlier in this thread:
GnuPG  provides an extremely high performance sturdy vehicle that can be used for ordinary shopping as well as high speed off road chases ...  ;-)
There are enough capabilities and workarounds in GnuPG, to do almost anything a user wants to do in terms of storing, sending or authenticating any messages or files.
Thanks again, to WK and the GnuPG team.

@_subject: [Announce] [security fix] GnuPG 1.4.16 released // workaround 
Am not familiar with how RSA 'blinding' works, but am surprised that it cannot be used to 'blind' RSA as to the identity of the key ;-(
Here is a potential workaround though:
If a sender suspects that the receiver may be in a place where acoustical surveillance can detect the key id, then the sender and receiver can do the following:
[1] The sender sends a message encrypted to both the sender's and receiver's usual keys,
with an instruction in the plaintext, that if a 'special  atypical' key is to be used, then the message is to be sent encrypted to that special atypical key, using the throw-keyid option, as well as encrypting conventionally to a passphrase.
[2] The passphrase to be used for conventional encryption is the session key string for the first encrypted message in [1], which the sender and receiver now have, and they can decrypt the messages using conventional encryption.
[3] Whenever the correspondents are in an environment 'safe' from this type of acoustic threat, the message can be decrypted using the 'special typical' key.  Whatever information is intended to be conveyed by using a 'special key', will still be understood by the receiver.

Haven't done this in an actual print on business card paper, but here is a suggestion:
[1] Export the public key
[2] Import in into an Open Office txt. document
[3] Change the font to 'OCR A Extended' at 2 pt. type (it wont let you do 1 pt. type)
[4] Export it as a pdf
I used a 4096 public key, which fits easily on a business card,
and you can add the fingerprint and key ID by changing the version and comment lines:
Instead of the Version and Comment lines, you can put:
KeyID: long Key id   Fingerprint; actual fingerprint of 40 characters with spaces between blocks of 4
As long as you include the colon and a space after the colon, gnupg will import it with only a minor comment of:
'unknown armor header'
Here is a pdf of my key done this way:
n.b PDF treats an empty line as 'whitespace' and when the pdf is copied and pasted as text, the empty line between the fingerprint comment and the key block will be omitted.
Add the empty line (GnuPG will import it anyway without it, if you forget to ;-)  )
The entire keyblock will fit on the back of an index card.
Now, for the 'real' problem with all this:
On what type of paper, and how should it be printed, so that it will be durable and scanable and importable without scanning errors ?

So, if it's probably not safe to do credit cards/payments on a rooted phone,
 it might be prudent not to trust encryption to a rooted phone, even if the encryption apps themselves have been reviewed and vetted,
especially if someone has more than one app needing root access.
As phones are increasing in memory and processing power,
maybe an app could be developed to use a smart card usb reader on a phone.

@_subject: More secure than smartcard or cryptostick against remote attacks? 
There is a bigger problem with a pdf, that if, once a hash algorithm becomes insecure enough that pre-image collisions are possible, it is possible to forge a signature.
Ordinarily, even if a collision is possible, a forgery of a signature over text, would instantly be detectable, as the collision forgery would have gibberish in the text.
M1 has signature hash S1
M2 = (m3 + string),  where m3 is the forged text, and the string added, is a string additional characters that are varied until a collision is found for the same S1 hash.
The string stands out as gibberish and would be questioned, even if the signature verified.
But now, in pdf form, the string can easily be hidden in the pdf, by having the string embedded as white text instead of black, and not distinguishable from the white space background.
M1 is a pdf of a table, or spreadsheet, or has equations or different language special characters, where it is reasonable to be sent as a pdf.
M2 =  Pdf of (m3 + string),  where is m3 is the forged data in the table, or other visible area of the pdf, and the string is the found addition that produced a successful collision for the final pdf, after having the string rendered in 1 pt. font in white color embedded in any convenient place in the pdf.
M1 does not even have to be on a pdf, as long as it has a detached .sig S1.
If pre-image collisions are possible for a hash, then  a pdf can be constructed to have the same. sig S1.
(This could still be detected by examining the details of the metadata of the pdf and seeing what 'extra' material was embedded, but only if a habit is made of checking the metadata very carefully.)

Back in the shrouded mists of time, in the last millenium, before digital media were widely accessible, many libraries and archives used to back up data on microfiche.
Many of them had built in printers, so that 'text' data could be retrieved, printed out, (and then, as the technology became widely available), scanned into digital format.
The above article gives the following interesting (?overly optimistic?) durability estimate:
=====[ begin quote ]=====
The polyester material on which the images are printed is also very stable and, if kept in a temperature controlled environment, is estimated to last as long as 500 years.
 CD-ROMs are estimated to last for about 75 - 100 years, depending on the materials they are made of and how they are stored.
=====[ end quote ]=====
(as an old darkroom B&W hobbyist, I remember specific instructions on how to prepare prints for 'Archival Quality' [adjust development time so that the print could tolerate 2 minutes in a fixer tray without overly darkening],
this produced an estimate then of 75 year durability.)
Preserving only monochrome text probably has much greater durability.

Which would mean that GnuPG wouldn't need any overhaul of standards to move from a default of SHA-1 to SHA-256,
(although it might involve making changes to the crypto library that GnuPG uses for RSA).
After thinking about it some more, though, it doesn't seem like much of a threat to continue SHA-1,
(or at least, less important for GnuPG to concern itself, than with the SHA-1 involved in the fingerprint.)
GnuPg uses RSA padding  only to encrypt and decrypt the random session key.
All other encryption is done by symmetric algorithms and doesn't involve RSA and its padding.
As the session key is random, it isn't vulnerable to a plain-text attack, and might not need any padding at all,
and so, the hash function used for the padding isn't such an issue...

In the US today, the HIPPA regulations forbid sending medically related information unencrypted. This is true even for Special Education school children getting a short e-mail from a therapist.
Employees can and do get 'suspended without pay ' for repeated violations.
Hushmail has a way to send Open-PGP encrypted mail to someone not using encryption.
The receiver is directed to a Hushmail website and has to answer a question that the sender and receiver agreed upon, in order to decrypt the message. The receiver is allowed only 3 tries, and the message is removed from the server within 72 hours after successful decryption.
People who have used this, have the initial reaction that ' This Is COOL. I want to try it'.
One such person did, and wound up storing her special files, encrypted, in a Husmail file-storage option, and now 'loves' encryption.
Hushmail though, DOES have a backdoor, and a few years ago, admitted it, and gave up the key to law enforcement.
Maybe a GnuPG based Hushmail type e-mail system, for a reasonable fee, with NO backdoor, might work.

What kind of relationship is there between the number listed for the 'unknown algorithm' and the passphrase string that was given,
and might this be used in any way to try attack gnupg by determining the length of the passphrase or the correctness of any character in the string ?

The error message on Ubuntu, or on Cygwin in Win 7  is just:

This is still unusual, as gnupg already identified it as TWOFISH, not as an unknown algorithm,

@_subject: Unusual (unintended?) behavor upon decryption of a message 
But this isn't the way hybrid gnupg messages work.
If a message is encrypted to two different keys,
gnupg will use the same symmetric algorithm to encrypt the session key to the public key, and also the plaintext to the ciphertext.
If the message is encrypted to one public key, and also encrypted symmetrically instead of to a second public key, then the symmetric algorithm used by gnupg is the same for the encryption of the session key to the public key, as well as the session key to the symmetrically encrypted part, as well as the encryption of the plaintext.
Gnupg does not use one symmetric algorithm to encrypt the session key, and then another to encrypt the message.
The user can choose 'which' symmetric algorithm to use, but it will be the same for both.
The symmetric algorithm is known, and is discoverable from gpg list-packets or from pgp-dump.
My question is, is there oracle behavior on gnupg's part which will allow an attack on the string-to-key part of the symmetric encryption?
If an attacker knows which symmetric algorithm was used, then concentrating of the first few characters of the passphrase, and trying variations of those, until gnupg identifies the correct algorithm, then gnupg may 'leak' the first few characters of the passphrase when the correct algorithm is identified, even if the message is not yet decrypted.

Sorry, was not writing clearly ;-((
Meant to say that the session key together with the prefix denoting which symmetric algorithm was used to encrypt the plaintext, is encrypted to the public key (using either RSA, DH, (or, hopefully soon, ECC),
and also as a symmetrically encrypted packet containing the session key and identifying algorithm prefix,
and then the symmetrically encrypted plaintext packet.
These two latter symmetrically encrypted packets, while the could  'theoretically' be using two different symmetric algorithms,
in fact use the same one, and that is the one identified as the algorithm used to encrypt the plaintext.

 Here is a symmetrical test message to try out:
Copy this into notepad, or any editor, and then add the line before the message and the line after the message to result in the following:
" " | gpg -d
Copy the above segment into clipboard.
Now open the MSYS window, and type;
printf (and add a space afterward)
Now, right-click on the border of the MSYS window, and a dropdown menu aooears,
click on 'edit' then on 'paste'  and press enter
gpg then does the following:

@_subject: The symmetric ciphers 
If the keys are different, and the algorithms different, then it would seem that there is a major advantage to re-encrypting the ciphertext,
('cascading' is the term Truecrypt uses for this.)
The advantage is,
that if it should ever be possible to brute force the keyspace of one key, then NONE of the possible elements of the keyspace (including the *correct* key) will result in an identifiable *correct* plaintext. It will only result in random ciphertext.
(This is different than ROT(10) followed by ROT(16), because it can be broken by brute forcing ROT(x, ; 0Of course there is one well-known encryption product that offers Truecrypt allows only AES, Twofish, and Serpent for encryption and cascading.
(Whether this is because there is a potential flaw in using other algorithms, or whether it is simply too much work for the developers to provide cascading for all algortihms, I do not know.)
Here is the description in the Truecrypt documentation:
=====[begin quote]=====
 AES-Twofish-Serpent
Three ciphers in a cascade [15, 16] operating in XTS mode (see the section Modes of Operation). Each 128-bit block is first encrypted with Serpent (256-bit key) in XTS mode, then with Twofish (256-bit key) in XTS mode, and finally with AES (256-bit key) in XTS mode. Each of the cascaded ciphers uses its own key. All encryption keys are mutually independent (note that header keys are independent too, even though they are derived from a single password ? see the section Header Key Derivation, Salt, and Iteration Count). See above for information on the individual cascaded ciphers.

A potentially discomforting point in how Truecrypt does this, is that they state, that the different cascaded header keys are derived from a single password.
It may well be that, as Robert intuitively felt, an avenue of attack on the password and subsequently derived keys, might be far more feasible than trying to brute force a keyspace, and therefore rendering the resulting ciphertext more vulnerable than if it were encrypted only once.

I think it should be quite doable, by those fluent in rfc 2440, 4880,  but I cannot impose upon them if they do not have time to do so.
I will try it myself and see how it goes.
This Is how I thought about doing it.  If anyone has advice about it, I am thankful in advance, but please do not use up your time in asking me for what, and telling me why it can absolutely never work..
I have access to a Professor who is an authority on RSA, and once I have everything done and ready, I can ask him if it would be secure/advisable to proceed,
but cannot take advantage of him by asking more than once.
For simplicity, I would start with a V3 RSA key, .(V4 keys have ability to add subkeys, and the ability to have a master key do either signing only, or both signing or encrypting. I'm not sure, but think  that because of this, it may add other material that obscures extracting only the RSA part of the key.  Once I can get it to work with a v3 key, will try to extract part by part from the V4 key).
So, here's the tentative plan:
[1] Generate a v3 test key in pgp 2.x
[2] Import it to GnuPG
[3] Remove the passphrase
[4] Export it as a .asc file
[5] Examine it in PGPdump,  and extract the RSA components
[6] Try it out in an RSA program offline.
(Obviously, for a real secret key, would not use the online PGPdump)
Any help or criticism about how to extract a functional RSA key would be appreciated.

@_subject: hash email addresses / directory privacy enhancement 
I don't know how much of a spam problem there is by having keyservers harvested for their e-mail addresses,
but if indeed it does become a problem, then maybe at that point, the e-mail addresses should not be listed on the keyserver.
When a person generates a new key, the e-mail required  by gnupg for key generation, can be listed as something benign such as
name at my.keys
The key will still be identified by the fingerprint, and the e-mail address can be given out by the owner to whomever she/he wants to give it to.
Many keys no longer have the original e-mail address as when they were generated, so the question becomes;
"If the key is accessible by the fingerprint and key name, and people consider the fingerprint the most trustable identifier of the key,
and an attacker cannot forge a key with the same fingerprint, then why is it necessary to have the e-mail address on the keyserver at all?

As a pgp 2 user, I agree with all the above, and taking whatever steps are felt to be easier to maintain and move GnuPG forward.
Those who insist on using pgp2.x for whatever things (actually very very few) they feel cannot be accomplished with GnuPG, will do so anyway.
I ask only, that acceptance of V3 keys be maintained, as many of us have used our V3 keys in GnuPG, (with SHA 2 and 64 bit algorithms),
Otherwise, all our encrypted messages will not be able to be decrypted in later versions of GnuPG, and if the encrypted messages were signed, they would no longer be able to be verified,
(as even Disastry's version, while able to decrypt everything except Camellia, cannot verify a V4 key signature).

I often switch between Ubuntu and Windows, and have 2 separate gpg.conf. files,

while in Ubuntu it mounts as a numbered directory as part of a dev/ directory,
so the home directory for gnupg has a different address).
Anyway, when using a gpg.conf file in windows that was done in Ubuntu,
Windows sometimes 'decides' that the lines are too long and wrap them, thereby creating a new line in gpg.conf that makes no sense.
This can happen if the 'Comment' option  line is too long, or a # commented out line is too long.
Another reason that might invalidate a gpg.conf, on windows,  is if there are any '/' instead of '\'  .
The actual program in Linux that is used to write the gpg.conf doesn't really matter.
Using Notepad to edit it in windows will quickly show if there is a problem.
Notepad is in every edition of windows, and opens files without .txt  extensions.

It is possible to encrypt and sign as one step, and then armor the signature and attach it to the decrypted plaintext to make it look like it was first clearsigned, or armored signed, and then encrypted.
The problem with doing it the way you want, is that while it is possible to remove the signature and save it as a detached signature,
it is not (afaik) possible to bind that detached signature to the plaintext and have it encrypted as one process. I would need to be zipped together or otherwise connected first.

In the pgp 2.6 config.txt file there are only two options for compression:

Tried looking through the documentation  'which' compression 2.x uses, but couldn't find the specific one. but did find that there was a problem with 'decompression' in 2.4 which was changed to 2.6

@_subject: symmetric email encryption 
I think what Hauke meant was an exchange of the *passphrase* for the symmetric encryption, not the session key.
The symmetric keys would always change with each new email message, using gnupg symmetric encryption.
The only annoyance with this type of approach, is that it needs a separate passphrase for each correspondent,
(which we don't bother with ordinarily, since encrypting the symmetric session key to a correspondent's public key makes it unnecessary).
Hushmail has a one-way variant of this approach. A Hushmail user can send an encrypted message to someone who does not have encryption or Hushmail, by having the Hushmail user give the recipient an answer to a question.
The email message is encrypted symmetrically using that answer as a passphrase.
(Hushmail makes it intentionally easier, (albeit less secure),  by making the 'answer' case insensitive, and ignoring spaces and punctuation characters).
The receiver gets a message that an encrypted e-mail has been sent, and is directed to the Hushmail server where the sender's question is asked, and the receiver has 3 chances to provide the correct answer.  A correct answer decrypts the symmetrically encrypted e-mail and the plaintext is displayed on the Hushmail server. The e-mail is removed from the server after 72 hours.
A few people who have received this type of message from me, thought it was interesting and convenient, and signed up for their own hushmail accounts, and are now well on their way to learning gnupg,
so it might be an approach to get people who have never used encryption, to try it.
(My apologies, Hauke,  in advance if I mis-understood you and this discussion).

Happened to notice a minor incompatibility that was not there in
previous versions of gnupg 1.x, before IDEA was included.
Created the following symmetrically encrypted message using Disastry's

This was the command, using Twofish as the preferred cipher:
V:zdm6dj32>pgp -ca -jt c:hct.txt
TWOFISH chosen for conventional encryption.

International version - for use everywhere (including USA).
Current time: 2014/03/12 13:42 GMT
PGP is now using TWOFISH with MD5.
You need a pass phrase to encrypt the file.
Enter pass phrase: sss
Output file 'c:hct.asc' already exists.  Overwrite (y/N)? y
Now, when trying to decrypt, this is what happens in GnuPG 1.4.16 :

Is there something in the way that pgp 2.x makes symmetrical messages,
that gnupg recognizes as 2.x, and therefore assumes IDEA ?

@_subject: Multiple Subkey Pairs 
It is difficult to do what you want using subkeys,
but you can easily accomplish what you want by making three new keypairs:
Keypair 1  will have the Master signing key and the encryption subkey, with the comment " Principal Keypair"  (or whatever descriptive comment you think is clear to your e-mail correspondence.
Keypair 2 will have a signing key and encrypting subkey, with the comment "normal computer', and signed by your Master key.
Keypair 3 will have a signing key and encrypting subkey with the comment "mobile device', and signed by your Master key.
All 3 keypairs will have the same name and e-mail address. Keypairs 2  and 3 can have whatever shorter expiration you want.
You can let all your correspondents know that they can encrypt simultaneously to all 3 of your keys that have the same e-mail address (assuming that you give them the fingerprints and long key id' s for the 3 keys, and they aren't going to be fooled by some attacker making a new key with your name and  e-mail address).
This way you can read and correspond on whatever device you are using at the time.

@_subject: GnuPG encryption with key file 
Even Truecrypt, which does use keyfiles, doesn't do it this way.
Truecrypt uses only the first 1mb of a keyfile, no matter how large the file is,
and uses it to perform a cryptographic function on the passphrase, with that result
then being used to to produce a header key for the encrypted volume.
The suggestions on how to use a keyfile for gnupg, are just using the file as the passphrase.
It doesn't really add to the complexity against an attack, and may make it more vulnerable to an attack as pointed out above.
If you want a simple way to generate a passphrase of maximum complexity for GnuPG,
there is a very easy way to do it;
[1] Encrypt a file to one of your private keys.
[2] Decrypt the file using the option of '--show-session-key'
[3] Use the 64 character session key as the passphrase for whatever you want to symmetrically encrypt with GnuPG.
[4] Sore the encrypted file in [1] in a safe place.
It is as difficult to brute force passphrase as it would be to brute force the GnuPG encrypted message session key itself.
Much as I like different crypto options, I don't think it would really improve GnuPG to have a keyfile option.

The attacker wouldn't need to.
The attacker ALREADY has your secret key and can decrypt any messages you have, or ever will have with that key,
But in answer to your question,
The attacker cannot determine your passphrase based on that information.
The knowledge of the key without the passphrase protection, is the equivalent of knowing the 'plaintext' of something that will be encrypted symmetrically with a gnupg block cipher, which, if, the attacker had a copy of the secret key with the new encryption, the attacker could just try a passphrase-guessing algorithm on the key with the passphrase.
Knowing the un-encrypted copy of the key would not help any.
(I don't know how to explain the workings of the block-ciphers in gnupg, but think that they are resistant to known-plaintext attacks.)

@_subject: How much information can be gleaned about a gpg key by possessing 
GnuPG works by using hybrid encryption:
[1] The plaintext is converted to ciphertext using a block cipher, with GnuPG generating a random session key for the encryption
[2] The random session key is then encrypted to the recipient's public key.
[3] The recipient uses the private key to recover the session key in [2], which is then used to decrypt the plaintext in [1].
No amount of plaintext and ciphertext reveal anything about the recipient's *Private* key. (The recipient's public key is usually *public* and known already).
That said, Any attacker can simultaneously encrypt to a 'Target' public key, and to the Attacker's own public key.
The Attacker can then recover the session key by decrypting with the Attacker's private key.
This 'session key' is the only thing that can be used as the "plaintext" that is encrypted to the Target's public key.
An attacker now knows:
(a) The *ciphertext*, which is the session key encrypted to the Target's public key.
(b) *PART* of the *plaintext*, which is the session key, since it was encrypted to the attacker's public key.
(It is only *part* because the session key is padded with a *different* padding for each key to which it is encrypted,
even when the same session key is simultaneous encrypted to different public keys.)
(c) The Target's Public key.
The Attacker can generate an unlimited amount of messages in this way.
Using this information the attacker now wants to find/reconstruct the Target's Private key.
I don't know that much about attacking RSA  Key Pairs in trying to find the Private Key, (other than factoring the modulus),
but suffice it to say, that in the over 20 years that RSA has been around and many different attacks have been tried,
*this* type of attack has not seemed feasible enough for anyone to try.
Short summary,
No useful information can be gleaned.

@_subject: encrypting to expired certificates 
GnuPG tries to be very accommodating to almost all types of users, and has succeeded admirably in this case.
I always wondered why anyone would ever really 'need' an expiration date, and how they would know in advance that they would need it to expire in the exact time they listed when the key was generated.
A simple way to work around it, is to designate another one of the person's most trusted keys, as the 'revoker' key, or to generate a revocation certificate right after the key was made, and that way, if there is any future reason to not want people to encrypt to that key, to just revoke it then.
But, if for whatever reason, one didn't do so, and lost the key or forgot the passphrase, and wanted the key to eventually 'pass on', then one could insure for its painless expiration,  by making a timely expiration date ...
Now, suppose someone got into the habit of routinely making an 'expiration' date, but still has the the secret key and passphrase, and didn't yet generate a newer encryption key, then it's nice for him to know that GnuPG allows for the possibility for people to still encrypt to that key, until he makes other arrangements, and that GnuPG is prudently set up so that it 'shouldn't be 'too easy' to do, so that one will think twice it one 'really' needs to do it.

Which is especially reasonable,
since it seems that the option of '--faked-system-time' (which used to work on earlier versions of GnuPG 2.x),
but doesn't work on current versions of 2.x, and never worked on 1.x, now make it especially cumbersome to encrypt to an expired key, (by requiring changing the system clock and changing it back again).
As the '--faked-system-time' option is interesting,  maybe re-implementing it in both 2.x and 1.x might be an easy workaround in those cases where a user has forgotten to update an expired key.
With regard to the resulting sign and encrypt problem, a simple workaround would be to clearsign first, and the encrypt the clearsigned mesage with the  '--faked-system-time' option .

@_subject: protecting pub-keys from unwanted signatures 
It would be very helpful if such a protection against unwanted key signatures could be instituted.
Here is a possible suggestion on how it might be done:
[1] Have GnuPG require a 'cross-certification' of signatures, similar to the cross-certification of subkeys.
[2] Have GnuPG give a message upon importing a public key, that
"Signatures from keyid's [...], [....], and [...] have not been cross-certified by their owner,
Clean these signatures, y / n ? "
(Alternatively, the default could be:
"These signatures will be removed. If you want to keep them, enter  'keep-sig' ",
and then each new sig would be displayed, and if the importer
wants the sig, the importer would need to enter 'keep-sig' for each sig individually.)
This would require the owners of the keys to do periodic checking of their keys and cross-certify the signatures they want.
It would also be a bit of work for the owners to cross-certify all the 'good'  signatures they were happy to get.
Just a suggestion.
The implementers can best decide how much extra work this would require, and if there is a simpler better way to accomplish the desired result.

@_subject: How to detect extraneous content in clearsigned (--clearsign) 
There is a way of addition to clearsigned messages that is not detectable:
Adding 'spaces' at the end of the line of visible characters.
Here is a clearsigned message without any spaces added:
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256
It is possible to add blank spaces to the end of the visible characters on each line, as long as it doesn't result in a new line wrap,
and the signature will still verify.
Don't know of any practical exploits of this property, other than possibly intentionally padding the files to use up someone's storage, (not likely in today's large storage capacity ;-)   )
It could be useful if  a sender and receiver would agree on a special code as to the padding,
i.e. if someone is being forced to sign something, the sender and receiver could agree
that adding the following spaces to each line for 4 lines:  4 would signify the hidden message:
signing my (but this could also easily be forged by anyone who knew the system ...)
Anyway, just a curiosity of which users should be aware.
Absolutely *no* suggestions/requests to change GnuPG in any way
(which wouldn't be backward compatible anyway)
Armored signing, or a detached signature of a text file,  *will*  detect any spaces added on to a line.

There could be a workaround, where the key is uploaded to the keyservers,
but functionally unusable except to individuals whom the key-creator wants to use it:
[1] Encrypt part of the public key symmetrically, the same way that the private key is symmetrically encrypted.
[2] Send the passphrase to whomever you want to send the public key, encrypted to their public key.
[3] Upload the key to keyservers.  It will be usable only by those whom you choose to give the passphrase.
(* Unless*  you misjudged someone to whom you sent the passphrase, and he turns maliciously on you, and uploads the decrypted form .... )

The only possible reasons I can think of are:
[1] Remailer use,  Original remailers used PGP 2.x and even though some use GnuPG, others are reluctant to change anything.
[2] Large File Transfers
PGP 2.x can be used as a uuencode, and automatically split a signed and encrypted armored file into 100 smaller files ready to be emailed and reconstitued by the receiver.
The default for file splitting, is 720 armored lines, but have done it for much more, and successfully sent a 1 gb Truecrypt container and reconstituted it.
If you are thinking of looking at PGP 2.x, I would recommend Disastry's version, as it is not limited to MD5 and IDA but can use any HASH and any encryption algorithm except for Camelia.
If anyone knows how to install this on 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04 please let me know.
It wouldn't compile on Ubuntu 12.x, but was able to install the linux executable PGP on a 32 bit system, but can't on 14.x  64 bit.)

If you don't want to keep your passsphrase, and want only to keep the session key,
and you want this to have no weakness because of a questionably strong enough password that was used to generate the key,
then there is an easy way to do what you want:
[1] Encrypt a test message to any of your own keys.
[2] Decrypt this test message, with the option of --show-session-key
[3] Use this session key as the 64 character password for your symmetric encryption, (and save it, or you won't be able to decrypt the symmetric message).
[4] Decrypt your symmetrically encrypted file or message, using the option of --show-session-key
[5] Save this session key, and if you wish, you can destroy the first one. (you can always get it back by decrypting your message of step [1] ).
The string-to-key part of generating the session key for the symmetrically encrypted message, will be using a random 64 character GnuPG generated session key as it's password.
You can't find a better password (especially even one that you don't have to remember ;-)   )

@_subject: Lower Bound for Primes during GnuPG key generation 
Approximately what interval is meant by 'primes of the same size' ?
i.e. for a 4096 RSA key the interval would be  [ 2^(2048 + k) - 2^(2048 - k) ]
What would the range of k be?
Any interval of primes can be approximated by:
n(U)[log(n(U))] - n(L)[log(n(L))]
where U is the uppermost prime, and L is the lowermost prime
   (The Prime Number Theorem, Consequence Two: The nth prime is about n log n )
So, to give a trivial example,  If the interval of primes chosen is from  2^2047 to 2^2049, then this interval is only
log(2) [ 2049^2 - 2047^2]  = 5678      which is a fairly small number of primes to check, for this type of attack to find the GnuPG keypair.
does GnuPG automatically reject twin primes ( p, p+2) ,  and Sophie-Germain primes (p, 2p+1) ?

2^2049 [ 2049 log 2 ]  -  2^2047 [2047 log 2] which is an infeasibly large interval to attack this way.

While writing in the "TOFU for GnuPG" thread it occurred to me that
GnuPG does not look at whether we "trust" the other keys to which an
incoming message was encrypted.
Wouldn't it be reasonable to also look at whether we "trust" other
keys that are seen to be a party to the conversation?
GnuPG already does.
It will ask for each key that you want to encrypt to, if you haven't
trusted it, and ask if you really want to do this.
Assuming that you trusted the person who sent it to you, then it's
reasonable "for that person' to encrypt to other keys that that person
You should encrypt only to keys you trust, and if they trust someone
else's keys they can encrypt your reply to them.
This will defeat an interesting man in the middle attack:
Suppose Alice wants to encrypt to Bob, and Eve, and Rumplestiltsken,
and sends a signed and encrypted message to Bob showing that it was
also encrypted to Rumplestiltsken, whom Bob does not know.
Mallory can intercept this mail, remove the ESK packet for
Rumplestiltsken, make his own fake Rumplestiltsken key, and encrypt
'any' session key to it, and then add the ESK packet, and make a new
checksum and replace it, and send on the message.
Since you are not able to encrypt either the real or the fake
Rumplestiltsken key, you have no way of knowing if the session key is
genuine or not in that packet.
Now if you routinely encrypt to all the keys when you reply, then
Mallory can decrypt the message.
A prudent workaround when encrypting to multiple keys, is to mention
in the signed plaintext which keys and fingerprints are being
encrypted to, and then if there is some pressing reason to multiple encrypt, then
the receiver who trusts the sender's *trust* of the other keys, can go
ahead and multliple encrypt the reply.

Hushmail has a marketing pitch to Medical Personnel about compliance

The receiver gets a message that an encrypted e-mail has been sent,
and a link to a site where it is stored for only 72 hours. Upon
following the link, the receiver types in an answer to a pre-arranged
question between the doctor and the patient, and sees the plaintext,

if all are wrong, the message is removed from the site.
So it's pretty simple to use,  (simple enough that busy doctors are
not interested in learning GnuPG  :-(((((      )
The doctor calls the patient, and arranges the question and answer,
and then can send files encrypted as attachments.
An MITM attack is not practical as the doctor and patient share the
secret over a different channel  (phone, person to person in the
office, etc.)
It is, however, very vulnerable to a DNS attack.  The MITM can simply
access the site, enter the wrong answer 3 times, and the message is

So it seems reasonable, that the symmetric algorithm the user picked to protect the private key,  (--s2k-algo ciphername),
is the symmetric algorithm that the user would prefer for symmetric encryption, as long as the receiver can decrypt it.
In practice, (standard, not hacked, non-customized ) GnupG, can decrypt ANY of the symmetric algorithms any GnuPG user can use.
Since the original user, the sender, is encrypting the message, it is again reasonable that the sender be able to choose the algorithm with which the sender feels most comfortable.

Use the session key from a message encrypted only to your secret key, as the passphrase for the additionally symmetrically encrypted message.

[2] Sender 1 and Receiver 1 now send conventionally encrypted messages

One can generate a keypair with a random name, and send it to the

Today was announced that
SHA1 is now completely broken
A few weeks back it was mentioned that there is a new proposal for a
openpgp standart including a new algorithm for pgp fingerprints.
As this is currently not applicable in practice, I would like to know
what this new development means for pgp-gnupg and the use of SHA1 for
key identification.
After researching how the fingerprint is generated, I think it would
be easy to include a new option in gnupg to print a fingerprint using
sha256. Would that be something that will/can be included in future
versions of gnupg
The Openpgp standards group is working on this.
The link you give for the collision used 2 PDF's.
Using a PDF is sort-of 'cheating', and does not extrapolate to being
'completely broken'.
Assuming that it is possible to find a pre-image collision, i.e:
[1] m1.txt 1 has an SHA1 hash of H1
[2] m2.txt will now have the same SHA1 hash H1
What will happen to in order to generate m2.txt  is that there will be
many trials of a gibberrish string added to the plaintext of m2.txt
until one is found that has the same SHA1 hash as m1.txt
This will be quite visible in the plaintext of m2.txt, and won't fool
With a PDF, the 'extra gibberish string' is 'hidden'. It is not in the
actual PDF the receiver reads, only in the meta-data, the appended PDF
While this is *do-able* and a good reason to move on to a future
SHA256 hash, it would not be transferable (at this time, based on the
PDF collision data), to find a fingerprint collision for any v4 key.

@_subject: SHA1 collision found 
Not sure about you but I am not able to see the difference between a
valid pgp key and "gibberish" ;)
In the example of the 2 pdf's,  they started with one pdf, made
another pdf, then multiple (more than billions) trials of adding a
string to the second pdf so that it hashes to the first.
With regard to generating a new key that hashes to a known specific
key, the forger must do 2 things simultaneously;
[1] generating new key material
[2] seeing that the hashed fingerprint of the new key matches that of
the first key
The forger does not start with a newly generated key and add material
so that the hash would match the first key (the case of the pdf's).
If that were the case, then the key system would be broken now for the
SHA1 hash.
Even for v3 keys, which were not SHA1 hashed, the only way to generate
a new key with the same fingerprint, would be to allow the key size to
vary (usually to a bizarre key size that would be quite suspect, and
not believed).
Now, for a V4 key with an SHA1 hash, and a further restriction that
the forged key size be the same as the first key, this is not known to
be doable day, even with the google cloud computer sharing efforts,
and the breakthrough of finding pdf's with the same hash.
Again, I fully support moving to a secure hash, but I do think that
users have more than enough time until the open-pgp group issues the
official standard.

It was probably not the correct passphrase.
The error that gpg2 gives when entering the wrong passphrase for a symmetrically encrypted message is exactly:  gpg: decryption failed: Bad session key
This is the same whether you are off for even 1 character of the passphrase, or even if you just press 'enter' without a passphrase at all.
Here is a sample symmetrically encrypted message:
First enter the correct passphrase,  sss
gpg (V1 and V2)  decrypts it as is should be.
now enter just ss or anything except the correct passphrase, or just press enter, and you get:
gpg: decryption failed: bad key   (when using Version 1.4.x)
gpg: decryption failed: Bad session key  (when using Version 2.x)
(Something to do with the string-to-key formation.
When the passphrase is off, the 'key' generated from it, is wrong, and when that wrong 'key' is used to attempt decryption, gpg rightfully gives an error message that the 'key' is bad.

I am all in favor of this and even considered to that some time ago.
However, not too long ago we removed support for PGP-2 keys which
unfortunately resulted in lots of angry mails from people who now think
they need to use gnupg 1.4 every day because they seem to read mails
quite vocal.  Now telling them they need to enable an option to read
certain not that old mail (e.g. creating by other OpenPGP
implementations) will a) lead to even more angry mails and b) they will
keep on using that option for all mails.  Thus my tentative plan was to
make the next major version hard fail on messages without MDC and slowly
start using our forthcoming AEAD encryption mode.
Well okay, with the new support of the Ehtmlfail paper we could now
point to that paper and always hard error out if no MDC is used even for
old algorithms.  Shall we consider this?
As an Old PGP 2.x user, I can say that the majority of PGP 2.x users communicating among them selves, DON'T use GnuPG at all. Those who do use GnuPG, have a new V4 key and use exclusively that, and can easily handle the hardwired MDC fail, and will even be thankful for the GnuPG 'protection'.

Stupid question: what is wrong with a "encrypt/decrypt old
format" flag/config option? If I have the need to use old stuff, I can
turn that on. All I see here is a "do not open old stuff" as a default
setting which should solve most issues.
There would be nothing wrong with that whatsoever from the perspective of users who need to access old encrypted data (e.g. archival access purposes), which is the particular use case I have been pointing out.
However, I don't think this would satisfy those who want to ensure that users cannot encrypt new data with legacy standards. In order to prevent users from doing this (which, to be clear, is something I agree with) there needs to be some way to make it difficult or impossible
There is a simple solution that would satisfy everybody  ;-)
Keep an 'old' edition of GnuPG 1.4x for anyone who needs to decrypt 'old data', (or encrypt new data the 'old' way ...).
As one of the original die-hard pgp2.x users who still uses pgp (Disastry's 2.6.3 multi), I can comfortably say, that 2.x diehard users still use 2.x among themselves, and don't care about GnuPG.
The real issue is, that it's not easy to compile 2.x on newer systems, and people who have migrated to GnuPG on some remailer groups, still want to use their v3 keys, and need encrypting capability, which again would be solved by letting them use an 'old' version of 1.4.x, and as long as these versions are still being archived (which is reasonable for the forseeable future), they should have no problems.

GnuPG does not recognize the empty whitespace, and reads the version line as continuous with the keyblock, and it won't import.

Exactly the same way.
Android phones (software) are made by Google.
Google archives data from every source connecting to one of its applications, Chrome, search engine, gmail, etc.
I don't trust them, and have no way of verifying any claim of what they do, or do not, store.
Also, if you have any app that required 'rooting' of your phone, then even Google doesn't trust it, and expressly says that it will not guarantee false (malicious) expenditures by Google Wallet. So the 'rooted' app probably does have access to your android gnupg data.
Annoying, I know,  to not use gnupg on android, but prudently safe.
fwiw,  the gnupg apps work well on android, but I just don't trust the phone.

=====[ end quoted material ]=====
Can this really be done?
(Does not matter so much to me personally, as I grew up with v3 keys, and even when using a V4 key, I don't generate a subkey, but allow all the functions (sign, encrypt. certify) to be done with the master key).
Does matter a lot if I can't trust the subkey of someone whom I want to encrypt to.
How real is this threat, and is it any threat at all, if simply binding the subkey to a different master key, won't allow for anyone else other than the 'real' owner, to decrypt messages encrypted to that subkey?

GnuPG has been requiring cross-certification for a very long time, which would mean that an attacker who attaches a person's listed subkey to a different masterkey, would still not be able to do anything with it, because the attacker can't make it cross-certify.
Being simplistically naive here,
How difficult would it be to get keyservers to agree that only the key owners can submit new signatures to their own keys?
(i.e., The owner's detached signature of the public keyblock having the new signature, required together with any submitted key with a new signature.) A Denial-of Service attack will still always be possible against a keyserver, since it is easy for an attacker to generate a large volume of legitimate keys, with only a self-signature, and upload them to the keyserver,
but at least then, no individual key by a real user, could be attacked.

 you have 3 tedious options, 1 more tedious than the other  8^)   :
[1]  use default-recipient-self, and explain in an n.b. in your
plaintext that you want to have a record of what you sent, but don't
want to leave it in plaintext,  and you will have an encrypted copy in
your sent box openable by you  (this is very common).
[2] encrypt only to the sender, but also encrypt the plaintext only to
you, and store the encrypted file in your sent or other convenient
folder, with the date and the recipient.
[3] only for the overly paranoid who revel in tedious work-arounds 8^)     :
(a)  Encrypt to both yourself and the recipient
(b)  Remove your own id packet from the ciphertext, (c)  Re-calculate  the crc of the ciphertext
(d)  Send the 'hacked' ciphertext along to the original recipient
(e)  Store the first ciphertext from (a) along with the one from (d),
in your sent folder
(f)   now you will always be able to decrypt and retrieve the original
I don't recommend this, but it is *possible* to add a (not yet done, but not terribly
complicated either) patch to gnupg to 'display' the session key in the
terminal window, (while you are encrypting only to one recipient),
and then you can encrypt that session key to your key, and store it,
a (also not yet done, but not terribly complicated either) patch,
 to allow gnupg to use a session key supplied by the user as an entry
in the command line(i.e.  --use-session-key  (64 character string from
step (a) above)
That session key is as random as any done by gnupg, and isn't really
being 're-used', it's just being stored in the encrypted file from step (a) and is
being sent with the same message encrypted to the same recipient as in
step (a)

about 'who else knows' what is encrypted in your encrypted e-mail that
was encrypted only to you, it 'can' be done,

Would the ciphertext at (d) be much different than encrypting to the
recipient and hidden-encrypt-to your own key?
The ciphertext in (d) would have no indication that it was being
encrypted to anyone else.
Using 'hidden-encrypt' to your own key, would show that it was
encrypted to another key, but undetectable to whom.
As a concrete difference, if you used the command:   gpg
--try-all-secrets  on the file encrypted to the recipient and hidden-encrypt-to your own
it would decrypt to your own key.
Even from the ciphertext, it is detectable because it is 'longer'
(i.e., has another key-packet).
Try encrypting to only one recipient, and the encrypting the same
plaintext to the same recipient, while also using hidden-encrypt to,
and look at the difference in length.

If you know from people who actually used them, of other brands on Amazon that are trustworthy, maybe you can get a good card for less.

@_subject: Traveling without a secret key 
There is an alternative travel approach that works for me:
[1] No real keyring on my laptop, (just a dummy one to be able to use GnuPG 2.x on the laptop)
[2] Bootable 1 tb usb,(same size as ordinary usb drive), which has bootable ubuntu OS on it, with the keyrings in a Veracrypt container after Ubuntu loads.
(Ubuntu allows for the entire bootable drive to be encrypted, doesn't need yubi, or other programs. It can make the usb drive bootable using ubuntu OS installation options).
Laptop can be used for everything not requiring a secret key.
In event that a secret key needs to be used, (decrypt, sign, authenticate, etc), the laptop can be booted from the usb drive.
Also, have a backup of the keyring in a Veracrypt container that easily fits on an microSD card on any android phone with microSD slots.

@_subject: "encrypted with 1 passphrase" 
============================== START ==============================
Not exactly, but there are situations where GnuPG can simultaneously encrypt conventionally with a passphrase, and also to a Public Key
Here is an example:
This was encrypted simultaneously conventionally, and to a test key dddd1, and, (by default, also to my default key).
The command used to encrypt is:
gpg -a -c -e -r dddd1 c:\h\jadeT1.txt
this produces the encrypted file jadeT.txt.asc  (listed at the beginning).
The passphrase is sss
Here is the keypair of the public key dddd1 that the message was simultaneously encrypted to, (an RSA V4 key, but generated many years ago in GnuPG 1.x):
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1
Comment: Acts of Kindness better the World, and protect the Soul
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1
Passphrase dddd1
-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
Here is the output of GnuPG when trying to decrypt symmetrically:

So, the "encrypted with one passphrase" describes the symmetrically encrypted packet,
and then GnuPG describes the other packets encrypted to public keys, but without a passphrase.
n.b.  all the encrypted packets use the same session key.
afaik, GnupG does not allow two different simultaneously conventionally encrypted packets in the same encryption output.

@_subject: decrypt aes256 encrypted file without gpg-agent 
Also can't get it without using agent.  Tried using option of --no-use-agent  and gpg2 says 'obsolete option, has no effect'.
The option of --no-default-keyring doesn't help if the home directory is not open.
Agent will not start unless home directory is open  ( my home directory is in an encrypted container)
Once the home directory is there (when I unencrypted mine), agent starts, and a pinentry window opens asking for the symmetric passphrase, When I unencrypt the home directory, but not the keyring, gpg will still decrypt when using the option of --no-default-keyring
(feature request:  can GPG2 be made to work from only the command-line without a pine entry window, and without gpg-agent?)

@_subject: decrypt aes256 encrypted file without gpg-agent 
Try this very long workaround :
[1] Install a fake homedirectory
[2] Install a fake keyring (1 public and secret key that you never use)
Then try this command:
gpg --agent-program --no-use-agent --passphrase yourpassphrasestring --decrypt filename
This is a way of making the --no-use-agent option active.
GnuPG still needs a homedirectory and a keyring before trying to use the passphrase to decrypt
(n.b.  I have not actually tried the above, so am unsure if it is effective)
otherwise , just use GnuPG 1.4.x , and unless you ever need an elliptic key, it should do everything you want.

@_subject: Fwd: The GnuPR FAQ 
How many words were in your passphrase??
Here is some data on the Diceware list:
The Diceware list has only 7776 words.   A complete dictionary has almost 2 orders of magnitude more.
"Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged, together with its 1993 Addenda Section, includes some 470,000 entries. The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition, reports that it includes a similar number."
10 diceware words provides a greater Brute Force space, than 2^128 (a gnupg session key for older defaults of CAST-5)
(  7776^10 = 8.08x10^38        2^128 = 3.40?10^38  )
20 Diceware words  provides a greater Brute Force space, than 2^256
(  7776^20 =  6.53?10^77         2^256 =1.157?10^77  )
Even using only English words greater than 5 letters and unrelated to each other, an extremely low-bound estimate, would be 77760 words. (in reality, far greater, but let's use an example people would agree on).
So using 8 words chosen semi-randomly from a dictionary, 77760^8 = 1.336?10??, still greater than a a 2^128 Brute Force Space.
So, not only is is NOT *horrible* advice, it should be enough for anyone's threat model.
