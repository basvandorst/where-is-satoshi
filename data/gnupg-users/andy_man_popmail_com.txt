@_subject: Signing with more than one secret key available 
If I use a different keypair for each recipient, how can I have the appropriate secret key used *automatically* in order to sign the message?
Shouldn't the secret key include an (optional) email string for
"recipient" as well, not just my own address? So that the correct key
could be chosen automatically when using e.g. Enigmail/Mozilla.
Or is it simply silly to use different keypairs?

@_subject: Key sizes, public vs. secret key 
I don't know very much about this, so I'd like to learn about key sizes.
Is it correct that the public keys can never be larger than 1024b? If so, why is that?
Then I wonder, due to that fact, does it mean that if I make a secret key that has e.g. 8192b size, that the messages are no stronger protected than if I had used 1024b secret key?
Cheers, Andy

@_subject: double encryption 
I have a simple question.
If I encrypt a file using a certain public key, and then encrypts the already encrypted file using a different public key, does it mean that the encryption grade increaes to (n^2)?
Of course, it's presumed that the recipient has access to both relevant secret keys.
Cheers, Andy

@_subject: Can gpg be used for INLINE signing of multimedia? 
Is it possible to use gpg signing as a parasite to image or audio files, in
order to guarantee autenthicity of the content?
Is there such software solutions already?
I've heard of other 'digital signing' methods for images, but as far as I understand,
those methods modify the image content, albeit only slightly. Am I correct?
