@_subject: changing the passwd 
Dear all
I like to use gpg for a project to handle user accounts on a web application. So I need a way a user could change his pasphrase by a dialogue over ssl of a I tried a while and found out yes it could be changed but it is not changed to the passphrase I want.
Please could you give me a hint what I am doing wrong.
The syntax I uses:
echo "old" | gpg --command-fd 0 --yes --textmode --no-tty --edit-key mykey passwd newpass save
If I do this on a text terminal the passphrase is changed but it is not best regards
