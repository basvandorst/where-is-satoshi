@_subject: using gpg with private keys from openssl certificates? 
Dear Mr. Arghman
from here
it looks like an x.509  PKCS12  Public key Cryptography Standard file
can be used to sign your PGP key.
Can I sign my PGP key with a Thawte Freemail certificate?
Indeed you can. Although Thawte withdrew official and integrated support
for signing PGP keys some time ago, there are still ways to achieve this
(Thawte are looking into ways to reinstigate the process, but this may
be some time away). Note that this process will only work for RSA keys,
either legacy or 'new' RSA. 'New' RSA keys are only supported in the
very latest versions of PGP.
The steps you need to take are as follows (many thanks to Martin Bene
for this description, which I have amended slightly for clarity):
    There are two conversion steps required:
    1) Generate a certificate request from the existing key.
    2) Get the certificate chain returned by Thawte into a format PGP
can import.
    Generate Cert Request
    Use PGP's built-in CA support to generate the certificate request
and a script on a webserver to mail it back to you. You can either use
the script I've put up on my server or use your own server, mailreq
script attached.
    [Contact me if you want a copy of this script -- Peter]
       1. In PGPKeys got to Options/CA
       2. Enter  at fugue.org as
the CA URL
       3. Select "Net tools PKI Server&quote as the server type
       4. To get your certificate, go to the Thawte certificate manager
       5. Use "Paste-in CSR Certificate Enrollment" right at the bottom
       6. Click through to the "Paste PKCS10 Certificate Here" page
       7. Note the required common name, something like "dFA7F1w4vmxLxA93"
       8. Copy this common name to the clipboard (don't close the browser!)
       9. In PGPKeys, right-click your key and select 'Add/Certificate
      10. Edit the "Full Name" field, and paste in the string you copied
from the Thawte site
      11. Submit by clicking OK
      12. You should now get an email containing your request
      13. Back in the Web browser, paste the request into the text field
      14. Submit the Certificate request.
    Import the stuff you get back from thawte
    Thawte will return the finished certificate both as a Netscape
Certificate chain and as a PKCS7 Certificate chain, neither of which PGP
understands. So, some conversion is required - the easiest way is to
split the PKCS7 chain into seperate certificates and output these in
ASCII format - just save into seperate .pem files and import into PGP
(using 'Key/Import' and selecting the .pem files).
    To split the PKCS7 chaing, either use the attached splitchain.c script
    [Contact me if you want a copy of this script -- Peter]
    (requires Peter Gutmanns Cryptlib library) or use the web interface
at     You'll want to verify (trust) the Thawte Root Certificate you just
imported to your PGP Keyring - here are some ways to do that:
        * Download the "Personal Freemail Root" cert from Thawte
directly, and compare Key Fingerprint/Key ID. To do this:
             1. Go to              2. Find the Root entitled "1.Thawte Personal Freemail CA,
1995.12.31 - 2020.12.31" (this should be the right one)
             3. Download the root in text form, saving as a .pem file
             4. Import the .pem file into PGP
        * Export the Freemail Root certificate the Internet Explorer
Root CA database, on your computer, and compare Key ID/Fingerprint. To
do this:
             1. Open Internet Explorer, and select 'Tools/Internet
             2. In the 'Trusted Root Certificates section, marvel first
of all at how many organisations you trust completely (!), and then
select 'Thawte Personal Freemail CA'
             3. Click 'Export...'
             4. Either: export as a PKCS7 chain and then split it as
described above
                Or: export as Base-64 encoded X.509
             5. Import the resulting file into PGP
    Whichever you choose, you should finish by updating signatures from
your favourite PGP Keyserver, and check those.
    Some final thoughts on the security of this process, especially with
regard to using scripts on an untrusted server (i.e. my scripts): none
of the steps involved send any Private Key data over the Internet, so
your Private Key can not be compromised.
    Consequence of a hostile script in step 1 (mailing the certificate
request back to you): the certificate request is self-signed, a modified
request would therefore no longer be valid. A completely new request
(different Private Key) would not match your key on import. The script
could get your public key, but as the name implies... I don't see any
really bad possibilities here.
    Consequence of a hostile script in step 2 (splitting the returned
Certificate chain): more room for fun here. I could return a completely
bogus certificate with equaly bogus Thawte Root certificates, thereby
getting you to trust my "fake Thawte" certificates.
    So, it's absolutely VITAL that you check the validity of the root
cert before trusting it! Once the root cert is OK, the rest of the chain
including your personal cert can be trivially checked.
Since putting the above description in this FAQ, I have received some
further advice from Steve Davies. Note that I have not yet verified any
of the details here, but it seems to be a slightly simpler approach:
    Some additional notes for you that might help make it easier in future:
    a) Setting up PGP to generate a cert request.
    You must have chosen a root certificate in the PGP Options/CA dialog
before you can request a certificate. I suggest using the export Thawte
root CA from IE, import into PGP path. Note to user that the file must
be named *.pem for PGP to install it.
    b) For generating the cert request.
    You do not need the step 1) webserver->email process to collect the
certificate request. There is a radio button on PGP's CSR generation
page that says "PKCS-10"; This copies the request straight to your
clipboard, ready to be pasted into Thawte's web-page.
    c) Using the certificate splitter
    Additional advice for using the on-line certificate splitter. Only
copy the final certificate from the resultant web-page, and not any of
the signing certificates. This is one less thing that can be faked;
Instead, import an already generated Thawte Freemail cert from IE into
PGP, with the full private key and certificate chain attached, and
delete that provate key from PGP straight away, leaving just a (trusted)
copy of the certificate chain in PGP.
    d) The poor man's (easy) solution
    Simply generate a key for IE, export it to PGP, and use that as your
PGP key (1024-bit RSA legacy only though)
    Cheers,
    Steve

I haven't tried splitchain.c but it is easy to do base64 encoding with
openssl.  I think thawte did previously offer OpenPGP certificates, but
x.509 is better suited for websites  and OpenPGP is better for emails.
thawte certificates can be used with cacert certificates. But not all
applications and operating systems support it,
but they are equal x.509 conformant.
signing and importing a key to your keyring is not equal,
here is thawte  maybe you can ask them directly?
if you google for openpgp  thawte.com
you will find
which does this
Bridging the OpenPGP, Thawte and CA Cert webs of trust.
Sometimes in one single email you can S & E with x.509
and even overload this
sign & encryption with an additional openpgp  S & E
If both secret keys were equal I would guess that
the result could be plaintext,
that x oring a message twice with the "same" key renders plaintext.
hence I feel safe when I know that my RSA key from x.509
is created totally different than the
openpgp --genkey
You will need both ways to encode.
In future we will have more voip  and that is still unencrypted,
but will be encrypted,   just like skype  GSM, SRTP  ZRTP
are different protocols which no one wants to use on a webserver.
If you send html mail s/mine  x.509 is better,
Since I mostly send ascii or unicode email
openpgp is better suited for me.
It can encrypt large files and does the trick very well
for verifying the integrity of fedora rpms.
here is what you will need.

@_subject: There is no limit on the length of a passphrase, 
Hash: SHA1
Dear List readers!
GnuPG needs a pass phrase to protect the primary and
subordinate private keys that you keep in your possession.
You need a Pass phrase to protect your private key.
Enter passphrase:
There is no limit on the length of a passphrase,
is this true?
any file system always has a maximum file size.
even ZFS has that. a Zetabyte cannot easily be neglected.
The total sum of all elementary particles in the entire universe
(open or closed) also is estimated to have an upper limit.
This is astronomical units, but they are limited.
How many elementary particles in the universe?
Our observable universe is approximately 30 Gigaparsecs across
(or 95 billion light years).
Using the equation for the volume of a sphere we can convert this into
cubic centimeters, and get ~5x10^86 cc.
Multiplying by the 500 particles per cc we found above (100 neutrinos
and 400 photons) we finally get:
2.5 x 10^89 elementary particles in the visible universe.
So I feel safe if my pass phrase is approx one Gigaparsecond in size.
Which exceeds the size of my monitor.
==> But this is not practical. not even in Sci Fiction.
as an example for a nice 'n' cool trendy UTF-8 pass phrase
Since nothing is typed, a keylogger can have problems.
Will the security increase linear with the length of a passphrase?
Can I even use anothers public key as ctrl+v or paste from clipboard for
the passphrase? More than 255 chars?
since this is the weak point how long can it in theory and practise
really be?
UTF-8, UTF-16  included?
I remember it was a discussion about it on the gnupg list.
but I didn't notice or remember or recall the reply.
What to do if the pass phrase needs to be stronger than what can be
practically typed?
save the passphrase in a file and decrypt from command line with the
gpg  --decrypt  command
displays as this
bash-3.00$ ls -l  unicode_test_01.txt
- -rw-r--r--   1 morten   other         91 Oct 21 01:57 unicode_test_01.txt
bash-3.00$ less unicode_test_01.txt
"unicode_test_01.txt" may be a binary file.  See it anyway?
can this file be used as input from command line passphrase?
these passwords are recommended for wlan
will they also work for gpg?
Are they useful for a gnupg  passphrase?
sufficiently random ?
   --passphrase-file file
          Read the passphrase from file file. Only the first line
          will  be  read from file file. This can only be used if
          only  one  passphrase   is   supplied.   Obviously,   a
          passphrase stored in a file is of questionable security
          if other users can  read  this  file.  Don't  use  this
          option if you can avoid it.

Measuring the strength of a randomly selected password
Dear list readers I just found this article.
Measuring the strength of a randomly selected password
Calculating the entropy of a password is here well explained,
I don't know if it is mathematically correct,
no proof is delivered, but it is easy to understand.
The entropy of a randomly selected password is based on its length and
the entropy of each character. The entropy of each character is given by
log-base-2 the size of the pool of characters the password is selected
from - see the formula below:
Thus the entropy of a character selected at random from, say, the
letters (a-z) would be
log2 (26) or 4.7 bits. The table below gives the entropy per character
for a number of different sized character pools.
Character Pool 				Available Characters (n) Entropy Per Character
digits 					10 (0-9) 			3.32 bits
case insensitive letters 		26 (a-z) 			4.7 bits
case sensitive letters and digits 	62 (A-Z, a-z,0-9) 		5.95 bits
all standard keyboard characters 	94 				6.55 bits
So, from the table above, we can see that a 20 character password chosen
at random from the keyboard's set of 94 printable characters would have
more than 128 bits (6.55 * 20) of entropy. A password with this much
entropy is infeasible to break by brute force (exhaustively working
through all possible character combinations).
I use the formula
y= log a base b
a=b ^ y
hence log a base b = ln(a) / ln (b)  base e=2.71828182846....
in I table I used the log function with pase 10 which is irrelevant as
long as I use the same base in the nominator as in the denominator. IIRC
Denominator is down.
The Characters in Unicode
Unicode currently defines just under 100,000 characters,
the entrophy would increase for a 20 character unicode passphrase
to be  20 * 19.93  bits = 398.6 bits.
here is my table
Character pool		Available characters (n)		Entropy per character in unit bits
digits			10	(0-9)				3.32192809
case insensitive
letters			26	(a-z)				4.70043972
case sensitive letters
and digits		62	(A-Z, a-z,0-9)			5.95419631
all standard keyboard
characters plus blank	95	The 95 graphic ASCII characters,
Unicode	
Unicode currently defines
just under 100,000
characters, 		
Unicode and the
ISO/IEC 10646 Universal
Character Set (UCS) have
a much wider
array of characters,	1000000					19.93156857
one unicode character has approx three times the entropy as one ascii
If I have done my homework correct.
6.56985561 * 3.0 = 19.71 bits of entropy for one character
I'd really like to see UTF-8 supported in GnuPG and be able to type some
characters from my keyboard,
and additionally select some cool unicode letters from a language only I
know. use the clipboard and insert that into the passphrase. Or as in
windows posible  alt + unicode number.
hence 20 unicode letters would then have an entropy of 398.6 bits.
With only 7 unicode letters I reach an entropy of 7 * 19.93 = 139.5
bits Entropy
if I have understood it correct.
Can GnuPG accept UTF-8 Characters as passphrase input?
will additional UTF-8 unicode passphrase support increase the entropy
according to my entropy calculations?

Dear Mr. Mudzingwa
Hi Sir! An interesting question,
UX:as: ERROR:
as  may be the assembler, on UNIX you have different tools from the open
source world than some of the proprietary ones.

bash-3.00$ as -V
as: Sun Compiler Common 12 SunOS_i386 snv_64 04/30/2007
When you use gnu software you will need the gnu assembler
you can use gmake instead of make
when you invoke gmake you may specify which assembler you need
like this
gmake AS=gas  # on the invocation command line.
please read the man page of gmake and gas
    *  ld - the GNU linker.
    * as - the GNU assembler.
and you most likely also need the gnu c compiler.
 cc -E -I.. -I../include
looks like the native c compiler for your unix system.
For gnu software some gnu tools are necessary.
man gcc  man gmake  man gas will help.
This is for helping you compile GnuPG on SCO Unix,
One workaround would be to take  PGP for unix from here
the far better solution would be to go for debian linux or some higly
secure BSD flavour.
debian is here  debian.org
right out of the box paranoic security is offereed on the fly from
If you need professional unix support you may get it from sco,
but also IBM and Sun Microsystems as well as HP offers unix.
RedHat and Ubuintu Linux is offered with a support license, but it is so
well coded and easy to use that you most likely won't need any support
if you decide to take the RedHat, Suse or Ubuntu offer from sun.
If you are legally bound and enforced to run only unix certified
software, you can ask sco,  or investigate here:
The unix specification says, that  a set of software,  on a given set of
hardware for a certain period of time is UNIX. Add some extension card
and some minor software configuration then you have no more unix.
GnuPG is quite easy to run on any linux or BSD but needs troubleshooting
when porting to UNIX.
Not only Gnu  compiler tools may cause strange hicups and annoying
results, even simple commands like chmod  chown chgrp  are implemented
different on for example solaris than Linux.  however the manpages can
tell you more about this.
Since you ask on behalf of a bank which I happen to be customer of, it
is in my interest that you only accept OpenBSD for higest security.
That has proactive security and is easy as anything.
here we go:

The following is a copy of the letter sent to Jack Staw today by some
particularly cheeky British privacy activists. It highlights an
embarrassing flaw in the government's proposals for monitoring email
communication and even promises Mr Straw a prison sentence for his troubles.
Dear Mr Straw,
How the E-commerce Bill could send YOU to jail...
Please find at the end of the letter a confession to a crime, which has
been affirmed by Statutory Declaration. The Commissioner of the
Metropolitan Police has been informed that you are in possession of this
You will not be able to understand the confession, because the words
have been scrambled using a strong cryptographic key. This key was
created in your name and has been registered on international public key
The police may come and demand that you supply the key required to make
this message intelligible. If you fail to do so you would be committing
an offence under the E-Commerce Bill rendering you liable to
imprisonment for up to 2 years.
The fact that you don't possess this key won't help you unless you can
prove that you don't have it. I wish you well in proving that it isn't
hidden away on a disk in your secretary's home, or squirreled away on
the Internet somewhere. We might have sent it to you last week; but
according to the Bill, the police won't have to prove you ever had it at
Even if you can prove that you don't have it you would STILL be liable
for imprisonment unless you give information to the police that enables
them to decrypt the key. Unfortunately for you this is impossible,
because we've destroyed all copies of the key in our possession.
If the police ask you keep the demand to hand over the key secret,
telling anyone would render you liable to five years in jail.
So you couldn't complain, or explain your predicament, to the PM or Home

Happily for all of us, the E-Commerce Bill has not yet been enacted by
Parliament, so we have not in fact set you up for jail time. The Bill
will be introduced in the coming session. I hope this exercise has
demonstrated some of the drafting flaws in the Bill as it stands, copies
of which are available from the DTI.
I hope we have also demonstrated that it is not the perpetrators of
crime who would suffer under these draconian new powers, but innocent
parties who are in receipt of communications from miscreants. This is
why such sober organisations as BT, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft have
publicly criticised the Bill at each stage of its development.
I trust that when the Bill reaches the House we can rely on your most
careful scrutiny. Further analysis is available on our web site at:

E-bill reverses burden of proof, says expert
Jane Wakefield ZDNet.co.uk
Published: 23 Sep 1999 15:44 BST
Newly appointed e-Minister Patricia Hewitt was forced to defend the
controversial e-commerce bill Thursday from civil liberties campaigners,
who maintain the bill is a threat to basic civil rights.
Speaking at the Scrambling for Safety conference in London, Hewitt tried
to reassure critics of the bill that they have nothing to fear from
government. She later admitted this was not always true. "In some cases,
government action itself is a threat to freedom," Hewitt said. "But it
is only action by government and law enforcement that can protect
Prompted by questions from the floor, Hewitt had to justify the
inclusion of law-enforcement clauses in the e-commerce bill, which, she
claimed, was a necessary response to the fact "crime has gone electronic
and global".
Under government proposals, the police will have the power to demand
individuals hand over decryption keys if they are under suspicion.
Failure to comply could result in a two year prison sentence, which
breaks the rules of the European Convention on Human Rights, according
to lawyer and civil liberties campaigner Nicholas Bohm. "The Convention
states that individuals have certain rights, such as innocent until
proven guilty and the right not to incriminate oneself," he said. "The
e-commerce bill reverses the burden of proof."
Alan Duncan, shadow spokesman of Trade and Industry, gave an example of
how government proposals could affect the innocent. "If someone who
didn't like me sent me encrypted child pornography and tipped off the
police, they could come round and demand I hand over decryption keys. As
I wouldn't be able to do so, I would be going to prison for two years,"
he said.
Hewitt, who is an ex-secretary general of Liberty, denied that the
proposals reversed the burden of proof but was unable to explain why she
had reached that conclusion.

4. CONCLUSIONS
Key recovery systems are inherently less secure, more costly, and more
difficult to use than similar systems without a recovery feature.
The massive deployment of key-recovery-based infrastructures to meet law
enforcement's specifications will require significant sacrifices in
security and convenience and substantially increased costs to all users
of encryption.
Furthermore, building the secure infrastructure of the breathtaking
scale and complexity that would be required for such a scheme is beyond
the experience and current competency of the field, and may well
introduce ultimately unacceptable risks and costs.
No police officer would be able to operate this.
No lawyer would be able to do so.
They would need to consult third parties, like NSA or even direct
contact skype, if that is the vendor. skype has encryption keys, and it
is possible to decrypt parts of the text message, according to chinese
government. The next step will be to outlaw privacy and deploy chinese
internet censorship.
some of the urls can be difficult to access but google and other search
engines may dig them up. It is an attempt to enforce key escrow. Or an
attempt to destroy open source encryption. It has been rumored that
since GnuPG was funded with money from the german Government, it has a
backdoor, like some rumors said about PGP.
I feel if they cannot decrypt our keys, then it cannot have any
backdoor. It may however once in a lifetime be illegal to use GnuPG.

my question,
can I sign a document or a pdf file with Version 2 of GnuPG ?
 Sign a PDF
You can sign a PDF to indicate your approval. A PDF can be signed more
than once and by more than one person. When you sign a document, your
digital signature appears in the signature field. The appearance of the
signature depends on options you choose. The actual information for your
digital signature is embedded in the PDF. Only PDFs with Reader Rights
enabled can be signed.
can I also sign and encrypt ?  AES256?

Dear littleBrain
I do run Unix,
Solaris is certified as UNIX  according to the single unix

     gpg - OpenPGP encryption and signing tool
     gpg  [--homedir  dir]  [--options  file]  [options]  command
     [args]
     gpg is the OpenPGP part of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG). It
     is a tool to provide digital encryption and signing services
     using  the  OpenPGP  standard.  gpg  features  complete  key
     management  and all bells and whistles you can expect from a
     decent OpenPGP implementation.
     This is the standalone version of gpg.  For desktop use  you
     should consider using gpg2.
If you dorun solaris UNIXC  on x86  or  AMD64,
then you get the software as binary  here.

end of unix definition.
all this are UNIX03, on supported hardware  according to the current
UNIX 03  standard,
I can only help you with  solaris,
not with  Apple Mac OSX,  HP-UX  or  AIX.
Which also actually is unix, but a different unix.
Unix  api documentation in general you will get from the operating
system vendor. And they has most likely ported many gnu projects tou
their hardware. Unix is a wide concept.
Linux  and BSD is not exactly unix,
but has better Gnu Integration.
GPG  or  GnuPG  or  Bsd Privacy Guard, works very well and smooth under
all Linux and BSD operating systems,
on all CPUs which contains a linux or  BSD port.

Dear Brian
This is the core math of  OpenPGP
bash-3.00$ gpg  --version
Supported algorithms:
Pubkey: RSA, RSA-E, RSA-S, ELG-E, DSA
Cipher: 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA224
Compression: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB, BZIP2
If used apart from manually invoked messages and files,
and without the use of a proper passphrase, manually keyed.
I don't think it would be much useful. It would be much the same as
saving your passphrase or even typing it in the source code.
But this is known to me.
# I'm involved here
OpenTLS is a project to replace OpenSSL, and is divided in three smaller
packages, NetCrypto, NetPKI and NetTLS.
It's been worked on since the autumn 2003, and at the time of writing,
the last major part of NetCrypto is being worked on. The other two
components are still entirely vaporware, hardly even at the planning
stage. It was known from the beginning that this project would evolve
for live applications which runs distributed  like  OpenVPN or
skype  or  sip-communicator,
this paper tells some interesting stuff:
this is for running applications  distributed over then net,  eg client
server computing and what needs a passphrase when loggin on the network.
Human authentication like in OpenPGP is essential.
if a piece of software is to do the authentication,
you may even save to hard disk the files. But I cannot figure any
understandable benefit for that.
Why do you want the software to encrypt unlike PGP,
which encrypts with a human token called the passphraze?
bash-3.00$ touch  somethingIdliketohide.txt
bash-3.00$ gpg  -c  somethingIdliketohide.txt
# I am prompted twice for my passphraze,
# which would be silly to put in any sourcecode.
gpg: WARNING: `somethingIdliketohide.txt' is an empty file
bash-3.00$ ls -l  somethingIdliketohide.txt*

you may even use  gpg -c  --cipher-algo  AES256  If you prefer.

BLURB works on the fly but at least my instance of openssl with blowfish
in cbc cipher block chaining mode did not decrypt the blurb output.
hence from what I can see, blurb introduces something fundamental new,
which cannot be achieved with openssl or gnuPG.
I tried to encrypt twice, with the same passphrase, which should be the
same as the ciphertext.
And opened the output in ghex2.
blurb does the trick. If you want to encrypt or decrypt a msg to
yourself or someone able to run blurb. Then it is a good bet.
If OpenSSL supports blowfish, why is it incompatible to blurb?

@_subject: Voltage IBE 
Hash: SHA256
This is identity based encryption,
I've heard about it.
Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) takes a completely new approach to the
problem of encryption. IBE can use any arbitrary string as a public key,
enabling data to be protected without the need for certificates.
Protection is provided by a key server that controls the mapping of
identities to decryption keys.
It looks similar to vanish, which is time stamped and duration
dependent. Also no encryption, only to a time frame.
I only know and understand S/MIME and OpenPGP.
IBE Identity based encryption is supposed to be easier than OpenPGP. If
I remember correctly.
   Identity-based encryption (IBE) is a public-key encryption technology
   that allows a public key to be calculated from an identity, and the
   corresponding private key to be calculated from the public key.
Looks insecure to me.
Sincerely yours,
