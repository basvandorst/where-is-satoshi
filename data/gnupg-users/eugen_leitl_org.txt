@_subject: Mutt 1.4i and gpg (GnuPG) 1.0.7 
I'm switching from pine. Does anyone have a sane .muttrc and .gpg/options
I could use with above (fairly bleeding edge) versions?

@_subject: Using "ultimate" Owner Trust 
I did it for another person's key, since I generated it for her, and transferred it over ssh to her machine.

@_subject: Using "ultimate" Owner Trust 
Her shell account box was too low on entropy (I tried), and she doesn't
have a local GPG copy (it's Windows). This is clearly not a deep paranoia
setup, just a convenient way to use encryption with pine on a shell mail
In an ideal world she would have generated her key herself.
I was having trouble due to an unfortunate interaction of 1.0.6
unwittingly preceding 1.0.7 in $PATH and pinepgp (it broke with 1.0.7),
and managed to nuke the trust database because 1.0.6 couldn't handle
1.0.7's format.
No, I don't really trust my key, as I'm habitually accessing my DSL *nix
box containing the keyring via ssh sessions. The only trusted key is the one which was generated on and never leaves an air gapped machine, no?

I've tried doing exactly the same thing like you, and I failed. I would be also interested in hearing about a solution.

Sorry for being blunt, but Martin Schoch sent a followup to a private mail
to the list by manually adding gnupg-users@ to the headers. In case you
were not aware of that, Martin, this is simply unacceptable behaviour. Try
not doing that again. It's rude as hell..
I've explained what I've meant by my *apparently* inflammatory comments in
a followup mail to him, offlist. I guess I have now to do that to this
list. Well, I only have to work today.
I'm not representing any official position (duh, there is no official
position), but you seem to assume that the open source movement attempts
to create a global GNU world order, aiming to shoot commercial software
vendors out of the sky. This is not something that is desirable and what
will happen. Free software caters to the needs of a specific user
community, which hardly overlaps with proprietary software users.
I personally think that a sudden influx of clueless proprietary software users would considerably harm the community, while not actually helping the users migrate. Looks clearly lose/lose to me.
You've got a bunch of misconceptions here. 1) We're not here to save the
world. 2) Open source developers typically develop in their spare time, on
shoestring budgets or no budgets at all. They're typically using open
source operating systems, because they suit them best. Similiar applies to
its user community. Proprietary systems are expensive, and development
environments for them are even more so. You have to keep paying through
your nose for the privilege of keeping up with updates. Donations of
proprietary systems to open source projects are infrequent (mildly put).
As such, best support for open source project is, unsurprisingly, offered
for open source platforms. If you want to change it, donate
money/hardware/software to the open source project of your choice if you
want support for your platform.
Even better, pick up programming yourself.
If you're a Windows user, ask Google for Cygwin. It's a free/open source
*nix compatibility shell some nice people built for Windows. Install it,
download last version of GPG (or whatever package you want) which builds
there, and get familiar with the build process. Then download the newest
version, and try building it as well. It will break in interesting ways.
Try to understand the error messages. If you can't, ask the developers.
They're busy, but they might help you.
You might not become a programmer (though it is a possibility), but you at least would 1) learn something in the process, becoming an empowered user 2) are not a dead weight on the community. Similiar applies to bugs. Report them in a well documented way to appropriate channels.
I am an end user. I'm very happy with packages like GPG, which typically build out of the box by make test
make install
I do not care for Windows users, nor do I expect them to use and appreciate a command line tool. If you feel like writing wrappers for it (like a certain Outlook plugin), go for it.
I do not care for RMS thinks, or for what Redmond does, as long as they don't contaminate the hardware base. (Having to switch to open hardware would be an expensive nuisance).
If that's your dream, go for it. I'm happy with it as is.
No flames. We just disagree.

@_subject: what do you think about Biometrie 
There are reasons why biometrics suck (largely, you can't revoke and
reissue new ones, they're not all that reliable, and you can fake them
with finite effort), but you're citing a worst case.
Just use the iris pattern, the vein pattern in your palm, etc.  The more
of them you use the lower is the probability that you can fake them (and
higher the number of false alarms, of course).
Don't use biometrics standalone. But they sure can supplement a secret,
making overall for a higher resistance to attacks.

"the Linux community" (he can't tell advocacy crowd apart from open
sourcers) doesn't give a flying fsck either way. In fact it would be
arguably good, since keeping the bloat down and the quality up. (The rats
are lining up for *BSD, anyway. Eeek!).
Hey, somebody must have really pissed him off.
Luckily, we don't have to care either about what Dvorak or his readers

It's not the question of being true to some (abstract) principles. On the
short term, at least. It's rather: can you afford to pay the bill on the
long run? You're starting to rely on something which is a) out of your control b) has a commercially-driven incentive to remain a) Good luck. You're going to need it.
The first one is always for free. Unless you've got your private, quite
unlimited stash you're heading right on towards neck-irons, buster.
Have fun in the salt mines. You'll like it in there.

@_subject: Gpg and pine 
I'm going the opposite way (pine->mutt). I've had a working 1.0.6 GPG
setup with pine (pgp4pine), but it broke when I upgraded to 1.0.7. So stick with 1.0.6.
Why would you want to migrate from mutt, anyway? It's a much superior

Yeah, if you've got good dealer connections, you can always get good
drugs. Unfortunately, it's very illegal, and dealers frequently get
busted. Clean syringes are getting more expensive, too, because they're so
in demand. So sometimes you suddenly run out of your source, and have to
face cold turkey right into the eye. Kinda sucks, eh?
I'm happy for you that you've got a good source now, and are confident you
can sustain your habit in the future. Unfortunately, many people are not
as lucky as you. I hear they're into seeds, spore prints and starter
cultures now. It's sure nice to be completely in control of your means of
production, don't you agree?

@_subject: What is wrong here? 
On my most academic lists most people seem to be out of the orifice most
of the time. The more academic, the deeper the reverse insertion. I
attribute this to a insufficient application of the shunt procedure in the
critical infancy phase.
