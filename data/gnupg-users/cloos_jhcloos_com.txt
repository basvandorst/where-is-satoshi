The trick might be to have the cron daemon itself act as the daemon
storing the passphrase.  It would provide the process w/ a FD to read
the passphrase from; the process can then pipe that direct to the gpg
Another option is to have the daemon sleeping in the background, and
use cron to send it a wakeup signal.  Again, it has the phrase in RAM
and can pass it to gpg via a pipe.
I've not spent much time (ie more than a few seconds) thinking about
the security issues of these proposals.  Obviously of course the RAM
used to store the phrase must be mlock(2)ed (or the equivalent), but
beyond that....
Comments welcome.

Yes, but it requires an extension to php.
Unlike, eg perl or python or etc, php cannot yet run a subcommand with
multiple pipes between parent and child.  Were it able to, the
solution is to do what the gui frontend(s?) to gpg do: a pipe for the
plaintext, one for the cyphertext, one for the passphrase (as
required), for for statii and one for stderr.
A proposed syntax would be to extend php's popen() to take either an
array of direction strings, or a multi-char string of directions to
signify more than one pipe.  It would then return an array of FDs,
one for each pipe.

Has come up before.  If you just want algo 7 as prefered, creating a
new encrypt-to sub key and depricating the current one ought to get
the job done.  If you want another order you'll have to hack the src,
or do a binary edit on the key.  IIRC, importing the edited key should DTRT.  (But be sure to back
everything up before trying, just in case. :)
Also, I guess the latest pgp does allow editing preferences.  You
could try using that to edit the ring.
--edit-key-preferences is definitely a wish list item, though.

Between --list-packets, (the rfc?) and the src it shouldn't be too
hard to work out what octets to change, given a desire to keep the
number of algorithms in the prf constant.  hmm.  [goes read rfc]..
changing the number of algorithms might be just as easy.  You need
to change the 16bit length of hashed subpackets field, the usu 8bit
length of subpacket field and add the new 8bit algo numbers.
And then resign the hashed portion of the packet.
It'd almost certainly be faster to code it up than the do a couple
manually. :)

Use the OCRA font.  I did that in the past scaled so that the key used
up most of a single letter sized sheet of paper.  I probably used mpage?
or enscript? to do the conversion to PostScript (it has been a while :).
OCRA was designed to be scanned first and read by humans second, so it
should give the best performance for this purpose.  And you can follow
along to confirm or type in the key if necessary.
OCRB would be the second choice, but I'd go for OCRA.
CTAN has metafont versions of OCRA and OCRB if you use TeX.
You can get Type1 and TTF versions of OCRA from the ocr-a-font? project
on sourceforge.

v> If so, what is the recommended font and size to be used for accurate OCR ?
v> OCR-A, OCR-B,  Ordinary Courier 10,  other ?
I've tried it once.  I used ocr-a since it was available and seemed
likely to be easiest to scan.  And, although some might disagree, I
also find it easy to read.
I just gave it a try w/o paper, using mpage to generate postscript,
OCRA for the font, gs to render the ps to pbm, and gocr to extract
the text.  I needed to run >>tr \;_ ::<< on the extracted text, but
with that paperkey was able to generate a new secring.
So be aware that you may need to massage the ocr'ed data to recover
paperkey's format, but it should mostly work.
Using OCRB or Courier, gocr wasn't able to recover the text well enough.
Tesseract did better with Courier-Bold, but needed >>tr Ol 01<<.
But tesseract *badly* fails to grok OCRA!
I suspect that actual printing and scanning won't be *too* much worse.

I've just noticed that since I've upgraded to gpg 2.1 it has been unable
to retrieve keys from the keyservers.
My gpg.conf still has 'keyserver hkp://127.0.0.1', and I've tried adding
that also to dirmngr.conf, but it always fails.
Strace(8)ing dirmngr showed that it cannot handle ip addresses in the
URI.  Switching to hkp://localhost worked.
Typing is still quite challenging, so please excuse that I'm not
offering a patch.
I'm currently using 2.1.5 via the gentoo ebuild.
