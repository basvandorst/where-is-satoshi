Thanx for your input.
Ok, so Im guessing the RSA-modulus (p and q) are stored on the card
along with the private exponents, or
perhaps the private key in its whole, already computed?
How much of the RSA-operations are made on the card, in terms of key
generation, signature making etc?
Does anyone know the max storage capability of the v2.0 OpenPGP-cards? A
few K?

Im no expert in the card reader/card driver area but; Im also running
Linux Mint 9 with gpg2 and keys on smartcard.
Im not sure which card reader you have (I've got an Omnikey reader) but
in my case I pretty soon had to abandon
the CCID-driver (gpg built-in) in favor of PCSC. Try:
You should find /usr/sbin/pcscd running when checking running processes.

Just a quick question to clarify things. I've been playing with gpg/gpg2
and g10 openPGP smart cards v2.0 now a bit.
As I understand there is no way to keep the private _and_ the public
keys solely on the card?
Gpg always uses the public key/pubring.gpg on the harddrive.
So suppose if I wanted to have public and private keys on the card (to
be able to use it on computers which doesn't have
my pubring.gpg/secring.gpg) I must also have a card containing the
trustdb-file and perhaps even a gpg.conf file?
Thanx in advance,

Thank you for your quick response.
A couple of follow-up questions:
Im noticing that in an "empty" gpg-installation, when I run the
--card-edit command, gpg creates the
keyring files (0 bytes in size) in the homedir. When I then run the
generate command to create keys on the
card the keyring-files grow to a couple of bytes in size (secring
containing stubs that point to the card, right?) and
pubring.gpg containing the public key (since I can encrypt only when the
card is not inserted).
So even if I generate the keys directly on the smartcard, using
--card-edit and generate commands, do
the actual public key key mass populate the smart card?
Follow-up question 2:
If I "fetch" the public key from a keyserver, on a computer with an
empty gpg installation, and import it,
does that store the public key on the card or is pubring.gpg created and

Thank you very much. Now things are perfectly clear.
