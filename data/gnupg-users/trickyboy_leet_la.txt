@_subject: Problem: Several selfsig 
Hi everybody,
I generated a GnuPG certificate but I see that I have two self-signatures for each of my userID:
gpg> check
uid  John Doe sig!3        ABCD1234 2015-06-18  [self-signature]
sig!3        ABCD1234 2015-06-14  [self-signature]
uid  John Doe sig!3        ABCD1234 2015-06-18  [self-signature]
sig!3        ABCD1234 2015-06-14  [self-signature]
uid  John Doe sig!3        ABCD1234 2015-06-18  [self-signature]
sig!3        ABCD1234 2015-06-14  [self-signature]
Here is how I proceeded: I generated a key (which generated an encryption subkey automatically).
I added 2 userID.
I added a signature subkey. So I let only my 2 subkeys (so, E and S) on my laptop as recommended on a website I read.
(I also added an authentification subkey because I?d like to test a ssh/gpg setting later).
So my questions are:
Did I proceed correctly or did I miss a recommended step ?
Why I have 2 self-sig on each of my userID and is it a problem ? And, if so, how to proceed to remove one of them ?
I think that maybe I see two self-signature because I created two signature keys: The main key which is for signature and certification (SC), plus the signature subkey I added. Thank you for your help,
