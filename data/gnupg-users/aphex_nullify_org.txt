I have been able to successfully cross-compile GnuPG 1.0.4-1 to include the IDEA cipher for Windows.  Since this binary now includes both RSA and IDEA, it should be fully backwards compatible with PGP 2.6.x.
The following changes were made from a "standard" cross-compile:
1. Statically linked idea.c.  Unlike Cygwin, this release requires no DLLs.
2. Removed deprecated warning when using IDEA
3. Removed secure memory warnings (Windows doesn't support secure memory).
The patch was fairly trivial and appears to work fine, but I have not done extensive testing so use caution.  The binary can be downloaded at   Please email me if you have any questions or problems.

I guess that's why no one has EVER asked for an IDEA capable Windows version?  I guess there are no Windows users who might want to communicate with PGP 2.6x users or use most remailers?
I am not trying to prove a point.  I merely wish to allow those who want a GnuPG+IDEA binary to be able to have one.  I give it away free and provide source.  Isn't that the point of Free Software?  If commercial users don't want it, they can download the official release.  But for all noncommercial users, there is NO reason why they shouldn't be able to have IDEA support.
The no patents clause of the GPL is stupid!  Why can't we provide TWO versions and let the users decide which best meets there needs?  The unix users have had this choice for some time, why are the Window's users less deserving?  I am not taking anything away from Werner or anyone else.
So it's real simple.  Either leave me alone and let the users decide which version they want, or force me to stop.  I am not trying to steal anyone's work or make money off it.  I am merely adding some much requested functionality.

I am almost finished with an updated binary (and source) for a MSVC port of
GnuPG 1.0.7a-cvs that has these changes.  It should be out in a few days.  BTW,
if anyone using the nullify binary has any problems, please feel free to e-mail
me.  Most of the GnuPG developers use unix, and I can help solve Win32 problems.
