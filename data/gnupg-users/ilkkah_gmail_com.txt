@_subject: Preventing temporary files? 
I'm running Gnupg in an automated environment, from PHP, with
proc_open(), which allows to open pipes, which in turn can be used to
write input and read output. So it seems quite secure, no cleartext or
passphrases in any temporary files.
However, Gnupg still wants to use temporary files in some internal
operations. I would not want to have even write access in the
directory (--homedir), since that's another thing to worry about, and
another step for the user to take care of.
Is there any way to prevent gnupg from making or requiring these
temporary files? I suppose it should be technically possible to do the
encrytion without them?
Thank you,
Ilkka Huotari

I have the PHP side working. The thing that I have problems with is this:
gpg: failed to create temporary file `bin/gpg/. Permissio
n denied

Ah ok,
Thank you so much! The keyring is not going to change so I think I can
safely use the --lock-never. I can take the write permissions out of
the keyring to make it sure even...
After a quick testing, seems to work ok.
