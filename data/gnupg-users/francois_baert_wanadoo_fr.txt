I would like to install the kernel-source of my os RedHat 9.0
I got the source from a mirror of kernel.org and try to install it.
rpm -ivh kernel-source-2.4.20-6.i386.rpm
error: kernel-source-2.4.20-6.i386.rpm: V3 DSA signature :BAD, key ID db42a60e
error: kernel-source-2.4.20-6.i386.rpm cannot be installed.
After reading Faqs and Howtos found on gnupg.org (it takes me a couple of days) I found "the linux kernel archives OpenPGP Signature" according to
this paper I try to obtain the public key using my key ID db42a60e with
gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 0xdb42a60e
I found in my pubring.gpg with gpg --list-public-keys this:
pub  1024D/DB42A60E 1999-09-23 RedHat, Inc sub  2048g/961630A2 1999-09-23
Then following the literature I submit:
rpm -K kernek-source-2.4.20-6.i386.rpm
I got :
kernel-source-2.4.20-6.i386.rpm: (SHA1) DSA sha1 MD5 GPG NOT OK
I try with rpm -K --nosignature . . .
I got kernel-source-2.4.20-6.i386.rpm sha1 MD5 NOT OK
I confess that I don't know what kind of trials I am going to do ??
I would appreciated if somebody could give me some advices.
