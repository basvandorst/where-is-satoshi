@_subject: Elliptic curves in gnupg status? 
Hash: SHA1
i recently read about ecc (elliptic curves crypt)
after googling, i found this:
is there any plan to get ecc in mainstream gnupg?
most stuff i found about gnupg and ecc is outdated.
does somebody know something about this?
i own a OpenPGP Smartcard v2.
does it / will it support ECC, or do i have to wait for an
OpenPGP Smartcard v3 ? :)
thanks in advance

it would be nice to know, which commands you used, for better
understanding what error you are having.

@_subject: Passphrase problem in gpgsm 2.0.14 
i am wondering if  will get
fixed any time soon?
i wanted to ask this on the bugtracker's page but i think it is not
possible to comment on bugs, other people reported. is this true?
i really think this is a important bug, because i cannot use it as drop
in replacement for ssh-agent. and need to use gpg-agent instead of
ssh-agent, because of the smartcard support, which works nicely. but
sometimes i need also ssh-support for gpg-keys without smartcard, and i
don't want to change to ssh-agent anytime i need this feature.
also i want to point out, gpg-agent 2.0.14 is in lucid with long term
support. it would be nice, if a patch for this problem would get into lucid.
