@_subject: java (little bit OT) 
hi everybody!
sorry for being a little OT.
I'm looking for a java implementation to decrypt gnupg-encrypted files, by submitting the private-key, the passphrase and the encrypted data - without gnupg installed! (so to decrypt data on every platform with a java-vm installed)
any hints?
