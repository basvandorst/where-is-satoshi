@_subject: sending public key to key server 
I have tried sending a public key to a key server using gpg 1.06 unter linux.
sending with
gpg --keyserver name --send-keys username
works fine.,,,
doing the same using windows nt an gpg for win32 (1.06 also)
gpg: write failed: ec=87
gpg: Verbindung zu 'keysserv.xy' kann nicht aufgebaut werden: No such file or  directory
says he can not connect the keyserver, but it is present, and also
checks can be made via pgp...
is their a problem with the 1.06 for win32?

at least I can tell you what registry entries (on NT) have to be made.
I have a small reg.script to be startet with
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Mingw32]
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Mingw32\NLS]
the homedir of the users key is stored in this case in the userhome of the samba source
all the rest can be copied in the appropriate localtion on hard disk

@_subject: gpg 1.06,  can read pgp 7.0? 
with the idea.dll and the apropriate "option-file" in the key-directory it is possible to encrypt pgp 6.x files/e-mails
does this also work with pgp 7.0 ?
if yes, changes needed in option-file or another dll?

@_subject: AW: gpg and outlook plugin 
so this is what I found:
when installing the plugin everthing seems to work
when encrypting an e-mail and pushing the "send-button"
it takes about 20 to 30 seconds till the key-windows with the
key of the receipient appears. pushing ok will send the
message, but
opening the message from the receipient will only bring up
an empty body message
does anybody have a solution for this problem. or will we
be driving in a dead end street?
