@_subject: Cannot encrypt to reenabled key after migration 
Hey folks,
I have a keypair that was created with gpg 1.4.20 and currently is disabled.
I installed gpg 2.1.20 and tried to enable this key, but get the following
\>gpg --edit-key testkey
gpg (GnuPG) 2.1.20; Copyright (C) 2017 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

gpg: starting migration from earlier GnuPG versions
gpg: porting secret keys from '.../gnupgHome/secring.gpg' to gpg-agent
gpg: key C4EE06ABF10675C4: secret key imported
gpg: migration succeeded
gpg: checking the trustdb

gpg: waiting for file '.../gnupgHome/pubring.gpg' to become accessible ...
gpg: waiting for file '.../gnupgHome/pubring.gpg' to become accessible ...
When I repeat the edit-key command it works ok.
Then I want to encrypt something to this key, but get the same error
\>gpg --encrypt -r testkey

As you can see it never works, until I use list-key or list-public-key
command. After this I am able to encrypt to this key.
(I am using Windows 8.1 64.)
Anybody had/has this problem too?

Thank you for the hint. The message went way with 2.1.19.
