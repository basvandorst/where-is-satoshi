Hi!  What encryption algorithm do we use in OpenPGP

Please excuse my ignorance but I have a question after looking at the
list. It is my impression that I can choose an algorithm for my
machine and whoever else I communicate with can choose another
algorithm.  Is this correct?   Why would anyone choose AES-128 instead
of something more secure, say AES-256?

(Definitely Godzilla) But why do people tell me that DH, DSA, and RSA
under 2048 are unacceptable?
How can I find whats on my list?

Thanks a bunch that was easy.  So mine is 2048 with AES-256.  So whats
all the complaining about the defaults?

Lets assume the people I email have the same preferences.  So how
long, and at what cost would it take to brute force crack a captured

what about the 2048-bit DSA part of it?

OK, I see.  So . . . if brute force is impossible, then what sort of
an attack is possible?

Lets assume I run Ubuntu live from USB stick or cd when I need secure
messaging so an attacker cannot predict what machine i will send my
message from and there will be nothing left on the machine.  The
encrypted message is captured but the adversary does not have access
to me.  What sort of attack has any chance to decrypt the message?

So in other words the message can not be read by some govt genius with
a rack of computers??

Oh OK.  So there is a chance that someone has a special mathematical
trick to reduce the key-space hence their need for things like
Saville, BATON, etc.

@_subject: problems opening .asc file 
i was sent a .asc file as an attachment.  when i try to open it it says
"Couldn't decrypt file: No data"
and on the signature part of another email i get this:
OpenPGP Security Info
Error - signature verification failed
gpg command line and output:
gpg: Signature made Wed 14 Aug 2013 07:32:07 AM EDT using DSA key ID
gpg: BAD signature from "xxxxxxxxxxx.com>"
however when i do:
gpg --sign-key xxxxxxxx
it tells me it is signed by my key.
What am i doing wrong here?

right.  for this email address i use thunderbird and everything seems
to work.  however i cant get my thunderbird to work with hush.com
