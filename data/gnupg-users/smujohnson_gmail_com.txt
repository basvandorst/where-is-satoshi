@_subject: STEED - Usable end-to-end encryption 
I read this briefly, and I'd actually like to read it over later and maybe
contribute some ideas.  The lack of people caring about cryptography is
quite apparent, and may be solved with some good ideas of making things less
annoying / hard to use.
I'd be happy to help.
