@_subject: SSH Agent keys >4096 bit? 
I am trying to use gpg-agent for my ssh keys as well as my gpg keys,
but am unable to add my 8192 bit ssh key to the agent.
Agent log reports: "2012-05-03 17:48:02 gpg-agent[2190] ssh keys
greater than 4096 bits are not supported"
The limit appears to be arbitarily set in agent/command-ssh.c
following a max mpi_data_size.
Does anyone know why the limit is set at 4096 bits, and whether there
are any plans for supporting SSH keys of lengths greater than 4096bit
in the gpg-agent?

Thank you for trying to return this discussion to the original topic.
My intention as OP was to ask how difficult it would be to implement
(it seems to just be a magic-value in the code), rather than the
discussion on the (non?)merits of 8k keys this thread appears to have
become. (Which seems to have a split opinion amongst the
more-knowledgeable-than-me residents of this list).

Might I point out that discussion is with respect to an 8k RSA SSH key
for SSH authentication, not for email. A 2 second delay during the
initialization of an SSH connection is not a problem.
Find one with a better battery/more-efficient processor if these sorts
of calculations would really be an issue, compared to the general
radio use of the phone.

I created the 8k keys prior to understanding the full effects
reasoning behind a 1k/2k key simply because it was't particularly
computationally expensive for me to do, and I saw no harm in being
overly cautious with a longer key than average.
I see no purpose though (at this stage, with my public key spread
around a variety of locations without issue) in generating a new
'smaller' key for the sole purpose of being able to use GPG's SSH
agent, requiring me to change the public key in every location.
I think this is fairly irrelevant to the discussion. Yes there is an
overhead, but performing the calculations is not a significant
concern. (If a server is getting lots of fake logon attempts, you need
to sort out your firewall instead).
