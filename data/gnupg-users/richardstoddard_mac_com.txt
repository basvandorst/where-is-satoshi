@_subject: commands for gpg keychain access 
Hash: SHA1
I just installed GnuPG for Mac along with gpg keychain access and the  Mail plugin. I had to generate a new key because I couldn't remember  the passphrase for my old key, which was associated with a different  address. I'd like to now edit to add other addresses, but can't find  a list of commands for terminal. I may have overlooked the obvious,  in which case I apologize. Can someone point me to a list of commands  for keychain access?
BTW - is my signature valid?

Thanks for the help. Another question, however. I would have liked to  have not used SHA1 hash, but that was the only option I saw when  creating my key. Will I be able to change the hash on this key or  will I need to create a new one? Folks on this list helped me through  this when I was on Windows, and now I need help with the Apple. (BTW  - - no regrets having switched.)

Thanks. I think I understand it all, and will tackle it this evening.  The problem I had when generating the key is that even though I  checked 4096 as the size, only the subkey is 4096. I didn't have an  option for the primary key.

I tried to edit the contents, but when I click on GnuPG in system  preferences I get the message  "You cannot open GnuPG preferences  pane on this computer. Contact the developer of this software for a  newer version." Anyone have any idea what my problem is? Should I try  to reinstall? (I'm using 1.4.7.)  Or is there some work-around?
I looked at this last night, and may take a crack at editing it if I  can't get the preference panel to work.
Thanks or the help.
