Hello Everyone--
to be able to include encryption functionality into the system such that it
does the following:
encrypts the mail.
I think I can do this, and it will be quite cool.  There are only a couple
problems I cannot figure out:
requirements.  As it stands now, if I just have the machine create the keys
it fails out saying there isn't enough randomness in the system -- and it
takes forever.  (more so than creating keys with PGP).
directory on the fly and generate the keyring from the information in the
database and then run GPG?  Can I forgo the keyrings and just supply the
keys at the command line?
Or should I just wait until someone writes a GPG PHP3 module?
Thanks for any input.

any scarier than as a file in a filesystem?
Nothing would please me more than to develop a system that 'feels right' as
far as security goes.  Obviously, storing private keys in a database would
require very tight security on said databse server.
It is dangerous at any point when a 3rd party (the web mail client, a.k.a
the webserver process) is given the ability to sign/encrypt data using
several different peoples private keys....but is there any way around this?
Thanks for the input....

this sounds like a pretty scary idea.
