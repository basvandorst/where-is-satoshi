I suppose its time for my two cents:
I'm sure someone will rebuke me for what I did, though I was curious
as to this keyserver spam issue as well. So I uploaded a key with a
spamgourmet disposible email address, that email address was solely
for the purpose of checking if spammers harvested addresses from
If your familar with how spamgourmet works, youll know by default that
email address is only capable of recieving three emails before they
just get dropped into the intarweb ether.
I did get 3 articles of spam, sent to that address, the first one came
the day after key upload, then 2 more the day (or was it the two
days?) after that.
So, you see, I myself am fairly confident spammers do harvest
keyservers for emails, (and if they didnt I'd be surprised, if I were
a spammer I would..) but at the same time the convenience they offer
me far out weighs the problems. So far gmail's been doing pretty damn
well at sorting spam from none spam, so well infact that spam isnt a
problem to me, I couldnt care less.

Any comments on modifying the number of iterations like was done here
to something higher? Looking at the rfc it would seem that the number
of iterations is some arbitary value set by the client and taking a
guess here one would expect gpg's value to be on the low end of the
scale to accommodate 486 users and the like.
(I know that iteration count will linearly effect the time the S2K
function will take to run, and also the time it takes to bruteforce
the password.)
I take it this will effect all password to key generation and hence
the private key's encryption as well as gpg -c?

loop-aes is not in the vanilla kernel sources.
dm-crypt and cryptoloop are.
cryptoloop is depreciated, use dm-crypt instead.
dm-crypt'd main advantage is that it's already in the kernel, whereas
loop-aes is a add-on. Look at the different modes of encryption
supported and make a decision from there.
I use dm-crypt for what its worth, though I wouldn't have any problems
with using loop-aes instead.

There are 3 ways to generate a key from a password outlined in the rfc:
1. Merely hashing password.

The thirds the best. I [believe] gpg uses that.

Lets say there are about 100000 words in your dictionary. Lets also

Now for password of random characters we would need:
log(340282366920938463463374607431768211456)/log(100) =

For a password of random words we would need:

@_subject: Password length paranoia 
(I know. We already have lots of threads about the net on password length).
Heres my two cents, from someone who has zero security/cryptographic
background (:
Bruteforcing 256bit keys is on a level of hardness that pretty much
renders it impossible.
So I wouldn't really bother trying to make a password of similar strength.
128bit keys are still regarded as fine.
Even the 112bit of 3DES, which is the only MUST have symmetric cipher
in openpgp, is still fine (though not prefered for new applications).
And dont forget that generating a key from the password is a lengthy
operation, involving hashing thousands of times (how many in gpg?).
These Iterations linearly increase the difficulty of a bruteforce attempt.
So if you ask me greater than 20 random chars (95^20 > 2^128) is
getting a bit excited.
I vote 14-20 for a sane range for most people.
(14 being people not really concerned with bruteforcing)
Add to this my opinion that if someone compromised your system far
enough to get your secret key, you have big issues - like them
trojaning the gpg binary.
(I fully advocate random strings for passwords. The reason being the
more you type in any password the better you remember it, and the more
annoyed you get at typing in alot of chars. It's also easier to
evaluate the password strength - for the whole of this email assume I

RSA keysize will influence how long it takes you to encrypt or sign a
message. But how long the RSA signing/encryption step takes is going
to be the same no matter what the message length. That's because you
are only ever signing a hash of the message or encrypting the
symmetric session key used to encrypt the message.
I doubt I could notice the difference on my computer between
encrypting at 20GB tarball with a 1024bit key or a 4096bit key. With
large amounts of data most of the time is spent on the symmetric
encryption (or perhaps on compression or disk io?). The bigger the
amount of data you're encrypting the less you're going to notice RSA
keysize differences :).

Hey folks,
I'm wanting to store my OpenPGP key on paper, I suspect this is
something someone else has already done. The motivation behind this is
that paper is the most stable backup medium I have.
I have tried printing out a key, then scanning and using gocr on the result.
That was unsuccessful due to the high number of errors in the OCR
phase, I suspect with a carefully selected font and font size I could
sigificantly cut down on that error rate.
Now since even a 99.99% accuracy in the OCR phase is still going to
cause a large headache when you're trying to track down what one or
few characters got interpreted wrong amongst a screenfull of them, I
thought some error correction would be a very good idea.
(First thing that came to mind was par2+base64 but I think this might
have have a few issues.).
Then came the realisation that printing out english letters was a
woefully inefficent way to store binary data on a piece of paper. I'm
certain there must be more compact and robust ways (ie: without subtly
similar symbols like 0 and O) way to store information.
So...Does anyone :
Know of a system that can take binary data and output an image to be
printed out, that is then capable of extracting that binary data from
an imperfect scan of the image.
OR Have any success stories regarding printing, scanning then OCRing
keys or any other data?
If so how did you do it? (what did you use for error correction, what
font, what size etc..)

I don't see any worthwhile gain over setting a strong passphrase, and
then secret sharing that passphrase with ssss.
In Roberts example if you were to use ssss+paperkey you'd merely
export an encrypted secret key, and then print in the line above it an
ssss share.
As far as I can see this would produce an equivalent state of affairs.
The biggest practical difference is that since you're secret sharing
just a passphrase and not a secret key it's going to be less typing to
reconstruct your key.
It does add an extra step to the situation, but I do like the one tool
one job philosophy.
[BTW: Adding paperkey to the tools section of gnupg.org would be good.
I only found it because I read the mailing list :].

@_subject: Key safety vs Backup : History of a bad day (key-restoration 
Hmm, maybe I lost my meaning in trying to avoid verbosity.
If I decided my mum, dad and brother could be trusted, I'd encrypt my
private key with a strong password.
Then I'd use ssss to generate 3 shares, which when combined would
reveal the password to the private key.
Now I'd distribute to my mum, dad and brother a copy of my private key
and a password share each.
Now lets say my private key ended up being 200 characters and my
password 20 characters.
To reconstruct it I would have to type in 200 characters once, and
around 60 characters to recover the password (from the three shares)
Constrast that to if I applied secret sharing to the unencrypted
private key, I would, in order to recover my private key have to type
in around 600 characters (from the three shares).
ssss is open source and written in C,  I don't see how there is any
case for longer-term storage by avoiding ssss and using just paperkey.
(If C compilers disappear paperkey and gpg aren't going to be very
usable either)
To include secret sharing in paperkey would indeed result in fewer
components and fewer steps because you're inserting the functionality
like that of ssss into paperkey and thus making paperkey more complex.
I suppose thats a preference thing, as I mentioned I like the one tool
one job philosophy.
Now in light of having to type in more data (and thus one must store
more data reliably) and replicating functionality already provided by
ssss/paperkey I'm not seeing any advantage.
But! It is clear, there is a demand for secret sharing in paperkey :)
[I've made the assumption that the shares are the same size as the
secret, this  makes sense to me as you're encoding things as points in

Not answering your questions but two handy tools I like :)
A while ago we had a big discussion regarding printing out keys for backup,
which (I think) prompted David Shaw to write a following small program to
assist those wanting to do so, here's part of the description of that program:
"Due to metadata and redundancy, OpenPGP secret keys are significantly
larger than just the "secret bits".  In fact, the secret key contains
a complete copy of the public key.  Since the public key generally
doesn't need to be escrowed (most people have many copies of it on
various keyservers, web pages, etc), only extracting the secret parts
can be a real advantage.
 Paperkey extracts just those secret bytes and prints them.  To
reconstruct, you re-enter those bytes (whether by hand or via OCR) and
paperkey can use them to transform your existing public key into a
secret key."

Is this a major problem?
I'm sure it happens, but does it happen with any significant frequency?
I can't imagine such a system, which has a higher barrier to entry
than the normal social networking sites, being well received.
But sure, such a system could be constructed, perhaps you could allow
two modes of registration, one requiring a trusted key and the other
requiring ID of some sort. (Now you've made yourself effectively a
certificate authority, though)

Would a smartcard address this private key compromising problem?

Not really answering your question but...
openssl could be an option, as I gather that supports a few crypto
accelerators. I presume it would use them when calling openssl enc.

I would have thought the 'secret' in shamirs secret sharing scheme

Reminds me of when some in the US was talking of Law Enforcement
Access Keys being incorporated into cryptographic products.
In Australia you can also end up in jail for not handing over encryption keys.

Dunno how likely it is, but maybe someone made an attempt at hiding
the size of the file in transit via appending arbitrary data.

As already mentioned a liveCD seems a good way to go.
I'd go for a wander down to the news agent and get a copy of a foreign
linux mag with a liveCD, say the UK Linux Format.
Your downloaded gnupg is probably fine. Your livecd is probably fine.
Since they both have to be compromised for an attack to work, you're
pretty confidently fine.
HTTPS doesn't buy us much in my opinion, webservers are being cracked
all the time.

While the ontopicness of my comment is a bit questionable....
I don't think I've gotten an encrypted email in the last 12 months,
but I still use gpg every day.
All Debian and (I imagine, or at least hope) Debian derivatives such
as Ubuntu incorporate digital signing of software.
I think signing of software to be a pretty important thing, and
represents a relatively large userbase that's not to be overlooked.
Though, admittedly, some proportion of them are indifferent towards

@_subject: On the fly encryption of files possible? 
I was thinking about this the other day, there are existing FUSE file
systems which appear to be just frontends to commands.
I wouldn't have thought a GnuPG FUSE FS would be very hard.

If you're still talking about  it's
free software. you don't have to worry about it disappearing anymore
than you have to worry about gpg disappearing. Also being pretty
simple to begin with and five years old now, there's not much
maintaining to be done.
If you lack the skill to port it and need it done pay someone to do it :)
(I'd talk to SSSS's dev, then I'd talk to the guy who made the
existing win32 port)
