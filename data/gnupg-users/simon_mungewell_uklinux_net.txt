@_subject: Changing one's Email on key pair 
Hash: SHA1
Hi all,
I've switched ISP and have therefore got a different email address (I was
previously simon
I have done:
gpg --edit-key simon
adduid simon
deluid 'old'
send-key blah blah
This appears to have worked fully locally, but it looks like the key on the
public key server still has the old UID (as well as the new).
Keyserver is blackhole.pca.dfn.de
Is this normal behavior, and if so can I mark that UID as 'Do Not Use' whilst
keeping the same key?
Simon Wood.
PS. Please cc me as I'm not on the list yet - thanks.
